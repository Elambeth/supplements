      "abstract": "The large-scale culture of Chlorella, a genus of microalgae, generates valuable products used to improve human health and produce biofuel. Such commercial applications utilized only the microalgal cells. However, the process produces tons of supernatant waste that require detoxification and disposal. A previous study demonstrated that cell-free supernatants from Chlorella fusca culture primes plant immunity in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting its potential for use as a bioprotectant. The current study investigated the effects of treatment with Chlorella supernatant on crop plants in an agricultural setting. Supernatants from Chlorella sp. strains HS2 and ABC001 were drench-applied to pepper (Capsicum annum L.) seedlings under greenhouse and field conditions. The disease control capacity and growth of plants were evaluated, as well as the diversity of the rhizosphere microbiota. Application of either supernatant reduced the severity of bacterial leaf spot disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria and enhanced pepper seedling growth in the greenhouse. Under field conditions, cell-free supernatants of strains HS2 and ABC001 not only reduced the severity of natural-occurring viral and bacterial diseases and insect infestation but also increased fruit yield. Additionally, drenching with Chlorella supernatants improved species diversity in the rhizosphere microbiota. The application of Chlorella supernatant to pepper therefore offered protection against diverse field pathogens and promoted seedling growth and productivity. Our finding provides insight into novel methods of sustainable agriculture utilizing recycled cell-free waste supernatants from the industrial culture of Chlorella.",

      "abstract": "With rising concerns over plastic pollution and climate change, microalgae-based bioplastics offer a promising alternative to petroleum-derived plastics. This study explores the dual role of Chlorella vulgaris in bioplastic synthesis and environmental remediation through its cultivation in a wastewater-fed bioreactor. By leveraging wastewater as a nutrient source, C. vulgaris achieved a biomass yield of 3.472 g/L, with 20 mg/L of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) extracted. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy validated the presence of PHA-specific ester functional groups, confirming its suitability for bioplastic applications. Additionally, the cultivation process resulted in a complete reduction of free CO2 within three days, demonstrating efficient carbon sequestration. Significant declines in wastewater contaminants, including COD, BOD, nitrogen, and phosphorus, highlight the microalga's bioremediation capabilities, making it a promising candidate for sustainable wastewater treatment. This study introduces a cost-efficient, self-sustaining microalgal bioprocess that eliminates the need for synthetic nutrients while achieving high-yield PHA production, complete CO2 sequestration, and efficient wastewater detoxification. By integrating three essential sustainability goals- bioplastic production, carbon capture, and water purification- this work bridges the gap between bio-based materials and environmental conservation. The results affirm C. vulgaris as a multifunctional bioresource that supports both biopolymer synthesis and climate change mitigation. This work advances microalgal biotechnology by demonstrating its potential for large-scale, closed-loop biomanufacturing, providing an eco-friendly, scalable solution for reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions while promoting sustainable industrial practices.",

      "abstract": "Conventional wastewater treatment technologies primarily convert complex organic matter into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and a more difficult gaseous state CO2. Most microalgae species can photosynthetically assimilate above inorganic carbon, but their heterotrophic metabolic processes often dominate in glucose-mediated mixotrophy. Herein, we investigated the carbon-fixing metabolic pathways of Chlorella sp. MIHQ61 in municipal wastewater containing complex carbon sources. The total carbon removal (73.0 %) peaked on the 6th day, and DIC removal exceeded 50.0 % as the carbon migrating amount from municipal wastewater into the microalgal cells peaked. The glucose and NaHCO3 combination promoted both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism. Headspace CO2 emission, enzyme activity and central carbon metabolism results implied heterotrophic metabolism occurred more actively in the early stage and autotrophic metabolism dominated late stage. Redefined mixotrophic carbon allocation by revealing time-dependent autotrophic/heterotrophic interplay. Carbon distribution and mixotrophic mechanism provided new thinking on how to utilize microalgae and wastewater resource."

However, the mechanism by which deuterium affects the growth and metabolism of microalgae remains unclear. This study aims to reveal the effects of deuterium on the growth and metabolic processes of Chlorella sorokiniana and to clarify the interaction between them. After deuterium treatment, cell growth and the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments were significantly inhibited, leading to reduced photosynthetic efficiency and blocked energy transfer. Under 100% D2O conditions, the accumulation of starch and lipids was enhanced, with starch content reaching up to 52% of dry cell weight and lipid content reaching 22%. Transcriptomics revealed deuterium stress inhibited photosynthesis-related genes while upregulating pathways for starch, fatty acid, and nucleic acid synthesis. These findings reveal the adaptation mechanism of microalgae to deuterium treatment and provide valuable insights for the utilization of microalgae in the production of deuterated organic compounds."

      "abstract": "The global production of sugarcane ethanol generates vast amounts of vinasse, a liquid waste by-product requiring treatment to mitigate environmental impacts. Using vinasse as a feedstock for microalgae cultivation offers a sustainable alternative. This study evaluates the performance of the native strain Chlorella sp. MC18 in internal-loop airlift flat-panel photobioreactors (PBR) for treating industrial raw sugarcane vinasse (SCV) while producing biomass. Cultures were grown in diluted, centrifugation-pretreated SCV (5-25% v/v) as the sole nutrient source, with CO2 supplied by aeration. The best results were obtained with 10% SCV. Nutrient removal efficiencies reached up to 99% for nitrates and 90% for phosphates, with reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) exceeding 75% at 5-10% SCV. The highest specific growth rate (0.711 day-1) and biomass productivity (116 mg L-1 day-1) occurred at 10% SCV, maintaining stable pH control (8.2-8.5). The PBR design enabled scalable, reproducible growth kinetics while minimising biofouling. Biomass from 10% SCV holds significant potential for energy recovery (20.24 kJ g-1) and production of high-value product pools (lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and carotenoids). These results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling up the PBR design for integrated vinasse treatment with Chlorella and biomass valorisation, reinforcing the concept of an agro-industrial sector biorefinery."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diclofenac (DCF) is a commonly utilized medication in the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug category that is released into aquatic systems in significant amounts. Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) is rich in active phytochemicals known for their haemato-immunological boosting properties. METHODS: Our objective was to investigate the haemato-immunological protective properties of Chlorella in mitigating the toxic effects of DCF. Five groups of Clarias gariepinus, each comprising 36 fish, were assigned over a two-week period. The groups were assigned as follows: control group, which received a basal diet only; DCF1 group, which received a basal diet and was exposed to 20 μg/L of DCF; DCF2 group, which received a basal diet and was exposed to 10 mg/L of DCF; and Chlorella +DCF1 and Chlorella+DCF2 groups, which were exposed to the same DCF doses as Groups 2 and 3, respectively, while also being fed a diet containing 25% Chlorella. RESULTS: Exposure to both doses of DCF significantly decreased erythrocyte count, hemoglobin content, white blood cell count, phagocytic index, and lysozyme activity, while increased eosinophil and neutrophil % in an equipotent manner. The low dose caused a more pronounced reduction in packed cell volume (PCV)% and large lymphocyte% compared to the high dose. A significant decline in platelet count was observed only with the low DCF dose, while the high dose led to a decrease in monocyte%. DCF intoxication led to a dose-related decrease in small lymphocyte% and an increase in erythrocyte morphological alterations and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. The DCF2 group exhibited a higher increase in apoptotic RBCs than the DCF1 group. Intervention with Chlorella alongside the two DCF doses significantly normalized RBC count and eosinophil %, increased PCV% and small lymphocyte%, and decreased erythrocyte abnormalities to an equal extent. Large lymphocyte% in the Chlorella+DCF1 group was successfully restored to normal levels. Phagocytic index and lysozyme activity in the supplemented groups were lower, while IL-6 levels were higher than in the DCF groups. The percentage of apoptotic cells decreased with Chlorella administration, with the Chlorella+DCF1 group showing fewer apoptotic cells than the Chlorella+DCF2 group. Histopathological deterioration and excessive collagen deposition were observed in the spleen of DCF groups, while notable improvements were seen following C. vulgaris supplementation. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that dietary inclusion of C. vulgaris may antagonize the haemato-cytological abnormalities induced by DCF intoxication.",

      "abstract": "Microalgae with rapid growth rate, ability to be cultivated in non-agricultural land, and producing numerous bioactive compounds have attracted attention for biofuel production and extraction of valuable co-products. This work focuses on the development of an industrially viable Chlorella vulgaris strain more suitable for biorefinery by downregulating the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) enzyme involved in starch biosynthesis. Transgenic lines of C. vulgaris generated through RNA interference (RNAi) demonstrated diminished starch content with an average of 6.7 % (dry cell weight, DCW) from 10 % (DCW) in the untransformed control, after 5 days of shake flask culture in tris acetate phosphate medium with 16 h:8 h light:dark cycle. Under the same growth condition, the total carbohydrate content decreased by an average of 23.5 %, while the lipid content and carotenoid level improved by an average of 19.3 % and 23 %, respectively, in the RNAi lines compared to the control. RNAi lines showed a higher yield of other important co-products, like protein and exopolysaccharide by an average of 30.6 % and 19.6 %, respectively, compared to the control. Interestingly, when polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 (0.5 % w/v) was supplemented in the culture medium of C. vulgaris grown till mid-log phase, RNAi lines along with the untransformed control exhibited enhanced level of valuable metabolites after 7 days of PEG treatment. The average carotenoid content of 25.5 μg/mg was recorded in PEG-treated RNAi lines compared to 15.34 μg/mg in PEG-untreated untransformed control alga. Under the similar growth condition, the average lipid content increased to 22.5 % (DCW) in PEG-treated RNAi lines compared to 16.28 % (DCW) in PEG-untreated untransformed control. Overall, the study encompasses use of genetic engineering tool in combination with the application of biochemical modulator PEG to divert the carbon flux from starch biosynthesis towards improved production of important metabolites in microalga."

      "abstract": "The removal of fluoroquinolone antibiotics from wastewater continues to pose significant challenges, as conventional treatment methods often prove ineffective against these persistent pollutants. However, microalgal-mediated treatment has emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging its unique potential to degrade recalcitrant contaminants. This study investigates the removal of enrofloxacin (EFX) and ciprofloxacin (CFX) by Chlorella pyrenoidosa, integrating transcriptomics, gene network analysis, and co-metabolic pathways to unravel the mechanisms driving pollutant degradation. Among the four co-metabolic substrates evaluated, glucose and glycine were identified as the most effective in enhancing the degradation of EFX and CFX, respectively. Glycine primarily upregulated genes associated with nitrogen metabolism, while glucose stimulated both photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism pathways. This synergistic co-metabolic interaction promoted the development of an integrated metabolic enzyme-photosynthetic machinery, which enhanced electron transport, energy generation, catalytic enzyme expression, and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production, ultimately leading to a significant increase in the degradation rates of EFX and CFX. Mass balance analysis revealed that biotransformation processes, including defluorination, decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and other transformations, were the predominant mechanism for pollutant removal. Fluorine was detected within microalgal cells using transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDS). A total of eight transformation products (TPs) were identified, and their non-toxic effects on three tested organisms suggest environmentally benign outcomes. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying microalgae-mediated degradation of fluoroquinolone antibiotics and highlight the potential of microalgae-based technologies a sustainable solution for mitigating antibiotic pollution in wastewater."

Microalgae provides a promising strategy for nutrients recovery, biomass production, and CO2 capture. However, due to the characteristics of high ammonia nitrogen and low C/N ratio, it is hard for the original algae to remove N and P in ADFE. Hence, this study investigated the gradient domestication of C. vulgaris and S. quadricauda to enhance their tolerance to high concentrations of ADFE and evaluated their growth and metabolic responses under ADFE concentrations ranging from 20 to 60%. The results revealed that S. quadricauda exhibited better tolerance and growth performance compared to C. vulgaris, with a 42.31% biomass increase in the 40% BG11-diluted ADFE group after domestication. Additionally, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion increased by 27.66% to help shield algal cells from pollutants. The final removal efficiencies of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and soluble chemical oxygen demand by S. quadricauda in BG11 dilution group were 37.13%, 40.64%, and 75.45%, respectively, which indicated that domestication alleviated oxidative stress to algal cells. This work demonstrates the simultaneous ADFE treatment and cost-effective microalgal biomass production, providing new insights into microalgal cultivation for the efficient treatment and valorization of nutrient-rich ADFE for sustainability."

However, the gradually accumulated nitrite levels challenge microalgal activities and system stability. This study demonstrated the nitrite tolerance (10-300 mg/L) of Chlorella sp., isolated from the PN-MBC system, and the underlying mechanism. Physiological assays, transcriptomic analysis, and bioinformatics revealed that nitrite significantly affected photosynthesis, DNA processing, carbon metabolism, signal transduction, and protein processing. Specifically, nitrite inhibited photosystem II by targeting the PsbO subunit, disrupting electron transport and the proton gradient, hindering carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. It also caused DNA damage, including strand breaks, base modifications and mismatches, with upregulated DNA repair pathways and biomass growth stagnation between Days 5-7. In response, Chlorella sp. upregulated carbon metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation to enhance ATP synthesis, while exopolysaccharides were secreted for energy storage, and protein processing was downregulated to mitigate proteotoxic stress. Evolution analysis suggested that active site variations in carbon metabolism enzymes contributed to Chlorella sp.'s enhanced nitrite resilience. These findings advance current understandings of nitrite's effects on microalgae and offer insights for optimizing PN-MBC performance under high-nitrite conditions."

This study evaluated the potential of microalgal-based biofertilizers-microalgal Chlorella biomass, de-oiled microalgal biomass (DMB), and de-oiled and de-aqueous extract microalgal biomass (DAEMB)-in enhancing lettuce growth, soil nutrient dynamics, and microbial community composition. Lettuce seedlings were cultivated with these biofertilizers, and plant growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, and nitrogen uptake were assessed. Soil incubation experiments further examined nutrient mineralization rates, while DNA sequencing analyzed shifts in rhizosphere microbial communities. Lettuce grown with these biofertilizers exhibited improved growth parameters compared to controls, with Chlorella biomass achieving a 31.89% increase in shoot length, 27.98% in root length, and a 47.33% increase in fresh weight. Chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll levels increased significantly in all treatments, with the highest concentrations observed in the Chlorella biomass treatment. Soil mineralization studies revealed that DMB and DAEMB provided a gradual nitrogen release, while Chlorella biomass exhibited a rapid nutrient supply. Microbial community analyses revealed shifts in bacterial and fungal diversity, with increased abundance of nitrogen-fixing and nutrient-cycling taxa. Notably, fungal diversity was enriched in biomass and DAEMB treatments, enhancing soil health and reducing pathogenic fungi. These findings highlight microalgal biofertilizers' potential to enhance soil fertility, plant health, and sustainable resource use in agriculture."

      "abstract": "The interdependence between microalgae and bacteria has sparked scientific interest over years, primarily driven by the practical applications of microalgal-bacteria consortia in wastewater treatment and algal biofuel production. Although adequate studies have focused on the broad interactions and general behavior between the two entities, there remains a scarcity of study on the metabolic role of symbiotic bacteria in promoting microalgal growth. Here, we use the KEIO Knockout Collection, an Escherichia coli gene knockout mutant library, to systematically screen for genes involved in the interdependence of Chlorella sorokiniana and E. coli. By co-cultivating C. sorokiniana and E. coli knockout mutants in 96-well microplates (200 μL medium per well) under white light at 25°C, 31 potential algal growth-promoting and 56 growth-inhibiting genes out of 3985 genes were identified that enhanced (≥1.25-fold) and diminished (≤0.8-fold) the production of algal chlorophyll-a content, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping of these growth-regulating genes suggested a metabolic symbiosis involving bacteria-derived cobalamin (cobU, cobC), biotin (bioB, bioF, bioC, bioD, fabF, fabH), riboflavin (fbp, guaB, gnd, guaA, zwf, purA), and 2,3-butanediol (fumB, adhE, mdh, frdB, pta, sdhC). The effects of these metabolites were further validated by supplementing the agents into the axenic algal cultures; Dose-dependent trends were observed for each metabolite, with a maximum four-fold increase in algal biomass productivity over the control. The specific growth rate of algae was increased by ≥1.27-fold and doubling time was shortened by ≥22.5%. The present results, obtained through genome-wide analyses of interdependence between microalgae and bacteria, reveals multiple interactions between organisms via metabolites."

However, the mechanism of Chlorella's efficacy on crops remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the hypothesis that Chlorella fusca CHK0059 promotes plant health by regulating the structure of the plant microbiota community. The phenotypes of the CHK0059-treated strawberry showed that the number of leaves and shoot weights was increased more than that of untreated plants. In microbiota communities, beta diversity showed no significant difference between CHK0059 treatment and nontreatment, while the CHK0059-treated root endosphere's alpha diversity decreased compared to untreated strawberries. Pseudomonas, Duganella, and Rhizomicrobium species appear to be correlated with CHK0059 treatment in the rhizosphere. These three bacteria possess the \"P461-PWY\" metabolic pathway, which can ferment hexitol to lactate, formate, ethanol, and acetate, lead to utilized phosphate solubility in soil, and potentially increased plant growth. CONCLUSION: The promotion of strawberry growth by C. fusca correlates with changes in the plant microbiota, particularly the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere. These bacteria can enhance nutrient cycling, particularly phosphate solubility, contributing to improved plant health.",

      "abstract": "The production of biodiesel using microalgae has emerged as a promising alternative to fossil fuel-derived energy. However, microalgae-based biodiesel still faces challenges in achieving commercial economic feasibility. One of the primary reasons for this challenge is the limited extraction yield of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), which are essential for biodiesel synthesis. This study explores an easily accessible ozone-based extraction method to maximize LCFAs yields to address limitations. The experiments were conducted using Chlorella vulgaris, and the extraction efficiency was assessed for single ozone treatment and the combination of ozone treatment with physical (ultrasound) and chemical (pH adjustment) methods. The results indicated that LCFAs yield (33.12 mg/g) was achieved at 5 mg/L ozone concentration for 15 min at neutral pH, which was 3.41 times higher than that of the control (9.71 mg/g). Furthermore, combining ozone treatment with 100 W of ultrasound further enhanced the LCFAs yield to 52.32 mg/g, demonstrating a synergistic effect between ozone and physical treatment. The mechanism behind the increased extraction efficiency was attributed to the weakening of the cell wall, which facilitated LCFAs extraction. Additionally, it was observed that endogenous lipid synthesis was enhanced when the antioxidant 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP) was promoted in response to oxidative stress. The extracted LCFAs in this study were mainly saturated fatty acids, namely palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0). This study offers insights into optimizing ozone-based LCFA extraction as a scalable, eco-friendly method for microalgal biodiesel production, emphasizing its potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and support carbon-neutral energy solutions.",

It has been shown that the microalgae sludge consortium (A-ASR, R1) outperformed the normal-activated sludge system (ASR, R2). In fact, estimated biogenic CO2 emissions with algae mark 1.20-fold higher removal, COD marks 1.40-fold higher removal, TP marks 1.70-fold higher removal, and NH4+-N marks 1.40-fold higher removal, compared to normal activated sludge (ASR, R2). Meanwhile, due to aeration, NO3--N concentration increased in both reactors because some Ns were oxidized through nitrification. Furthermore, COD increased again during C. vulgaris stationary growth; thus, activated sludge addition every 4 days (optimal time) was implemented to maintain algae-bacteria balance. The results suggest that integrating the treatment of GHG emissions and water pollutants in a single, concurrent process can significantly enhance the sustainability and efficiency of wastewater treatment plants, which has not been explored comprehensively. Finally, by leveraging C. vulgaris capabilities for carbon and nutrients sequestration, this study can provide practical guidance for achieving carbon neutrality in a WWTP."

      "abstract": "Emerging pollutants such as antibiotics have raised great concern in recent years, but the complex coexistence of multiple antibiotics in the environment poses a new challenge in the accurate assessment of the toxicity of antibiotics to aquatic organisms such as microalgae. In this study, the mechanism of action of a combination of erythromycin (ERY) and roxithromycin (ROX) on Chlorella pyrenoidosa was illustrated based on the physiological-biochemical response and transcriptomic analysis. The results revealed an inhibitory effect on the biomass of C. pyrenoidosa at 14 d in all treatment groups, whereas an antagonistic effect was observed in the coexposure groups. The photosystem was the main target despite the existence of multiple compensatory mechanisms, such as expanding the antenna size and initiating alternative electron carriers. The intercept of electrons on the donor side of PSI limited the production of energy, whereas the adjustment of the content and ratio of pigments strengthened microalgal adaptation. Enzymes and genes related to the degradation of exogenous compounds, including cytochrome P450 (P450), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and ABC transporters, mediated the detoxification of antibiotics. The upregulated expression of related genes induced by coexposure increased resistance and explained the antagonistic effects. The shift in energy allocation by increasing the proportion of lipids met the urgent requirements of microalgal physiological activities. This study reemphasizes the modes of interactions between multiple antibiotics and provides new insights into the mechanisms of antagonism induced by combinations of antibiotics.",

      "abstract": "Parabens are emerging contaminants due to their abundant use as preservatives and inefficient treatment in wastewater (WW) treatment plants. To overcome the limitations of WW treatment plants in removing parabens, microalgae-based bioremediation has aroused great interest as an effective and sustainable process. Nevertheless, several factors affect the WW bioremediation capacity, which must be studied to achieve an effective biological treatment. The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the effects of photoperiod and WW composition, specifically organic carbon concentration (sourced as glucose), on the ability of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris to remove methylparaben (MetP). For that, two photoperiods (12/12 h light/dark and 24 h light) were studied and the composition of synthetic WW (SWW) was manipulated to have a glucose concentration of 0, 3, 30, or 300 mg/L. It was observed that the photoperiod significantly affects the bioremediation process. For a 12/12 h photoperiod, MetP was not removed. Removal was effective for a 24 h photoperiod, with percentages of MetP removal over 88% for glucose concentrations lower than 30 mg/L, decreasing for higher glucose levels. MetP photodegradation was negligible. For the 24 h photoperiod, it was possible to verify that higher glucose concentrations decreased microalga growth, with a decrease in the specific growth rate and the production of photosynthetic pigments. Furthermore, with the increase of the glucose concentration, the MetP constant rate of degradation decreased and its half-life time increased, taking longer to degrade the contaminant (through diauxic growth). Also, C. vulgaris exhibited strong growth ability and removed over 80% of nitrogen and phosphorous, unaffected by the presence of MetP and proportional to glucose levels, underscoring its potential for treating WW contaminated with high concentrations of parabens.",

METHODS: Thirty weaned Xiangcun black piglets (BW, 11.47 ± 1.13 kg) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: corn-soybean meal-based basal diet (CON group), soybean meal replaced with 5% C. vulgaris (CHV group), and soybean meal replaced with 5% C. vulgaris and 100 mg/kg lysozyme (LYSO group). RESULTS: Growth performance was not affected by C. vulgaris or C. vulgaris with lysozyme supplementation, while soybean meal partially replaced by C. vulgaris without lysozyme reduced the diarrhea rate of weaned piglets. Plasma biochemical analysis showed that plasma albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the CHV group and the total cholesterol and HDL-C levels in the LYSO group were higher when compared with the CON group. The LYSO group had increased interleukin (IL)-10 level in the jejunum and IL-1β level in the ileum while having a decreasing IL-6 level in the jejunum of piglets. Additionally, although Firmicutes and Megashaera_A abundances and short-chain fatty acid concentrations (including acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate) were reduced in the CHV group, but several beneficial bacteria (such as Actinobacteroita, Faecealibacterium, and Anaerovibrio) abundances were increased in the LYSO group. DISCUSSION: In summary, dietary C. vulgaris or C. vulgaris with lysozyme supplementation improved health of piglets in some contexts without affecting growth performance. Therefore, soybean meal replaced by 5% C. vulgaris with or without lysozyme as sustainable feed ingredients in piglet diets could be a viable alternative approach."

However, impacts of environmental microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic co-exposure on microalgal growth, nutrients removal, intracellular nitric oxide (NO) accumulation and subsequent nitrous oxide (N2O) emission are unclarified, which could greatly offset the CO2 sequestration benefit. To reveal the potential impacts of environmental concentrations of MPs and antibiotic co-exposure on microalgal greenhouse gas mitigation, this study investigated the effects of representative MPs (PE, PVC, PA), antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and nitrite (NO2--N) in various combinations on attached Chlorella sorokiniana growth, nutrients removal, anti-oxidative responses, and N2O emission originated from intracellular NO build-up. Microalgal biofilm growth was more inhibited under 10 μg/L MPs than 100 μg/L SMX, and MPs+SMX co-exposure displayed toxicity antagonism while MPs+MPs co-exposure caused toxicity synergism (up to 66 % growth inhibition). Extracellular polysaccharides content correlated well with microalgal biofilm density under various stresses, while SMX involved stresses displayed chlorophyll a content reduction. Microalgal assimilation and MPs adsorption contributed to nutrients removal, and phosphorus removal displayed less variance among different stresses (residual phosphorus <0.5 mg/L) than nitrogen. Intracellular NO conversion to N2O almost doubled during the co-exposure processes, and N2O emission under NO2--N + PE+PVC co-exposure could offset the contribution of microalgal CO2 sequestration by as high as 176.2 %. Results of this study appealed for urgent concern regarding environmental MPs and antibiotic co-exposure on primary producers' growth characteristics and their greenhouse gas mitigation properties.",

Utilizing both the Monod and Arrhenius kinetic models, the research examines how temperature and nutrient availability influence microalgal growth and nutrient removal. The study finds that optimal biomass productivity occurs at 25 °C, with growth slowing at higher temperatures (30 °C, 40 °C, and 45 °C). The Monod and Arrhenius models, which showed strong agreement with experimental data, revealed that temperature significantly impacted growth kinetics, with the Arrhenius model accurately predicting growth rates at lower temperatures. Activation energies for growth and cell death were determined as 5.4 kJ mol⁻1 and 88.4 kJ mol⁻1, respectively. The study also demonstrated that optimal nitrogen and phosphorus removal occurred at 25°C-30 °C, with 100 % total nitrogen (TN) removal and 85 % total phosphorus (TP) removal achieved at 30 °C. Additionally, CO2 concentration influenced biomass productivity, with peak productivity and nutrient removal at 6 % CO2, highlighting the importance of CO2 levels in optimizing growth and nutrient elimination. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing conditions for microalgae-based wastewater treatment, particularly in seasonal cultivation strategies, and contribute to improving biodiesel production and nutrient removal efficiency."

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of aPDT with Chlorella on the rate of reduction of Streptococcus salivarius in vitro. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentration of Chlorella, the sublethal exposure to 660 nm diode laser irradiation, and the minimum sublethal dose of aPDT utilizing Chlorella against S. salivarius were determined. Finally, the CFU/mL value of each plate was calculated. Then, Tukey HSD and one-way ANOVA tests were utilized for comparison the number of colonies after the interventions. Results: A concentration of 250 µg/mL of Chlorella at an irradiation time of 3 minutes, was identified as a sublethal dose of aPDT for the reduction of S. salivarius. In contrast, the application of aPDT utilizing a 660 nm diode laser for 4 minutes in combination with Chlorella at a final concentration of 500 µg/mL, demonstrated significantly greater efficacy in reducing S. salivarius compared to the other experimental groups (P<0.001). Conclusion: Chlorella 500 µg/mL mediated aPDT (660 nm, 4 minutes) has a significant effect on reducing S. salivarius count."

In trial 2, performance and meat color were also evaluated. Each trial included seven treatments (0%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (%w/w on dry matter (DM)) C. vulgaris) with six replicates (three birds per replicate) per treatment. Data were analyzed using linear, quadratic, and broken-line models. Control feeds without microalgae inclusion achieved a crude protein digestibility of 82.04 ± 1.42% (trial 1) and 81.63 ± 1.90% (trial 2), while feed with 20% non-processed microalgae inclusion only had a protein digestibility of 66.96 ± 1.16% (trial 1) and feed with PEF processed microalgae at 20% had a protein digestibility of 72.75 ± 0.34% (trial 2). In general, increasing inclusion levels of C. vulgaris impaired nutrient digestibility, significantly reducing crude protein, crude fat, gross energy, and crude ash digestibility (p < 0.001). Broken-line models identified critical inclusion thresholds beyond which digestibility declined significantly, i.e., at 10% for crude protein, 12.53% for crude fat, and 9.26% for gross energy in unprocessed microalgae feeds (trial 1). For PEF-processed microalgae, only a broken line fit was obtained for gross energy, with a breakpoint at 5% (trial 2). Furthermore, a significant linear decrease in body weight (BW) (p < 0.001), average daily gain (ADG) (p < 0.001), average daily feed intake (ADFI) (p = 0.006), and relative and absolute breast filet weight was observed as microalgae inclusion level increased (trial 2). Color parameters also changed significantly with increasing microalgae inclusion level: L* showed a significant linear decrease (p = 0.029), b* and a* showed a significant linear increase (p < 0.001) (trial 2). This research advances the exploration of sustainable protein alternatives, highlighting the potential of microalgae in broiler feed and the benefits of processing methods such as PEF to enhance nutrient utilization."

However, the automated assembly and actuation of functional large-volume swarms is a challenging topic. Chlorella with self-fluorescence and biodegradability is used in this paper as a template to prepare magnetic Chlorella-based microrobots through magnetron sputtering. The assembly and actuation of large-volume Chlorella swarms are realized using a magnetic tweezer system with a robust magnetic field. Experimental results indicate that the magnetic Chlorella swarms (MCS) possess excellent degradation capability and mobility, enabling automatic navigation in various scenarios. Notably, the MCS successfully moved on the spiral channel containing bovine serum and effectively crossed the simulated channel. Furthermore, in vitro studies of real articular cartilage fragments have revealed the motion capacity of the MCS. This research provides a functional microrobot swarm platform for targeted delivery and precision therapy.",

      "abstract": "The sustainable treatment of petroleum-derived produced water (PW), a significant byproduct of oil and gas extraction, presents a persistent problem due to the presence of organic pollutants. This study examines the potential of the microalga Chlorella sorokiniana (C. sorokiniana) for the bioremediation of dissolved organic pollutants in PW. The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of C. sorokiniana in decreasing the levels of dissolved organic contaminants while examining its growth and survival in such a complex environment. The cultivation of C. sorokiniana in photobioreactors containing synthetic produced water (SPW), supplemented with synthetic municipal wastewater (SMW) to provide essential nutrients, was carried out under controlled laboratory conditions. Parameters such as biomass growth, lipid content, and the microalgae's capacity to metabolize organic compounds are monitored over time. The results indicate that, except for 100% PW, maximum biomass output after 16 days ranged from 733 to 1077 mg/L. Total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency increased with rising PW concentrations, peaking at 85% for 50% PW. The cultivation period resulted in substantial nitrogen and phosphorus removal from the enriched PW media, achieving a maximum nitrogen removal of 87% at 10% PW and a phosphorus removal of 98.5% at 40% PW. Lipid content ranged from 12 to 16% during this period. In conclusion, C. sorokiniana offers a promising and sustainable approach for the bioremediation of dissolved organic compounds in PW. This method provides an eco-friendly option to reduce the ecological impact associated with petroleum-derived PW.",

The development of a low-cost, time-saving, and small-space-suitable research method that can simultaneously remove nutrients and microalgae is highly anticipated. This work first proposed applying microrobots to eutrophication treatment. Phosphate and Microcystisaeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) were selected as representative nutrients and harmful microalgae, respectively, to investigate the efficient removal effect of the microrobots on the two. The Chlorella@Fe3O4@ZIF-8 biohybrid microrobot can not only perform the dual removal of phosphates and M. aeruginosa but also take advantage of its small size and controllable motion to achieve targeted treatment of eutrophication of water in microenvironments such as microchannels, thereby achieving the effect of fundamentally treating the eutrophication.

Chlorella sorokiniana is widely recognized for wastewater treatment. The development of high NH₄⁺ tolerant strains has the potential to significantly enhance wastewater treatment efficiency and reduce treatment costs. This study reports the identification of a C. sorokiniana strain designated hact (high ammonium concentration tolerance). This strain demonstrates a remarkable tolerance to NH₄⁺ (1000 mg/L). Integrative analyses of physiology, metabolomics, and transcriptomics demonstrated that transport inhibition is the principal resistance mechanism against high NH₄⁺ stress in C. sorokiniana. Notably, under elevated NH₄⁺ conditions, the hact strain maintained robust intracellular homeostasis. In contrast, the wild-type (WT) strain exhibited suppressed metabolic activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and an excess of detrimental metabolites such as amines. This research enriches our understanding of microalgal molecular responses to high NH₄⁺ stress, paving the way for the development of engineered optimization strategies for microalgal bioremediation systems treating NH₄⁺-rich wastewater.",

This study investigated the effect of different dilutions of a culture medium enriched with olive-derived phenolic compounds on Chlorella vulgaris growth and its ability to degrade each one of them. In particular, polyphenols were precisely identified and quantified by HPLC-DAD analysis, showing high removal efficiency by C. vulgaris cells. Notably, in a 20 % (v/v) medium simulating OMWW, polyphenol reduction reached 83 %, and COD reduction was as high as 98 %, without compromising microalgae growth or biomass productivity. To further assess the scalability of this bioremediation strategy, the study also examined the performance of C. vulgaris cultivated in an unsterilized OMWW medium at the optimal concentration of 20 % (v/v). The results confirmed that the proposed process could be successfully implemented under non-sterile conditions, a crucial factor for transitioning to pilot and large-scale industrial applications, with the system maintaining a polyphenol degradation efficiency of over 75 % within 14 days. Overall, the proposed green and potentially cost-effective process is a sustainable solution for the degradation of phenolic compounds from OMWW and the management of such high-polluting waste.",

Physiological parameters, including growth, photosynthetic pigments, oxidative stress, and membrane damage, were analysed using Flow cytometry. Adsorption experiments exhibited that ZNPs were significantly absorbed by TWPs (qmax= 312.49 mg/g). A positive dose-response relation concerning inhibition in growth was observed in all treatment groups, and it was associated with reduced chlorophyll levels and damaged cell membranes. A negative impact of increased concentrations of TWPs and ZNPs was observed on anti-oxidant enzymes CAT and SOD; however, the impact was more severe when combined with exposure to both contaminants. Elevated concentrations of ZNPs and TWPs led to increased ROS production, lipid peroxidation and membrane damage, which could be contributing to the observed inhibition in growth. In the combined exposure groups, the Independent Action and the Abbott toxicity models revealed a synergistic effect on growth rates, which agreed with the Integrated Biomarker model results. The current study could enhance our understanding of the interaction between TWPs and metal nanoparticles in aquatic systems and offer novel understandings of the mechanisms underlying their combined toxic effects on microalgae.",

The growth, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity of C. pyrenoidosa were negatively correlated with the salinity from 1% to 3%. The removal performance of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen compounds for C. pyrenoidosa decreased with the increase of salinity from 1% to 3%, which was due to the decrease of their corresponding metabolism enzymatic activities. The equilibrium between the reactive oxygen species production and antioxidant defensive system in C. pyrenoidosa was destroyed under high salinity stress and then caused an irreversible damage, which decreased the nitrogen assimilation of C. pyrenoidosa. The metabolic pathway of C. pyrenoidosa under 3% salinity had some obvious variation by comparison with 1% salinity, which led to the discrepancy in the microalgae activity and nitrogen transformation performance. Additionally, high salinity could inhibit the expression of gene associated with the chlorophyll synthesis and damaged the photosystem II reaction center. This study can provide an insight into the effect of salinity on the nitrogen removal from aquaculture wastewater by microalgae.",

A total of 180 fish (average weight 8.92 ± 0.04 g) were randomly distributed into 12 fiberglass tanks (400 L, 15 fish per tank, three replicates per treatment). Fish were divided into four dietary groups for 60 days: 0 % (Control), 0.5 % Chlorella sp. extract (CH), 0.5 % Schizochytrium sp. extract (SC), and a combined 0.25 % Chlorella sp. and 0.25 % Schizochytrium sp.

While body composition showed no differences in moisture, lipid, or ash content, crude protein was significantly higher in CH + SC (P < 0.05). Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of the growth hormone GH-I gene in the CH + SC group (P < 0.05). Genes related to digestive enzymes (trypsin, lipase, amylase) were also upregulated in all microalgae groups, with the highest levels in CH + SC (P < 0.05). Additionally, antioxidant genes (SOD, CAT, GPx) and immune-related genes (LYZII, TNF-α, IL-1β) showed elevated expression in CH + SC (P < 0.05). This study demonstrated that a diet containing Chlorella sp. and Schizochytrium sp. extracts supports growth, enhances nutrient utilization, and upregulates genes related to antioxidant and immune function in rainbow trout.

This study explores the bioremediation potential of genetically engineered Chlorella sorokiniana, expressing purple acid phosphatase (PAP) from Phaeodactylum tricornutum, for glyphosate biodegradation. The engineered strain (OE line) demonstrated complete glyphosate biodegradation at concentrations below 10 ppm within 4-6 days, surpassing the wild type (WT). Enhanced biodegradation in the OE line was attributed to increased growth and ATP levels due to the release of inorganic phosphate, indicating enhanced metabolic efficiency. Photosynthetic parameters, as well as chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents, were significantly improved, driving higher biomass accumulation. Metabolic shifts toward lipogenesis were observed, supported by the upregulation of triacylglycerol-related genes. Additionally, antioxidant enzyme activities (GPx, SOD, CAT) were elevated in the OE line, mitigating oxidative stress. Importantly, the overexpression of PAP activated and upregulated the level of endogenous CsPAP18, which displayed stable binding with glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid, highlighting the synergistic role of PAP and CsPAP18 in glyphosate biodegradation. The OE line effectively treated glyphosate-contaminated real wastewater, confirming the feasibility of engineered strain for environmental remediation. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of engineered microalgae for effective and sustainable wastewater treatment, specifically targeting the removal of organophosphate contaminants in freshwater environments.",

Until now, the accumulation and inhibition mechanism of EPS of Chlorella vulgaris during cycling cultivation is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to explore how different light qualities regulate the secretion, chemical composition, and structure of microalgal EPS, and subsequently influence the recycling of culture wastewater. After four cycles of cultivation, C. vulgaris under green light produced the highest EPS production and lowest biomass production, which were 82% higher and 17% lower, respectively, compared to white light, which yielded the least EPS production and the highest biomass production. EPS under different light qualities all exhibited a fibrillar structure with a sheet-like surface, but differed in composition. Compared with the other groups, EPS under green light showed a significant increase in polysaccharides, proteins, and humic acid-like compounds, as well as an increased proportion of arabinose and rhamnose, according to monosaccharide composition analysis. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the up-regulation of metabolic pathways linked to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, lipid synthesis, and ABC transporters promoted EPS accumulation. Additionally, EPS could target light-harvesting complex (LHC) and electron transport chain, down-regulating the photosynthetic pathway, which ultimately inhibited microalgal growth under green light. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the light regulation and circulation culture of microalgae, as well as for microalgal wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the harmful effects of microplastics (MPs) and their derivatives is a priority in environmental study. However, the characteristics and toxic effects of leachates from MPs at the molecular-level remain unclear. Herein, two conventional commercial MPs [polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE)] and two biodegradable commercial MPs [polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate/PLA (PBAT/PLA)] were subjected to leaching under ultraviolet-irradiation, and their leachates were investigated. The results showed that the surface morphology of MPs increased in roughness after ultraviolet-irradiation treatment, especially for biodegradable MPs, meanwhile, the particle size of four MPs decreased in various degrees. The biodegradable MPs released several times more dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nano-plastic particles than conventional MPs. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry revealed that lignin-like substances were the predominant component of MP-DOM, followed by protein- and tannin-like substances. The molecular composition and characteristics of the DOM varied significantly among MPs. Transcriptomic analysis showed that 737 and 1259 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed in Chlorella pyrenoidosa in PLA- and PBAT/PLA-MP leachate-treated groups compared with controls, more than in the PS (352) and PE (355) groups. These findings, verified by physiological and histopathological analyses, indicate that the leachates from the biodegradable MPs induced more damage to Chlorella pyrenoidosa than those from the conventional MPs. This is mainly attributed to far more DOM and nano-plastic particles containing in leachates of biodegradable MPs than these of conventional MPs. This study deepens our comprehension of the potential hazards of MP-leachates, and promotes the prudent use and disposal of plastic products.",

We investigated the impact of low (53 ± 1 μmol m-2 s-1), medium (208 ± 12 μmol m-2 s-1), and high (518 ± 22 μmol m-2 s-1) light intensities on the diffused biofilm-based growth of Chlorella sp. for treating anaerobically digested food effluent (ADFE). The alga grew well across all treatments, irrespective of light intensity. However, biomass yields, and productivity positively correlated with light intensity, with the highest biomass yield (120 g m-2) and productivity (11.6 g m-2 d-1) occurring at high light intensity. Notably, specific growth rates peaked uniformly on day 2 across all treatments, indicating an initial surge in growth. A relatively stable photosynthetic performance occurred under medium light treatment, while stress evidence was noticed particularly after day 4 at high and low light treatments, with higher magnitude seen under low light treatments. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and phosphate removal efficiencies increased with light intensities, reaching 100 % removal at high light after 10 days. Intriguingly, there was a notable enhancement in chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal under low light conditions, being 2.9- and 1.64-fold higher compared to medium and high light intensities, respectively. Despite the superior performance of Chlorella sp. biofilm under high-light conditions in biomass yield and uptake of nutrients, the low-light treatment also achieved remarkable results, indicating that this biofilm design offers enhanced exposure to light. Therefore, this biofilm configuration presents an enticing opportunity for treating ADFE at lower light intensities, potentially minimizing energy consumption while maximizing profitability.",

      "abstract": "As a sustainable approach to wastewater treatment, microalgae have been extensively used to degrade antibiotics. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in the degradation process remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the biotransformation mechanism of sulfathiazole (STZ) by Chlorella sorokiniana (C. sorokiniana) at the molecular level. The results show that C. sorokiniana could efficiently degrade STZ, achieving a maximum degradation rate of 94.74 %, mainly through biodegradation routes. Transcriptome analysis has elucidated the potential biological transformation mechanisms driving the degradation of STZ by microalgae, focusing on the uptake, translocation, and biotransformation as key metabolic processes. In particular, STZ induced the up-regulation of genes associated with cell adhesion, membrane protein, and lipopolysaccharide, suggesting their involvement in the uptake of STZ by microalgae. Furthermore, ABC, MATE, and MFS transporters were identified as crucial for the transmembrane transport of STZ by microalgae. A plausible biotransformation pathway for STZ degradation was proposed, identifying hydroxylation, oxidation, ring cleavage, and formylation as the primary transformation processes. The up-regulation of key enzymes such as monooxygenases, dioxygenases, hydrolases, and transferases suggested their pivotal role in the biodegradation of STZ. This research provides valuable insights into the biotransformation mechanisms of STZ by microalgae, thereby laying a theoretical framework to advance the implementation of microalgae in the treatment of antibiotic-contaminated wastewater.",

The following is the random grouping of sixty male rats into six groups of ten animals each: the control (negative control), TA-intoxicated group (positive control; 300 mg/kg body weight (BW)), Sl + TA group (100 mg Sl/kg BW + TA), St + TA group (400 mg St/kg BW + TA), Cg + TA (400 mg Cg/kg BW + TA), and St + Cg + TA group (400 St + 400 Cg mg/kg BW + TA) were all administered for 30 days. At the start of the study, groups 2 through 6 were administered TA intraperitoneally at a dosage of 300 mg/kg BW for two consecutive days, with a 24 h gap between each dose, to induce cardiac damage. Blood samples were obtained to measure hematological parameters and perform biochemical assays, including lipid profiles and cardiac enzymes. For histopathology and immunohistochemistry determination, tissue samples were acquired. The current findings showed that TA injection caused hematological alterations and cardiac injury, as evidenced by greater serum levels of troponin I, creatine kinase-MB, and total creatine kinase (p < 0.05), as well as significantly elevated serum malondialdehyde and decreased serum total antioxidant capacity (p < 0.05) concentrations. Moreover, an increase in blood low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol concentration (p < 0.05) was recorded in the TA group. There were alterations in the heart tissue's histological structure of the TA group compared to the control ones. These alterations were characterized by vacuolar degeneration of myocytes, loss of cross striation, coagulative necrosis, and fibrosis of interstitial tissue, which was ameliorated by the supplementation of SI, St, and Cg. The TA-intoxicated group showed weak expression of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (p < 0.05) and strong immunoreactivity of tumor necrosis factor-α and B-cell lymphoma protein 2-associated X (p < 0.05). However, the groups receiving Sl, St, and Cg experienced the opposite. The administration of Sl, St, Cg, and St + Cg along with TA significantly improved and restored (p < 0.05) erythrogram indices, including RBCs, hemoglobin, total leukocytic count, lymphocytes, and monocyte, to the normal control values. The administration of Sl, St, and Cg alleviated the cardiotoxicity caused by TA via reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and apoptosis in heart tissue. In summary, the current findings suggest that the treatment with Sl, St, and Cg was beneficial in ameliorating and reducing the cardiotoxicity induced by TA in rats."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the modification of polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membranes with TiO2 and Fe2O3-TiO2 nanoparticles to enhance their hydrophilicity and biofouling resistance against the marine microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. It is a common freshwater and marine microalga that readily forms biofilms on membrane surfaces, leading to significant flux decline and increased operational costs in ultrafiltration processes. The microalgae cells and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) adhere to the membrane surface, creating a dense fouling layer that impedes water permeation. The modified membranes were characterized using contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy, and pure water flux/resistance tests. Short-term ultrafiltration experiments evaluated the membranes' antifouling performance by measuring flux decline, flux recovery ratio, and relative flux reduction during C. vulgaris filtration. The TiO2 membrane showed improved hydrophilicity and antifouling over the pristine PES membrane, while the Fe2O3-TiO2 nanocomposite membrane exhibited the best performance. It reduced the water contact angle and showed only a 5% relative flux reduction compared to 60% for the pristine membrane. SEM images confirmed reduced microalgal deposition on the nanocomposite surface. Long-term tests with microalgal cells under dark and visible light conditions in saline water further assessed the membranes' biofouling resistance. The Fe2O3-TiO2 membrane maintained 59 L/m2 h water flux under visible light after immersion in the microalgal solution, outperforming the pristine (38 L/m2 h) and TiO2 (52 L/m2 h) membranes. This superior antifouling was attributed to photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species inhibiting microalgal adhesion. This study demonstrates a promising strategy for mitigating biofouling in membrane-based water treatment and desalination processes.",

More attentions were paid to its acute biotoxicity at high-dose concentrations, whereas the actual long-term effect (hormesis or inhibition of growth) of PFOS with environmental concentrations on marine phytoplankton remains unclear. In this study, marine Chlorella sp. was exposed to PFOS at low concentrations (100 ng/L, 10 μg/L, and 1 mg/L) for 26 days. The hormesis effect disappeared at the population level on Day 18, but persisted at the molecular and cellular levels on Day 24, suggesting that the stimulatory hormetic effect induced by low-level PFOS (approximating environmental concentrations) does not persist throughout algal life cycle at population level. The 100 ng/L and 1 mg/L PFOS treatments caused algal cell to swell and shrink, respectively. The low-level PFOS treatments could accelerate cells apoptosis and induce cell necrosis at 100 ng/L. Specifically, the energy metabolism associated with carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism was significantly up-regulated as well as the reduced chlorophyll content (related to the down-regulation of porphyrin metabolism) to combat the 100 ng/L PFOS rather than be engaged in divide and growth. Additionally, the decreased biomass in the 100 ng/L treatment was also attributed to certain proteins associated with down-regulations of carotenoid biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism, non-homologous end-joining, and nitrogen metabolism along with the increased oxidative stress. Our findings provide a new insight into the long-term ecological effect of PFOS at environmental concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Microalgae are emerging as functional feed ingredients in aquaculture due to their immune-stimulating and stress-modulating properties. We investigated the potential of the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris as a feed supplement to improve the health and modulate microbiota and stress responses of Atlantic salmon. Triplicate groups of Atlantic salmon (~ 126 g) were reared in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) at 15 °C and received diets supplemented with 2% (CV2) or 14% (CV14) spray-dried C. vulgaris daily, 14% once weekly (CV14w), or a control diet (CD) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, all groups were exposed to an acute one-hour peracetic acid (CH3CO3H; PAA) treatment, a commonly used disinfectant in RAS. While CV14 increased feed conversion (FCR) significantly, feeding the diets CV2 and CV14w improved protein retention efficiency. CV14 significantly modulated beta-diversity in the intestinal digesta and mucosa, but this effect was already visible in fish fed CV2. Feeding CV14 and, to a lesser degree, CV2 increased the relative abundances of Paenarthrobacter and Trichococcus in the digesta and mucosa, which are able to metabolize complex carbohydrates. However, the same diets reduced the abundance of the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus and Weissella in the digesta and Floricoccus in the mucosa. Peracetic acid exposure induced systemic stress (increase in plasma glucose and cortisol) and a local immune response in the gill, with the most prominent upregulation of several immune- and stress-regulated genes (clra, cebpb, marco, tnfrsf14, ikba, c1ql2, drtp1) 18 h after exposure in fish fed the control diet. Fish receiving CV14 once a week showed a reduced transcriptional response to PAA exposure. Catalase protein abundance in the liver increased following exposure to PAA, while superoxide dismutase abundance in the gill and liver was increased in response to C. vulgaris inclusion before stress. Overall, the results highlight that a high (14%) inclusion rate of C. vulgaris in feed for Atlantic salmon impairs feed conversion and shifts the intestinal microbiota composition in digesta and mucosa. Weekly feeding of C. vulgaris proves a viable approach in improving protein retention and improving transcriptional resilience towards oxidative stress in increasingly intensive production systems. Thereby this study may motivate future studies on optimizing temporal feeding schedules for health-promoting aquafeeds.",

In this context, first, Antarctic microalgae were cultivated and characterized. It was determined that C. pyrenoidosa and C. variabilis had specific growth rates of 0.093 and 0.097 day-1, respectively, and doubled their cell concentration in 7 days. With the antioxidant and phenolic content analysis, it was found that 1 mg/mL C. pyrenoidosa and C. variabilis ethanolic extracts had 33-37% radical scavenging activity and 102-107 mg GAE/mg extract phenolic content, respectively. Then, the cytotoxic effects of the microalgae extracts on SH-SY5Y cells were assessed across a concentration range of 6.25-125 µg/mL. The results indicated a concentration-dependent effect on cell viability, with no observed cytotoxicity within the tested range. Notably, the highest neuroprotective activity was recorded with C. variabilis extract at a concentration of 75 µg/mL, which maintained cell viability at 73.7% ± 0.3. These findings showed the significant neuroprotective potential of C. pyrenoidosa and C. variabilis ethanolic extracts, attributed to their substantial antioxidant properties and non-cytotoxic nature at effective concentrations. The promising neuroprotective efficacy of these extracts highlights their potential for therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative disease prevention and treatment."

Additionally, tests with the organism Allium cepa as a bioindicator revealed that DB22 and its byproducts did not induce toxicity, but cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were induced. We observed that genotoxicity was reduced after the remediation process. Our results establish photodegradation as the primary mechanism and biodegradation as the secondary mechanism driving the removal of DB22 within a Chlorella culture.

Meteorin-like protein (Metrnl) is a newly discovered modulator of inflammation, metabolism, and differentiation of human adipocytes. The dietary supplement Chlorella Vulgaris (CV) reduces hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and oxidative stress in clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of 12 wks of interval resistance training (IRT) and CV supplementation on plasma levels of Metrnl and oxidative stress in males with obesity. METHODS: Forty-four obese men (BMI: 32.0 ± 1.5 kg/m2, weight: 101.1 ± 2.2 kg, age: 23-35 years) were randomly assigned into 4 groups (n = 11/group): control (CON), CV supplement (CV), IRT, and CV + IRT (CVIRT). The IRT was performed for 12 wks (3 sessions per week). The treatment consisted of a daily intake of CV (1800 mg capsule) or placebo capsules. Blood samples were collected 48 hours before and after the interventions to analyze biomedical measurements. RESULTS: The IRT and CVIRT groups had elevations in plasma Metrnl, superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant capacity levels (all P < 0.0001), and reductions in malondialdehyde (P < 0.0001). Supplementation with CV significantly reduced malondialdehyde (P < 0.001) and increased total antioxidant capacity (P < 0.0001) but failed to alter superoxide dismutase or Metrnl (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although IRT and its combination with CV hold promise for improving Metrnl levels and oxidative status in obesity, combining IRT and CV do not yield greater benefits than IRT alone. Although standalone CV supplementation could favorably impact certain markers of oxidative stress, the effectiveness of CV supplementation appears to have a relatively limited effect across assessed biomarkers and requires further investigation."

      "abstract": "The membrane fouling induced by algal extracellular organic matter (EOM) remain a bottleneck in restricting ultrafiltration (UF) application during harmful algal-water treatment. In current study, the application of heat-activated peroxydisulfate (PMS) and coagulation (Aluminum chlorohydrate, PACI) on membrane fouling behavior during Chlorella-laden water treatment was investigated. The membrane fouling mechanism was analyzed using the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Over-beek (XDLVO) theory. The results revealed that separated heat-activated PMS could enhance the filtration flux of EOM at high PMS does >0.2 mM, whereas the membrane fouling was further alleviated by combined heat-activated PMS (0.2-1.0 mM) and PACI (20 mg/L) treatment, especially at low PMS dose. Combined heat-activated PMS and PACI pretreatment could effectively increase the adhesive repulsion between membrane and foulants and reduce the cohesion free energies between organic foulants than those by separated heat-activated PMS treatment, making the initial filtration flux reduced and the cake layer looser. Moreover, the organic foulants of proteins, polysaccharides, and humic-like organics were removed. Cake formation was the major fouling mechanism when EOM was treated with/without separated heat-activated PMS treatment, whereas the membrane fouling mechanism was changed from cake layer formation to pore blocking after combined heat-activated PMS and PACI treatment. Overall, this research provided a feasible method in membrane fouling control during Chlorella -laden water treatment.",

Paramecium bursaria is capable of symbiosis with Chlorella variabilis, and the symbiotic algae are situated in close proximity to the trichocysts. To clarify the relationship between trichocysts in P. bursaria and the presence or absence of the intracellular symbiotic C. variabilis, this study compared the regeneration capacity of trichocysts in alga-free and algae-bearing P. bursaria. In addition, trichocyst protein abundance was measured when alga-free P. bursaria specimens were artificially infected with Chlorella. After completely removing trichocysts from P. bursaria cells by treatment with lysozyme and observing them after 24 h, the percentage of regenerating trichocysts in the entire cell was significantly higher in alga-free cells than that in algae-bearing cells. We also developed a simple method for the isolation of high-purity trichocysts to quantify trichocyst protein amounts. There was a significant difference in the trichocyst protein abundance of P. bursaria before and one week after mixing with Chlorella (i.e., after the establishment of symbiosis with algae). This study shows the importance of trichocysts in alga-free P. bursaria as well as their competition with symbiotic C. variabilis for attachment sites during the algal infection process.",

      "abstract": "Microalgae-bacteria consortia (MBC) system has been shown to enhance the efficiency of microalgae in wastewater treatment, yet its effectiveness in treating levofloxacin (LEV) wastewater remains unexplored. This study compared the treatment of LEV wastewater using pure Chlorella pyrenoidosa (PA) and its MBC constructed with activated sludge bacteria. The results showed that MBC improved the removal efficiency of LEV from 3.50-5.41 % to 33.62-57.20 % by enhancing the growth metabolism of microalgae. The MBC increased microalgae biomass and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secretion, yet reduced photosynthetic pigment content compared to the PA. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota are the major bacteria in MBC. Furthermore, the transcriptome reveals that the growth-promoting effects of MBC are associated with the up-regulation of genes encoding the glycolysis, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and the pentose phosphate pathway. Enhanced carbon fixation, coupled with down-regulation of photosynthetic electron transfer processes, suggests an energy allocation mechanism within MBC. The up-regulation of porphyrin and arachidonic acid metabolism, along with the expression of genes encoding LEV-degrading enzymes, provides evidence of MBC's superior tolerance to and degradation of LEV. Overall, these findings lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which MBC outperforms PA in treating LEV wastewater.",

Our results indicate that C. pyrenoidosa can tolerate up to 100 mg/L of 3-fluorophenol, exhibiting a significant hormesis effect characterized by initial inhibition followed by promotion of growth. In C. pyrenoidosa cells, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), as well as the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), were higher than or comparable to the control group. Metabolic analysis revealed that the 3-fluorophenol treatment activated pathways, such as glycerol phospholipid metabolism, autophagy, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein biosynthesis, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, contributed to the stabilization of cell membrane structures and enhanced cell repair capacity. After 240 h of treatment, over 50% of 3-fluorophenol was removed by algal cells, primarily through adsorption. Thus, C. pyrenoidosa shows potential as an effective biosorbent for the bioremediation of 3-fluorophenol."

There is a need to distinguish between the many available strains of C. sorokiniana to choose the one that best fits the application. Consequently, our research goal was to develop strain-specific simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to differentiate between the different strains. Seventeen markers spanning ten out of the twelve chromosomes of the C. sorokiniana genome were developed and validated on eight different strains from culture collections and our lab, and were then analyzed by fragment analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of these polymorphic markers to detect the genetic differences between the strains of C. sorokiniana, and to serve as useful tools for the intra-species population genetic analysis and conservation genetics studies of C. sorokiniana.",

Importantly, under continuous illumination, the immobilized C. vulgaris and microalgal-bacterial consortium improved water purification and biomass reutilization. Transcriptomics of C. vulgaris showed enhanced nitrogen removal by increasing pyridine nucleotide and lipid accumulation via enhanced triacylglycerol synthesis. Symbiotic bacteria upregulated genes for nitrate reduction and organic matter degradation, which stimulated biomass accumulation through CO2 fixation and starch synthesis. The recoverable microalgae (1.94 g/L biomass, 47 % protein, 26.23 % lipids), struvite (64.79 % phosphorus), and alginate (79.52 %) every two weeks demonstrates a low-carbon resource recovery in RAS.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Chlorella vulgaris (VL) and Saccharum officinarum L. (SOL) against 5-FU-induced nephrotoxicity in rats through the measurement of renal histology, kidney damage indicators, and antioxidant measures. A total of forty-eight male rats were allotted into six groups: group 1 acted as a control negative group (control), group 2 received 5-FU and worked as a control positive group (FU), group 3 received SOL 15 mL/kg (SOL), group 4 received VL 400 mg/kg (VL), group 5 received 5-FU+SOL (5-FU+SOL), and group 6 received 5-FU+VL (5-FU+VL). After fifteen days, blood and renal tissue specimens were collected for hematological, biochemical, molecular, and histopathological examinations. Findings of the current investigation showed that 5-FU leads to hematological alterations and kidney injury evinced by elevated serum concentrations of uric acid, creatinine, and urea (p < 0.01), and a marked increase in kidney MDA and NO levels with a reduction in kidney CAT, SOD and GSH activities (p < 0.05). Alterations of the histopathological structure of kidney tissue in the FU group were noticed compared to the other groups. 5-FU administration elevated expression levels of TNF-α, lipocalin 2, and KIM1 (p < 0.01) compared to the control ones. 5-FU-induced nephrotoxicity was ameliorated after treatment with SOL and VL via their free radical scavenging, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the treatment with SOL and VL significantly improved nephrotoxicity induced by 5-FU in rats."

Batch experiments were initially conducted to investigate how biomass acclimatization in different media, dilution of wastewater, and addition of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) affect the growth of microalgae and the removal of major pollutants. Afterwards, two sequencing batch reactor (SBR) systems were tested applying different configurations and hydraulic retention times. The biomass collected at the end of the experiments was characterized for proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, amino acid profile, and the existence of lutein, β-carotene, chlorophyll a, and tocopherols. Batch experiments showed that Chlorella sorokiniana acclimatization to urban wastewater enhanced the removal of NH4-N and total phosphorus (TP). The operation of a two-stage SBR system achieved COD and NH4-N removal equal to 85 ± 9% and 91 ± 20%, respectively, while the use of a single-stage system feeding with anaerobically pretreated WWW resulted to COD and NH4-N removal of 78 ± 9% and 95 ± 9%, respectively. Analyses of biomass showed higher protein content (up to 58.8%) in batch experiments with NH4-N addition as well as in SBR experiments. The cultivation of microalgae under SBR conditions enhanced the production of pigments and tocopherols. The maximum concentrations of 1075 mg kg-1, 45.5 mg kg-1, and 131.2 mg kg-1 were achieved for lutein, β-carotene, and tocopherols, respectively, in the one-stage system.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the purification of radioactive thorium (Th4+) by Chlorella vulgaris in aquatic environments. Single-factor experiments and response surface optimization tests identified optimal purification conditions. The purification and metabolic response mechanisms of Chlorella to Th4+ were elucidated using physiological and biochemical analyses, three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) analysis, and metabolomic profiling. Increases in the Th4+ concentration caused Chlorella to self-flocculate, significantly improving the Th4+ purification efficiency. Under optimal conditions, the Th4+ purification efficiency for Th4+ in wastewater by Chlorella stabilized between 94.3 % and 98.2 %. Morphological analysis revealed that the purified Th4+ existed mainly in a stable residual state. Chlorella efficiently purified wastewater during treatment by regulating environmental pH, performing redox reactions, and utilizing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to interact with Th4+. Metabolomic analysis indicated that Chlorella adapted to the Th4+-contaminated environment and enhanced its purification function by adjusting the synthesis of metabolites, such as carbohydrates, nucleotides, and amino acids. Chlorella demonstrated a remarkable self-flocculation phenomenon and a high-efficiency purification capability for Th4+, offering new possibilities for environmental remediation. Its purification mechanism involves environmental regulation, redox reactions, and complex metabolic adjustments. The results presented here provide theoretical support for environmental remediation using Chlorella.",

METHODS: Obese men (n = 44, BMI of 32.1 ± 1.5 kg/m2) were randomly allocated to the following groups of 11 participants per group: Control Placebo group (CP), CV supplement group (CV), Interval Resistance Training group plus Placebo (IRT + P), and Interval Resistance Training plus CV supplement group (IRT + CV). IRT was performed three times a week for 12 weeks using three sets of 10 repetitions at 60 % 1RM, and integrating an active rest interval with 15 repetitions at 20 % 1RM. Participants consumed either CV (1800 mg daily) or a placebo. Pre- and post-intervention blood samples were obtained to assess adipokines which were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: While CV or IRT separately did not alter plasma levels of leptin (p > 0.05), their combination reduced leptin levels (p = 0.007). IRT and IRT plus CV increased the plasma levels of adiponectin and Nrg-4 (p < 0.01). An intergroup comparison indicated significant elevations of adiponectin and Nrg-4 in the CV compared to the CP group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of IRT and CV modulates plasma levels of leptin, adiponectin and NRG4 more effectively than either IRT or CV separately in obese men."

The side streams were assessed for Chlorella vulgaris growth and their requirement of any additional pretreatment or media supplementation. One side stream specifically, called blanching water II, a stream generated by boiling the potatoes for ease of peeling, turned out very useful to cultivate Chlorella vulgaris and concomitantly remedy the wastewater. Compared to a state-of-the-art cultivation in BG11, cultivating Chlorella vulgaris in blanching water II led to a 45 % increase in specific growth rate of 1.29 day-1 and a 48% increase in biomass productivity to 294.6 mg/L/day, while all nitrogen and phosphate present in the side stream were metabolized.

Results showed that supplementation with 20 mg/mL CPPs significantly extended the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster under high-temperature stress, improved its motility, and enhanced its resistance to starvation and oxidative stress. These effects were mainly attributed to the activation of Nrf2 signaling and enhanced antioxidant capacity.

Cultivations of Chlorella vulgaris using wastewater, wastewater with supplementation, and WC medium were carried out. Effect of wastewater collected in different months on biomass productivity (BP) and lipid composition was studied. Methods based on NMR and GC-MS techniques were applied for determining the composition of the lipids and their fatty acid profile including poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Lipids extracted are comprised of both neutral (tri acyl glycerides, TAG; free fatty acids, FFA) and polar (glyco glycero/phospho) lipids. The TAG content of the extracted lipids was determined in the range of 22.5-41.3% w/w. The NMR and GC-MS compositional results of microalgal lipids of biomasses cultivated in wastewater without nutrient supplementation, collected in different months, showed potential for biodiesel production. The fatty acid profiles of neutral and polar lipids, which are mainly comprised of saturated and unsaturated long alkyl chain (C16-C22) fatty acids, are potential sources for the biodiesel and food industry. The concentration of nitrates (45-78 mg L-1) in wastewater without supplementation, collected in different months, was found to be optimum to enable cultivation of biomasses with reasonably good BP of 21.5-28.1 mg L-1 day-1. Similar results have been obtained in the present work as well as reported in the literature in the case of WC medium (nitrate, 69 mg L-1) with BP of 25.5-28.2 mg L-1 day-1, thus highlighted the significance of the presented work.",

      "abstract": "Chlorella vulgaris is a microalga rich in proteins with potential applications in food and feed industries. However, the presence of a cellulose-containing cell wall, which is a major barrier to protein extraction, together with fibroproteinaceous complexes, limits the bioaccessibility of nutritional and bioactive proteins and peptides from C. vulgaris biomass. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different mechanical/physical pre-treatments (bead milling, extrusion, freeze-drying, heating, microwave and sonication) combined or not with enzymatic treatments (commercial trypsin and pancreatin) on protein extraction and peptide formation from a C. vulgaris suspension. The amount of total protein and peptides released to the supernatant was quantified by Bradford and o-phthaldialdehyde assays, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to analyse the extracted protein fractions. The results showed that extrusion caused a 3-fold increase in total peptides (p < 0.001) compared to no-pretreatment, and trypsin increased peptides formed in bead-milled (p = 0.020) and freeze-dried (p = 0.021) microalga relative to those pre-treatments alone. Some pre-treatments, such as bead milling and microwave, were effective in releasing specific protein fractions, particularly those from 32 to 40 kDa (up to 1.2-fold), compared to control. Pancreatin combined with bead milling decreased 32 to 40 kDa- and 26 kDa-protein fractions (p < 0.010) compared with the sole use of mechanical treatment, whereas the same enzyme mixture associated with microwave produced a similar result for 26 kDa-protein fraction (p = 0.023). Pancreatin also effectively reduced the total protein fraction released after pre-treatment with sonication (p = 0.013). These findings suggest that combining different pre-treatments and enzymatic treatments could improve protein extraction from C. vulgaris biomass, providing a useful approach for the development of sustainable protein sources. The present results highlight the need for further studies to assess the efficacy of extrusion in improving the bioaccessibility of C. vulgaris proteins in monogastric animals' diets."

      "abstract": "Further treatment of secondary effluents before their discharge into the receiving water bodies could alleviate water eutrophication. In this study, the Chlorella proteinosa was cultured in a membrane photobioreactor to further remove nitrogen from the secondary effluents. The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on microalgae biomass yields and nutrient removal was studied. The results showed that soluble algal products concentration reduced in the suspension at low HRT, thereby alleviating microalgal growth inhibition. In addition, the lower HRT reduced the nitrogen limitation for Chlorella proteinosa's growth through the phase-out of nitrogen-related functional bacteria. As a result, the productivity for Chlorella proteinosa increased from 6.12 mg/L/day at an HRT of 24 hr to 20.18 mg/L/day at an HRT of 8 hr. The highest removal rates of 19.7 mg/L/day, 23.8 mg/L/day, and 105.4 mg/L/day were achieved at an HRT of 8 hr for total nitrogen (TN), ammonia, and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively. However, in terms of removal rate, TN and COD were the largest when HRT is 24 hr, which were 74.5% and 82.6% respectively. The maximum removal rate of ammonia nitrogen was 99.2% when HRT was 8 hr.",

      "abstract": "Simultaneous CO2 sequestration and nitrate removal can be achieved by co-cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris with Pseudomonas sp. However, a comprehensive understanding of the synergistic mechanism between C. vulgaris and Pseudomonas sp. remains unknown. In this study, transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis were employed to elucidate the synergistic mechanism of C. vulgaris and Pseudomonas sp. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses identified 3664 differentially expressed genes and 314 metabolites. Transcriptome analysis revealed that co-culture with Pseudomonas sp. promoted the photosynthesis of C. vulgaris by promoting the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and photosynthesis-antenna proteins. Furthermore, it stimulated pathways associated with energy metabolism from carbon sources, such as the Calvin cycle, glycolytic pathway, and TCA cycle. Additionally, Pseudomonas sp. reduced nitrate levels in the co-culture system by denitrification, and microalgae regulated nitrate uptake by down-regulating the transcript levels of nitrate transporter genes. Metabolomic analysis indicated that nutrient exchange was conducted between algae and bacteria, and amino acids, phytohormones, and organic heterocyclic compounds secreted by the bacteria promoted the growth metabolism of microalgae. After supplementation with differential metabolites, the carbon fixation rate and nitrate removal rate of the co-culture system reached 0.549 g L-1 d-1 and 135.4 mg L-1 d-1, which were increased by 20% and 8%, respectively. This study provides a theoretical insight into microalgae-bacteria interaction and its practical application, as well as a novel perspective on flue gas treatment management.",

Chlorella vulgaris (ChV) is a potent natural antioxidant with promising applications in maintaining health and preventing oxidative stress-related diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of ChV on DOX-induced testicular toxicity. Twenty-five Wistar rats (230 ± 20 g) were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 5), including the control group, sham group (received normal saline by oral gavage daily and intraperitoneally (IP) once a week), DOX group (3 mg/kg; once a week; IP), ChV group (300 mg/kg/day; by oral gavage), and DOX (3 mg/kg; once a week; IP) + ChV (300 mg/kg/day; by oral gavage) group. After 8 weeks of treatment, the rats were euthanized and serum testosterone level, testes histomorphometry, gonadosomatic index (GSI), apoptotic gene expression, oxidative stress index, and sperm parameters were assessed. The results showed that DOX led to a significant decrease in histological indexes, testosterone level, GSI, sperm parameters, and Bcl-2 gene expression and increased expression of P-53 and Bax genes, and oxidative stress markers (P<0.05). The administration of ChV in the DOX+ChV group significantly improved testosterone levels, sperm parameters, testicular tissue apoptosis, antioxidant enzymes, and structural integrity of the testes (P<0.05). The findings suggest that the co-administration of ChV can be a promising therapeutic agent to reduce the adverse effects of DOX on male reproductive performance.",

Herein, a sustainable biological hydrogen (H2)-producing hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel patch (HAP-Chl) was constructed by loading an imidazolium-based poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) flocculated live Chlorella as a diabetic wound dressing. The PIL can flocculate Chlorella through electrostatic interactions between PIL and Chlorella to form Chlorella agglomerates, endowing the Chlorella in the central agglomerates with the ability to continuously produce H2 for 24 h under mild conditions. Combining the membrane disruption-related bactericidal mechanism of PIL and the antioxidant properties of the produced H2, HAP-Chl was determined to be antibacterial and antioxidant. In addition to exhibiting biocompatible and nontoxic activities, subsequent Staphylococcus aureus-infected chronic wound studies revealed that HAP-Chl is capable of promoting the healing of chronic wounds by effectively killing bacteria, reducing extensive ROS, relieving inflammation, and promoting the deposition of mature collagen and angiogenesis. This study provides a new strategy for constructing an in situ sustainable H2-producing hydrogel, enabling the formation of novel antibacterial and antioxidant material platforms with potential for wound dressing applications.",

      "abstract": "Chlorella vulgaris (C.V) is known for its high protein and nutrient contents and has been touted as a potential functional ingredient in food products. For this study, beef burgers were formulated with varying levels of Chlorella vulgaris fortification (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% by weight). The nutritional composition, including proximate analysis and mineral content, was determined for each treatment group. The quality characteristics evaluated included thiobarbituric acid (TBA), total volatile base nitrogen (TVBN), pH, and total acidity. The study included extracting the active substances from Chlorella vulgaris using three solvents, 50% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and water, to evaluate the effect on the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. The results showed that the water extract had the highest total phenolic content (183.5 mg gallic acid equivalent per gram) and the highest flavonoid content (54 mg quercetin per gram). The aqueous extract had the highest content of total antioxidants, followed by the 95% ethanol and 50% ethanol extracts. Meanwhile, the 50% ethanol extract showed the best antimicrobial activity, while the aqueous extract had less of an effect on Gram-positive bacteria and no effect on E. coli. For the burger treatments, at the end of the storage period, it was observed that the microbial load of the treatments decreased compared to the control, and there was a high stability in the total volatile base nitrogen (TVBN) values for the treatments compared to the control, reaching a value of 22.4 at month 5, which is well above the acceptable limit, indicating spoilage. The pH values were higher for all of the treatments, with a lower total acidity for all of the treatments compared to the control. In conclusion, utilizing Chlorella vulgaris algae as a natural preservative to extend the freshness of burgers is a sustainable and innovative approach to food preservation. By harnessing the power of this green superfood, we not only enhance the shelf life of our food products but also contribute to a healthier and more environmentally friendly food industry."

However, little is known about how storage and processing affect their lipid quality. This study aimed to assess the impact of domestic storage and cooking practices in dried biomass of C. vulgaris and T. chui. Four conditions were tested: control (newly opened package), light (storage at room temperature and daily light regimen for three weeks), frozen (storage in the freezer at -20 °C for three weeks), and heated (three cycles of 90 min at 100 °C). Lipid extracts were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS, and antioxidant activity through DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays. Tested storage conditions promoted a decrease in fatty acid content and in diacyl/lyso lipid species ratios of phospholipid (PC/LPC, PE/LPE) and betaine lipids (DGTS/MGTS). Lipid extracts from light treatment showed the lowest antioxidant activity in C. vulgaris (ABTS, IC40: 104.9; DPPH, IC20: 187.9 ± 15.0), while heat affected the antioxidant activity of T. chui (ABTS, IC40: 88.5 ± 2.8; DPPH, IC20 209.4 ± 10.9). These findings underscore the impact of managing storage and processing conditions to optimize the nutritional and functional benefits of C. vulgaris and T. chui in food and feed applications.",

The results showed C. pyrenoidosa could efficiently take up above 96% DOP through direct transport and post-hydrolysis pathways. The uptake of inorganic phosphorus (IP) followed pseudo first order kinetic model, while DOP followed pseudo second order kinetic model. Metabolite profiling revealed substantial alterations in central carbon metabolism depending on the DOP source. G-6-P upregulated glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates, reflecting enhanced carbohydrates, amino acids and nucleotides biosynthesis. In contrast, ATP down-regulated carbohydrate and purine metabolism, inhibiting sustainable growth of microalgae.

      "abstract": "Screening for sensitive toxicological indicators and understanding algal tolerance to pharmaceutical contaminants (PhCs) are essential for assessing PhCs risk and their removal by microalgae. Carbamazepine (CBZ) showed adverse effects on microalgae, but the specific toxicity mechanisms on the most sensitive algal photosynthetic system (PS) remain limited. This study delved into the impact of CBZ exposure on the growth, cell viability, pigment content, and PS of Chlorella vulgaris. The findings revealed a notable inhibition of C. vulgaris growth by CBZ, with an IC50 value of 27.2 mg/L at 96 h. CBZ exposure induced algal membrane damage and cell viability. Intriguingly, CBZ drastically diminished intracellular pigment levels, notably showing \"low promotion and high inhibition\" of chlorophyll b (Chl b) by 72 h. Moreover, the study identified a decreased number of active reaction centers (RCs) within algal PSII alongside inhibited electron transport from QA to QB on the PSII receptor side, leading to PSII disruption. As an adaptive response to CBZ stress, C. vulgaris stimulated its Chl b synthesis, increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and adapted its tolerance to bright light. Additionally, the alga attempted to compensate for the CBZ-induced reduction in electron transfer efficiency at the PSII receptor side and light energy utilization by increasing its electron transfer from downstream. Principal component analysis (PCA) further verified that the parameters on non-photochemical dissipation, electron transport, and integrative performance were the most sensitive algal toxicological indicators for CBZ exposure, and algal PS has energy protection capability through negative feedback regulation. However, prolonged exposure to high doses of CBZ will eventually result in permanent damage to the algal PS. Hence, attention should be paid to the concentration of CBZ in the effluent and the exposure time, while methods to mitigate algal photodamage should be appropriately sought for algal treatment of dense effluents.",

Specifically, the extracellular protein concentrations of microalgae cultured with pure BG-11, ethanol, sodium acetate and glucose were 18.2 29.2, 97.3, and 34.7 mg/g, respectively. During the flocculation process, microalgae cultured with sodium acetate exhibited a weak response to the flocculant because of excessive extracellular proteins inhibited flocculation. In addition, the flocculation efficiency was also less than 50.0% cultured with sodium acetate in all pH test ranges when alum and chitosan were used as flocculants. It could be inferred that the flocculant initially happened to charge neutralization with the negatively charged proteins in the solution and then bridged the charges with the microalgae.

C. vulgaris demonstrated notable resilience, thriving up to 1% crude oil exposure, while S. quadricauda adapted to lower concentrations. Optimal growth for both was observed at 0.5% exposure. Chlorophyll a content in C. vulgaris increases at 0.5% exposure but declines above 1%, while a decline was noticeable in chlorophyll b in treatment groups above 1%. Carotenoid levels varied, displaying the highest levels at higher concentrations above 1.5%. Similarly, S. quadricauda showed increased chlorophyll a content at 0.5% exposure, with stable carotenoid levels and a decline in chlorophyll b content at higher concentrations. GC/MS analyses indicated C. vulgaris efficiently degraded aliphatic compounds like decane and tridecane, surpassing S. quadricauda in degrading both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Growth kinetics was best represented by the modified Gompertz and logistic models. These findings highlight the species-specific adaptability and optimal concentration for microalgae to degrade crude oil effectively, advancing phycoremediation processes and strategies critical for environmental restoration.",

      "abstract": "The food and beverage industries in Mexico generate substantial effluents, including nejayote, cheese-whey, and tequila vinasses, which pose significant environmental challenges due to their extreme physicochemical characteristics and excessive organic load. This study aimed to assess the potential of Chlorella vulgaris in bioremediating these complex wastewaters while also producing added-value compounds. A UV mutagenesis treatment (40 min) enhanced C. vulgaris adaptability to grow in the effluent conditions. Robust growth was observed in all three effluents, with nejayote identified as the optimal medium. Physicochemical measurements conducted pre- and post-cultivation revealed notable reductions of pollutants in nejayote, including complete removal of nitrogen and phosphates, and an 85 % reduction in COD. Tequila vinasses exhibited promise with a 66 % reduction in nitrogen and a 70 % reduction in COD, while cheese-whey showed a 17 % reduction in phosphates. Regarding valuable compounds, nejayote yielded the highest pigment (1.62 mg·g-1) and phenolic compound (3.67 mg·g-1) content, while tequila vinasses had the highest protein content (16.83 %). The main highlight of this study is that C. vulgaris successfully grew in 100 % of the three effluents (without additional water or nutrients), demonstrating its potential for sustainable bioremediation and added-value compound production. When grown in 100 % of the effluents, they become a sustainable option since they don't require an input of fresh water and therefore do not contribute to water scarcity. These findings offer a practical solution for addressing environmental challenges in the food and beverage industries within a circular economy framework.",

      "abstract": "Energy is a crucial entity for the development and it has various alternative forms of energy sources. Recently, the synthesis of nanoparticles using benign biocatalyst has attracted increased attention. In this study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using Azadirachta indica plant-derived phytochemical as the reducing agent. Biomass of the microalga Chlorella sp. cultivated in BG11 medium increased after exposure to low concentrations of up to 0.48 mg L-1 AgNPs. In addition, algal cells treated with 0.24 mg L-1 AgNPs and cultivated in BG110 medium which contained no nitrogen source showed the highest hydrogen yield of 10.8 mmol L-1, whereas the untreated cells under the same conditions showed very low hydrogen yield of 0.003 mmol L-1. The enhanced hydrogen production observed in the treated cells was consistent with an increase in hydrogenase activity. Treatment of BG110 grown cells with low concentration of green synthesized AgNPs at 0.24 mg L-1 enhanced hydrogenase activity with a 5-fold increase of enzyme activity compared to untreated BG110 grown cells. In addition, to improve photolytic water splitting efficiency for hydrogen production, cells treated with AgNPs at 0.24 mg L-1 showed highest oxygen evolution signifying improvement in photosynthesis. The silver nanoparticles synthesized using phytochemicals derived from plant enhanced both microalgal biomass and hydrogen production with an added advantage of CO2 reduction which could be achieved due to an increase in biomass. Hence, treating microalgae with nanoparticles provided a promising strategy to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as increasing production of hydrogen as clean energy.",

      "abstract": "Sulfadiazine (SDZ) is a kind of anti-degradable antibiotics that is commonly found in wastewater, but its removal mechanism and transformation pathway remain unclear in microalgal systems. This study investigated the effects of initial algae concentration and SDZ-induced stress on microalgal growth metabolism, SDZ removal efficiency, and transformation pathways during Chlorella sp. cultivation. Results showed that SDZ had an inhibitory effect on the growth of microalgae, and increasing the initial algal biomass could alleviate the inhibitory effect of SDZ. When the initial algal biomass of Chlorella sp. was increased to 0.25 g L-1, the SDZ removal rate could reach 53.27%-89.07%. The higher the initial algal biomass, the higher the SOD activity of microalgae, and the better the protective effect on microalgae, which was one of the reasons for the increase in SDZ removal efficiency. Meanwhile, SDZ stress causes changes in photosynthetic pigments, lipids, total sugars and protein content of Chlorella sp. in response to environmental changes. The main degradation mechanisms of SDZ by Chlorella sp. were biodegradation (37.82%) and photodegradation (23%). Most of the degradation products of SDZ were less toxic than the parent compound, and the green algae were highly susceptible to SDZ and its degradation products. The findings from this study offered valuable insights into the tradeoffs between accumulating microalgal biomass and antibiotic toxic risks during wastewater treatment, providing essential direction for the advancement in future research and full-scale application.",

However, how ARGs' potential hosts change and the driving mechanism of metabolites under antibiotic stress in the phycosphere have seldom been researched. We investigated the response of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and the structure and abundance of free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) bacteria, ARGs, and metabolites under sulfadiazine by using real-time quantitative PCR, 16 S rRNA high-throughput. The linkage of key bacterial communities, ARGs, and metabolites through correlations was established. Through analysis of physiological indicators, Chlorella pyrenoidosa displayed a pattern of \"low-dose promotion and high-dose inhibition\" under antibiotic stress. ARGs were enriched in the PA treatment groups by 117 %. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria as potential hosts for ARGs. At the genus level, potential hosts included Sphingopyxis, SM1A02, Aquimonas, Vitellibacter, and Proteiniphilum. Middle and high antibiotic concentrations induced the secretion of metabolites closely related to potential hosts by algae, such as phytosphingosine, Lysophosphatidylcholine, and α-Linolenic acid. Therefore, changes in bacterial communities indirectly influenced the distribution of ARGs through alterations in metabolic products. These findings offer essential details about the mechanisms behind the spread and proliferation of ARGs in the phycosphere.",

The aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of the biomass pre-treatment (freeze/thaw cycles plus ultrasounds) and simulated gastrointestinal digestion in the bioaccessibility and in vitro antioxidant activity (ABTS, ORAC, Q-FRAP, Q-DPPH) of the released digests. The cell wall from microalgae were susceptible to the pre-treatment and the action of saliva and gastric enzymes, releasing bioactive peptides and phenolic compounds that contributed to the potent antioxidant activity of digests through their radical scavenging and iron reduction capacities.

      "abstract": "Bio-fillers are intensively studied for advanced polymer composite circular design and production. In this context, the algal biomass may be considered an important and relatively low-cost resource, when harvested as a by-product from wastewater treatment plants. The biomass of the algal species Chlorella vulgaris is frequently used in this type of environmental process, and its macro constituents' composition ranges from around 15-25% carbohydrates, 10-20% lipids, and 50-60% proteins. Poly (styrene-butadiene-styrene) (SBS) copolymers have a matrix composed of glassy polystyrene domains connected by flexible polybutadiene segments. Although the physical-mechanical properties of SBS copolymers recommend them for many industrial applications, they have the drawback of low biodegradability. This study aimed to assess the aerobic biodegradability of polymer composites by integrating biomass from Chlorella vulgaris at varying mass percentages of 5, 10, and 20% into SBS copolymer composites. Biodegradation tests were conducted under industrial composting conditions (58 °C and 50% relative humidity) for 180 days. The biodegradability of materials was evaluated by measuring the CO2 produced in each vessel during the study period. Potential correlations between the amount of carbon dioxide released and the percentage of biomass added to the polymer matrix were examined. Structural and morphological changes were assessed using Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Physical and chemical testing revealed a decrease in sample density after the industrial composting test, along with noticeable changes in melt flow index (MFI). The observed physical and chemical changes, coupled with FTIR, SEM, and DSC data, indicate increased cross-linking and higher porosity in biodegraded polymer structures with higher biomass content. This behavior is likely due to the formation of cross-linked connections between polymer chains and polypeptide chains resulting from protein degradation, enhancing connections between polystyrene units facilitated by peptide bonds with the benzene units of the styrene blocks within the polymer matrix."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent in as many as 25% of adults who are afflicted with metabolic syndrome. Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of hepatic and renal injury associated with NAFLD. Therefore, probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei (LBC) and the microalga Chlorella vulgaris (CV) may be beneficial in alleviating kidney injury related to NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This animal study utilized 30 C57BL/6 mice, which were evenly distributed into five groups: the control group, the NAFLD group, the NAFLD + CV group, the NAFLD + LBC group, and the NAFLD + CV + LBC group. A high-fat diet (HFD) was administered to induce NAFLD for six weeks. The treatments with CV and LBC were continued for an additional 35 days. Biochemical parameters, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the expression of kidney damage marker genes (KIM 1 and NGAL) in serum and kidney tissue were determined, respectively. A stereological analysis was conducted to observe the structural changes in kidney tissues. RESULTS: A liver histopathological examination confirmed the successful induction of NAFLD. Biochemical investigations revealed that the NAFLD group exhibited increased ALT and AST levels, significantly reduced in the therapy groups (p < 0.001). The gene expression levels of KIM-1 and NGAL were elevated in NAFLD but were significantly reduced by CV and LBC therapies (p < 0.001). Stereological examinations revealed reduced kidney size, volume, and tissue composition in the NAFLD group, with significant improvements observed in the treated groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of C. vulgaris and L. casei in mitigating kidney damage caused by NAFLD. These findings provide valuable insights for developing novel treatment approaches for managing NAFLD and its associated complications.",

      "abstract": "Frequent algal blooms cause algal cells and their algal organic matter (AOM) to become critical precursors of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during water treatment. The presence of bromide ion (Br-) in water has been demonstrated to affect the formation laws and species distribution of DBPs. However, few researchers have addressed the formation and toxicity alteration of halonitromethanes (HNMs) from algae during disinfection in the presence of Br-. Therefore, in this work, Chlorella vulgaris was selected as a representative algal precursor to investigate the formation and toxicity alteration of HNMs during UV/chloramination involving Br-. The results showed that the formation concentration of HNMs increased and then decreased during UV/chloramination. The intracellular organic matter of Chlorella vulgaris was more susceptible to form HNMs than the extracellular organic matter. When the Br-: Cl2 mass ratio was raised from 0.004 to 0.08, the peak of HNMs total concentration increased 33.99%, and the cytotoxicity index and genotoxicity index of HNMs increased 67.94% and 22.80%. Besides, the formation concentration and toxicity of HNMs increased with increasing Chlorella vulgaris concentration but decreased with increasing solution pH. Possible formation pathways of HNMs from Chlorella vulgaris during UV/chloramination involving Br- were proposed based on the alteration of nitrogen species and fluorescence spectrum analysis. Furthermore, the formation laws of HNMs from Chlorella vulgaris in real water samples were similar to those in deionized water samples. This study contributes to a better comprehension of HNMs formation from Chlorella vulgaris and provides valuable information for water managers to reduce hazards associated with the formation of HNMs.",

Due to the low concentrations of PS-NH2, the majority of them could not cause a significant difference in the end-points of biomass, chlorophylls a and b, total antioxidant, total protein, and superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde compared to the control group (p > 0.05). On the other hand, by adding ATZ to the PS-NH2, all the mentioned end-point values showed a considerable difference from the control (p < 0.05). The exposure of PS-NH2+ATZ treatments to the HA could remarkably reduce their toxicity, additionally, HA was able to decrease the changes in the expression of genes related to oxidative stress (e.g., superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and catalase) in the C. vulgaris in the most toxic treatment group (e.g., PS-NH2+ATZ). The synergistic toxicity of the PS-NH2+ATZ group could be due to their enhanced bioavailability for algal cells. Nevertheless, the toxicity alleviation in the PS-NH2+ATZ treatment group after the addition of HA could be due to the eco-corona formation, and changes in their zeta potential from positive to negative value, which would increase their electrostatic repulsion with the C. vulgaris cells, in such a way that HA also caused a decrease in the formation of C. vulgaris-NPs hetero-aggregates. This research underscores the complex interplay between PS-NH2, ATZ, and HA in aquatic environments and their collective impact on microalgal communities.",

It is used as an anticaking agent in the food industry, used to remove heavy metals from water, and used in cement-based materials. SiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by physical and chemical methods require high energy and use of toxic chemicals which is quite expensive, have a greater impact causing health-related issues, and have environmental side effects. Hence, there is a need to synthesize nanoparticles in an eco-friendly way. The biological or green synthesis method uses microbes, such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants for synthesizing nanoparticles. Algae contain natural biochemicals that act as reducing agents. These biomolecules are non-toxic as they are naturally occurring compounds and can be used to fabricate nanoparticles by avoiding the use of toxic chemicals in an eco-friendly method. In this study, silica nanoparticles were synthesized by green synthesis methods using microalgae extract. Further, the green synthesized silica nanoparticles were characterized using ultra violet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The antimicrobial activity of the silica nanoparticles against E. coli was studied.

The drying, grinding, organic solvent treatment, and ultra-sonication were combined to disrupt cells and sequentially extract bioproducts from three microalgae strains, Chlorella sorokiniana IG-W-96, Chlorella sp. PG-96, and Chlorella vulgaris IG-R-96. As the drying is the most energy-intensive step in cell disruption and sequential extraction, the effect of this step on sequential extraction deeply explored. The results show that total ash-plus contents of biochemicals in freeze-dried samples (95.4 ± 2.8%, 89.3 ± 3.9%, and 77.5 ± 4.2 respectively) are higher than those in oven-dried samples (91.0 ± 2.8%, 89.5 ± 3.0%, 71.4 ± 4.8%, respectively) showing the superiority of freeze drying over oven drying merely for Chlorella vulgaris IG-R-96 (p-value = 0.003) and non-significant variation for Chlorella sorokiniana IG-W-96 (p-value = 0.085) and Chlorella sp. PG-96 (p-value = 0.466). Variation among biochemical contents of strains is due to the difference in cell wall strength confirmed by TEM imaging. The freeze-dried samples achieved higher lipid yields than oven-dried samples. The total carbohydrate yields followed the same pattern. The extraction yields of total protein were higher in freeze-dried samples than in oven-dried. Total mass balance revealed that drying-based sequential extraction of value-added bioproducts could better demonstrate the economic potential of sustainable and renewable algal feedstock than independent assays for each biochemical."

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the utilization of amino-functionalized polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NH2). This surge in usage can be attributed to their exceptional characteristics, including a substantial specific surface area, high energy, and strong reactivity. These properties make them highly suitable for a wide range of industrial and medical applications. Nevertheless, there is a growing apprehension regarding their potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, particularly when considering the potential impact of heavy metals like lead (Pb) on the toxicity of PS-NH2. Herein, we examined the toxic effects of sole PS-NH2 (90 nm) at five concentrations (e.g., 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/L), as well as the simultaneous exposure of PS-NH2 and Pb2+ (using two environmental concentrations, e.g., 20 μg/L for Pb low (PbL) and 80 μg/L for Pb higher (PbH)) to the microalga Chlorella vulgaris. After a 96-h exposure, significant differences in chlorophyll a content and algal growth (biomass) were observed between the control group and other treatments (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The algae exposed to PS-NH2, PS-NH2 + PbL, and PS-NH2 + PbH treatment groups exhibited dose-dependent toxicity responses to chlorophyll a content and biomass. According to the Abbott toxicity model, the combined toxicity of treatment groups of PS-NH2 and PbL,H showed synergistic effects. The largest morphological changes such as C. vulgaris' size reduction and cellular aggregation were evident in the medium treated with elevated concentrations of both PS-NH2 and Pb2+. The toxicity of the treatment groups followed the sequence PS-NH2 < PS-NH2 + PbL < PS-NH2 + PbH. These results contribute novel insights into co-exposure toxicity to PS-NH2 and Pb2+ in algae communities.",

Cv suspensions were inoculated with three distinct food spoilage microorganisms (Pseudomonas guariconensis, Enterobacter soli and Lactococcus lactis), isolated from the Cv biomass. PEF treatments were applied with varying electric field strength Eel of 16 to 28 kV/cm, pulse repetition rate f of 100 to 140 Hz, with a pulse width τ of 20 μs and an inlet product temperature Tin of 30 °C. The aim was to evaluate the PEF-induced microbial reduction and monitor the microbial outgrowth during a 10-day cold storage period (10 °C). Maximum inactivation of 4.1, 3.7 and 3.6 logs was achieved (28 kV/cm and 120 Hz) for the investigated isolates, respectively. Under these conditions, the critical electric field strengths Ecrit, above which inactivation was observed, ranged from 22.6 to 24.6 kV/cm. Moreover, repeated PEF treatment resulted in similar inactivation efficiency, indicating its potential to enhance shelf-life further.",

      "abstract": "Drying is a necessary step in the microalgae production chain to reduce microbial load and oxidative degradation of the end product. Depending on the differences in applied temperature and treatment time, the process of drying can have a substantial impact on protein quality and aroma, important characteristics determining the incorporation potential in food products. In this study, we compared the drying of heterotrophic Chorella vulgaris with both innovative (agitated thin film drying (ATFD), pulse combustion drying (PCD) and solar drying (SolD)) and commonly used drying techniques (spray drying (SprD) and freeze drying (FD)). To evaluate the impact on protein quality, we evaluated techno-functional properties, in vitro digestibility (INFOGEST) as well as protein denaturation using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A sensory analysis was performed by a trained expert panel, combined with headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) - gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine volatile organic compounds (VOCs). ATFD was found to increase techno-functional properties such as gelling, water holding and solubility as well as in vitro protein digestibility. These observations could be related to induced cell disruption and protein denaturation by ATFD. Sensory analysis indicated an increased earthy off-flavor after ATFD. Interestingly, the high-temperature PCD led to an increase in cacao odor while low-temperature FD resulted in lower flavor, odors and VOCs. These results demonstrate that protein quality and sensorial properties of C. vulgaris can be steered through the type of drying, which could help in the selection of application-specific drying methods. Overall, this work could promote the incorporation of microalgal single cell proteins in different innovative food products.",

      "abstract": "Microalgal-based treatment of anaerobic digestate food effluent (ADFE) has been found to be efficient and effective. However, turbidity and high total ammonia nitrogen (TAN)) content of ADFE is a major setback, requiring significant dilution. Although the possibility of growing microalgae in a high-strength ADFE with minimal dilution has been demonstrated in suspension cultures, such effluents remain highly turbid and affect the light path in suspension cultures. Here, the feasibility of growing Chlorella sp.MUR 269 in biofilm to treat ADFE with high TAN concentrations was investigated. Six different TAN concentrations in ADFE were evaluated for their effects on biofilm growth and nutrient removal by Chlorella sp. MUR 269 using the perfused biofilm technique. Biomass yields and productivities of this alga at various TAN concentrations (mg N NH3 L-1) were 55a (108 g m-2 and 9.80 g m-2 d-1)>100b > 200c = 300c = 500c > 1000d. Growth was inhibited, resulting in a 28% reduction in yield of Chlorella biofilm when this alga was grown at 1000 mg N NH3 L-1. A survey of the photosynthetic parameters reveals evidence of stress occurring in the following sequence: 55 < 100<200 < 300<1000. A significant nutrient removal was observed across various TAN concentrations. The removal pattern also followed the concentration gradients except COD, where the highest removal occurred at 500 mg N NH3 L-1. Higher removal rates were seen at higher nutrient concentrations and declined gradually over time. In general, our results indicated that the perfused biofilm strategy is efficient, minimizes water consumption, offers easy biomass harvesting, and better exposure to light. Therefore, it can be suitable for treating turbid and concentrated effluent with minimal treatment to reduce the TAN concentration.",

This study was divided into two separate experiments. The first experiment determined the appropriate dilution rate of KWW for the growth of microalgae, sterilized KWW was varied between 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%(v/v). The result indicated that 50%(v/v) showed the highest nutrient removal by 90.23%, 85.87%, and 80.64% of sCOD, TKN, and TP, respectively. The highest biomass and lipid content were obtained with 50%(v/v) (1.447 g/L, 37.9%). The second experiment was to find an effective physical pretreatment method, which separated the biotic contaminant, non-sterilized KWW was diluted 50%(v/v) and filtered with different mesh size filters (150 μm, 50 μm, and 30 μm) compared with sterilized KWW as a control sample. The result indicated that pretreatment with 50 μm filtration was found highest nutrient removal by 90.51%, 84.74%, and 77.50% of sCOD, TKN, and TP, respectively. The highest biomass and lipid content were obtained with 50 μm filtration (1.496 g/L, 39.4%).

However, conditions of stress often restrict their growth and diminish different metabolic processes. The current study evaluates the potential of GABA to improve the growth of the microalga Chlorella sorokiniana under Cr (III) stress through the exogenous administration of GABA. The research also investigates the concurrent impact of GABA and Cr (III) stress on various metabolic and biochemical pathways of the microalgae. In addition to the control, cultures treated with Cr (III), GABA, and both Cr (III) and GABA treated were assessed for accurately analysing the influence of GABA. The outcomes illustrated that GABA significantly promoted growth of the microalgae, resulting in higher biomass productivity (19.14 mg/L/day), lipid productivity (3.445 mg/L/day) and lipid content (18%) when compared with the cultures under Cr (III) treatment only. GABA also enhanced Chl a content (5.992 μg/ml) and percentage of protein (23.75%). FAMEs analysis by GC-MS and total lipid profile revealed that GABA treatment can boost the production of SFA and lower the level of PUFA, a distribution ideal for improving biodiesel quality. ICP-MS analysis revealed that GABA supplementation could extend Cr (III) mitigation level up to 97.7%, suggesting a potential strategy for bioremediation. This novel study demonstrates the merits of incorporating GABA in C. sorokiniana cultures under Cr (III) stress, in terms of its potential in bioremediation and biodiesel production without disrupting the pathways of photosynthesis and protein production.",

      "abstract": "Municipal wastewater is ubiquitously laden with myriad pollutants discharged primarily from a combination of domestic and industrial activities. These heterogeneous pollutants are threating the natural environments when the traditional activated sludge system fails sporadically to reduce the pollutants' toxicities. Besides, the activated sludge system is very energy intensive, bringing conundrums for decarbonization. This research endeavoured to employ Chlorella vulgaris sp. In converting pollutants from municipal wastewater into hydrogen via alternate light and dark fermentative process. The microalgae in attached form onto 1 cm3 of polyurethane foam cubes were adopted in optimizing light intensity and photoperiod during the light exposure duration. The highest hydrogen production was recorded at 52 mL amidst the synergistic light intensity and photoperiod of 200 μmolm-2s-1 and 12:12 h (light:dark h), respectively. At this lighting condition, the removals of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammoniacal nitrogen were both achieved at about 80%. The sustainability of microalgal fermentative performances was verified in recyclability study using similar immobilization support material. There were negligible diminishments of hydrogen production as well as both COD and ammoniacal nitrogen removals after five cycles, heralding inconsequential microalgal cells' washout from the polyurethane support when replacing the municipal wastewater medium at each cycle. The collected dataset was finally modelled into enhanced Monod equation aided by Python software tool of machine learning. The derived model was capable to predict the performances of microalgae to execute the fermentative process in producing hydrogen while subsisting municipal wastewater at arbitrary photoperiod. The enhanced model had a best fitting of R2 of 0.9857 as validated using an independent dataset. Concisely, the outcomes had contributed towards the advancement of municipal wastewater treatment via microalgal fermentative process in producing green hydrogen as a clean energy source to decarbonize the wastewater treatment facilities.",

      "abstract": "Environmental pollution is a big challenge that has been faced by humans in contemporary life. In this context, fossil fuel, cement production, and plastic waste pose a direct threat to the environment and biodiversity. One of the prominent solutions is the use of renewable sources, and different organisms to valorize wastes into green energy and bioplastics such as polylactic acid. Chlorella vulgaris, a microalgae, is a promising candidate to resolve these issues due to its ease of cultivation, fast growth, carbon dioxide uptake, and oxygen production during its growth on wastewater along with biofuels, and other productions. Thus, in this article, we focused on the potential of Chlorella vulgaris to be used in wastewater treatment, biohydrogen, biocement, biopolymer, food additives, and preservation, biodiesel which is seen to be the most promising for industrial scale, and related biorefineries with the most recent applications with a brief review of Chlorella and polylactic acid market size to realize the technical/nontechnical reasons behind the cost and obstacles that hinder the industrial production for the mentioned applications. We believe that our findings are important for those who are interested in scientific/financial research about microalgae.",

      "abstract": "Chlorella has been applied in the production of selenium (Se) enriched organic biomass. However, limited information exists regarding heterotrophic selenium tolerance and its incorporation into Chlorella. This study aimed to investigate the potential of using Chlorella vulgaris K-01 for selenium biotransformation. To assess the dose-response effect of Se stress on the strain, time-series growth curves were recorded, growth productivity parameters were calculated, and Gaussian process (GP) regression analysis was performed. The strain's carbon and energy metabolism were evaluated by measuring residual glucose in the medium. Characterization of different forms of intracellular Se and residual Se in the medium was conducted using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The EC50 value for the strain in response to Se stress was 38.08 mg/L. The maximum biomass productivity was 0.26 g/L/d. GP regression analysis revealed that low-level Se treatment could increase the biomass accumulation and the carrying capacity of Chlorella vulgaris K-01 in a heterotrophic culture. The maximum organic Se in biomass was 154.00 μg/g DW. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding heterotrophic microalgal production of Se-containing nutraceuticals, offering valuable insights into Se tolerance, growth dynamics, and metabolic responses in Chlorella vulgaris K-01."

Furthermore, the potential of enzymatically hydrolyzed C. pyrenoidosa protein extract (CPE) as a substitute protein source was investigated. The enzymatic hydrolysis conditions for protein extraction were optimized using single-factor analysis and a response surface methodology-Box-Behnken design. The R2 value of the optimized model was 0.9270, indicating the reliability of the model, and the optimal conditions were as follows: a hydrolysis temperature of 45.56 °C, pH 9.1, and a hydrolysis time of 49.85 min. The amino acid composition of CPE was compared to that of C. pyrenoidosa powder (CP), which was found to have a higher content of essential amino acids (EAA). The electrophoretic profiles of CP and CPE confirmed that CPE has a low molecular weight. Furthermore, CPE showed higher antioxidant activity and phenol content than CP, with ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging abilities of 69.40 ± 1.61% and 19.27 ± 3.16%, respectively. CPE had high EAA content, antioxidant activity, and phenol content, indicating its potential as an alternative protein source. Overall, in this study, we developed an innovative, ecofriendly, and gentle enzymatic hydrolysis strategy for the extraction and refinement of Chlorella proteins."

In the present study, the effect of SPM obtained from Jinjiang Estuary on the physiological, biochemical, and photosynthetic properties of typical freshwater algae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) was investigated. The results showed that under different concentrations of SPM treatment, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of C. pyrenoidosa increased, but the soluble protein content decreased. SPM with different particle sizes had less effect on SOD of C. pyrenoidosa, but showed a promoting effect on CAT and MDA as well as soluble protein content. In terms of photosynthetic activity, high concentrations (70, 90 mg/L) and small particle sizes (0-75, 75-120 μm) of SPM had a greater effect on the chlorophyll a content of C. pyrenoidosa. In addition, different concentrations of SPM had no significant effect on the potential photosynthetic activity of PS II (Fv/F0) and the maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm), but the inhibition of the initial slope (alpha), the maximum photosynthetic rate (ETRmax) and the semi-light saturation point (Ik) increased with the increase of SPM concentration. Fv/F0, ETRmax, and Ik of C. pyrenoidosa showed some degree of recovery after inhibition in the presence of SPM of different particle sizes.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To explore the properties of gelatin-polyethylene glycol hydrogel loaded with silver nanoparticle (AgNP) Chlorella (hereinafter referred to as the composite hydrogel) and its effects on healing of infected full-thickness skin defect wounds in mice. Methods: The research was an experimental research. The simple gelatin-polyethylene glycol hydrogel (hereinafter referred to as the simple hydrogel) and the composite hydrogel were prepared, and the appearance and injectability of the two hydrogels were observed at 55 and 37 ℃, and under the irradiation of 808 nm near-infrared light, respectively. An electronic universal testing machine was employed to assess the tensile and compressive stress-strain properties of both types of hydrogels at room temperature. Additionally, the cyclic compressive stress-strain properties of the composite hydrogel were examined at 80% of the maximum compressive stress. Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli solution was added to phosphate buffer solution (PBS), simple hydrogel, and composite hydrogel, respectively. The part of composite hydrogel containing Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli solution was irradiated with near-infrared light for 5 minutes. After each sample was incubated for 6 h, the dilution plating method was used to detect and calculate the mortality rates of the two bacteria at 24 h of culture (n=5). The discarded foreskin tissue was taken from a 6-year-old healthy boy admitted to the Department of Urology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University for circumcision. Primary human fibroblasts (HFbs) were isolated using the enzyme extraction method, routinely cultured to the 3rd to 6th passages for subsequent cellular experiments. Composite hydrogel extracts with final mass concentrations of 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 12.5, and 0 mg/mL were respectively prepared and used to culture HFbs, and the cell proliferation after 24 h of culture was detected using a cell counting kit 8 (n=3). A total of twenty 6-8 weeks old C57BL/6J female mice were utilized, and a full-thickness skin defect was surgically created on the back of each mouse. The wounds were infected with Staphylococcus aureus solution. The infected mice were divided into blank control group, simple hydrogel group, composite hydrogel group, and combined treatment group according to the random number table, and the wounds were treated with PBS, simple hydrogel, composite hydrogel, and composite hydrogel+light irradiation (under the irradiation of 808 nm near-infrared light for 5 min), respectively, with 5 mice in each group. On post injury day (PID) 0 (immediately after the first wound treatment), 3, 7, and 14, an overall assessment of wound exudation and healing were conducted, and the wound healing rates on PID 7 and 14 were calculated (n=5). On PID 14, hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to observe histopathological changes in the mouse wound. Results: Both simple hydrogel and composite hydrogel were in a solution state at 55 ℃ and transition to a gel state when cooling to 37 ℃. After the two hydrogels were irradiated by near-infrared light, only the composite hydrogel reheated up and returned to the solution state again with injectability. The maximum tensile stress of the composite hydrogel was up to 301.42 kPa, with a corresponding strain of 87.19%; the maximum compressive stress was up to 413.79 kPa, with a corresponding strain of 91.67%, which was similar to the tensile and compressive properties of the simple hydrogel. After 10 compression cycles, the maximum compressive stress of the composite hydrogel still reached 84.1% of the first compressive stress. After 24 h of culture, the mortality rate of Staphylococcus aureus treated with simple hydrogel was significantly higher than that treated with PBS (P<0.05); the mortality rates of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus treated with composite hydrogel alone were significantly higher than those treated with simple hydrogel (P<0.05); the mortality rates of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus treated with composite hydrogel+light irradiation were significantly higher than those treated with composite hydrogel alone (P<0.05). After 24 h of culture, compared with that cultured in composite hydrogel immersion solution with final mass concentration of 0 mg/mL, the proliferation activity of HFbs cultured in composite hydrogel immersion solution with final mass concentrations of 25.0 and 50.0 mg/mL was significantly enhanced (P<0.05), while the proliferation activity of HFbs cultured in composite hydrogel immersion solution with final mass concentration of 100 mg/mL was significantly decreased (P<0.05). On PID 0 and 3, more purulent secretions were seen in the wounds of mice in blank control group and simple hydrogel group, while only a small amount of exudate was observed in the wounds of mice in composite hydrogel group, and no obvious infection was observed in the wounds of mice in combined treatment group. On PID 7 and 14, the wound healing rates of mice in simple hydrogel group were significantly higher than those in blank control group (P<0.05); the wound healing rates of mice in composite hydrogel group were significantly higher than those in simple hydrogel group (P<0.05); the wound healing rates in combined treatment group were significantly higher than those in composite hydrogel group (P<0.05). On PID 14, the wounds of mice in blank control group exhibited a high infiltration of inflammatory cells with no new epithelial layer observed; the wounds of mice in simple hydrogel group displayed a short length of newly formed epithelium with a small amount of inflammatory cells; the wounds of mice in composite hydrogel group exhibited continuous formation of new epithelium and a large amount of immature granulation tissue; the wounds of mice in combined treatment group showed continuous epithelialization with less immature granulation tissue. Conclusions: The prepared composite hydrogel exhibits excellent thermosensitivity, photothermal properties, and injectability, as well as excellent mechanical properties, antibacterial properties, and biocompatibility, and can promote the healing of infected full-thickness skin defect wounds in mice.",

      "abstract": "The CO2 emission is increasing every year and threatening both humans and the ecosystem. Carbon capture technological innovations have emerged as a potential solution to mitigate this emissions. Due to its high capacity of photosynthetic activity, CO2 sequestration by microalgae, such as Chlorella vulgaris has attracted much attention as a carbon capture system. The growth of this microalgae is influenced by various physicochemical factors. By designing the Design of Experiment (DoE) with Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effect of several independent factor can be evaluated to optimize Chlorella vulgaris growth condition and CO2 conversion. This study aims to identify the most impact factors affecting C. vulgaris growth through investigating the variations in physicochemical factors of aeration, initial pH, dark light regime, saline, and substrates concentration using DoE. In this study, C. vulgaris was cultivated in batch culture for 10 days with 8 experiments that were designed under various conditions as per experimental run. Biomass growth was observed using optical density and analyzed by first order regression. The result shows that aeration parameters was statistically significant affect microalgae growth, evidence by p-value below 0.05 at all observation points. Runs with aeration treatment showed a prolonged exponential growth phase and delayed onset of the deceleration phase. Additionally, this study also found that the initial pH level also significantly affects growth at the last day of cultivation. Cultures with a higher initial pH reached the stationary phase earlier than those with a lower pH. Thus, the growth of C. vulgaris can be optimized by adding aeration treatment into culture media and regulating initial pH around 8 to enhancing carbon fixation and biomass yield."

      "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognition. BDNF is a neurotrophin that binds to tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), a specific receptor on target cell surfaces; it acts on neuronal formation, development, growth, and repair via transcription factors, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and it is involved in learning and memory. BDNF expression is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exercise and the intake of several different foods or ingredients can increase BDNF expression, as confirmed with lutein, xanthophylls (polar carotenoids), and ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn), which are present at high levels in the brain. This study examined the effects of combining lutein and PlsEtn using lutein-rich Chlorella and ascidian extracts containing high levels of PlsEtn bearing docosahexaenoic acid, which is abundant in the human brain, on the activation of the BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. Although activation of the BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus was not observed in Chlorella or ascidian PlsEtn monotherapy, activation was observed with combination therapy at an equal dose. The results of this study suggest that the combination of Chlorella and ascidian PlsEtn may have a preventive effect against dementia, including AD.",

However, swine wastewater often contains heavy metal ions, such as Cu (II), which may have impacts on the nutrient removal performance of C. vulgaris. Additionally, the heavy metal ions in wastewater can be adsorbed by microalgae. In this study, the stress effect of Cu (II) on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris, the Cu (II) removal by microalgae, and the effect of different concentrations of Cu (II) on the nutrient removal efficiency of C. vulgaris in biogas slurries were explored. The results showed that the microalgae biomass of microalgae on the sixth day of the experiment was the highest in the treatment with a Cu (II) concentration of 0.5 mg/L, which was 30.1% higher than that of the 2.5 mg/L group. C. vulgaris had higher removal efficiencies of Cu (II) at a Cu (II) concentration of 0.1~1.5 mg/L. The-OH, C=O, -COOH, and C-O groups on the surface of the algal cells play a significant role in the removal of Cu (II). The removal rates of COD, NH3-N, TN, and TP by C. vulgaris at a Cu (II) concentration of 0.5 mg/L were the highest, which were 89.0%, 53.7%, 69.6%, and 47.3%, respectively."
