      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In patients with diabetes intending to fast, Ramadan, risk assessment, and stratification are essential for an individualized treatment plan. It seems that the new IDF-DAR risk stratification tool (International Diabetes Federation - Diabetes and Ramadan Alliance) has become the primary tool in this setting. This study aims to validate this tool in the Abu Dhabi population. METHOD: The assessment was performed before Ramadan, followed by an evaluation of any significant outcome after Ramadan through tele-interview and an electronic medical records review. Patients were included if the attending physicians used the tool in the risk assessment of the patients within 6 weeks before Ramadan 1,444 (CE 2022) in the AHS healthcare center. RESULTS: The study included 435 patients. Half (51.7%) were in the low-risk category of the IDF-DAR risk stratification tool, 28.5% were in the moderate-risk category, and 19.8% were in the higher-risk category. Of the total patients, 81.3% fasted during the entire Ramadan period and 18.7% attempted to fast. A total of 14 (3.8%) patients were admitted at least once, and 56 (12.9%) had at least one significant event, including admission to the hospital. Using univariable logistic regression, the occurrence of adverse events was significantly associated with more days not fasted, B = -0.126, p < 0.001, OR = 0.88 (0.839-0.927). Using multivariable logistic regression, and after controlling for all variables studied, other risk factors identified with the occurrence of adverse events in this study were as follows: being in the low-risk category of the DAR risk assessment tool, B = -1.1, OR = 0.34 (0.157-0.744), p = 0.0072; being in the frail category compared to the reference category, the robust category, B = 1.54, OR = 4.6 (1.3-16.6), p = 0.018; and older age B = -0.034, OR = 0.966 (0.938-0.995). There was no significant difference between moderate- and high-risk categories in the occurrence of significant adverse events (SAEs). Similar determinants of fasting were identified during the entire Ramadan period using multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSION: According to the IDF-DAR risk assessment, patients with diabetes in the low-risk category had a better outcome than those in the moderate- or high-risk categories regarding SAEs. Another independent risk factor is if the patient is frail, according to the FRAIL scoring."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over two billion Muslims across the world practice Ramadan fasting, which involves refraining from food and drink from dawn to sunset. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Ramadan fasting on mental health (depression, anxiety, stress), body composition, physical activity, and sleep quality among Jordanian university students. METHODS: This study utilized a quasi-experimental, pre-post-intervention design. It was conducted between March and April 2024 and included 77 students from the University of Petra (UOP) in Amman, Jordan. Bivariate analysis was performed to compare the variables pre-post Ramadan fasting. A linear mixed-effects model assessed the association between Ramadan fasting and each outcome. RESULTS: The results indicated that Ramadan fasting was not associated with a change in the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21 score). Ramadan fasting led to a decrease in sleep quality, indicated by an increase in the PSQI score (β = 0.92; p-value = 0.0419). Component analysis revealed statistically significant changes in subjective sleep quality (p-value = 0.0009), sleep duration (p-value < 0.0001), and sleep disturbances (p-value = 0.025). Body composition: Ramadan fasting was significantly associated with a decrease in the number of fat components, such as weight (β = -1.20; p-value = 0.0116), body mass index (β = -0.55), waist circumference (β = -1.79; p-value = 0.0029), fat mass index (β = -0.43; p-value = 0.0279), visceral fat area (β = -6.86; p-value = 0.0383), and body adiposity index (β = -0.45; p-value = 0.0068) (all p-value < 0.05). No substantial alterations to the body's water-related properties were noted. Physical Activity: A marked decrease was noted in moderate- to high-intensity activity levels (p-value < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Ramadan fasting can positively affect body composition through a reduction in weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and other parameters of fat, emphasizing its potential role in body composition improvement. However, fasting was also accompanied by poorer sleep quality, including, specifically, poorer subjective sleep quality and sleep duration and greater disturbance. The associated impairments to sleep revealed in these findings demand strategies to mitigate sleep impairments, alongside, where possible, potential beneficial effects of fasting on body composition."

      "abstract": "During Ramadan, Muslims fast to spiritually prepare their bodies and spirits. The autophagy pathway restores cellular homeostasis and is being studied as a therapy for a variety of disorders. According to previous studies, fasting or calorie restriction has a role in the up-regulation of autophagy especially through the initiation step. The effects of Ramadan fasting on the autophagy pathways and metabolic health outcome in healthy adults were investigated in this study. In this controlled cohort study, 50 healthy subjects (20-78 years old) 24-fasting and 26 non-fasting were included. At the end of Ramadan, a blood was drawn to assess biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory variables. Serum IL-6 and hs-CRP levels were measured. The serum proteins (Beclin-1 and LC3β) and mRNAs gene expressions' (Beclin-1, p62, and LC3β) of the autophagy marker were evaluated by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively. During Ramadan, there were no significant differences for biochemical parameters (except for BUN-level), inflammatory markers (IL-6 and hs-CRP), and hematological indices during Ramadan. Beclin-1 gene expression was significantly upregulated in the fasting-group as the main marker of initiation of autophagy; yet, the LC3β and the p62 levels were decreased in the fasting-group in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, fasting women alone displayed a significantly high serum Beclin-1 level. Ramadan fasting does not have any adverse effects on biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory parameters. According to our results, people observing Ramadan may benefit from the autophagy pathway to compensate reduction in energy and vital metabolites in the face of food restriction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ramadan fasting presents unique challenges for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to alterations in diet and medication regimens. This study evaluates the effects of Ramadan fasting on glycemia by utilizing the glycemia risk index (GRI), which integrates both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic risks into a unified metric, alongside continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. In addition, the study examines the correlation between GRI and diabetes therapy-related quality of life (DTR-QOL) to understand the broader impact on patient outcomes. METHODS: An ambispective, one-group pre-post design was employed at a tertiary diabetes treatment center, involving 111 adults with T2D. Data were collected across three periods: one month before Ramadan, during, and one month after. Clinical, metabolic, and glycemic parameters were recorded. The CGM-based calculations included GRI, with its hypoglycemia component (CHypo) and hyperglycemia component (CHyper). The DTR-QOL was measured to evaluate therapy-related quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: During Ramadan, GRI significantly decreased (median = 30.5) compared to before (35.2) and after (37.4; P < .001), indicating improved glycemic stability. Both CHypo and CHyper were significantly reduced during fasting. The %TIR70-180 increased from 42% before to 66% during (P < .001), accompanied by a notable decrease in glycemic variability. The DTR-QOL scores were high across all domains, reflecting a positive therapy-related QoL (scale score: 78.3 [interquartile range = 75.4-81.3]). No significant differences were observed across GRI zones. CONCLUSIONS: With tailored education and CGM-based monitoring, Ramadan fasting can improve glycemia in individuals with T2D, enhancing GRI and related glycometric parameters for safer, more stable glycemic patterns."

      "abstract": "Time-restricted intermittent fasting (TRIF) has gained popularity as an intervention for addressing overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. It may influence the composition of the gut microbiome, potentially affecting various microbiome-mediated functions in humans. However, limited studies have been conducted involving TRIF and microbiome on developing and underdeveloped populations. Here, we investigated the impact of TRIF/Ramadan fasting (16:8) on the changes of gut microbiome and functional profiling of microbial communities during and after the month of Ramadan in Pakistani Expats living in China. We observed substantial change in alpha diversity during TRIF; the changes in gut microbial structure by the end of TRIF were higher vis-a-vis in the beginning. Significant differences were observed among individuals; several bacteria (Clostridium perfringens, Coprococcus comes, and Lactococcus lactis, among others) were changed significantly (p < 0.05). Additionally, amino acid, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism; glycan biosynthesis; and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were significantly affected by TRIF. Pyridoxamine, glutamate, citrulline, arachidonic acid, and short-chain fatty acids showed substantial differences at different time points based on the predicted metabolic pathways. The preliminary results from this study demonstrate significant potential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying gut microbiome stability and enhancing the effectiveness of microbiome-tailored interventions among the Pakistani populace to ameliorate metabolic disorders."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: This case report aims to highlight the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, surgical intervention, and subsequent management strategies of ISK during Ramadan fasting. CASE PRESENTATION: 52-Year-old male with a three-day history of symptoms of intestinal obstruction. He complained of abdominal distention, vomiting, and absolute constipation. He had hypotension and tachycardia, as well as asymmetric abdominal distension. Laboratory investigations revealed a biological inflammatory syndrome and anemia. The abdominal CT scan showed significant aerated distension of the sigmoid colon. The sigmoid wall appeared to be dilated. Extra-digestive air bubbles were observed near the transition level, along with moderate intraperitoneal effusion. We found severe acute necrosis of the sigmoid colon and distal ileum, accompanied by a large volume of putrid ascitic fluid. The sigmoid was wrapped around the ilium. A Hartmann procedure was performed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. DISCUSSION: ISK, also known as compound volvulus or double volvulus, is a rare and life-threatening intestinal obstruction caused by the twisting of the ileum and sigmoid colon around each other. The incidence of ISK is not known. The exact cause of ISK is unknown. Ingestion of heavy meals when the small intestine is empty. This may explain the high incidence during Ramadan. ISK is classified into four types according to the direction. This classification is more useful for predicting mortality and morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: ISK is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction and intestinal ischemia. It is important to differentiate between the Knott ileosigmoid and the simple volvulus of the sigmoid to avoid morbidity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a chronic bone metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly the elderly and postmenopausal women. It is characterized by weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. The goal of the current study is to examine the reported osteo-preservative effects of exercise and/or fasting in the Ramadan fasting model (RFM) in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. METHODS: The experimental intervention started 1 month following the ovariectomy procedure and consisted of five 15-min exercise sessions per week at 18-25 m/min and/or an approximately 13-h fast from sunrise to sunset (6:00 AM-19:00 PM). Serum bone metabolism biomarker levels were measured, and mineral concentrations in femoral ashed bones and digested serum were determined. Additionally, serum bone alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP), parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, calcitonin, and vitamin D3 concentrations were measured using the competitive enzyme immunoassay technique. RESULTS: Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus showed a notable decrease in mineral concentration among OVX rat femurs compared with the combination group (OVX + RFM + E) and control groups. In addition, homeostasis of serum concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus was observed to increase in the OVX + RFM + E group rather than in the OVX group without intervention when compared with a control group. Furthermore, fasting and exercise, either alone or concurrently with ovariectomy, induced a non-significant elevation in osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D3, whereas b-ALP and calcitonin increased significantly compared with those in control rats. CONCLUSION: The combination of the Ramadan fasting model and moderate intensity exercises among OVX rats manifested advantageous effects in bone biomarkers compared with OVX rats without intervention. This could be recommended as a lifestyle modification that is protective against osteoporosis, especially in the context of depleted estrogen hormone after menopause."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: For Muslim patients on levothyroxine (L-T4) therapy, the best approach for L-T4 intake during Ramadan fasting remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We compared 2 practical approaches for L-T4 intake during Ramadan. METHODS: We randomly assigned 69 patients (21 males, 48 females, median age 44 years) with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who underwent thyroidectomy in the past and are on stable LT4 doses to 2 arms. Arm A (33 patients) ingested their pre-Ramadan L-T4 dose at the evening meal and ate immediately. Arm B (36 patients) increased their pre-Ramadan dose by 25 µg if their regular L-T4 dose was ≤150 µg/day or by 50 µg if their pre-Ramadan dose was >150 µg/day and ate immediately. RESULTS: At the beginning of Ramadan (baseline), the median thyrotropin (TSH) level and the numbers of patients in euthyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism (Shyper), or subclinical hypothyroidism (Shypo) were comparable between the 2 arms (P = .69 and P = .65, respectively). At the end of Ramadan, in arm A there were 17 (51.5%), 3 (9.1%), and 13 (39.4%) patients in euthyroidism, Shyper, and Shypo compared with 17 (47.2%), 14 (38.9%), and 5 (13.9%) patients, respectively, in arm B (P = .005). The mean ± SD TSH levels in arms A and B at the end of Ramadan were 5.6 ± 6.0 mU/L and 1.67 ± 2.6 mU/L, respectively (P = .0001). CONCLUSION: No overt thyroid dysfunction developed but there were more cases of Shypo in arm A and Shyper in arm B. Arm B achieved desirable levels of TSH (normal or slightly suppressed) in 86% of cases and might be a preferable approach, especially for patients who need TSH suppression (eg, DTC)."

METHODS: Of the 420 eligible participants from the SoliRam study, 174 were using SGLT-2i in addition to iGlarLixi and 246 were not using SGLT-2i, referred to as SGLT-2i user and non-user, respectively. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants experiencing ≥ 1 severe and/or symptomatic documented (< 70 mg/dl [< 3.9 mmol/l]) hypoglycemia. RESULTS: More than 50% of participants in both groups were male. The mean weight, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were similar in both groups. Approximately half of participants in the SGLT-2i-user group and ~ 25% participants in the SGLT-2i-non-user group were on two oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs (OADs), whereas ~ 20% in the SGLT-2i-user group and ~ 1% of participants in the SGLT-2i-non-user group were on three OADs in addition to iGlarLixi. Around 35% and 55% of participants in the SGLT-2i-user and SGLT-2i-non-user groups, respectively, were taking concurrent sulphonylureas. About 97% of participants in both groups were able to fast for ≥ 25 days. The incidence of primary endpoint was low in both groups; SGLT-2i user: 0.6%, 4.2%, and 0.6% and SGLT-2i-non-user: 1.3%, 0.9% and 0% during pre-Ramadan, Ramadan, and post-Ramadan period, respectively. The incidence of severe and/or symptomatic documented (< 54 mg/dl [< 3.0 mmol/l]) hypoglycemia events was also low throughout the study, including during Ramadan. No severe hypoglycemia occurred during Ramadan in either group. Improvements in HbA1c and FPG, with a small reduction in weight, were observed from pre- to post-Ramadan in both groups. No serious adverse event was reported in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant iGlarLixi and SGLT-2i therapy with or without other OADs was demonstrated to be safe in adults with T2D during Ramadan fast, with a low risk of hypoglycemia and improvements in glycemic outcomes."

A limited number of studies have investigated the potential effect of Ramadan fasting on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). There is no single medication for the treatment of MASLD. There is a growing interest in dietary intervention as potential treatment for metabolic diseases including MASLD. The aim of this study was to discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk factors of MASLD and the potential effects of Ramadan fasting on MASLD, liver transplant, and bariatric surgery. We searched PubMed and SCOPUS databases using different search terms. The literature search was based on research studies published in English from the year 2000 to the 2024. Thirty-two studies were included in this review. Ramadan fasting reduced body weight and improved lipid profile, anthropometric indices, fasting plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and inflammatory cytokines. Ramadan fasting improved risk factors of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and might improve MASLD through weight reduction. However, further studies are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of Ramadan fasting in liver transplant recipients and bariatric surgery."

      "abstract": "Aging is a fundamental biological process that progressively impairs the functionality of the bodily systems, leading to an increased risk of diseases. Telomere length is one of the most often used biomarkers of aging. Recent research has focused on developing interventions to mitigate the effects of aging and improve the quality of life. The objective of this study was to investigate the combined effect of exercise and Ramadan fasting on telomere length. Twenty-nine young, non-obese, healthy females were randomized into two groups: the control group underwent a 4-week exercise training program, and the second group underwent a 4-week exercise training program while fasting during Ramadan. Blood samples were collected, and measurements of clinical traits, cytokines, oxidative stress, and telomere length were performed before and after intervention. Telomere length increased significantly from baseline in the exercise-while-fasting group, but showed no significant change in the exercise control group. This increase was accompanied by a reduction in TNF-α, among other cytokines. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was observed between the mean change in telomere length and HDL in the exercise-while-fasting group only. This study is the first to report an increase in telomere length after combining Ramadan fasting with training, suggesting that exercising while fasting may be an effective tool for slowing down the aging rate. Further studies using larger and more diverse cohorts are warranted."

Material and Method: This real-life prospective study involved 20 patients with T1D and moderate to high-risk score of adverse events at baseline. We compared continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) parameters under HCL therapy 1 month before and during the Ramadan fasting month. The main outcome was the evolution of the percentage of time-in-range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL) between the two time points, and secondary outcomes were the evolution of other CGM parameters and frequency of acute metabolic events. Results: We observed no statistical difference regarding TIR (mean±SD) (63 ± 11% during fasting vs. 62 ± 12% before) as well as for other parameters including time spent under 70 mg/dL (1.1 ± 1.0% vs. 1.5 ± 1.3%) and percentage of HCL use (93 ± 5% vs. 94 ± 5%). No acute metabolic event was observed during fasting under HCL. Results were homogenous across baseline risk score groups.",

This study investigates the impact of RIF on hormonal levels among healthy individuals during Ramadan. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of previously published studies were conducted, focusing on healthy non-athlete adults. The intervention examined was Ramadan Intermittent Fasting, and the primary outcomes assessed were changes in endocrine hormonal and biochemical parameters. The pooled effect measure was expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 35 original articles were retrieved, with a combined sample size of 1,107 participants eligible for the meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between pre- and post-Ramadan hormonal levels of T3, T4, TSH, FT3, FT4, Testosterone, LH, FSH, Prolactin, PTH, Calcium, and Phosphorus (P-value<0.05). However, a substantial decrease in morning cortisol levels was observed across the studies (P-value: 0.08, Hedges' g = -2.14, 95% CI: -4.54, 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Ramadan Intermittent Fasting results in minimal hormonal changes and is a safe practice for healthy individuals. The fasting regimen appears to disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to a decrease in morning cortisol levels.",

      "abstract": "Fasting during the month of Ramadan is a religious practice observed by millions of Muslims worldwide, including those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This comprehensive review aims to reflect upon the impacts of Ramadan fasting on CKD patients, excluding those on renal replacement therapy, through an analysis of clinical trials, observational studies, and expert reviews from diverse geographic and methodological backgrounds. It addresses renal function stability, broader health considerations, hydration and electrolyte balance, individual variability in fasting responses, clinical and biochemical effects, nutritional considerations, and metabolic effects. This review reveals that, with appropriate monitoring, dietary management, and individualized care plans, many CKD patients can safely participate in Ramadan fasting without adversely affecting their renal function or overall health. It emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach to patient education, pre-Ramadan assessment, and post-Ramadan follow-up. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of considering individual variability and comorbidities in fasting guidance and underscores the necessity of future research to develop robust, patient-centered fasting guidelines. This review aims to provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations to support CKD patients wishing to observe Ramadan fasting, ensuring patient safety and optimizing care outcomes."

Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to analyze and summarize all clinical studies regarding the impacts of Ramadan fasting for patients with NAFLD. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of the Embase, Cochrane, and PubMed databases from inception to September 1, 2023. All clinical studies concerning the impacts of Ramadan fasting on patients with NAFLD were included. RESULTS: In total, six studies with 397 NAFLD patients comprising five prospective studies and one retrospective study were included in the systematic review. All six studies were assessed as high-quality. Ramadan fasting may offer potential benefits for patients with NAFLD, including improvements in body weight, body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors, glucose profiles, liver parameters, and inflammation markers. CONCLUSION: Ramadan fasting might be an effective dietary intervention for NAFLD. However, the number of studies examining the impacts of Ramadan fasting for patients with NAFLD is relatively limited. Therefore, more high-quality research is needed to further our understanding of the benefits of Ramadan fasting for NAFLD. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://inplasy.com, identifier 202390102."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ramadan Iftar meal typically causes glucose excursions. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase glucagon-like peptide-1 and thus, decrease blood glucose levels with low risk of hypoglycemia. AIM: To investigate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin as an add-on therapy on glucose excursions of Iftar Ramadan meals among adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) treatment. METHODS: Fifty T1DM patients on MiniMed™ 780G AHCL were randomly assigned either to receive vildagliptin (50 mg tablet) with iftar meal during Ramadan month or not. All participants received pre-meal insulin bolus based on insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) for each meal constitution. RESULTS: Vildagliptin offered blunting of post-meal glucose surges (mean difference - 30.3 mg/dL [- 1.7 mmol/L] versus - 2.9 mg/dL [- 0.2 mmol/L] in control group; p < 0.001) together with concomitant exceptional euglycemia with time in range (TIR) significantly increased at end of Ramadan in intervention group from 77.8 ± 9.6% to 84.7 ± 8.3% (p = 0.016) and time above range (180-250 mg/dL) decreased from 13.6 ± 5.1% to 9.7 ± 3.6% (p = 0.003) without increasing hypoglycemia. A significant reduction was observed in automated daily correction boluses and total bolus dose by 23.9% and 16.3% (p = 0.015 and p < 0.023, respectively) with less aggressive ICR settings within intervention group at end of Ramadan. Coefficient of variation was improved from 37.0 ± 9.4% to 31.8 ± 7.1%; p = 0.035). No severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis were reported. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive vildagliptin treatment mitigated postprandial hyperglycemia compared with pre-meal bolus alone. Vildagliptin significantly increased TIR while reducing glycemic variability without compromising safety. Trial registration This trial was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no. NCT06021119."

This report aimed to describe the potential effects of Ramadan fasting on ECP treatment outcomes. Patients undergoing ECP were prospectively evaluated before and during the month of Ramadan 1443 AH (2022 AD) at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center (ADSCC), United Arab Emirates. The following ECP outcomes were assessed: treatment completion, adverse events reported, body mass index (BMI), and laboratory test results, including complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and other systemic immune-inflammatory biomarkers (SIIBs). No statistically significant differences were found in most of the variables analyzed in the three patients who underwent ECP before and during the holy month. Two non-fasting patients were not able to complete the Ramadan ECP schedule, and one fasting patient experienced a vascular access event during his first procedure in Ramadan. These findings suggest that fasting during Ramadan could add further risk factors and develop serious complications related to the ECP treatment. Therefore, we suggest that fasting should be avoided during photopheresis treatment, and we provided recommendations to achieve the best possible clinical outcomes."

Studying this can increase understanding of the effects of lifestyle changes on quality of life (QoL) for children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) during RF. METHODS: A cross-sectional study that assessed the effect of lockdown on lifestyle and QoL on fasting children living with T1D during Ramadan in the Middle East and North Africa region (2020-2021). We compared the child (self) and parent (proxy) reports using PEDQoL v3.0 disease specific questionnaire during lockdown and non-lockdown periods, and assessed correlations with lifestyle changes using regression and gap analyses. RESULTS: A total of 998 reports from 499 children with T1D aged 8 to 18 years (study = 276, control = 223), and their parents during RF in lockdown and non-lockdown periods. Fathers were more involved in their children's care during lockdown (P = .019). Patients had better compliance with treatment (P = .002), a reversed sleep pattern (P = .033), increased food intake (P ⩽ .001), and less exercise (P < .001). Children and parents perceived better QoL during lockdown (P ⩽.001) with no differences between their reports in \"Diabetes Symptoms\", \"Treatment Adherence,\" and \"Communication\" domains. Self and proxy reports were different in all domains during non-lockdown (P = <.001-.009). In gap analysis, although not statistically significant, the gap was approximated between children's and parents' perceptions in all domains during lockdown. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 lockdown had a positive impact on QoL of children living with T1D during RF, possibly due to lifestyle changes and superior psychosocial family dynamics."

Unfortunately, there is little information about glycemic control in these patients. This study aims to determine the fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels and to predict the risk factors for hypoglycemia in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and gestational DM (GDM) who fast during Ramadan. METHODS: A prospective cohort research was conducted at a single tertiary hospital between 2021 and 2023 on 70 pregnant women with GDM (n = 53) and type 2 DM (n = 17) in their second and third trimester. Their fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels during Ramadan were compared to those of the previous month, and hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose levels less than 60 mg/dl. Binary regression was used to predict the risk variables for hypoglycemia. RESULTS: The GDM and type 2 DM groups were similar in terms of age, parity, number of fasting days, and number of daily fasting hours. Only 26.9% of the women who were permitted to fast were given special instructions for Ramadan fasting. Dietary intervention was more common in the GDM group, whereas insulin and metformin treatment were more common in the type 2 DM group. The fasting glucose level decreased significantly after Ramadan fasting in both groups, from 92.5 (17.4) mg/dl to 90 (17.13) mg/dl (p = 0.033). However, there were a significantly higher number of hypoglycemia events in the type 2 DM group. Further, type 2 DM was identified as a risk factor for hypoglycemia (OR = 6.23; 95% CI = 1.04-37.54; P = 0.046. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that Ramadan fasting may improve fasting glucose control. In addition, type 2 DM was identified as a risk factor for hypoglycemia."

      "abstract": "An intermittent fasting regimen is widely perceived to lead to various beneficial health effects, including weight loss, the alleviation of insulin resistance, and the restructuring of a healthy gut microbiome. Because it shares certain commonalities with this dietary intervention, Ramadan fasting is sometimes misinterpreted as intermittent fasting, even though there are clear distinctions between these two regimens. The main purpose of this study is to verify whether Ramadan fasting drives the same beneficial effects as intermittent fasting by monitoring alterations in the gut microbiota. We conducted a study involving 20 Muslim individuals who were practicing Ramadan rituals and assessed the composition of their gut microbiomes during the 4-week period of Ramadan and the subsequent 8-week period post-Ramadan. Fecal microbiome analysis was conducted, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were assessed using liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry. The observed decrease in the levels of SCFAs and beneficial bacteria during Ramadan, along with the increased microbial diversity post-Ramadan, suggests that the daily diet during Ramadan may not provide adequate nutrients to maintain robust gut microbiota. Additionally, the notable disparities in the functional genes detected through the metagenomic analysis and the strong correlation between Lactobacillus and SCFAs provide further support for our hypothesis."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition caused by the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. Heartburn, chest discomfort, and regurgitation are the main symptoms. Medications, surgical procedures, and lifestyle modification are considered treatment options. Fasting is believed to be one of the lifestyle modifications that helps minimize GERD symptoms. Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, and smoking from dawn until dusk. The objectives of our study were to investigate the relationship between fasting and GERD symptoms and evaluate how fasting affects GERD symptoms in Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: This was a longitudinal study that selected GERD patients for its consecutive sampling. The patients answered the questionnaires at two separate times: once during Ramadan and once after Ramadan. A validated gastroesophageal reflux disease health-related quality of life (GERD-HRQL) self-administered survey was used. RESULT: After Ramadan, heartburn symptoms significantly decreased, particularly when lying down. Overall, the 45-point heartburn score decreased from 17.9 during Ramadan to 14.3 thereafter. The regurgitation score decreased from 12.3 during Ramadan to 9.9 after fasting, with statistical significance (P = .049). Although satisfaction was much higher after Ramadan (17% vs. 15.1%), there was no statistical significance (P = .422), and 45.3% of the patients were satisfied with their health state during Ramadan compared to 34% after Ramadan. There was no relationship between the severity of GERD symptoms before or after fasting and the type of food, the timing of eating, or the amount of food consumed. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that Ramadan fasting may improve GERD symptoms. However, more studies are required to validate these results and comprehend the underlying mechanisms."

METHODS: Participants received a flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system one week before Ramadan that was removed on the sixth or seventh day (pre- and early Ramadan periods) of Ramadan and a second FGM system one week before the end of Ramadan that was removed one week after the end of Ramadan (late and post-Ramadan periods). Fasting blood samples were collected during the pre-, early, and late Ramadan study visits and tested for HbA1c, serum creatinine, and plasma glucose levels. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were prospectively included. The standard deviation and coefficient of variation of glucose concentrations were higher in the early Ramadan period than in the pre-Ramadan period, but did not differ in the late or post-Ramadan periods. Changes in the early Ramadan period were restricted to males and patients aged <55 years. No significant changes were observed in the average glucose level, glucose management indicator, time in range, time in hyperglycemia, or time in hypoglycemia at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: Ramadan fasting in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes is associated with an initial increase in glucose variability that quickly returned to pre-Ramadan levels.

      "abstract": "Obesity is a significant driver of the global burden of non-communicable diseases. Fasting is one approach that has been shown to improve health outcomes. However, the effects of Ramadan fasting differ in that the type, frequency, quantity, and time of food consumption vary. This phenomenon requires in-depth evaluation considering that 90% of Muslims (~2 billion people) fast during Ramadan. To address this issue, we evaluated the pattern of weight change during and following Ramadan for a total of 52 weeks. The study was conducted in Amman, Jordan. Between 2012 and 2015, 913 participants were recruited as part of a trial investigating the efficacy of a weight loss intervention among those with or at risk for diabetes. Weight was measured weekly starting at the beginning of Ramadan, and changes were analyzed using discrete and spline models adjusted for age, sex, and trial group. Results show slight weight gain within the first two weeks and weight loss in the subsequent weeks. During the first week of Ramadan, the estimate for a weight increase was 0·427 kg, (95% CI: -0·007, 0·861) relative to baseline, compared to an estimated weight reduction of 0·55kg (95% CI: 0·05, 1·05) by the 8th week relative to baseline. There was clear evidence of gradual weight gain from week 8 until week 26 with an estimated weight gain of 2.547 kg (95% CI: 1.567, 3.527) at week 26 relative to baseline. A sharp drop of 2.66kg in weight was observed between the 26th and 28th week before it stabilized. Our results show that weight changes occurred during and after Ramadan. Weight fluctuations may affect health risks, and thus, findings from this study can inform interventions. Public health agencies could leverage this period of dietary change to sustain some of the benefits of fasting. The authors (DEZ, EFD) acknowledge the Mulago Foundation, the Horace W.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory conditions and oxidative stress increase in HIV infection, and inflammation increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Ramadan fasting is known to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. This study examined the effects of Ramadan fasting on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and total antioxidant status (TAOS) in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study comparing HIV-infected patients on stable ART who fasted throughout Ramadan to HIV-infected patients who did not fast during Ramadan. Inclusion criteria were men aged 20-40 years, taking first-line ART for at least 6 months, Muslims intent to fast for Ramadan, no current hospitalization because of acute conditions and not being treated for opportunistic infections. RESULTS: After 2 weeks, hs-CRP had decreased significantly in the fasting group (-0.41 mg/L [IQR = -1; 0.10]) compared to the non-fasting group (0.20 mg/L [IQR = -0.30; 1.50]) (p = 0.004). The linear regression analysis has shown that Ramadan fasting contributed to 10.10% of the variance in hs-CRP value (R 2 = 0.101) and decreased its value by 0.317 points (B = -0.317). Changes in TAOS did not significantly different (p = 0.405) between the fasting group (0.05 mmol/L [IQR = -0.03; 0.12]) and the non-fasting group (0.04 mmol/L [IQR = -0.13; 0.36]). In the fasting group, there were significant changes in polyunsaturated fatty acid consumption (p = 0.029), body weight (p = 0.001), cigarette smoking (p = 0.001), and sleeping duration (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Ramadan fasting reduces hs-CRP concentrations among HIV patients on ART."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam. Fasting is not meant to create excessive hardship on the Muslim individual according to religious tenets. It is important that health professionals are aware of potential risks associated with fasting during the month of Ramadan (mainly hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia). AIMS: To explore the impact of applying the principles of our 2020 recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) during the month of Ramadan. METHODS: A multinational randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in five Muslim majority countries. Six hundred and sixty participants were deemed eligible for the study; however, 23% declined to participate later for various reasons. In total, 506 participants were enroled and were equally randomized to the intervention or the control group. At the end of the study, data from 231 participants in the intervention group and 221 participants from the control group were collected after 12.6% and 8.7% were, respectively, lost to follow-up. Participants were randomized to receive a Ramadan-focussed education with treatment for diabetes adjusted as per our 2020 recommendation update compared with the local usual care (control group). Results are presented using mean, standard deviation, odds ratio (OR), and percentages. RESULTS: At the end of the study, the number of hypoglycemic episodes in the intervention group was less than in participants who received usual care. The intervention group had significantly lower severe hypoglycemia compared to the control group with an OR of 0.2 [0.1-0.8]. Compared to baseline, both groups had a significant reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), but the improvements were significantly greater in the intervention group. Whilst body weight reduced and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased with the intervention, these changes were not significantly different from usual care. CONCLUSIONS: A pre-Ramadan assessment of people with T2D coupled with pre-Ramadan education and an adjustment of glucose-lowering treatment as per our updated 2020 recommendations can prevent acute complications and allow a safer fast for people with T2D. We have shown that such an approach reduces the risk of developing severe hypoglycemia and improves the metabolic outcomes in people with T2D.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fasting during Ramadan is mandatory for all adult healthy Muslims. International studies found that most Muslims with diabetes mellitus fast during Ramadan. The main risk factors are hypoglycemia, Hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and dehydration during fasting. Therefore, stratification of the risks for severe acute diabetes complications needs to be considered for each individual and strategies personalized to advert these complications. The advent of new diabetes medications which are effective yet with a better safety profile and monitoring of blood glucose levels during the day are important to reduce the risk of untoward effects of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia during Ramadan fasting. Here we review the safety and effectiveness of the newer diabetes medications for Ramadan fasting and whether it is safe to perform fasting after bariatric surgery. METHODS: An extensive literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar was done using different search terms. The eligible studies were 48 randomized controlled trials, prospective observational studies, and reviews from January 2008 to June 2022 which were conducted in individuals living with diabetes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The newer diabetes medications such as GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and new Insulin therapy are thought to be safe and effective during fasting of Ramadan. These medications are associated with a reduction in HbA1c, body weight, systolic blood pressure and risk of hypoglycemia during Ramadan fasting. However, further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of these newer medications during Ramadan fasting. Individuals with Bariatric surgery should seek advice and approval to fast from the bariatric dietician, physician, and surgeon before the beginning of the month of Ramadan."

Hypoglycemic events are a serious complication associated with T1DM management during Ramadan fasting. AIM: This prospective study assessed the safety, effectiveness and optimization of advanced hybrid closed loop (AHCL) system on glycemic metrics and the level of hypoglycemia in T1DM patients who wished to fast Ramadan. METHODS: Forty-two T1DM patients (mean age 15.2 ± 3.4 years) using AHCL system were divided into two groups (each n = 21): intervention group who adjusted AHCL settings and control group who kept the same settings as before Ramadan. RESULTS: The most aggressive system settings among control group consisting of a 100 mg/dL glucose target, active insulin time of 2 h and bolus increment,maintained exceptional glycemia withtime in range reaching82.0 ± 10.2%, time above range >180 mg/dL of 12.1 ± 3.5% without an increase in hypoglycemia (time below range 3.0 ± 0.3%). All of which were non-significant in comparison to the intervention group. Overall time spent in closed loop (SmartGuard) by users averaged 98.7 ± 2.1% in Auto Mode and involved only 1.0 ± 0.7 exits per week indicating confidence in the system's performance. There were no severe hypoglycemic or diabetic ketoacidosis events during the study. CONCLUSIONS: MiniMed™ 780G AHCL system assist in safe fasting with minimal user input and allows for achievement of recommended glycemic targets in people with T1DM during Ramadan fasting. The system demonstrated reduction in hypoglycemia exposure without compromising safety.",

Fasting in Ramadan consists of intermittent fasting in which participating Muslims refrain from eating and drinking from dawn up to sunset. AIM: To validate the possible clinical consequences of Ramadan fasting for patients with psoriasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in Ramadan 2019. It included patients over 18 years who were diagnosed with stable chronic plaque psoriasis. PASI and BSA scores, body mass index and biochemical tests (including blood lipids, fasting blood glucose) were compared before and after a month of Ramadan fasting. RESULTS: The study included 121 psoriasis patients. The mean PASI score was 4.36 ±3.22 at the beginning of the study, which was reduced to 3.51 ±1.26 at the end of the study. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.001). There was no difference in the change of weight. We found a statistically significant difference in fasting plasma glucose, HDL and triglycerides. Only mild adverse events were noted during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Ramadan intermittent fasting has beneficial effects on severity of the disease in psoriasis patients with a reduction in PASI score and no serious health hazards. Thus, Ramadan intermittent fasting could be considered during treatment of psoriasis patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A strict lockdown was enforced during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in many countries including the UAE. Lockdown period overlapped with Ramadan which is accompanied by its own drastic changes in lifestyle that include meal timings. AIMS: We report the impact of COVID-19 lockdown (between 22/3/2020 and 24/6/2020) on glucose control pre- and postlockdown and during Ramadan, in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) on insulin therapy. METHODS: A number of twenty-four patients (19 men, 6 women) who were monitoring their glucose levels using flash glucose monitoring (FGM) and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic in Imperial College London Diabetes Centre (ICLDC), Abu Dhabi, UAE were included. Using the international consensus on the use of continuous glucose monitoring guidelines, analyses of data were performed on glucose management indicator (GMI), time in range (TIR), time in hyperglycemia, time in hypoglycemia, low blood glucose index (LBGI) and high blood glucose index (HBGI). Variables were calculated for each period: 30 days before lockdown 14/2/2020-14/3/2020, 30 days into lockdown and pre-Ramadan 20/3/2020-18/4/2020, and 30 days into lockdown and Ramadan 24/4/2020-23/5/2020, using cgmanalysis package in R-studio software. RESULTS: Mean average glucose (MAG) remained steady before and during lockdown, and no significant differences were observed in TIR, time in hypoglycemia, and LBGI between prelockdown and lockdown periods. However, there was a statistically significant difference in GMI and percentage of time in hyperglycemia (>10.0 mmol/L) between Ramadan and pre-Ramadan during the lockdown period in p = 0.007, 0.006, and 0.004, respectively. Percentage of TIR (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) was significantly lower in Ramadan as compared to pre-Ramadan (50.3% vs. 56.1%; p = 0.026). Mean absolute glucose (MAG) (182.0 mmol/L vs. 166.6 mmol/L, p = 0.007) and HBGI (10.2 (6.8, 14.8) vs. 11.9 (7.9, 17.8), p = 0.037) were significantly higher in Ramadan compared to pre-Ramadan period. There was no statistically significant difference in percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol/L) and LBGI between Ramadan and pre-Ramadan periods. CONCLUSION: The lockdown period had no significant effects in the markers of glycemic control in the population studied. However, Ramadan fasting period embedded within this time was associated with several changes that include increase in GMI, HBGI, and glycemic variability similar to what has been reported in other Ramadan studies."

Gliclazide is one of the SUs with the lowest risk of hypoglycemia; however, the safety and effectiveness of gliclazide MR during Ramadan has not yet been reported in Indonesia. This study aimed to assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of gliclazide modified release (MR) during Ramadan fasting. METHODS: The study was a part of DIA-RAMADAN study, a prospective observational study with subjects of T2DM patients aged >18 years, who had either controlled or sub-optimally controlled blood glucose level, performed Ramadan fasting. Subjects had been treated with gliclazide MR for at least 90 days prior the study, and were examined for their body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c levels 6 to 8 weeks before Ramadan (V0) and 4 to 6 weeks after the end of Ramadan (V1). RESULTS: Out of 198 subjects participating in the study, there were only two subjects (1.0%) who reported symptomatic HEs (either confirmed or not confirmed) and no severe HEs had been reported. There were no significant changes in HbA1c and FPG levels (p>0.05). Interestingly, there was a reduction of bodyweight (-0.4kg) from pre- to post-Ramadan (p < 0.001). Almost no subjects reported discontinuation of gliclazide MR throughout the entire study; however, there was one subject who reported a change of diabetic treatment into diet only. CONCLUSION: gliclazide MR is safe, well tolerated and can maintain glycemic control effectively for Indonesian patients with T2DM who perform Ramadan fasting.",

In this cross-sectional study, an Arabic-translated version of the standard diabetes-specific QoL questionnaire (PedsQL™ version 3.0) was used to compare perceptions of QoL during Ramadan month (Rm) versus non-Rm (NRm) of parents of children/adolescents with T1D from two tertiary hospitals in Riyadh. We used regression analysis to compare proxies (parents' reports) of their perceptions on their children/adolescents' QoL during Rm compared to NRm. A sample of 61 proxies (parents') of two age groups T1D offspring: 8-12 years (41%) and 13-18 years (59%) who reported their perceptions of their children/adolescents QoL during Rm were matched by children/adolescents' age and gender of 61 proxies in NRm. QoL scores of all domains were significantly lower in Rm compared to NRm; p < 0.0001, however, worries domain showed no statistical differences p = 0.052 in a regression analysis. The total aggregate median (IQR) in Rm was 850 (612-1,062) compared to 1,750 (1,475-2,062) in NRm, p < 0.001. The highest differences in NRm and Rm median scores were observed in communications (OR = 3.64; 95% CI 2.7-5.57) and treatment adherence (OR = 3.09; 95% CI 2.48-3.84) domains especially in the age of 13-18 years. Parents of adolescent boys, who are usually risk-takers and more exposed to outdoor activities, perceived lower QoL for them. Parents of adolescents with T1D perceived a lower QoL for their children during RF, especially in the treatment adherence and communication domains."

METHODS: This retrospective study included 153 Muslim patients with MS. Data related to the disease course before Ramadan were obtained from patients' files, whereas data related to the disease activity during Ramadan, were collected from patients over the two months following Ramadan. RESULTS: Patients with MS who experienced relapses, exacerbation of symptoms and development of new symptoms during Ramadan had a statistically significant longer disease duration compared to those who did not experience (P < 0.001, <0.001, 0.01 respectively). Also, patients who experienced relapses, exacerbation of symptoms and development of new symptoms during Ramadan had a statistically significant higher expanded disability status scale (EDSS) compared to those who did not experience (P <0.001, <0.001,0.01, respectively). The occurrence of relapses, exacerbation of symptoms and development of new symptoms during Ramadan, were significantly higher in patients who experienced relapses in the preceding year compared to those who did not (P= 0.002, 0.002, 0.01, respectively). Binary logistic regression revealed that each score elevation of EDSS increased the odds of relapse during Ramadan by 1.02 (P-value = 0.04). Also, each month's increase in disease duration increased the odds of relapse during Ramadan by 1.87 (P-value = 0.046). CONCLUSION: High EDSS and long disease duration are independent predictors of relapse during Ramadan."

The purpose of this observational study is to study the practice of fasting, in patients receiving external radiation therapy. METHODS: Our study was conducted during the month of Ramadan 1441 (2018) in the radiotherapy department of Ibn Rochd University Hospital of Casablanca. We included all patients who received external radiotherapy during this period. We thus collected the characteristics of patients, disease and treatment modalities. After an interview, with a pre-established questionnaire, we were able to establish the observance of the fast. RESULTS: We collected a total of 209 patients. The most frequently represented locations were breast cancer followed by gynecological cancers in 35.4% and 18.7% respectively. All our patients were fasting Ramadan before the diagnosis of cancer, however, only 39.2% were fasting during the treatment by radiotherapy, and just 40% of patients have discussed the possibility of fasting with their oncologist. In multivariate analysis, the stage of the disease was the only factor related to the fasting status of our patients. DISCUSSION: Even under treatment, many of our patients fast during the month of Ramadan. Further studies are needed to evaluate the tolerance of fasting in order to better answer the question \"can I fast?\".",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Ramadan is a holy month for the Muslim community. Fasting Ramadan is directed by a systematic alteration in eating habits, sleeping times, and daily physical activities that optimize blood glucose levels. This study aims to evaluate the effects of structured education on safe fasting among diabetic patients. METHODS: This study included diabetic patients with eligibility for the Ramadan fast. The control group included 494 patients who received standard diabetes education, while the intervention group included 407 patients who attained structured diabetes education. The patients were required to register their responses following the written, structured questionnaires before and after Ramadan fasts. In addition, patients were advised to keep a log of their hypoglycemic episodes. RESULT: This study showed that structured diabetes education improved the blood glucose levels/glycemic control and outcomes of patients during their Ramadan fasting. The structured diabetes education helped reduce the incidence of hypoglycemic events and hyperglycemic crises. It also increased the acceptance and frequency of blood sugar level measurements among patients during Ramadan. CONCLUSION: The standard diabetes management plan should include structured diabetes education measures to improve outcomes effectively. The providers should screen the patients with diabetes before Ramadan and educate them to improve their safe fasting practices.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the effect of Ramadan Fasting on Patients with Chronic Diseases and their experience during fasting. METHODS: This study was a descriptive research that used a researcher-designed questionnaire in face-to-face interviews with individuals who have at least one chronic disease and visit, for any reason, the Istanbul Sisli Etfal Training and Research Hospital polyclinics. We first asked each participant about fasting during Ramadan. If the participant was not fasting, we asked only the reason(s) and collected socio-demographic data. If a participant was fasting, we administered a researcher-designed questionnaire in face-to-face interviews. Our survey consisted of 19 questions that were designed to evaluate the fasting behaviors, current chronic disease and treatment status of individuals, encountered complications during fasting and their socio-demographic data. RESULTS: The study participants were 253 people (168 females [66.4%]; mean age: 58.06 ± 11,13) with non-infectious diseases. One hundred sixty (63.2%) participants were fasting during Ramadan and 33 of them (20.6%) had consulted a doctor before fasting, 62.5% (n = 100) said they never faced any symptoms during fasting. Most experienced symptom during fasting was fatigue (56.7%; n = 34). A significant relationship occurred between experiencing symptoms while fasting and gender (p = 0.023) and waking regularly for sahur (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Many people with chronic diseases fast and experience symptoms while fasting. Being woman and not waking up for sahur was related with the symptoms during Ramadan fasting. Most participants with NIDs fasted during Ramadan without consulting their doctors."

      "abstract": "The structure and diversity of human gut microbiota are directly related to diet, though less is known about the influences of ethnicity and diet-related behaviors, such as fasting (intermittent caloric restriction). In this study, we investigated whether fasting for Ramadan altered the microbiota in Chinese and Pakistani individuals. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and self-reported dietary intake surveys, we determined that both the microbiota and dietary composition were significantly different with little overlap between ethnic groups. Principal Coordinate Analyses (PCoA) comparison of samples collected from both groups before and after fasting showed partial separation of microbiota related to fasting in the Pakistani group, but not in the Chinese group. Measurement of alpha diversity showed that Ramadan fasting significantly altered the coverage and ACE indices among Chinese subjects, but otherwise incurred no changes among either group. Specifically, Prevotella and Faecalibacterium drove predominance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the Pakistani group, while Bacteroides (phylum Bacteroidetes) were the most prevalent among Chinese participants both before and after fasting. We observed significant enrichment of some specific taxa and depletion of others in individuals of both populations, suggesting that fasting could affect beta diversity. Notably, Dorea, Klebsiella, and Faecalibacterium were more abundant in the Chinese group after fasting, while Sutterella, Parabacteroides, and Alistipes were significantly enriched after fasting in the Pakistani group. Evaluation of the combined groups showed that genera Coprococcus, Clostridium_XlV, and Lachnospiracea were all significantly decreased after fasting. Analysis of food intake and macronutrient energy sources showed that fat-derived energy was positively associated with Oscillibacter and Prevotella, but negatively associated with Bacteroides. In addition, the consumption of sweets was significantly positively correlated with the prevalence of Akkermansia. Our study indicated that diet was the most significant influence on microbiota, and correlated with ethnic groups, while fasting led to enrichment of specific bacterial taxa in some individuals. Given the dearth of understanding about the impacts of fasting on microbiota, our results provide valuable inroads for future study aimed at novel, personalized, behavior-based treatments targeting specific gut microbes for prevention or treatment of digestive disorders."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The prevalence of obesity is increasing along with the number of sleeve gastrectomies. Patients' mental health and social life, along with their physical health, should be considered. Their cultural and religious values are an important part of treatment. Fasting is an important act of worship in all religions. Ramadan fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of Ramadan fasting on quality of life in patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data regarding the demographic characteristics, weight, the time elapsed after surgery, and the amount of liquid and solid food consumed during fasting were collected with two surveys, one of which was carried out at the beginning and the other at the end of Ramadan. In addition, the SF-36 health survey questionnaire was administered to evaluate the impact of Ramadan fasting on patients' quality of life. RESULTS: Fifty-one people participated in the first survey, but the second survey included 19 of them. While the median weight of the patients was 86.52 ± 17.78 kg before fasting, the median weight after 25 days of fasting was 83.31 ± 17.06 kg. A significant decrease was observed in weight after 25 days of fasting (p < 0.001). A comparison of the SF-36 scores for quality of life revealed a significant increase in the social functioning (p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Ramadan fasting caused significant weight loss in patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Besides, it did not adversely affect the quality of life, but rather increased social functioning.",

Chronic glucocorticoid replacement is the mainstay of treatment in the classic forms of CAH, and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy is mandatory in the salt-wasting form. Fasting is a mild stressor, which can expose to dehydration, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. CASE: We report the case of an adolescent affected by the classic form with salt-losing CAH, who observed Ramadan for 30 days, without individualized therapeutic management plan. After Ramadan, a dramatic increase of ACTH level (1081 pg/ml, n.v. 6-57), reduced cortisolemia, tendency to hypotension, and weight loss were recorded. She experienced insomnia, intense thirst, asthenia, and headache. The symptoms disappeared restarting the previous therapy schedule and increasing the total hydrocortisone daily dose with progressive restoring of hormonal control. CONCLUSION: Our case confirms that patients with CAH are vulnerable, especially during fasting in Ramadan, with a higher risk of acute adrenal crisis. CAH patients should reform and individualize their treatment plan and be submitted to careful monitoring."

Studies on the effects of fasting on the blood pressure of hypertensive patients are scarce and have provided inconclusive results. AIM: To examine the effect of fasting on ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate in treated hypertensive subjects. METHODS: The study prospectively recruited 60 hypertensive patients between April and June 2019, followed up at the cardiology department of Habib Thameur Hospital of Tunis. A 24-hour pressure monitoring was carried out during two periods: prior to Ramadan and during the last ten days of Ramadan. We compared the average values of 24 hour, awake and asleep systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 24 hour, awake and asleep heart rate. RESULTS: We studied 40 women and 20 men; mean age was 58.4 years. 33% of the patients were diabetics, 42% dyslipidemics, 15% had coronaropathy. 45% of the patients were on monotherapy, 37% on dual therapy and 18% on a triple antihypertensive therapy. During Ramadan, 74% of the patients were taking the treatment once daily, 3% twice daily, and 23% three times per day. Average 24hour ambulatory blood pressure in the whole group was 129±17/74±10 mmHg before Ramadan and 128±17/73±9 mmHg during Ramadan (p>0.05). Daytime and nighttime mean values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as mean values of heart rate were not different between both periods regardless of age, gender, medical history and lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there were no significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as heart rate during the 2 periods.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A narrative, non-systematic review of the international literature from two major online databases (viz. Scopus, PubMed) in one year (2019). The search term \"Ramadan fasting AND Diabetes\" was used, and relevant literature was narrated in a concise thematic account. RESULTS: Research design included qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Articles included controlled trials, critical appraisals, literature narrations, and systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. The publications spanned a vast array of topics related to Ramadan fasting, including assessments of current safety and efficacy profiles of newer diabetes therapies, modes of insulin delivery, and utilization of advanced technology for the treatment and monitoring of blood glucose during Ramadan fasting. Increased interest was particularly evident in capturing the experience element manifested by perceptions, attitudes, and practices of both patients and healthcare professionals during Ramadan. The current literature consolidates previous data on the safety of fasting practices amongst the well-controlled. On the other hand, it emphasizes the need for more aggressive interventions for high-risk patients, promoting the usage of newer anti-diabetic agents and advanced glucose monitoring technology for safer fasting practices. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of global literature production related to Ramadan fasting and Diabetes remains modest. Observational studies of small size prevail. Greater improvements in both quality and quantity of research on Ramadan are needed.",

      "abstract": "AIM(S): Ramadan fasting (RF) can represent various challenges to glycaemic control especially in insulin-treated patients with diabetes. We aimed to assess the effect of RF on several glucose metrics using flash glucose monitoring (FGM). METHODS: Complete FGM data for 29-30 days before, during and after Ramadan were available for 40 patients with type 1 (n = 13) and type 2 diabetes (n = 27) on insulin (with or without oral hypoglycaemic) treatment. Indicators of mean glucose, glucose variability (GV) and time in different glycaemic ranges were analysed. RESULTS: RF was associated with increase in time in hyperglycaemia (38.5 ± 18.2 vs 48.7 ± 20.7%; P < 0.001) and decrease in time in hypoglycaemia (3.2 ± 2.8 vs 2.1 ± 2.1%; P = 0.003), and time in target range (56.3 ± 17.2 vs 47.9 ± 19.7%, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in markers of GV with RF; however, RF was associated with a significant reduction in GV during the day but not night time with an increase in the ensuing non-fasting period. CONCLUSIONS: In insulin-treated patients, RF is associated with an increase in time in hyperglycaemia, a reduced time in target range and nocturnal increase in GV, indicating a need for more refined management algorithms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This work aimed to assess the safety of Ramadan Fasting following the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. METHODS: In our two centers' Prospective Cohort Study, We included 303 patients who had successful Percutaneous Coronary Intervention before the first day of Ramadan. We advised the patients that recent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention could be a valid excuse for not fulfilling Ramadan Fasting. However, many patients intended to fast the following Ramadan, and we included them in the fasting Group I. We added the patients who decided not to fast the following Ramadan as a control Group II. We followed all the patients during Ramadan and for 6 months after Ramadan. RESULTS: The demographic data of both groups and the complexity of the coronary anatomy showed no statistically significant difference. Group I (n = 153) showed a statistically significant difference in the incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events compared to Group II with a P value (0.005). The logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that the duration from index PCI till the start of RF, SYNTAX score > 22, and Complex procedure were independent predictors of Major Adverse Cardiac Events in the fasting Group I with {P = 0.001, OR (2.302), P = 0.026, OR (2.419), and P = 0.032 OR (1.952)}, respectively. Major Adverse Cardiac Events in Group I occurred mainly during Ramadan Fasting, with 19 patients having Major Adverse Cardiac Events during Ramadan and four patients during the remaining of the follow-up period. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis showed the decline of the incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events after 90 days from Percutaneous Coronary Intervention till the start of Ramadan Fasting with Sensitivity and specificity (90% and 65%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that low-risk patients with a normal systolic function who underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention may safely fast Ramadan. At the same time, Ramadan Fasting during the first 3 months following the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention may not be safe.",

The aim of our study was to assess the impact of fasting on glycémic control in diabetic patients prepared for fasting as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2010. We conducted a prospective cohort study in 2014, including diabetic patients wishing to fast during Ramadan, consenting to take part in this study. Were excluded patients considered at very high risk according to ADA classification. Patients included had a consultation before the month of Ramadan (D0) consisting of education and treatment adjustment. This was followed by a medical visit during Ramadan (J7), then at J30 and J60. Results analysis was done using SPSS Smartviewer15.0 Our study included 34 patients, of whom 60% were women, with a mean age of 50.4 years, an average 6.2-year diabetes history, and a mean body mass index of 27.83kg/m2. Therapeutic adjustments (D0) were: decrease dose of sulphonylurea (SH), gliptine add in patients at risk of hypoglycaemia, and a metformin dose distribution. During the first week (D7) two patients had a lower hypoglycemia 0.7g/l before breaking the fast and 38% of the sample showed hyperglycemia great than; 2g/l after breaking the fast. We noted dietary errors in 15% of patients. Adjusting at J7 was to modify the dose of SH or to add a gliptine. No patient showed major hyperglycemia, ketosis or severe hypoglycemia. One patient presented an atrial fibrillation on unknown ischemic cardiopathy with acease of fasting. Three patients gave up fasting between J15 and J20 due to an intense asthenia without hyperglycemia. Mean HbA1c in patients after the fasting was 7.10 versus 6.8% before fasting (p = 0.42). Factors significantly associated to poor glycemic control were mainly HbA1C rate at admission (p = 0.002), absence of self-monitoring (p = 0.01) and diabetes duration (p = 0.06). This study allowed us to show that a good evaluation of diabetic risk level, an education, a glycemia monitoring and an adjustment of the treatment by implementing international recommendations to allow fasting for Muslim diabetic patients with low risk of acute complications and metabolic disorders. A medical visit during the month of Ramadan (D7) would allow for correction of the dietetic mistakes and adjustment of oral agents if necessary.",

Patients were offered to take levothyroxine at 22.30-23.00 pm before sleep or between 01:30-03:00 am at least 30 min pre-seheri. RESULTS: There were 53 (85.5%) female and 9 (14.5%) male patients. Basal thyrotrophin (TSH) was 2.02 μIU/mL (0.27-4.14) and insignificantly increased at the end of Ramadan [2.18 μIU/mL (0.04-19.69), p=0.167]. Free-triiodothyronine (fT3) decreased while free-thyroxine (fT4) increased (p<0.001 for both). Eighteen patients preferred to take levothyroxine in late evening and 44 preferred to take at pre-seheri. There were insignificant increases in TSH in both groups (p=0.401 and p=0.276, respectively). At the end of Ramadan, TSH increased in 39 (63.9%), decreased in 22 (36.1%), and did not change in one patient. CONCLUSION: Increase in TSH was not significant after Ramadan. While there was an insignificant increase in median TSH, about one-third of patients had lower TSH, indicating for the need to evaluate every patient individually and follow closely during Ramadan. Clinical studies with larger sample sizes will be helpful to determine the optimal time for levothyroxine use during Ramadan.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Appropriate dose adjustments of glucocorticoids replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency (AI) is vital. OBJECTIVE: We sought to scope physicians' perceptions, and practices regarding Ramadan fasting (RF) impact on the management of AI. METHODS: A web-based survey of a convenience sample of endocrinologists. RESULTS: Nearly two-thirds of 145 respondents (64.1%) were adult endocrinologists and almost half (49%) saw more than 10 hypoadrenal patients per year. Most respondents (78.6%) prescribed hydrocortisone, while the minority prescribed other preparations. The glucocorticoid doses were reportedly divided twice daily by 70.8% and thrice daily by 22.2% of respondents. Respondents recognized RF as having potential consequences in adrenal insufficiency patients included causing hypoglycaemia, undue tiredness, and fatigue, hypotension, feeling dizzy, and light-headedness. Symptoms of under-replacement were thought to happen in the late afternoon by 59.3% of respondents. Almost half (45.5%) of respondents thought that RF has some probable or definite impact on glucocorticoid therapy that certainly warrants specific concern and possible action. Three quarters (76.4%) of respondents confirmed providing specific management recommendations during RF. The most frequently reported recommendation was taking in the usual morning dose of hydrocortisone just before pre-dawn meal (Suhor) (57.8%). A third switch patients from hydrocortisone to prednisolone/prednisone. Half reported providing patients with specific recommendations regarding breaking their fast and/or seeking help if hypoadrenal symptoms occur. CONCLUSIONS: There is a remarkable variation in the physicians' perceptions and practices regarding the management of AI during Ramadan. This warrants professional effort to increase the awareness and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines."

      "abstract": "Ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar, is a period of intermittent fasting alternated with moments of refeeding. The last decades have seen a growing number of reports that examine the potential effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on chronic musculoskeletal disorders. In this paper, we reviewed data that assessed the relationship of intermittent diurnal fasting during Ramadan with rheumatic diseases. Currently, recent evidence indicates that RIF may attenuate the inflammatory state by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and reducing the body fat and the circulating levels of leukocytes. Therefore, it may be a promising non-pharmacological approach for managing the course of rheumatic inflammatory diseases. Despite differences between studies in daily fasting duration and dietary norms, there appears to be a consensus that most of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA) who fasted Ramadan experienced relief of their symptoms. Nevertheless, further clinical trials are required to assess the effect of RIF on other musculoskeletal and bone disorders. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of RIF on chronic medication intake. Even if a few studies on this issue are available, the primary outcomes indicate that RIF does not significantly impair either compliance or tolerance to chronic medications. These findings may give some reassurance to patients with a specific fear of drug intake during this month. Key Points • Intermittent diurnal fasting during Ramadan can modulate the inflammatory status through the down-regulation of metabolic syndrome, the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the reduction of circulating levels of leukocytes • Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) can effectively improve the activity of rheumatic inflammatory diseases. • Although further studies are still required, there seems no harm for patients with gout to participate in RIF. • Primary outcomes indicate that RIF may be a promising non-pharmacological intervention for the management of patients with osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.",

We aimed to determine patient-guided modifications of OAC medication regimen during Ramadan and to evaluate its consequences. A multicenter cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected shortly after Ramadan 2019. Participants were patients who fasted Ramadan and who were on long-term anticoagulation. Patient-guided medication changes during Ramadan in comparison to the regular intake schedule before Ramadan were recorded. Modification behavior was compared between twice daily (BID) and once daily (QD) treatment regimens. Rates of hospital admission during Ramadan were determined. We included 808 patients. During Ramadan, 53.1% modified their intake schedule (31.1% adjusted intake time, 13.2% skipped intakes, 2.2% took double dosing). A higher frequency of patient-guided modification was observed in patients on BID regimen compared to QD regimen. During Ramadan, 11.3% of patients were admitted to hospital. Patient-guided modification was a strong predictor for hospital admission. Patient-guided modification of OAC intake during Ramadan is common, particularly in patients on BID regimen. It increases the risk of hospital admission during Ramadan. Planning of OAC intake during Ramadan and patient education on the risk of low adherence are advisable.",

We speculate the fasts observed during the month of Ramadan to be unintentional intermittent fasts, which may have health benefits. OBJECTIVE: The study was attempted to know the alterations in biomarkers viz. body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), serum glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) due to Ramadan IF on type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients of western India. METHODS: A total 50 patients of T2D were selected for above-mentioned biomarkers assessment immediately before the starting of fast followed by after 45 days. RESULTS: The present results indicated the beneficial impact on intermittent fasting among patients (baseline versus followed up) by detecting the alterations of above-mentioned biomarkers. In overall results (n=50), the BW (Kg) and BMI (Kg/m2) values were significantly (P<0.001) decreased in followed-up patients (76.06 ± 15.41 and 27.45 ± 5.06) when compared to baseline value (77.26 ± 15.53 and 27.90 ± 5.11) while the level of HbA1c (mmol/mol) was also significantly (P<0.05) decreased in followed-up patients (7.62 ± 0.99) when compared to baseline value (7.90 ± 1.24). But no significant changes in the values of SBP and DBP were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this observational study revealed the reduction of body weight, BMI and serum HbA1c levels probably due to IF for the T2D patients during the holy month of Ramadan. Moreover, the IF can be utilized as a therapy along with other pharmacological therapies. It is suggested future research work with other important biomarkers, which can be easier for T2D therapy.",

Ramadan fasting as a type of intermittent fasting is a non-pharmacological intervention refining the overall health. This year, Ramadan is coincided with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak making it one of the most challenging fasting periods for Muslims in the world. There is no solid direct evidence to suggest any adverse effect of Ramadan fasting during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthy individuals. However, there are exemptions in Ramadan Fasting and those at risk of health issues should not fast. COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited studies concerning its risk factors.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1008 type 2 Diabetes patients were offered a culturally-based PREP in addition to the standard of care, two months before Ramadan. A retrospective interview one month after Ramadan compared the fasting experience of PREP attendees (470 patients) with those who merely received standard of care (538 patients) (Non-PREP). RESULTS: Ramadan fasting improved glycemic control with a correlation between HbA1c percent reduction and the number of fasting days (r = -0.290, p = 0.007). More HbA1c and weight percent reduction were observed in PREP attendees compared to the Non-PREP group (-14.8% ± 9.3 vs. -5.4% ± 5.4; p < 0.001; and - 1.96% ± 5.4 vs. -0.39% ± 2.8; p < 0.001, respectively). More commitment to night prayers in the PREP attendees compared to the Non-PREP group, (85.5% prayed >20 nights vs 28.4%; p < 0.001) with more HbA1c and weight percent reduction in the those who performed the prayers more than 20 nights compared to those who performed no prayers (-11.69% ± 8.8 vs -6.28% ± 6.4, p < 0.001; and - 2.76% ±5.1 vs 1.35% ±1.8, p < 0.001, respectively). More perception of true hypoglycemia was associated with PREP attendance (p0.046), insulin treatment (p0.000), and reduction of antidiabetic medication dosage (p0.004). Repeated lowering of antidiabetic medications doses with sequential downsizing of meals' portions, and appetite was reported. CONCLUSION: Ramadan fasting was beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes with reduction of HbA1c in correlation with the number of fasting days. Contrasting PREP with Non-PREP participants discovered better HbA1c and weight reduction in the former group even with equal number of fasting days. PREP participants performed more Taraweeh night prayers. The more the prayer nights the more decline of HbA1c and weight was observed. PREP improved perception and response to hypoglycemia with low-dosing of antidiabetic medications, especially insulin."

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of long Ramadan fasting on BP with ambulatory BP monitoring in hypertensive patients using diuretics. METHODS: This prospective, observational study was done on 129 hypertensive patients and was carried out in two groups: 73 treated hypertensive patients were assigned to the diuretic group and 56 treated hypertensive patients were allocated to the non-diuretic group. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was performed during and after Ramadan. Mean overall, daytime and nighttime BP were measured and compared in both groups. The differences in mean SBP and DBP were recorded between the two monitoring periods. RESULTS: In diuretic group, 24-h SBP decreased from 128.2 ± 17.9 to 119.3 ± 9.5 mmHg during Ramadan (8.9 units; P < 0.001). DBP decreased from 79.4 ± 10.9 to 75.3 ± 7.6 mmHg (4.1 units; P < 0.001). On the other hand, SBP and DBP were lower insignificantly in the non-diuretic group. The reduction in SBP was significantly higher in the diuretic group (overall: P = 0.005, daytime: P = 0.011, nighttime: P = 0.022). Thiazide-like diuretics lowered BP more than thiazide-type diuretic despite an insignificant difference. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that Ramadan fasting might cause significant reductions in mean SBP and DBP measurements in patients using diuretics. Despite decreasing in BP, diuretics generally well tolerated and can be safe in well-controlled hypertensive patients during Ramadan fasting.",

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the relationship between RF and glycaemic parameters in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. METHODS: Search terms were decided and databases such as MEDLINE EBSCO, Google Scholar and EMBASE were searched for eligible studies. Standardized mean differences and 95 per cent confidence intervals (CIs) of post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (%) and fructosamine levels were calculated for different treatment regimens. RESULTS: Of the 40 studies, 19 were found eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Based on pooled results, significant reductions in FPG were found in single oral antidiabetics (OAD) [standardized weighted mean difference (SMD)=0.47, 95% CI=(0.20-0.74)], multi-OAD [SMD=0.36, 95% CI=(0.11-0.61)] and multitreatment subgroups [SMD=0.65, 95% CI=(0.03-1.27)] and overall [SMD=0.48, 95% CI=(0.27-0.70)]. Furthermore, HbA1c(%) [SMD=0.26, 95% CI=(0.03-0.49)] and body mass index (BMI) [SMD=0.18, 95% CI=(0.04-0.31)] were significantly decreased in the multi-OAD group.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The risks of hypoglycemia, dehydration and kidney injury may theoretically be aggravated by people with type 2 diabetes treated with Insulin and SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan. Data on safety and efficacy of SGLT2-I in people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin is scanty. We aimed to assess the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, on hypoglycemia, glycemic control and kidney function. METHODS: This is a prospective interventional study on high-risk diabetes patients who insisted on fasting. All patients were treated with insulin ± SGLT2I. All patients received a FGMS and Ramadan focused education. All patients attended clinic before and post Ramadan where they were advised on treatment modification as well as biometric and biochemical measurements. RESULTS: 95 patients enrolled in the study and 49 of them were on SGLT2i. There was a no significant change in creatinine in both groups. FGMS showed an improvement in the sensor-calculated HbA1c from 7.3 ± 1.5 to 6.8 ± 1.1 and from 8 ± 1.6 to 7.7 ± 1.5 in the SGLT2 group and the non-SGT2i groups, respectively. The hypoglycemia was predominantly reported during Ramadan between 12:00 to 18:00 h, while in pre-Ramadan readings was during 2400-0600 and 1200-1800 slots. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that assesses the use of SGLT2i along with insulin during Ramadan, using FGMS in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes under optimal care. There was minimal interruption of fasting, significant improvement in glycemic control, and no significant change in the kidney function after Ramadan.",

      "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic-relapsing and debilitating disease, which affects the components of the folliculopilosebaceous unit and severely impacts on the perceived health-related quality of life. Among the possible treatments, dietary interventions, such as fasting, have been described to positively impact on HS. However, nothing is known about the effects of circadian, intermittent fasting, such as the Ramadan fasting. A sample of 55 HS patients (24 males (43.6%) and 31 females (56.4%), mean age 39.65 ± 8.39 years, average disease duration 14.31 ± 7.03 years) was recruited in the present study. The \"Severity of International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System\" (IHS4) decreased significantly from 11.00 ± 5.88 (before Ramadan) to 10.15 ± 6.45 (after Ramadan), with a mean difference of -0.85 ± 0.83 (p < 0.0001). At the univariate analyses, the improvement was associated with HS phenotype (with a prominent improvement among those with ectopic type), treatment (with the improvement being higher in patients receiving topical and systemic antibiotics compared to those treated with biologics), the \"Autoinflammatory Disease Damage Index\" (ADDI), and Hurley scores. At the multivariate regression analysis, only the Hurley score (regression coefficient = 0.70, p = 0.0003) was found to be an independent predictor of change in the IHS4 score after fasting. The improvement in the IHS4 score was not, however, associated with weight loss. In conclusion, the Ramadan fasting proved to be safe and effective in HS patients. Considering the small sample size and the exploratory nature of the present investigation, further studies in the field are warranted, especially longitudinal, prospective and randomized ones.",

We aimed to follow the variation of some biochemical and clinical parameters in T2D patients before and after Ramadan; and to determine the incidence of fasting on hypoglycaemia and lactic acidosis associated with antidiabetic agents such as metformin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work is a prospective study conducted during Ramadan on 150 patients, recruited 2 to 3 weeks prior to the start. These patients were sensitized about the Ramadan lifestyle and diet as well as the medications to take. RESULTS: This study results indicated a significant decrease of glycated haemoglobin (from 8.06% to 7.42%) and a similar trend in the fasting plasma glucose (from 1.81 to 1.36g/L) before and after Ramadan respectively. The serum lipid profile showed significant variations during the study period, and antidiabetic medications was associated with low serum lactate. The plasma creatinine and uric acid were reduced but remained insignificant. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Based on data from our study, we concluded that a safe fasting with a lower risk hypoglycaemia, can be achieved in a well-controlled patients, under antidiabetic drugs. However, the diabetes medication was associated with a small increase in serum lactate levels that seemed to be dose-independent and not affected by treatment duration.",

      "abstract": "Fasting during the month of Ramadan and other religious fasting days presents a challenging issue for healthcare practitioners (HCP). Education and instructions for patients with diabetes who intend to fast is mandatory during the pre-Ramadan period. This period represents a golden opportunity to evaluate the general health status of the patients including their risk associated with fasting. Furthermore, it allows HCP to revise and adapt suitable changes for their anti- diabetic therapy before initiating fasting. Therapy with high safety profile agents such as incretin-based therapy is more favorable than therapy with moderate-low safety profile agents such as sulphonylureas(SUs) and insulin to be administrated during the month of Ramadan. Patients already receiving treatment with sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) need thorough medical evaluation during the pre-Ramadan period in order to enable them to fast safely during the month of Ramadan using this class of agents. The aim of this review is to provide HCP in Israel with instructions and recommendations for better management of diabetic patients during Ramadan, while taking into consideration the recently published data and therapies available in Israel.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent circadian fasting, namely Ramadan, is a common worldwide practice. Such fasting has a positive impact on psoriasis, but no data exist on its role in psoriatic arthritis (PsA)-a disease that is clearly linked to body mass index. We enrolled 37 patients (23 females and 14 males) with a mean age 43.32 ± 7.81 and they fasted for 17 h for one month in 2016. The baseline PsA characteristics were collected and 12 (32.4%) patients had peripheral arthritis, 13 (35.1%) had axial involvement, 24 (64.9%) had enthesitis, and 13 (35.1%) had dactylitis. Three patients (8.1%) were treated with methotrexate, 28 (75.7%) with TNF-α blockers, and 6 (16.2%) with IL-17 blockers. After a month of intermittent fasting, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased from 14.08 ± 4.65 to 12.16 ± 4.46 (p < 0.0001), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) decreased from 2.83 ± 1.03 to 2.08 ± 0.67 (p = 0.0078), Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) decreased from 7.46 ± 2.43 to 5.86 ± 2.37 (p < 0.0001), and Disease Activity index for PSoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) decreased from 28.11 ± 4.51 to 25.76 ± 4.48 (p < 0.0001). Similarly, enthesitis improved after fasting, with Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) decreasing from 2.25 ± 1.11 to 1.71 ± 0.86 (p < 0.0001) and dactylitis severity score (DSS) decreasing from 9.92 ± 2.93 to 8.54 ± 2.79 (p = 0.0001). Fasting was found to be a predictor of a decrease in PsA disease activity scores (DAPSA, BASDAI, LEI, DSS) even after adjustment for weight loss. IL-17 therapy was found to be an independent predictor of decreases in LEI after fasting. These preliminary data may support the use of chronomedicine in the context of rheumatic diseases, namely PsA. Further studies are needed to support our findings.",

METHODS: A cross-sectional multi-country observational study, with data captured within 6 weeks after Ramadan 2015. Patients' and disease characteristics and its management, the risk of hypoglycaemia and patients' response to hypoglycaemia were recorded. RESULTS: A cohort of 1759 patients; majority with type 2 diabetes mellitus from North Africa, Arabian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and the Indian subcontinent. Hypoglycaemia was reported by 290 patients (16.8%); particularly affecting type 1 diabetes patients and in insulin-treated patients in general. Age was significantly younger in the hypoglycaemia group (P < 0.001). The commonest responses were reducing the dose or frequency of medications (42%), attending primary care providers (24.5%) or increasing monitoring (20.7%). Fasting was interrupted by 67% only of those who experienced hypoglycaemia and recourse to emergency services was pursued by less than a quarter of patients with hypoglycaemia. The country-wise analysis of the rates of hypoglycaemia was greatest in Egypt (51.3%) and lowest in Pakistan (3.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Hypoglycaemia is a significant complication of fasting during Ramadan. It may be predicted by type of diabetes, and use of insulin. Patients' responses are varied and call for more formal pre-Ramadan education.",

      "abstract": "Fasting during the month of Ramadan consists of alternate abstinence and re-feeding periods (circadian or intermittent fasting). Nothing is currently known on the impact of this kind of fasting on psoriasis. A sample of 108 moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients (aged 42.84 ± 13.61 years, 62 males, 46 females) volunteered to take part in the study. A significant decrease in the \"Psoriasis Area and Severity Index\" (PASI) score after the Ramadan fasting (mean difference = -0.89 ± 1.21, p < 0.0001) was found. At the multivariate regression, the use of cyclosporine (p = 0.0003), interleukin-17 or IL-17 blockers (p < 0.0001), and tumor necrosis factor or TNF blockers (p = 0.0107) was independently associated with a low PASI score, while the use of apremilast (p = 0.0009), and phototherapy (p = 0.0015) was associated with a high PASI score before the Ramadan fasting. Similarly, the consumption of cyclosporine (p < 0.0001), IL-17 blockers (p < 0.0001), mammalian target of rapamycin or mTOR inhibitors (p = 0.0081), and TNF blockers (p = 0.0017) predicted a low PASI score after the Ramadan fasting. By contrast, narrow band ultraviolet light B or NB-UVB (p = 0.0015) was associated with a high PASI score after Ramadan fasting. Disease duration (p = 0.0078), use of apremilast (p = 0.0005), and of mTOR inhibitors (p = 0.0034) were independent predictors of the reduction in the PASI score after the Ramadan fasting.

This study explores the effect of Ramadan fasting on the blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, sleeping quality, and essential lifestyle parameters and also explores the safety of fasting for a whole month among diabetic patients. AIM: The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of Ramadan fasting on the blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, sleeping quality, and lifestyle parameters among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Turkey. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 1780 diabetic patients were approached, and 1246 (70%) participated in this cross-sectional study carried out during the period from May 27, 2017, to June 24, 2017. Data analysis comprised sociodemographic features, lifestyle habits, blood pressure measurements, serum lipid profiles, serum calcium, Vitamin D 25-hydroxy, uric acid, and HbA1c at before 4 weeks and after 12 weeks from Ramadan. RESULTS: Out of 1246 patients, 593 (47.6%) were male and 653 (52.4%) were female. The mean ± standard deviation age of the patients was 50.39 ± 15.3 years. Males were significantly older than females (51.53 ± 12.56 vs. 49.26 ± 14.4; P = 0.003, respectively). Significant differences were found in Vitamin D, blood glucose, HbA1c level, creatinine, bilirubin, albumin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (female), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (male), uric acid, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure after and before the holy month of Ramadan (P < 0.05 for each). HbA1c (P < 0.001), physical activity (P < 0.001), hours of sleeping (P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (BP) (mmHg) (P = 0.007), BMI (P = 0.016), diastolic BP (mmHg) (P = 0.018), family history (P = 0.021), and smoking (P = 0.045) were identified as significantly associated with Ramadan fasting as contributing factors. CONCLUSION: In one of the largest studies of its kind, we show that Ramadan fasting has positive effects on T2DM patients as it reduces their blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1C, and BMI. Furthermore, there are improvements in the duration of sleep and physical activity, the role of Ramadan fasting in diabetes therapy has been confirmed.",

METHODS: This is a single-centre prospective observational controlled cohort study. Muslim patients aged 21-75 years with type 2 diabetes and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 were eligible if they had no contraindication to observe Ramadan fasting. Patients in study group were on stable dose of SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before enrolment and continued during study period, while patients in control group were not on SGLT2 inhibitor before and during study period. All participants attended baseline visit before Ramadan and follow-up visit during Ramadan. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients of similar baseline characteristics were included in the study: 35 in study group and 33 in control group. During Ramadan fasting, patients from study and control group had similar change in weight (LS mean change of -1.8 versus -1.1 kg, p = 0.205), eGFR (LS mean change of -6.0 versus -4.2 ml/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.399), sitting systolic BP (LS mean change of -8.1 versus -10.4 mmHg, p = 0.569), sitting diastolic BP (LS mean change of -3.7 versus -3.5 mmHg, p = 0.934) and plasma β-hydroxybutyrate level (LS mean change of -0.01 versus -0.02 mmol/L, p = 0.649). CONCLUSIONS: Ramadan fasting was associated with significant changes in weight, BP and eGFR regardless whether patients were on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. Continued use of SGLT2 Inhibitors during Ramadan did not increase ketonemia, nor increase risk of eGFR deterioration and hypoglycaemia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPTII) deficiency is a mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorder that can present antenatally as congenital brain malformations, or postnatally with lethal neonatal, severe infantile, or the most common adult myopathic forms. No case of severe hyperammonemia without liver dysfunction has been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We described a 23-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with seizures and was found to have markedly elevation of serum ammonia. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated with successfully decreased ammonia to a safety level. He had a prolonged history of epilepsies and encephalopathic attacks that was associated with high ammonia level. Molecular diagnosis revealed a homozygous mutation in CPTII. The plasma acylcarnitine profile was consistent with the diagnosis. Failure to produce acetyl-CoA, the precursor of urea cycle from fatty acid in prolonged fasting state in Ramadan month, worsening mitochondrial functions from circulating long chain fatty acid and valproate toxicities were believed to contribute to this critical metabolic decompensation. CONCLUSION: Fatty acid oxidation disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hyperammonemia even without liver dysfunction. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CPTII deficiency presented with severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy required dialysis after prolonged religious related fasting."

Furthermore, fasting, which practiced during the month of ramadan, can have an impact on drug's metabolism. These two factors, fasting and eating habits changes during the month of ramadan, may impact acenocoumarol anticoagulant effect, translated by variations of INR values. The aim of our study was to see ramadan fasting effects on INR variations in patients treated by acenocoumarol. A prospective monocentric study was conducted during the ramadan month on fasting outpatients that were treated by acenocoumarol. Baseline INR values (e.i. most recent available value before the month of ramadan) were compared to INR values obtained during the month of ramadan. All patients were monitored for signs of secondary haemorrhagic complications linked to treatment by anti-vitamin K (AVK). Thirty patients were included in the study with a sex ratio 1. Patients mean age was 65 years. Around two thirds of the patients were treated by AVK for atrial fibrillation. The majority of patients (94%) have been treated by AVK for more than a year. Mean INR was significantly higher during the month of ramadan than baseline (3.51 vs 2.52; p< 0.0001). There were also more overdoses during the month of ramadan than baseline (9 vs. 0; p=0.014). The increased INR values highlights the need of a close monitoring of INR values during the month of ramadan, particularly in patients with a high haemorrhagic risk.",

Pre Ramadan period is crucial for evaluating and preparing patients with diabetes intending to Fast Ramadan. The risk stratification categories should take into consideration patients with diabetes having specific conditions such as nephrotic syndrome who are predisposed to thrombosis independent to their estimated glomerular filtration rate and glycated haemoglobin. Furthermore, population-specific conditions such as nomadic Bedouins living in remote areas should be considered as part of the very high risk category for fasting Ramadan. Published data regarding the use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors during Ramadan is very limited. Dapagliflozin was the only agent studied during Ramadan. Therefore, it is suggested to categorize this group of agents differently from other agents such as metformin and incretin based therapy studied vastly during Ramadan.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of Ramadan fasting on ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, observational study was carried out in two groups: one group included hypertensive patients treated with two antihypertensive agents (n=6) and the other group included healthy individuals (n=12). We performed 24-h blood pressure monitoring at four time points: before Ramadan, during the first and last 10 days of Ramadan, and 1 month after Ramadan. All hypertensive patients followed their twice-daily treatment regimen. Mean 24-h blood pressure (as well as mean blood pressure values during awake and sleep periods), body weight, and waist circumference were measured in the two groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the trends of systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the hypertensive and nonhypertensive groups during Ramadan and 1 month after it. However, the trends of variations in heart rate and body weight were not significantly different in the two groups (P<0.001 and P=0.016, respectively). There was a significant increase in heart rate during the first period of Ramadan in hypertensive patients (P=0.018), whereas it improved during the post-Ramadan period in comparison with the second period of measurements (P=0.019). Furthermore, there was a significant decline in heart rate during the post-Ramadan measurement compared with that before Ramadan in the nonhypertensive group (P=0.008).In addition, there was a significant weight gain in the third period in comparison with the previous period in the hypertensive group (73.1±11 vs. 72.2±12; P=0.011). CONCLUSION: This finding indicates that Ramadan fasting might be nonthreatening for patients with essential hypertension if the treatment regimen is complied with.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fasting Ramadan carries a high risk for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Data on the optimum insulin regimen in these patients are limited. OBJECTIVES: To compare glucose profiles in patients with T1DM who use continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with those who use multiple daily injections (MDI) insulin regimen during Ramadan fast. The primary outcome was rates of hypoglycemia. Other outcomes included glycemic control, number of days needed to break fasting, and acute glycemic complications. METHODS: Patients with T1DM who were on CSII or MDI and decided to fast Ramadan were recruited. Glucose data collected using self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were compared in the two groups, CSII and MDI, and glucose control was assessed by measuring serum fructosamine levels. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were recruited, 61 on CSII and 95 on MDI. There was no difference in the rate of mild hypoglycemia <4.4 mmol/L (<80 mg/dL) (8.6% ± 6.1% in the CSII group and 9.85% ± 9.34% in the MDI group, P = 0.96). The mean rate of severe hypoglycemia <2.7 mmol/L (<50 mg/dL) was also not different in both groups (0.99% ± 1.7% in the CSII group compared to 1.7% ± 4.7% in the MDI group, P = 0.23). There was no difference in glycemic control as measured by fructosamine levels or the number of days that patients have to stop fasting. Glucose variability was significantly better in CSII group (SMBG; standard deviation [SD] 66.9 ± 15.3 vs. 76.9 ± 29.9, P = 0.02) (CGM; SD 68.1 ± 19.6 vs. 78.7 ± 24.9, P = 0.04). No diabetic ketoacidosis was reported in either group. CONCLUSION: In patients with T1DM who fast Ramadan, there was no difference in rates of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia between CSII and MDI. However, CSII was associated with less glucose variability.",

The effects of religious fasting during Ramadan month (in the Islamic calendar) on anticoagulation aren't clear. OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of Ramadan fasting on international normalized ratio (INR), quality of anticoagulation, dose of warfarin used and blood osmolarity. METHODS: 18 patients were followed-up prospectively for 3 months (pre- Ramadan, Ramadan and post-Ramadan months). Patients presented for weekly visits in which blood samples were obtained. RESULTS: No significant difference in INR and warfarin dose was found between Ramadan month, and months before and after it. The post-Ramadan INR was significantly larger than pre-Ramadan (p = 0.004). Blood osmolarity was significantly lower during Ramadan compared to pre- and post-Ramadan months. A significantly better quality of anticoagulation was noticed during Ramadan (p < 0.001). A significantly larger ratio of supratherapeutic INR values occurred in the post-Ramadan month (p < 0.05). A significantly larger ratio of infra-therapeutic INR values was noticed in the pre-Ramadan month (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: No significant difference in mean INR or warfarin dose was found and a better quality of anticoagulation was achieved during Ramadan. A tendency toward supra-therapeutic anticoagulation occurred after Ramadan, thus a closer follow up during this period may be reasonable."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Medical treatment has been widely used in peptic ulcer disease, however perforation is a severe complication. The rationale of this study was to evaluate the effect of Islamic Ramadan fasting on peptic ulcer perforation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (No. 2311) who were operated on due to peptic ulcer perforation in a teaching and reference Hospital of a State University from January 1979 to January 2016 were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups. Group I (No. 1805) included patients who were operated during other periods of the years without Ramadan fasting (396 months), while Group II (No. 506) constituted of patients who were operated on during the fasting periods (36 months). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean ages between the groups (38 vs. 42 years). The mean monthly number of surgical intervention rates was higher in Group II (14.05 vs. 4.55, p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant rise in the number of male patients during Ramadan months (p = 0.0073). While omentoplasty with upper midline laparotomy vs. other surgical methods was significantly more employed in Group II (p = 0.0024), mortality rates were similar as 2.27 and 2.56% in Group I and II, respectively (p > 0.05). We could not detect any seasonal differences, although hot summer days constituted the longest fasting durations (19 hours) in the country. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the occurrence of peptic ulcer perforation was significantly high during Ramadan fasting months due to the long fasting periods especially with significant male predominance.",

The aims of this study were to evaluate these risks in such patients, to determine the risk factors and finally to set some recommendations. METHODS: It is a cross-sectional study about 180 patients with known and treated adrenal insufficiency. The patients responded to a 14-item questionnaire concerning their knowledge about the disease and fasting during the last month of Ramadan. RESULTS: There were 132 women and 48 men. The mean age was 47.6 ± 15.0 years (14-79). One hundred and thirty eight patients (76.7 %) were advised by their physician not to fast. Ninety-one patients (50.5 %) tried to fast. Complications occurred in 61 cases (67.0 %): asthenia in 88.5 % of cases, intense thirst in 32.8 %, symptoms of dehydration in 49.2 % and symptoms of hypoglycaemia in 18 %. One patient was hospitalized. Fifty-five patients (60.4 %) were able to fast for the whole month. Age, gender, duration of the disease, its primary origin, associated hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension or diabetes insipidus and daily dose of hydrocortisone did not significantly differ between fasters and non-fasters, full-month-fasters and partial-month-fasters, and fasters with complications and fasters without complications. The frequency of adequate knowledge about the disease was significantly higher in full-month-fasters vs. partial-month-fasters, and in fasters without complications vs. those with complications. CONCLUSION: In patients with adrenal insufficiency, fasting can cause complications especially if the level of knowledge about the disease is low.",

      "abstract": "Hypoglycemia is the most common side effects for most glucose-lowering therapies. It constitutes a serious risk that faces diabetic patients who fast during Ramadan (the 9th month in the Islamic calendar). New glucose-lowering classes like dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are efficacious in controlling blood glucose level with less tendency to induce hypoglycemia and thus may constitute a good choice for diabetic patients during Ramadan. This study reviews the safety and efficacy of newer glucose-lowering therapies during Ramadan. This study was accomplished through a careful literature search about studies that assess the benefit and side effects of these new glucose-lowering therapies during Ramadan during September 2015. Vildagliptin, sitagliptin, liraglutide, exenatide, and dapagliflozin were the only studied glucose-lowering therapies. All of the studied newer glucose-lowering therapies except dapagliflozin were associated with reduced risk to induce hypoglycemia. Gastrointestinal upset was common with the usage of liraglutide while increased thirst sensation was common with dapagliflozin. In conclusion DPP-4 inhibitors such as vildagliptin and sitagliptin may form a suitable glucose-lowering therapy option for Ramadan fasting patients.",

METHODS: Muslim patients with DM attending the Diabetes Centre of Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, were surveyed on their knowledge of DM and self-management of DM when fasting during Ramadan. Data on patient demographics, DM history and management of DM during the previous Ramadan was also collected. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients (34 male, 58 female) were surveyed. The mean age of the patients was 53.4 ± 13.3 years. The patients were either Malay (91.3%) or Indian (8.7%), and most (66.3%) had at least a secondary school education. Most (89.1%) had Type 2 DM. The mean duration of DM was 8.7 ± 5.1 years and mean pre-Ramadan haemoglobin A1c was 8.4% ± 1.8%. DM treatment consisted of insulin therapy (37.0%), oral glucose-lowering drugs (35.9%) and combined therapy (22.8%). The mean DM knowledge score was 58.8% for general knowledge and 75.9% for fasting knowledge. During the previous Ramadan, although 71.4% of the patients consulted their physicians, 37.3% did not monitor their blood glucose levels and 47.0% had hypoglycaemic episodes. Among those who had hypoglycaemia, 10.8% continued to fast. CONCLUSION: Unsafe self-management practices were observed among DM patients who fasted during Ramadan. Efforts should be made to bridge the gap between knowledge of DM and self-management of DM.",

However, there are no guidelines or standardized protocols that can help physicians to properly address the issue of patients with cancer fasting in Ramadan and correctly advising them. Moreover, in a more interconnected and globalized society, in which more and more Muslim patients live in the Western countries, this topic is of high interest also for the general practitioner. For this purpose, we carried out a systematic review on the subject. Our main findings are that (1) very few studies have been carried out, addressing this issue, (2) evidence concerning quality of life and compliance to treatment is contrasting and scarce, and (3) generally speaking, few patients ask their physicians whether they can safely fast or not. For these reasons, further research should be performed, given the relevance and importance of this topic."

Extended fasting hours produce changes in the body's metabolism during this period. A majority of the population who fast also restrict themselves from undergoing dental treatments due to a fear of breaking the fast. Even among health professionals, a certain amount of uncertainty prevails about the implications of treating a patient who is fasting. To help clinicians carry out safe and effective treatment without hampering a patient's religious beliefs, the present article focuses on the effect of Ramadan fasting on the body's metabolism and the ramifications for treatment aspects, including medications and dental procedures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intermittent fasting during the month of Ramadan, although not obligatory, is commonly practiced by Muslim children. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to describe the effects of Ramadan fasting on various physiological and neurobehavioral measures in preteen and teenaged boys. DESIGN: We conduced a prospective cohort study during Ramadan, observed from August 9 to September 11, 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen healthy Muslim boys (mean age±standard deviation 12.6±1.5 years) were recruited and assessed before, during (1st and 4th weeks), and after Ramadan. Subjects were classified as preteens (aged 9 to 12 years) or teens (aged 13 to 15 years). INTERVENTION: On each clinic visit, participants completed a match-to-sample test, a spatial planning and working memory task, and a working memory capacity test using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Participants were also assessed for their sleep patterns, daily energy expenditure, and dietary intake. Body composition was determined using a dual-energy x-ray scan. Complete blood count, lipid profile analysis, and iron indices were conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured morphologic, metabolic, and neurobehavioral parameters. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: A linear mixed model was used to assess changes in outcome measures. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed as necessary with Bonferroni adjustment. RESULTS: Within 1 week of fasting, there was a drop in body fat only in preteens (P=0.001). Reported fat (P=0.004) and protein intake (P=0.037) was higher during Ramadan, but energy expenditure did not change. By the end of Ramadan, there was a significant reduction in hemoglobin (mean±standard error -0.48±0.4 mmol/L) and serum iron (-25.7±31.8 μg/dL [-4.6±5.7 μmol/L]) levels. During week 4, total sleep duration decreased by 1.8 hours. At week 4, performance on the spatial planning and working memory task and working memory capacity test increased significantly (P=0.002), while match-to-sample test performance declined in preteens only (P=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Ramadan fasting was associated with significant changes in body composition, dietary intake, and sleep patterns. Reductions in attention and iron indices were observed in preteens only.",

The incidence of hypoglycemia and glycemic changes in relation to the adjustment of doses of antidiabetic agents, diet, and physical activity during Ramadan was also evaluated. Methods. This was a prospective study conducted in an outpatient endocrine clinic. A set of questionnaires was administered to Muslim patients with diabetes who fasted for ≥10 days. Those who were hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia a month prior to Ramadan or were given short-term corticosteroid therapy were excluded. The patients' responses and clinical outcomes from the clinic database were collected before, during, and after Ramadan. Results. A total of 153 participants completed the study. The mean HbA1c improved from 8.9% before Ramadan to 8.6% during Ramadan (P < 0.05). Although diet and physical activity did not contribute to changes in glycemia, a significant improvement in HbA1c was observed in patients who had adjustments made to their doses of antidiabetic agents during Ramadan (P < 0.001). In addition, their rate of hypoglycemia was minimal. Conclusions. Ramadan fasting appeared to improve glycemic control, especially in those whose doses of antidiabetic agents were adjusted during Ramadan."

However, there is scarcity of scientific literature regarding its effects on health determinants in cardiovascular disturbances like hypertension. OBJECTS: The present study was done to assess the (BP), body weight and serum cholesterol changes over the period of Ramadan fasting in patients with hypertension. Materails And Methods:This prospective observational trial was done on 15 hypertensive subjects who were in the age group of 35 to 65 years, who were determined to complete Ramadan fast. All subjects were on antihypertensive therapy. Outcome measures of (BP), body weight and serum cholesterol were assessed in all the subjects before and after Ramadan month. RESULTS: Mean age of subjects was 44.6 ± 5.62 years. Systolic BP decreased from 148 ± 19.6 to 132.5 ± 17.9 mm of Hg. The decrease of 15.5 units (95% CI: 7.5 to 24.4) was statistically significant (p = 0.0009). Diastolic BP decreased from 90.4 ± 7.8 to 81.1 ± 6.3 mm of Hg. The decrease of 9.3 units (95% CI: 5.7 to 13) was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). There was statistically significant decrease in body weight from 66.6 ± 13 to 65.2 ± 12.7 kg (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in serum cholesterol from 187.3 ± 28.9 to 192.7 ± 31.3 mg% (p = 0.37). CONCLUSION: Hypertensive patients with continuation of their medicines showed a decrease in blood pressure and reduction in body weight at the end of Ramadan fasting duration. However there was no change found in serum cholesterol levels."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Endothelial dysfunction, which can be manifested by loss of nitric oxide bioavailability, is an increasingly recognized cause of cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies showed that diets affect endothelial function and modify cardiovascular risks. This study aimed to assess the effects of Ramadan fasting, as a diet intervention, on endothelial function. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study population consisted of 21 male patients (mean age: 52±9 years) with cardiovascular risks (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial diseases). The biochemical variables in serum of patients were measured 2 days before and after Ramadan fasting. The levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were evaluated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nitric oxide (NO) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured by the Griess and thiobarbituric acid reaction substances assay, respectively. RESULTS: NO levels in patients after Ramadan fasting were significantly higher compared with the baseline value (85.1±11.54 vs 75.8±10.7 μmol/l) (P<0.05). Post-Ramadan levels of ADMA decreased significantly in comparison with pre-Ramadan levels (802.6±60.9 vs 837.6±51.0 nmol/l) (P<0.05). In addition, the levels of VEGF and MDA changed during Ramadan fasting, but these changes were not statistically significant (228.1±27.1 vs 222.7±22.9 pg/ml and 3.2±0.7 vs 3.6±1.1 μmol/l, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Ramadan fasting may have beneficial effects on endothelial function and can modulate cardiovascular risks. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of Ramadan fasting on cardiovascular health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hypoglycemia during the daytime of Ramadan fasting is the most feared complication of diabetes. Insulin pump therapy has been proposed as the ideal \"theoretical\" method for insulin delivery. We report a prospective observational, single-center study of insulin-treated patients using insulin pump therapy during Ramadan 2011. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients (10 males and 11 females) were selected; median age was 26 years. They adjusted their insulin as per their usual practices. Outcome measures obtained before and during Ramadan included body weight, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood glucose, total insulin dose differences, overriding tendency, suspension time during fasting, and number of hypoglycemic episodes. RESULTS: The patients fasted for a median of 29 days. The observed changes during Ramadan were overall not significant quantitatively, but some trends were noted. The total insulin administered during Ramadan was not different from that in the pre-Ramadan period, but there was a redistribution of insulin over a 24-h period in relation to the changes in the daily lifestyle and eating patterns. Basal insulin was decreased during the daytime by 5-20% from before Ramadan and increased during the nighttime. The mean change in the overall amount of basal insulin was not significant. A larger than usual amount of insulin bolus was given at the meals Iftar, Fowala, and Suhur; the change in the total amount of bolus insulin as a percentage change from total insulin was also not significant. No major hypoglycemic episodes were reported. Minor hypoglcemic episodes were equally distributed between daytime and nighttime and were managed by either basal insulin adjustment or suspension from the pump. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the advantages provided by insulin pump use in patients with diabetes were enhanced by the use of continuous glucose monitoring. We provided more evidence-based advice on how best to adjust the insulin pump during fasting.",

METHODS: This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 52 Turkish migrants with diabetes in Belgium. Two questionnaires collected information on socio-demographic characteristics, diabetes-related characteristics, current hypoglycaemic medication with dosing regimen, participation in the past Ramadan, reasons for (non-)participation, use of hypoglycaemic medication during the past Ramadan, advice from their healthcare providers about fasting during Ramadan and follow-up of this advice. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (31%) had fasted during the past Ramadan. Main reason for Ramadan participation was reinforcement of faith (12/15), while the main reason for non-participation was having diabetes (34/36). About 56% of the study population had received recommendations from their healthcare provider(s) about fasting and diabetes during Ramadan. The most commonly provided advice was not to participate in Ramadan, followed by modification of drug therapy. Only 3 patients ignored the advice of their health professionals. In addition, only 60% of those who actually fasted received recommendations about intake of diabetes medication during the Ramadan. Most fasters continued their medication dose unchanged (87% of OHA users and 80% of the insulin users). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study found a low prevalence of Ramadan fasting among Turkish migrants with diabetes in Belgium. We also found that provision of advice by healthcare providers could be improved. Larger scale studies are warranted to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate attitudes in hospital inpatients and physicians towards Ramadan fasting and diabetes in Marseille. METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the three months prior to the month of Ramadan. A total of 101 patients (age: 57±17 years) and 101 general practitioners (GPs) were recruited into the study. RESULTS: The patients had low levels of education (52% illiteracy). Of the 101 patients, 52 continued to fast during Ramadan, and only 65 patients had discussed the matter with their GP. Of these, 36 were told that fasting was forbidden, but more than half (n=19) fasted despite the medical advice. Six patients thus experienced daily hypoglycaemia because they had continued to take their hypoglycaemic agent or insulin analogue at noon. Both inadequate education and religious attitudes were found to endanger patients during the fast: 15 patients skipped the meal scheduled before dawn, five of whom persisted in taking their sulphonylurea. Also, 27% of patients refused, in spite of daytime hypoglycaemia, to ingest anything orally to avoid breaking their fast. Among the GP population, medical knowledge of Ramadan fasting with diabetes was low, leading to medically unjustified negative advice for fasting and a lack of patient education on adjusting treatments. This particular situation weakened the patient-physician relationship. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of Ramadan fasting for Muslim patients, and reveals a wide cross-cultural gap between GPs and their patients. Systematic advice on treatment adjustment needs to be given. For this reason, we encourage more sensitive care of these patients and more medical training for physicians.",

We attempted to evaluate the effect of the Ramadan fasting on the frequency of migraine attacks among observant Muslim migraine sufferers using a cohort cross-over study. Thirty-two observant Muslim migraine sufferers filled a migraine diary during the Ramadan month and the following month (control). Two patients failed to complete the fast because of migraine suffering. During the Ramadan month, the patient expressed 9.4 ± 4.3 migraine days in average (range 3-20) when compared with 3.7 ± 2.1 migraine days in average (range 1-10) during the control month (p < 0.001). This phenomenon was associated with longer duration of migraine, lower frequency of migraine attacks, and migraine with aura. It seemed to be less pronounced in patients experiencing throbbing headaches and in married patients. Previous prophylactic therapy did not dampen this. Physicians treating Muslim migraine patients should discuss potential Ramadan month exacerbation with their patients and provide counseling regarding the prevention of dehydration and caffeine withdrawal. Pharmacological prophylactic treatment should be considered.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many Moslem patients do observe the fast during Ramadan. There are limited data on insulin pump therapy during Ramadan. We report our experience with type 1 diabetes patients on insulin pumps during Ramadan 2008 (29 days). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 63 patients were evaluated. Forty-nine patients fasted, and 14 elected not to fast. Those who fasted (24 males, 25 females) were 22 +/- 7 years of age (mean +/- SD) and had had diabetes for 9.6 +/- 5.6 years. Patients used the Medtronic (Northridge, CA) MiniMed 722 model and had been using pump therapy for 20 +/- 10 months. Outcome measures included number of days fasted, hypoglycemia, unusual hyperglycemia, and number of emergency hospital visits. RESULTS: Thirty patients (61.2%) fasted the whole month with no problems, nine (18.4%) fasted 27-28 days, eight (16.3%) fasted 24-25 days, and two (4.1%) fasted 23 days. Nearly half of the patients decreased their basal insulin by 5-50% of their prefasting doses. Seventeen patients had hypoglycemia requiring breaking the fast. Fasting was broken on 55 out of 1,450 potential fasting days (3.8%). No severe hypoglycemia was reported by any patient. Unusual hyperglycemia was reported in nine patients (18.4%). Hospital visits were reported for one patient for hyperglycemia (a 16-year-old girl who disconnected her pump). Twelve patients had fructosamine levels measured both before and immediately after Ramadan; pre-Ramadan fructosamine level was 4.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, and the post-Ramadan value was 3.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/L (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Fasting during Ramadan is feasible in patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump, with adequate counseling and support.",

Significantly more patients were diagnosed with AUGIH during Ramadan compared with the non-Ramadan month (43 versus 28, respectively). Significantly more patients diagnosed during Ramadan had a history of previous haemorrhage compared with the non-Ramadan month (72.1% versus 42.9%, respectively). Peptic ulcer was the most common event in both groups and overall endoscopy findings differed between the groups. No other significant differences were found. In conclusion, the number of patients presenting with AUGIH during Ramadan was significantly higher than that of an ordinary month, which suggests that fasting during Ramadan reactivates and aggravates pre-existing gastrointestinal diseases.",

Adherence on ART among FT and NFT patients was similar during Ramadan, 96% and 98%, and ever since commencement of ART, 80% and 88%, respectively. FT patients altered their typical daily behaviors by advancing morning and delaying evening doses thereby prolonging dosing intervals, eating heavier meals pre-dawn and on breakfast at sunset (78%), and changing or reducing their sleeping and waking times (40%).

Blood pressure, waist circumference, body weight, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), TAG, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting blood insulin and insulin resistance indices (quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and reciprocal index of HOMA-IR (1/HOMA-IR)) were evaluated before and after 30 d of Ramadan fasting (two meals at 12 h intervals). The dietary intake was estimated by 24 h recall before and after fasting. The total daily energy intake was decreased by 234.6 (sd 88.2) kJ/d in the fasting period (P = 0.005). 1/HOMA-IR, QUICKI and HDL-C were significantly increased (P = 0.005, P = 0.001 and P = 0.004) and FPG significantly decreased (P < 0.005) after fasting. Simple linear regression analysis demonstrated that HOMA-IR, 1/HOMA-IR and QUICKI were related to waist circumference after intervention (r 0.458, P < 0.001; r - 0.396, P < 0.05; r - 0.342, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study showed that the combined change in the number and timing of meals and portioning of the entire intake into only two meals per d may increase insulin sensitivity in subjects with the metabolic syndrome even when the decrease in energy consumption is minimal.",

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Faghihi and Namazee Hospitals between September 1999 to August 2004. All files of patients with definite diagnosis of gallstone induced acute cholecystitis were reviewed for age, gender, date and method of treatment in relation to seasons and Ramadan fasting month. For comparison, we used Shaaban months (prior months) and Shavval months (following months). RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixty-four files (32.7% male and 62.8% were female) with definite diagnosis of acute cholecystitis were reviewed. Mean age was 56.3 +/- 16.18 years. The frequency of acute cholecystitis was higher in summer in comparison with other seasons. The difference in the frequency of acute cholecystitis in Ramadan in comparison with Shaaban and Shavval months was not considerable. CONCLUSION: Acute cholecystitis displays seasonal characteristics; however, this seasonal variability would be influenced by other unknown environmental and genetic factors. Ramadan fasting may not precipitate the onset of acute cholecystitis.",

Two hundred and thirty-five patients, previously treated with a sulphonylurea, were randomised to receive either repaglinide (n=116, preprandially three-times daily) or glibenclamide (n=119, preprandially once- or twice-daily) 6 weeks before Ramadan. During Ramadan, patients changed their eating pattern to two meals daily, and the daily dose of repaglinide was redistributed to two preprandial doses. After Ramadan, patients resumed their regular meal pattern and treatment dosage for 4 weeks. During Ramadan, a statistically significant reduction in mean serum fructosamine concentration from baseline was observed in the repaglinide group (-16.9+/-4.9 micromol/l, -3.8%, P<0.05) but not the glibenclamide group (-6.9+/-4.8 micromol/l, -0.8%). Difference in change in HbA(1c) from baseline was not statistically significant between groups. The number of hypoglycaemic events with midday blood glucose <4.5 mmol/l was significantly lower in the repaglinide group (2.8%) than the glibenclamide group (7.9%) (P=0.001). Apart from hypoglycaemia, both treatments were equally well tolerated. Type 2 diabetic Muslims using prandial repaglinide showed a trend towards better glycaemic control and had a lower frequency of hypoglycaemia than patients using glibenclamide during Ramadan.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In patients with metabolic and nutritional disorders such as diabetes and hyperlipidaemia, where strict compliance to advice on timing and composition of food intake is important, the prolonged daylight fasting during the month of Ramadan could produce undesirable biochemical consequences. AIM: The study aimed to compare pre- and post-Ramadan lipid and lipoprotein profiles in stable Kuwaiti hyperlipidaemic subjects attending a Lipid Clinic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study population comprised 64 adult Kuwaitis (33 M, 31 F) who had been attending a Lipid Clinic for at least 12 months and were considered stable, without any acute systemic illness. At each clinic visit, the following parameters were measured: weight, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), HDL, LDL, apo A-1, apo B, glucose and uric acid. These biochemical parameters were measured by routine automated analyzer techniques. The pre-Ramadan values comprised the means of two measurements taken at about 3 month and 1 month before commencement of Ramadan. Post-Ramadan values were obtained within 1 month of the end of the Ramadan fast. The parameters so obtained were compared in the whole group, and then according to gender, glycaemic status and modality of treatment (diet alone or with a fibrate or statin). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In the nondiabetic subjects, apo A-1 and apo A-1/apo B and apo A-1/HDL ratios were increased post-Ramadan (P<0.001). Weight did not change and the other lipid parameters-TC, TG, LDL, apo B-did not worsen. These observations, more consistent in the men than in the women, and in subjects treated with a fibrate or a statin rather than on diet alone, indicate a favorable coronary heart disease (CHD) risk profile. In the diabetic patients, these changes in the apo A-1 level and its ratio to HDL and apo B were also present, but TC and apo B levels increased, the latter significantly (P<0.05). These divergent effects in diabetic patients could variably influence CHD risk liability. Serum uric acid levels were also simultaneously reduced post-Ramadan in the non-diabetic subjects and those on statin treatment. CONCLUSION: When pre- and post-Ramadan lipid and lipoprotein profiles were compared in stable hyperlipidaemic subjects attending a Lipid Clinic in Kuwait, the most consistent changes post-Ramadan were increased levels of apo A-1 and apo A-1/apo B and apo A-1/HDL ratios and reduced uric acid levels. Body weight remained essentially unchanged and the other lipoprotein and lipid parameters were not worsened. These results suggest that Ramadan fasting in hyperlipidaemic subjects might favorably influence CHD risk.",

      "abstract": "Ramadan fasting is one of the Pillars of Islam. Its observance involves abstinence from eating and drinking from dawn until sunset during the entire holy month. The effects of Ramadan fasting on body physiology as well as on the different biochemical, hematological, and metabolic parameters are reviewed. Metabolic changes, when present, are mild and reversible. The effects of fasting on diabetes mellitus, treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, and anticoagulation therapy are discussed."
