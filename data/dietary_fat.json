      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The dietary fat supply might interact with the intestinal microbiota via different mechanisms. Research on this topic, however, remains scarce in cats. For this reason, the present study was conducted to evaluate the impact of the fat concentration and fatty acid profile in the diet on the fecal microbiota of healthy cats. METHODS: A low-fat basal diet was fed to ten healthy adult cats. The diet was offered without or with the daily addition of 0.5 g or 1 g of sunflower oil, fish oil or lard per kg body weight of the cats, using a randomized cross-over design. Each feeding period lasted for 21 days, and the fecal samples were collected on the last days of each period. The fecal microbiota was analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Additionally, microbial metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, lactate, ammonium, biogenic amines) were measured in the fecal samples. RESULTS: The dietary treatment had no impact on the alpha-diversity of the fecal microbiota or on the relative abundance of bacterial phyla in the samples. Only a few changes were observed in the relative abundance of bacterial genera and the concentrations of microbial metabolites in the feces, probably being of minor physiological relevance. CONCLUSIONS: The balanced intestinal microbiota of cats seems to be relatively resistant to moderate variations in the dietary fat supply over a short feeding period. Longer-term treatments and higher dietary fat levels should be evaluated in future studies to further clarify the relevance of fat intake for the feline gut microbiome."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of a diet supplemented with different levels of oleic acid (OA) on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, nutrient utilization, and intestinal lipid metabolism in Pekin ducks. A total of 350 fourteen-d-old male ducks were randomly assigned to the following five isonitrogenous and heteroenergetic dietary treatment groups: 0.00% (control), 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.00% OA groups. The experiment lasted 28 days. The findings indicated that neither growth performance nor nutrient utilization was affected by OA supplementation (P > 0.05). The 0.50% OA group displayed the lowest serum triglyceride (TG) levels among all treatment groups, with significantly lower values compared to both the 0.25%=% and 0.75% OA groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, the activities of lipid droplet (LD)-degrading enzymes in the jejunal mucosa, such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), showed a significant inverse linear relationship (P < 0.05); carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) activity exhibited a proportional dose-dependent increase (P < 0.05); and lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity was negatively correlated with the increased concentration of OA in the diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of the LD formation-related genes PLIN2 were significantly higher in the 0.50% OA group compared to the 0.25% and 0.75% OA groups (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of LD degradation-related genes, the PNPLA2 expression in the 0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75% OA groups and LPL expression in all OA groups were downregulated (P < 0.05) when compared with those in the control group. These results suggested that dietary supplementation with OA, especially at a level of 0.50%, may decrease the serum TG content and promote lipid deposition in the jejunum in Pekin ducks by regulating the formation and degradation of enterocyte LDs."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The gut microbiome (GM) is pivotal in regulating inflammation, immune responses, and cancer progression. This study investigates the effects of a ketogenic diet (KD) and a high-fat/low-carbohydrate (HF/LC) diet on GM alterations and tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (EOC). METHODS: Thirty female C57BL/6J mice injected with KPCA cells were randomized into KD, HF/LC, and low-fat/high-carbohydrate (LF/HC) diet groups. Tumor growth was monitored with live, in vivo imaging. Stool samples were collected at the time of euthanasia and analyzed by 16SrRNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to identify differential microbial taxonomic composition and metabolic function. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that KD and HF/LC diets significantly accelerated EOC tumor growth compared to the LF/HC diet in a xenograft model. GM diversity was markedly reduced in KD and HF/LC-fed mice, correlating with increased tumor growth, whereas LF/HC-fed mice showed higher GM diversity. Metagenomic analyses identified distinct alterations in microbial taxa including Bacteroides, Lachnospiracae bacterium, Bacterium_D16_50, and Enterococcus faecalis predominantly abundant in HF/LC-fed mice, Dubsiella_newyorkensis predominantly abundant in LF/HC-fed, and KD fed mice showing a higher abundance of Akkermansiaand Bacteroides. Functional pathways across diet groups indicated polyamine biosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation pathways were enriched in HF/LC-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the intricate relationship between diet, the gut microbiome, and tumor metabolism. The potential role of dietary interventions in cancer prevention and treatment warrants further investigation."

      "abstract": "Diet has been found to significantly influence gut microbiota throughout various life stages, and gut microbiota have been increasingly shown to influence host physiology, health, and behavior. This study uses 16S rRNA sequencing to examine the effects of six different fat-supplemented diets (canola oil, coconut oil, fish oil, flaxseed oil, lard, and olive oil) on broiler chicken cecal microbial composition and predicted function in comparison with a common and inexpensive fat source (poultry fat). Groups of broilers were fed each of these diets and then evaluated on day 41 and day 55 of age. For both 41- and 55-day samples, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla were the dominant bacteria in the ceca accounting for 99% of the microbial community. Across the 41- and 55-day samples, treatment time was associated with a stronger and more significant microbiota shift (p < 0.001) than differences in dietary treatment alone (p = 0.117), but dietary treatment combined with treatment time is a significant factor as well (p = 0.047). Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to explore the more discriminating taxa for each treatment group. For identified species, butyrate production appears to be affected in a diet-specific manner, with many butyrate-producing species being evident for the fish-based diet at day 41 and a few of these species for the flaxseed-based diet at day 55. Predicted functions, as conducted with PICRUSt2, were significant for comparisons between the control and the flaxseed-based dietary treatment group at day 55, with indications of host health benefit for the flaxseed-based diet. Predicted functions found to be significant were for enzymes and pathways such as propionate CoA ligase, aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase, vitamin B12-transporting ATPase, thiamine kinase, acetylneuraminate epimerase, and L-tryptophan biosynthesis. This study provides insight surrounding specific dietary fat-based treatments to be investigated further and highlights the importance of polyunsaturated fat sources in poultry feed that may offer a favorable cecal microbial modulation compared to saturated fat sources."

      "abstract": "Dietary fat can be used in dairy cow nutrition to reduce enteric methane (CH4), but studies with multiple dietary fat concentrations are scarce. Among fat sources, rapeseed is easily accessible in Europe and North America, and palm kernel fat has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of ruminal methanogenesis. Forty-eight cows (half primiparous and half multiparous) were used in a 6 × 6 Latin square design, with 6 periods of 21 d each. Six treatments were used: a control, 3 fat concentrations (low, medium, and high) of rapeseed (RS), and 2 fat concentrations (low and medium) of palm kernel fatty acids (PK). The total crude fat concentrations ranged from 3% to 7% of DM. The cows were fed the treatments as a partial mixed ration, and they received additional concentrate from the GreenFeed units (1 unit for 12 cows) used to measure CH4 production. Increased dietary crude fat concentration of both RS and PK reduced DMI. The reduction in DMI was stronger in cows fed medium concentration of PK than for any RS concentration, which was comparable to previous studies for both RS and PK. Digestibility of OM was highest at low fat concentration of both fat sources, and lowest at high RS concentration. Digestibility of NDF was reduced by 2 percentage units when cows were fed medium PK concentration instead of the control treatment. Rapeseed supplementation with dietary crude fat up to 5.7% of DM increased milk and ECM yields, but the equivalent PK concentration reduced ECM. Increased fat supplementation decreased CH4 yield (g CH4/kg of DMI) linearly when RS was used, and quadratically when PK was used. The medium PK concentration reduced CH4 yield more than medium RS concentration, but there was no difference for CH4 intensity (g CH4/kg of ECM). Rapeseed fat supplementation with dietary crude fat above 5.7% of DM could reduce further CH4 yield, but fat supplementation was not accompanied by an increase in productivity. The fat source must be accounted for when considering enteric methane reduction, as the PK provided stronger effect than RS, but the associated reduction in milk production did not support the use of PK for methane reduction.",

      "abstract": "Various types of dietary fats undergo distinct fermentation processes by gut microbes, potentially leading to the production of neurotransmitters that can influence the gut. Serotonin and dopamine are recognized neurotransmitters with positive effects on gut function. A broiler chicken trial was conducted to evaluate the influence of dietary fat types on protein expression of 2 neurotransmitter transporters, dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (5-HTT). A total of 560 day-old (Ross 708) male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 7 dietary treatments. The experimental treatments included a basal diet of corn-soybean meal (SBM), supplemented with 3% of various fats: poultry fat (CON), olive oil (OLIV), fish oil (FISH), canola oil (CANO), lard (LARD), coconut oil (COCO), or flaxseed oil (FLAX). Bodyweight (BW) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded. Ileal tissues were aseptically collected to determine the expression levels of DAT and 5-HTT through western blot analysis. In addition, plasma samples were analyzed for reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) tests on d 55. Results showed that dietary fat type inclusion did not have any detrimental effect on growth performance parameters. The expression levels of DAT were higher (P < 0.05) in FLAX treatments compared to CON treatments on d 20 and d 55, respectively. Similarly, with 5-HTT levels, FLAX, CANO, and LARD treatments were higher (P < 0.05) than CON treatments on d 20 and d 55. However, higher levels of oxidative stress (d-ROM values) were recorded in COCO (32.75 Carr U), CANO (29 Carr U), and CON treatments (25.5 Carr U) compared to FLAX (18.5 Carr U; P < 0.05) treatment. These findings suggest that incorporating dietary flaxseed oil at a 3% level in the diet has significant potential to elevate the expression levels of intestinal DAT and 5-HTT without inducing oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Current cardiometabolic disease prevention guidelines recommend increasing dietary unsaturated fat intake while reducing saturated fats. Here we use lipidomics data from a randomized controlled dietary intervention trial to construct a multilipid score (MLS), summarizing the effects of replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat on 45 lipid metabolite concentrations. In the EPIC-Potsdam cohort, a difference in the MLS, reflecting better dietary fat quality, was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (-32%; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): -21% to -42%) and type 2 diabetes (-26%; 95% CI: -15% to -35%). We built a closely correlated simplified score, reduced MLS (rMLS), and observed that beneficial rMLS changes, suggesting improved dietary fat quality over 10 years, were associated with lower diabetes risk (odds ratio per standard deviation of 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.98) in the Nurses' Health Study. Furthermore, in the PREDIMED trial, an olive oil-rich Mediterranean diet intervention primarily reduced diabetes incidence among participants with unfavorable preintervention rMLS levels, suggestive of disturbed lipid metabolism before intervention. Our findings indicate that the effects of dietary fat quality on the lipidome can contribute to a more precise understanding and possible prediction of the health outcomes of specific dietary fat modifications.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ serves as a crucial coenzyme in numerous essential biological reactions, and its cellular availability relies on the activity of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-catalyzed salvage pathway. Here we show that treatment with saturated fatty acids activates the NAD+ salvage pathway in hypothalamic astrocytes. Furthermore, inhibition of this pathway mitigates hypothalamic inflammation and attenuates the development of obesity in male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Mechanistically, CD38 functions downstream of the NAD+ salvage pathway in hypothalamic astrocytes burdened with excess fat. The activation of the astrocytic NAMPT-NAD+-CD38 axis in response to fat overload induces proinflammatory responses in the hypothalamus. It also leads to aberrantly activated basal Ca2+ signals and compromised Ca2+ responses to metabolic hormones such as insulin, leptin, and glucagon-like peptide 1, ultimately resulting in dysfunctional hypothalamic astrocytes. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the hypothalamic astrocytic NAD+ salvage pathway, along with its downstream CD38, to HFD-induced obesity.",

The influence of high dietary fat levels in a low or high energy density diet on the performance of weaned piglets in relation to intestinal absorptive function, amino acid utilization, oxidative stress, and microbial metabolites was assessed in this study. The study examined the effect of two different diets containing either a low energy density/high-fat level or a high energy density/high-fat level. A total of 16 healthy weaners (9.60 ± 0.13 kg) were allocated to one of the two dietary treatments. There were eight weaners per treatment. Results showed that feed intake and body weight gain of weaners were increased by the diet of high energy density/high-fat level (p < 0.05), but the feed efficiency showed an increased tendency of significance (p = 0.05). In the duodenum, the villus height (VH) and VH/crypt depth (CD) ratio (VH:CD) were increased by dietary high energy density/high fat. In the jejunum and ileum, the CD was increased by low energy density/high-fat diet, while the goblet cell count and VH:CD were increased by dietary high energy density/high-fat level. Methionine, lysine and phenylalanine concentrations were increased by high energy density/high-fat diet while low energy density/high-fat diet showed an increased tendency to increase citrulline and ornithine concentrations in the piglet. Oxidative stress marker, lactase enzyme activity and serum calcium concentration were increased by a high energy density/high-fat diet. Increased dietary fat in all diets induced diarrhoea in the weaners (p < 0.01). It was concluded that a dietary high energy density/high-fat diet seems to positively modulate gut absorptive function, serum amino acid (methionine and lysine), calcium levels and increased oxidative stress markers in the weaned piglets.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of gallstones varies between less than 1% and 64% in different populations and is thought to be increasing in response to changes in nutritional intake and increasing obesity. Some people with gallstones have no symptoms but approximately 2% to 4% develop them each year, predominantly including severe abdominal pain. People who experience symptoms have a greater risk of developing complications. The main treatment for symptomatic gallstones is cholecystectomy. Traditionally, a low-fat diet has also been advised to manage gallstone symptoms, but there is uncertainty over the evidence to support this. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of modified dietary fat intake in the treatment of gallstone disease in people of any age. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE ALL Ovid, Embase Ovid, and three other databases to 17 February 2023 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with gallstones. We also searched online trial registries and pharmaceutical company sources, for ongoing or unpublished trials to March 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in people with gallstones diagnosed using ultrasonography or conclusive imaging methods. We excluded participants diagnosed with another condition that may compromise dietary fat tolerance. We excluded trials where data from participants with gallstones were not reported separately from data from participants who did not have gallstones. We included trials that investigated other interventions (e.g. trials of drugs or other dietary (non-fat) components) providing that the trial groups had received the same proportion of drug or other dietary (non-fat) components in the intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We intended to undertake meta-analysis and present the findings according to Cochrane recommendations. However, as we identified only five trials, with data unsuitable and insufficient for analyses, we described the data narratively. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials but only one randomised clinical trial (69 adults), published in 1986, reported outcomes of interest to the review. The trial had four dietary intervention groups, three of which were relevant to this review. We assessed the trial at high risk of bias. The dietary fat modifications included a modified cholesterol intake and medium-chain triglyceride supplementation. The control treatment was a standard diet. The trial did not report on any of the primary outcomes in this review (i.e. all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life). The trial reported on gallstone dissolution, one of our secondary outcomes. We were unable to apply the GRADE approach to determine certainty of evidence because the included trial did not provide data that could be used to generate an estimate of the effect on this or any other outcome. The trial expressed its finding as \"no significant effect of a low-cholesterol diet in the presence of ursodeoxycholic acid on gallstone dissolution.\" There were no serious adverse events reported. The included trial reported that they received no funding that could bias the trial results through conflicts of interest. We found no ongoing trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence about the effects of modifying dietary fat on gallstone disease versus standard diet is scant. We lack results from high-quality randomised clinical trials which investigate the effects of modification of dietary fat and other nutrient intakes with adequate follow-up. There is a need for well-designed trials that should include important clinical outcomes such as mortality, quality of life, impact on dissolution of gallstones, hospital admissions, surgical intervention, and adverse events.",

We studied the impact of the quality of dietary fat on plasma (p) and fecal (f) SCFA and p-BCAA in men homozygous for the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant (I148M). Eighty-eight randomly assigned men (age 67.8 ± 4.3 years, body mass index 27.1 ± 2.5 kg/m2) participated in a 12-week diet intervention. The recommended diet (RD) group followed the National and Nordic nutrition recommendations for fat intake. The average diet (AD) group followed the average fat intake in Finland. The intervention resulted in a decrease in total p-SCFAs and iso-butyric acid in the RD group (p = 0.041 and p = 0.002). Valeric acid (p-VA) increased in participants with the GG genotype regardless of the diet (RD, 3.6 ± 0.6 to 7.0 ± 0.6 µmol/g, p = 0.005 and AD, 3.8 ± 0.3 to 9.7 ± 8.5 µmol/g, p = 0.015). Also, genotype relation to p-VA was seen statistically significantly in the RD group (CC: 3.7 ± 0.4 to 4.2 ± 1.7 µmol/g and GG: 3.6 ± 0.6 to 7.0 ± 0.6 µmol/g, p = 0.0026 for time and p = 0.004 for time and genotype). P-VA, unlike any other SCFA, correlated positively with plasma gamma-glutamyl transferase (r = 0.240, p = 0.025). Total p-BCAAs concentration changed in the AD group comparing PNPLA3 CC and GG genotypes (CC: 612 ± 184 to 532 ± 149 µmol/g and GG: 587 ± 182 to 590 ± 130 µmol/g, p = 0.015 for time). Valine decreased in the RD group (p = 0.009), and leucine decreased in the AD group (p = 0.043). RD decreased total fecal SCFA, acetic acid (f-AA), and butyric acid (f-BA) in those with CC genotype (p = 0.006, 0.013 and 0.005, respectively). Our results suggest that the PNPLA3 genotype modifies the effect of dietary fat modification for p-VA, total f-SCFA, f-AA and f-BA, and total p-BCAA.",

Thirty steers (386 ± 24.6 kg of body weight [BW]; 12 months old), blocked by BW, were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments with varying fat concentrations in concentrate mix (48, 74, and 99 g of ether extract per kg dry matte [DM]). The fat intake of the low-fat treatment represented 4.15% of the total dry matter intake (DMI), while the medium- and high-fat treatments accounted for 5.77% and 7.23% of total DMI, respectively. Concentrate mix DMI decreased with increasing fat level (p < 0.01). The growth rate and digestibility did not significantly differ based on the fat level (p > 0.05). As the fat level increased, propionate in the total ruminal volatile fatty acids increased, and butyrate and acetate-to-propionate decreased (p < 0.01). Cholesterol in blood serum increased significantly with increasing dietary fat levels (p < 0.01). Methane emissions exhibited a linear decrease with increasing fat level (p < 0.05). In conclusion, elevating fat content in the concentrates up to 100 g/kg DM reduced methane emissions without compromising the growth performance of growing Hanwoo steers."

      "abstract": "Depression is often associated with fatigue/energy loss. However, we lack a detailed understanding of the factors explaining this association. In this study, we uncovered that depressed mice have a defect in fat absorption, resulting in weight loss and reduced circulating lipid levels. Si-Ni-San (SNS), a basic formula of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of depression, was found to not only alleviate depression-like behaviors, but also reverse the weight loss and dietary fat absorption of depressed mice. We found that SNS improved body weight and circulating lipid levels of depressed mice by up-regulating proteins [such as FFA uptake protein (CD36), TAG synthesis proteins (GPAT3, MOGAT2, DGAT1 and DGAT2) and chylomicron packaging proteins (MTP and APOB)] in the fat absorption pathway. Furthermore, cell-based results conducted with LPS-stimulated mouse MODE-K and human Caco-2 cells support that SNS, as well as Sinensetin (SIN) and Nobiletin (NOB), the two active components of the formula, have a role in regulating lipid absorption. Mechanistic studies revealed that SNS reverses body weight and fat absorption defects of depressed mice in part through the NR1D1/BMAL1/DGAT2 axis. These findings advance our understanding of the crosstalk between depression and energy loss, highlight the importance of gut function in disease management, and provide a basis for the application of SNS in the clinical treatment of depression and related disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy is a serious and common neurological condition in dogs, despite the wide number of antiepileptic drugs available, in approximately one third of the patients, epilepsy remains unsatisfactorily controlled. We aim to analyze whether feeding dietary fat sources during puppyhood was associated with canine epilepsy in adulthood. METHODS: A nested case-control study was compiled from the validated DogRisk food frequency questionnaire (DogRisk FFQ). DogRisk FFQ collected feeding, disease, and background data about the dog. The study sample consisted of 108 owner-reported epileptic cases and 397 non-epileptic controls. Each case was matched with up to four controls for the key confounding factors of sex, breed, and age. We analyzed associations between feeding as a puppy and owner-reported epilepsy as an adult dog using Cox regression. We tested 55 different food variables. RESULTS: We found that feeding fish fat from dietary sources at least once a week during puppyhood was inversely associated with epilepsy in later life in the unadjusted analysis [OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.25-0.83), p=0.01], while when adjusting for keeping conditions and dog characteristics the association was [OR 0.45 (95% CI 0.23-0.88), p=0.02]. When adjusted for keeping conditions, dog characteristics, and other feeding factors, the association was of similar magnitude but not significance [OR 0.56 (95% CI 0.27-1.15), p=0.12]. DISCUSSION: The study indicates possible protective associations of feeding the dog with dietary sources of fish fat against epilepsy, although the result could be confounded by other feeding factors. Findings are compatible with current knowledge regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids and ketogenic diet, a low carbohydrate, high fat diet as supportive treatments of epilepsy. As our findings are based on observations, we suggest the possibility of causality but do not prove it. Dietary intervention studies should now be conducted to confirm our findings."

Lipid metabolism often includes the digestion and absorption of dietary fat, and the ways in which cancer cells utilize lipids are often influenced by the complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Among multiple cancer risk factors, obesity has a positive association with multiple cancer types, while diets like calorie restriction and fasting improve health and delay cancer. Impact of these diets on tumorigenesis or cancer prevention are generally studied on cancer cells, despite heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells regularly interact with these heterogeneous microenvironmental components, including immune and stromal cells, to promote cancer progression and metastasis, and there is an intricate metabolic crosstalk between these compartments. Here, we focus on discussing fat metabolism and response to dietary fat in the tumor microenvironment, focusing on both immune and stromal components and shedding light on therapeutic strategies surrounding lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.",

A new lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-rich structured lipid powder has micelle-like activity that facilitates digestion and absorption, independent of lipase and bile acids. The aim of this secondary analysis was to determine if recycled LPC increased fat absorption of coingested food. Fasting plasma fatty acid (FA) concentrations were measured at baseline and 3 mo in children (n = 84) with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency. Plasma palmitic acid was selected because of its dietary prevalence and was a minor component of the LPC product. Palmitic acid increased 15% in the LPC product-treated total subjects (P = 0.01) and 23% in the subgroup with more severe malabsorption (P = 0.007), with no change in either group on placebo. Total FAs increased 11% (P = 0.009) and 20% (P = 0.005), respectively. Increased palmitic acid and total FA suggest that LPC provided by the product created an intraluminal environment that increased coingested dietary fat absorption and provided more calories.

      "abstract": "Obesity is a multifactorial disease that continues to increase in prevalence worldwide. Emerging evidence has shown that the development of obesity may be influenced by taxonomic shifts in gut microbiota in response to the consumption of dietary fats. Further, these alterations in gut microbiota have been shown to promote important changes in satiation signals including gut hormones (leptin, ghrelin, GLP-1, peptide YY and CCK) and orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides (AgRP, NPY, POMC, CART) that influence hyperphagia and therefore obesity. In this review, we highlight mechanisms by which gut microbiota can influence these satiation signals both locally in the gastrointestinal tract and via microbiota-gut-brain communication. Then, we describe the effects of dietary interventions and associated changes in gut microbiota on satiety signals through microbiota-dependent mechanisms. Lastly, we present microbiota optimizing therapies including prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and weight loss surgery that can help restore beneficial gut microbiota by enhancing satiety signals to reduce hyperphagia and subsequent obesity. Overall, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which dietary fats induce taxonomical shifts in gut microbiota and their impact on satiation signaling pathways will help develop more targeted therapeutic interventions in delaying the onset of obesity and in furthering its treatment.",

PURPOSE: To evaluate in a composite population the relationships between changes in dietary fat intake and changes in FA levels in serum cholesterol esters. METHODS: In a multinational, parallel-design, dietary intervention (KANWU study), dietary intakes (3-day food record) and FA composition of serum cholesterol esters (gas-liquid chromatography) were evaluated at baseline and after 3 months in 162 healthy individuals, randomly assigned to a diet containing a high proportion of saturated (SFA) or monounsaturated (MUFA) fat, with a second random assignment to fish oil or placebo supplements. RESULTS: Main differences in serum lipid composition after the two diets included saturated (especially myristic, C14:0, and pentadecanoic, C15:0) and monounsaturated (oleic acid, C18:1 n-9) FA. C14:0 and C15:0 were related to SFA intake, while C18:1 n-9 was associated with MUFA intake. Fish oil supplementation induced a marked increase in eicosapentaenoic (C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6 n-3) acids. After the 3-month intervention, Δ-9 desaturase activity, calculated as palmitoleic acid/palmitic acid (C16:1/C16:0) ratio, was more reduced after the MUFA (0.31±0.10 vs 0.25±0.09, p<0.0001) than SFA diet (0.31±0.09 vs 0.29±0.08, p=0.006), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that serum cholesterol ester FA composition can be used during randomized controlled trials as an objective indicator of adherence to experimental diets based on saturated and monounsaturated fat modifications, as well as fish oil supplementation.",

Here, we use WHI observational data for further insight into the chronic disease implications of adopting this type of low-fat dietary pattern. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to use our earlier work on metabolomics-based biomarkers of carbohydrate and protein to develop a fat intake biomarker by subtraction, to use the resulting biomarker to develop calibration equations that adjusts self-reported fat intake for measurement error, and to study associations of biomarker-calibrated fat intake with chronic disease risk in WHI cohorts. Corresponding studies for specific fatty acids will follow separately. METHODS: Prospective disease association results are presented using WHI cohorts of postmenopausal women, aged 50-79 y when enrolled at 40 United States clinical centers. Biomarker equations were developed using an embedded human feeding study (n = 153). Calibration equations were developed using a WHI nutritional biomarker study (n = 436). Calibrated intakes were associated with cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes incidence in WHI cohorts (n = 81,954) over an approximate 20-y follow-up period. RESULTS: A biomarker for fat density was developed by subtracting protein, carbohydrate, and alcohol densities from one. A calibration equation was developed for fat density. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for 20% higher fat density were 1.16 (1.06, 1.27) for breast cancer, 1.13 (1.02, 1.26) for CHD, and 1.19 (1.13, 1.26) for diabetes, in substantial agreement with findings from the DM trial. With control for additional dietary variables, especially fiber, fat density was no longer associated with CHD, with hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.00 (0.88, 1.13), whereas that for breast cancer was 1.11 (1.00, 1.24). CONCLUSIONS: WHI observational data support prior DM trial findings of low-fat dietary pattern benefits in this population of postmenopausal United States women.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Partial hepatectomy is a preferred treatment option for many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma however, pre-existing pathological abnormalities originating from hepatic steatosis can alter the decision to perform surgery or postoperative outcomes as a consequence of the impact steatosis has on liver regeneration. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a saturated or unsaturated high fat diet-mediated steatosis on liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. METHODS: Mice were fed a low-fat control diet (CD, 13% fat), lard-based unsaturated (LD, 60% fat) or milk-based saturated high fat diet (MD, 60% fat) for 16 weeks at which time partial hepatectomy (approx. 70% resection) was performed. At days-2 and 7 post hepatectomy, one hour prior to euthanization, mice were injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine in order to monitor hepatic regeneration. Serum was collected and assessed for levels of ALT and AST. Resected and regenerated liver tissue were examined for inflammation-indicative markers employing RT-PCR, Western blots, and histological methods. RESULTS: Mice fed LD or MD exhibited higher NAFLD scores, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, macrophage accumulation, increased apoptosis, and elevated levels of serum ALT and AST activities, a decrease in the number of BrdU-incorporated-hepatocytes in the regenerated livers compared to the mice fed CD. Mice fed MD showed significantly lower percent of BrdU-incorporated hepatocytes and a higher trend of inflammation compared to the mice fed LD. CONCLUSION: A diet rich in saturated or unsaturated fat results in NASH with decreased hepatic regeneration however unsaturated fat diet cause lower inflammation and higher regeneration than the saturated fat diet following partial hepatectomy in mice.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of changing the ratio of palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids in dietary fat on nutritional metabolism, growth performance, and meat quality of finishing Angus bulls. Bulls received the following three treatments: (1) a control diet without fat supplement (CON), (2) CON + mixed fatty acid supplement (58% C16:0 + 28% cis-9 C18:1; MIX), (3) CON + saturated fatty acid supplement (87% C16:0 + 10% C18:0; SFA). In summary, both fat treatment diets simultaneously increased saturated fatty acids C16:0 (P = 0.025), C18:0 (P < 0.001) and total monounsaturated fatty acids (P = 0.008) in muscle, thus balancing the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in muscle. MIX diet increased the digestibility of dry matter (P = 0.014), crude protein (P = 0.038), and ether extract (P = 0.036). SFA diet increased the daily gain (P = 0.032) and intramuscular fat content (P = 0.043). The high content of C16:0 and C18:0 in the SFA diet promoted weight gain and fat deposition of beef cattle by increasing feed intake, up-regulating the expression of lipid uptake genes and increasing deposition of total fatty acids, resulting in better growth performance and meat quality.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common complication in hemodialysis patients. Nutritional education provided by dietitians could improve overall dietary quality and dietary fat quality to reduce the risk of CVD. However, no studies have investigated the relationship between dietary fat quality (using the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio, or the h/H) and CVD risk factors in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to examine the association between the h/H and CVD risk factors, and further explore how nutritional education intervention models could improve dietary fat quality and CVD risk factors in hemodialysis patients. A quasi-experimental design was conducted from May 2019 to April 2021 on four groups, including 'no course for patients and nurses' as the non-C group, a \"course for nurses\" as the CN group, a \"course for patients\" as the CP group, and a \"course for patients and nurses\" as the CPN group. Nutritional education booklets based on a healthy eating index for hemodialysis patients were developed and provided to patients and nurses. Data of 119 patients were collected at baseline, intervention, and follow-up periods, including patients' basic information, blood biochemical data, dietary content, and calculated h/H. The results showed that the h/H was negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Compared with the non-C group, the CPN group was significantly higher in the h/H as well as HDL-C, and significantly lower in serum total cholesterol. In conclusion, the h/H was found to predict CVD risk factors, which helps in improving dyslipidemia. Nutritional education for both patients and nurses showed a beneficial impact on reducing CVD risks in hemodialysis patients.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of a high-fat diet and soda consumption on oxidative stress and inflammation in Wistar rats. METHODS: Thirty-two male and female Wistar rats were equally divided into four dietary groups as follows: control, soda only, high fat (HFD), and high fat and carbonated soda (HFD/soda) and were placed on the dietary treatment for 14 wk, after acclimatization. At the end of the dietary treatment period, anthropometrics, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant activity, and inflammatory markers were assessed. RESULTS: Anthropometric variables and lipid peroxidation were increased in animals fed the high fat and soda diet. There was a decrease in antioxidant levels. CONCLUSION: The results from this study demonstrated that a HFD in combination with soda increased the effects of oxidative stress and inflammation in Wistar rats.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for gastrointestinal malignancies and tumors. However, which factors either protect or predispose the gastrointestinal organs to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced neoplasia remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HFD impacts the stomach to a greater extent as compared to the colorectum, resulting in leptin receptor (LepR) signaling-mediated neoplasia in the tissues. HFD activated leptin signaling, which in turn, accelerates the pathogenesis in the gastric mucosa more than that in the colorectum along with ectopic TFF3 expression. Moreover, in the stomach, higher levels of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in addition to the activation of STAT3 and Akt were observed as compared to the colorectum. The mice with LepR deletion in the gastrointestinal epithelium exhibited a suppressed induction of leptin, TFF3, and phosphorylated EGFR in the stomach, whereas the levels in the colorectum were insignificant. In co-transfected COS-7 cells with LepR and EGFR plasmid DNA, leptin transactivated EGFR to accelerate TFF3 induction along with activation of STAT3, ERK1/2, Akt, and PI3K p85/p55. Furthermore, TFF3 could bind to EGFR but did not transactivate LepR. Leptin-induced TFF3 induction was markedly suppressed by inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002) and EGFR (Erlotinib). Together, these results suggest a novel role of LepR-mediated signaling in transactivating EGFR that leads to TFF3 expression via the PI3K-Akt pathway. Therefore, this study sheds light on the identification of potentially new therapeutic targets for the treatment of pre-cancerous symptoms in stomach and colorectum.",

We examined dietary fat in relation to all-cause mortality and cancer progression or death among 1149 people in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance)/Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 80405 trial who completed a food frequency questionnaire at initiation of treatment for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. We examined saturated, monounsaturated, total and specific types (n-3, long-chain n-3 and n-6) of polyunsaturated fat, animal and vegetable fats. We hypothesized higher vegetable fat intake would be associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality and cancer progression. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Over median follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 5.3, 7.2 y), we observed 974 deaths and 1077 events of progression or death. Participants had a median age of 59 y; 41% were female and 86% identified as White. Moderate or higher vegetable fat was associated with lower risk of mortality and cancer progression or death (HRs comparing second, third and fourth to first quartile for all-cause mortality: 0.74 [0.62, 0.90]; 0.75 [0.61, 0.91]; 0.79 [0.63, 1.00]; P trend: .12; for cancer progression or death: 0.74 [0.62, 0.89]; 0.78 [0.64, 0.95]; 0.71 [0.57, 0.88]; P trend: .01).

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary fatty acid (FA) composition on bile acid (BA) metabolism in a pig model of NAFLD, by using a multiomics approach combined with histology and serum biochemistry. Thirty 20-day-old Iberian pigs pair-housed in pens were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 hypercaloric diets for 10 wk: 1) lard-enriched (LAR; n = 5 pens), 2) olive oil-enriched (OLI; n = 5), and 3) coconut oil-enriched (COC; n = 5). Animals were euthanized on week 10 after blood sampling, and liver, colon, and distal ileum (DI) were collected for histology, metabolomics, and transcriptomics. Data were analyzed by multivariate and univariate statistics. Compared with OLI and LAR, COC increased primary and secondary BAs in liver, plasma, and colon. In addition, both COC and OLI reduced circulating fibroblast growth factor 19, increased hepatic necrosis, composite lesion score, and liver enzymes in serum, and upregulated genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation and DNA repair. The severity of liver disease in COC and OLI pigs was associated with increased levels of phosphatidylcholines, medium-chain triacylglycerides, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and long-chain acylcarnitines in the liver, and the expression of profibrotic markers in DI, but not with changes in the composition or size of BA pool. In conclusion, our results indicate a role of dietary FAs in the regulation of BA metabolism and progression of NAFLD. Interventions that aim to modify the composition of dietary FAs, rather than to regulate BA metabolism or signaling, may be more effective in the treatment of NAFLD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Bile acid homeostasis and signaling is disrupted in NAFLD and may play a central role in the development of the disease. However, there are no studies addressing the impact of diet on bile acid metabolism in patients with NAFLD. In juvenile Iberian pigs, we show that fatty acid composition in high-fat high-fructose diets affects BA levels in liver, plasma, and colon but these changes were not associated with the severity of the disease.",

Therefore, we investigated the association between dietary fat intake and hyperuricemia with and without decreased kidney function in males living in Shika Town, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. This study included 361 males with a mean age of 60.7 years. Dietary fat and fatty acid intakes were evaluated using the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire. Reduced kidney function was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, while hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acid level >7.0 mg/dL. A two-way analysis of covariance showed that saturated fatty acid (p = 0.026), monounsaturated fatty acid (p = 0.014), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (p = 0.022) were significantly lower in the high uric acid group than in the normal uric acid group. In multiple logistic analysis stratified by renal function, lipid intake was negatively associated with hyperuricemia in the low eGFR group. These findings suggest that higher dietary lipid/fatty acid intake may be effective in the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in men with CKD.",

We examined the hypothesis that the modulation of bile acid metabolism by dietary fat contents, gallbladder removal (GBX; cholecystectomy), and bile acid sequestrant (BAS; cholestyramine) treatment could alter energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism through the changes in the gut microbiota. Mice were randomly assigned to the following six groups: (1) Sham GBX surgery (Sham) + low fat/high carbohydrate diet (LFD), (2) Sham + high fat diet (HFD), (3) Sham + HFD + BAS, (4) GBX + LFD, (5) GBX + HFD, and (6) GBX + HFD + BAS. BAS groups received 2% cholestyramine. After an 8-week intervention, energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism, and the gut microbiota community were measured. HFD groups exhibited higher body weight gain than LFD, and GBX increased the weight gain comped to Sham groups regardless of BAS in HFD (p < 0.05). Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was higher in HFD than LFD, and GBX increased it regardless of BAS. Serum lipid profiles were worsened in GBX + HFD compared to Sham + LFD, whereas BAS alleviated them, except for serum HDL cholesterol. Hepatic tumor-necrosis-factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression and lipid peroxide contents increased with GBX and BAS treatment compared to Sham and no BAS treatment (p < 0.05). Hepatic mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP1c) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) exhibited the same trend as that of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The α-diversity of gut bacteria decreased in GBX + HFD and increased in GBX + HFD + BAS. Akkermentia, Dehalobacterium, SMB53, and Megamonas were high in the Sham + LFD, and Veillonella and Streptococcus were rich in the Sham + HFD, while Oscillospira and Olsenella were high in Sham + HFD + BAS (p < 0.05). GBX + LFD increased Lactobacillus and Sutterella while GBX + HFD + BAS elevated Clostridium, Alistipes, Blautia, Eubacterium, and Coprobacillus (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the modulation of bile acid metabolism influences energy, glucose, and lipid metabolisms, and it might be linked to changes in the gut microbiota by bile acid metabolism modulation.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: UK guidelines recommend dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) should not exceed 10% total energy (%TE) for cardiovascular disease prevention, with benefits observed when SFAs are replaced with unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a dietary exchange model using commercially available foods to replace SFAs with UFAs. METHODS: Healthy men (n = 109, age 48, SD 11 year) recruited to the Reading, Imperial, Surrey, Saturated fat Cholesterol Intervention-1 (RISSCI-1) study (ClinicalTrials.Gov n°NCT03270527) followed two sequential 4-week isoenergetic moderate-fat (34%TE) diets: high-SFA (18%TE SFAs, 16%TE UFAs) and low-SFA (10%TE SFAs, 24%TE UFAs). Dietary intakes were assessed using 4-day weighed diet diaries. Nutrient intakes were analysed using paired t-tests, fasting plasma phospholipid fatty acid (PL-FA) profiles and dietary patterns were analysed using orthogonal partial least square discriminant analyses. RESULTS: Participants exchanged 10.2%TE (SD 4.1) SFAs for 9.7%TE (SD 3.9) UFAs between the high and low-SFA diets, reaching target intakes with minimal effect on other nutrients or energy intakes. Analyses of dietary patterns confirmed successful incorporation of recommended foods from commercially available sources (e.g. dairy products, snacks, oils, and fats), without affecting participants' overall dietary intakes. Analyses of plasma PL-FAs indicated good compliance to the dietary intervention and foods of varying SFA content. CONCLUSIONS: RISSCI-1 dietary exchange model successfully replaced dietary SFAs with UFAs in free-living healthy men using commercially available foods, and without altering their dietary patterns. Further intervention studies are required to confirm utility and feasibility of such food-based dietary fat replacement models at a population level.",

      "abstract": "Postprandial dyslipidemia is a metabolic condition commonly associated with insulin-resistant states, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by the overproduction of intestinal chylomicron particles and excess atherogenic chylomicron remnants in circulation. We have previously shown that glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) augments dietary fat uptake and chylomicron production in insulin-resistant states; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies have implicated nitric oxide (NO) in the absorptive actions of GLP-2. In this study, we report a novel role for neuronal NO synthase (nNOS)-mediated NO generation in lipid uptake and chylomicron formation based on studies in C57BL/6J mice, nNOS-/- mice, and Syrian golden hamsters after intraduodenal and oral fat administration. GLP-2 treatment in wild-type (WT) mice significantly increased postprandial lipid accumulation and circulating apolipoprotein B48 protein levels, while these effects were abolished in nNOS-/- mice. nNOS inhibition in Syrian golden hamsters and protein kinase G (PKG) inhibition in WT mice also abrogated the effect of GLP-2 on postprandial lipid accumulation. These studies demonstrate a novel mechanism in which nNOS-generated NO is crucial for GLP-2-mediated lipid absorption and chylomicron production in both mouse and hamster models. Overall, our data implicate an nNOS-PKG-mediated pathway in GLP-2-mediated stimulation of dietary fat absorption and intestinal chylomicron production.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In blood and tissues, dietary and endogenously generated fatty acids (FAs) occur in free form or as part of complex lipid molecules that collectively represent the lipidome of the respective tissue. We assessed associations of plasma lipids derived from high-resolution lipidomics with incident cardiometabolic diseases and subsequently tested if the identified risk-associated lipids were sensitive to dietary fat modification. METHODS: The EPIC Potsdam cohort study (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) comprises 27 548 participants recruited within an age range of 35 to 65 years from the general population around Potsdam, Germany. We generated 2 disease-specific case cohorts on the basis of a fixed random subsample (n=1262) and all respective cohort-wide identified incident primary cardiovascular disease (composite of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke; n=551) and type 2 diabetes (n=775) cases. We estimated the associations of baseline plasma concentrations of 282 class-specific FA abundances (calculated from 940 distinct molecular species across 15 lipid classes) with the outcomes in multivariable-adjusted Cox models. We tested the effect of an isoenergetic dietary fat modification on risk-associated lipids in the DIVAS randomized controlled trial (Dietary Intervention and Vascular Function; n=113). Participants consumed either a diet rich in saturated FAs (control), monounsaturated FAs, or a mixture of monounsaturated and n-6 polyunsaturated FAs for 16 weeks. RESULTS: Sixty-nine lipids associated (false discovery rate<0.05) with at least 1 outcome (both, 8; only cardiovascular disease, 49; only type 2 diabetes, 12). In brief, several monoacylglycerols and FA16:0 and FA18:0 in diacylglycerols were associated with both outcomes; cholesteryl esters, free fatty acids, and sphingolipids were largely cardiovascular disease specific; and several (glycero)phospholipids were type 2 diabetes specific. In addition, 19 risk-associated lipids were affected (false discovery rate<0.05) by the diets rich in unsaturated dietary FAs compared with the saturated fat diet (17 in a direction consistent with a potential beneficial effect on long-term cardiometabolic risk). For example, the monounsaturated FA-rich diet decreased diacylglycerol(FA16:0) by 0.4 (95% CI, 0.5-0.3) SD units and increased triacylglycerol(FA22:1) by 0.5 (95% CI, 0.4-0.7) SD units. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several lipids associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. A subset was beneficially altered by a dietary fat intervention that supports the substitution of dietary saturated FAs with unsaturated FAs as a potential tool for primary disease prevention.",

Here, we show that mice fed a high-fat/low-fiber \"Western-type\" diet (WD) had dramatically increased mortality in a murine model of antibiotic-induced CDI compared to a low-fat/low-fiber (LF/LF) diet and standard mouse chow controls. We found that the WD had a pro- C. difficile bile acid composition that was driven in part by higher levels of primary bile acids that are produced to digest fat, and a lower level of secondary bile acids that are produced by the gut microbiome. This lack of secondary bile acids was associated with a greater disturbance to the gut microbiome with antibiotics in both the WD and LF/LF diet compared to mouse chow. Mice fed the WD also had the highest level of toxin TcdA just prior to the onset of mortality, but not of TcdB or increased inflammation. These findings indicate that dietary intervention to decrease fat may complement previously proposed dietary intervention strategies to prevent CDI in high-risk individuals.",

      "abstract": "Maternal health and diet can have important consequences for offspring nutrition and metabolic health. During lactation, signals are communicated from the mother to the infant through milk via macronutrients, hormones, and bioactive molecules. In this study we designed experiments to probe the mother-milk-infant triad in the condition of normal maternal health and upon exposure to high fat diet (HFD) with or without concurrent metformin exposure. We examined maternal characteristics, milk composition and offspring metabolic parameters on postnatal day 16, prior to offspring weaning. We found that lactational HFD increased maternal adipose tissue weight, mammary gland adipocyte size, and altered milk lipid composition causing a higher amount of omega-6 (n6) long chain fatty acids and lower omega-3 (n3). Offspring of HFD dams were heavier with more body fat during suckling. Metformin (Met) exposure decreased maternal blood glucose and several milk amino acids. Offspring of met dams were smaller during suckling. Gene expression in the lactating mammary glands was impacted to a greater extent by metformin than HFD, but both metformin and HFD altered genes related to muscle contraction, indicating that these genes may be more susceptible to lactational stressors. Our study demonstrates the impact of common maternal exposures during lactation on milk composition, mammary gland function and offspring growth with metformin having little capacity to rescue the offspring from the effects of a maternal HFD during lactation.",

Twenty-eight Holstein male calves, 274 ± 32 kg initial body weight, were used in a completely randomised design with a 2 × 2 factorial treatment arrangement for 100 d (with 10 d of adaptation). Seven animals were randomly allocated per treatment. Four dietary treatments were tested, which included: (1) diet supplemented with saturated fat (Energizer® RP10) at low level (diet with high barley and starch content), (2) diet supplemented with saturated fat at high level (diet with low barley and starch content), (3) diet supplemented with unsaturated fat (Persiafat) at low level (diet with high barley and starch content) and (4) diet supplemented with unsaturated fat at high level (diet with low barley and starch content). The dry matter intake, average daily gain, feed conversion ratio and carcass traits were not affected by supplemental fat sources and levels. Total tract digestibility of acid detergent fibre was improved after inclusion of both rumen-protected fat sources while other nutrient digestibilities were not affected by the fat sources or levels. In conclusion, partial replacing of dietary starch with fat supplements has not negative effects on calves' performance and digestibility of neutral detergent fibre.",

The prevalence of abdominal obesity, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidaemia, and high blood pressure among Brazilian adolescents is increasing and hence, early lifestyle interventions targeting these factors might be an effective strategy to prevent or slow the progression of T2D. METHODS: We aimed to assess the interaction between dietary and genetic factors on metabolic disease-related traits in 200 healthy Brazilian young adults. Dietary intake was assessed using 3-day food records. Ten metabolic disease-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to construct a metabolic-genetic risk score (metabolic-GRS). RESULTS: We found significant interactions between the metabolic-GRS and total fat intake on fasting insulin level (Pinteraction = 0.017), insulin-glucose ratio (Pinteraction = 0.010) and HOMA-B (Pinteraction = 0.002), respectively, in addition to a borderline GRS-fat intake interaction on HOMA-IR (Pinteraction = 0.051). Within the high-fat intake category [37.98 ± 3.39% of total energy intake (TEI)], individuals with ≥ 5 risk alleles had increased fasting insulin level (P = 0.021), insulin-glucose ratio (P = 0.010), HOMA-B (P = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.053) than those with < 5 risk alleles. CONCLUSION: Our study has demonstrated a novel GRS-fat intake interaction in young Brazilian adults, where individuals with higher genetic risk and fat intake had increased glucose and insulin-related traits than those with lower genetic risk. Large intervention and follow-up studies with an objective assessment of dietary factors are needed to confirm our findings.

      "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) report a higher frequency and severity of gastrointestinal disorders (GID) than typically developing (TD) children. GID-associated discomfort increases feelings of anxiety and frustration, contributing to the severity of ASD. Emerging evidence supports the biological intersection of neurodevelopment and microbiome, indicating the integral contribution of GM in the development and function of the nervous system, and mental health, and disease balance. Dysbiotic GM could be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of GID in children with ASD. High-fat diets may modulate GM through accelerated growth of bile-tolerant bacteria, altered bacterial ratios, and reduced bacterial diversity, which may increase the risk of GID. Notably, saturated fatty acids are considered to have a pronounced effect on the increase of bile-tolerant bacteria and reduction in microbial diversity. Additionally, omega-3 exerts a favorable impact on GM and gut health due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Despite inconsistencies in the data elaborated in the review, the dietary fat composition, as part of an overall dietary intervention, plays a role in modulating GID, specifically in ASD, due to the altered microbiome profile. This review emphasizes the need to conduct future experimental studies investigating the effect of diets with varying fatty acid compositions on GID-specific microbiome profiles in children with ASD.",

While interventions to avoid recurrences exist for the two most common causes - abstinence for alcoholic and cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis - the are no known preventive measures in idiopathic ARP. Though it is not included in any of the guidelines, a low-fat diet is often recommended. Our aim is to test dietary fat reduction's effect on AP recurrence in a randomized controlled setting, in order to provide high-quality evidence for the validity of such an intervention. METHODS, DESIGN: Participants with at least 2 episodes of AP in the preceding 2 years of which the last episode was idiopathic will be randomized to one of two diets with different fat contents: a 'reduced fat diet' (15% fat, 65% carbohydrate, 20% protein) and a 'standard healthy diet' (30% fat, 50% carbohydrate, 20% protein; based on WHO recommendations). Participants will be followed-up for 2 years (visits will be scheduled for months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24) during which they will receive a repeated session of nutritional guidance, complete food frequency questionnaires and data on relapse, mortality, BMI, cardiovascular parameters and serum lipid values will be collected. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the effect of modifying the dietary fat content on AP recurrence, mortality, serum lipids and weight loss in idiopathic cases.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups and provided each of the following diets: (1) high-fat diet (HFD), (2) HFD with perilla oil (PO), and (3) HFD with corn oil (CO). After 12 weeks of dietary intervention, the rats were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (5 mg/kg) from Escherichia coli O55:B5 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following LPS stimulation, serum insulin levels were increased, while PO and CO lowered the serum levels of glucose and insulin. In the liver, LPS increased the triglyceride levels, while PO and CO alleviated the LPS-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. In the LPS injected rats, the mRNA expression of genes related to inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was attenuated by PO and CO in the liver. Furthermore, hepatic levels of proteins involved in the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, antioxidant response, and ER stress were lowered by PO- and CO-replacement. Therefore, the partial replacement of dietary fat with PUFAs alleviates LPS-induced hepatic inflammation during HFD consumption, which may decrease metabolic abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To examine the relationship between dietary fat intake and breast cancer (BC) development. METHOD: This case-control study included 473 women with breast cancer (pathologically confirmed) and 501 healthy subjects matched by age and residency. Dietary intakes of different types and sources of fatty acids were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. The association between dietary fats and odds of BC was assessed using a logistic regression model in crude and multivariable-adjusted models. P values below 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS: Participants' age and body mass index were 44.0 ± 10.8 years and 28.4 ± 5.6 kg/m2, respectively. Individuals with the highest quartile of total fat intake and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake were 1.50 times more at risk to develop BC than others. A positive significant association was observed between animal fat (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 1.89, 95 % CI = 0.93-3.81), saturated fatty acid (SFA) (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 1.70, 95 % CI = 0.88-3.30), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 1.85, 95 % CI = 0.95-3.61) and PUFA intake (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 2.12, 95 % CI = 1.05-4.27) with BC risk in postmenopausal women. However, there was no association in premenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Total dietary fat and its subtypes might increase the risk of BC, especially in postmenopausal women. This observational study confirms the role of dietary fat in breast cancer development. Intervention studies involving different estrogen receptor subgroups are needed.",

METHODS: A systematic literature search of medical databases from 1995 to 2021 was undertaken. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials that reported at least one of the following glycaemic outcomes: mean glucose, area under the curve, time in range or hypoglycaemic episodes. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included. Thirteen studies gave additional insulin. Five studies gave an additional 30%-43% of the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) for 32-50 g of fat and 31%-51% ICR for 7-35 g of fat with 12-27 g of protein added to control meals. A further eight studies gave -28% to +75% ICR using algorithms based on fat and protein for meals with 19-50 g of carbohydrate, 2-79 g of fat and 10-60 g of protein, only one study reported a glycaemic benefit of giving less than an additional 24% ICR. Eight studies evaluated insulin delivery patterns. Four of six studies in pump therapy, and one of two studies in multiple daily injections showed the combination of bolus and split dose, respectively, were superior. Five studies examined the insulin dose split, four demonstrated 60%-125% ICR upfront was necessary. Two studies investigated the timing of insulin delivery, both reported administration 15 min before the meal lowered postprandial glycaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the glycaemic benefit of an additional 24%-75% ICR for fat and fat and protein meals. For these meals, there is supportive evidence for insulin delivery in a combination bolus with a minimum upfront dose of 60% ICR, 15 min before the meal.",

We analyzed the effects of restriction of high-fat diet (HFD) on weight loss, circulating gut hormone levels and expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides. Ten-week-old male Wistar rats (n = 40) were randomly distributed into four groups: two fed ad libitum a normal diet (ND) (N group) or a HFD (H group) and two subjected to a 25% caloric restriction of ND (NR group) or HFD (HR group) for 9 weeks. A 25% restriction of HFD over 9 weeks leads to a 36% weight loss with regard to the group fed HFD ad libitum accompanied by normal values in adiposity index and food efficiency ratio (FER). This restriction also carried the normalization of NPY, AgRP and POMC hypothalamic mRNA expression, without changes in CART. Caloric restriction did not succeed in improving glucose homeostasis but reduced HFD-induced hyperinsulinemia. In conclusion, 25% restriction of HFD reduced adiposity and improved metabolism in experimental obesity, without changes in glycemia. Restriction of the HFD triggered the normalization of hypothalamic NPY, AgRP and POMC expression, as well as ghrelin and leptin levels.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this review is to explore how metabolic changes induced by diets high in saturated fat (HFD) affect nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine neurotransmission and food intake, and to explore how stress and inflammation influence this process. Recent evidence linked diet-induced obesity and HFD with reduced dopamine release and reuptake. Altered dopamine neurotransmission could disrupt satiety circuits between NAc dopamine terminals and projections to the hypothalamus. The NAc directs learning and motivated behaviours based on homeostatic needs and psychological states. Therefore, impaired dopaminergic responses to palatable food could contribute to weight gain by disrupting responses to food cues or stress, which impacts type and quantity of food consumed. Specifically, saturated fat promotes neuronal resistance to anorectic hormones and activation of immune cells that release proinflammatory cytokines. Insulin has been shown to regulate dopamine neurotransmission by enhancing satiety, but less is known about effects of diet-induced stress. Therefore, changes to dopamine signalling due to HFD warrant further examination to characterise crosstalk of cytokines with endocrine and neurotransmitter signals. A HFD promotes a proinflammatory environment that may disrupt neuronal endocrine function and dopamine signalling that could be exacerbated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and κ-opioid receptor stress systems. Together, these adaptive changes may dysregulate eating by changing NAc dopamine during hedonic versus homeostatic food intake. This could drive palatable food cravings during energy restriction and hinder weight loss. Understanding links between HFD and dopamine neurotransmission will inform treatment strategies for diet-induced obesity and identify molecular candidates for targeted therapeutics.",

Massive clinical observations have indicated that high-fat/-calorie diet induced metabolic dysfunction along with alcohol intake deteriorates steatotic liver injury. To explore the potential mechanisms of fatty diet together with alcohol-induced steatohepatitis, we adopted a rat model by comparing a half-dose combination of fat diet (20%) and alcohol (10%) with their corresponding double dose of 40% fat diet and 20% alcohol for 8 weeks. The notable alterations in histopathology, acceleration in the oxidation parameters (ROS, NO and lipid peroxidation) and serum transaminase levels were shown in the concomitant group. Concomitant use of a high-fat diet and alcohol provoked hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress, but did not activate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis parameters compared to F. In contrast, the notable activation of caspase-12 and nuclear translocation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) were observed only in the combined treatment group. The concomitant dietary fat intake and alcohol consumption lead to liver injury initially and later to steatohepatitis by the overdose of fat or alcohol, and in which the CHOP and caspase-12 might be involved in synergistic acceleration of steatohepatitis through a mitochondria-independent manner."

Birds fed diets with 3 levels of fat, that is, low (LF), medium (MF), and high fat (HF) were reared from 22 to 42 wk of age. Jejunum tissue was collected at week 42 for gene expression analysis. Dietary fat content as ether extract, net energy to AME ratio, and CP content of 3 treatment groups were as follows: LF: 25, 0.735, 187 (g/kg, DM); MF: 61, 0.739, 185 (g/kg, DM); HF: 73, 0.752, 181 (g/kg, DM). The BW, fat pad weight (g), fat pad-to-BW ratio (%) was the same for all the treatments (P > 0·05). Birds fed a diet containing HF increased the AME daily intake per metabolic BW (BW0.75) (P < 0.05). The expression of jejunal PPARγ was increased in the birds fed MF than that fed LF (P < 0.05). Dietary fat level did not affect the expression of other genes: protein kinase AMP-activated noncatalytic subunit gamma 2, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2, succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase Rieske iron-sulfur polypeptide 1, cytochrome c oxidase subunit III, ATP synthase subunit alpha, avian adenine nucleotide translocator, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (P > 0·05). The mitochondrial count per cell showed no difference among the 3 groups with different dietary treatments (P > 0·05). The results suggest that PPARγ may be important to the energy expenditure during nutrient absorption, digestion, and metabolism, and respiratory chain complexes, and other genes involving mitochondrial energy metabolism and lipogenesis may be less responsive to dietary treatment.",

METHODS: We have undertaken a systematic review of fat intakes and cardiovascular disease risk in adults with type 2 diabetes using an online search strategy to 24 April 2020, augmented with hand searching. Searches, extraction, and risk of bias assessments were undertaken by two researchers. The quality of evidence was assessed with GRADE protocols. RESULTS: We identified five eligible prospective studies of 22,591 participants followed for on average 9.8 years, and one trial of 14 participants with type 2 diabetes. Limited data were available; however, replacement analyses of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat (RR for 2% energy replacement 0.87 95% CI: 0.77-0.99) or carbohydrate (RR for 5% energy replacement 0.82 95% CI: 0.67-1.00) was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease occurrence. Higher polyunsaturated: saturated fat intake was also associated with reduced cardiovascular disease occurrence (RR 0.75 95% CI: 0.57-0.98). The quality of evidence was low to very-low. CONCLUSION: Although only limited data were available, replacement of saturated fats with other macronutrients, such as polyunsaturated fats, was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease occurrence. Supporting evidence from research in the general population increases confidence in these findings. Until more data are available to better comment on dietary fat intakes in cardiovascular disease risk of those with type 2 diabetes, it appears appropriate that saturated fats be replaced in the diet with other macronutrients, such as polyunsaturated fats.",

      "abstract": "Excessive dietary fat intake has extensive impacts on several physiological systems and can lead to metabolic and nonmetabolic disease. In animal models of ingestion, exposure to a high fat diet during pregnancy predisposes offspring to increase intake of dietary fat and causes increase in weight gain that can lead to obesity, and without intervention, these physiological and behavioral consequences can persist for several generations. The hypothalamus is a region of the brain that responds to physiological hunger and fullness and contains orexigenic neuropeptide systems that have long been associated with dietary fat intake. The past fifteen years of research show that prenatal exposure to a high fat diet increases neurogenesis of these neuropeptide systems in offspring brain and are correlated to behavioral changes that induce a pro-consummatory and obesogenic phenotype. Current research has uncovered several potential molecular mechanisms by which excessive dietary fat alters the hypothalamus and involve dietary fatty acids, the immune system, gut microbiota, and transcriptional and epigenetic changes. This review will examine the current knowledge of dietary fat-associated changes in the hypothalamus and the potential pathways involved in modifying the development of orexigenic peptide neurons that lead to changes in ingestive behavior, with a special emphasis on inflammation by chemokines.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity and the metabolic syndrome are increasingly prevalent in society and their complications and response to treatment exhibit sexual dimorphism. Mouse models of high fat diet-induced obesity are commonly used for both mechanistic and therapeutic studies of metabolic disease and diabetes. However, the inclusion of female mammals in obesity research has not been a common practice, and has resulted in a paucity of data regarding the effect of sex on metabolic parameters and its applicability to humans. METHODS: Here we analyzed male and female C57BL/6 J mice beginning at 4 weeks of age that were placed on a low-fat diet (LFD, 10% calories from fat), a Western Diet (WD, 45% calories from fat), or a high fat diet (HFD, 60% calories from fat). Assessments of body composition, glucose homeostasis, insulin production, and energy metabolism, as well as histological analyses of pancreata were performed. RESULTS: Both male and female C57BL/6 J mice had similar increases in total percent body weight gain with both WD and HFD compared to LFD, however, male mice gained weight earlier upon HFD or WD feeding compared to female mice. Male mice maintained their caloric food intake while reducing their locomotor activity with either WD or HFD compared to LFD, whereas female mice increased their caloric food intake with WD feeding. Locomotor activity of female mice did not significantly change upon WD or HFD feeding, yet female mice exhibited increased energy expenditure compared to WD or HFD fed male mice. Glucose tolerance tests performed at 4, 12 and 20 weeks of dietary intervention revealed impaired glucose tolerance that was worse in male mice compared to females. Furthermore, male mice exhibited an increase in pancreatic β cell area as well as reduced insulin sensitivity after HFD feeding compared to WD or LFD, whereas female mice did not. CONCLUSIONS: Male and female C57BL/6 J mice exhibited strikingly different responses in weight, food consumption, locomotor activity, energy expenditure and β cell adaptation upon dietary manipulation, with the latter exhibiting less striking phenotypic changes. We conclude that the nature of these responses emphasizes the need to contextualize studies of obesity pathophysiology and treatment with respect to sex.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The Western diet that comprises high levels of long-chain saturated fats and sugar is associated not only with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes but also has been recently linked to brain changes and cognitive dysfunction. However, in animal studies, reported effects are variable, and the mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear. In the proposed review, we aim to summarise the diverse evidence of the effects of so-called 'high-fat' and ketogenic diets on behavioural measures of cognition in postweaning mice and rats, relative to animals on standard diets and to determine potential underlying mechanisms of high-fat diet-induced effects. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search strategy was designed to retrieve studies reporting use of a high-fat or ketogenic diet in postweaning mice and rats that included cognitive assessments. Three databases (Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Science) were searched and 4487 unique references were retrieved. SCREENING AND ANNOTATION: Studies were screened for inclusion by two independent reviewers, with 330 studies retained for analysis. Characteristics of disease model choice, experimental design, intervention use and outcome assessment are to be extracted using the Systematic Review Facility (http://syrf.org.uk/) tool. Studies will be assessed for study quality and risk of bias and confidence of mechanistic involvement. DATA MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING: For cognitive outcomes, effect sizes will be calculated using normalised mean difference and summarised using a random effects model. The contribution of potential sources of heterogeneity to the observed effects of diet on cognition will be assessed using multivariable meta-regression, with partitioning of heterogeneity as a sensitivity analysis. A preliminary version of this protocol was published on 9 April 2019 on the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies website (http://www.dcn.ed.ac.uk/camarades/research.html%23protocols). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required as there are no subjects in the proposed study."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of various dietary unsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratios (UFA to SFA ratios) on growth performance, carcass traits, blood lipid parameters, tissue fatty acid (FA) composition, and meat quality of finishing pigs. METHODS: A total of 45 crossbred pigs ([Duroc×Landrace]×Yorkshire), with an average initial body weight of 60.3±2.4 kg, were randomly allocated to three treatment groups of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 dietary UFA to SFA ratios. RESULTS: Both average daily gain and average daily feed intake of pigs were decreased linearly (p<0.05), whereas backfat thickness was decreased linearly (p<0.05) with increasing of dietary UFA to SFA ratio. Serum triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were decreased quadratically or linearly (p<0.05) respectively, whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased quadratically (p<0.05) with increasing dietary UFA to SFA ratio. In M. longissimus thoracis, the proportion of C18:1 and monounsaturated FA was decreased linearly (p<0.05), whereas the proportion of C18:2n-6, C20:4n-6 and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were increased linearly (p<0.05) as dietary UFA to SFA ratio increased. In the subcutaneous adipose tissue, the proportion of SFA was decreased linearly (p<0.05), whereas the proportion of n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA, and the UFA to SFA ratios were increased linearly (p<0.05) with increasing of dietary UFA to SFA ratio. Meat color scores and shear force of pigs were decreased linearly (p<0.05), whereas drip loss and cooking loss were increased linearly (p<0.05) with increasing of dietary UFA to SFA ratio. CONCLUSION: Appropriately boosted dietary UFA to SFA ratio could be conductive to optimize blood lipid parameters and tissue FA composition. However, when the ratio is too high or too low it tends to have negative effects on growth performance and meat quality."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the association between dietary fat intake and risk of uterine fibroids; and to evaluate the association between erythrocyte membrane fatty acid (FA) levels and fibroid risk. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI). In a subset of participants 34 individual FAs were measured and logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI for the association between FA tertiles and fibroids. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Premenopausal US women (81,590) in the Nurses' Health Study II, aged 25-42 years at enrollment in 1989 for whom diet was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. A total of 553 participants with erythrocyte FA measurements. INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cases of fibroids were defined on the basis of self-reported ultrasound or hysterectomy confirmation. RESULT(S): A total of 8,142 cases of ultrasound-confirmed or hysterectomy-confirmed were diagnosed during an 18-year period (1991-2009). No associations were observed between intake of any dietary fats and fibroids in the multivariable models. However, when erythrocyte FAs were examined, an inverse association was observed between total n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and likelihood of fibroids (OR for third versus first tertile, 0.41; 95% CI 0.19-0.89). In addition, total trans FAs were associated with more odds of fibroids (OR for third tertile, 3.33; 95% CI 1.50-7.38). CONCLUSION(S): Our findings provide preliminary suggestions that n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and trans FAs may play a role in fibroid etiology; however, these results should be confirmed in future studies.",

      "abstract": "A high-fat diet (HFD) induces changes in gut microbiota leading to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, and obesity, as a consequence of overnutrition, exacerbates inflammation, a known risk factor not only for cancer. However, experimental data showed that the composition of dietary fat has a greater impact on the pathogenesis of cancer than the total fat content in isocaloric diets. Similarly, human studies did not prove that a decrease in total fat intake is an effective strategy to combat cancer. Saturated fat has long been considered as harmful, but the current consensus is that moderate intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), including palmitic acid (PA), does not pose a health risk within a balanced diet. In regard to monounsaturated fat, plant sources are recommended. The consumption of plant monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly from olive oil, has been associated with lower cancer risk. Similarly, the replacement of animal MUFAs with plant MUFAs decreased cancer mortality. The impact of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on cancer risk depends on the ratio between ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs. In vivo data showed stimulatory effects of ω-6 PUFAs on tumour growth while ω-3 PUFAs were protective, but the results of human studies were not as promising as indicated in preclinical reports. As for trans FAs (TFAs), experimental data mostly showed opposite effects of industrially produced and natural TFAs, with the latter being protective against cancer progression, but human data are mixed, and no clear conclusion can be made. Further studies are warranted to establish the role of FAs in the control of cell growth in order to find an effective strategy for cancer prevention/treatment.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability which may cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Besides certain essential symptoms, a lot of ASD individuals also suffer the comorbidity of gut microbiota dysbiosis, which possibly causes a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) difficulties. Interestingly, evidence has indicated that behavioral output may be modulated through the communication between the central nervous system and gut microbiota via the gut-brain axis. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and n-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are structurally and functionally crucial components for the brain, and the state of n-3 PUFAs also affects the gut microbiota. However, how varying intake ratios of n-3/n6 PUFAs affect the gut microbiota composition in ASDs is not well-understood. Pregnant female Wistar rats with intraperitoneal administration of valproate acid (VPA) at embryonic day (E) 12.5 and their male offspring were grouped and fed three diets: a control chow (VPA group), omega-3 deficient (A group), and n-3/n6 (1:5) diet (B group). The diet of pregnant female Wistar rats with intraperitoneal administration of saline and their male offspring was a control chow (normal group). Microbial composition and species abundance were investigated accordingly by the 16S rRNA gene-based metagenomics analysis on the fecal samples. Results showed that fecal microbial abundance was decreased because of VPA administration in the period of pregnancy, and the changing pattern of gut microbiota was similar to that reported in ASD patients. Furthermore, the n-3/n6 (1:5) diet increased the fecal microbial abundance and decreased the elevated Firmicutes. In conclusion, n-3/n6 PUFAs (1:5) diet supplementation may alter gut microbiota composition in VPA-exposed rats. This study put forward a new strategy for the intervention and treatment of autism by n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio supplementation intakes."

      "abstract": "Recent advances in the field of taste physiology have clarified the role of different basic taste modalities and their implications in health and disease and proposed emphatically that there might be a distinct cue for oro-sensory detection of dietary long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Hence, fat taste can be categorized as a taste modality. During mastication, LCFAs activate tongue lipid sensors like CD36 and GPR120 triggering identical signaling pathways as the basic taste qualities do; however, the physico-chemical perception of fat is not as distinct as sweet or bitter or other taste sensations. The question arises whether \"fat taste\" is a basic or \"alimentary\" taste. There is compelling evidence that fat-rich dietary intervention modulates fat taste perception where an increase or a decrease in lipid contents in the diet results, respectively, in downregulation or upregulation of fat taste sensitivity. Evidently, a decrease in oro-sensory detection of LCFAs leads to high fat intake and, consequently, to obesity. In this article, we discuss recent relevant advances made in the field of fat taste physiology with regard to dietary fat preference and lipid sensors that can be the target of anti-obesity strategies.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We investigated whether autonomous motivation and self-efficacy might mediate the association between a lifestyle behavior intervention and dietary fat intake in low-income overweight or obese women with young children. METHODS: Participants were randomized to an intervention or comparison group. Intervention participants received a 16-week intervention aimed to prevent weight gain through promotion of stress management, healthy eating and physical activity. During the intervention phase, participants viewed a designated video lesson at home and dialed in a peer support group teleconference every week (weeks 1-4) then every other week (weeks 5-16). Potential mediation effects were analyzed using sequential mixed-effects linear models and path analysis. RESULTS: The intervention led to increased autonomous motivation (β = 0.34, standard error [SE] = 0.15, P = 0.005), which subsequently increased self-efficacy (β = 0.18, SE = 0.35, P < 0.001), and higher levels of self-efficacy were associated with decreased dietary fat intake (β = -0.22, SE = 0.28, P < 0.001). In other words, autonomous motivation and self-efficacy mediated the association between the lifestyle behavior intervention and dietary fat intake. CONCLUSION: To decrease dietary fat intake for low-income overweight or obese women with young children, strategies, such as those promoting peer encouragement, may be warranted in interventions to enhance autonomous motivation and/or practical skills for increasing self-efficacy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although diet response prediction for cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs) has been demonstrated using single genetic variants and main-effect genetic risk scores, little investigation has gone into the development of genome-wide diet response scores. OBJECTIVE: We sought to leverage the multistudy setup of the Women's Health Initiative cohort to generate and test genetic scores for the response of 6 CRFs (BMI, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose) to dietary fat. METHODS: A genome-wide interaction study was undertaken for each CRF in women (n ∼ 9000) not participating in the dietary modification (DM) trial, which focused on the reduction of dietary fat. Genetic scores based on these analyses were developed using a pruning-and-thresholding approach and tested for the prediction of 1-y CRF changes as well as long-term chronic disease development in DM trial participants (n ∼ 5000). RESULTS: Only 1 of these genetic scores, for LDL cholesterol, predicted changes in the associated CRF. This 1760-variant score explained 3.7% (95% CI: 0.09, 11.9) of the variance in 1-y LDL cholesterol changes in the intervention arm but was unassociated with changes in the control arm. In contrast, a main-effect genetic risk score for LDL cholesterol was not useful for predicting dietary fat response. Further investigation of this score with respect to downstream disease outcomes revealed suggestive differential associations across DM trial arms, especially with respect to coronary heart disease and stroke subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results lay the foundation for the combination of many genome-wide gene-diet interactions for diet response prediction while highlighting the need for further research and larger samples in order to achieve robust biomarkers for use in personalized nutrition.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary fat can overcome CLA inhibition of milk fat concentration in lactating mice. Wild type C57Bl/6J mice (n = 31) were fed semipurified diets containing either low fat (LF; 4% fat) or high fat (HF; 23.6% fat) starting 4-6 days postpartum. Dietary fat was increased by inclusion of high oleic sunflower oil. After 2 days on the experimental diets, lactating dams were orally dosed with either water (control) or trans-10, cis-12 CLA (20 mg/day) for 5 days. CLA treatment decreased pup growth similarly in both HF and LF diets. Milk fat percent was increased over 16% by the HF diet and decreased over 12% by CLA, but there was no interaction of dietary fat and CLA. Both CLA and the HF diet reduced the proportion of short- and medium-chain fatty acids that originate from de novo synthesis, and there was no interaction of diet and CLA. CLA had no effect on the percent of preformed fatty acids, but the HF diet increased their abundance. Dietary fat and CLA both modified mammary expression of lipogenic enzymes and regulators, but no interactions were observed. In conclusion, CLA reduced milk fat concentration and litter growth, but these effects were not overcome by increased dietary fat from high oleic sunflower oil. CLA inhibition of milk fat in the mammary gland is not substrate dependent, and the mechanism is independent from dietary supply of oleic acid.",

Sixty Landrace × Yorkshire sows were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments supplemented with 3% soybean oil (SO), 3% coconut oil (CO) or 3% fish oil (FO), respectively, from Day 90 of gestation until parturition. On Day 112 of gestation, half the sows from each dietary treatment were challenged with LPS (10 μg/kg BW) or saline. The results showed that maternal LPS challenge decreased colostrum yield and dry matter content. A similar pattern of changes was observed for body weight gain and colostrum intake in piglets from LPS-challenged sows. Maternal LPS challenge increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 1β (IL1β) and IL6 in colostum, and the mRNA abundance of IL6, IL1β and TNFα and the phosphorylation level of p65 in mammary glands. However, the responses of these variables to LPS treatment were lower in sows fed a FO diet. In conclusion, maternal immune challenge reduced the growth performance of piglets by decreasing colostrum yield and intake by piglets, and dietary supplementation with FO in sows attenuates the LPS-induced inflammatory response in mammary glands."

      "abstract": "The global prevalence of obesity and obesity-associated cardiometabolic diseases is a significant public health burden. Chronic low-grade inflammation in metabolic tissues such as white adipose tissue (WAT) is linked to obesity and may play a role in disease progression. The overconsumption of dietary fat has been suggested to modulate the WAT inflammatory environment. It is also recognised that fats varying in degree of fatty acid saturation may elicit differential WAT inflammatory responses. This information has originated predominantly from animal or cell models and translation into human participants in vivo remains limited. This review will summarise human intervention studies investigating the effect of dietary fat quantity and quality on subcutaneous WAT inflammation, with a specific focus on the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB and nucleotide-binding and oligomerisation domain-like receptor, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome molecular signalling pathways. Overall, firm conclusions are hard to draw regarding the effect of dietary fat quantity and quality on WAT inflammatory responses due to the heterogeneity of study designs, diet composition and participant cohorts recruited. Previous studies have predominantly focused on measures of WAT gene expression. It is suggested that future work includes measures of WAT total content and phosphorylation of proteins involved in TLR4/NF-κB and NLRP3 signalling as this is more representative of alterations in WAT physiological function. Understanding pathways linking the intake of total fat and specific fatty acids with WAT metabolic-inflammatory responses may have important implications for public health by informing dietary guidelines aimed at cardiometabolic risk reduction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast milk is uniquely designed for the infant and contains the key nutrients and bioactive factors required to support optimal infant health and development. While previous studies have reported that maternal obesity can influence milk composition, whether this relationship is driven by maternal or dietary factors remains unclear. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of test meals varying in fat and sugar content on post-prandial concentrations of macronutrients and metabolic hormones in the breast milk. METHODS: This open label crossover study will include 25 lactating women. On the three days of the intervention, women will be randomized to receive a breakfast meal with a fat and sugar content consistent with the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (9 g fat, 25 g of sugar) or a breakfast meal containing higher levels of fat (28 g fat, 18 g of sugar) or sugar (5 g fat, 56 g of sugar). All breakfast meals will be similar in composition (cereal, milk, yogurt, toast and spread) and matched for total energy content. This study will measure breast milk concentrations of metabolic hormones (leptin, insulin, adiponectin, ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1) and macronutrients in the following 12 hours. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results of this study will provide novel direct evidence of the impact of variations in dietary fat and sugar content to alter the macronutrient and/or metabolic hormone concentrations in breast milk. Data on the effect of maternal diet on milk composition is critical given the established importance of nutritional exposures in early infancy for an individual's life-long health outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. Validated biomarkers enhance efforts for early detection and treatment, which reduce the risk of mortality. Epigenetic signatures have been suggested as good biomarkers for early detection, prognosis and targeted therapy of BC. Here, we highlight studies documenting the modifying effects of dietary fatty acids and obesity on BC biomarkers associated with DNA methylation. We focus our analysis on changes elicited in writers of DNA methylation (i.e., DNA methyltransferases), global DNA methylation and gene-specific DNA methylation. To provide context, we precede this discussion with a review of the available evidence for an association between BC incidence and both dietary fat consumption and obesity. We also include a review of well-vetted BC biomarkers related to cytosine-guanine dinucleotides methylation and how they influence BC risk, prognosis, tumour characteristics and response to treatment.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is a GPCR expressed widely in the brain as well as in peripheral metabolic organs. Although pharmacological blockade of CB1R has been effective for the treatment of obesity and tobacco addiction, precise distribution of CB1R within the brain and potential changes by obesity or nicotine exposure have not been thoroughly addressed. METHODS: To examine CB1R distribution within the central energy center, we performed immunostaining and qPCR analysis of micro-dissected hypothalamic nuclei from male C57BL/6 mice. To address the effect of nicotine on food intake and body weight, and on potential changes of CB1R levels in the hypothalamus, mice kept on a high fat diet (HFD) for four weeks were challenged with nicotine intraperitoneally. RESULTS: Validity of the micro-dissected samples was confirmed by the expression of established nucleus-enriched genes. The expression levels of CB1R in the arcuate and lateral nuclei of the hypothalamus were higher than paraventricular and ventral-dorsal medial nuclei. Nicotine administration led to a significant suppression of food intake and body weight either under standard or high fat diet. Neither HFD nor nicotine alone altered CB1R levels in any nucleus tested. By contrast, treatment of HFD-fed mice with nicotine led to a significant increase in CB1R levels in the arcuate, paraventricular and lateral nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: CB1R was widely distributed in multiple hypothalamic nuclei. The expression of CB1R was augmented only when mice were treated with HFD and nicotine in combination. These data suggest that the exposure to nicotine may provoke an enhanced endocannabinoid response in diet-induced obesity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The American Diabetes Association recommends individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) adjust insulin for dietary fat; however, optimal adjustments are not known. This study aimed to determine 1) the relationship between the amount and type of dietary fat and glycemia and 2) the optimal insulin adjustments for dietary fat. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with T1D using insulin pump therapy attended the research clinic on 9-12 occasions. On the first six visits, participants consumed meals containing 45 g carbohydrate with 0 g, 20 g, 40 g, or 60 g fat and either saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fat. Insulin was dosed using individual insulin/carbohydrate ratio as a dual-wave 50/50% over 2 h. On subsequent visits, participants repeated the 20-60-g fat meals with the insulin dose estimated using a model predictive bolus, up to twice per meal, until glycemic control was achieved. RESULTS: With the same insulin dose, increasing the amount of fat resulted in a significant dose-dependent reduction in incremental area under the curve for glucose (iAUCglucose) in the early postprandial period (0-2 h; P = 0.008) and increase in iAUCglucose in the late postprandial period (2-5 h; P = 0.004). The type of fat made no significant difference to the 5-h iAUCglucose. To achieve glycemic control, on average participants required dual-wave insulin bolus: for 20 g fat, +6% insulin, 74/26% over 73 min; 40 g fat, +6% insulin, 63/37% over 75 min; and 60 g fat, +21% insulin, 49/51% over 105 min. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides clinical guidance for mealtime insulin dosing recommendations for dietary fat in T1D.",

The optimal diet for the treatment of metabolic syndrome is not clear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of dietary interventions in volunteers with metabolic syndrome as well as studies examining the impact of dietary fat on the separate components of metabolic syndrome was undertaken using only recent meta-analyses, if available. RESULTS: Most of the data suggest that replacing carbohydrates with any fat, but particularly polyunsaturated fat, will lower triglyceride(TG), increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and lower blood pressure, but have no effects on fasting glucose in normal volunteers or insulin sensitivity, as assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps. Fasting insulin may be lowered by fat. Monounsaturated fat (MUFA) is preferable to polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) for fasting insulin and glucose lowering. The addition of 3-4 g of N3 fats will lower TG and blood pressure (BP) and reduce the proportion of subjects with metabolic syndrome. Dairy fat (50% saturated fat) is also related to a lower incidence of metabolic syndrome in cohort studies.",

Whether the lipid response to dietary fat differs between normal-weight and obese persons is of relevance to dietary recommendations for obese populations. OBJECTIVES: We compared the effect of substituting unsaturated fat for saturated fat on LDL cholesterol and apoB concentrations in normal-weight (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2) and obese (BMI: 30-45) subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol. METHODS: We randomly assigned 83 men and women (aged 21-70 y) stratified by BMI (normal: n = 44; obese: n = 39) and elevated LDL cholesterol (mean ± SD, normal weight 4.6 ± 0.9 mmol/L; obese 4.4 ± 0.8 mmol/L) to either a PUFA diet enriched with oil-based margarine ( n = 42) or an SFA diet enriched with butter (n = 41) for 6 wk. RESULTS: Seven-day dietary records showed differences of ∼9 energy percent (E%) in SFA and ∼4 E% in PUFA between the SFA and PUFA groups. In the total study population, the PUFA diet compared with the SFA diet lowered LDL cholesterol (-0.31 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.15 mmol/L, compared with 0.32 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.47 mmol/L; P < 0.001) and apoB (-0.08 g/L; 95% CI: -0.11, -0.05 g/L, compared with 0.07 g/L; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.10 g/L; P < 0.001). Tests of the BMI × diet interaction were significant for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoB ( P values ≤ 0.009). In normal-weight compared with obese participants post-hoc comparisons found that the respective changes in LDL cholesterol were 9.7% (95% CI: 5.3%, 14.2%) compared with 5.3% (95% CI: -0.7%, 11.2%), P = 0.206, in the SFA group, and -10.4% (95% CI: -15.2%, -5.7%) compared with -2.3% (95% CI: -7.4%, 2.8%), P = 0.020, in the PUFA group. ApoB changes were 7.5% (95% CI: 3.5%, 11.4%) compared with 3.0% (95% CI: -1.7%, 7.7%), P = 0.140, in the SFA group, and -8.9% (95% CI: -12.6%, -5.2%) compared with -3.8% (95% CI: -6.3%, -1.2%), P = 0.021, in the PUFA group. Responses to dietary fat were not associated with changes in polyprotein convertase subtisilin/kexin type 9 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: BMI modifies the effect of PUFAs compared with SFAs, with smaller improvements in atherogenic lipid concentrations in obese than in normal-weight individuals, possibly supporting adjustment of dietary recommendations according to BMI.

We study the effect of this SNP on cardiovascular risk factors and weight loss secondary to 2hypocaloric diets. METHODS: 361 obese subjects were randomly allocated during 3 months (Diet M - high monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet vs. Diet P - high polyunsaturated fat hypocaloric diet). Anthropometric parameters, fasting blood glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin concentration, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile and adipocytokines levels were measured. Genotype of MTNR1B gene polymorphism (rs10830963) was evaluated. RESULTS: All anthropometric parameters, systolic blood pressure and leptin levels decreased in all subjects after both diets. This improvement of anthropometric parameters was higher in non G allele carriers than G allele carriers. After dietary intervention with Diet M, (CC vs. CG + GG); total cholesterol (delta: -10.4 ± 2.1mg/dl vs. -6.4 ± 1.2mg/dl: P <.05), LDL-cholesterol (delta:-7.1 ± 0.9mg/dl vs. -2.8 ± 0.8mg/dl: P <.05), insulin (delta:-3.0 ± 0.8 UI/L vs. -2.0 ± 1.0 UI/L: P<.05) and HOMA-IR (delta:-3.4 ± 1.0 units vs. -2.9 ± 0.9 units: P<.05) improved in no G allele carriers. After Diet P, in the group of subjects without G allele CC, insulin levels (delta: -2.9 ± 1.0 UI/L vs. -0.6 ± 0.2 UI/L: P <.05) and HOMA-IR (delta (CC vs. CG + GG): -0.8 ± 0.2 units vs. -0.4 ± 0.3 units: P <.05) decreased, too.

Dietary fat modification may improve insulin sensitivity, whereas the effect on insulin secretion is unclear. We investigated the effect of dietary fat modification on insulin secretion in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. Design In a 12-week pan-European parallel, randomized controlled dietary intervention trial (LIPGENE), 486 subjects were assigned to four isoenergetic diets: high-fat diets rich in saturated fat (HSFA) or monounsaturated fat (HMUFA) or low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets with (LFHCC n-3) or without (LFHCC control) 1.2 g/day of n-3 PUFA supplementation. Insulin secretion was estimated as acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) and disposition index (DI), modeled from an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Results There were no overall effect of the dietary intervention on AIRg and DI in the total cohort, in neither the high-fat nor LFHCC groups. We observed significant diet*fasting glucose category interactions for AIRg (P = 0.021) and DI (P = 0.001) in the high-fat groups. In subjects with normal fasting glucose and preserved first phase insulin secretion, the HMUFA diet increased, whereas the HSFA diet reduced AIRg (P = 0.015) and DI (P = 0.010). Conclusions The effects of dietary fat modification on insulin secretion were minor, and only evident in normoglycemic subjects. In this case, the HMUFA diet improved AIRg and DI, as compared to the HSFA diet.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether diets differing in fat content alter the gut microbiota and faecal metabolomic profiles, and to determine their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy adults whose diet is in a transition from a traditional low-fat diet to a diet high in fat and reduced in carbohydrate. METHODS: In a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial, 217 healthy young adults (aged 18-35 years; body mass index <28 kg/m2; 52% women) who completed the whole trial were included. All the foods were provided during the intervention period. The three isocaloric diets were: a lower-fat diet (fat 20% energy), a moderate-fat diet (fat 30% energy) and a higher-fat diet (fat 40% energy). The effects of the dietary interventions on the gut microbiota, faecal metabolomics and plasma inflammatory factors were investigated. RESULTS: The lower-fat diet was associated with increased α-diversity assessed by the Shannon index (p=0.03), increased abundance of Blautia (p=0.007) and Faecalibacterium (p=0.04), whereas the higher-fat diet was associated with increased Alistipes (p=0.04), Bacteroides (p<0.001) and decreased Faecalibacterium (p=0.04). The concentration of total short-chain fatty acids was significantly decreased in the higher-fat diet group in comparison with the other groups (p<0.001). The cometabolites p-cresol and indole, known to be associated with host metabolic disorders, were decreased in the lower-fat diet group. In addition, the higher-fat diet was associated with faecal enrichment in arachidonic acid and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway as well as elevated plasma proinflammatory factors after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Higher-fat consumption by healthy young adults whose diet is in a state of nutrition transition appeared to be associated with unfavourable changes in gut microbiota, faecal metabolomic profiles and plasma proinﬂammatory factors, which might confer adverse consequences for long-term health outcomes.

      "abstract": "Diets that contain high proportions of either wheat or supplementary fat have been individually reported to reduce enteric methane production. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of dietary fat supplementation on methane emissions and milk yield from cows fed diets containing either corn or wheat grains. It was hypothesized that cows fed a diet containing wheat would produce less methane and have lower methane yield (methane per kg of dry matter intake; MY) than cows fed a diet containing corn and that methane mitigation from fat supplementation would occur irrespective of the type of grain in the basal diet. The experiment involved 32 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows allocated to 1 of 4 treatment groups (n = 8) and individually fed different diets restricted to approximately 90% of their mean ad libitum intake measured during a covariate period. All animals were offered 11.5 kg of dry matter/d of alfalfa hay, 1.8 kg of dry matter/d of solvent-extracted canola meal, and 1 of 4 dietary supplements. Dietary supplements were 8 kg of dry matter/d of either corn or wheat, or these same treatments with the addition of 0.8 kg of canola oil. In this 5-wk experiment, d 1 to 7 served as the covariate period, d 8 to 14 as the transition period, d 15 to 28 as the adaptation period, and d 29 to 35 as the experimental period. Cows were fed their full treatment diets from d 15 to 35 during which time milk production and feed intake were measured daily. During d 29 to 35, methane production was measured for individual cows daily using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer method. The resulting averages for milk production and feed intake were analyzed by analysis of covariance with factorial grain by fat as treatment structure, animal as the unit within blocks, and the corresponding milk production or feed intake covariate averages as principal covariate. Data on milk fatty acids, ruminal fluid data on pH, ammonia, volatile fatty acids, protozoa, and methane were analyzed by ANOVA using the same treatment and blocking structures excluding the principal covariate. Cows fed a diet containing wheat had greater MY than cows fed a diet containing corn. Irrespective of the type of grain in the diet, increasing the fat concentration from 2 to 6% dry matter reduced MY. It is concluded that the grain component in the basal diet does not affect the mitigating effects of dietary fat supplements on MY.",

      "abstract": "Aquatic organisms, including important cultured species, are forced to contend with acute changes in water temperature as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events worsen. Acute temperature spikes are likely to threaten aquaculture species, but dietary intervention may play an important protective role. Increasing the concentration of macronutrients, for example dietary fat content, may improve the thermal resilience of aquaculture species, however, this remains unexplored. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used two commercially available diets (20% versus 10% crude fat) to examine if dietary fat content improves the growth performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) while increasing their resilience to acute thermal stress. Fish were fed their assigned diets for 28-days before assessing the upper thermal tolerance (CTMAX) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (UCRIT) and metabolism. We found that feeding fish a high fat diet resulted in heavier fish, but did not affect the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance or metabolism over an 18 °C temperature range (from 20 to 38 °C). Thermal tolerance was compromised in fish fed the high fat diet by 0.48 °C, showing significantly lower CTMAX. Together, these results suggest that while a high fat diet increases juvenile L. calcarifer growth, it does not benefit physiological performance across a range of relevant water temperatures and may even reduce fish tolerance of extreme water temperatures. These data may have implications for aquaculture production in a warming world, where episodic extremes of temperature are likely to become more frequent.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged intervention studies investigating molecular metabolism are necessary for a deeper understanding of dietary effects on health. Here we provide mechanistic information about metabolic adaptation to fat-rich diets. Healthy, slightly overweight men ingested saturated or polyunsaturated fat-rich diets for 6 weeks during weight maintenance. Hyperinsulinemic clamps combined with leg balance technique revealed unchanged peripheral insulin sensitivity, independent of fatty acid type. Both diets increased fat oxidation potential in muscle. Hepatic insulin clearance increased, while glucose production, de novo lipogenesis, and plasma triacylglycerol decreased. High fat intake changed the plasma proteome in the immune-supporting direction and the gut microbiome displayed changes at taxonomical and functional level with polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). In mice, eucaloric feeding of human PUFA and saturated fatty acid diets lowered hepatic triacylglycerol content compared with low-fat-fed control mice, and induced adaptations in the liver supportive of decreased gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Intake of fat-rich diets thus induces extensive metabolic adaptations enabling disposition of dietary fat without metabolic complications.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is one of the most significant risk factors for knee osteoarthritis. However, therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat obesity-associated osteoarthritis are limited because of uncertainty about the etiology of disease, particularly with regard to metabolic factors. High-fat-diet-induced obese mice have become a widely used model for testing hypotheses about how obesity increases the risk of osteoarthritis, but progress has been limited by variation in disease severity, with some reports concluding that dietary treatment alone is insufficient to induce osteoarthritis in mice. We hypothesized that increased sucrose content of typical low-fat control diets contributes to osteoarthritis pathology and thus alters outcomes when evaluating the effects of a high-fat diet. We tested this hypothesis in male C57BL/6J mice by comparing the effects of purified diets that independently varied sucrose or fat content from 6 to 26 weeks of age. Outcomes included osteoarthritis pathology, serum metabolites, and cartilage gene and protein changes associated with cellular metabolism and stress-response pathways. We found that the relative content of sucrose versus cornstarch in low-fat iso-caloric purified diets caused substantial differences in serum metabolites, joint pathology, and cartilage metabolic and stress-response pathways, despite no differences in body mass or body fat. We also found that higher dietary fat increased fatty acid metabolic enzymes in cartilage. The findings indicate that the choice of control diets should be carefully considered in mouse osteoarthritis studies. Our study also indicates that altered cartilage metabolism might be a contributing factor to how diet and obesity increase the risk of osteoarthritis.",

      "abstract": "The gastrointestinal peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) is released from the duodenum in response to dietary fat to aid in digestion, and plasma CCK levels are elevated with the consumption of high-fat diets. CCK is also a trophic peptide for the pancreas and has also been shown to stimulate growth of pancreatic cancer. In the current investigation, we studied the influence of a diet high in saturated fat on the growth of pancreatic cancer in syngeneic murine models before the mice became obese to exclude the confounding factors associated with obesity. The high-fat diet significantly increased growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancer compared with the control diet, and the stimulatory effect was blocked by the CCK-receptor antagonist proglumide. We then selectively knocked out the CCK receptor on the pancreatic cancer cells using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technology and showed that without CCK-receptors, dietary fat was unable to stimulate cancer growth. We next demonstrated that dietary fat failed to influence pancreatic cancer xenograft growth in genetically engineered CCK peptide knockout mice. The tumor-associated fibrosis that is so prevalent in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment was significantly decreased with CCK-receptor antagonist therapy because fibroblasts also have CCK receptors. The CCK-receptor antagonist proglumide also altered tumor metalloprotease expression and increased tumor suppressor genes by a PCR array. Our studies confirm that a diet high in saturated fat promotes growth of pancreatic cancer and the action is mediated by the CCK-receptor pathway. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Diets high in long-chain saturated fats promote growth of pancreatic cancer independent of obesity. The mechanism through which dietary fat promotes cancer is mediated through the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor pathway. Therapy with a CCK-receptor antagonist altered the tumor microenvironment by reducing fibrosis, increasing cluster of differentiation 8+ lymphocytes, increasing tumor suppressor genes, and thus decreasing metastases. Use of CCK-receptor antagonist therapy with standard chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer may improve response by altering the tumor microenvironment.",

Steers (n = 256) were fed for 134 d on either a corn, 40% full-fat MDGS, 40% de-oiled MDGS, or 38% de-oiled MDGS plus 2% corn oil diet. Twenty-four United States Department of Agriculture Choice carcasses (3 head/pen) were randomly selected within each dietary treatment and strip loins were collected and aged for 2, 9, 16, or 23 d. Steaks from each aging period were placed under retail display (RD) conditions for 0, 4, and 7 d. Stearic acid was predominant (C18:0; P = 0.03) in beef from the de-oiled MDGS plus oil treatment in comparison with all other dietary treatments. Feeding MDGS increased linoleic acid (C18:2; P < 0.01) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; P = 0.01) in comparison to the corn diet. The de-oiled MDGS plus oil group had greater C18:3 content (P = 0.03) when compared to corn, but no differences were observed between all other diets. There were no differences among dietary treatments for L* (P = 0.74) and b* (P = 0.25) values. The de-oiled MDGS group had lower a* values than all other treatments (P < 0.01) at day 5 of RD. The corn treatment had greater a* values (P ≤ 0.05) than de-oiled MDGS and de-oiled MDGS plus oil at day 6 and 7 of RD. Strip loin steaks from cattle fed full-fat MDGS tended to have lower a* values (P = 0.10) than steaks from cattle fed corn at day 7 of RD. Feeding de-oiled MDGS resulted in greater discoloration (P ≤ 0.05) at days 5, 6, and 7 of RD when compared to corn. Steaks from the de-oiled MDGS plus oil and full-fat MDGS groups had greater discoloration scores at day 7 of RD in comparison to corn (P ≤ 0.05). Strip loin steaks from cattle fed corn tended to have lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) values (P ≤ 0.10) in comparison to de-oiled MDGS and de-oiled MDGS plus oil at day 7 of RD. Results suggest that feeding MDGS to cattle reduces color and lipid stability in addition to increasing C18:2 and PUFA content of beef. Addition of corn oil to de-oiled MDGS decreased redness and increased discoloration and lipid oxidation in comparison to corn diets.",

Herbacetin is a dietary flavonoid that has been explored for many pharmacological activities; but, the anti-hyperglycaemic and anti-hyperlipidemic properties of herbacetin have not yet been explored. The present study was performed to evaluate the ameliorative effect of herbacetin on high-fat diet-induced hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidemia in 57BL/6 J mice. Obesity associated insulin resistance was induced by continuously feeding the mice with high-fat diet for 10 weeks. Afterwards, mice were subjected to intragastric administration of herbacetin (different doses) daily along with high-fat diet for the next 5 weeks. At the end of 106th day, changes in body weight, blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and lipids profiles and lipid-regulating enzymes were evaluated. Herbacetin significantly reduced the body weight, plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and HOMA-IR activity in obesity associated insulin resistant mice (OIR). In addition, herbacetin administration significantly reduced the plasma and hepatic total cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids in OIR mice. Moreover, herbacetin significantly improved the altered hepatic lipid metabolizing and lipid-regulating enzymes such as SREBP-1c, and 2, fatty acid synthase (FAS), fatty acid β-oxidation (β-oxidation), malic enzyme, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) when compared to OIR control mice. Histopathological examination clearly showed that herbacetin decreases lipid droplets in the liver tissue. Thus, observed results strongly indicate that herbacetin provides remarkable protection against the harmful effects of chronic high-fat diet consumption because of its anti-hyperglycaemic and anti-hyperlipidemic properties through the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolizing and lipid-regulating enzymes.",

Male six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were assigned into an ad libitum fed control diet (CON) and a high fat diet (HIGH). Within each diet group, subgroups of mice were treated with vehicle (VEH) or propranolol, a β-adrenergic antagonist (BB). Over 12 weeks, body weight gain observed in HIGHVEH was mitigated in HIGHBB (+103% vs. +72%). Increase in fecal fat amount observed in HIGHVEH was further increased in HIGHBB. Increase in PNLIP expressions observed in HIGHVEH pancreatic tissues was abolished in HIGHBB. PNLIP expression in mouse primary pancreatic acinar cells and 266-6 cell lines increased with isoproterenol treatment, which was blocked by propranolol. Isoproterenol increased PNLIP expression in a cAMP/protein kinase A/ cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent manner. CREB directly bound to the CRE on the mouse PNLIP promoter and transactivated PNLIP expression. These results suggest that sympathetic activation increases dietary fat absorption through the upregulation of PNLIP expression and that a β-adrenergic antagonist attenuates obesity development partly through the downregulation of PNLIP expression and inhibition of dietary fat absorption in the context of high fat diet feeding.",

      "abstract": "High-fat, low-carbohydrate (CHO) diets increase whole-body rates of fat oxidation and down-regulate CHO metabolism. We measured substrate utilization and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration to determine whether these adaptations are driven by high fat or low CHO availability. In a randomized crossover design, 8 male cyclists consumed 5 d of a high-CHO diet [>70% energy intake (EI)], followed by 5 d of either an isoenergetic high-fat (HFAT; >65% EI) or high-protein diet (HPRO; >65% EI) with CHO intake clamped at <20% EI. During the intervention, participants undertook daily exercise training. On d 6, participants consumed a high-CHO diet before performing 100 min of submaximal steady-state cycling plus an ∼30-min time trial. After 5 d of HFAT, skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration supported by octanoylcarnitine and pyruvate, as well as uncoupled respiration, was decreased at rest, and rates of whole-body fat oxidation were higher during exercise compared with HPRO. After 1 d of high-CHO diet intake, mitochondrial respiration returned to baseline values in HFAT, whereas rates of substrate oxidation returned toward baseline in both conditions. These findings demonstrate that high dietary fat intake, rather than low-CHO intake, contributes to reductions in mitochondrial respiration and increases in whole-body rates of fat oxidation after a consuming a high-fat, low-CHO diet.-Leckey, J.

Using a cross-over study design, we investigated the effects of short-term sex hormone suppression with or without testosterone add-back on postprandial metabolism and the fate of dietary fat. Eleven healthy males (age: 29 ± 4.5 year; BMI: 26.3 ± 2.1 kg/m2 ) completed two 7-day study phases during which hormone levels were altered pharmacologically to produce a low sex hormone condition (gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist, aromatase inhibitor, and placebo gel) or a testosterone add-back condition (testosterone gel). Following 7 days of therapy, subjects were administered an inpatient test meal containing 50 μCi of [1-14 C] oleic acid. Plasma samples were collected hourly for 5 h to assess postprandial responses. Energy metabolism (indirect calorimetry) and dietary fat oxidation (14 CO2 in breath) were assessed at 1, 3, 5, 13.5, and 24 h following the test meal. Abdominal and femoral adipose biopsies were taken 24 h after the test meal to determine uptake of the labeled lipid. Postprandial glucose, insulin, free-fatty acid, and triglyceride responses were not different between conditions (P > 0.05). Whole-body energy metabolism was also not different between conditions at any time point (P > 0.05). Dietary fat oxidation trended lower (P = 0.12) and the relative uptake of 14 C labeled lipid into femoral adipose tissue was greater (P = 0.03) in the low hormone condition. Short-term hormone suppression did not affect energy expenditure or postprandial metabolism, but contributed to greater relative storage of dietary fat in the femoral depot.

Alpha-linolenic acid-enriched diacylglycerol (ALA-DAG), which mainly occurs as ALA esterifies to 1,3-diacyl-sn-glycerol (1,3-DAG), has beneficial effects on fat metabolism and body weight compared with triacylglycerol (TAG). Moreover, compared with ALA-TAG, ALA-DAG enhances β-oxidation activity in the small intestine and liver in rodents. We hypothesized that ALA-DAG consumption may increase dietary fat oxidation compared with ALA-TAG in humans. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized double-blind cross-over trial in 17 normal and moderately obese men and women (BMI: 25.7±2.0 kg/m2, mean±SD). Each participant was assigned to a 4-week intervention period with 2.5 g/day of ALA-DAG or ALA-TAG consumption, followed by a 4-week washout period between consumption of each diet. Dietary fat oxidation, assessed based on the 13CO2 recovery rate in the breath, was significantly increased by ALA-DAG consumption compared with ALA-TAG consumption (17.0±4.5% and 14.1±5.9%, respectively, P<.05). In addition, ALA-DAG consumption significantly decreased the visceral fat area compared with ALA-TAG (102.9±51.9 cm2 and 110.9±51.7 cm2, respectively; P<.05). These results indicate that ALA-DAG consumption may be useful for preventing obesity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity, a major cause of death and disability, is increasing worldwide. Obesity is characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state which is suggested to play a critical role in the development of obesity-related diseases like cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. In fact, in the hours following consumption of a meal, a transient increase in inflammatory markers occurs, a response that is exaggerated in obese subjects. Dietary composition, including content of dietary fatty acids, may affect this inflammatory response both acutely and chronically, and thereby be predictive of progression of disease. The aim of the review was to summarize the literature from 2010 to 2016 regarding the effects of dietary fat intake on levels of inflammatory markers in overweight and obesity in human randomized controlled trials. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases. The literature search included human randomized controlled trials, both postprandial and long-term interventions, from January 2010 to September 2016. In total, 37 articles were included. Interventions with dairy products, vegetable oils, or nuts showed minor effects on inflammatory markers. The most consistent inflammatory-mediating effects were found in intervention with whole diets, which suggests that many components of the diet reduce inflammation synergistically. Furthermore, interventions with weight reduction and different fatty acids did not clearly show beneficial effects on inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: Most interventions showed either no or minor effects of dietary fat intake on inflammatory markers in overweight and obese subjects. To progress our understanding on how diet and dietary components affect our health, mechanistic studies are required. Hence, future studies should include whole diets and characterization of obese phenotypes at a molecular level, including omics data and gut microbiota."

Dietary interventions are lacking. We investigated dietary modulation of LIPC rs1800588 (-514 C/T) for lipids and glucose using a randomized crossover design comparing a high-fat Western diet and a low-fat traditional Hispanic diet in individuals of Caribbean Hispanic descent (n = 42, 4 wk/phase). No significant gene-diet interactions were observed for HDL-C. However, differences in dietary response according to LIPC genotype were observed. In major allele carriers (CC/CT), HDL-C (mmol/l) was higher following the Western diet compared with the Hispanic diet: phase 1 (Western: 1.3 ± 0.03; Hispanic: 1.1 ± 0.04; P = 0.0004); phase 2 (Western: 1.4 ± 0.03; Hispanic: 1.2 ± 0.03; P = 0.0003). In contrast, HDL-C in TT individuals did not differ by diet. Only major allele carriers benefited from the higher-fat diet for HDL-C. Secondarily, we explored dietary fat quality and rs1800588 for HDL-C and triglycerides (TG) in a Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS) subset matched for diabetes and obesity status (subset n = 384). In the BPRHS, saturated fat was unfavorably associated with HDL-C and TG in rs1800588 TT carriers. LIPC rs1800588 appears to modify plasma lipids in the context of dietary fat. This new evidence of genetic modulation of dietary responses may inform optimal and personalized dietary fat advice and reinforces the importance of studying genetic markers in diet and cardiometabolic health.",

We recently observed an enhanced upregulation of ACE by elevated fat intake in GG-carriers of the I/D-surrogate rs4343 variant and therefore investigated its potential nutrigenetic role in glucose metabolism. In this nutritional intervention study 46 healthy and non-obese twin pairs consumed recommended low fat diets for 6 weeks before they received a 6-week high fat (HF) diet under isocaloric conditions. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after 1 and 6 weeks of HF diet. While glucose tolerance did not differ between genotypes at baseline it significantly declined in GG-carriers after 6 weeks HF diet (p = 0.001) with higher 2 h glucose and insulin concentrations compared to AA/AG-carriers (p = 0.003 and p = 0.042). Furthermore, the gene-diet interaction was confirmed in the cross-sectional Metabolic Syndrome Berlin Potsdam study (p = 0.012), with the GG-genotypes being significantly associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes for participants with high dietary fat intake ≥37% (GG vs. AA/AG, OR 2.36 [1.02-5.49], p = 0.045). In conclusion, the association between the rs4343 variant and glucose tolerance is modulated by dietary fat intake.

The validation of exon array results was focused on troponin T (Tnnt3). Tnnt3 splice form analyses were extended in studies of rats fed 10% or 30% fat diets across 1- to 8-wk treatment periods and rats fed 10% or 45% fat diets with fat sources from lard or mono- or polyunsaturated fats for 2 wk. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to measure body composition.Results: Consumption of a 60% fat diet for 2 or 8 wk resulted in alternative splicing of 668 and 726 pre-mRNAs, respectively, compared with rats fed a 10% fat diet. Tnnt3 transcripts were alternatively spliced in rats fed a 60% fat diet for either 2 or 8 wk. The high-fat-diet-induced changes in Tnnt3 alternative splicing were observed in rats fed a 30% fat diet across 1- to 8-wk treatment periods. Moreover, this effect depended on fat type, because Tnnt3 alternative splicing occurred in response to 45% fat diets enriched with lard but not in response to diets enriched with mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fat mass (a proxy for obesity as measured by NMR) did not differ between groups in any study.Conclusions: Rat skeletal muscle responds to overconsumption of dietary fat by modifying gene expression through pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Variations in Tnnt3 alternative splicing occur independently of obesity and are dependent on dietary fat quantity and suggest a role for saturated fatty acids in the high-fat-diet-induced modifications in Tnnt3 alternative splicing.",

Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) and conjugated linolenic fatty acids share important pathways of immune system activation/inhibition with gut microbes, modulating obesogenic and proinflammatory profiles. Mechanisms that link dietary fat, gut microbiota and obesity are mediated by increased intestinal permeability, systemic endotoxemia, and the activity of the endocannabinoid system. Although the probiotic therapy could be a complementary strategy to improve gut microbiota composition, it did not show permanent effects to treat fat-induced dysbiosis. Based upon evidence to date, we believe that high-fat diets and SFA consumption should be avoided, and MUFA and omega-3 PUFA intake should be encouraged in order to regulate gut microbiota and inflammation, promoting body weight/fat control.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In recent years, epidemiological studies have strongly related obesity with an increased risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer. The aromatization of fatty tissue increases the levels of estradiol and adiponectin, which is correlated with the body mass index (BMI). It is of interest to investigate the effect of reducing BMI on estradiol, adiponectin, and IGF-1, as reducing BMI could be a new strategy to limit the risk of recurrence during the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of reduced dietary fat on the levels of serum estradiol, adiponectin, and IGF-1 among postmenopausal Mexican women with breast cancer. METHODS: In this controlled clinical trial, 100 female patients were randomly divided into two groups and followed for six months. Group 1 (n = 50) was subjected to reduced dietary fat, whereas Group 2 (n = 50) was subjected to a control diet. The levels of serum estradiol and testosterone were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas the concentrations of adiponectin and IGF-1 were determined using a radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: The patients subjected to reduced dietary fat showed a significant difference in BMI (27.93 ± 4.45 vs 26.05 ± 2.65; p = 0.01) and waist circumference (99.92 vs 91.59 cm; p = 0.0001) after the treatment. Moreover, a significant decrease in serum estradiol was observed (21.23 ± 14.32 vs 16.05 ± 10.25 ng/mL; p < 0.001). The adiponectin concentration also decreased significantly (47.53 ± 12.19 vs 42.52 ± 12.34 µg/mL; p = 0.004), while IGF-1 and testosterone did not show significant changes (p > 0.05). In addition, BMI had a relationship with serum adiponectin (r = -0.27; p = 0.02) and estradiol (r = 0.37; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The current study shows that reducing BMI decreases serum estradiol and adiponectin. Large clinical trials are needed to investigate the role of adiponectin in breast cancer development in obese women."

The deposition of FA in the body and the fate of individual dietary FA were assessed after slaughter. Gilts with an initial body weight (BW) of 60 kg were used as experimental animals. Six pigs were slaughtered at 60 kg BW, while further 18 pigs received three isoenergetic and isonitrogen experimental diets containing linseed oil, rapeseed oil or beef tallow at 50 g/kg diet until they reached 105 kg (six pigs per group). The chemical composition and the content of FA in the whole body were determined and compared across groups. Regardless of dietary treatment, the whole body contained similar amounts of protein, fat and total FA. The total accumulation (percentage of net intake and de novo production) of SFA and MUFA was similar in all groups, but the processes of elongation and desaturation of SFA and MUFA depended upon the type of FA added to the diet. A high dietary content and intake of MUFA inhibits desaturation compared to SFA- and PUFA-rich diets, whereas a high SFA content and intake lowers elongation rate. The increasing net intake of total SFA and MUFA was associated with a lower total de novo production of these FA in the whole body of pigs.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of food that surpasses the metabolic necessity of the body leads to an epidemic condition termed obesity, which causes several metabolic disorders including oxidative damage. Dietary intervention can enlighten the mechanisms and therapeutics associated with these metabolic disorders. The reported studies related to diet include fat of different kinds and from different sources, however they lack dose response aspects. Our study highlighted the importance of dietary fat modification in modulating oxidative stress-induced glucose intolerance. Animals were maintained on a diet with a varied content of fat (30%/45%/60%) for 12 weeks and the 'withdrawal' group was fed a standard diet for another 10 weeks. The diet containing 60 energy% of fat displayed glucose intolerance, high ALT, low GSH levels and tissue-specific modulation of the prooxidant/antioxidant enzymatic activities in the liver/muscles. Prolonged sustenance of the 60 energy% fat containing diet-fed rats on standard diet led to the alteration of antioxidant activities, reversing the oxidative damage. Notably, the 'withdrawal' group displayed an organ-specific response towards dietary modification where the recovery of the antioxidant activities was observed to be much more pronounced in the liver as compared to the muscle. Further, we identified the differential expression of liver/muscle-specific genes associated with oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis in response to the differing fat content. These genes can serve as markers for HFD-induced metabolic complications involving the liver/muscle. Altogether, our study has highlighted the novel area where obesity-induced oxidative stress linked alterations expressed diet and organ specific responses that are recovered by altering the dietary regimen. Future investigation of dietary modulation will open nascent avenues for developing therapeutic modalities addressing obesity-related metabolic complications.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic links between diet and particular oncogenic mutations in human cancers remain unclear. We recently reported that the ketone body acetoacetate selectively enhances BRAF V600E mutant-dependent MEK1 activation in human cancers. Here we show that a high-fat ketogenic diet increased serum levels of acetoacetate, leading to enhanced tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing human melanoma cells in xenograft mice. Treatment with hypolipidemic agents to lower circulating acetoacetate levels or an inhibitory homolog of acetoacetate, dehydroacetic acid, to antagonize acetoacetate-BRAF V600E binding attenuated BRAF V600E tumor growth. These findings reveal a signaling basis underlying a pathogenic role of dietary fat in BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma, providing insights into the design of conceptualized \"precision diets\" that may prevent or delay tumor progression based on an individual's specific oncogenic mutation profile.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: In sequential order, participants (n = 12 E3/E3, n = 11 E3/E4) followed low fat; high-fat, high-saturated fat (HSF); and HSF with 3.45 g/day docosahexaenoic acid (HSF-DHA) diets, each for 8 weeks. After each dietary period, an acute test meal with a macronutrient profile representative of the dietary intervention was consumed. Apolipoprotein (apo)B isoforms were determined in isolated TAG-rich lipoprotein fractions (Svedberg flotation rate (Sf ) > 400, Sf 60-400, and Sf 20-60) by specific ELISA. A genotype × meal/diet interaction for the Sf > 400 fraction apoB-48 response (p < 0.05) was observed, with higher concentrations reached after the low fat than HSF-DHA meal in E4 carriers. This finding was associated with a lower TAG content of the Sf > 400 particles. Fasting Sf 60-400 and 20-60 apoB-48 concentrations were also significantly higher in E4 carriers. No impact of genotype on the apoB-100 responses was evident. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed marked effects of dietary fat composition on the Sf > 400 apoB-48 response and particle TAG content in E4 carriers relative to the \"wild-type\" E3/E3 genotype, which suggest APOE genotype is a potential modulator of chylomicron particle synthesis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gut microbiota may promote positive energy balance; however, germfree mice can be either resistant or susceptible to diet-induced obesity (DIO) depending on the type of dietary intervention. We here sought to identify the dietary constituents that determine the susceptibility to body fat accretion in germfree (GF) mice. METHODS: GF and specific pathogen free (SPF) male C57BL/6N mice were fed high-fat diets either based on lard or palm oil for 4 wks. Mice were metabolically characterized at the end of the feeding trial. FT-ICR-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS were used for cecal as well as hepatic metabolite profiling and cecal bile acids quantification, respectively. Hepatic gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and cecal gut microbiota of SPF mice was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: GF mice, but not SPF mice, were completely DIO resistant when fed a cholesterol-rich lard-based high-fat diet, whereas on a cholesterol-free palm oil-based high-fat diet, DIO was independent of gut microbiota. In GF lard-fed mice, DIO resistance was conveyed by increased energy expenditure, preferential carbohydrate oxidation, and increased fecal fat and energy excretion. Cecal metabolite profiling revealed a shift in bile acid and steroid metabolites in these lean mice, with a significant rise in 17β-estradiol, which is known to stimulate energy expenditure and interfere with bile acid metabolism. Decreased cecal bile acid levels were associated with decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in bile acid synthesis. These metabolic adaptations were largely attenuated in GF mice fed the palm-oil based high-fat diet. We propose that an interaction of gut microbiota and cholesterol metabolism is essential for fat accretion in normal SPF mice fed cholesterol-rich lard as the main dietary fat source. This is supported by a positive correlation between bile acid levels and specific bacteria of the order Clostridiales (phylum Firmicutes) as a characteristic feature of normal SPF mice fed lard. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study identified dietary cholesterol as a candidate ingredient affecting the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host metabolism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-fat diets may contribute to metabolic disease via postprandial changes in serum endotoxin and inflammation. It is unclear how dietary fat composition may alter these parameters. We hypothesized that a meal rich in n-3 (ω3) fatty acids would reduce endotoxemia and associated inflammation but a saturated or n-6 (ω6) fatty acid-rich meal would increase postprandial serum endotoxin concentrations and systemic inflammation in healthy adults. METHODS: Healthy adults (n = 20; mean age 25 ± 3.2 S.D. years) were enrolled in this single-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Participants were randomized to treatment and reported to the laboratory, after an overnight fast, on four occasions separated by at least one week. Participants were blinded to treatment meal and consumed one of four isoenergetic meals that provided: 1) 20 % fat (control; olive oil) or 35 % fat provided from 2) n-3 (ω3) (DHA = 500 mg; fish oil); 3) n-6 (ω6) (7.4 g; grapeseed oil) or 4) saturated fat (16 g; coconut oil). Baseline and postprandial blood samples were collected. Primary outcome was defined as the effect of treatment meal on postprandial endotoxemia. Serum was analyzed for metabolites, inflammatory markers, and endotoxin. Data from all 20 participants were analyzed using repeated-measures ANCOVA. RESULTS: Participant serum endotoxin concentration was increased during the postprandial period after the consumption of the saturated fat meal but decreased after the n-3 meal (p < 0.05). The n-6 meal did not effect a different outcome in participant postprandial serum endotoxin concentration from that of the control meal (p > 0.05). There was no treatment meal effect on participant postprandial serum biomarkers of inflammation. Postprandial serum triacylglycerols were significantly elevated following the n-6 meal compared to the n-3 meal. Non-esterified fatty acids were significantly increased after consumption of the saturated fat meal compared to other treatment meals. CONCLUSIONS: Meal fatty acid composition modulates postprandial serum endotoxin concentration in healthy adults. However, postprandial endotoxin was not associated with systemic inflammation in vivo. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02521779 on July 28, 2015.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intake of red meat is considered a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) development, and heme, the prosthetic group of myoglobin, has been suggested as a potential cause. One of the proposed molecular mechanisms of heme-induced CRC is based on an increase in the rate of lipid peroxidation catalysed by heme. METHODS: In the present work, the novel A/J Min/+ mouse model for Apc-driven colorectal cancer was used to investigate the effect of dietary heme (0.5 μmol/g), combined with high (40 energy %) or low (10 energy %) dietary fat levels, on intestinal carcinogenesis. At the end of the dietary intervention period (week 3-11), spontaneously developed lesions in the colon (flat aberrant crypt foci (flat ACF) and tumors) and small intestine (tumors) were scored and thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), a biomarker for lipid peroxidation was analysed in feces. RESULTS: Dietary hemin significantly reduced colonic carcinogenesis. The inhibitory effect of hemin was not dependent on the dietary fat level, and no association could be established between colonic carcinogenesis and the lipid oxidation rate measured as fecal TBARS. Small intestinal carcinogenesis was not affected by hemin. Fat tended to stimulate intestinal carcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Contradicting the hypothesis, dietary hemin did inhibit colonic carcinogenesis in the present study. The results indicate that fecal TBARS concentration is not directly related to intestinal lesions and is therefore not a suitable biomarker for CRC.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) restrict fat intake. The Geiselman Food Preference Questionnaire-I© (FPQ) is a validated self-report instrument that yields a fat preference score (>100 = high fat preference, <100 = low fat preference). The goal of the study was to assess the utility of the FPQ in patients with AN. SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) to examine change in fat preference scores before and after weight restoration in hospitalized patients; and (2) to compare patients' scores before and after weight restoration to scores from healthy participants (HPs). METHOD: The FPQ was completed by 88 patients and 115 HPs. RESULTS: Compared with HPs, patients had significantly lower fat preference scores before (74.03 ± 32.03 vs. 102.93 ± 16.89, P < 0.001) and after (81.51 ± 26.89 vs. 102.92 ± 16.89, P < 0.001) weight restoration. Fat preference scores increased with weight gain (74.03 + 32.03 vs. 81.51 + 26.89, P < 0.01) but did not normalize in AN. DISCUSSION: Acutely weight restored patients continue to endorse decreased preference for high fat foods. The FPQ may be a useful metric by which to assess improvements in diet during treatment. Further study is warranted to validate the FPQ against observed food intake in AN. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:148-151).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: National dietary guidelines were introduced in 1977 and 1983, by the USA and UK governments, respectively, with the ambition of reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality by reducing dietary fat intake. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by the present authors, examining the randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence available to the dietary committees during those time periods, found no support for the recommendations to restrict dietary fat. The present investigation extends our work by re-examining the totality of RCT evidence relating to the current dietary fat guidelines. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs currently available, which examined the relationship between dietary fat, serum cholesterol and the development of CHD, was undertaken. RESULTS: The systematic review included 62 421 participants in 10 dietary trials: 7 secondary prevention studies, 1 primary prevention and 2 combined. The death rates for all-cause mortality were 6.45% and 6.06% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The risk ratio (RR) from meta-analysis was 0.991 (95% CI 0.935 to 1.051). The death rates for CHD mortality were 2.16% and 1.80% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The RR was 0.976 (95% CI 0.878 to 1.084). Mean serum cholesterol levels decreased in all intervention groups and all but one control group. The reductions in mean serum cholesterol levels were significantly greater in the intervention groups; this did not result in significant differences in CHD or all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The current available evidence found no significant difference in all-cause mortality or CHD mortality, resulting from the dietary fat interventions. RCT evidence currently available does not support the current dietary fat guidelines. The evidence per se lacks generalisability for population-wide guidelines."

      "abstract": "Adequate brain iron levels are essential for enzyme activities, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain. Although systemic iron deficiency has been found in genetically or dietary-induced obese subjects, the effects of obesity-associated iron dysregulation in brain regions have not been examined. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dietary fat and iron interaction on brain regional iron contents and regional-associated behavior patterns in a mouse model. Thirty C57BL/6J male weanling mice were randomly assigned to six dietary treatment groups (n = 5) with varying fat (control/high) and iron (control/high/low) contents. The stereotypical behaviors were measured during the 24th week. Blood, liver, and brain tissues were collected at the end of the 24th week. Brains were dissected into the hippocampus, midbrain, striatum, and thalamus regions. Iron contents and ferritin heavy chain (FtH) protein and mRNA expressions in these regions were measured. Correlations between stereotypical behaviors and brain regional iron contents were analyzed at the 5% significance level. Results showed that high-fat diet altered the stereotypical behaviors such as inactivity and total distance traveled (P < 0.05). The high-fat diet altered brain iron contents and FtH protein and mRNA expressions in a regional-specific manner: (1) high-fat diet significantly decreased the brain iron content in the striatum (P < 0.05), but not other regions, and (2) thalamus has a more distinct change in FtH mRNA expression compared with other regions. Furthermore, high-fat diet resulted in a significant decreased total distance traveled and a significant correlation between iron content and sleeping in midbrain (P < 0.05). Dietary iron also decreased brain iron content and FtH protein expression in a regionally specific manner. The effect of interaction between dietary fat and iron was observed in brain iron content and behaviors. All these findings will lay foundations to further explore the links among obesity, behaviors, and brain iron alteration."
