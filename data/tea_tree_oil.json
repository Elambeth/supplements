      "abstract": "The excessive utilization of antibiotics gives rise to the development of bacterial resistance, the deterioration of animal immune functions, the increase in mortality rates, and the undermining of human immunity. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity to explore new antimicrobial agents or alternatives to tackle bacterial resistance. We investigated tea tree oil (TTO), a pure natural plant essential oil extracted from Melaleuca leaves, which exerted efficient antibacterial activities. However, the poor solubility and high volatility of TTO limited the clinical application. Therefore, tea tree oil and Tween 80 were formulated into a stable nanoemulsion (Nano TTO). We attested that Nano TTO, as an antibiotic adjuvant, enhanced the antibacterial activity of amoxicillin (AMX) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and inhibited the formation of biofilms. Mechanistic studies proved that the Nano TTO potentiation effect on AMX was primarily the result of inhibition of the Agr expression by targeting the accessory regulator AgrA. Furthermore, Nano TTO effectively boosts the efficacy of amoxicillin in the mouse septicaemia model and mouse skin wound infection model. Overall, these results revealed the potential of Nano TTO as an adjuvant to evade multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens and improve treatment outcomes for drug-resistant infections.",

      "abstract": "Intensification of poultry industry has led to a surge in animal product output, but this has also revealed issues with environmental management in poultry houses, particularly the harmful effects of high hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels on poultry health. The study aimed to assess the therapeutic impact of tea tree oil (TTO) on H2S-induced spleen and intestinal injuries in chickens. A total of 240 one-day-old Lohmann Brown chicks were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (CON), the H2S exposure group (AVG), and the TTO treatment group (TTG), with four replicates, each consisting of 20 chicks. The experiment lasted 42 days. Results showed that TTO treatment alleviated tissue damage in the thymus, kidneys, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius, and improved the organ index (P < 0.05) compared with the AVG. Serum analysis revealed that TTO lowered levels of alanine aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), triglycerides(TG), CD3 positive CD4 positive T cells(CD3+CD4+), CD4 positive to CD8 positive Rratio(CD4+/CD8+), and alkaline phosphatase(AKP), while increasing albumin(ALB), globulin(GLO), immunoglobulin A(IgA), and immunoglobulin G(IgG) levels (P < 0.05). Intestinal findings indicated that TTO treatment enhanced villus height, reduced crypt depth, and upregulated the expression of Claudin 1, Occludin, and ZO-1 mRNA in the jejunum (P < 0.05). After TTO treatment, H2S-induced oxidative stress injury and apoptosis protein expression in spleen were improved (P < 0.05). TTO also reduced interferon-γ(INF-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and interleukin-1β(IL-1β) proteins (P < 0.05), while raising CD3+CD8+ T-cell subsets (P < 0.05). Compared with CON, TTO treatment alleviated serum biochemical disorders and intestinal damage caused by H2S exposure and restored them to normal (P > 0.05). In conclusion, TTO can improve spleen and intestinal function and reduce the effects of H2S on growth performance and health of chickens.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting millions worldwide each year, poses a significant threat due to its potential for progressive joint damage and debilitating pain if left untreated. Topical anti-inflammatory and analgesic treatments offer localized relief with reduced systemic side effects compared to conventional oral therapies, making them a promising option for managing rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the current study endeavored to formulate a microemulsion gel formulation loaded with diclofenac and curcumin for topical administration in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, utilizing Tea tree oil. The ratio of surfactant and cosurfactant was 4:1, assessed by pseudoternary phase diagram on the basis of the maximum emulsification region. The microemulsion underwent optimization using a Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) with constraints of minimum particle size, polydispersity index, and maximum transmittance. The Curcufenac-T microemulsion had a particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and transmittance of 151.82 ± 15.9 nm, 0.287 ± 0.021, and -5.78 ± 0.26 mV, respectively. DSC analyses confirmed the stability and compatibility of diclofenac and curcumin within the formulation. The microemulsion was changed into gel form by incorporating 1% carbopol-934. Skin permeation analysis revealed that the percentage of diclofenac permeated at 0.5 h from Curcufenac-T microemugel and the conventional gel was 12.1% and 3.9%, respectively, while at 12 h, the rates were 82.6% and 34.2%, respectively. In vitro permeability demonstrated significant potential for the effective delivery of diclofenac and curcumin to targeted sites, compared to conventional gel. Therefore, it was deduced that the Tea tree oil integrated diclofenac and curcumin microemulsion gel could enhance the effectiveness of diclofenac and serve as a promising vehicle for rheumatoid arthritis treatment."

      "abstract": "The current study evaluated the influence of the treatment with tea tree oil and cefepime on morpho- genetic, histo-immunohistochemical, and biochemical assessments in rats experimentally challenged with Escherichia coli ATCC 4157™. Thirty adult male rats were divided into control, E. coli infected positive group (1×108CFU/I/P/once), E. coli with cefepime-supplemented group (45 mg/kg bw/I/M/day), E. coli with tea tree oil treated group (1.5 ml/per os/day), and the E. coli-challenged group that received a combination of tea tree oil and cefepime. E. coli infection induced morphological changes in color and texture of both liver and kidney. The transcription levels of the PHLPP2 and Nrf2 genes were noticeably lowered in all treated groups related to the E. coli group. Regarding the TLR4 expression, it was clearly up-regulated in the E. coli group in comparison to other groups, while CD14 gene decreased clearly in all treated groups compared to the positive group. The findings revealed that RBC, HGB, and PCV were clearly higher in the positive group compared to all treated groups. AST, ALT, and ALP, total bilirubin and its fractions, urea, and creatinine maximized in the positive group and decreased by the treatment, especially in the E+CF+oil treated group. Regarding the redox balance, MDA levels of MDA were notably reduced in the E+CF+oil treated group compared to the positive and the other treated groups. GSH, SOD, and GPX were significantly induced in the E. coil-treated group and decreased significantly with treatment. Overall, cefepime is highly safe especially when dually supplied with tea tree oil for mitigating E. coli adverse impact.",

      "abstract": "Infectious diseases, especially multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, have caused crises and majorly disrupted public health and economic stability worldwide. Many natural essential oils, especially tea tree oil, have potential to treat multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as H. pylori and P. aeruginosa. However, there are some problems need to be solved, such as poor stability upon light or oxygen exposure. Therefore, it is urgent to develop the ideal formation to tackle these difficulties. Herein, we reported the novel chitosan-modified self-nanoemulsion (TNE) encapsulating natural essential tea tree oil with strong antibacterial and stability characterize. In this study, we found that this self-nanoemulsion (size: 212 nm, PDI: 0.124, zeta potential: -20.5 mV, 6 % tea tree oil) not only had physical properties, good stability and tissue safety, but also had better antibacterial synergism (2-8 times) than that of water suspension against various multidrug-resistant bacterial (such as H. pylori, MRSA and P. aeruginosa). Additionally, TNE showed high antibacterial effectiveness in vivo, reduced inflammation, promoted ulcer healing after H. pylori infection and accelerated wound healing after P. aeruginosa infection. Importantly, this novel self-nanoemulsion can induce 274 protein down-regulated and 251 protein up-regulated, and disrupt H. pylori metabolic processes (glyoxylate, dicarboxylic acid, glutamate and tryptophan metabolism) and reduced its viability, leading to significant synergistic antibacterial effects. TNE is a potential treatment for skin wounds or ulcers caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the use of tea tree oil (TTO) in the treatment of H2S-induced lung injury in chickens, focusing on the detoxification mechanism. H2S can damage the respiratory system and reduce growth performance. TTO can improve immune inflammation and growth performance. The mechanism by which TTO mitigates the harmful effects of H2S on chicken lungs remains unclear. Therefore, the experimental model was established by H2S exposure and TTO addition in drinking water. The 240 one-day-old Roman pink chicks were selected for the experiment. The trial was divided into control group (CON), treatment group (TTG, 0.02 mL/L TTO+H2S) and H2S exposure group (AVG, H2S). There were 4 replicates in each group and the trial lasted for 42 d. The therapeutic effect of TTO on lung injury in chickens were determined by growth performance evaluation, transcription sequencing and network pharmacology analysis. The results showed that in the test's third week, the body weights of the chickens in the CON were higher than those in the AVG and TTG (P < 0.05). Pathological sections showed that TTO alleviated the symptoms of lung inflammation and bleeding caused by ROS. As showed by transcriptional sequencing, the mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes Caspase-9, BAK-1, BCL-2 and BAX were significantly altered (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17 were downregulated (P < 0.05). Network pharmacological analysis showed that CA2, CA4, GABRA5 and ADH1C were the key targets of TTO. The TTO treatment significantly altered these targets (P < 0.05). Molecular docking confirmed the strong binding ability between the active component and the targets. This study showed that TTO inhibits H2S-induced oxidative damage to the lungs, thereby improving their health status. This provides a new solution for the prevention of harmful gas in the poultry industry.",

      "abstract": "Tea tree oil (TTO) improves the intestinal mucosal immunity of weaning piglets, but its underlying mechanism is not clear. We hypothesized that TTO may alleviate inflammatory injury by regulating the function of intestinal epithelial cells. Ileum epithelial cells (IPI-2I) were chosen and an inflammatory injury cell model was generated. The cell viability, cytokine secretion, and gene expression of TLR4 and NF-κB were measured to further evaluate the effects of TTO on the inflammatory injury in immune-stressed cells. The results showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS; content: ≥30 μg/mL; time: 3 h, 6 h, or 9 h) decreased cell viability (p < 0.01), and 50 μg/mL LPS stimulated for 6 h resulted in an increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and a dramatically decreased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.05) in IPI-2I cells. Concentrations of 0-0.05% of TTO improved cell viability, while the 0.03% TTO treatment resulted in the highest cell viability and alleviated LPS-induced cell death (p < 0.01). In addition, 0.03% TTO alleviated the LPS-induced increase in the gene expression of IL-1β, TNFα, and IFNγ, as well as the decrease in the expression of IL-10 in IPI-2I cells (p < 0.05). LPS also upregulated the gene expression of TLR4 and NF-κB (p < 0.05); while TTO supplementation alleviated this effect (p < 0.05), 0.03% and 0.05% TTO supplementation had greater effects (p < 0.05). In conclusion, 50 μg/mL LPS stimulated for 6 h can be used to establish an immune-stressed cell model in IPI-2I cell lines, and 0.03% TTO treatment for 6 h alleviated inflammatory injury in the intestinal epithelial cells of pigs."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three electronic databases were searched from 2003. The reference lists of the included articles and relevant reviews were also manually searched. Randomised controlled trials reporting the clinical outcomes of the topical use of TTO as an adjunct to daily oral hygiene or scaling and root planing (SRP) were included. Regarding the use of TTO as an adjunctive to daily oral hygiene, the primary outcome was plaque index (PI) reduction. Regarding the use of TTO as an adjunctive to SRP, probing pocket depth (PPD) reduction and clinical attachment level (CAL) gain were the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were adverse events. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included for qualitative analysis, 9 studies were included for quantitative analysis, and 6 studies were included to examine the application of TTO mouthwash as an adjunctive to daily oral hygiene. In addition, three studies were included to analyse the subgingival use of TTO adjunctive to SRP at selected sites. The results indicated a nonsignificant improvement in PI reduction in the TTO mouthwash group compared with placebo. The incidence of adverse events was statistically significantly greater in the CHX group than in the TTO group. For subgingival use of TTO adjunctive to SRP, beneficial effects were observed in the TTO group compared with SRP alone in terms of PPD and CAL at both three and six months post-treatment. However, an unpleasant taste was reported in three out of four studies. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of strong evidence to support the beneficial effects of TTO. Studies with larger sample sizes and standardised evaluation criteria are needed to further demonstrate the clinical relevance of TTO.",

      "abstract": "Tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) oil (TTO) is an antimicrobial agent, and hence, its use in fabricating nanoparticles (NP) may be useful in providing more efficacious antimicrobial agents. The current research aimed to test the antimicrobial efficacy of TTO and its TTO-Metal-NPs against oral microbes: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans. The antimicrobial activity of TTO and zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) and the combined effects of antimicrobial agents were investigated using agar well diffusion assays. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to identify the phyto-constituents of TTO. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), dynamic light scatter (DLS), and zeta potential were utilized to analyze the biogenic nanoparticles' morphology, size, and potential. The antimicrobial mode of action was determined by assessing the morphological changes under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The TTO extracts converted Zn and Fe ions to NPs, having an average size of 97.50 (ZnNPs) and 102.4 nm (FeNPs). All tested agents had significant antibacterial efficacy against the tested oral microbes. However, the TTO extract was more efficacious than the NPs. Combination treatment of TTO with antibiotics resulted in partial additive effects against P. gingivalis and partial antagonistic effects against E. faecalis, S. mutans, and common mouthwashes (Oral B and chlorhexidine). TTO and NP-treated bacteria underwent morphological changes on treatment. M. alternifolia phytochemicals could be useful for further research and development of antimicrobial NPs. The current study highlights the variance in activity observed for different types of bacteria and antagonistic effects seen with common mouthwashes, which represent a threat to therapeutic efficacy and heighten the risk of clinical microbial resistance.",

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to detect lung histopathology. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using transcriptomics. The underlying mechanism of the amelioration of lung injury by TTO was further revealed by antioxidant enzyme assays and qRT-PCR. The results showed that H2S exposure induced significant gene expression of CYP450s (CYP1B1 and CYP1C1) (P < 0.05), and caused intense oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation compared with CON. TTO could reduce ROS production and enhance antioxidant capacity (SOD, CAT, T-AOC, and GSH-PX) by regulating the CYP450s/ROS pathway (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the treatment group showed significantly decreased expression of apoptotic (Caspase-8, Caspase-3, Bid and Fas) (P < 0.05) and inflammatory (IL-4, IL-16, NF-κB, TNF-α and IFN-γ) (P < 0.05) factors in the lung. This study revealed that TTO regulated CYP450s/ROS pathway to alleviate H2S-induced lung injury in chickens. These results enrich the theory of the action mechanism of TTO on H2S-exposed chicken lungs and are of great value for the treatment of H2S-exposed animals.",

In this study, the essential oil was extracted from fresh M. alternifolia (tea tree) leaves, and the fumigation vapor of tea tree oil (TTO) completely inhibited the growth of Aspergillus flavus on agar plates at a concentration of 1.714 μL/mL. Terpinen-4-ol was identified as the major component (40.76 %) of TTO volatiles analyzed using headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Terpinen-4-ol vapor completely inhibited the A. flavus growth on agar plates and 20 % moisture wheat grain at 0.556 and 1.579 μL/mL, respectively, indicating that terpinen-4-ol serves as the main antifungal constituent in TTO volatiles. The minimum inhibitory concentration of terpinen-4-ol in liquid-contact culture was 1.6 μL/mL. Terpinen-4-ol treatment caused depressed, wrinkled, and punctured mycelial morphology and destroyed the plasma membrane integrity of A. flavus. Metabolomics analysis identified significant alterations in 93 metabolites, with 79 upregulated and 14 downregulated in A. flavus mycelia exposed to 1.6 μL/mL terpinen-4-ol for 6 h, involved in multiple cellular processes including cell membrane permeability and integrity, the ABC transport system, pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Biochemical analysis and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining showed that terpinen-4-ol induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in A. flavus mycelia. This study provides new insights into the antifungal effects of the main TTO volatile compounds terpinen-4-ol on the growth of A. flavus.",

Currently, the efficacy of black pepper essential oil (BPO) and tea tree oil (TTO) were in vitro evaluated against Haemonchus contortus adults, eggs and larvae at concentrations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/ml in addition to the commercially used albendazole at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Oils were used in both normal and nanoparticles-loaded forms. Oxidative stress enzymes of worms were estimated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for treated worms was done. Both normal and nanoemulsion forms of both BPO and TTO stopped the adult motility [BPO 2.5 h (hrs), NBPO 1.5 h, TTO 3 h, NTTO 1.5 h] and induced a marked decrease in the oviposition. Post treatment, the egg development and hatching were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced. The damage of the egg shell, embryonal cessation and destruction of larvae occurred. Noticeable elevated antioxidant enzymes (catalase CAT, glutathione transferase GST and glutathione GSH) were found, while oxidative enzymes (lipid peroxidation LPO and nitric oxide synthase NOS) decreased. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for both oil-treated worms revealed anterior ends damage and several cuts associated with cuticular pores. The use of albendazole induced more or less anthelmintic and enzymatic activities with less morphological alterations of adults revealed by SEM. This study proved the marked anthelmintic potency of the BPO and TTO and their nanoemulsion forms against H. contortus rather than the widely used anthelmintic drugs."

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. It is a debilitating condition that can cause significant physical and emotional distress. Natural anti-psoriatic agents have been investigated as alternatives to conventional allopathic medications, as they have notable limitations and drawbacks. Curcumin and tea tree oil are cost-efficient and effective anti-inflammatory medicines with less adverse effects compared to synthetic psoriasis medications. Our research endeavors to harness the therapeutic potential of these natural compounds by developing an herbal anti-psoriatic topical drug delivery system. This novel method uses curcumin and tea tree oil to create a bi-phasic emulgel drug delivery system. Formulations F1 (gel) and F2 (emulgel) have high drug content percentages of 84.2% and 96.7%, respectively. The emulgel showed better spreadability for cutaneous applications, with a viscosity of 92,200 ± 943 cp compared to the gel's 56,200 ± 1725 cp. The emulgel released 94.48% of the drugs, compared to 87.58% for the gel. These formulations conform to the zero-order and Higuchi models, and their stability over a three-month period is crucial. In vivo, the emulgel healed psoriasis symptoms faster than the usual gel. The gathered results confirmed the emulgel's potential as a drug delivery method, emphasizing the complementary benefits of tea tree oil and curcumin as an effective new therapy for psoriasis."

      "abstract": "Over the past few decades, complementary and alternative treatments have become increasingly popular worldwide. The purported therapeutic characteristics of natural products have come under increased scrutiny both in vitro and in vivo as part of efforts to legitimize their usage. One such product is tea tree oil (TTO), a volatile essential oil primarily obtained from the native Australian plant, Melaleuca alternifolia, which has diverse traditional and industrial applications such as topical preparations for the treatment of skin infections. Its anti-inflammatory-linked immunomodulatory actions have also been reported. This systematic review focuses on the anti-inflammatory effects of TTO and its main components that have shown strong immunomodulatory potential. An extensive literature search was performed electronically for data curation on worldwide accepted scientific databases, such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and esteemed publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, Frontiers, and Taylor & Francis. Considering that the majority of pharmacological studies were conducted on crude oils only, the extracted data were critically analyzed to gain further insight into the prospects of TTO being used as a neuroprotective agent by drug formulation or dietary supplement. In addition, the active constituents contributing to the activity of TTO have not been well justified, and the core mechanisms need to be unveiled especially for anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects leading to neuroprotection. Therefore, this review attempts to correlate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity of TTO with its neuroprotective mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory dermatological pathology that affects mostly young people. However, it can also appear in adulthood, mainly in women. It has a high psychosocial impact, not only at the time of active lesions but also due to the consequences of lesions such as scarring and hyperpigmentation. Several factors are involved in the physiopathology of acne and the constant search for active ingredients is a reality, namely phytotherapeutic ingredients. Tea tree oil is an essential oil extracted from Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden & Betch) Cheel with known antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, making it a candidate for the treatment of acne. This review aims to describe the various properties of tea tree oil that make it a possible ingredient to use in the treatment of acne and to present several human studies that have evaluated the efficacy and safety of using tea tree oil in the treatment of acne. It can be concluded that tea tree oil has good antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties that result in a decrease in the number of inflammatory lesions, mainly papules, and pustules. However, given the diversity of study designs, it is not possible to draw concrete conclusions on the efficacy and safety of this oil in the treatment of acne."

The development of alternative therapy against Demodex mites is currently required. The ability to kill Demodex mites of Thai herbal essential oils has never been explored. This study aimed to study and compare the in vitro killing effect of Thai herbal essential oils, tea tree oil, and metronidazole 0.75% with ivermectin 1% on D. folliculorum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: D. folliculorum mites were collected from the wastes of diagnostic standardized skin surface biopsy samples of demodicosis and rosacea patients for the trial. The microscopic evaluation started immediately after the mites were exposed to immersion oil (negative control), Thai herbal essential oils, tea tree oil, metronidazole 0.75%, and ivermectin 1% (positive control). The survival times of ten mites from each test agent were compared. RESULTS: The efficacy of Thai herbal essential oils and other test agents can be arranged in order as follows: lemongrass oil > sweet basil oil > clove oil > tea tree oil > lesser galangal oil > ginger oil, kaffir lime oil, peppermint oil > citronella oil > galangal oil > cajeput oil > ivermectin 1% > metronidazole 0.75%. CONCLUSION: This current study demonstrated the in vitro killing efficacy on D. folliculorum: Thai herbal essential oils, Tea tree oil > ivermectin 1% > metronidazole 0.75%. Thai herbal essential oils have the potential to be an adjuvant or alternative therapy against Demodex mites. Further in vivo studies are necessary to determine the treatment efficacy and side effects."

The aim was to compare the symptomatic relief of anterior blepharitis using Blephamed eye gel, a cosmetic product, versus standard treatment. METHODS: The study was a prospective, interventional open label clinical trial at a university-based hospital. The test population was subjects aged 18-65 years who presented with mild to moderate anterior blepharitis. Eyelid hygiene was applied twice a day. At each visit, a detailed assessment of symptomatology was carried out. A two-way repeated measure mixed model ANOVA was used to compare two groups by time. RESULTS: In total, 61 patients with mean age of 60.08 ± 16.69 years were enrolled in the study including 30 patients in standard group and 31 patients in Blephamed group. Two groups did not differ in terms of age (P = 0.31) and eye laterality (P = 0.50). The baseline scores of erythema, edema, debris, and symptoms as well as total score were similar between two groups (all P values >0.50). Two groups became different for all these parameters at day 45 (all P values <0.001). Significant interaction was detected between time and intervention groups for all severity parameters of blepharitis as well as total score (all P values <0.001). CONCLUSION: Eyelid hygiene with Blephamed more significantly decreased symptoms of anterior blepharitis compared to standard treatment.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Leaves of the Australian tea tree plant Melaleuca alternifolia were used traditionally by First Nations Australians for treating wounds, burns, and insect bites. Tea tree oil, the essential oil steam-distilled from M. alternifolia, is well-known for its medicinal properties, the evidence for most applications however is limited. This review aimed to critically appraise evidence from clinical trials examining the therapeutic efficacy and safety of tea tree oil on outcomes. Methods: Randomized controlled trials with participants of any age, gender, or health status, comparing tea tree oil to any control were included, without limit on publication date. Electronic databases were searched on 12 August 2022 with additional records sourced from article reference sections, reviews, and industry white papers. Risk of bias was assessed by two authors independently using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 1.0 tool. Results were summarized and synthesized thematically. Results: Forty-six articles were eligible from the following medical fields (Dentistry n = 18, Dermatology n = 9, Infectious disease n = 9, Ophthalmology n = 6, Podiatry n = 3; and Other n = 1). Results indicate that oral mouthwashes with 0.2%-0.5% tea tree oil may limit accumulation of dental plaque. Gels containing 5% tea tree oil applied directly to the periodontium may aid treatment of periodontitis as an adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planing. More evidence is needed to confirm the benefits of tea tree oil for reducing acne lesions and severity. Local anti-inflammatory effects on skin, if any, also require further elucidation. Topical tea tree oil regimens show similar efficacy to standard treatments for decolonizing the body from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, although intra-nasal use of tea tree oil may cause irritation to mucous membranes. Tea tree oil with added iodine may provide an effective treatment for molluscum contagiosum lesions in young children. More evidence on efficacy of tea tree oil-based eyelid wipes for Demodex mite control are needed. Side effects were reported in 60% of included studies and were minor, except where tea tree oil was applied topically in concentrations ≥ 25%. Discussion: Overall, the quality of research was poor to modest and higher quality trials with larger samples and better reporting are required to substantiate potential therapeutic applications of tea tree oil.

There have been no studies that examine the use of aroma-Tea Tree oil and Eucalyptus oil to relieve the discomfort side effects related to COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the use of two aroma-essential oils to relieve discomfort side effects of COVID-19 vaccination. DESIGN: The study used experimental design to match two groups of participants. SETTING: The participants' home. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who had not yet been vaccinated against COVID-19 but were planning to receive it were recruited. The current study included 87 control participants matched to 83 experimental participants. INTERVENTION: The participants in the experimental group used Tea tree and Eucalyptus while the control group did not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A questionnaire was used to collect data on the topical and systematic symptoms related to COVID-19 vaccines. Both groups were asked to complete the online questionnaire and report their health status 24 h (T1) and 48 h (T2) after vaccination. RESULTS: The results revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups in swelling, injection side pain, lump, fever, and muscle ache (p = .05, 0.04, <0.00, 0.02, 0.02, respectively) for T1; but for T2, a significant difference between the two groups was found only in lump and fever (p = .05, 0.03). Aroma-Tea Tree oil and Eucalyptus oil may be recognized and accepted by more people worldwide to provide a safe and healthy option not only for post-vaccination care but also to relieve pain, fever, and skin lumps associated with other diseases or conditions.",

Clinical study suggests that conventional topical treatments for VVC are not always enough to eradicate Candida spp. from the vaginal microenvironment. This study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity of tea tree oil (TTO) 5% and TTO 10% against Candida species causing VVC in pregnancy. METHODOLOGY: In vitro experimental study was conducted in the Mycology Laboratory at Dermatovenereology Outpatient Clinic Dr. Soetomo General Hospital Surabaya. Eighteen isolates of Candida species were isolated from the vaginal thrush of 15 pregnant women diagnosed with VVC from March to May 2021. Antifungal susceptibility of TTO 5% and TTO 10% was evaluated by the disc diffusion method, with the inhibitory zone diameter as the main outcome. RESULTS: The mean inhibitory zone diameter of TTO 5%, TTO 10%, and nystatin against all Candida spp. was 7.26 mm, 8.64 mm, and 25.57 mm, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean inhibitory zone diameter of TTO 5%, TTO 10%, and nystatin tend to be larger in C. albicans compared to the non-albicans, but the difference is not significant. Nystatin displayed the largest mean inhibitory zone diameters compared to TTO 5% and TTO 10% (p < 0.001) in all Candida species. Increased concentration from TTO 5% to TTO 10% resulted in a slight increment in the mean inhibitory zone diameters in all-Candida species (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Tea Tree Oil displayed antifungal activity against Candida species causing VVC in pregnancy. Further studies are required to investigate optimal TTO concentrations as a VVC treatment in pregnancy.",

Method: To induce PUs, ischaemia-reperfusion cycles were performed by the external application of magnetic plates, with an ischaemic period of eight hours and a reperfusion period of 16 hours. Male and female Wistar rats were divided into three equally sized groups (n=20): one group received topical glycerin twice daily, another group received topical 10% (volume/volume (v/v)) TTO in glycerin twice daily; and the remaining group was untreated. The animals were assessed after one, four, seven and 14 cycles of ischaemia-reperfusion by thermal camera imaging, and then euthanised and sampled to investigate the degree of inflammation, collagen synthesis and apoptosis in the PUs. Results: Although topical glycerin alone suppressed local inflammation and apoptosis, this suppressive effect was accentuated at all timepoints by the application of topical TTO + glycerin. Similarly, an increase in collagen synthesis was observed in the glycerin group and this was accentuated by TTO at all timepoints. Parallel to the histological findings, the local temperature had decreased significantly on days 4 and 7 for both treatment groups (glycerin and TTO+glycerin). Conclusion: In this study, treatment with 10% (v/v) TTO in glycerin effectively suppressed skin inflammation and apoptosis, while it increased collagen synthesis during PU formation.",

Methods: This randomized controlled experimental research included a total of 90 women in the research sample abiding by the research criteria, with 30 each in the intervention groups (coconut oil or tea tree oil application) and 30 in the control group. Women in the intervention groups applied coconut oil or tea tree oil to the nipples on the 3rd, 7th, and 10th days postpartum, whereas the control group did not have any intervention. Data in the research were collected with the Descriptive Information Form for Mothers, Early Postpartum Period Breast Problem Assessment Form, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Analysis of data used the chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Friedman's test. Results: Mean age of women participating in the research was 28.23 ± 5.21 years. The differences between the groups applying coconut oil and tea tree oil on the 3rd, 7th, and 10th days postpartum and the control group were significant in terms of incidence of nipple cracks. In addition, the difference in mean VAS points for nipple pain in the groups using coconut oil and tea tree oil and the control group was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions: According to the research findings, coconut oil and tea tree oil were determined to reduce nipple crack formation and nipple pain. It is recommended to increase the use of coconut oil and tea tree oil related to breast problems in nursing care during the postpartum period. Clinical Trials Registration Number: NCT05456438.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Recently, there has been a serious increase in cases of scabies. The number of patients who do not benefit from the current treatment agents is also quite high. There are publications showing that scabies mites are permethrin-resistant and ivermectin. The treatment with scabicides usually lasts for several hours and usually the treatment is repeated for at least another time, which reduces the patient's compliance with the treatment, especially in pediatric patients where the toxic effects of the products are more pronounced. Therefore there is a need for treatment modalities that are less toxic to humans. To observe the in vitro effect of tea tree oil (TTO) on S. scabiei and to compare it with those of permethrin. METHODS: Scabies specimens were removed from the patient and examined using a digital microscope. Parasites that were not damaged during sampling, and showed full motion were included in the study. No treatment was applied to the patients before removal of the mites. A total of 40 parasites were included in the study, with 10 parasites in each group. Immersion oil was applied to the control group, 5% permethrin to the first treatment group, while 5% and 25% TTO were used for the second and third study groups. RESULTS: The mean survival time (ST) of scabies mites in the 5% permethrin group was 350±31.3 min, while this for 5% TTO group 180±15.1 min and 120±13.3 min in the 25% TTO group. The mean ST of the sarcoptes in the control group was 2.820±90 min. The mean ST between the control, permethrin and TTO groups was statistically significant (p=0.03). ST between 5% and 25% TTO groups was also statistically significant (p=0.04). There were no statistical differences between permethrin and 5% or 25% TTO. CONCLUSION: TTO has an acaricidal effect on S. scabiei. Although not used as the treatment of choise, it can be used as a supportive agent. Since it shows an acaricidal effect within a short time, it could be used as a shampoo or shower gel to enhance the acaricidal activity of another scabicide.",

      "abstract": "Bone infection treatment is a significant challenge for the orthopedic field. 3D printing is a promising technology to produce scaffolds with customized architecture, able to stimulate and support bone growth. β-TCP and S53P4 bioactive glass (BG) are well-known biomaterials for scaffold manufacturing. However, a multifunctional scaffold, able to inhibit microbial proliferation at the defect site, is of increasing interest to avoid infection recurrence. Tea tree oil (TTO) has aroused interest as an antimicrobial agent to minimize the use of antibiotics. Therefore, combining the regenerative potential of a bioceramic with TTO's antimicrobial properties could result in a scaffold capable of stimulating tissue growth and treating infections. In this context, this study aimed to produce and characterize 3D-printed β-TCP/S53P4 BG scaffolds coated with TTO. Scaffolds morphological and chemical characterizations were carried out through XDR, SEM, and FTIR analysis. β-TCP/S53P4 BG scaffolds showed a compressive strength of ~2 MPa and 53 ± 2% of porosity. The scaffolds were coated by two different procedures, using an ethanol/TTO (EtOH/TTO) and a gelatin/TTO (Gel/TTO) solution with 5, 10, and 15% (v/v) TTO. The addition of TTO decreased MG-63 cell viability for both coating groups, but the Gel/TTO group showed higher cell viability. The antibacterial activity of the coated scaffolds was evaluated against S. aureus and higher inhibition of colony formation was found for Gel/TTO group. Therefore, the coating with Gel/TTO was effective in terms of antibacterial activity and cell viability. Such Gel/TTO coated β-TCP/S53P4 BG scaffolds are proposed for antibacterial bone tissue engineering.",

      "abstract": "Both oxidative stress and autophagy refer to regulating fat metabolism, and the former affects autophagy, but the role and mechanism of the antioxidant-autophagy axis in regulating lipid metabolism remains unclear. As an antioxidant, tea tree oil (TTO) has little research on the regulatory mechanism of lipid metabolism in crustaceans. This study investigated whether TTO could alter hepatopancreatic lipid metabolism by affecting the antioxidant-autophagy axis. Feed Macrobrachium rosenbergii with three different levels of TTO diets for 8 weeks: CT (0 mg/kg TTO), 100TTO (100 mg/kg TTO), and 1000TTO (1000 mg/kg TTO). The results showed that 100TTO treatment reduced the hemolymph lipids level and hepatopancreatic lipid deposition compared to CT. In contrast, 1000TTO treatment increased hepatopancreatic lipid deposition, damaging both morphology and function in the hepatopancreas. The 100TTO treatment promoted lipolysis and reduced liposynthesis at the transcriptional level compared to the CT group. Meanwhile, it improved the hepatopancreas antioxidant capacity and maintained mitochondrial structural and ROS homeostasis. In addition, it simultaneously activated the expression of transcription factors Keap1-Nrf2 and Imd-Relish. By contrast, the 1000TTO group significantly enhanced the ROS level, which considerably activated the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling expression but had no significant effects on the expression of Imd-Relish. The 100TTO group supplementation significantly enhanced lipid droplet breakdown and autophagy-related genes and protein expression. On the contrary, the 1000TTO group significantly inhibited the expression of genes and proteins related to autophagy. Pearson analysis revealed that Nrf2 has a positive correlation to lipid anabolism-related genes (Fasn, Srebp1, Pparγ) and autophagy regulators (mtor, akt, p62), and were negatively correlated with lipolysis-related genes (Cpt1, Hsl, Ampkα) and autophagy markers (Ulk1, Lc3). Relish was positively correlated with Atgl, Cpt1, Ampkα, Ulk1, and Lc3, and negatively correlated with Pparγ and p62. Moreover, Keap1 and Imd were negatively correlated with p62 and mtor, respectively. In sum, 100 mg/kg TTO enhanced antioxidant activity and increased autophagy intensity through the Relish-Imd pathway to enhance lipid droplet breakdown, while 1000 mg/kg TTO overexpressed Nrf2, thus inhibiting autophagy and ultimately causing excessive lipid deposition and peroxidation. Our study gives a fresh perspective for deciphering the bidirectional regulation mechanism of lipid metabolism by different doses of TTO based on the antioxidant-autophagy axis."

TTONL was prepared by thin film hydration and sonication technique, and the preparation conditions were optimized by Box-behnken response surface method. The characterization (morphology, size, zeta potential, and stability) and antibacterial activity of TTONL against Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. The optimal preparation conditions for TTONL: lecithin to cholesterol mass ratio of 3.7:1, TTO concentration of 0.5%, and pH of the hydration medium of 7.4, which resulted in a TTONL encapsulation rate of 80.31 ± 0.56%. TTONL was nearly spherical in shape and uniform in size, and the average particle size was 227.8 ± 25.3 nm with negative charge. The specific disappearance of the TTO peak in the infrared spectrum suggested the successful preparation of TTONL, which showed high stability at 4°C within 35 d. The result of MIC test found that the nanoliposomes improved antibacterial activity of TTO against various E. coli strains. TTONL exposure in vitro caused different degrees of structural damage to the E. coli. TTONL by oral administration alleviated the clinical symptoms and intestinal lesion of chickens induced with E. coli challenge. Furthermore, TTONL treatment remarkably lowered the mRNA expression of NLRP3 and NF-κB (p65) in the duodenum and cecum of E. coli-infected chickens. In conclusion, the prepared TTONL had good stability and slow-release property with dose-dependent inhibition and killing effects on different strains of E. coli, and exerted a preventive role against chicken colibacillosis through inhibition.",

The influence of crosslinkers and catalysts on the possibility of obtaining stable bonds using hydrothermal in situ synthesis between cellulosic material and chitosan with and without tea tree essential oil was investigated in detail. The morphology of the sample surface before and after the treatment and textile care cycle was investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and indicated the presence of chitosan and a thin film on all treated samples, which showed durability of the treatment. The FTIR spectra obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using attenuated total reflection measurement technique (ATR) analysis, showed that all the samples tested recorded physicochemical changes in the structure. The analysis of the samples on the goniometer proved the hydrophilicity of the materials, with a film forming on the surface of the treated samples, which is extremely beneficial given the end use of dressing samples to promote wound healing. The presence of a significant amount of bound chitosan with tea tree oil was confirmed by measuring the mass per unit area of the samples after the treatment and textile care cycles. The results of antimicrobial efficacy show that the materials treated with chitosan were resistant to bacteria and fungi in most cases, but only the samples treated in Bath I showed a zone of inhibition against the fungus Candida albicans, indicating the positive effect of tea tree essential oil."

Results showed that nanoTTO enhanced the activities of multiple antibiotics against MDR Escherichia coli (E. coli), and its antimicrobial activity was not changed against bacteria that were cultured in the presence of nanoTTO for 30 passages. Further studies to visualize and quantify intracellular antibiotics concentrations identified that nanoTTO increased the drug accumulation in MDR E. coli by disrupting outer and inner membranes and inhibiting the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump involved in membrane permeability. In addition, nanoTTO was effective in enhancing antibiotic efficacy in the Galleria mellonella infection model and mouse peritonitis model, suggesting a potential strategy against MDR bacterial infections.",

      "abstract": "Background Plaque biofilm that adheres to tooth surfaces and gingiva is the main aetiology of periodontitis. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is considered as a gold standard anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis agent but it has side effects such as permanent staining of teeth and dysgeusia. Tea tree oil (TTO) is an essential oil extracted from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia. Many studies have reported that TTO exerts strong antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities.Primary study objective The review aims to answer the question of whether TTO (intervention) is a viable alternative to CHX (comparator) for the management of gingival and periodontal disease (outcomes) in adolescents and adults (population).Methods/design The following search terms were used in PubMed, Scopus, Proquest, Web of Science, EBSCO (dentistry and open access), Cochrane database, Clinical.gov.org and ctri.nic.in to search for relevant articles: patients with periodontal disease; OR periodontitis; OR gingivitis; OR gingival inflammation; AND essential oil; OR tea tree oil; OR Melaleuca alternifolia; AND chlorhexidine; AND reduction in gingival index; OR reduction in plaque index; OR reduction in bleeding from gums. The initial check for the title and abstract screening followed by removal of duplicates in Mendeley Reference Manager (version 1.19.4) based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria were performed.Primary outcome measures Parameters such as plaque index (PI), plaque surface score, gingival index (GI), bleeding index or bleeding as measured by % of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP) or bleeding scores, papillary bleeding index (PBI), were the primary outcomes considered.Results TTO is found to be superior to CHX in reducing signs of gingival inflammation; however, CHX is superior to TTO in inhibiting plaque formation, probably due to its increased substantivity.Conclusion TTO may be used as an alternative to CHX for reduction of gingival inflammation in conjunction with efficient plaque control measures."

      "abstract": "Tea tree oil (TTO) plays an important role in lipid metabolism, alleviating the inflammatory responses. Fatty liver is associated with lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, leading to inflammation. However, there is very limited information on the effects of TTO on lipid accumulation, and inflammation in bovine hepatocytes. This study aimed to evaluate whether TTO alleviates palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipid accumulation in bovine hepatocytes. Hepatocytes isolated from mid-lactating Holstein cows were pretreated with 100 μM PA for 72 h. Cells were either pretreated with PA alone (PA group) or with PA followed by 0.00625% TTO treatment for 12 h (PT group). Expression of fatty acid oxidant genes increased (P < 0.05) while fatty acid synthesis genes decreased (P < 0.05) in the PT group compared with the PA group. PA treatment resulted in increased (P < 0.05) expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), but these increases were less in the PT group (P < 0.05). Compared to the PA group, expression of phosphorylated (p)-p65 and p-inhibitor κBα (p-IκBα) was suppressed (P < 0.05) by TTO treatment. TTO treatment limited (P < 0.05) the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prevented (P < 0.05) a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential observed in response to PA treatment. Expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes was reduced (P < 0.05) in the PT group compared with the PA group. Our results suggest that TTO treatment attenuates the effects of PA in hepatocytes, leading to fatty acid oxidation, decreased fatty acid synthesis, suppressed inflammatory response, and reduced ER stress. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that TTO treatment may be a promising therapeutic approach to imbalanced lipid homeostasis, inflammation and ER stress in dairy cows shortly before and after calving."

OBJECTIVE: Compare the survival time (ST) of Demodex folliculorum exposed to six different concentrations of tea tree oil (TTO) versus a positive control (permethrin 5%) and a negative control (immersion oil) group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The wastes of rosacea patients' standardized superficial skin biopsy samples were recruited for the trial. The primary outcome measure of this study was the survival time, defined as the period between the exposure of study agents to the complete cessation of Demodex movements. RESULTS: All differences between the mean survival times of 2.5% (54.0 ± 6.1), 5% (39.0 ± 3.9), 10% (22.0 ± 2.5), 25% (13.0 ± 2.5), 50% (7.8 ± 0.6), and 100% TTO (3.3 ± 1.3) were significant (p < 0.05). The ST of the negative control group was 196.0 ± 23.6 min. The ST of permethrin 5% was 12.5 ± 1.9 that did not show a statistically significant difference from the ST of TTO 25% (p = 0.628). CONCLUSION: The survival times of the six different TTO groups confirmed a dose-related pattern, all of which had survival times shorter than the negative control (immersion oil). TTO 25% had comparable efficacy to the positive control agent (permethrin 5%).",

      "abstract": "Tea tree oil (TTO) exerts key roles in improving growth performance of pigs. However, knowledge is limited regarding comparative effects of Encp TTO and Un-encp TTO supplementation on growth performance of pigs. A study determined the effects of TTO or its capsulation on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal microbiome of weaned pigs. A total of 144 healthy pigs (8.5 ± 0.24 kg) were subjected to four treatments for a 28-d trial with six replicates per treatment and six pigs per pen: negative control, NC; positive control, PC (antibiotic supplemented); Un-encp TTO (supplemented with unencapsulated TTO); Encp TTO (supplemented with encapsulated TTO). NC, TTO, and PC treatments were compared with regard to improved average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion rate, nutrient digestibility, and intestinal morphology (p < 0.05) and decreased diarrhea rate. TTO- and PC-treated pigs had higher levels of serum superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and immunoglobulin G; lower levels of liver aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase; and improved concentrations of interleukin 10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-1β (p < 0.05). TTO- and PC-treated pigs had higher abundance of beneficial bacterial species Subdoligranulum and lower abundance of diarrhea associated species Escherichia-Shigella in cecal and colonic digesta (p < 0.05). Encapsulation of TTO preserved more activities of TTO than its unencapsulated counterpart by showing higher ADG, ADFI, and feed conversion rate during day 1 (d1) to d14 (p < 0.05) and tended to lower diarrhea rate (p = 0.083) and improve villous height/crypt depth (VH/CD) ratio (p = 0.089) in jejunum. Encapsulation of TTO also improved antioxidant indexes and decreased liver injury and inflammation accordingly (p < 0.05). Encapsulated TTO-treated pigs had higher abundance of beneficial Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and lower the abundance of harmful Escherichia-Shigella in cecal and colonic digesta (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrated TTO benefits on improving growth performance of weaned pigs and further proved that encapsulation of TTO was superior to its unencapsulated counterpart at multiples. Encapsulated TTO was similar to the PC group and could be potentially an alternative of feed antibiotics for weaned pigs."

      "abstract": "Viral disease management has been proven difficult, and there are no broadly licensed vaccines or therapeutics. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an active pathogen of wild ungulates and livestock; its infection frequently caused irreversible vesicles on the tongue or other positions, leading to enormous economic loss. Tea tree oil (TTO) has been shown to be a popular remedy for many skin diseases owing to its antibacterial, antipruritic, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the potential effect of TTO on VSV proliferation and the corresponding inflammatory response in cells remain unclear. In this study, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay was used to evaluate the cell viability of TTO, and cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) was calculated. Then, fluorescence observation, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot (WB), and flow cytometry (FCM) assay were used to evaluate the antiviral effect of TTO against VSV under three manners of pre-infection before medication, co-administration, pretreatment before infection at safe doses to Vero cells. Meanwhile, the mRNA expressions of interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor α, and ISG56 in cells were also detected. The results showed that the maximum safe concentration of TTO to Vero cells was 0.063% and the CC50 is 0.32%. Most notably, TTO dose-dependently inhibited the VSV GFP fluorescence generation and restrained the replication of VSV in gene and protein levels regardless of the treatment modes. Based on the results of the FCM, effective concentration 50 of TTO against VSV is 0.019%. Similarly, the mRNA expression of the above cytokines induced by viral infection was also remarkably curbed. These findings suggest that TTO emerged blocking, prophylaxis, and treatment action against VSV replication and suppressed the related inflammation in Vero cells. This study provides a novel potential for TTO fighting against viral infection and anti-inflammatory activities in Vero cells."

The optimal formula was evaluated in terms of morphology, cytotoxicity, and in-vitro wound healing assay. Also, the efficacy of the optimal formula was evaluated by in-vivo wound healing and histopathological studies. The optimal formula (F3) was composed of 9% tea tree oil and 0.4% propolis extracts with mean droplet size 19.42 ± 1.7 nm, zeta potential value -24.5 ± 0.2 mV, and viscosity 69.4 ± 1.8 mP. Furthermore, the optimal formula showed the highest skin deposition value 550.00 ± 4.9 µg/cm2 compared to other formulae. The TEM micrograph of the optimal formula showed that the nanoemulsion droplet has an almost spherical shape. Also, the optimal formula did not show noticeable toxicity to the human skin fibroblast cells. The in-vitro and in-vivo wound healing assay showed unexpected results that the un-loaded drug nanoemulsion formula had a comparable wound healing efficacy to the drug-loaded nanoemulsion formula. These results were confirmed with histopathological studies. Our results showed that the propolis and tea tree oil nanoemulsion, whether loaded or unloaded with an antibiotic, is an efficient local therapy for wound healing."

      "abstract": "Fungal skin infections are currently a major clinical problem due to their increased occurrence and drug resistance. The treatment of fungal skin infections is based on monotherapy or polytherapy using the synergy of the therapeutic substances. Tea tree oil (TTO) may be a valuable addition to the traditional antifungal drugs due to its antifungal and anti-inflammatory activity. Ketoconazole (KTZ) is an imidazole antifungal agent commonly used as a treatment for dermatological fungal infections. The use of hydrogels and organogel-based formulations has been increasing for the past few years, due to the easy method of preparation and long-term stability of the product. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to design and characterize different types of Pluronic® F-127 gel formulations containing KTZ and TTO as local delivery systems that can be applied in cases of skin fungal infections. The influence of TTO addition on the textural, rheological, and bioadhesive properties of the designed formulations was examined. Moreover, the in vitro release of KTZ, its permeation through artificial skin, and antifungal activity by the agar diffusion method were performed. It was found that obtained gel formulations were non-Newtonian systems, showing a shear-thinning behaviour and thixotropic properties with adequate textural features such as hardness, compressibility, and adhesiveness. Furthermore, the designed preparations with TTO were characterized by beneficial bioadhesive properties. The presence of TTO improved the penetration and retention of KTZ through the artificial skin membrane and this effect was particularly visible in hydrogel formulation. The developed gels containing TTO can be considered as favourable formulations in terms of drug release and antifungal activity.",

The disease inflicts immense pain and suffering on millions of people, particularly children. The condition is most prevalent in Latin America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there is no standard drug treatment for tungiasis. The available treatment options are fairly limited and unrealistic to use in endemic areas; as a result, in desperation, the affected people do more harm to themselves by extracting the fleas with non-sterile instruments, further exposing themselves to secondary bacterial infections and/or transmission of diseases such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or HIV. This highlights the urgent need for simpler, safer, and effective treatment options for tungiasis. Tea tree oil (TTO) has long been used as an antiseptic with extensive safety and efficacy data. The evidence on parasiticidal properties of TTO against ectoparasites such as head lice, mites, and fleas is also compelling. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current tungiasis treatment challenges in endemic settings and highlight the potential role of TTO in the treatment of tungiasis.",

However, poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability, and side effects restrict its use. To avoid such issues, an appropriate carrier system is necessary which can address the aforementioned challenges for attaining enhanced biopharmaceutical attributes. The current study intends to provide a detailed account on the development and evaluation of CRT-loaded microemulsion (ME) hydrogel formulation containing tea tree oil (TTO) for improved drug delivery for scabies treatment in a safe and effective manner. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed with TTO as the oily phase, and Cremophor®EL was used as the surfactant in a mass ratio 2:1 with co-surfactants (mixture of phospholipid 90G and Transcutol®P), and aqueous solution as the external phase. The optimized drug-loaded ME formulation was evaluated for skin penetration, retention, compliance, and dermatokinetics. The nonirritant behavior of the formulation was revealed by skin histopathology, which showed no changes in normal skin histology. In comparison to the conventional product, dermatokinetic experiments revealed that CRT has greater penetration and distribution in the epidermis of the mice skin. The findings imply that the proposed lipid-based ME hydrogel can aid in the resolution of CRT issues by providing a better and safer delivery option to epidermis and deeper epidermis in substantial quantities.",

PURPOSE: Within this study, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) as an important non-ionic, water-soluble cellulose derivative was chosen to develop formulations containing tea tree oil as active antifungal agent were developed and evaluated for their potential in the treatment of onychomycosis. METHODS: Two polymeric films based on HEC (HEC-B-04 and HEC-E-10) were obtained by solvent evaporation method and characterized in terms of appearance, disintegration, stickiness, elongation, rheological behavior and adhesiveness. Moreover, different strains of dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum and yeasts as Candida albicans were treated with polymeric films containing tea tree oil (0.5 - 2 % v/v) in order to determine their antifungal potential by the inhibition zone assay. RESULTS: HEC-B-04 and HEC-E-10 were investigated by SEM measurements resulting in confluent surface morphology. HEC-B-04 and HEC-E-10 showed disintegration after 32.7 min and 34.0 min, respectively. Furthermore, HEC-E-10 revealed a moisture index of 1.74 and underpinned adhesive properties in terms of required detachment force with 4.86 N. HEC-E-10 pointed to the most antifungal one among the others against Trichophyton rubrum and Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: Taking these findings in consideration, promising adhesive onychial formulations were developed as forthcoming approach in treatment of nail infections.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tea tree essential oil (TTO) is extracted from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia by steam distillation. It is well known for its traditional medicinal uses, particularly for the treatment of bruises, insect bites, skin infections, vertigo, convulsions, toothache, and rheumatism. Earlier research has shown that TTO can effectively inhibit oral microorganisms in the root canals. Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) has been considered to be associated with persistent root canal infections and root canal treatment failure. The biofilm of E. faecalis makes it more vigorous, toxic, and resistant to antibiotics. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, our aim was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of TTO on planktonic E. faecalis and biofilms compared with 0.2% CHX. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), the bacteriostatic rate by MTT assay, the antimicrobial time by time-kill assay, and the effects on cell integrity, the biomass, and bacterial activity of E. faecalis biofilms. Finally, we investigated the microstructure changes of E. faecalis biofilms using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). RESULTS: The MIC and MBC values were 0.25% and 0.5%, the bacterial inhibition rate, time-kill was dosage dependent, and TTO can effectively destroy membrane integrity. SEM CLSM images revealed that TTO could reduce bacterial aggregation, biofilm thickness and inhibited biofilm formation. The effect of TTO was the same as that of 0.2% CHX at some specific concentrations. In summary, TTO has the potential to be effective against E. faecalis infections. CONCLUSIONS: TTO was able to inhibit E. faecalis by destroying cell membrane, inhibiting the formation of E. faecalis biofilms, and eliminating mature formed biofilms. In this study, TTO has the potential to be further developed as a novel antibacterial drug.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tungiasis (sand flea disease or jigger infestation) is a neglected tropical disease caused by penetration of female sand fleas, Tunga penetrans, in the skin. The disease inflicts immense pain and suffering on millions of people, particularly children, in Latin America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there is no standard treatment for tungiasis, and a simple, safe and effective tungiasis treatment option is required. Tea tree oil (TTO) has long been used as a parasiticidal agent against ectoparasites such as headlice, mites and fleas with proven safety and efficacy data. However, current data are insufficient to warrant a recommendation for its use in tungiasis. This trial aims to generate these data by comparing the safety and efficacy of a 5% (v/w) TTO proprietary gel formulation with 0.05% (w/v) potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution for tungiasis treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This trial is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in primary schools (n=8) in South-Western Kenya. The study will include school children (n=88) aged 6-15 years with a confirmed diagnosis of tungiasis. The participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 3-day two times a day treatment of either 5% TTO gel or 0.05% KMnO4 solution. Two viable embedded sandflea lesions per participant will be targeted and the viability of these lesions will be followed throughout the study using a digital handheld microscope. The primary outcome is the proportion of observed viable embedded sand fleas that have lost viability (non-viable lesions) by day 10 (9 days after first treatment). Secondary outcomes include improvement in acute tungiasis morbidities assessed using a validated severity score for tungiasis, safety assessed through adverse events and product acceptability assessed by interviewing the participants to rate the treatment in terms of effectiveness, side effects, convenience, suitability and overall satisfaction. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial protocol has been reviewed and approved by the University of Canberra Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC-2019-2114). The findings of the study will be presented at scientific conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active control, multicenter clinical trial included patients with seborrheic blepharitis using block randomization (BS, n=23; swabs, n=26). Patients were treated with BS or swabs for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks of treatment withdrawal. Change in Blepharitis Symptom measure (BLISS), Demodex count, Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score, Schirmer test, tear breakup time (TBUT), noninvasive TBUT (NI-TBUT), corneal staining, and meibography at different visits (baseline, fourth, , and 12th week) were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Patients in both groups showed similar baseline parameters (P>0.05). Patients using swabs showed significantly lower BLISS scores compared with patients using BS at the 4th, 8th, and 12th week visits (3.6±6.1 vs. 6.3±4.5 P=0.011; 1.1±2.8 vs. 6.6±6.7, P<0.001; 0.9±2.8 vs. 5.7±6.6, P=0.002, respectively). Patients using swabs showed improvement in OSDI scores after 8 weeks of treatment compared with the baseline visit (P<0.001). Despite a similar Demodex reduction effect in both treatment arms even after 4 weeks of treatment (P<0.001), both treatment modalities did not show any effect on the other parameters. CONCLUSION: Although both swabs and BS showed efficacy for the treatment of seborrheic blepharitis in terms of the Demodex reduction and symptomatic improvement, swabs may provide better symptomatic improvement. Four weeks of treatment discontinuation may not cause any recurrence in the symptoms or Demodex infestation.",

Nano-based carriers have been developed to improve solubility and bioavailability of adapalene and other acne treatment drugs. In our previous report, tea tree oil nanoemulsion containing adapalene gel (TTO NE + ADA Gel) showed appropriate physical and biological properties such as stability, viscosity, pH, size, morphology and biocompatibility in an animal model. The present study was designed to assess efficacy and safety of the TTO NE + ADA Gel in comparison with 0.1% adapalene marketed gel (ADA Marketed Gel). A total of 100 patients were randomized to receive TTO NE + ADA Gel or ADA Marketed Gel, once daily at night, for 12 weeks. Analysis for efficacy was conducted by acne lesion count (total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory) and acne severity index at weeks 4, 8 and 12 using generalized estimating equation along with the safety assessments in each measurement for assessing dryness, erythema, burning sensation and irritation. Significantly better reduction in total, inflammatory, and non-inflammatory acne lesions were reported for TTO NE + ADA Gel as compared to the ADA Marketed Gel overall and on each measurement occasion (p value  < 0.001 for all). Mean acne severity index also reduced with TTO NE + ADA Gel significantly in comparison with ADA Marketed Gel (p value  < 0.001). Dryness was the most common adverse effect reported in both groups and it was higher in TTO NE + ADA Gel group. In conclusion, TTO NE + ADA Gel compared to ADA Marketed Gel appears more effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris, with no important change in adverse effects.",

MAC was analyzed for its anticancer activity against human prostate (LNCaP) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines growing in vitro. MAC (0.02-0.06% v/v) dose-dependently induced the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway in both the LNCaP and MCF-7 cell lines, involving increased mitochondrial superoxide production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), caspase 3/7 activation, as well as the presence of TUNEL+ and cleaved-PARP+ cell populations. At concentrations of 0.01-0.04% v/v, MAC caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/1-phase, as well as autophagy. The in vivo anticancer actions of MAC were examined as a treatment in the FVB/N c-Neu murine model for spontaneously arising breast cancers. Intratumoral MAC injections (1-4% v/v) significantly suppressed tumor progression in a dose-dependent manner and was associated with greater levels of tumor infiltrating neutrophils exhibiting anticancer cytotoxic activity. Induction of breast cancer cell death by MAC via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was also replicated occurring in tumors treated in vivo. In conclusion, our data highlights the potential for the Melaleuca-derived MAC product inducing anticancer neutrophil influx, supporting its application as a novel therapeutic agent.",

Tea tree oil (TTO) has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant effect. This study aimed to assess clinically and biochemically the effect of intrapocket application of TTO (Melaleuca alternifolia) gel adjunctive to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of stage 2 (moderate) periodontitis and to correlate the biochemical levels with clinical response. METHODS: A randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted on thirty patients with stage 2 periodontitis. Patients were equally divided into two groups: Control Group treated with (SRP) alone and Test Group treated with SRP and locally delivered 5% TTO gel. Clinical assessment included pocket probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), gingival index (GI) and bleeding on probing (BOP) measured at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. The level of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was also assessed at baseline and after1, 3 and 6 months by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Chi-square, Student t- tests, Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation were the statistical tests used in the study. RESULTS: An improvement of all clinical and biochemical parameters was observed (at p < 0.001) in both groups. A significant difference between the two groups was found in both clinical and biochemical parameters. CONCLUSION: The local delivery of TTO gel adjunctive to SRP proved to be effective in the treatment of stage II periodontitis.

The treatment of these illnesses is hampered by the existence of a resistance stage (cysts). In an attempt to add new agents that are effective against trophozoites and cysts, tea tree oil (TTO) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), separately and in combination, were tested In Vitro against two Acanthamoeba isolates, T3 and T4 genotypes. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) assay was used as a drug screening method, which is to some extent useful in amoebicide drug screening; however, evaluation of lethal effects may be misleading when testing products that promote encystment. Trophozoite viability analysis showed that the effectiveness of the combination of both compounds is higher than when either compound is used alone. Therefore, the TTO alone or TTO + DMSO in combination were an amoebicide, but most of the amoebicidal activity in the combination's treatments seemed to be caused mainly by the TTO effect. In fact, DMSO alone seems to be a non-amoebicide, triggering encystment. Regarding cytotoxicity, these compounds showed toxicity in human corneal epithelial cells (HCEpiC), even at low concentrations when tested in combination. In conclusion, the use of TTO and DMSO, in combination or alone, cannot be recommended as an alternative for AK treatment until more cytotoxicity and cyst adhesion tests are performed."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study is aimed at comparing the effects of tea tree oil (TTO) shampoo with regular eyelid shampoo on the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) signs and symptoms. DESIGN: Double-masked randomized clinical trial METHODOLOGY: Forty patients with MGD were treated by daily eyelid scrubbing with TTO shampoo in one eye and regular eyelid shampoo in the other one. Before treatment and then after 1 and 3 months, the effect on ocular surface symptoms, tear production and stability, and conjunctival and eyelid signs of the 2 eyes were compared. RESULTS: Plugging and capping of meibomian gland orifices, foamy tear, glands expressibility, 5-Item Dry Eye Questionnaire score (DEQ5), and tear breakup time were improved more significantly in TTO shampoo-treated eyes (capping P = .050, plugging and glands expressibility P = .001, others P < .001). In spite of improvement in both eyes, scores of meibum quality, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal and conjunctival staining, and Schirmer1 test value showed no statistically significant difference between the eyes (P = .06, .187, .192, .19, respectively). Moreover, eyelid margin telangiectasia resolved only in TTO shampoo-treated eyes (P < .001). Trichiasis and distichiasis changed in neither group (P > .99). Furthermore, ocular surface irritation during scrubbing was more common with TTO shampoo (P = .002). CONCLUSION: TTO shampoo was found to be more efficient than regular eyelid shampoo in controlling MGD signs and symptoms although ocular surface irritation during its application was more frequent.",

      "abstract": "Demodex infection gradually develops to Demodex blepharitis, which is characterized as chronic inflammation of the eyelid and meibomian gland (MG) and ultimately leads to MG dysfunction. In the present prospective study, the anti-demodectic effects of an okra eyelid patch in patients Demodex blepharitis were investigated. A total of 52 patients with Demodex blepharitis with ocular discomfort were recruited. Patients were randomized to receive either an okra eyelid patch treatment (treatment group, n=27) or tea tree oil (TTO) eye care patch treatment (control group, n=25) for three months. The Demodex count, the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score, MG expressibility (MGE) and meibum quality, Schirmer I test (SIT), tear break-up time (TBUT) and corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) were determined prior to treatment and after 1 and 3 months of treatment. Changes in the parameters were compared between the treatment group and control group after 1 and 3 months of treatment. The average survival time in the okra group was 115.25±11.87 min, which was significantly lower compared with the average ST of 378.75±37.94 min in the blank group (P<0.01). After 3 months of okra eyelid patch treatment, the Demodex count was significantly reduced from 10.15±4.53 to 1.30±1.41 (P<0.01) and the OSDI score of the patients was reduced by 16.84±10.17 (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in the Demodex count (P=0.716) and OSDI (P=0.873) between the treatment and control groups. The rate of complete Demodex eradication in the treatment group (11/27, 40.74%) was slightly lower than that in the control group (12/25, 48%), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (χ2=0.277, P=0.598). Regarding the other ocular parameters, no significant difference was observed in the TBUT, meibum quality and MGE between the two groups (P<0.05). TTO group has a significantly improvement compared with Okra group in terms of SIT (P=0.035) and CFS (P=0.023). In conclusion, okra eyelid patch treatment is able to significantly eradicate ocular Demodex as well as markedly alleviate ocular symptoms. Due to causing less irritation than TTO, the okra eyelid patch may be more suitable for sensitive patients with Demodex blepharitis, such as the elderly and children. The study was registered as a clinical trial in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) in November 2018 (registration no. ChiCTR-1,800,019,466)."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary tea tree oil (TTO) supplementation could effectively replace the antibiotics through modulating the antioxidant capacity and intestinal microbiota profile, and then decreasing the diarrhoea incidence and improving the growth performance of weaned pigs. A total of 216 weaned pigs with initial body weights (BW) of 9.19 ± 1.86 kg were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments in a completely randomised design. The dietary treatments included a corn-soybean meal basal diet (CON) without any antibiotics, and two experimental diets formulated by adding 75 mg/kg aureomycin (AGP) or 100 mg/kg TTO into the basal diet, respectively. Pigs fed the TTO diet showed greater gain to feed ratio (p < 0.05) than those fed CON and AGP diets during d 0-14 and d 14-28. Both dietary TTO and AGP supplementation tended to increase the average daily gain of weaned pigs during d 14-28 (p = 0.06) and the overall 28-d period (p = 0.07), and significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the diarrhoea incidence during d 0-14 compared with the CON treatment. In addition, dietary TTO supplementation improved the apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter and ether extract (p < 0.05), and increased (p < 0.05) the propionate and butyrate concentrations in faecal samples of weaned pigs. Moreover, pigs fed the TTO diet showed greater total antioxidant capacity, greater superoxide dismutase and interleukin-10 concentrations, and lower malondialdehyde concentration in serum than those fed the CON diet (p < 0.05). Furthermore, pigs fed the TTO diet demonstrated greater relative abundance of Clostridiaceae_1, while those fed the AGP diet exhibited greater relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae at family level. In conclusion, dietary TTO supplementation could improve growth performance in weaned pigs, which could be mainly attributed to the benefits on nutrient digestibility, antioxidative capacity and microbial community profile.",

      "abstract": "Despite the promising properties of tea tree oil (TTO) as potential therapeutics for several superficial skin conditions, certain limitations such as physical instability and skin irritation have restricted its widespread use. This study focuses on developing a rationally designed lipid-based nanoformulation (TTO-LNF) in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration standard using a well-recognized quality-by-design (QbD) approach. Using a mixture experimental design, TTO-LNF has been optimized with 5% TTO, 10% surfactant, 5% co-surfactant, and 80% water, which showed a 14.4 ± 4.4 nm droplet size and 0.03 ± 0.01 polydispersity index (PDI). To ease the topical administration, the TTO-LNF gel formulation was further developed using xanthan gum to achieve the desired viscosity and form a gel. The in vitro antibacterial tests of TTO-LNF showed promising inhibitory effects toward both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In fact, a complete growth inhibition of S. epidermidis was observed when exposed to TTO-LNF and TTO-LNF gel for 24 h, showing better activity than antibiotic kanamycin (25 µg/mL). Additionally, the in vitro release study showed a sustained release profile with a 50% release in 24 h, which could be beneficial to reduce the toxicity and thereby improve the therapeutic efficacy for long-acting applications. Furthermore, the formulations were remarkably stable at 40 °C/75% Relative humidity (RH) for at least 4 weeks. Therefore, this study presents a promising strategy to develop a biocompatible and stable formulation that can be used for the topical treatment of skin infections."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop tea tree oil (TTO)-loaded chitosan-poly(ε-caprolactone) core-shell nanocapsules (NC-TTO-Ch) aiming the topical acne treatment. TTO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and nanocapsules were characterized regarding mean particle size (Z-average), polydispersity index (PdI), zeta potential (ZP), pH, entrapment efficiency (EE), morphology by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and anti-Cutibacterium acnes activity. The main constituents of TTO were terpinen-4-ol (37.11 %), γ-terpinene (16.32 %), α-terpinene (8.19 %), ρ-cimene (6.56 %), and α-terpineol (6.07 %). NC-TTO-Ch presented Z-average of 268.0 ± 3.8 nm and monodisperse size distribution (PdI < 0.3). After coating the nanocapsules with chitosan, we observed an inversion in ZP to a positive value (+31.0 ± 1.8 mV). This finding may indicate the presence of chitosan on the nanocapsules' surface, which was corroborated by the AFM images. In addition, NC-TTO-Ch showed a slightly acidic pH (∼5.0), compatible with topical application. The EE, based on Terpinen-4-ol concentration, was approximately 95 %. This data suggests the nanocapsules' ability to reduce the TTO volatilization. Furthermore, NC-TTO-Ch showed significant anti-C. acnes activity, with a 4× reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration, compared to TTO and a decrease in C. acnes cell viability, with an increase in the percentage of dead cells (17 %) compared to growth control (6.6 %) and TTO (9.7 %). Therefore, chitosan-poly(ε-caprolactone) core-shell nanocapsules are a promising tool for TTO delivery, aiming at the activity against C. acnes for the topical acne treatment.",

RESULTS: Trichophyton rubrum growth inhibition was obtained at concentrations higher than 0.04% of the essential tea tree oil (p = 0.004). In the case of Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibition was obtained at 0.02% (p = 0.017), and even complete inhibition at a final concentration of the oil at 0.07%. CONCLUSIONS: Tea tree essential oil inhibits the in vitro growth of the fungus and may be a less harmful alternative to the onychomycosis treatment."

Its activity raised queries regarding its ability to, not only act as a bio-fungicide or bio-bactericide, but also systemically inducing resistance in plants. This was examined by TTO application to banana plants challenged by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc, Race 1) causing Fusarium wilt and to tomato plants challenged by Xanthomonas campestris. Parameters to assess resistance induction included: disease development, enzymatic activity, defense genes expression correlated to systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and induced systemic resistance (ISR) and priming effect. Spraying TTO on field-grown banana plants infected with Foc and greenhouse tomato plants infected with Xanthomonas campestris led to resistance induction in both hosts. Several marker genes of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways were significantly up-regulated in parallel with symptoms reduction. For tomato plants, we have also recorded a priming effect following TTO treatment. In addition to fungicidal and bactericidal effect, TTO can be applied in more sustainable strategies to control diseases by enhancing the plants ability to defend themselves against pathogens and ultimately diminish chemical pesticides applications."

This mastitis model was used to determine cellular responses to TTO and LPS on cellular cytotoxicity, mRNA abundance and cytokine production. High-throughput sequencing was used to select candidate genes, followed by functional evaluation of those genes. In the first experiment, LPS at a concentration of 200 μg/mL reduced cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and upregulated protein concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Addition of TTO led to reduced cellular apoptosis along with downregulated protein concentrations of nuclear factor kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) and caspase-3. In the second experiment, BMEC challenged with LPS had a total of 1,270 differentially expressed genes of which 787 were upregulated and 483 were downregulated. Differentially expressed genes included TNF-α, IL6, STAT1, and MAPK4. Overall, results showed that TTO (at least in vitro) has a protective effect against LPS-induced mastitis. Further in vivo research should be performed to determine strategies for using TTO for prevention and treatment of mastitis and improvement of milk quality."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Demodex blepharitis is a chronic condition commonly associated with recalcitrant dry eye symptoms though many people with Demodex mites are asymptomatic. The primary cause of this condition in humans is two types of Demodex mites: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. There are varying reports of the prevalence of Demodex blepharitis among adults, and it affects both men and women equally. While Demodex mites are commonly treated with tea tree oil, the effectiveness of tea tree oil for treating Demodex blepharitis is not well documented. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of tea tree oil on ocular Demodex infestation in people with Demodex blepharitis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the databases on 18 June 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with tea tree oil (or its components) versus another treatment or no treatment for people with Demodex blepharitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts and then full text of records to determine their eligibility. The review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Covidence. A third review author resolved any conflicts at all stages. MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs (1124 eyes of 562 participants; 17 to 281 participants per study) from the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. The RCTs compared some formulation of tea tree oil to another treatment or no treatment. Included participants were both men and women, ranging from 39 to 55 years of age. All RCTs were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. We also identified two RCTs that are ongoing or awaiting publications. Data from three RCTs that reported a short-term mean change in the number of Demodex mites per eight eyelashes contributed to a meta-analysis. We are uncertain about the mean reduction for the groups that received the tea tree oil intervention (mean difference [MD] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24 to 1.16) at four to six weeks as compared to other interventions. Only one RCT reported data for long-term changes, which found that the group that received intense pulse light as the treatment had complete eradication of Demodex mites at three months. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. Three RCTs reported no evidence of a difference for participant reported symptoms measured on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) between the tea tree oil group and the group receiving other forms of intervention. Mean differences in these studies ranged from -10.54 (95% CI - 24.19, 3.11) to 3.40 (95% CI -0.70 7.50). We did not conduct a meta-analysis for this outcome given substantial statistical heterogeneity and graded the certainty of the evidence as low. One RCT provided information concerning visual acuity but did not provide sufficient data for between-group comparisons. The authors noted that mean habitual LogMAR visual acuity for all study participants improved post-treatment (mean LogMAR 1.16, standard deviation 0.26 at 4 weeks). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as low. No RCTs provided data on mean change in number of cylindrical dandruff or the proportion of participants experiencing conjunctival injection or experiencing meibomian gland dysfunction. Three RCTs provided information on adverse events. One reported no adverse events. The other two described a total of six participants randomized to treatment with tea tree oil who experienced ocular irritation or discomfort that resolved with re-educating the patient on application techniques and continuing use of the tea tree oil. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current review suggests that there is uncertainty related to the effectiveness of 5% to 50% tea tree oil for the short-term treatment of Demodex blepharitis; however, if used, lower concentrations may be preferable in the eye care arena to avoid induced ocular irritation. Future studies should be better controlled, assess outcomes at long term (e.g. 10 to 12 weeks or beyond), account for patient compliance, and study the effects of different tea tree oil concentrations.",

The increase in its incidence has been associated with resistance to antimicrobial therapy and biofilm formation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of tea tree oil (TTO) and its main component - terpinen-4-ol - against resistant Candida albicans strains (genotypes A and B) identified by molecular typing and against C. albicans ATCC 90028 and SC 5314 reference strains in planktonic and biofilm cultures. The minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, and rate of biofilm development were used to evaluate antifungal activity. Results were obtained from analysis of the biofilm using the cell proliferation assay 2,3-Bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Terpinen-4-ol and TTO inhibited C. albicans growth. CLSM confirmed that 17.92 mg/mL of TTO and 8.86 mg/mL of terpinen-4-ol applied for 60 s (rinse simulation) interfered with biofilm formation. Hence, this in vitro study revealed that natural substances such as TTO and terpinen-4-ol present promising results for the treatment of oral candidiasis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tea tree oil (TTO) plays an important role in antibacterial activity and alleviating the inflammatory responses. Bovine mammary epithelium and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) can actively respond to bovine mastitis infection. However, regulatory effects of TTO extracts on the innate immune response of bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) and PMNL remain not reported. Therefore, aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of TTO extracts on the mRNA levels of the genes involved in the innate immune response of BMECs and PMNL. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that addition of 0.025% and 0.05% TTO increased the proliferation of BMECs, and significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) the viability of BMECs exposed to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). An inhibitory effect was observed against the growth of S. aureus by TTO incubation. The 0.05% TTO reduced S. aureus biofilm formation, association and invasion of S. aureus to BMECs, and changed the morphological and structural features of S. aureus. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were decreased (P < 0.001) by the incubation of TTO. Interestingly, the expression of IL-8 known for PMNL chemotactic function was elevated (P < 0.05) by 0.05% TTO treatment. Consistently, 0.05% TTO increased the migration of PMNL in S. aureus-exposed BMECs when compared with S. aureus treatment alone (P < 0.05). In addition, PMNL incubated with 0.05% TTO decreased the levels of NFKB inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA) and TNF-α. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that use of TTO can relieve the BMECs pro-inflammatory response caused by S. aureus and promote the migration of PMNL to mount the innate immune responses, and it may be novel strategy for the treatment of bovine mastitis caused by S. aureus."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to reveal the effects and possible mechanism of terpinen-4-ol, the main component of tea tree oil (TTO), on the disease resistance of strawberry fruit. When the effects of TTO and its components were compared on the decay development in fruit inoculated with Botrytis cinerea after treatment, strawberry treated with terpinen-4-ol showed the lowest disease incidence (44.4%) after 48 h and also the smallest lesion diameter during the whole storage. This indicates that terpinen-4-ol induces the highest disease resistance in strawberry compared with TTO and other components. Untargeted metabolomic analysis showed that terpinen-4-ol treatment strongly activated phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid metabolism pathway by increasing the accumulation of cinnamaldehyde, coniferyl aldehyde, naringenin, taxifolin, quercetin, and quercitrin in fruit at 12 h after treatment. In addition, terpinen-4-ol treatment also caused the accumulation of total phenolics and lignin by enhancing activities and relative gene expression of key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway. These results suggest that terpinen-4-ol, as the key component of TTO, is the most important contributor to the effectiveness of TTO in improving disease resistance of strawberry fruit through activating the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The tea tree oil was administered in the form of mouthwash and then compared with a mouthwash with chlorhexidine 0.12%. Both treatments were domestic and lasted for 14 days. Patients were chosen according to random criteria, aged between 18 and 60 years, and who showed a clinically evident gingivitis. In clinical evaluation, the following clinical criteria were taken into consideration: gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), bleeding index (BI), probing depth (PD), the presence of dental dyschromia, and the presence of taste alteration. The subjects were evaluated before (T0) and after the treatment (T1), and the data collected for each patient were recorded on a periodontal chart. RESULTS:  The comparison showed that tea tree oil offered a better improvement in the evaluation of PI, BOP, and PD; furthermore, it did not cause dental dyschromia and taste alteration. In group A, treated with tea tree oil, PI decreased from 53.25 to 5.50% and BI from 38.41 to 4.22%. In group B, treated with chlorhexidine PI decreased from 47.69 to 2.37% and BI from 32.93 to 6.28%. Instead, the subjects using chlorhexidine 0.12% blamed a distaste for the product that caused a slight taste alteration; 20% of them showed iatrogenic dental dyschromia. CONCLUSIONS:  The collected data showed the efficacy of both treatments. Although further research works will be necessary, this study showed that tea tree oil could be an effective nontoxic substitute for the therapy of gingivitis."

Traditionally, Tioconazole is used as a topical antifungal for curing PV. Previous investigations cited that human amniotic membrane (HAM), a placental tissue, has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities and is useful as a dressing for healing skin lesions. Moreover, tea tree oil (TTO) has a potent antifungal efficacy. This clinical trial aims to achieve an alternative therapeutic treatment able to kill Malassezia and heal PV lesions using TTO-saturated HAM (TOSHAM), with little application times. This study subjected 120 patients with hypopigmented or hyperpigmented PV lesions; half patients were treated weekly with TOSHAM compared with the others who applying 1% Tioconazole cream daily as a traditional treatment. Microbiological evaluation of in vitro fungicidal activity of TOSHAM versus Tioconazole was carried out against Malassezia furfur culture. The clinical outcomes of this study proved the superior activity of TOSHAM to heal PV lesions than Tioconazole; this was in harmony with microbiological findings. This study approached a novel therapeutic treatment of PV with great outcomes by using TOSHAM.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phytotherapy is becoming a more and more common practice, not only for personal care but also for pet care. Nevertheless, we often have to deal with substances on which, in most cases, very little literature is available, even more so if the species of interest are the exotic ones. In particular, the essential oil from the Melaleuca leaves, because of its antinflammatory and antibacterial properties, is widely used and very little is known about its potential toxicity on pet birds. The present paper describes the first case of Tea tree oil intoxication in a pet bird. CASE PRESENTATION: A one-year-old, 80 g male cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) was presented for clinical examination due to a serious despondency episode after the application of 3 drops of tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifoglia) directly on the cutis of its right wing. The subject was urgently hospitalized and blood tests were performed.Serum biochemical values showed severe liver damage and slight renal involvement, complete blood count (CBC) parameters indicated a moderate neutrophilia a moderate neutropenia. Warm subcutaneous fluids and vitamin (VIT) B12 were administered, and after 8 h of fluid therapy the clinical condition of the patient improved. The subject was discharged after 48 h of hospitalization, in stable conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Toxicosis are relatively common in bird pets and a number of cases are reported in literature, concerning heavy metals intoxications and toxic plants ingestion. However, in literature there are no described cases regarding Melaleuca oil intoxication in pet birds, but it has been reported in humans (mainly by ingestion) as well as in dogs, cats and rats. We hope that this first case report can be an initial aid in the knowledge of this potential toxicosis and therefore in the clinical veterinary practice of pet birds.",

AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safty of permethrin 2.5% in combination with tea tree oil (TTO) topical gel versus placebo on Demodex density (Dd) and clinical manifestation using standard skin surface biopsy (SSSB) in rosacea patients. PATIENT/METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 47 papulopustular rosacea patients were enrolled, with 35 patients finishing the 12 weeks of treatment. Each patient used permethrin 2.5% with TTO on one side of the face and a placebo on the other, twice daily for 12 weeks. SSSB, photography and clinical rosacea scores according to National Rosacea Society, as well as adverse drug reaction (ADRs) were reported at the baseline, 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 12th weeks. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were enrolled with papulopustular rosacea, and 35 patients finished the study. The effects of permethrin 2.5% with TTO gel on mite density were significant at week 5, 8, 12 (P value = .001). Clinical features and global assessments showed papules, pustules and nontransient erythema had improvement in drug group after 12 weeks (P values <.05). The improvement of burning and stinging and dry appearance was greater than the placebo gel (P value <.05). Itching in placebo group was significantly more than other group (P value = .002). CONCLUSION: Administration of permethrin 2.5% with TTO gel demonstrated good efficacy and safety in rosacea. This topical gel inhibited the inflammatory effects of rosacea and reduced Demodex mite.",

It results from cutaneous infection by the actinobacterium Dermatophilus congolensis. For economic reasons, the ailment is often treated with commercially available over-the-counter (OTC) products or home remedies rather than prescribed medications. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of tea tree oil (TTO), an essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia, as an OTC treatment for streptothricosis. Bacteria were isolated from presumptive streptothricosis lesions on horses at a farm in Forest, Virginia. These isolates were microbiologically and genetically confirmed to be D. congolensis. The antimicrobial activity of TTO against D. congolensis isolates was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration and disc diffusion assays and compared with three OTC products advertised specifically for the treatment of \"rain rot,\" a colloquial term for streptothricosis. A 1% TTO solution (v/v, in baby oil) and the three selected OTC products were applied to equine streptothricosis lesions to evaluate in vivo resolution of the lesions. Tea tree oil exhibited antimicrobial behavior against D. congolensis in vitro and produced marked improvement of streptothricosis lesions in vivo. These results have implications for development of TTO as a possible treatment for streptothricosis.",

METHODS: This prospective triple-blinded randomized clinical trial was performed on 62 eyes of 62 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups-(1) treatment group: for 33 patients in the treatment group, artificial tears, topical steroid drops, and eye shampoos with tea tree oil and (2) for 29 patients in the control group, artificial tears, topical steroids, and eye shampoos without tea tree oil were used. In the first and second (after 1 month) follow-up visits, microscopic Demodex examination, refraction, corrected distance visual acuity, the ocular surface disease index score (by the questionnaire), Schirmer test, tear break-up time test, and osmolarity of tears (by TearLab) were recorded in treatment and control groups. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 66.37 ± 8.83 (range: 37-82) years, of which 49 (79%) were female and 13 (21%) were male. The results showed a significant improvement in tear break-up time test, corrected distance visual acuity, osmolarity, and ocular surface disease index score in both groups (p < 0.05). However, the number of Demodex decreases significantly only in the treatment group after treatment (p <0.001). Tear break-up time, osmolarity, and ocular surface disease index scores in the treatment group were significantly better than the control group (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the pre- and post-Schirmer test results (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Eyelid scrubbing with eye shampoo containing tea tree oil is recommended for dry eye treatment after cataract surgery, especially decrease in the number of Demodex.",

This oil has traditionally been used for the treatment of various skin infections. The present study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effects of TTO against two representative types of human skin cancer, namely malignant melanoma (A-375) and squamous cell carcinoma (HEp-2).To outline the basic molecular mechanism involved in apoptosis induction in A-375 and HEp-2 cell lines, Annexin V/PI staining for apoptosis detection, cell cycle analysis were monitored using flow cytometry and mRNA expression levels of the apoptosis-regulatory genes P53, BAX, and BCL-2 were determined by real-time PCR and western blot after treatment with TTO. Results showed that TTO exhibited a strong cytotoxicity towards A-375 and HEp-2 cell lines, with IC50 values of 0.038% (v/v) and 0.024% (v/v) respectively. This cytotoxicity resulted from TTO induced apoptosis in both A-375 and HEp-2 cell lines as evidenced by morphological features of apoptosis and Annexin V/PI staining results in addition to the activation of caspase-3/7 and -9, upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes (P53 and BAX) and downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2. Additionally, cell cycle analysis showed that TTO caused cell cycle arrest mainly at G2/M phase. Taken together, the results of this study reveal that TTO is an effective apoptosis inducer in A-375 and HEp-2 cancer cell lines, indicating that it could be a promising chemopreventive candidate to be used in topical formulations against melanoma and squamous cell cancers; however, further in vivo studies may be warranted."

Many plants are known to have innate antimicrobial action and can be used as alternatives to antibiotics; thus, it is necessary to prove their effectiveness in vivo. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-acne efficacy of a new cream based on three natural extracts, comparing it to erythromycin cream and placebo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were randomly divided into three groups: treated with cream containing 20% propolis, 3% \"tea tree oil\", and 10% \"Aloe vera\" (PTAC) (n=20); or with 3 % erythromycin cream (ERC) (n=20); or with placebo (n=20). At baseline, after 15 and 30 days, investigators evaluated response to treatment by counting acne lesions through noninvasive measurements and macrophotography. RESULTS: All the clinical and instrumental values studied were statistically different from placebo except for sebometry, pHmetry, and erythema index values, measured on healthy skin. Unlike in the placebo group, papular and scar lesions showed high erythema reduction after 15 and 30 days of PTAC and ERC application. CONCLUSION: The PTAC formulation was better than ERC in reducing erythema scars, acne severity index, and total lesion count."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the in vitro antiparasitic effects of MGO™ Manuka honey and tea tree oil against ocular Demodex. METHODS: Fifty-two viable Demodex mites were acquired from the epilated eyelashes of 9 participants with blepharitis and symptomatic dry eye. Viable mites were randomised to one of five treatment groups: cyclodextrin-complexed and uncomplexed Manuka Honey, 100% and 50% tea tree oil, and no treatment. Following treatment application, mite viability was assessed for 240 min, based on limb and body movement and/or the development of a crenated/translucent appearance. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was then performed. RESULTS: The log-rank test demonstrated a significant treatment effect on the survival distribution of Demodex mites (p < 0.001). Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc pairwise analysis showed that all treatments except for uncomplexed honey effected lower survival probabilities than the untreated group (all p < 0.001). Among the four treatments, survival probabilities were lowest with 100% tea tree oil (all p < 0.001), and highest with uncomplexed honey (all p ≤ 0.001). No difference was observed between complexed honey and 50% tea tree oil (p = 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro efficacy of cyclodextrin-complexed Manuka honey was comparable with 50% tea tree oil, an established treatment for ocular Demodex. The findings support future clinical trials investigating the therapeutic effects of complexed honey in demodectic blepharitis patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In remote Aboriginal communities in Australia, scabies affects 7 out of 10 children before their first birthday. This is more than six times the rate seen in the rest of the developed world. Scabies infestation is frequently complicated by bacterial infection, leading to the development of skin sores and other more serious consequences, such as septicaemia and chronic heart and kidney diseases. Tea tree oil (TTO) has been used as an antimicrobial agent for several decades with proven clinical efficacy. Preclinical investigations have demonstrated superior scabicidal properties of TTO compared with widely used scabicidal agents, such as permethrin 5% cream and ivermectin. However, current data are insufficient to warrant a broad recommendation for its use for the management of scabies because previous studies were small or limited to in vitro observations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A pragmatic first trial will examine the clinical efficacy of a simple and low-cost TTO treatment against paediatric scabies and the prevention of associated secondary bacterial infections, with 1:1 randomisation of 200 participants (Aboriginal children, aged 5-16 years and living in remote Australia) into active control (permethrin 5% cream) and treatment (5% TTO gel) groups. The primary outcome for the study is clinical cure (complete resolution). Secondary outcome measures will include relief of symptoms, recurrence rate, adverse effects, adherence to treatment regimen and patient acceptability. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project has received approvals from the University of Canberra Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 16-133), Wurli-Wurlinjang Health Service Indigenous subcommittee and the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory reference group. The results of this study will be published in core scientific publications, with extensive knowledge exchange activities with non-academic audiences throughout the duration of the project.

Effect of type and concentration of surfactants was studied on size of 0.1% adapalene loaded nano-emulsion. Optimized formulation was then evaluated for particle size, polydispersity index, morphology, viscosity, and pH. Subsequently, 1% carbopol® 934 was incorporated to the optimized formulation for preparation of its gel form. The efficacy and safety of 0.1% adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel was assessed compared to marketed gel containing 0.1% adapalene. In-vitro studies showed that adapalene permeation through the skin was negligible in both adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel and adapalene marketed gel. Furthermore, drug distribution studies in skin indicated higher retention of adapalene in the dermis in adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel compared with adapalene marketed gel. Antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes showed that adapalene loaded nano-emulsion is effective in reducing minimum inhibitory concentration of the formulation in comparison with tea tree oil nano-emulsion, and pure tea tree oil. In vivo skin irritation studies showed absence of irritancy for adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel. Also, blood and liver absorption of the drug, histological analysis of liver and liver enzyme activity of rats after 90 days' treatment were investigated. No drug was detected in blood/liver which in addition to an absence of any adverse effect on liver and enzymes showed the potential of adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel as a novel carrier for topical delivery of adapalene.",

This review summarizes the topical treatments of TTO and T4O in human demodicosis, their possible mechanism of actions, side-effects and potential resistance in treating this condition.

We evaluated the therapeutic effect of eyelids scrubbing with TTO in a group of patients with lid margin disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients were recruited. Half of them received lid scrubbing with a TTO formula (Naviblef™) and the other half was treated by massage and cleansing. The effect on ocular surface symptoms, tear film stability, and lid signs was evaluated. RESULTS: All patients receiving TTO improved in symptoms, signs, and tear film stability, and the improvement was statistically significant at P < 0.001. Only five patients in massage group showed improvement. The changes in massage group were not statistically significant at P < 0.001. TTO is very effective in relieving symptoms and improving tear film stability and lid signs."

As antibacterial agent, the inclusion complex was encapsulated into PEO matrix by electrospun. After plasma treatment, the release efficiency of antibacterial agent from PEO nanofibers was improved. As a result, the antibacterial activity of PEO nanofibers was enhanced accordingly. The plasma-treated nanofiber membranes achieved the highest antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, which was tested on the beef for 7d, with inhibition efficiently of 99.99% whether at 4°C or 12°C.

Previously, we demonstrated that TTO has a strong inhibitory effect on Botrytis cinerea. This study investigates the underlying antifungal mechanisms at the molecular level. A proteomics approach using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was adopted to investigate the effects of TTO on B. cinerea. A total of 718 differentially expression proteins (DEPs) were identified in TTO-treated samples, 17 were markedly up-regulated and 701 were significantly down-regulated. Among the 718 DEPs, 562 were annotated and classified into 30 functional groups by GO (gene ontology) analysis. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis linked 562 DEPs to 133 different biochemical pathways, involving glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), and purine metabolism. Additional experiments indicated that TTO destroys cell membranes and decreases the activities of three enzymes related to the TCA cycle. Our results suggest that TTO treatment inhibits glycolysis, disrupts the TCA cycle, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby disrupting energy metabolism. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the antifungal activity of essential oils."

The use of phytotherapy is trending and many natural products have shown anti-microbial properties which can be used as cavity disinfectant in the field of dentistry. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of herbal antibacterial agents (Tea Tree Oil (TTO) and Aloe vera) with commercially available 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) as cavity disinfectant for use in minimally invasive dentistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included three test groups, Group I (2% chlorhexidine), Group II (tea tree oil), Group III (Aloe vera gel) with a control group (distilled water). Ten patients with atleast one tooth with an occlusal or occluso-proximal lesion suitable for Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) were selected for each group, dentinal samples were collected using sterile spoon excavators at three stages from each tooth viz., pre-excavation, post-excavation and post-disinfection of the cavities. These dentinal samples were subjected to microbiological analysis for Total Viable Count (TVC). The data collected were statistically analysed using ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test. RESULTS: The results of present study showed that there was a statistically significant reduction in TVC when compared between pre and post excavation in all the groups (p<0.05) and post- excavation and post-disinfection in all the test groups (p<0.05) (except control group). Post-disinfection, 2% chlorhexidine showed highest reduction in TVC followed by 1% tea tree oil and aloe vera gel. CONCLUSION: Natural antibacterial agents like tea tree oil and aloe vera could be effectively used as cavity disinfectants which will help in minimizing secondary caries and rendering a long term restorative success."

Tea tree oil (TTO) is a potent antimicrobial natural product, which is formulated in dry powder inhalers (DPIs) for the treatment of fungal and bacterial pneumonia. METHODS: Tea tree oil-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes (TTO-β-CD) were prepared and characterized. Aerodynamic properties of TTO-β-CD powders were measured. The rat models of fungal (Candida albicans) and bacterial (Acinetobacter baumannii) pneumonia were prepared. Saline, TTO, TTO-β-CD and the positive drug (fluconazole or penicillin) were directly delivered to the rat lungs. Pathological and biological assays were conducted. KEY FINDINGS: Tea tree oil-β-CD powders had an appropriate aerodynamic diameter of 5.59 μm and the fine particle fraction of 51.22%, suitable for pulmonary delivery. TTO-β-CD showed higher and similar antipneumonic effects on the rat models than fluconazole and penicillin, respectively. The effects of TTO-β-CD were higher than TTO alone. The antipneumonic mechanisms involved blocking the recruitment of leucocytes and neutrophils, eliminating the microbes, downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (including tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6), suppressing cyclooxygenase 2 expression, and further reducing lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled TTO-β-CD powders have the advantages of portability, high stability, self-administration, high lung deposition and good antipneumonic effect. It is a promising DPI for the treatment of fungal and bacterial pneumonia.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot study, randomized 4 × 4, controlled, cross-over, double-blind. 16 subjects with gingivitis (7 males and 9 females) aged 21-37 years, were randomly divided into four groups based on mouthwash that had to be used for domiciliary oral hygiene: mouthwash with essential oils, mouthwash with chlorhexidine 0,12 %, mouthwash containig tea tree oil and mouthwash placebo. Clinical evaluation was performed by: Full Mouth Plaque Score (FMPS), Full Mouth Bleeding Score (FMBS), Gingival Index (GI), discolorations, language examination and alteration of taste. The data were recorded before and 2 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Statistical analysis shows that treatments with tea tree oil, essential oils and chlorhexidine are effective. Comparing treatments should be noted that the tea tree oil gives a greater improvement in the GI and FMBS, while it is the least effective in the control of bacterial plaque. CONCLUSION: Although further studies are needed, the anti-inflammatory properties of the mouthwash made from TTO would seem to be a valuable non-toxic adjunct in the management of gingivitis."

      "abstract": "Tea tree oil (TTO), a volatile essential oil, has been widely used as an antimicrobial agent. However, the mechanism underlying TTO antifungal activity is not fully understood. In this study, a comprehensive metabolomics survey was undertaken to identify changes in metabolite production in Botrytis cinerea cells treated with TTO. Significant differences in 91 metabolites were observed, including 8 upregulated and 83 downregulated metabolites in TTO-treated cells. The results indicate that TTO inhibits primary metabolic pathways through the suppression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid metabolism. Further experiments show that TTO treatment decreases the activities of key enzymes in the TCA cycle and increases the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Membrane damage is also induced by TTO treatment. We hypothesize that the effect of TTO on B. cinerea is achieved mainly by disruption of the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the antifungal activities and possible mechanisms of tea tree oil (TTO) against Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum in vitro and in vivo. The results show that TTO exhibits dose-dependent antifungal activity against both pathogens, but P. expansum is less sensitive than B. cinerea to TTO not only in the in vitro test but also in artificially inoculated cherry fruits. TTO vapor treatment reduced the decay caused by these pathogens in inoculated cherry fruits, but the effect on P. expansum was less than that on B. cinerea. While the total lipid and ergosterol contents of the cell membrane are greater in P. expansum than in B. cinerea, TTO treatment lowers the total lipid content in the membranes of both species by well over 50%, and ergosterol content is reduced to a greater extent in B. cinerea than in P. expansum. In both pathogens, TTO alters mycelial morphology and cellular ultrastructure. Oxygen consumption measurements show that TTO inhibits respiratory metabolism via the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway in both pathogens, though more severely in B. cinerea than in P. expansum. The relatively decreased sensitivity of P. expansum to TTO may be due to the fact that TTO causes less disruption of the cell membrane in this organism, and higher inhibition the respiratory metabolism to the extent observed in B. cinerea.",

The difficulties associated with therapy have led to attempts at finding alternative treatment methods. Particularly popular is searching for cures among drugs made of plants. However, no substances with total efficacy in treating Acanthamoeba keratitis have been identified.Results of our semi in vivo studies of tea tree oil simulating eyeball infection demonstrated 100% effectiveness in the case of both trophozoites and cysts of amoebae from the genus Acanthamoeba. The action of tea tree oil indicates that this is the first substance with a potential ability to quickly and effectively remove the amoebae from the eye. Tea tree oil has the ability to penetrate tissues, which allows it to destroy amoebae in both the shallow and deep layers of the cornea. The present research into the use of tea tree oil in the therapy of Acanthamoeba infection is the first study of this type in parasitology. It offers tremendous potential for effective treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis and other diseases caused by these protozoa.",

In this study, the effects of tea tree oil (TTO) at subinhibitory concentrations on L. monocytogenes growth and two important exotoxin proteins secreted by L. monocytogenes were researched. Treatment with half of minimal inhibitory concentration of TTO demonstrated very little or no reduction in numbers of viable ATCC 19115 cells. Listeriolysin O (LLO) and p60, were investigated. A listeriolysin assay was used to investigate the hemolytic activities of L. monocytogenes exposed to TTO, and the secretion of LLO and p60 was detected by immunoblot analysis. Additionally, real-time RT-PCR was used to analyse the influence of TTO on the transcription of LLO and p60 encoded genes hly and iap respectively. According to our experimental results, we propose that TTO could be used as a promising natural compound against L. monocytogenes and its virulence factors. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report on the influence of subinhibitory concentrations of tea tree oil (TTO) on the secretion of listeriolysin O (LLO) and p60, the critical virulence factors involved in Listeria pathogenesis. The results showed that TTO at 0·25 mg ml-1 reduced the secretion of LLO and p60 to 10 and 34·9% respectively, in addtion, the transcription of hly and iap was reduced to 10 and 4·3% at 0·5 mg ml-1 respectively. We propose that TTO could be used as a promising antimicrobial compound and virulence inhibitor against L. monocytogenes.",

For this purpose, the in vivo studies used 15 cows distributed in three different groups with the same number of animals. Five cows remained untreated (Group A), representing the control group; other five cows were sprayed with TTO (at 5%) in its pure form (Group B); and five cows were sprayed with nanocapsules of TTO (at 0.75%) (Group C). On days 1 and 4 post-treatments (PT), all cows had their ticks counted. On day 1 PT, two ticks from each cow were collected to evaluate the effect of the treatment on ticḱs reproduction (in vitro assays). The pure form of TTO caused a significant reduction (P<0.05) in the number of ticks from the Group B compared to the Group A on day 4 PT. However, there was no significant difference in the number of ticks on cows from Groups A and C after treatment (P>0.05). Treatment with TTO in nanocapsules (Group C) interfered with R. microplus reproduction, leading to lower oviposition by female ticks and hatchability (34.5% of efficacy). On the other hand, TTO oil (Group B) did not interfere on ticḱs reproduction, i.e. showed higher hatchability than the control group. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that pure TTO has an acaricidal effect in dairy cows, in addition to an effect on ticḱs reproduction when used its nanocapsulated form.",

The presence of infection at the wound site can potentially stall the healing process at the inflammatory stage, leading to the development of a chronic wound. Traditional wound treatment regimes can no longer cope with the complications posed by antibiotic-resistant strains; hence, there is a need to explore the use of alternative antimicrobial agents. Pre-antibiotic compounds, including heavy metal ions and essential oils, have been re-investigated for their potential use as effective antimicrobial agents. Essential oils have potent antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other beneficial therapeutic properties. Similarly, heavy metal ions have also been used as disinfecting agents because of their broad spectrum activities. Both of these alternative antimicrobials interact with many different intracellular components, thereby resulting in the disruption of vital cell functions and eventually cell death. This review will discuss the application of essential oils and heavy metal ions, particularly tea tree oil and silver ions, as alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of chronic, infected wounds.",

METHODS: In this open-label, uncontrolled phase II pilot study, participants applied tea tree oil products to the face twice daily for 12 weeks and were assessed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Efficacy was determined from total numbers of facial acne lesions and the investigator global assessment (IGA) score. Tolerability was evaluated by the frequency of adverse events and the mean tolerability score determined at each visit. Product acceptability was assessed via a questionnaire at the end of the study period. RESULTS: Altogether 18 participants were enrolled, of whom 14 completed the study. Mean total lesion counts were 23.7 at baseline, 17.2 at 4, 15.1 at 8 and 10.7 at 12 weeks. Total lesion counts differed significantly over time by repeated measures anova (P < 0.0001). The mean IGA score was 2.4 at baseline, 2.2 at 4, 2.0 at 8 and 1.9 at 12 weeks, which also differed significantly over time (P = 0.0094). No serious adverse events occurred and minor local tolerability events were limited to peeling, dryness and scaling, all of which resolved without intervention. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the use of the tea tree oil products significantly improved mild to moderate acne and that the products were well tolerated.",

In the developed world, outbreaks in health institutions and vulnerable communities result in a significant economic burden. A review of the literature demonstrates the emergence of resistance toward classical scabicidal treatments and the lack of effectiveness of currently available scabicides in reducing the inflammatory skin reactions and pyodermal progression that occurs in predisposed patient cohorts. Tea tree oil (TTO) has demonstrated promising acaricidal effects against scabies mites in vitro and has also been successfully used as an adjuvant topical medication for the treatment of crusted scabies, including cases that did not respond to standard treatments. Emerging acaricide resistance threatens the future usefulness of currently used gold standard treatments (oral ivermectin and topical permethrin) for scabies. The imminent development of new chemical entities is doubtful. The cumulative acaricidal, antibacterial, antipruritic, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing effects of TTO may have the potential to successfully reduce the burden of scabies infection and the associated bacterial complications. This review summarizes current knowledge on the use of TTO for the treatment of scabies. On the strength of existing data for TTO, larger scale, randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted.",

The aim of this work was to prepare and characterize hydrogels containing these nanocarriers, and to evaluate their in vivo efficacy in protecting skin damage induced by UVB and cutaneous wound healing. Hydrogels were prepared using Carbopol Ultrez and their physicochemical characteristics were evaluated: macroscopic analysis, pH, spreadability and rheological properties. The in vivo antiedematogenic effect was evaluated by ear thickness measurement after UVB-irradiation. In order to evaluate healing action of hydrogels, we investigated the regression of the cutaneous lesion in rats. Hydrogels showed homogeneous aspect and pH values between 5.6-5.8 and a non-Newtonian behavior. The presence of nanocapsules and nanoemulsions in hydrogels did not change their spreadability profile. The inclusion of tea tree oil in the nanocapsules and nanoemulsions allowed reducing the edema induced by UVB exposure. Hydrogel containing nanocapsules presented a higher reduction of the wound area compared to the hydrogel containing nanoemulsions and hydrogel containing allantoin. This study shows the feasibility of obtained dermatological formulations containing the tea tree oil associated in nanostructured systems.

In this study, we investigated the antifungal activity and mode of action of tea tree oil (TTO) and its components against B. cinerea. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of the components we tested in contact phase, terpinen-4-ol had the highest antifungal activity, followed by TTO, α-terpineol, terpinolene, then 1,8-cineole. As one of characteristic components of TTO, terpinen-4-ol treatment led to pronounced alterations in mycelial morphology, cellular ultrastructure, membrane permeability under scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and fluorescent microscope, and also reduced the ergosterol content of fungi. As another characteristic component, 1,8-cineole caused serious intracellular damage but only slightly affected B. cinerea otherwise. When terpinen-4-ol and 1,8-cineole were used together, the synergistic antifungal activity was significantly higher than either component by itself. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study confirmed that terpinen-4-ol and 1,8-cineole act mainly on the cell membranes and organelles of B. cinerea, respectively, and when combined are similar to TTO in antifungal activity due to their differences. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Understanding the mechanism of terpinen-4-ol and 1,8-cineole antifungal action to B. cinerea is helpful for investigation on their synergistic effect and explaining antifungal action modes of TTO.",
