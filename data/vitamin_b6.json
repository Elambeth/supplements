      "abstract": "Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammatory condition often linked to autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Despite its low incidence, ON can lead to severe, irreversible visual impairment. Emerging evidence suggests the gut microbiota (GM) may influence ON through complex immune and metabolic pathways, yet the mechanisms remain underexplored. This study employed a multi-omics Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess the causal relationships between GM taxa and ON. We analyzed data from extensive genetic and metabolic profiling, examining the causal effect between 473 GM taxa, 731 immune cells/traits, 1400 metabolites, vitamin B6, and ON. Our methodology involved two-sample MR analysis to establish causality and mediation analysis to explore the mechanisms between GM and ON and potential therapeutic strategies. We identified 27 GM taxa with a direct causal relationship to ON risk. Further analysis highlighted three GM taxa with particularly strong associations. Mediation analysis revealed specific metabolic and immune pathways through which these taxa exert their effects, including notable interactions with vitamin B6 metabolism, which appeared to mediate some of these relationships. We found that vitamin B6 could be a potential therapeutic method by acting on GM in ON. This study advances our understanding of the complex etiology of ON and highlights the potential of GM as a target for therapeutic strategies. The significant role of vitamin B6 suggests new avenues for prevention and treatment, emphasizing the need for further research into diet-based interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In China, sodium cantharidinate/vitamin B6 (SC/VB6) injection has been approved since 2002 for the treatment of lung cancer and primary liver cancer. In addition to these authorized indications, clinical application of SC/VB6 is also common in various other types of cancer. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding on this topic. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to consolidate evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of off-label use of SC/VB6 in oncology. METHODS: International databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus, as well as Chinese databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Wanfang, will be searched from the inception to 31 December 2024. Comparative studies that evaluated the add-on effect of SC/VB6 to conventional cancer treatments against the use of conventional treatments alone will be considered in the scope of this review. The primary outcomes are objective response rate and performance status. Secondary outcomes are disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). Depending on heterogeneity, data will be synthesized using either the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect or the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect model. Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the following variables: type of cancer, study design, SC/VB6 dosage, treatment duration, and combined therapies, provided that each subgroup contains at least two studies. Sensitivity analyses will be performed on efficacy outcomes. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) will be utilized to appraise the overall quality of evidence. DISCUSSION: This review will encompass both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies, thereby enabling us to synthesize and assess evidence across experimental and real-world observational settings. Our findings will contribute to a better understanding on the benefit-risk profile regarding the off-label use of SC/VB6 in oncology, guiding the trajectory of future research, and offering a robust scientific foundation to inform clinical and regulatory decision-making process.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug resistance poses a formidable challenge in managing acute manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes. This study investigates the efficacy of folate and vitamin B6 supplementation as an adjunct to sodium valproate in improving treatment responses for patients experiencing acute mania. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 43 patients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder presenting with acute manic episodes were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: one receiving folate (5 mg/day) plus vitamin B6 (80 mg/day), a second group receiving folate alone (5 mg/day), and a third group receiving placebo. Evaluations were conducted at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). RESULTS: All groups demonstrated significant clinical improvements after the treatment period; however, the trends in MMSE scores showed no significant differences (p = 0.068). Notably, the reduction in YMRS scores significantly varied across groups (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.342), with the folate group demonstrating a significantly greater decrease compared to both the folate/B6 (p = 0.003) and placebo groups (p < 0.001). Recovery rates revealed that 80% of patients receiving folate showed over a 50% decrease in YMRS scores after 3 weeks, markedly higher than the other groups (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the short-term use of folate as a beneficial adjunct in treating acute manic episodes in bipolar I disorder. However, the addition of vitamin B6 did not yield additional advantages. These results may inform future treatment guidelines targeting acute mania in bipolar disorder, advocating for folate supplementation as a potential strategy to enhance therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of vitamin B6 is involved in 4% of cellular enzymatic activities and its deficiency is responsible for or contributes to several human diseases. The study of underlying mechanisms is still in its infancy and requires suitable model organisms. In Drosophila the deficiency of vitamin B6 produces chromosome aberrations and hallmarks of human diseases including diabetes and cancer. However, the effects of vitamin B6 deficiency have never been examined at a metabolic level. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the metabolic changes in vitamin B6 deficient Drosophila larvae with the aim of validating flies as a suitable model for diseases associated to vitamin B6 deficiency. METHODS: To induce vitamin B6 deficiency we fed Drosophila wild type larvae with 4-deoxypyridoxine (4DP), a PLP antagonist. By HPLC analysis we verified that the 4DP treatment was effective in inducing vitamin B6 deficiency. Using an NMR-based metabolomic approach we compared the metabolites in larval extracts from untreated and 4DP-fed larvae. RESULTS: The NMR spectra analysis identified quantitative differences for sixteen metabolites out of forty, including branched chain and aromatic amino acids, glucose, and lipids, thus revealing interesting possible associations with the phenotypes showed by vitamin B6 deficient flies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results validate Drosophila as a suitable model to study in depth the molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases associated with vitamin B6 deficiency and confirmed that 4DP treatment is effective in inducing vitamin B6 deficiency.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance poses a severe threat to human health, with colistin serving as a critical medication in clinical trials against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However, the efficacy of colistin is increasingly compromised due to the rise of MCR-positive bacteria worldwide. Here, we reveal a notable metabolic disparity between mcr-positive and -negative bacteria through transcriptome and metabolomics analysis. Specifically, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, was significantly diminished in mcr-positive bacteria. Conversely, supplementing with PLP could reverse the metabolic profile of drug-resistant bacteria and effectively restore colistin's bactericidal properties. Mechanistically, PLP was found to augment bacterial proton motive force by inhibiting the Kdp transport system, a bacterial K+ transport ATPase, thereby facilitating the binding of the positively charged colistin to the negatively charged bacterial membrane components. Furthermore, PLP supplementation triggers ferroptosis-like death by accumulating ferrous ions and inducing lipid peroxidation. These two modes of action collectively resensitize mcr-harboring Gram-negative bacteria to colistin therapy. Altogether, our study provides a novel metabolic-driven antibiotic sensitization strategy to tackle antibiotic resistance and identifies a potentially safe antibiotic synergist.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a long-lasting side-effect of oxaliplatin. Vitamin B6 might play a role in the pathogenesis of CIPN. Therefore, we investigated associations between plasma vitamin B6 markers and the occurrence and severity of chronic CIPN in patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 242 patients with CRC receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were included. Blood samples were collected at diagnosis (ie, before chemotherapy), and 6 and 12 months after diagnosis (ie, during and after chemotherapy, respectively). Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxal (PL) and xanthurenic acid:3-hydroxykynurenine (XA:HK) ratio were measured as vitamin B6 markers using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Chronic CIPN was assessed 12 months after diagnosis using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-CIPN twenty-item scale questionnaire. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) were used to assess associations with chronic CIPN occurrence, and linear regressions were used to assess associations with chronic CIPN severity. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes and timing of chemotherapy (neoadjuvant/adjuvant/both). RESULTS: Chronic CIPN was found in 80% (n=194) of patients. Higher PLP levels and XA:HK ratios during chemotherapy were associated with lower occurrence of chronic CIPN (PRperdoubling 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91 and PRCS<0.05, respectively) and lower chronic CIPN severity (βperdoubling -4.54, 95% CI -7.12 to -1.96 and βperdoubling -6.30, 95% CI -9.53 to -3.07, respectively). No associations between PL levels and chronic CIPN were observed. CONCLUSION: Within this population, merely having PLP levels within the normal range, higher vitamin B6 status during chemotherapy was associated with lower occurrence and severity of chronic CIPN. Future research is warranted to investigate causality and the optimal vitamin B6 status during chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a harmful environmental contaminant known to disrupt gut microbiota and cause health problems. In recent years, the role of vitamin B6 (VB6) in maintaining intestinal and reproductive health has attracted much attention. AFB1 has been found to damage the intestinal barrier and cause inflammation by disrupting the intestinal microbiota, particularly by increasing the abundance of Enterococcus. In mice treated with AFB1, serum metabolites were disturbed, VB6 serum levels were reduced, and testicular inflammation was exacerbated. Enterococcus exposure in mice leads to a reduction in serum VB6 levels, which is accompanied by intestinal and testicular damage. However, VB6 supplementation significantly ameliorated AFB1-induced intestinal and testicular injury. Transcriptomics and Western blotting showed that after AFB1 exposure, VB6 could increase the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and kinase B (AKT) as well as their phosphorylated forms in the testes of mice. Based on the results, AFB1 leads to intestinal and testicular damage by disturbing the gut microbiota, and VB6 represents a potential therapeutic to counteract this damage. In conclusion, supplementation with adequate VB6 can ameliorate AFB1-induced intestinal and testicular damage, emphasizing the importance of VB6 intervention and providing a new perspective for the prevention and treatment of AFB1-related health issues.",

Research indicates that excessive intake of vitamin B6 can have implications on neurological function, underscoring the importance of cautious consideration when administering vitamin B6 treatment during early pregnancy. This systematic review investigates the effects of high doses of vitamin B6 on pregnant women experiencing NVP. We searched the PubMed® MEDLINE® database for articles using the following terms: \"pregnancy\" or \"nausea and vomiting during pregnancy\" and \"vitamin B6.\" Women with nausea and vomiting symptoms during pregnancy use more than the tolerable amount of vitamin B6. A total of 136 articles were identified from the PubMed® MEDLINE® database. The etiology and treatment of NVP are briefly outlined, followed by a summary and analysis of 19 relevant literature sources. Among these sources, 12 reports detailed the adverse effects of excessive vitamin B6 intake in women; 164/1226 individuals experienced neurological symptoms such as burning, tingling, paresthesia, ataxia, or perioral numbness. Additionally, out of 245 women, four experienced miscarriages and one had an intrauterine demise. The overconsumption of vitamin B6 has the potential to impact nerve function, particularly during the critical first trimester of embryonic development.

Though significant correlations between RA and micronutrients have been found in earlier observational studies, their underlying causal relationship is still unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the causal genetic relationships between 15 micronutrients (copper, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, E, D, B6, B12, folate, carotene, iron, selenium, calcium, potassium) and RA. METHOD: The exposure factors and outcome data used in the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) were derived from publicly available summary statistics data of European populations. The GWAS data for exposure factors were obtained from the OpenGWAS database. For the outcome data of RA, we utilized data from the FinnGen database. We used the MR principle to remove confounding factors and conducted MR analyses using five methods: inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode, with IVW as the primary method. Then, we identified micronutrients related to RA and performed MR analyses on these elements, including heterogeneity analysis and pleiotropy analysis such as MR-Egger intercept, MR-PRESSO method, and \"leave-one-out\" analysis. Finally, we conducted multivariable MR analyses and performed sensitivity analyses again. RESULTS: The IVW analysis revealed a relationship between vitamin B6 and RA (p: 0.029, OR: 1.766, and 95% CI: 1.062-2.938). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the validity and reliability of this result. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a causal relationship between vitamin B6 and RA, with vitamin B6 being identified as a risk factor for RA. This finding could contribute to the diagnosis and supplementary treatment of RA patients, providing a reference for subsequent basic research and developing new drugs."

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain cancer. The prognosis of GBM patients has marginally improved over the last three decades. The response of GBMs to initial treatment is inevitably followed by relapse. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify and develop new therapeutics to target this cancer and improve both patient outcomes and long-term survival. Metabolic reprogramming is considered one of the hallmarks of cancers. However, cell-based studies fail to accurately recapitulate the in vivo tumour microenvironment that influences metabolic signalling and rewiring. Against this backdrop, we conducted global, untargeted metabolomics analysis of the G7 and R24 GBM 2D monolayers and 3D spheroid cultures under identical cell culture conditions. Our studies revealed that the levels of multiple metabolites associated with the vitamin B6 pathway were significantly altered in 3D spheroids compared to the 2D monolayer cultures. Importantly, we show that pharmacological intervention with hydralazine, a small molecule that reduces vitamin B6 levels, resulted in the cell death of 3D GBM spheroid cultures. Thus, our study shows that inhibition of the vitamin B6 pathway is a novel therapeutic strategy for the development of targeted therapies in GBMs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), a natural polymer found in fermented soybean products, has been reported to play a prebiotic role in the gut. This intervention study investigated the effects of γ-PGA-containing supplement consumption on urinary microbiota in healthy adults because of limited data on such investigation. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A 4-week parallel trial including 39 male and female Korean adults, who were free of chronic diseases and infection, was designed as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. A total of 30 participants completed the study wherein the intervention group (n = 17) received a mixture supplement containing 600 mg/day of γ-PGA and 100 mg/day of vitamin B6, while the control group (n = 13) received a placebo. Paired datasets (baseline and endpoint data) of microbiota profiles, which were constructed via urinary assays of microbe-derived extracellular vesicles, were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Only the intervention group yielded significant results for the Bray-Curtis and Jaccard dissimilarity indices between baseline and endpoint data (P < 0.05). In the phylum-level analysis of microbial composition, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (FB ratio) tended to decrease from baseline in the intervention group; however, it increased in the control group. Differences between the baseline and endpoint FB ratios were significant between the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study's findings suggest that γ-PGA-vitamin B6 supplementation potentially alters the microbial community composition of a host. Further investigation into the biological consequences of commensal microbiota alteration by γ-PGA-containing supplement consumption is warranted."

      "abstract": "Marginal vitamin B6 (B6) deficiency is common in various segments worldwide. In a super-aged society, sarcopenia is a major concern and has gained significant research attention focused on healthy aging. To date, the primary interventions for sarcopenia have been physical exercise therapy. Recent evidence suggests that inadequate B6 status is associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia and mortality among older adults. Our previous study showed that B6 supplementation to a marginal B6-deficient diet up-regulated the expression of various exercise-induced genes in the skeletal muscle of rodents. Notably, a supplemental B6-to-B6-deficient diet stimulates satellite cell-mediated myogenesis in rodents, mirroring the effects of physical exercise. These findings suggest the potential role of B6 as an exercise-mimetic nutrient in skeletal muscle. To test this hypothesis, we reviewed relevant literature and compared the roles of B6 and exercise in muscles. Here, we provide several pieces of evidence supporting this hypothesis and discuss the potential mechanisms behind the similarities between the effects of B6 and exercise on muscle. This research, for the first time, provides insight into the exercise-mimetic roles of B6 in skeletal muscle.",

      "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) brings great challenges to the poultry industry. Vitamin B6 (VB6) is an essential micro-nutrient for animals to maintain normal physiological functions and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to explore the effect of VB6 on alleviating HS-induced intestinal barrier impairment in broilers. A total of 250 broilers (609.76 ± 0.34 g) were randomly allocated to 5 groups with 5 replicate cages of 10 birds each. The broilers in thermoneutral (TN) group were raised in thermoneutral conditions (23 ± 1°C) and fed with a basal diet. The birds in other four groups were housed under cycle high temperature (34 ± 1°C for 8 h/d) from d 21 to 35 and fed with the basal diet (HS group) or basal diet supplemented with 6, 12, or 24 mg/kg VB6 (HB-6, HB-12, HB-24 groups). The results showed that HS reduced the growth performance, increased ileum inflammatory cytokines levels, and impaired the gut barrier function (P < 0.05). Compared to the HS group, final body weight, average daily gain, and average daily feed intake, and the feed conversion ratio were improved by VB6 supplementation. The diamine oxidase, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-18, IL-10, and interferon-γ levels were reduced by VB6 supplementation (P < 0.05). Moreover, VB6 supplementation linearly or quadratically enhanced villus height and villus height-to-crypt depth ratio of duodenum and jejunum, and decreased crypt depth of duodenum and ileum. The mRNA expression of Occlaudin, ZO1, Mucin2, Mucin4, E-cadhein, and β-catenin were increased by VB6 treatment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, dietary VB6 altered the diversity and community of gut microbiota (P < 0.05). A total of 83 differential metabolites associated with the amelioration of VB6 were identified, which were primarily enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, caffeine metabolism, and glutathione metabolism pathway. Collectively, VB6 may improve the growth performance and intestinal barrier function of heat-stressed broilers by regulating the ileal microbiota and metabolic homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Chickpeas are more sustainable than other food systems and have high a nutritional value, especially regarding their vitamin composition. One of the main vitamins in chickpeas is vitamin B6, which is very important for several human metabolic functions. Since chickpeas are consumed after cooking, our goal was to better understand the role of leaching (diffusion) and thermal degradation of vitamin B6 in chickpeas during hydrothermal processing. Kinetics were conducted at four temperatures, ranging from 25 to 85 °C, carried out for 4 h in an excess of water for the diffusion kinetics, or in hermetic bags for the thermal degradation kinetics. Thermal degradation was modeled according to a first-order reaction, and diffusion was modeled according to a modified version of Fick's second law. Diffusivity constants varied from 4.76 × 10-14 m2/s at 25 °C to 2.07 × 10-10 m2/s at 85 °C; the temperature had an impact on both the diffusivity constant and the residual vitamin B6. The kinetic constant ranged from 9.35 × 10-6 at 25 °C to 54.9 × 10-6 s-1 at 85 °C, with a lower impact of the temperature. In conclusion, vitamin B6 is relatively stable to heat degradation; loss is mainly due to diffusion, especially during shorter treatment times."

Eighteen pseudopregnant bitches were treated for 20 days in groups receiving placebo (n = 6); cabergoline (5 μg/kg/day; n = 6); or vitamin B6 (50 mg/kg/day; n = 6). Blood was collected on the 1st day of drug administration and 120 h later to measure serum prolactin (PRL). After treatment, they were ovariohysterectomized and uterine fragments were collected for histomorphometry and immunohistochemical evaluation of PR, ERα, AR, TRα, Kiss1 and Kiss1r. After 120 h of cabergoline or vitamin B6 treatment, PRL levels were reduced in the bitches, confirming the antiprolactinemic effect of these drugs. Furthermore, regardless of treatment, the animals exhibited uterine histomorphometry consistent with dioestrus. The PR showed strong immunostaining in all regions and an increase in scores was observed for this receptor in animals treated with vitamin B6 in deep glands. In contrast, ERα and Kiss1R receptors showed weak to no immunostaining in all uterine regions and no changes between groups. Regarding AR, most animals treated with vitamin B6 showed increased trends in the deep gland and myometrium marking scores. In contrast, in both vitamin B6 and cabergoline treatments, a reduction in TRα marking scores was observed compared to the control group. In addition, on the endometrial surface, a reduction was observed in the marked area of Kiss1 after administration of cabergoline when compared to the pseudopregnant control group. These findings shed valuable insight into the use of vitamin B6 as a drug with actions similar to cabergoline in reducing PRL and uterine modulation in bitches.",

This study aims to examine the effects of vitamin B6, a component that has been reported to be capable of alleviating inflammation and cell death in various diseases, on cartilage degeneration in OA. METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model were established and the severity of OA in cartilage was determined using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system. The mRNA and protein levels of indicators associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism, apoptosis and inflammation were detected. The effect of vitamin B6 (VB6) on the mice were assessed using HE staining and masson staining. The apoptosis rate of cells was assessed using TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. RESULTS: Our results showed a trend of improved OARSI score in mice treated with VB6, which remarkably inhibited the hyaline cartilage thickness, chondrocyte disordering, and knees hypertrophy. Moreover, the VB6 supplementation reduced the protein expression of pro-apoptosis indicators, including Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and raised the expression level of anti-apoptosis marker Bcl-2. Importantly, VB6 improved ECM metabolism in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that VB6 alleviates OA through regulating ECM metabolism, inflammation and apoptosis in chondrocytes and CIA mice. The findings in this study provide a theoretical basis for targeted therapy of OA, and further lay the theoretical foundation for studies of mechanisms of VB6 in treating OA.",

Vitamin B6 (VB6) is a vital nutrient that plays a significant role in preserving human health and has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. METHODS: This study aimed to explore the potential pancreatic protective effects of VB6 in mitigating pancreatic inflammation and apoptosis induced by taurocholate sodium (TLCS) in an AP model and to assess the underlying mechanism of action. AP was induced in Sprague‒Dawley (SD) rats through TLCS administration and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated AR42J cells, followed by treatment with VB6. RESULTS: Various parameters associated with AP were assessed in both plasma and pancreatic tissues. VB6 has been shown to ameliorate the severity of AP through various mechanisms. It effectively reduces the levels of serum amylase, lipase, and inflammatory factors, thereby mitigating histological injury to the pancreas. Moreover, VB6 inhibited pancreatic apoptosis by downregulating bax expression and up-regulating Bcl2 expression in TLCS-treated rats. Additionally, VB6 suppressed the expression of caspase3. The anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of VB6 observed in LPS-treated AR42J cells are consistent with those observed in a rat model of AP. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that VB6 exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects through inhibition of the caspase3 signaling pathway and has a protective effect against AP.",

Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation may also be effective, however, most patients appear to be nonresponsive to this modality of treatment. CASE REPORT: Here, we report a characterized case of a vitamin B6-responsive GACR who had a splicing mutation in the OAT gene. The GACR diagnosis was confirmed through the clinical features, imaging, biochemical findings, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) results. WES data revealed the splicing mutation in intron 4 of the OAT gene (NM_001322967: c.425-1G>A). CONCLUSION: Our knowledge about the diagnosis and treatment of GACR can be improved by identifying novel mutations in the OAT gene and accurate follow-up of the patients to determine how they respond to treatment."

METHODS: A total of 120 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer were enrolled at our hospital from January 2021 to December 2022, and these cases were randomly divided into two groups using a random number table method. The control group was treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, while the study group was treated with sodium cantharidate vitamin B6 on the basis of the control group. The clinical efficacy, changes in self-immune function (CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ cells ratio), tumor marker levels [Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen (SCCA), Carbohydrate Antigen 125 (CA125), Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)], quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire), and incidence of adverse events were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, there was no significant difference in the overall efficacy and disease control rates between the two groups (P > .05). Before treatment, there was no difference in auto-immune function between the two groups (P > .05). However, after treatment, the study group showed a significant improvement in auto-immune function, and when compared to the control group, the levels of CD3+, CD4+ cells, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cells were higher in the study group (P < .05). Before treatment, there was no difference in tumor markers between the two groups (P > .05). While after treatment, tumor markers in both groups decreased significantly, and in comparison to the control group, the levels of SCCA, CA125, and CEA in the study group were lower (P < .05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the quality of life between the two groups (P > .05). However, after treatment, the quality of life in both groups improved, and the study group had a higher quality of life score than the control group (P < .05). There was no significant difference in thrombocytopenia between the two groups (P > .05). The total incidence of leukopenia, neutropenia, and radio-chemotherapy-related gastroenteritis in the study group was lower than that in the control group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Sodium cantharidate vitamin B6 combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of local advanced cervical cancer can not only effectively enhance the autoimmune function, downregulate the level of tumor markers, and improve the quality of patient life, but also cause relatively few adverse reactions.",

Results-At the ultrasound scan, the treatment group showed faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma compared with the control group, both at T1 (control group 140 (112-180), treated group 84 (40-112), p < 0.0031), and T2 (control group: 72 (48-112), treated group: 0 (0-0), p < 0.0001). Moreover, subjective symptoms, such as vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions, showed a faster decrease in the treatment group than in the control group. Conclusions-The association may more rapidly improve the resolution of threatened miscarriage and related symptoms compared to the standard local protocol."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Iron is an essential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. Previous studies have shown that iron supplementation is related to exercise performance and endurance capacity improvements. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects are not well understood. Recent studies have suggested the beneficial impact of iron supplementation on mitochondrial function and its ability to rescue mitochondrial function under adverse stress in vitro and rodents. Based on current knowledge, our study aimed to investigate whether the changes in exercise performance resulting from iron supplementation are associated with its effect on mitochondrial function. METHODS: In this study, we orally administered an iron-based supplement to rats for 30 consecutive days at a dosage of 0.66 mg iron/kg body weight and vitamin B6 at a dosage of 0.46 mg/kg. RESULTS: Our findings reveal that long-term iron supplementation, in combination with vitamin B6, led to less body weight gained and increased VO2 max in rats. Besides, the treatment substantially increased Complex I- and Complex II-driven ATP production in intact mitochondria isolated from gastrocnemius and cerebellum. However, the treatment did not change basal and succinate-induced ROS production in mitochondria from the cerebellum and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the iron intervention significantly upregulated several skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism-related biomarkers, including PGC-1α, SIRT1, NRF-2, SDHA, HSL, MTOR, and LON-P. However, it did not affect the muscular protein expression of SIRT3, FNDC5, LDH, FIS1, MFN1, eNOS, and nNOS. Interestingly, the iron intervention did not exert similar effects on the hippocampus of rats. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our study demonstrates that long-term iron supplementation, in combination with vitamin B6, increases VO2 max, possibly through its positive role in regulating skeletal muscle-specific mitochondrial biogenesis and energy production in rats."

      "abstract": "The study aims to investigate the vitamin B6 levels in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and their association with liver enzymes and evaluate how much dysregulation is associated with levodopa dose. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of Opicapone, a catechol-o-methyl-transferase inhibitor, on vitamin B6 levels by monitoring the AST and ALT levels in patients treated with Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel Infusion (LCIG). For these aims, serum vitamin B6 levels were measured (PD, n = 72 and controls, n = 31). The vitamin B6 level was compared with the total levodopa dose, clinical parameters, and blood homocysteine, albumin, and hemoglobin levels in PD patients. Correlations between vitamin B6 levels and AST and ALT levels, as well as the ratio ALT/AST, were analyzed. Changes in the AST and ALT levels and ALT/AST were analyzed in the patients treated with LCIG before and after the therapy (n = 24) and in the patients treated with LCIG + Opicapone before and after Opicapone treatment (n = 12). We found vitamin B6 levels were significantly lower in PD patients. Total levodopa dose and albumin levels were independently associated with vitamin B6 levels. Decreased vitamin B6 levels appeared as lower AST and ALT levels and ALT/AS. Treatment with LCIG decreased the AST and ALT levels and ALT/AST. Adjunctive therapy with Opicapone to LCIG ameliorated the decreased ALT and ALT/AST. We conclude that the ALT and ALT/AST can be useful parameters for monitoring vitamin B6 levels and Opicapone can ameliorate the dysregulated vitamin B6 in PD patients.",

Vitamin B6 deficiency is well established as a contributor to inflammatory-related conditions, whilst B6 supplementation can reverse these inflammatory effects. There is less information available regarding the effects of high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation as a therapeutic agent. This study set out to examine the effects of high-dose vitamin B6 on an LPS-stimulated monocyte/macrophage cell population via an analysis of protein and gene expression using an RT2 profiler PCR array for Human Innate and Adaptive Immune responses. It was identified that high-dose vitamin B6 has a global anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in monocyte/macrophage cells by downregulating the key broad-spectrum inflammatory mediators CCL2, CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, IL-23-a, TNF-α, CSF2, DDX58, NLRP3, NOD1, NOD2, TLR-1 -2 -4 -5 -7 -8 -9, MYD88, C3, FOXP3, STAT1, STAT3, STAT6, LYZ, CASP-1, CD4, HLA-E, MAPK1, MAPK8 MPO, MX-1, NF-κβ, NF-κβ1A, CD14, CD40, CD40LG, CD86, Ly96, ICAM1, IRF3, ITGAM, and IFCAM2. The outcomes of this study show promise regarding vitamin B6 within the context of a potent broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory mediator and could prove useful as an adjunct treatment for inflammatory-related diseases."

Methods-Data were collected from n = 200 women treated daily with oral supplements of 200 mg HMWHA, 100 mg ALA, 450 mg magnesium, 2.6 mg vitamin B6 and 50 mcg vitamin D (treatment group) and from n = 50 women taking with oral supplements of 400 mg magnesium (control group). In both groups, supplementation started from the 7th gestational week until delivery. Results-Oral treatment with HMWHA, in association with ALA, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin D in pregnant women, significantly reduced adverse events, such as PTB (p < 0.01), pelvic pain and contractions (p < 0.0001), miscarriages (p < 0.05) and admission to ER/hospitalization (p < 0.0001) compared with the control group. Conclusions-Despite HMWHA having been poorly used as a food supplement in pregnant women, our results open a reassuring scenario regarding its oral administration during pregnancy."

It is often used to prevent a variety of neuropathies, relieve vomiting, and relieve symptoms such as hand and foot neuritis. AIM: To evaluate whether vitamin B6 can alleviate the adverse reactions caused by the quadruple anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment regimen containing minocycline and metronidazole. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 280 patients with H. pylori infection were randomly placed into one of two treatment groups-the conventional treatment group and the vitamin B6 supplement treatment group-for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the total incidence of adverse reactions up to 2 weeks after treatment initiation. The study was designed according to CONSORT Medicinal Interventions. And it was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the number ChiCTR2100053833. RESULTS: In terms of efficacy, vitamin B6 does not affect the efficacy of conventional regimen. In the vitamin B6 supplement treatment group, the incidence of adverse reactions was 56.92%, which was significantly lower than the 74.62% observed in the conventional treatment group. In addition, the severity of adverse reactions was also significantly reduced. The proportion of moderate to severe central nervous system symptoms decreased from 58.7 to 14.63%. And, the proportion of moderate to severe gastrointestinal reactions decreased from 33.33 to 0%. We speculate that the mechanism of vitamin B6 of reducing adverse reaction may be related to the production of GABA in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B6 can alleviate adverse reactions of the quadruple anti-H. pylori regimen containing minocycline and metronidazole.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods and is accessible in many dietary supplements. The three natural forms are pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. Both vitamin B6 deficiency and high B6 intake have been described as risk factors for developing peripheral neuropathy (PN). The aim of this systematic review is to characterize and comprehensively describe B6-related PN. METHOD: A systematic, computer-based search was conducted using the PubMed database. Twenty articles were included in this review. RESULTS: Higher vitamin B6 levels, which usually occur following the taking of nutritional supplements, may lead to the development of a predominantly, if not exclusively, sensory neuropathy of the axonal type. After pyridoxine discontinuation, such patients subjectively report improved symptoms. However, although low vitamin B6 levels can be seen in patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy of various etiologies, there is no firm evidence that low B6 levels have a direct causal relationship with PN. Many studies suggest subjective improvement of neuropathy symptoms in patients suffering from PN of various etiologies after receiving B6 supplementation; however, no data about B6 administration as a monotherapy exist, only as part of a combination treatment, usually with other vitamins. Therefore, the potential therapeutic role of B6 cannot be confirmed to date. Supplementation with vitamin B6, even as part of a nutritional multivitamin supplement, has not been proven harmful at permitted daily doses in patients who already suffer from PN. CONCLUSION: Current scientific evidence supports a neurotoxic role of B6 at high levels. Although some studies suggest that low B6 is also a potential risk factor, further studies in this area are needed.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin B6 (VB6) exhibits therapeutic effects towards autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but its specific mechanism is poorly understood. Rat dams were treated with VB6 standard, VB6 deficiency, or VB6 supplementary diet, and the same treatment was provided to their offspring, with their body weights monitored. Three-chambered social test and open field test were employed to evaluate the effect of VB6 on autism-like behaviors. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) generation and synaptic inhibition of neurons in the hippocampus of rat were detected via immunofluorescence staining, followed by the measurement of GABA concentration through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The role of VB6 in the autophagy and apoptosis of cells was determined via Western blot and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). In order to conduct rescue experiments, the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or the activation of GABA was achieved by drug administration to the offspring rats with VB6 deficiency. As a result, no evident difference in weight was observed in the offspring with varied VB6 treatments. VB6 deficiency impaired social interaction; aggravated self-grooming and bowel frequency; decreased GABA concentration, VIAAT, GAD67, vGAT expressions, and LC3 II/LC3 I ratio; increased p62 level and p-mTOR/mTOR ratio; and promoted cell apoptosis. Inhibition of mTOR reversed the effect of VB6 deficiency on cell autophagy. GABA activation or mTOR inhibition offset the role of VB6 deficiency in autism-like behaviors and hippocampal GABA expression. Collectively, VB6 deficiency induces autism-like behaviors in rats by regulating mTOR-mediated autophagy in the hippocampus.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published pediatric cases with a confirmed molecular genetic diagnosis of vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy according to PRISMA guidelines. Data on demographic features, seizure semiology, EEG patterns, neuroimaging, treatment, and developmental outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 497 published patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Seizure onset manifested at 59.8 ± 291.6 days (67.8% of cases in the first month of life). Clonic, tonic-clonic, and myoclonic seizures accounted for two-thirds of the cases, while epileptic spasms were observed in 7.6%. Burst-suppression/suppression-burst represented the most frequently reported specific EEG pattern (14.4%), mainly in PLPB, ALDH7A1, and PNPO deficiency. Pyridoxine was administered to 312 patients (18.5% intravenously, 76.9% orally, 4.6% not specified), and 180 also received antiseizure medications. Pyridoxine dosage ranged between 1 and 55 mg/kg/die. Complete seizure freedom was achieved in 160 patients, while a significant seizure reduction occurred in 38. PLP, lysine-restricted diet, and arginine supplementation were used in a small proportion of patients with variable efficacy. Global developmental delay was established in 30.5% of a few patients in whom neurocognitive tests were performed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the wide variability, the most frequent hallmarks of the epilepsy phenotype in patients with vitamin B6-dependent seizures include generalized or focal motor seizure semiology and a burst suppression/suppression burst pattern in EEG."

Methods: Rabbit corneal epithelial cells were used to assess wound healing and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation by scratch assay and oxidative stress (0.3 mM H2O2; 30 min), respectively with or without ocular formulations exposure. In vivo studies were carried out on albino rabbits to evaluate corneal nerve regeneration and corneal wound healing with or without treatment with six different formulations. Animals were anesthetized, the corneal epithelium was removed, and formulations were topically administered (30 μL/eye; 3 times/day for 6 days). Slit-lamp observation was carried out at different time points. After 6 days the animals were killed, and corneas were collected to evaluate corneal re-innervation by immunohistochemistry of selective neuronal marker β-III tubulin. Results: Formulations containing the concentrations 0.16% or 0.32% of cross-linked sodium hyaluronate, taurine, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 accelerated corneal wound healing. Cells exposed to H2O2 led to significant (p < 0.05) increase of reactive oxygen species concentration that was significantly (p < 0.05) counteract by formulations containing cross-linked sodium hyaluronate (0.32%) and taurine with or without vitamins. The extent of re-innervation, in terms of β-III tubulin staining, was 5-fold greater (p < 0.01) in the eye of rabbits treated with formulation containing 0.32% cross-linked sodium hyaluronate, taurine, vitamins (RenerviX®) compared with the control group (no treatment). Furthermore, re-innervation elicited by RenerviX® was significantly greater (p < 0.01) compared with the group treated with the formulation containing 0.32% cross-linked sodium hyaluronate and taurine without vitamins, and with the group treated with the formulation containing 0.5% linear sodium hyaluronate (SH), taurine, and vitamin B12, respectively. Discussion: In conclusion, among the formulations tested, the new ophthalmic gel RenerviX® was able to contrast oxidative stress, to accelerate corneal re-epithelization and to promote nerve regeneration."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Levetiracetam (LVT), while an effective treatment for multiple seizure types, is associated with a high incidence of neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs). In predominantly retrospective studies, supplementation with pyridoxine/vitamin B6 (PN) was associated with improvement in NPAEs in some people. A previous review highlighted a lack of double-blind, controlled trials of PN for the treatment of NPAEs in individuals treated with LVT. The current paper updates the findings from the previous review to include evidence from studies published since June 2019. METHODS: An updated systematic review of the published literature was performed in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies published between June 2019 and 2nd November 2022 in which supplementary PN was initiated for the treatment of LVT-associated NPAEs. All study types were eligible. The risk of bias in randomized trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: Seven additional studies were identified: two double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), four retrospective studies, and one retrospective case series. One RCT reported significant improvements from baseline in behavioral adverse events (BAEs) in both the intervention (PN) group and the low-dose control group (both p < 0.05), with a significantly greater improvement in the intervention group (p < 0.001). In the second RCT, differences in BAE severity between PN and placebo groups at the endpoint were not statistically significant. In one retrospective study, subjective irritability was reported to have improved from baseline in 9/20 individuals (45%) treated with supplementary PN. Data for systematic assessments (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) were available for 10 individuals. Assessment by PHQ-9 showed that six individuals improved, two worsened and two had no change. Based on the GAD-7, three people improved, two worsened and five had no change. In the second retrospective study, 18/41 individuals (44%) who commenced PN following the emergence of BAEs showed \"significant\" improvement. In a separate group of individuals with pre-existing behavioral problems in whom PN treatment was initiated at the same time as commencing LVT, 3/18 (16.7%) developed BAEs. This compared with 79/458 people (17.2%) who were initially treated only with LVT. The third retrospective study compared treatment-related irritability in individuals who had been treated with both LVT and perampanel, either sequentially or concomitantly. Two people who developed irritability while receiving LVT monotherapy were able to continue treatment with the addition of PN. The fourth study reported a significantly lower LVT discontinuation rate in individuals taking PN and a higher rate of improved behavior in those who were able to continue LVT. The case series reported improvements in behavioral symptoms in six people within two to three weeks of commencing supplementary PN. CONCLUSION: Data published within the last three years add to earlier evidence suggesting that PN might be effective in the treatment of NPAEs associated with LVT. However, the quality of evidence remains poor and only a few prospective trials have been published. Data from placebo-controlled trials are still largely lacking. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to justify any firm recommendation for PN supplementation to treat NPAEs associated with LVT. Further well-designed, prospective trials are warranted.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) are common symptoms in pregnancy. Although no definitive treatment option for NVP, pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) supplementation has been used widely. The present study aims to systematically evaluate the current evidence regarding pyridoxine for the treatment of NVP. METHODS: Data were obtained using a stepwise search process using keywords in the following online medical databases; PubMed®, Web of Science®, and Scopus® for studies published before 1st May 2021. Studies reporting intervention with pyridoxine supplementation alone and/or with other active substances were included. A meta-analysis was performed on the PUQE score and Rhode's score for nausea and vomiting. FINDINGS: Initial database searching indicated 548 potentially eligible articles, of which 18 studies satisfying the inclusion criteria were selected. Eight studies showed beneficial effects with pyridoxine alone as the supplementation, while six others found that the supplementation of pyridoxine in combination with another active substance had favourable effects. Supplementation of pyridoxine alone as well as combined treatment of pyridoxine with an active ingredient as the intervention significantly improved the symptoms of nausea according to Rhode's score [0.78 [95% CI: 0.26, 1.31; p = 0.003; I2 = 57%, p = 0.10)] and PUQE score [0.75 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.22; p = 0.002; I2 = 0%, p = 0.51)], respectively. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of pyridoxine alone as well as with an active ingredient demonstrated beneficial effects for women suffering from NVP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin B6 is essential for life and plays a critical role in many biochemical and physiological processes in the human body. The term B6 collectively refers to 6 water-soluble vitamers, and only the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) serves as the biologically active form. A plasma PLP concentration above 30 nmol/L (7.4 μg/L) is indicative of an adequate vitamin B6 status for all age and sex groups. The currently recommended daily allowance of B6 (1.5-2 mg/d) from dietary sources frequently results in inadequate B6 status (<20 nmol/L or 5 μg/L) in many elderly patients and patients with comorbid conditions. PLP-based supplements are preferred and should be administered weekly in low doses (50-100 mg) to maintain a stable serum PLP level between 30 and 60 nmol/L or 7.4 and 15 μg/L. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: It is challenging for physicians to prescribe a safe dose of B6 supplements because of the narrow therapeutic index. The association between elevated levels of pyridoxine and neuropathy is not well established. PLP-based supplements are shown to be least neurotoxic, but further clinical trials are needed to establish the long-term safety in high doses. DATA SOURCES: PubMed search of randomized control trials and meta-analyses. THERAPEUTIC OPINION: Plasma B6 levels should be ordered as a part of workup of any unexplained anemia before labeling as \"anemia of chronic disease.\" B6 supplementation is also crucial in the management of chronic Mg deficiency resistant to therapy. When B6 is administered daily in supraphysiologic doses, there is a potential for the development of neurotoxicity (typically at levels >100 nmol/L or 25 μg/L). PLP-based supplements are preferred over pyridoxine supplements because of minimal neurotoxicity observed in neuronal cell viability tests. Since B6 metabolites have a long half-life, weekly administration is preferred over daily use to prevent toxicity.",

There are contradicting data about the effectiveness of magnesium and vitamin B6 in alleviating the symptoms of this condition. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the efficacy of magnesium and vitamin B6 in alleviating the symptoms of RLS/WED. METHODS: A single-blind study was conducted on individuals with this illness for at least three months. Randomly, 75 patients were assigned into three groups: magnesium, vitamin B6, and placebo. The experimental group received daily doses of 40 mg vitamin B6 or 250 mg magnesium oxide. While others in the control group merely received a placebo. Patients' disease severity and sleep quality were evaluated three times using standard questionnaires (at the beginning of the study, one and two months after therapy). Utilizing SPSS22 software and the ANOVA, t-test, and repeated measure tests, statistical analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation of sleep quality and disease severity at the beginning of the trial and throughout the first month following the intervention did not differ statistically between the three groups. In the second month following the intervention, the mean and standard deviation of sleep quality and disease severity were significantly different (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Taking magnesium and vitamin B6 supplements can reduce the severity of symptoms of RLS/WED patients and improve their sleep quality.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Recently, the PTB risk has been related to the objective measurement of cervical length (CL), since a CL of less than 25 mm is an accurate predictor of increased risk of PTB. Primary prevention of preterm labor is based on the early identification of symptoms and on pharmacological treatments with tocolytic drugs for inhibition of uterine contractions that are associated with a shortening of the cervix. Unfortunately, most of these drugs have important side effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate whether the administration of a combination of oral α-lipoic acid (ALA), magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin D to pregnant women presenting risk factors for PTB could reduce the rate of cervical shortening at 19-22 weeks of gestational age. RESULTS: A total of 122 women attending the first-trimester aneuploidy screening at 11-14 weeks of pregnancy and presenting risk factors for PTB were included in the study. Cervical length significantly decreased in the control group compared with the treatment group (-3.86 ± 1.97 vs. 1.50 ± 1.26; p=0.02). Although the rate of preterm birth did not significantly decrease (9.5% vs. 5.1%), admission for threatened PTB was statistically reduced in the treatment group compared with the control group (3.4% vs. 14.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation of ALA, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin D significantly counteracted cervix shortening in pregnant women presenting risk factors for PTB.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endocrine disorders such as amenorrhea, lactation, and irregular menstruation caused by antipsychotics are common in female patients. How to reduce or eliminate these adverse reactions is a matter of concern. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of progesterone in combination with vitamin B6 in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced amenorrhea. METHODS: In our hospital, from May 2019 to May 2021, 120 patients with amenorrhea caused by antipsychotics who underwent surgery were selected for this prospective study. The random residue grouping method divided them into a progesterone group (60 cases) and a vitamin B6 group (60 cases). Among them, the progesterone group was treated only with progesterone, while the vitamin B6 group was given progesterone in combination with vitamin B6. The differences in endocrine index, prolactin, uterine size, and endometrial thickness, effectiveness, and safety analysis of the progesterone and vitamin B6 groups of patients were observed and compared. RESULTS: Before treatment, there was no change in the comparison of endocrine indexes between the progesterone and vitamin B6 groups (P > 0.05). After 1 month of treatment, there were significant differences in estradiol, prolactin, and follicle-stimulating hormone between the progesterone and vitamin B6 groups of patients (P < 0.05). After 1 month of treatment, there were significant differences in prolactin, uterine size, and endometrial thickness, and the vitamin B6 group was significantly lower than the progesterone group (P < 0.05). The clinical efficiency of 95.00% in the vitamin B6 group was significantly higher than 83.33% in the progesterone group (P < 0.05). There were no adverse reactions in the progesterone and vitamin B6 groups. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of progesterone combined with vitamin B6 in treating amenorrhea caused by antipsychotics is significantly better than simple progesterone, which can effectively improve the endocrine condition of patients and provide a reference for the clinical treatment of amenorrhea caused by antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "Carbidopa-levodopa has been used for more than 50 years in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) and other movement disorders. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), an active form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), is involved in the decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine; carbidopa, which is combined with levodopa to reduce peripheral levodopa conversion and minimize peripheral dopamine side effects, binds irreversibly with PLP. As a result, carbidopa-levodopa may cause vitamin B6 deficiency and associated sequelae, including seizures, especially in high doses. A 78-year-old gentleman with a 6-year history of PD on carbidopa-levodopa therapy and recent weight loss presented with new-onset myoclonus and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Workup for vascular, infectious, malignant, metabolic, and autoimmune causes of seizure was unrevealing. The folate level was critically low at <2.20 ng/dL. Video EEG studies showed moderate cerebral dysfunction and seizures with diffuse onsets. Several anti-seizure medications (ASMs) were unsuccessfully tried, so empiric treatment with high-dose steroids was initiated eventually alongside intravenous vitamin B6 therapy. Following introduction of these interventions, the patient had no further epileptic events. The vitamin B6 level came back as undetectable at <1 μg/dL. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center for improved strength and function. At the time of writing, he remained on two ASMs as well as IV B6 supplementation. Vitamin B6 is a required cofactor in the decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine, and high levodopa dosages may cause B6 deficiency; in addition, carbidopa binds B6 irreversibly. We recommend screening of vitamin B6 levels in PD patients, especially those requiring high or increasing doses of carbidopa-levodopa and those with poor nutrition."

In the current study, we synthesized vitamin B6 derived ligand (L) and its complex Pt(L)Cl (C1). The ancillary chloride ligand of C1 was exchanged with pyridine co-ligand and another complex Pt(L)(py).BF4 (C2) was obtained. Both these complexes were obtained in excellent isolated yields and characterized thoroughly by different analytical methods. Thyroid cancer is one of the most common malignancies of the endocrine system, we studied the in vitro anticancer activity and mechanism of these vitamin B6 derived L and Pt(II) complexes in thyroid cancer cell line (FTC). Based on MTT assay, cell proliferation rate was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. According to apoptosis analysis, vitamin B6 based Pt(II) complexes treated cells depicted necrotic effect and TUNEL based apoptosis was observed in cancer cells. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analyses of cancer cells treated with C1 and/or C2 showed regulated expression of anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptosis and autophagy related genes. Western blot results demonstrated that C1 and C2 induced the activation of p53 and the cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results suggest that these complexes inhibit the growth of FTC cells and induce apoptosis through p53 signaling. Thus, vitamin B6 derived Pt(II) complexes C1 and C2 may be potential cytotoxic agents for the treatment of thyroid cancer.",

These side effects may be improved by supplemental vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) use. Our research aimed to study risk factors for LEV side effects and the role of vitamin B6 in altering this risk. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the demographic and clinical profile of all pediatric patients on LEV treatment between July 2019 and December 2020. T-tests, Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to assess predictors of LEV discontinuation. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: 150/240 (62%) children were on additional medications besides LEV for epilepsy management. Thirty-five percent children reported side effects, especially behavioral and mood concerns. Of the patients who reported side effects on LEV, 71% were taking vitamin B6 (n = 59). The rate of LEV discontinuation was significantly lower for children on vitamin B6 than children not taking B6, regardless of monotherapy or polypharmacy (49% v 88% respectively, p = 0.001). Over half of the patients who were able to remain on LEV reported improved behavior with B6 supplementation as compared to those who were unable to continue LEV (17/30, 57% versus 0/26, 0%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Levetiracetam side effects significantly impact the tolerability of this ASM in children with epilepsy. Our results suggest that vitamin B6 supplementation can significantly reduce the odds of discontinuing LEV due to its behavioral side effects.",

This study aimed to evaluate whether an 80-mg daily dose of vitamin B6 improves pain, disease severity and psychological symptoms of FM compared to a placebo. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was performed on the FM patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by a rheumatologist based on the 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR). 90 Patients were randomized to receive either vitamin B6 (80 mg daily) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with a permuted block size of 30 stratified by disease severity. Primary outcomes included the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12), and pain visual analog scale (pain-VAS)). The mean differences in outcomes (before and after treatment) were compared between the vitamin B6 and placebo groups using an independent T-test. An ANCOVA model adjusted for baseline outcome value was also provided to compare the outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Of 90 eligible patients, 60 patients (31 patients in vitamin B6 and 29 in the placebo group) completed the trial. Overall, the FIQR, pain-VAS, and HADS-anxiety scores improved after treatment in both vitamin B6 and placebo groups; However, there was no statistically significant intergroup difference regarding primary outcomes. ANCOVA model also showed no difference in the treatment effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed no priority for vitamin B6 over placebo in FM patients. Considering the potential ameliorating role of vitamin B6 on pain and psychological symptoms, acknowledgment of vitamin B6 as a relatively safe adjuvant treatment needs larger future studies.

METHODS: The clinical features, genetics, and follow-up data of 30 patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The age of epileptic spasms (ES) onset was from 3 months to 12 months. They all received high doses of vitamin B6 at different times after the onset of ES, ranging from 1 day to 5 months. ES were controlled within 11 days in 93% (28/30) patients, and as late as 1 month and 2 months in the other two patients. In the course of treatment, 28 patients were seizure-free all the time, and seizures of other two patients recurred due to withdrawal of vitamin B6. The available follow-up EEG results of 28 patients were normal in 26 cases, and 81% (21/26) had suppressed epileptic discharges within 6 months. Of the 26 cases with normal follow up EEG, 4 had developmental delay and 22 had normal development. The time for EEG to return to normal in 22 patients with normal development ranged from 14 days to 2 years (mean = 111.5 days; median = 52.5 days). The time for EEG to return to normal in the other 4 patients with development delay ranged from 4 months to 2 years (mean = 375 days; median = 330 days). To the last follow-up, seizures were controlled well in 29 surviving patients, and 21 patients were able to deactivate from all medications without seizures recurrence. Sixteen patients showed varying degrees of developmental delay after onset. After seizure control, the psychomotor development was delayed in 7 patients (one died) until the last follow-up. Genetic analysis did not show any meaningful results. CONCLUSION: An observation period of 1-2 weeks is essential to identify patients with vitamin B6-responsive IS. The treatment time could be extended according to the treatment response and EEG changes. It might take a longer time for EEG to return to normal and to stop taking drugs in patients with persistent or unimproved developmental delay. Neurodevelopmental outcomes and prognosis of vitamin B6-responsive IS were relatively favorable."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Vitamin B6 status and mortality risk are inversely associated in different patient groups, while prospective studies in the general population are lacking. Here, for the first time, we evaluated the association between biomarkers of vitamin B6 status and mortality risk in a large population-based study. METHODS: The vitamin B6 vitamers pyridoxal-5'-phosphat (PLP) and 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2005 and 2010. Participants' vital status and causes of death were recorded until December 2015. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were carried out to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality across quintiles of PLP, 4-PA, and the ratio of 4-PA and PLP. RESULTS: Out of 15,304 study participants aged between 20 and 85 years at baseline, 1666 (7.7%) died during a median follow-up time of 7.8 years. An inverse association between PLP and mortality was found in a multivariable model adjusted for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors but became statistically non-significant upon adjustment for routine biomarkers (C-reactive protein, creatinine, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase). There was a significant linear trend for a positive association between 4-PA levels and mortality risk in the fully adjusted regression model, although a comparison of extreme quintiles (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1) did not show a significant difference (HRQ5vs.Q1 (95% CI): 1.19 (0.93, 1.51), plinear trend = 0.02). A positive association between the 4-PA/PLP ratio and all-cause mortality was observed in the multivariable model, with an HRsQ5vs.Q1 of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.85; plinear trend<0.0001). There were no significant associations between the biomarkers and cardiovascular or cancer mortality. The association between 4-PA/PLP and mortality risk was heterogeneous across age groups, and only statistically significant among participants older than 65 years at baseline (HRQ5vs.Q1 (95% CI): 1.72 (1.29, 2.29), plinear trend<0.0001). In this group, 4-PA/PLP was also associated with cancer mortality, with an HR Q5vs.Q1 of 2.16 (1.20, 3.90), plinear trend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Increased vitamin B6 turnover, as indicated by a higher 4-PA/PLP ratio, was associated with all-cause and cancer mortality among the older U.S. general population. Intervention trials are needed to assess whether older individuals with a high 4-PA/PLP ratio would benefit from increased vitamin B6 intake.",

VB6 deficiency is a well-recognized complication of levodopa/carbidopa therapy, as metabolism of levodopa to dopamine is VB6-dependent, and carbidopa irreversibly forms bonds and deactivates VB6. We herein report a 75-year-old man with advanced Parkinson's disease who developed severe VB6 deficiency anemia due to levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel therapy. His anemia was promptly resolved with simple oral supplementation of pyridoxal phosphate hydrate. VB6 deficiency anemia can mimic myelodysplastic syndrome and thus is an important differential diagnosis for patients administered levodopa/carbidopa.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The etiology of POEMS syndrome and its associated polyneuropathy have not been fully elucidated. The clinical picture of POEMS-associated polyneuropathy and nutritional polyneuropathy due to vitamin B6 (VB6) deficiency are strikingly similar, both being typically sensorimotor, symmetrical, stocking and glove distribution, and more severe in the lower extremities. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two consecutive POEMS patients with VB6 deficiency who showed unusual rapid and drastic recovery of polyneuropathies within 6-8 weeks after oral VB6 supplementation. Case 1 was supplemented with VB6 from time of autologous stem cell transplantation. Polyneuropathy began to improve within one week, and he became walker-free and could walk unaided with a cane within 6 weeks. Case 2 was supplemented with VB6 from time of stem cell harvest, and he became cane-free and his gait almost normalized within two months. Nerve conduction studies were also confirmatory of neurologic recovery in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: Objective physical improvement of POEMS-associated polyneuropathy has been reported to typically require approximately a year after autologous stem cell transplantation, and together with our observations of VB6 deficiency and supplementations leading to accelerated recoveries of polyneuropathy, VB6 deficiency most probably contributes to POEMS-associated polyneuropathy. VB6 acts as a coenzyme in approximately 150 biochemical reactions. VB6 has been reported to inhibit the hypoxia-inducible factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, and VEGF levels are known to corollate with disease activity of POEMS syndrome. Therefore, VB6 deficiency may contribute not only to POEMS-associated polyneuropathy, but also to the etiology of POEMS syndrome itself.",

Amounting evidence arising by next-generation sequencing techniques have led to the definition of new phenotypes, such as neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (NEE), expanding the spectrum of KCNQ2-related epilepsies. Pyridoxine (PN) dependent epilepsies (PDE) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders associated with neonatal-onset seizures responsive to treatment with vitamin B6 (VitB6). Few cases of neonatal seizures due to KCNQ2 pathogenic variants have been reported as successfully responding to VitB6. We reported two cases of KCNQ2-related neonatal epilepsies involving a 5-year-old male with a paternally inherited heterozygous mutation (c.1639C>T; p.Arg547Trp), and a 10-year-old female with a de novo heterozygous mutation (c.740C>T; p.Ser247Leu). Both children benefited from VitB6 treatment. Although the mechanisms explaining the efficacy of VitB6 in such patients remain unclear, this treatment option in neonatal-onset seizures is easily taken into account in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Further studies should be conducted to better define clinical guidelines and treatment protocols."

It has been suggested that anxiety occurs in 2-45% patients affected by Tourette syndrome. Despite dietary and nutritional factors have been found to affect a range of neurological conditions, no more studies have investigated the relationship between nutritional supplements and tics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation of both L-Theanine and Vitamin B6 in reducing tics and co-occurring disorders in a sample of youth with chronic tic disorder (CTD) or Tourette syndrome with anxiety symptoms. DESIGN: A open-label trial. Patients affected by Tourette syndrome were randomized to receive nutritional supplements based on L-Theanine and vitamin B6, or psychoeducation (PE). PARTICIPANTS: 34 children (30 boys and 4 girls) aged between 4 and 17 years affected by Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, associated with anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Patients in both groups showed a reduction in the severity of tic and anxiety symptoms. Supplementation with L-Theanine and vitamin B6 was significantly more effective than psychoeducation in reducing tics and co-occurring disorders, as measured by neuropsychological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of both L-Theanine and Vitamin B6 may help in the treatment of tic disorders associated with anxious symptoms. Between-group differences in clinician-rated severity did reach statistical significance only for tics. Despite this finding, further placebo-controlled trials are needed.",

The purpose of this crossover study was to determine whether vitamin B6 supplementation reduced symptoms of depression and improved mood states in college women using OC. Participants were healthy (aged 18-25 yrs), did not take dietary supplements, and used OC (estrogen with progestin) consistently for at least 1 year. During the 12-week, randomized, double-blind crossover trial (4-week treatment periods [100 mg vitamin B6 daily or placebo] separated by a 4-week washout) participants (n = 8) maintained normal exercise and eating patterns and recorded tablet consumption daily. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Profile of Mood States (POMS) were used to assess mental health before and after each 4-week treatment period. Average dietary vitamin B6 intakes did not vary during the trial (1.2-1.4 mg/d), whereas vitamin B6 status rose significantly following the B6 supplementation period compared to the other three time points. BDI-II scores were reduced 20% by vitamin B6 supplementation in comparison to an 11% rise with placebo ingestion (p = 0.046). POMS scores were not significantly impacted by vitamin B6 supplementation. These preliminary data support a growing literature suggesting the benefits of B6 supplementation for reducing symptoms of depression in young women using OC.",

AIMS: To investigate the effect of vitamin B6 on the prevention of postpartum depression (PPD) among mothers at risk for PPD. METHODS: This single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 81 pregnant women who were at risk of PPD from February to July 2016 at six selected health centers in Isfahan, Iran. A simple random sampling method was adopted. Forty cases and 41 controls received 80 mg vitamin B6 and placebo, respectively from the 28th week until the end of pregnancy. The risk of PPD was assessed as the main inclusion criteria using a structured clinical interview using hospital anxiety-depressive scale (HADS), social support appraisals scale (SS-A), and Holmes and Rahe life change and stress evaluation questionnaire (HRLCSEQ). The Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS) was used to assess the rate of depression prior to and 1.5 months after the intervention (end of pregnancy). Data were analyzed using SPSS 20 and statistical tests (Chi-square, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney's, and Exact Fisher Test). RESULTS: Forty-three subjects were assigned to each group and the final analysis comprised 81 subjects (40 in the case and 41 in the control groups), the mean age of the case and control groups being 5.8 ± 29.6 and 4.6 ± 28.2, respectively. The mean depression score was 10.4 ± 1.4 in the case and 9.3 ± 4.2 in control groups (P = 0.34) before and 4.2 ± 2.7 in the case and 10.4 ± 3.4 in control groups (P < 0.001) after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B6 has a positive effect on reducing postpartum depression scores among mothers at risk for PPD. These may be clinically useful for preventing PPD in high-risk women."

      "abstract": "We have previously reported that the long-term exposure of Isocarbophos, a kind of organophosphorus compounds, induces vascular dementia (VD) in rats. Studies have also shown that organophosphorus compounds have adverse effects on offsprings. Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme mainly involved in the regulation of metabolism and has been demonstrated to ameliorate VD. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a biologically active lipid, plays a vital role in the cardiovascular system. However, whether S1P is involved in the therapeutic effects of Vitamin B6 on posterior cerebral artery injury has yet to be further answered. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential influence of Vitamin B6 on Isocarbophos-induced posterior cerebral artery injury in offspring rats and the role of the S1P receptor in this process. We found that Vitamin B6 significantly improves the vasoconstriction function of the posterior cerebral artery in rats induced by Isocarbophos by the blood gas analysis and endothelium-dependent relaxation function assay. We further demonstrated that Vitamin B6 alleviates the Isocarbophos-induced elevation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-1, and IL-6 by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. By performing immunofluorescence and the western blot assay, we revealed that Vitamin B6 prevents the down-regulation of S1P in posterior cerebral artery injury. It is worth noting that Fingolimod, the S1P inhibitor, significantly inhibits the Vitamin B6-induced up-regulation of S1P in posterior cerebral artery injury. Collectively, our data indicate that Vitamin B6 may be a novel drug for the treatment of posterior cerebral artery injury and that S1P may be a drug target for its treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Vitamin B6 has been linked to a variety of probable roles, including anti-inflammatory, homocysteine-lowering, serotonin-regulating, and dopamine-lowering. In this study, we investigated the possible effect of vitamin B6 on bipolar disorder in manic episode with psychotic feature in a placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial in a psychiatric hospital. METHODS: This study was performed on 50 patients who were equally divided into two groups (each group included 25 patients) using 80 mg of vitamin B6 daily or placebo. At the beginning and end of the study, they were evaluated for lab tests, inflammatory biomarkers and level of blood homocysteine. Also, at the baseline and in weeks 2, 4, and 8, they were evaluated based on the anthropometric measurements, score obtained from the Young Mania Questionnaire, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire. RESULTS: Accordingly, based on Yang Mania scoring scale, no significant difference was observed between the two groups receiving vitamin B6 and placebo (22.68 ± 5.39 vs. 21.80 ± 5.39 [p-value = .51]). Based on MMSE, significant improvement in cognitive status was obtained in group placebo compared to vitamin B6 group (25.24 ± 1.96 vs. 24.40 ± 3.25, respectively [p-value = .01]). At the Pittsburg scale (total, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups receiving vitamin B6 and placebo (1.04 ± 0.20 vs. 0.48 ± 0.50 [p-value = .23]). Additionally, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the anthropometric status. CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, the daily dose of 80 mg of vitamin B6 for 8 weeks in patients with bipolar disorder in the manic episode with psychotic feature treated daily with lithium, was not associated with a significant improvement in mood status compared to the control-placebo group. It is recommended to perform similar studies in a multi-center manner with a larger sample size and longer duration.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of high-dose vitamin B6 (vB6) as an adjunct treatment for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia (AIHP) in male patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). In this randomized double-blinded controlled study, patients were randomized (1:1) into a control group given aripiprazole (ARI; 10 mg/day; n = 100) or an intervention group given vB6 (300 mg/12 h for 16 weeks; n = 100). Prolactin levels, psychotic symptoms [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)], cognitive function [MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)], liver function, kidney function, growth hormone level, micronutrient levels, blood lipids, and adverse secondary effects (ASEs)[Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) and Barnes-Akathisia scale] were monitored. After a 16-week treatment period, the vB6 group showed a 68.1% reduction in serum prolactin levels (from 95.52 ± 6.30 μg/L to 30.43 ± 18.65 μg/L) while the ARI group showed only a 37.4% reduction (from 89.07 ± 3.59 μg/L to 55.78 ± 7.39 μg/L). During weeks 1-4, both treatments reduced prolactin similarly. Subsequently, the ARI effect plateaued, while the vB6 effect remained robust. The vB6 group showed better alleviation of psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment. No serious ASEs were observed; ASEs were more frequent in the ARI group. AIHP reduction efficacy of vB6 was associated with baseline prolactin and triglyceride levels, total vB6 dosage, and education level. In conclusion, compared with the ARI group, TRS patients given vB6 showed better attenuation of AIHP, lower ASE scores, and greater improvements in clinical symptoms and cognitive impairments. These results support further consideration of vB6 as a putative treatment for AIHP. Trial Registration: ChiCTR1800014755."

      "abstract": "Although overt vitamin B6 deficiency is rare, marginal vitamin B6 deficiency is frequent and occurs in a consistent proportion of the population. The marginal vitamin B6 deficiency appears to relate to an increased risk of inflammation-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Of all the cardiovascular diseases, heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome associated with a high mortality rate. So far, information regarding the cardioprotective mechanisms of vitamin B6 has been limited. Meanwhile, recent studies have revealed that vitamin B6 treatment increases cardiac levels of imidazole dipeptides (e.g., carnosine, anserine, and homocarnosine), histamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and suppresses P2X7 receptor-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome. These modulations may imply potential cardioprotective mechanisms of vitamin B6. These modulations may also be involved in the underlying mechanisms through which vitamin B6 suppresses oxidative stress and inflammation. This review provides an up-to-date evaluation of our current understanding of the cardioprotective mechanisms of vitamin B6.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diverse conclusions have been drawn regarding the association of homocysteine (HCY) deficiency and supplements of B vitamins with fracture incidence in older adults. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association of HCY and B vitamins (folate, vitamin B12, and B6) with fracture incidence in older adults and whether supplements of B vitamins reduce the risk of fracture. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched from their inception dates to 1 July 2019 to identify relevant published articles. Meta-analysis was performed to pool hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. High serum HCY was an independent risk factor for fractures in older persons (HR =1.25, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.40), but only at the highest quartile level (>15 µmol/L) (HR =1.71, 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.12), rather than the second and third quartile. Multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses supported the consistency and stability of this result. A severe deficiency of folate, instead of vitamin B12 and B6, was found to increase the risk of fracture in older adults (HR =1.46, 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.02; 1.24, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.95; 1.36, 95% CI: 0.90 to 2.06, respectively). For the interventional effect, there was no significant association of combined folate and vitamin B12, combined folate, vitamin B12 and B6, or single vitamin B6 supplementation with the decrease of fracture risk. DISCUSSION: This meta-analysis revealed that significantly elevated serum level of HCY is positively associated with fracture incidence in older adults, yet the necessity and threshold for intervention by B vitamins require further large-scale high-quality clinical trials to validate.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of hyperlipidemia are increasing year by year, showing a younger trend. At present, the treatment of hyperlipidemia is mainly dependent on western medicine, but its side effects on liver and kidney function are common in clinics. Therefore, it is necessary to study the treatment of hyperlipidemia by augmenting effective dietary nutrition supplements. Vitamin B6 (VitB6), as an essential cofactor for enzymes, participates in lipid metabolism. The effects of VitB6 on hyperlipidemia, however, have not been reported until now. AIM: The present study was to investigate the influence of VitB6 on hepatic lipid metabolism in hyperlipidaemia rats induced by a High-Fat Diet (HFD). METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were kept on HFD for two weeks to establish the hyperlipidemia model. The rats in low-dosage and high-dosage groups were received 2.00 and 3.00 mg/kg/- day of VitB6 for eight weeks, respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that both doses of VitB6 reduced HFD-induced hepatic Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C); decreased blood cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, LDL-C, atherogenic index (AI), Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and ApoB/apolipoprotein A-1(ApoA1) ratio; increased liver High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) and serum ApoA1; reduced hepatic steatosis and triglyceride accumulation, lowered fat storage, and recovered heart/body and brain/body ratio to a normal level. In addition, VitB6 supplementation markedly decreased HMGR level, increased the mRNA abundance of LDLR and CYP7A1, and protein expression of SIRT1, following the downregulation of SREBP-1 and PPARγ protein expression in the liver of hyperlipidemia rats. CONCLUSION: In summary, oral VitB6 supplementation can ameliorate HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and dyslipidemia in SD rats by inhibiting fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, promoting fatty acid decomposition and cholesterol transport.",

      "abstract": "Malaria is still today one of the most concerning diseases, with 219 million infections in 2019, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, causing approx. 409,000 deaths per year. Despite the tremendous advances in malaria treatment and prevention, there is still no vaccine for this disease yet available and the increasing parasite resistance to already existing drugs is becoming an alarming issue globally. In this context, several potential targets for the development of new drug candidates have been proposed and, among those, the de novo biosynthesis pathway for the B6 vitamin was identified to be a promising candidate. The reason behind its significance is the absence of the pathway in humans and its essential presence in the metabolism of major pathogenic organisms. The pathway consists of two enzymes i.e. Pdx1 (PLP synthase domain) and Pdx2 (glutaminase domain), the last constituting a transient and dynamic complex with Pdx1 as the prime player and harboring the catalytic center. In this review, we discuss the structural biology of Pdx1 and Pdx2, together with and the understanding of the PLP biosynthesis provided by the crystallographic data. We also highlight the existing evidence of the effect of PLP synthesis inhibition on parasite proliferation. The existing data provide a flourishing environment for the structure-based design and optimization of new substrate analogs that could serve as inhibitors or even suicide inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Levetiracetam, a commonly prescribed antiseizure medication (ASM), may cause irritability, depression, and anger. The mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects and individual risk factors remain unknown. Mitigation strategies are limited, including discontinuation, supplementation with vitamin B6, or switching to an alternative ASM. Several retrospective studies and anecdotal reports, primarily in pediatric populations, suggest vitamin B6 supplementation may be helpful in reducing levetiracetam-associated irritability. Although data in adult patients is limited, and no data is available for Veterans. The objective of this project was to describe our preliminarily experience with vitamin B6 supplementation for alleviating levetiracetam-associated irritability in male Veterans with epilepsy. METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were completed for patients who had an active prescription for levetiracetam from the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital from January 1, 2015 to June 1, 2020. A total of 26 charts were screened. Patients were excluded if not using vitamin B6 supplementation or if deceased at end of data collection. Baseline characteristics were compared, including age, sex, comorbidities, and concomitant medications. Charts were then reviewed to identify any clinical description of irritability, including subjective assessment of change in symptoms across multiple visits, and scores from standardized instruments including the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-7), and/or irritability in adult patients with epilepsy (I-EPI) questionnaire. These symptoms and scores were then compared pre- and post-B6 supplementation. RESULTS: Of 22 patients, data was available for 20 (91%). For patients with data available, 9 (45%) showed improved irritability following supplementation with vitamin B6 and 11 (55%) showed no improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This project suggests that vitamin B6 supplementation may have a role in mitigating levetiracetam-associated irritability in a male Veteran population. These results support future prospective controlled studies to assess further the efficacy of this approach and characteristics associated with successful treatment in veterans."

This study aimed to assess the effect of vitamin B6, B9, and B12 supplementation on homocysteine level, risk of stroke, cardiovascular disorders, and vascular death among stroke participants. An extensive literature search was done through PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Clinical key database from 1 January 2000 to 1 January 2020. Effect of vitamin B (B6, B9, and B12) supplementation on homocysteine was assessed with a mean difference in both vitamin and placebo groups. Risk ratio (RR) was calculated for determining the risk of stroke, major cardiovascular disorder, and vascular death by using a fixed-effect model. A total of eight trials with 8513 participants were included for the final analysis. Vitamin B supplementation intervention was found to have a significant benefit in reducing homocysteine in stroke patients (mean difference -3.84; p<0.00001). The intervention of vitamin B supplementation showed a significant risk reduction of 11% for combined risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death among stroke patients, 13% for stroke and 17% for vascular death, whereas no beneficial effect was seen for cardiovascular disorders. This meta-analysis demonstrated up-to-date evidence on the beneficial effect of vitamin B supplementations in reducing homocysteine and preventing the combined risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death among stroke patients."

      "abstract": "We have reported that a subpopulation of patients with schizophrenia have lower levels of vitamin B6 (VB6) in peripheral blood than do healthy controls. In a previous study, we found that VB6 level was inversely proportional to the patient's positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS) score for measuring symptom severity, suggesting that the loss of VB6 might contribute to the development of schizophrenia symptoms. In the present study, to clarify the relationship between VB6 deficiency and schizophrenia, we generated VB6-deficient (VB6(-)) mice through feeding with a VB6-lacking diet as a mouse model for the subpopulation of schizophrenia patients with VB6 deficiency. After feeding for 4 weeks, plasma VB6 level in VB6(-) mice decreased to 3% of that in control mice. The VB6(-) mice showed social deficits and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the VB6(-) mice showed a marked increase in 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in the brain, suggesting enhanced noradrenaline (NA) metabolism in VB6(-) mice. We confirmed the increased NA release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the striatum (STR) of VB6(-) mice through in vivo microdialysis. Moreover, inhibiting the excessive NA release by treatment with VB6 supplementation into the brain and α2A adrenoreceptor agonist guanfacine (GFC) suppressed the increased NA metabolism and ameliorated the behavioral deficits. These findings suggest that the behavioral deficits shown in VB6(-) mice are caused by enhancement of the noradrenergic (NAergic) system.",

However, no study has investigated the efficacy of vitamin B6 supplementation in these patients. The aim of this open-label, single-arm, single-center study was to examine the therapeutic effect of vitamin B6 in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Twenty-two patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease received vitamin B6 (90 mg/day) orally for 12 weeks. Clinical parameters were evaluated, and liver fat and fibrosis were quantified before and after treatment using magnetic resonance imaging-based proton density fat fraction and magnetic resonance elastography. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels, the primary endpoint, did not change significantly after vitamin B6 treatment (93.6 ± 46.9 to 93.9 ± 46.6, p = 0.976). On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging-based proton density fat fraction, a parameter of hepatic lipid accumulation, was significantly reduced (18.7 ± 6.1 to 16.4 ± 6.4, p<0.001) despite no significant changes in body mass index, even in those not taking vitamin E (n = 17, 18.8 ± 6.9 to 16.7 ± 7.3, p = 0.0012). Vitamin B6 administration significantly ameliorated hepatic fat accumulation. As an inexpensive agent with few side effects, vitamin B6 could be a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease."

However, it is unclear whether different doses of vitamin B6 have distinct effects on the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study investigated the relationship between different doses of B6 intake and the prognosis of NPC patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis included 792 newly diagnosed NPC patients with a median follow-up of 62.05 months. Restricted cubic spline and maximally selected rank statistics were performed to determine the cut-off value of vitamin B6 during treatment (VB6DT). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were performed to analyze survival outcomes. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was performed to determine the independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: NPC patients were divided into three groups according to the cut-off value of VB6DT: non-users (0 mg/d), VB6DT > 8.6 mg/d, and VB6DT ≤ 8.6 mg/d. Patients with VB6DT > 8.6 mg/d had significantly lower 5-year overall survival (OS) (83.5% vs. 90.8%, p = 0.006), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (83.5% vs. 91.0%, p = 0.004), and progression-free survival (PFS) (73.7% vs. 81.7%, p = 0.011) and slightly but not significantly lower 5-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (87.7% vs. 90.7%, p = 0.214) than the non-users. Patients with VB6DT ≤ 8.6 mg/d had slightly but not significantly better 5-year OS (93.3% vs. 90.8%, p = 0.283) than the non-users, while all other primary endpoints were similar (p > 0.50). Multivariable analyses confirmed that VB6DT > 8.6 mg/d was an independent negative prognostic factor of OS (p = 0.010), DMFS (p = 0.017), and PFS (p = 0.030) but not of LRFS (p = 0.428). CONCLUSIONS: Excessive VB6DT higher than the cut-off value is an independent negative prognostic factor for NPC patients.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-year-old Chinese girl complained about night blindness and progressive decreased vision in both eyes. Her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/63 OD and 20/100 OS. Fundus examination showed bilateral multiple, sharply demarcated, scallop-shaped chorioretinal atrophy areas in the midperipheral and peripheral of the fundus. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed increased central macular thickness (CMT) with multiple intraretinal cystic spaces in the both eyes. There was no leakage or staining in the macular area in late phase of fluorescein angiography (FA). Blood tests confirmed hyperornithinemia and genetic analysis revealed two heterozygous mutations on ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) gene. Based on clinical presentation and genetic test, the patient was diagnosed as GA of the choroid and retina and further treated with vitamin B6 supplementary for three weeks. Her serum ornithine levels did not change but CMT on SD-OCT declined with partial regression of intraretinal cystic spaces. Then, the patient discontinued the drug because of severe muscle pain, and foveoschisis increased to initial level a month later. CONCLUSIONS: Foveoschisis is a rare complication of GA. Vitamin B6 supplementation may alleviate foveoschisis, but its effort for reducing serum ornithine level might be limited. Potential drug adverse effects should be noted in pediatric patients.",

      "abstract": "Polyglutamine (polyQ)-mediated mitochondria damage is one of the prime causes of polyQ toxicity, which leads to the loss of neurons and the injury of non-neuronal cells. With the discovery of the crucial role of the gut-brain axis and gut microbes in neurological diseases, the relationship between visceral damage and neurological disorders has also received extensive attention. This study successfully simulated the polyQ mitochondrial damage model by expressing 78 or 84 polyglutamine-containing Ataxin3 proteins in Drosophila intestinal enterocytes. In vivo, polyQ expression can reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial DNA damage, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and loose mitochondrial cristae. Expression profiles evaluated by RNA-seq showed that mitochondrial structural genes and functional genes (oxidative phosphorylation and tricarboxylic acid cycle-related) were significantly down-regulated. More importantly, Bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that pathological polyQ expression induced vitamin B6 metabolic pathways abnormality. Active vitamin B6 participates in hundreds of enzymatic reactions and is very important for maintaining mitochondria's activities. In the SCA3 Drosophila model, Vitamin B6 supplementation significantly suppressed ECs mitochondria damage in guts and inhibited cellular polyQ aggregates in fat bodies, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of polyQ. Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the Vitamin B6-mediated mitochondrial protection in polyQ-induced cellular toxicity, which provides strong evidence for this process as a drug target in polyQ diseases treatment.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the mainstream curative treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is combined liver and kidney transplantation, and only kidney transplantation is considered ineffective for most PH1 patients. Furthermore, vitamin B6 (B6) is the only permitted drug available for treatment. However, except for specific mutations such as G170R and F152I in gene AGXT, data of B6 effect on other mutations are lacking. Insufficient research has evaluated the efficacy of the combination of kidney transplantation and B6 treatment in the therapeutic strategy in PH1 patients. Here, we report a case of a 52-year-old male with frequent stone events and end-stage renal diseases (ESRD), and subsequently undergone kidney transplantation. Sudden rising of serum creatinine within two months after the transplantation. After gene sequencing, the mutations of A186V, R197Q, and I340M were presented in gene AGXT. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with PH1. B6 administration was attempted during the period of waiting for liver transplantation. Four-week oral B6 therapy (50 mg tid) reduced the serum creatinine of the patient from 194 to 145 µmol/L, which revealed that the patient probably responded to B6 treatment. At the almost three-year follow-up, the patient's serum creatinine remained reduced (130 µmol/L), without urinary oxalate excretion. In this case, we established a positive effect, even a beneficial result, of the use of B6 as a retrospective therapeutic choice in PH1 treatment after kidney transplantation."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Vitamin B6-dependent epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders usually characterized by neonatal onset seizures responsive to treatment with vitamin B6 available as pyridoxine (PN) or as the biologically active form pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP). The vitamin B6-dependent epilepsies are caused by mutations in at least five different genes involved in B6 metabolism. A literature review revealed that only 30 patients with vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy caused by PLPBP mutation have been reported worldwide. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of baby boy born to first-cousin Pakistani parents who presented with generalized as well as focal seizures starting a few hours after birth and responsive to PLP. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant NM_007198.4:c.46_47insCA, NP_009129.1:p.Leu17Hisfs, causing a CA duplication resulting in a frameshift in the PLPBP gene. DISCUSSION: Vitamin B6-Dependent Epilepsy due to PLPBP defect is a rare disorder. The developmental outcomes are variable even with early therapy. Few patients are reported to achieve optimal developmental milestones with therapy. PLP has been advocated as the treatment of choice for PLPBP defect, but oral PN has also demonstrated good seizure control in some patients, including ours. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy due to PLPBP defect is an important differential diagnosis to consider in patients with biochemical features suggestive of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate Oxidase (PNPO) defect and gene testing can facilitate in reaching the correct diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment led to excellent seizure control in most patients."

      "abstract": "Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the active cofactor form of vitamin B6 is required by over 160 PLP-dependent (vitamin B6) enzymes serving diverse biological roles, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, hemes, and neurotransmitters metabolism. Three key enzymes, pyridoxal kinase (PL kinase), pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO), and phosphatases metabolize and supply PLP to PLP-dependent enzymes through the salvage pathway. In born errors in the salvage enzymes are known to cause inadequate levels of PLP in the cell, particularly in neuronal cells. The resulting PLP deficiency is known to cause or implicated in several pathologies, most notably seizures. One such disorder, PNPO-dependent neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (NEE) results from natural mutations in PNPO and leads to null or reduced enzymatic activity. NEE does not respond to conventional antiepileptic drugs but may respond to treatment with the B6 vitamers PLP and/or pyridoxine (PN). In born errors that lead to PLP deficiency in cells have also been reported in PL kinase, however, to date none has been associated with epilepsy or seizure. One such pathology is polyneuropathy that responds to PLP therapy. Phosphatase deficiency or hypophosphatasia disorder due to pathogenic mutations in alkaline phosphatase is known to cause seizures that respond to PN therapy. In this article, we review the biochemical features of in born errors pertaining to the salvage enzyme's deficiency that leads to NEE and other pathologies. We also present perspective on vitamin B6 treatment for these disorders, along with attempts to develop zebrafish model to study the NEE syndrome in vivo.",

      "abstract": "Pathological neovascularization in the eye is a leading cause of blindness in all age groups from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in children to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the elderly. Inhibiting neovascularization via antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs has been used for the effective treatment. However, anti-VEGF therapies may cause development of chorioretinal atrophy as they affect a physiological amount of VEGF essential for retinal homeostasis. Furthermore, anti-VEGF therapies are still ineffective in some cases, especially in patients with AMD. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a strong regulator of VEGF induction under hypoxic and other stress conditions. Our previous reports have indicated that HIF is associated with pathological retinal neovascularization in murine models of ROP and AMD, and HIF inhibition suppresses neovascularization by reducing an abnormal increase in VEGF expression. Along with this, we attempted to find novel effective HIF inhibitors from natural foods of our daily lives. Food ingredients were screened for prospective HIF inhibitors in ocular cell lines of 661W and ARPE-19, and a murine AMD model was utilized for examining suppressive effects of the ingredients on retinal neovascularization. As a result, rice bran and its component, vitamin B6 showed inhibitory effects on HIF activation and suppressed VEGF mRNA induction under a CoCl2-induced pseudo-hypoxic condition. Dietary supplement of these significantly suppressed retinal neovascularization in the AMD model. These data suggest that rice bran could have promising therapeutic values in the management of pathological ocular neovascularization.",

The mechanism by which combining magnesium and vitamin B6 leads to reduced stress in these subjects remains to be elucidated. This secondary analysis investigated the impact of magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation and perceived stress on erythrocyte magnesium levels, as a marker of body magnesium status. This was a secondary analysis from an 8-week randomized controlled trial comparing oral magnesium (300 mg) and magnesium-vitamin B6 (300 mg + 30 mg) supplementation. Stress level and erythrocyte magnesium level at baseline, and change in erythrocyte magnesium and serum vitamin B6 levels at weeks 4 and 8, were analyzed. Overall, 264 subjects were randomized to treatment and had evaluable Depression Anxiety Stress Scale scores (132 in each treatment arm). At baseline, stress scores, and mean serum magnesium, erythrocyte magnesium, and serum vitamin B6 concentrations were similar between arms. Although not significant between groups, a significant increase over time in erythrocyte magnesium levels was observed in the subgroup of subjects with low baseline erythrocyte magnesium levels (<1.6 mmol/L) following treatment with magnesium and magnesium-vitamin B6 (week 4:0.21 mmol/L [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.10 to 0.31], p = 0.0003; and 0.13 mmol/L [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.23], p = 0.0233, respectively). Change from baseline in circulating vitamin B6 levels at weeks 4 and 8 in the magnesium-vitamin B6 supplemented group (314.96 nmol/L [95%CI, 294.61 to 335.31]) was significantly different (p < 0.0001) compared with the magnesium supplemented group (-0.39 nmol/L [95% CI, -20.73 to 19.94]). Magnesium alone and magnesium-vitamin B6 provided statistically significant increases in erythrocyte magnesium in subjects with low magnesium status (<1.6mmol/L). Vitamin B6 supplementation did not further increase magnesium levels.",

A VISIA facial imaging system for the evaluation of erythema, superficial lipid level, and roughness of skin surface and a CK analyzer for biophysical parameters, including the stratum corneum hydration, facial surface lipid, and trans-epidermal water loss, were applied. Erythema was significantly reduced after every treatment (weeks 2, 4, and 6; P < 0.05), whereas superficial lipid level was not improved significantly until week 6 (P < 0.05), and roughness of the skin surface was not improved significantly during the whole treatment. The stratum corneum hydration of lesional skin was significantly increased after three times of treatment (P < 0.05). No observable adverse effect, such as marked erythema, blistering, or atrophy, was observed. Sequential transdermal delivery of small molecular weight drugs (vitamin B6, glycyrrhizin compound, metronidazole, and hyaluronic acid) using NTJI is a safe, low-toxicity, and take-home drug-free therapy for the treatment of FSD."

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study of vitamin B6 plasma levels in 24 patients with PD treated with L-DOPA/CD for 3 or more years, orally or intraduodenally. Vitamin B6 levels in plasma were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: All patients treated with intraduodenal L-DOPA/CD (6 of 6) and 13 of 18 patients receiving L-DOPA/CD orally had low plasma levels of vitamin B6. Eight of the 19 patients with low vitamin B6 levels had symptoms of hypovitaminosis B6. Patients with low vitamin B6 had been treated with larger doses of L-DOPA/CD, although the differences did not have statistical significance. Patients treated with intraduodenal L-DOPA/CD have vitamin B6 levels significantly lower than those treated with oral L-DOPA/CD. The variables that most correlated with vitamin B6 levels were the cumulative annual doses of CD (r = -0.36) and L-DOPA (r = -0.33) during the year preceding the study and the time to develop dyskinesias or fluctuations (r = +0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B6 could play an important role in PD and its levels seem to be influenced by L-DOPA/CD. Plasma vitamin B6 levels should be monitored in patients receiving high L-DOPA/CD doses, especially those treated with intraduodenal infusion.",

Circulatory homeostasis restoration is the mainstay of the therapeutic approach to TC, but the effects are significantly inhibited by coagulopathy. OBJECTIVE: To identify the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism of compound amino acid (CAA) combined with high-dosage of vitamin B6 (VB6) on TC. METHODS: Rabbit traumatic model and cellular model were used to evaluate the effect of CAA combined with high-dosage of VB6 in TC. Blood concentrations of AST and ALT were measured using the Vitros 250 device while blood APTT, PT and TT concentrations were measured using commercial diagnostics kits. Furthermore, qRT-PCR, ELISA and Western blotting were used to determine the expression of clotting factor (II, VII, IX, X and XI), inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) and HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB signaling-related proteins, respectively. RESULTS: In the rabbit traumatic model, CAA combined with high-dosage of VB6 therapy inhibited the high expression of AST and ALT, but increased the expression of coagulation factors. Additionally, in both the rabbit trauma model and cellular injury model, CAA combined with high-dosage of VB6 inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β) and proteins (HMGB1, TLR4 and p-p65) in HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Most importantly, over-expression of HMGB1 reversed the effect of CAA and VB6 in HUVECs and EA.hy926 cells injury model. CONCLUSION: CAA combined with high-dosage of VB6 alleviated TC and inhibited the expression and secretion of inflammatory factors by inhibiting HMGB1-mediated TLR4/NF-κB pathway."

However, its exact clinical efficacy and safety is still not well investigated. In this study, we aimed to summarize the efficacy of SC/VB6 injection on survival, liver function, immune function, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with HCC through the meta-analysis. METHODS: All available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and high-quality prospective cohort studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of SC/VB6 for patients with HCC were searched from ten electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Excerpt Medica Database (Embase), Medline, Web of Science (WOS), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Scientific Journal Database (CSJ), and Wanfang Database. Papers in Chinese or English published from January 2000 to July 2020 will be included without any restrictions.Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by 2 researchers. The clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS), QoL, liver function, immune function, and adverse events, were systematically evaluated. Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 14.0 were used for data analysis, and the quality of the clinical trials was also evaluated. RESULTS: The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and provide a helpful evidence for clinicians to formulate the best postoperative adjuvant treatment strategy for HCC patients. CONCLUSION: Our study will draw an objective conclusion of the efficacy of SC/VB6 on survival, liver function, immune function, and QoL in patients with HCC.

      "abstract": "PDXK encodes for a pyridoxal kinase, which converts inactive B6 vitamers to the active cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Recently, biallelic pathogenic variants in PDXK were shown to cause axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with optic atrophy that responds to PLP supplementation. We present two affected siblings carrying a novel biallelic missense PDXK variant with a similar phenotype with earlier onset. After detection of a novel PDXK variant using Whole Exome Sequencing, we confirmed pathogenicity through in silico protein structure analysis, determination of pyridoxal kinase activity using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and measurement of plasma PLP concentrations using high performance liquid chromatography. Our in silico analysis shows a potential effect on PDXK dimer stability, as well as a putative effect on posttranslational ubiquitination that is predicted to lead to increased protein degradation. We demonstrate that the variant leads to almost complete loss of PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP levels. Our patients' early diagnosis and prompt PLP replacement restored the PLP plasma levels, enabling long-term monitoring of clinical outcomes. We recommend that patients presenting with similar phenotype should be screened for PDXK mutations, as this is a rare opportunity for treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glaucoma is a multifactorial optic neuropathy, which causes a continuous loss of retinal ganglion cells. Given the neurodegenerative nature of glaucoma, the necessity for neuroprotective intervention still arises, to be added alongside hypotonic therapy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of daily intake of a homotaurine, carnosine, forskolin, vitamins B1, B2, and B6, folic acid, and magnesium based supplement (GANGLIOLIFE®) on the progression rates of the visual field in patients with progressive POAG despite good tonometric compensation and to assess the most suitable dosage. METHODS: This is a monocentric nonrandomized experimental clinical study. Patients with mean deviation (MD) ranging from -2 dB to -15 dB with MD progression ≥1 dB in the previous year and IOP values of ≤18 mm Hg were included. All the patients underwent supplement therapy for a period of 6 months. For the first 2 months, they took 2 tablets a day, and for the following 4 months, 1 tablet a day. The patients were assessed before the start of treatment, time 0 (T 0), after 2 months (T 1), and after 6 months (T 2) of therapy. At each check-up, patients were given a full eye test including perimetry, RNFL, and GCC using FD-OCT, PERG, contrast sensitivity, and QoL evaluation using the Glaucoma Symptom Scale questionnaire and National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25. RESULTS: 31 patients with a mean age of 70.80 ± 8.77 were included. At T 1 and T 2, the mean values of MD were lessened (MD = -5.37 ± -2.91, P < 0.01, and MD = -5.48 ± 3.15, P < 0.05, respectively) compared to T 0 (MD = -5.98 ± 2.83). Patients also demonstrated a significant reduction in IOP (P < 0.01), improved light sensitivity (P < 0.01) and contrast sensitivity (P < 0.05), and a better quality of life (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a supplement which includes homotaurine, carnosine, forskolin, vitamins B1, B2, and B6, folic acid, and magnesium has been shown to be able to slow down the rate of progression of functional damage and improve visual function after 2 and 6 months of daily intake. Quality of life showed significant improvement."

Herein, water-soluble vitamin B6 with pKa (5.6) was chemically conjugated to lipid-soluble vitamin E succinate (α-TOS), which showed selective cancer cell killing ability and this amphiphilic small molecule vitamin conjugate could self-assemble to be free nanoparticles (NPs) and doxorubicin-loaded NPs (α-TOS-B6-NPs-DOX). The small molecule nanodrugs could perform the following characteristic: (i) stability in the sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) solution and long-term storage stability in PBS via surface negative charge; (ii) tumor accumulation by enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effect; (iii) improved cellular internalization by means of vitamin B6 transporting membrane carrier (VTC); and (iv) facilitating endosomal escape and rapid drug release for synergistic toxicity to tumor cells via charge reversal and ester hydrolysis at intracellular pH and/or esterase. Moreover, α-TOS-B6-NPs-DOX exhibited long blood circulation stability and significant tumor accumulation and inhibition with the decreased side effects in vivo. Thus, the pH-sensitive small molecule nanodrug self-assembled from amphiphilic vitamin B6-E analogue conjugate could be the potential drug carriers in targeted synergistic cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase is a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme that degrades sphingosine-1-phosphate in the final step of sphingolipid metabolism. In 2017, a new inherited disorder was described caused by mutations in SGPL1, which encodes sphingosine phosphate lyase (SPL). This condition is referred to as SPL insufficiency syndrome (SPLIS) or alternatively as nephrotic syndrome type 14 (NPHS14). Patients with SPLIS exhibit lymphopenia, nephrosis, adrenal insufficiency, and/or neurological defects. No targeted therapy for SPLIS has been reported. Vitamin B6 supplementation has therapeutic activity in some genetic diseases involving B6-dependent enzymes, a finding ascribed largely to the vitamin's chaperone function. We investigated whether B6 supplementation might have activity in SPLIS patients. We retrospectively monitored responses of disease biomarkers in patients supplemented with B6 and measured SPL activity and sphingolipids in B6-treated patient-derived fibroblasts. In two patients, disease biomarkers responded to B6 supplementation. S1P abundance and activity levels increased and sphingolipids decreased in response to B6. One responsive patient is homozygous for an SPL R222Q variant present in almost 30% of SPLIS patients. Molecular modeling suggests the variant distorts the dimer interface which could be overcome by cofactor supplementation. We demonstrate the first potential targeted therapy for SPLIS and suggest that 30% of SPLIS patients might respond to cofactor supplementation.",

The in silico analysis of gene expression data of psoriasis lesional skin and an analysis of vitamin B6 metabolites in the sera of psoriasis patients point to altered vitamin B6 metabolism at both local and systemic levels. Functional studies showed that vitamin B6 vitamers reduced skin neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress and Nfkb activity in two zebrafish models of skin inflammation. Strikingly, inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase L (Pygl) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd), two vitamin B6-regulated enzymes, alleviated oxidative-stress induced inflammation in zebrafish skin inflammation models. Despite the central role of G6pd in antioxidant defenses, the results of the study demonstrate that glycogen stores and G6pd fuel NADPH oxidase to promote skin inflammation, revealing novel targets for the treatment of skin inflammatory disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nausea and vomiting (NV) affect up to 85% of pregnant women, which has multiple effects on pregnancy outcome. The truth etiology of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) is still unknown. Considering the potential teratogenic effect in fetus due to chemical drugs, ginger can be used to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Reports have shown that ginger can reduce the severity of NV, however, these results are controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to explore the effect of ginger in the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy compared with placebo and vitamin B6. METHODS: The randomized control trials (RCTs) on the association with ginger and pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting were searched and identified in two databases Web of Science and PubMed (up to April 2019). Stata software was used to conduct meta-analysis. In addition, the source of heterogeneity explored by metaregression, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analyses, the publication bias were assessed by Egger's tests and Funnel plot, p < .05 was considered to be significant. RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 1174 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The result demonstrated that ginger intervention has significant effect in improving general symptom of NVP [OR = 7.475, 95% CI = (4.133, 13.520), I2 = 30.1%], relieving severity of nausea [SMD = 0.821, 95% CI = (0.585, 1.056), I2 = 38.9%], but not significant in reducing vomiting [SMD = 0.549, 95% CI = (-0.268, 1.365), I2 = 91.4%], compared with placebo. Besides, ginger intervention has no significant effect on improving general symptom of NVP [OR = 1.239, 95% CI = (0.495, 3.102), I2 = 57.3%], relieving severity of nausea [SMD = 0.199, 95% CI = (-0.102, 0.500), I2 = 65.7%], reducing vomiting [SMD = 0.331, 95% CI = (-0.145, 0.808), I2 = 85.9%], compared with vitamin B6. CONCLUSIONS: Ginger supplementation significantly relieve general NVP symptom and nausea compared with placebo, but no significant effect on vomiting. Moreover, ginger is more effective than vitamin B6 in treating NVP, although, there were no significant differences. Further, rigidly designed RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed to verify the effectiveness of ginger supplementation for treatment NVP compared with vitamin B6.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects 20%-30% of women but current medical treatments are limited in their efficacy. The objective of this study was to compare efficacy of a broad-spectrum micronutrient formula (consisting mainly of minerals and vitamins) to a single vitamin (B6) for treatment of PMS, for which B6 has already been shown to be efficacious. Methods: This double-blind, randomized, treatment-controlled trial allocated 78 (72 completed) regularly menstruating women with PMS to consume micronutrients or vitamin B6 (80 mg/day) daily following a two-cycle baseline period, for three menstrual cycles. The primary outcome measure, Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), established PMS as well as tracked change in five PMS symptoms: psychological, somatic, total symptoms, impact ratings, and worst day ratings. Results: Linear-mixed model analyses indicated both treatments produced comparable reduction in PMS symptoms with medium effect sizes (ES) across all PMS variables as measured by the DRSP (micronutrient ES = 0.50-0.56; B6 ES = 0.43-0.56), with 72% of the micronutrient and 60% of the vitamin B6 group identified as in full remission in PMS symptoms after three cycles. The micronutrient-treated participants showed greater improvement than the B6 group (between group d = 0.51, p < 0.05) in health-related quality of life. For those women (n = 28) who met criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), the DRSP ES were larger for those who had been in the micronutrient condition (ES = 1.28-1.67) as compared with those on B6 (ES = 0.50-0.75), although the group differences were not statistically reliable. There were no group differences in side effects, nor any serious adverse effects reported. Conclusions: Both treatments provided similar benefit for reducing PMS symptoms, with greater effect of micronutrients on quality of life as well as potential clinical benefit of micronutrients for PMDD. This study provides further efficacy data on B6 and also identifies the nutritionally broader spectrum intervention as possibly having specific advantages for those whose symptoms are more severe. As this is the first study to investigate these treatments for PMDD, systematic replication is required.",

The etiology and pathogenesis of CF is unknown, and lack of biomarkers hampers development of diagnostic tests and successful therapy. Recent studies on the changes of amino acid levels and other metabolites in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalopathy (CFS/ME) have pointed to possible central defects in energy metabolism. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of serum concentrations of amino acids, including metabolites of tryptophan, the kynurenine pathway and vitamin B6 in a well characterized national Norwegian cohort of lymphoma survivors after high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Among the 20 standard amino acids in humans, only tryptophan levels were significantly lower in both males and females with CF compared to non-fatigued survivors, a strikingly different pattern than seen in CFS/ME. Markers of tryptophan degradation by the kynurenine pathway (kynurenine/tryptophan ratio) and activation of vitamin B6 catabolism (pyridoxic acid/(pyridoxal + pyridoxal 5'-phosphate), PAr index) differed in survivors with or without CF and correlated with known markers of immune activation and inflammation, such as neopterin, C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6. Among personal traits and clinical findings assessed simultaneously in participating survivors, higher neuroticism score, obesity and higher PAr index were significantly associated with increased risk of CF. Collectively, these data point to low grade immune activation and inflammation as a basis for CF in lymphoma survivors.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Vitamin B6-responsive epilepsies are a group of genetic disorders including ALDH7A1 deficiency, PNPO deficiency, and others, usually causing neonatal onset seizures resistant to treatment with common antiepileptic drugs. Recently, biallelic mutations in PLPBP were shown to be a novel cause of vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy with a variable phenotype. The different vitamin B6-responsive epilepsies can be detected and distinguished by their respective biomarkers and genetic analysis. Unfortunately, metabolic biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of PLPBP deficiency are currently still lacking. Here, we present data from two further patients with vitamin B6-dependent seizures caused by variants in PLPBP, including a novel missense variant, and compare their genotype and phenotypic presentation to previously described cases. Hyperglycinemia and hyperlactatemia are the most consistently observed biochemical abnormalities in pyridoxal phosphate homeostasis protein (PLPHP) deficient patients and were present in both patients in this report within the first days of life. Lactic acidemia, the neuroradiological, and clinical presentation led to misdiagnosis of a mitochondrial encephalopathy in two previously published cases with an early fatal course. Similarly, on the background of glycine elevation in plasma, glycine encephalopathy was wrongly adopted as diagnosis for a patient in our report. In this regard, lactic acidemia as well as hyperglycinemia appear to be diagnostic pitfalls in patients with vitamin B6-responsive epilepsies, including PLPHP deficiency. SYNOPSIS: In vitamin B6-responsive epilepsies, including PLPHP deficiency, there are several diagnostic pitfalls, including lactic acidemia as well as hyperglycinemia, highlighting the importance of a pyridoxine trial, and genetic testing."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress performs an imperative role in the onset and progression of diabetes. Metabolic enzymes and cellular organelles are detrimental to increased levels of free radicals and the subsequent reduction in anti-oxidant defence. Pyridoxamine (vitamin B6) is an indispensible nutrient for humans and is considered to be an important food additive too. The aim of this research was to examine the effect of vitamin B6 in a diabetic environment. This study reports the effects of pyridoxamine supplementation in alloxan induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by the single intra peritoneal dose of alloxan (120 mg per kg body weight). Diabetic rats were treated with pyridoxamine (10 and 15 mg per kg body weight) and compared with a control set of diabetic rats without supplementation. Pyridoxamine treatment showed dose dependent recovery in all parameters. A notable decline in oxidative stress parameters and ROS production with reductions in fasting blood glucose levels along with normal patterns of the glucose tolerance test has been reported here. Histological studies reveal damage recovery in the liver as well as kidney tissues. A notable amount of recovery was observed in cellular DNA distortion and damage. It is thus advocated that pyridoxamine might help in reducing problems associated with diabetes. A probable mechanism pertaining to the action of pyridoxamine is proposed as well."

A good agreement between the computed and experimental infrared frequencies demonstrates validity of the optimized geometry for the synthesized complex. In a N2 O2 manner, two azomethine nitrogens and two phenolate oxygens of the L2- ligand are coordinated to the Mn2+ metal ion. The biological studies indicate an efficient apoptotic and antioxidant activities of the synthesized [MnL(CH3 OH)2 ] complex on both of the HepG2 and MCF7 cancer cells.

We recently reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence PNPO expression in the brain are associated with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). However, it is not known whether any of these GGE-associated SNPs influence vitamin B6 metabolite levels. Such an influence would suggest that vitamin B6 could play a role in GGE therapy. Here, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to assess the influence of GGE associated genetic variants on measures of vitamin B6 metabolism in blood plasma in 2232 healthy individuals. We also asked if SNPs that influence vitamin B6 were associated with GGE in 3122 affected individuals and 20,244 controls. Our GWAS of vitamin B6 metabolites reproduced a previous association and found a novel genome-wide significant locus. The SNPs in these loci were not associated with GGE. We found that 84 GGE-associated SNPs influence expression levels of PNPO in the brain as well as in blood. However, these SNPs were not associated with vitamin B6 metabolism in plasma. By leveraging polygenic risk scoring (PRS), we found suggestive evidence of higher catabolism and lower levels of the active and transport forms of vitamin B6 in GGE, although these findings require further replication."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the main complaints in pediatric neurology. Exogenous melatonin has been shown to be useful and safe in improving sleep-wake cycles and sleep quality in children. Tryptophan as well plays a key role in sleep regulation. So far, no studies tried to analyze the effects of a combination of both melatonin and tryptophan in treating chronic headache in children affected also by night-time awakenings. METHODS: Thirty-four children with a diagnosis of chronic headache (with or without sleep disorders) have been enrolled. The study was articulated in two steps: 1) each child was observed for one month without any intervention; 2) children have been then randomized into two groups: the \"ME-group\", which received the nutritional supplement melatonin for two months and the \"MET-group\", which received the nutritional supplements melatonin, tryptophan, and vitamin B6 for two months. RESULTS: In terms of changes in number of headache events, responders in the ME-group were 91.7% and those in the MET-group were 66.7% (P=0.113). In terms of changes in number of night awakenings, in the ME group, mean number at baseline, after 30 days, and after 60 days were 3.6±3.2, 3.2±3.5, and 2.7±3.4 (P=0.495). In the MET group, mean number of night awakenings was 7.4±8.1, 4.0±4.4, and 3.3±2.9 (P=0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Using either nutritional supplement for two months can help in decreasing the monthly number of headache episodes and night awakenings. The addition of tryptophan and vitamin B6 appears to have stronger influence on night awakenings reduction than melatonin only.",

Areas covered: A critical review was conducted on the therapeutic management of all the reported patients with genetically confirmed diagnoses of diseases affecting vitamin B6 metabolism and presenting with pyridoxine or pyridoxal-5I-phosphate dependent-seizures. Data about safety and efficacy were analyzed as well as the management of supplementation with pyridoxine or pyridoxal-5I-phosphate both in the acute phases and in the maintenance therapies. The authors also analyzed alternative therapeutic strategies for ALDH7A1 deficiency (lysine-restricted diet, arginine supplementation, oligonucleotide antisense therapy, upstream inhibition of aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase). Expert opinion: The administration of pyridoxine or pyridoxal-5I-phosphate should be considered in all intractable seizures also beyond the first year of life. Lysine restricted diet and arginine supplementation should be introduced in all the confirmed ALDH7A1 deficient patients. Pre or post-natal supplementation with pyridoxine should be given in familial cases until an eventual molecular genetic disconfirmation. Minor data about alternative therapies are available for other disorders of vitamin B6 metabolism.",

This study investigated the effect of a combination of melatonin, vitamin B6 and medicinal plants in patients with mild-to-moderate sleep disorders. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a 4-week, single-center, single-arm, open-label study conducted in 40 participants with mild-to-moderate insomnia, in Poland. INTERVENTION: Participants received Novanuit® Triple Action (melatonin, vitamin B6, California poppy extract, passionflower extract, and lemon balm extract) capsules per day for two weeks. OUTCOMES: Using a daily electronic sleep diary, information was collected on sleep quality (assessed on a 0-10 scale), total sleep duration, sleep onset latency, sleep-related daytime impairment, and safety of the study medication. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant (p < 0.001) improvement in sleep quality by the end of the 2-week treatment period, with mean sleep quality score increasing by 1.9 points from pre-treatment (5.4 points) to post-treatment (7.3 points). Similarly, statistically significant improvements were observed following treatment completion in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, and sleep-related daytime parameters (p < 0.01 for all outcomes). Administration of the combination of melatonin, vitamin B6, and medicinal plants was associated with high compliance (39/40; 97.5%). No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that the combination of melatonin, vitamin B6, and medicinal plants may be beneficial in mild-to-moderate insomnia.",

This study investigated the relationship between vitamin B6 intake and the incidence of diabetic retinopathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The study was part of an examination of a nationwide cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes aged 40-70 years with HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol. After excluding nonresponders to a dietary survey using the Food Frequency Questionnaire based on food groups, 978 patients were analyzed. Primary outcome was the 8-year risk of a diabetic retinopathy event, and Cox regression analyses estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for retinopathy according to vitamin B6 intake adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, HbA1c, smoking, energy intake, and other confounders. RESULTS: Mean vitamin B6 intake in quartiles ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 mg/day, and half of the participants had vitamin B6 intake below the recommended daily dietary allowance according to dietary reference intakes in Japanese adults (men 1.4 mg/day; women 1.2 mg/day). After adjusting for confounders, HRs for diabetic retinopathy in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartile groups of vitamin B6 intake compared with the 1st quartile group were 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.81-1.69, p = 0.403), 0.88 (0.58-1.34, p = 0.550), and 0.50 (0.30-0.85, p = 0.010), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested that high vitamin B6 intake was associated with a lower incidence of diabetic retinopathy in Japanese with type 2 diabetes.",

METHODS: We included in the present study 48 patients with uncomplicated nephrolithiasis, with the maximum calculi diameter of up to 15 mm, confirmed by non-contrast-enhanced computer tomography. Each patient followed a three-month therapeutic regimen with the above mentioned combination, with imaging assessment of the calculi after treatment. RESULTS: Per patient: The mean age of the patients was 48 years. The median number of calculi was 1 and the mean dimension was 5.5 mm. The stone-free status after treatment was not correlated with gender (p=0.7), side location (p=0.8) or with the number of calculi (p=0.3), but we found a correlation with the location in the upper or middle calyx (54.5% vs 13.8%, p=0.008) and with the maximum diameter (p=0.001).Per stone: 60 calculi were analyzed, 8.3% being located in the upper calyx, 36.7% in the middle and 55% in the lower one. After treatment, 40% were absent, 21.7% showed lower dimensions and 38.3% remained unchanged, with the mean reduction of 1.7 mm. We identified a cut-off value of ≤ 3 mm (AUC 0.9, CI:0.8-0.9, p<0.0001) for the prediction of stone-free status after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The current treatment had the highest efficacy in achieving stone-free status for patients with calculi ≤ 3 mm, located in the middle or upper calyx. A higher duration of the treatment might show improved results."

HPP is characterized by defective bone mineralization. It frequently accompanies pyridoxine-responsive seizures. Because alkaline phosphatase change pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP) into pyridoxal (PL), which can cross the blood brain barrier and regulates inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. The female patient was born at a gestational age of 37 weeks 2 days. She presented severe respiratory disorder due to extreme thoracic hypoplasia. With the extremely low serum ALP value (14 IU/L), she was clinically diagnosed as HPP. The diagnosis was confirmed with genetic testing. On day1, the subclinical seizures were detected by aEEG. Together with enzyme replacement therapy by asfotase alfa, pyridoxine hydrochloride was administered, then the seizures were rapidly controlled. While confirming that there was no seizure by aEEG monitoring, pyridoxine hydrochloride was gradually discontinued after 1 month. Before administration of pyridoxine hydrochloride, PL was extremely low (4.7 nM) and PLP was increased (1083 nM). After the withdrawal, PL was increased to 84.9 nM only by enzyme replacement. Monitoring with aEEG enabled early intervention for pyridoxine responsive seizures. Confirming increased serum PL concentration is a prudent step in determining when to reduce or discontinue pyridoxine hydrochloride during enzyme replacement therapy.",

This meta-analysis aimed to provide evidence-based medical data for clinical treatment with DCVB6 injection. METHODS: We searched 7 medical databases up to January 2018 for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) based on DCVB6 injection combined with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. A manual search in relevant journals and of relevant literature on other websites was also performed. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Subsequently, a meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. The PROSPERO ID was CRD42018086377. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCTs were included. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the DCVB6 injection combined with chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone regarding objective response rate (RR=1.58, 95% CI 1.40-1.79), Karnofsky performance score (RR=1.68, 95% CI 1.42-1.99), clinical symptom (RR=1.68, 95% CI 1.44-1.96), white blood cell toxicity (RR=0.36, 95% CI 0.27-0.49), platelet toxicity (RR=0.46, 95% CI 0.33-0.63), and vomiting (RR=0.50, 95% CI 0.37-0.67). CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that DCVB6 injection combined with chemotherapy could increase objective response rate and Karnofsky performance score, improve clinical symptoms, and reduce side effects caused by chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. However, these results should be carefully interpreted due to the low-quality methodology and the small sample sizes of the trials, and our conclusions should be verified by high-quality, large-scale, double-blinded RCTs."

We hypothesized that supplementation with BCAA and vitamin B6 would result in more weight loss and improve body composition and blood markers related to cardiovascular diseases. Our aim was to determine whether the mentioned supplementation would affect weight loss, body composition, and cardiovascular risk factors during weight loss intervention. To this end, we performed a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in 42 overweight and obese women (BMI = 25-34.9 kg/m2). Taking a four-week moderate deficit calorie diet (-500 kcal/day), participants were randomized to receive BCAA (6 g/day) with vitamin B6 (40 mg/day) or placebo. Body composition variables measured with the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis, homeostatic model assessment, and plasma insulin, Low density lipoprotein, High density lipoprotein, Total Cholesterol, Triglyceride, and fasting blood sugar were measured. The result indicated that, weight loss was not significantly affected by BCAA and vitamin B6 supplementation (-2.43 ± 1.02 kg) or placebo (-1.64 ± 1.48 kg). However, significant time × treatment interactions in waist to hip ratio (P = 0.005), left leg lean (P = 0.004) and right leg lean (P = 0.023) were observed.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of sodium cantharidinate and vitamin B6 (SC/B6) combined with conventional medical treatment (CMT) for the treatment of patients with advanced digestive system neoplasms (DSNs). METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were searched for clinical trials using SC/B6 for DSNs. Outcome measures, including therapeutic efficacy, quality of life (QoL), and adverse events, were extracted and systematically evaluated. RESULTS: Data from 24 trials including 1,825 advanced DSN patients were included. Compared with CMT alone, its combination with SC/B6 significantly improved the patients' overall response rate (OR =2.25, 95% CI =1.83-2.76, P<0.00001), disease control rate (OR =2.41, 95% CI =1.85-3.15, P<0.00001), and QoL improvement rate (OR =2.75, 95% CI =2.13-3.55, P<0.00001). Moreover, adverse events caused by chemotherapy, including leukopenia, nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal side effects, hepatotoxicity, diarrhea, transaminase disorder, myelosuppression, anorexia, and anemia, were significantly alleviated (P<0.05) when SC/B6 was applied to DSN patients. Nephrotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, hand-foot syndrome, and oral mucositis were not significantly alleviated in patients receiving combination therapy (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of SC/B6 and CMT is more effective in treating DSNs than CMT alone. This combination alleviates the adverse effects associated with chemotherapy and improves the QoL of DSN patients, and its application in the clinic is worth promoting.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Animal and clinical studies suggest complementary effects of magnesium and high-dose pyridoxine (vitamin B6) on stress reduction. This is the first randomized trial evaluating the effects of combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation on stress in a stressed population with low magnesemia using a validated measure of perceived stress. METHODS: In this Phase IV, investigator-blinded trial (EudraCT: 2015-003749-24), healthy adults with Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42) stress subscale score >18 and serum magnesium concentration 0.45 mmol/L-0.85 mmol/L, were randomized 1:1 to magnesium-vitamin B6 combination (Magne B6 [Mg-vitamin B6]; daily dose 300 mg and 30 mg, respectively) or magnesium alone (Magnespasmyl [Mg]; daily dose 300 mg). Outcomes included change in DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (primary endpoint) and Week 4, and incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: In the modified intention-to-treat analysis (N = 264 subjects), both treatment arms substantially reduced DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (Mg-vitamin B6, 44.9%; Mg 42.4%); no statistical difference between arms was observed (p>0.05). An interaction (p = 0.0097) between baseline stress level and treatment warranted subgroup analysis (as per statistical plan); adults with severe/extremely severe stress (DASS-42 stress subscale score ≥25; N = 162) had a 24% greater improvement with Mg-vitamin B6 versus Mg at Week 8 (3.16 points, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.82, p = 0.0203). Consistent results were observed in the per protocol analysis and at Week 4. Overall, 12.1% of Mg-vitamin B6 treated and 17.4% of Mg-treated subjects experienced AEs potentially treatment related. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest oral Mg supplementation alleviated stress in healthy adults with low magnesemia and the addition of vitamin B6 to Mg was not superior to Mg supplementation alone. With regard to subjects with severe/extremely severe stress, this study provides clinical support for greater benefit of Mg combined with vitamin B6.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of calcium and vitamin B6 therapies on urinary oxalate excretion in a rodent model of enteric hyperoxaluria after Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. METHODS: Obese male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham (n = 7) or RYGB (n = 10). Animals were maintained on low oxalate (1.5%) and fat (10%; LOF), normal calcium (0.6 %) diet for 8 weeks and then completed a 2-phase crossover metabolic study. In the first 2-week phase, animals were fed a Low oxalate and fat (LOF), high calcium (2.4%; HC) diet. After a 2-week washout, rats were fed a LOF/normal calcium diet highly enriched with vitamin B6. Urine was collected before and after each intervention. Plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and metabolites were measured baseline and 11 weeks after sham or RYGB. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, sham animals on LOF/HC diet doubled their urinary calcium excretion but not oxalate. RYGB animals on LOF/HC diet decreased urinary oxalate excretion 28% (P = .001) without a significant rise in urinary calcium. Vitamin B6 supplementation decreased RYGB urinary oxalate by approximately 15% (P = .06), and serum PLP explained 63% of urinary oxalate variability. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings in this model, calcium supplementation appears to be a reasonable therapy to decrease urinary oxalate in RYGB patients who maintain a low fat and oxalate diet. Serum PLP had a fair correlation to urinary oxalate excretion and may be a useful screening tool in hyperoxaluric RYGB patients. Further experimental human studies after RYGB are necessary to determine whether these commonly employed supplements truly provide a benefit in enteric hyperoxaluria.",

We analyzed the existing data from our intervention study with 17 persons. First, we focused on signs and biomarkers that have been identified as candidates for vitamin B6 responsiveness indicators. Second, we conducted hypothesis testing among these selected variables and their combinations. Finally, we further investigated the results by conducting cluster analyses with two different algorithms, affinity propagation and k-medoids. Statistically significant variables for vitamin B6 responsiveness, including combination of hypersensitivity to sound and clumsiness, and plasma glutamine level, were included. As an a priori variable, the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS) scores was also included. The affinity propagation analysis showed good classification of three potential vitamin B6-responsive persons with ASD. The k-medoids analysis also showed good classification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to attempt to identify subgroup of persons with ASD who show specific treatment responsiveness using selected phenotype variables. We applied machine learning methods to further investigate these variables' ability to identify this subgroup of ASD, even when only a small sample size was available.",

      "abstract": "Growing evidence shows that improper intake of vitamin B6 increases cancer risk and several studies indicate that diabetic patients have a higher risk of developing tumors. We previously demonstrated that in Drosophila the deficiency of Pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, causes chromosome aberrations (CABs), one of cancer prerequisites, and increases hemolymph glucose content. Starting from these data we asked if it was possible to provide a link between the aforementioned studies. Thus, we tested the effect of low PLP levels on DNA integrity in diabetic cells. To this aim we generated two Drosophila models of type 2 diabetes, the first by impairing insulin signaling and the second by rearing flies in high sugar diet. We showed that glucose treatment induced CABs in diabetic individuals but not in controls. More interestingly, PLP deficiency caused high frequencies of CABs in both diabetic models demonstrating that hyperglycemia, combined to reduced PLP level, impairs DNA integrity. PLP-depleted diabetic cells accumulated Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) that largely contribute to CABs as α-lipoic acid, an AGE inhibitor, rescued not only AGEs but also CABs. These data, extrapolated to humans, indicate that low PLP levels, impacting on DNA integrity, may be considered one of the possible links between diabetes and cancer.",

A total of 134 patients receiving embolization of CA in the Central Hospital of Wuhan between February, 2013 and June, 2015 and were divided into observation and control groups according to the random number table method, with 67 cases in each group. The control was given vitamin B6 routine treatment, while the observation group received glycerol fructose on the basis of treatment in the control group. The incidence rate of postoperative complications after treatment, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, Barthel index score, and neurological fatigue index (NFI) score were compared between the two groups. After treatment, the GCS, Barthel index and NFI scores of patients in the observation were better than those in the control group (p<0.05), and the Barthel index score in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p<0.01). The mean flow velocity of middle cerebral artery (MCA) in the observation group after treatment was significantly different from that in the control group (p<0.05). As for complications, the incidence rates of postoperative cerebral vasospasm (1.49%), cerebral ischemia (1.49%), hematoma at puncture site (2.98%) and aneurysm rupture and hemorrhage (4.47%) in the observation group were lower than those of cerebral vasospasm (8.95%), cerebral ischemia (7.46%), hematoma at puncture site (8.95%) and aneurysm rupture and hemorrhage (10.44%) in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). In conclusion, glycerol fructose combined with vitamin B6 can reduce the incidence rate of postoperative complications and improve patients self-care ability and quality of life. Therefore, it is beneficial to postoperative recovery and it is worthy of clinical application."
