      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent evidence links diet and physical activity with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission, but emerging findings suggest that immune system dysregulation may play a crucial role. This study aimed to investigate the associations between neutrophils and T2DM remission. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of newly-diagnosed T2DM patients (N = 183) from the CORDIOPREV study, without glucose-lowering treatment, and were randomized to follow either a Mediterranean or low-fat diet. Patients were classified into two groups: Responders, who achieved T2DM remission (n = 73), and Non-Responders, who did not achieve remission during the 5-year dietary intervention (n = 110). Neutrophil count and their related-ratio (NER, NBR, NLR and NHR, normalized with erythrocytes, basophils, lymphocytes, and HDL respectively) were measured at the baseline and 5 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The lowest baseline tertile of neutrophil count was associated with an increased likelihood of T2DM remission among patients following a Mediterranean diet (but not for low-fat diet) when compared with the highest tertile [adjusted HR of 4.23 (95% CI: 1.53-11.69)], in which similar results were observed for NER and NHR. When considering clinical and neutrophil variables, the predictive capacity of this model yielded an AUC of 0.783 (95% CI: 0.680-0.822). Furthermore, after 5-years, Responders exhibited lower neutrophil count compared to Non-responders (p = 0.006) and a significant decrease in neutrophil count (p = 0.001) compared to baseline. This decrease in neutrophil count in Responders who consumed a Mediterranean diet exhibited a significant increase in Insulin Sensitivity and Disposition Index (p = 0.011 and p = 0.018) after the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that neutrophil count can help in identifying patients that are more likely to achieve T2DM remission following a Mediterranean diet, suggesting a role on insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Further research holds promise for providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of T2DM.

      "abstract": "Current pharmacologic treatments for atherosclerosis do not completely protect patients; additional protection can be achieved by dietary modifications, such as a low-cholesterol/low-fat diet (LCLFD), that mediate plaque stabilization and inflammation reduction. However, this lifestyle modification can be challenging for patients. Unfortunately, incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms has thwarted efforts to mimic the protective effects of a LCLFD. Here, we report that the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate itaconate (ITA), produced by plaque macrophages, is key to diet-induced plaque resolution. ITA is produced by immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1), which we observe is highly elevated in myeloid cells of vulnerable plaques and absent from early or stable plaques in mice and humans. We additionally report development of an ITA-conjugated lipid nanoparticle that accumulates in plaque and bone marrow myeloid cells, epigenetically reduces inflammation via H3K27ac deacetylation, and reproduces the therapeutic effects of LCLFD-induced plaque resolution in multiple atherosclerosis models.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotics are known to cause loose stools, disrupt the fecal microbiota, and alter fecal bile acid (BA) profiles of dogs. Recovery may be aided by diet, but little research has been conducted. The objective of this study was to determine how a veterinary low-fat diet affected the fecal characteristics, metabolites, BA, and microbiota of dogs receiving antibiotics. Twenty-four healthy adult dogs [7.38 ± 1.95 yr; 7.67 ± 0.76 kg body weight (BW)] were used in an 8-wk completely randomized design study. During a 2-wk baseline, all dogs were fed a leading grocery brand diet (GBD). Over the next 2 wk, dogs were fed GBD and received metronidazole orally (20 mg/kg BW twice daily). At week 4, dogs were randomly allotted to one of two treatments [GBD or Blue Buffalo Natural Veterinary Diet GI Gastrointestinal Support Low-Fat (BB)] and fed for 4 wk. Fecal scores were recorded daily and fresh fecal samples were collected at weeks 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 for measurement of pH, dry matter content, and metabolite and BA concentrations. Fecal microbiota populations were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR-based dysbiosis index (DI). All data were analyzed as repeated measures using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS 9.4, testing for effects of treatment, time, and treatment*time and significance set at P < 0.05. Metronidazole increased (P < 0.0001) fecal scores (looser stools), reduced fecal short-chain fatty acid, branched-chain fatty acid, phenol, and indole concentrations, increased primary BA concentrations, and decreased secondary BA concentrations. Metronidazole also reduced fecal bacterial alpha diversity, altered the abundance of 58 bacterial genera, and increased DI. During antibiotic recovery, changes in fecal pH, dry matter percentage, and metabolite and immunoglobulin A concentrations were altered (P < 0.05) by diet. Fecal BA concentrations recovered quickly for all dogs. Change in lithocholic acid was affected (P < 0.0001) by diet, but other BA were not. Recovery of over 25 bacterial genera was impacted by diet (P < 0.05). While many bacterial taxa returned to baseline levels after 4 wk, others did not fully recover. DI and bacterial alpha diversity measures recovered quickly for all dogs but were not impacted by diet. In conclusion, metronidazole drastically altered the fecal microbiota and metabolites of dogs. While most variables returned to baseline by week 8, diet may be used to aid in recovery.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: PubMed and other databases were searched for the full-text literature comparing LFD and LCD up to November 2023 using a subject plus free word strategy, with search terms such as \"low-fat diet\", \"low-carbohydrate diet\", \"obesity\", \"weight\", \"adolescents\", \"RCT\", and so on. Two independent reviewers selected promising candidate trials, collected the data, and assessed the quality of the trials. RevMan 5.3 software was utilized to conduct a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were included. RESULTS: 5 RCTs with 192 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Weight (mean difference -2.81; 95% CI -5.38 to -0.25), Body Mass Index (BMI) (-1.13; 95% CI -2.14 to -0.11) and Triglyceride (TG) (-0.36; 95% CI -0.46 to -0.27) of the LCD were significantly lower than that of the LFD. At the same time, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels of the LCD were significantly higher than those of the LFD (0.08; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12) (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), percent body fat, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: According to this study, LCD is more helpful in improving weight loss, HDL and TG. Thus, LCD may serve as an effective intervention for weight management in adolescents with overweight and obesity, although further research is needed to determine its long-term effects."

      "abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a leading cause of several chronic diseases, imposing a significant global economic burden. The Mediterranean diet (MD) and low-fat diet (LFD) are the two primary recommended dietary patterns that exhibit distinct positive effects on treating NAFLD. Objective: To investigate which of the two diets, MD and LFD, is more effective in the treatment of NAFLD. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to April 2024 were searched for in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Scopus and Embase. Interventions included MD or LFD, with primary outcome measures being intrahepatic lipid, liver stiffness, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Secondary outcomes included weight, waist circumference, and body mass index. Use of random effects meta-analysis to assess outcomes of interest. Results: meta-analysis revealed no significant differences between MD and LFD in improving liver enzymes, liver fat, and related indices in NAFLD patients. Our findings provide compelling evidence for patients and healthcare professionals, allowing patients to choose a dietary pattern that aligns with their preferences and disease conditions. In summary, both MD and LFD can equivalently ameliorate NAFLD in the short term. Conclusions: Our results show that MD and LFD have similar therapeutic effects on liver enzymes and liver fat content in patients with NAFLD in the short term. Furthermore, our meta-analysis results have also opened up a new avenue of thought as to whether similar effects are achieved by alternating MD and LFD on alternate days.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chylothorax is a postoperative complication in patients with lung cancer. Diet-control approaches have been the mainstay for managing this condition. However, a surgical intervention is needed for the patients if conservative treatment is ineffective. Because of the lack of accurate indicators to assess the prognosis of the postoperative complication at an early stage, the criteria of surgical treatment were not consistent. METHODS: We reviewed 2942 patients who underwent pulmonary resection and lymph node dissection for primary lung cancer at our hospital between March 2021 and December 2022. The prognostic implications of clinical indicators were assessed in patients with postoperative chylothorax who were managed with a low-fat diet. Binary logistic regression was used to explore the predictive value of these indicators for patient prognosis. RESULTS: Postoperative chylothorax occurred in 108 patients and 79 patients were treated with a low-fat diet management while 29 patients were managed with TPN. In contrast to drainage volume, the pleural effusion triglyceride level after 2 days of low-fat diet exhibited enhanced predictive efficacy in predicting patient prognosis. When the pleural fluid triglyceride level of 1.33 mmol/L was used as the diagnostic threshold for prognosis, the sensitivity and specificity reached 100% and 80.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pleural effusion triglyceride level after 2 days of low-fat diet can serve as a valuable prognostic indicator in patients undergoing lung surgery and experiencing chylothorax. This predictive approach will help thoracic surgeons to identify patients with poor prognosis in a timely manner and make decision to perform necessary surgical interventions.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Current evidence on the effect of a low-fat (LF) diet on depression scores has been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of an LF diet on depression scores of adults by systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception to June 7, 2023, to identify trials investigating the effect of an LF diet (fat intake ≤30% of energy intake) on the depression score. DATA EXTRACTION: Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate pooled summary effects of an LF diet on the depression score (as Hedges g). DATA ANALYSIS: Finding from 10 trials with 50 846 participants indicated no significant change in depression score following LF diets in comparison with usual diet (Hedges g = -0.11; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.03; P = 0.12; I2 = 70.7% [for I2, 95% CI, 44%, 85%]). However, a significant improvement was observed in both usual diet and LF diets when the content of protein was 15-20% of calorie intake (LF, normal protein diet: n = 5, Hedges g = -0.21, 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.01, P = 0.04, I2 = 0%; usual, normal protein diet: n = 3, Hedges g = -0.28, 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.05, P = 0.01, I2 = 0%). Sensitivity analysis also found the depression score improved following LF diet intervention in participants without baseline depression. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that LF diet may have small beneficial effect on depression score in the studies enrolled mentally healthy participants. Moreover, achieving to adequate dietary protein is likely to be a better intervention than manipulating dietary fat to improve depression scores. However, it is not clear whether this effect will last in the long term. Conducting more studies may change the results due to the low-certainty of evidence.

Dietary pattern is a modifiable risk factor that represents the main target for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the impact of low-fat diet on anthropometric measurements, biochemical, and inflammatory parameters in individuals with obesity/overweight and NAFLD. A total of 108 individuals (n = 59 males and n = 49 females) aged between 19 and 65 years participated in the 12-week weight loss program. Dietary treatment plans including low-fat diets were randomly prescribed for each individual. Anthropometric measurements were collected by a trained dietitian at baseline and 12-week follow-up. Blood samples were collected for each individual at baseline and 3rd month for biochemical measurements and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21), chemerin, and irisin levels in plasma. At the end of the study, body weight, body mass index, body fat % body fat mass (kg) reduced significantly in females and males (P < .05). Moreover, reductions in waist, hip, and neck circumferences were significant in both groups. Changes in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significant in 3rd month. After 3 months, reductions in TNF-α, IL-6, and FGF-21 levels were significant in individuals with obesity/overweight and NAFLD. While no significant change in chemerin and irisin levels was found. These results show that low-fat diet over a 12-week period led to improvements in both anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters in individuals with obesity/overweight and NAFLD.",

Our study will investigate if an anti-inflammatory dietary programme is superior to a standard care low-fat dietary programme for improving knee pain, function and quality-of-life in people with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The eFEct of an Anti-inflammatory diet for knee oSTeoarthritis study is a parallel-group, assessor-blinded, superiority randomised controlled trial. Following baseline assessment, 144 participants aged 45-85 years with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups (1:1 ratio). Participants randomised to the anti-inflammatory dietary programme will receive six dietary consultations over 12 weeks (two in-person and four phone/videoconference) and additional educational and behaviour change resources. The consultations and resources emphasise nutrient-dense minimally processed anti-inflammatory foods and discourage proinflammatory processed foods. Participants randomised to the standard care low-fat dietary programme will receive three dietary consultations over 12 weeks (two in-person and one phone/videoconference) consisting of healthy eating advice and education based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines, reflecting usual care in Australia. Adherence will be assessed with 3-day food diaries. Outcomes are assessed at 12 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome will be change from baseline to 12 weeks in the mean score on four Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS4) subscales: knee pain, symptoms, function in daily activities and knee-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes include change in individual KOOS subscale scores, patient-perceived improvement, health-related quality of life, body mass and composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, inflammatory (high-sensitivity C reactive protein, interleukins, tumour necrosis factor-α) and metabolic blood biomarkers (glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, liver function, lipids), lower-limb function and physical activity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethics approval from La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee. Results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences.

However, modifications in arterial or venous thrombotic risk profiles of women of reproductive ages on COC remain unclear. The study aimed at assessing the impact of COC on immune activation in diet-induced obesity. We further established whether the dietary intervention of switching from a high-fat diet (HFD) to a low-fat diet (LFD) attenuates immunological responses. Twenty (n=20) five-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into two diet groups of HFD (n=15) and LFD (n=5) and were monitored for eight weeks. After eight weeks, animals in the HFD group switched diets to LFD and were randomly assigned to receive high-dose COC (HCOC) or low-dose COC (LCOC) for six weeks. Animals on HFD significantly gained weight and had a higher lee index when compared to the LFD group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the triglyceride-glucose index, insulin, and other metabolic parameters also increased in the HFD group compared to the LFD group (p < 0.001). Consistently, the levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were elevated in the HFD group when compared to the LFD group (p < 0.05). Upon switching from a high-fat to a low-fat diet, insulin levels persistently increased in animals receiving HCOC treatment compared to the LFD and HFD/LFD groups (p < 0.05). Thus, in a rat model of HFD-feeding, short-term HCOC treatment induces long-term metabolic dysregulation, which persists despite dietary intervention. However, further studies are recommended to confirm these findings.",

OBJECTIVE: Determine whether a low-fat diet improves fatigue in people with MS (PwMS). METHODS: We conducted a 16-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) and allocated PwMS to a low-fat diet (active, total daily fat calories not exceeding 20%) or wait-list (control) group. Subjects underwent 2 weeks of baseline diet data collection (24-hour diet recalls (24HDRs)), followed by randomization. The active group received 2 weeks of nutrition counseling and underwent a 12-week low-fat diet intervention. One set of three 24HDRs at baseline and week 16 were collected. We administered a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) every 4 weeks. The control group continued their pre-study diet and received diet training during the study completion. RESULTS: We recruited 39 PwMS (20-active; 19-control). The active group decreased their daily caloric intake by 11% (95% confidence interval (CI): -18.5%, -3.0%) and the mean MFIS by 4.0 (95% CI: -12.0, 4.0) compared to the control (intent-to-treat). Sensitivity analysis strengthened the association with a mean MFIS difference of -13.9 (95% CI: -20.7, -7.2). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a significant reduction in fatigue with a low-fat dietary intervention in PwMS.",

By low-fat diet, experts mean a diet where the average calories assimilated daily are made up of no more than 30% fat. The Mediterranean Diet, on the other hand, identifies a nutritional model inspired by the traditional eating habits of the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It began to be studied scientifically in the 1950s and it is still today one of the diets that have a positive impact on our health when associated with correct lifestyles. Although epidemiological and mechanistic studies show similar results, there is no evidence from large-scale, long-term clinical trials on the efficacy of the Mediterranean Diet compared with another active group, particularly in secondary prevention. A convincing response has been obtained from the recent CORDIOPREV study (CORonary Diet Intervention with Olive oil and cardiovascular PREVention) which randomized ∼1000 patients with documented coronary artery disease to a Mediterranean Diet or a low-fat dietary intervention. In a 7-year follow-up, the Mediterranean Diet was superior to the low-fat diet in the prevention of major cardiovascular events."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The ketogenic diet (KD) is an intriguing therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer's disease (AD) given its protective effects against metabolic dysregulation and seizures. Gut microbiota are essential for KD-mediated neuroprotection against seizures as well as modulation of bile acids, which play a major role in cholesterol metabolism. These relationships motivated our analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites related to cognitive status following a controlled KD intervention compared with a low-fat-diet intervention. METHODS: Prediabetic adults, either with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitively normal (CN), were placed on either a low-fat American Heart Association diet or high-fat modified Mediterranean KD (MMKD) for 6 weeks; then, after a 6-week washout period, they crossed over to the alternate diet. We collected stool samples for shotgun metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics at five time points to investigate individuals' microbiome and metabolome throughout the dietary interventions. RESULTS: Participants with MCI on the MMKD had lower levels of GABA-producing microbes Alistipes sp. CAG:514 and GABA, and higher levels of GABA-regulating microbes Akkermansia muciniphila. MCI individuals with curcumin in their diet had lower levels of bile salt hydrolase-containing microbes and an altered bile acid pool, suggesting reduced gut motility. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the MMKD may benefit adults with MCI through modulation of GABA levels and gut-transit time.",

In this prospective, observational cohort study of 14 dogs with presumptive PLE and ultrasonographic evidence of lymphangiectasia, subjects were placed on various low-fat diets as monotherapy and prednisone was added if response was deemed inadequate. Dogs were assessed and scored at four recheck examinations across a 6 mo study period, including a final recheck ultrasound. Clinical and clinicopathologic variables were collected and dogs were divided into three outcome groups: clinical remission on dietary monotherapy (LOF); clinical remission on dietary therapy plus immunosuppressive prednisone (LOP); and treatment failure (TXF). Eleven of 14 dogs were in clinical remission at the study end date (6 mo after enrollment): 6 LOF dogs and 5 LOP dogs. LOF dogs achieved a significant reduction in Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index score and a significant increase in serum albumin within 2 wk of beginning dietary monotherapy. Four of 11 dogs in remission also had ultrasonographic evidence of resolution of linear striations.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a calorie-unrestricted LCHF diet, with no intention of weight loss, on T2DM and NAFLD compared with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diet. DESIGN: 6-month randomized controlled trial with a 3-month follow-up. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03068078). SETTING: Odense University Hospital in Denmark from November 2016 until June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 165 participants with T2DM. INTERVENTION: Two calorie-unrestricted diets: LCHF diet with 50 to 60 energy percent (E%) fat, less than 20E% carbohydrates, and 25E% to 30E% proteins and HCLF diet with 50E% to 60E% carbohydrates, 20E% to 30E% fats, and 20E% to 25E% proteins. MEASUREMENTS: Glycemic control, serum lipid levels, metabolic markers, and liver biopsies to assess NAFLD. RESULTS: The mean age was 56 years (SD, 10), and 58% were women. Compared with the HCLF diet, participants on the LCHF diet had greater improvements in hemoglobin A1c (mean difference in change, -6.1 mmol/mol [95% CI, -9.2 to -3.0 mmol/mol] or -0.59% [CI, -0.87% to -0.30%]) and lost more weight (mean difference in change, -3.8 kg [CI, -6.2 to -1.4 kg]). Both groups had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglycerides at 6 months. Changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were less favorable in the LCHF diet group than in the HCLF diet group (mean difference in change, 0.37 mmol/L [CI, 0.17 to 0.58 mmol/L] or 14.3 mg/dL [CI, 6.6 to 22.4 mg/dL]). No statistically significant between-group changes were detected in the assessment of NAFLD. Changes were not sustained at the 9-month follow-up. LIMITATION: Open-label trial, self-reported adherence, unintended weight loss, and lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSION: Persons with T2DM on a 6-month, calorie-unrestricted, LCHF diet had greater clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control and weight compared with those on an HCLF diet, but the changes were not sustained 3 months after intervention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were enrolled into a single arm, prospective study. The eligibility criteria included the diagnosis of RRMS according to the McDonald criteria 2010 and the ability to comply with the diet. Patients were allowed to receive disease modifying therapy (DMT) and to take food supplements. Diet adherence was monitored by food diaries. Number of attacks, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics, Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and Body mass index (BMI) were recorded. RESULTS: Twelve patients with RRMS were enrolled. Six patients (50%) continued with the diet for the median duration of 37 months. The high drop-out of patients was caused mainly by patients' inability to strictly adhere to the diet. In six patients who were able to follow the diet - their mean EDSS of 1.30 decreased to 1.17. None of the patients experienced an attack, 5 of 6 patients had stable disease on yearly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with no new lesions identified. CONCLUSION: The low fat diet is safe and seems to be effective in preventing clinical attacks/new MRI lesions. The main drawback is the problem of adhering to the diet longterm in the western-style diet environment.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Interindividual variability in postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to the same foods may explain why low glycemic index or load and low-carbohydrate diet interventions have mixed weight loss outcomes. A precision nutrition approach that estimates personalized PPGR to specific foods may be more efficacious for weight loss. OBJECTIVE: To compare a standardized low-fat vs a personalized diet regarding percentage of weight loss in adults with abnormal glucose metabolism and obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Personal Diet Study was a single-center, population-based, 6-month randomized clinical trial with measurements at baseline (0 months) and 3 and 6 months conducted from February 12, 2018, to October 28, 2021. A total of 269 adults aged 18 to 80 years with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) ranging from 27 to 50 and a hemoglobin A1c level ranging from 5.7% to 8.0% were recruited. Individuals were excluded if receiving medications other than metformin or with evidence of kidney disease, assessed as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation, to avoid recruiting patients with advanced type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to either a low-fat diet (<25% of energy intake; standardized group) or a personalized diet that estimates PPGR to foods using a machine learning algorithm (personalized group). Participants in both groups received a total of 14 behavioral counseling sessions and self-monitored dietary intake. In addition, the participants in the personalized group received color-coded meal scores on estimated PPGR delivered via a mobile app. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the percentage of weight loss from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, and percentage of body weight), resting energy expenditure, and adaptive thermogenesis. Data were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Analysis was based on intention to treat using linear mixed modeling. RESULTS: Of a total of 204 adults randomized, 199 (102 in the personalized group vs 97 in the standardized group) contributed data (mean [SD] age, 58 [11] years; 133 women [66.8%]; mean [SD] body mass index, 33.9 [4.8]). Weight change at 6 months was -4.31% (95% CI, -5.37% to -3.24%) for the standardized group and -3.26% (95% CI, -4.25% to -2.26%) for the personalized group, which was not significantly different (difference between groups, 1.05% [95% CI, -0.40% to 2.50%]; P = .16). There were no between-group differences in body composition and adaptive thermogenesis; however, the change in resting energy expenditure was significantly greater in the standardized group from 0 to 6 months (difference between groups, 92.3 [95% CI, 0.9-183.8] kcal/d; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A personalized diet targeting a reduction in PPGR did not result in greater weight loss compared with a low-fat diet at 6 months. Future studies should assess methods of increasing dietary self-monitoring adherence and intervention exposure. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03336411.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enoyl-CoA hydratase short-chain 1 (ECHS1) is a key mitochondrial enzyme that is involved in valine catabolism and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Mutations in the ECHS1 gene lead to enzymatic deficiency, resulting in the accumulation of certain intermediates from the valine catabolism pathway. This disrupts the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, with consequent cellular damage. Patients present with a variable age of onset and a wide spectrum of clinical features. The Leigh syndrome phenotype is the most frequently reported form of the disease. Herein, we report a case of a male with ECHS1 deficiency who was diagnosed at 8 years of age. He presented severe dystonia, hyperlordosis, moderate to severe kyphoscoliosis, great difficulty in walking, and severe dysarthria. A valine-restricted and total fat-restricted diet was considered as a therapeutic option after the genetic diagnosis. An available formula that restricted branched-chain amino acids and especially restricted valine was used. We also restricted animal protein intake and provided a low-fat diet that was particularly low in dairy fat. RESULTS: This protein- and fat-restricted diet was initiated with adequate tolerance and adherence. After three years, the patient noticed an improvement in dystonia, especially in walking. He currently requires minimal support to walk or stand. Therefore, he has enhanced his autonomy to go to school or establish a career for himself. His quality of life and motivation for treatment have greatly increased. CONCLUSIONS: There is still a substantial lack of knowledge about this rare disorder, especially knowledge about future effective treatments. However, early diagnosis and treatment with a valine- and fat-restricted diet, particularly dairy fat-restricted diet, appeared to limit disease progression in this patient with ECHS1 deficiency.",

The aim of this review is to summarize the results of current randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of low fat diet (LFD) vs. low carbohydrate diet (LCD) on NAFLD. This is a systematic review of all the available data reported in published clinical trials up to February 2022. The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed, and data were presented aiming specific standard measurements. A total of 15 clinical trial studies were included in this systematic review. There is an overall lack of consensus on which dietary intervention is the most beneficial for NAFLD patients. There is also an overall lack of consensus on the definition of the different restrictive diets and the percentage of macronutrient restriction recommended. It seems that low calorie diets, regardless of their fat and carbohydrate composition, are efficient for liver enzyme reduction. Both LCD and LFD have similar effects on liver enzymes change; however, this improvement tends to be more marked in LFD. All calorie restrictive dietary interventions are beneficial for reducing weight, liver fat content and liver enzymes in individuals with NAFLD. Low fat diets seem to be markedly successful in reducing transaminase levels. Further research is needed to explore diet intensity, duration and long-term outcome."

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the Ideal Protein (IP) system, a commercial weight loss program, compared to a guideline-based, low-calorie/low-fat (LCLF) dietary behavioral intervention on body weight and CVD risk factors in adults with obesity. METHODS: In this randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-group trial, 192 participants with body mass index (BMI) ≥30 and ≤49 kg/m2 were assigned to either the IP Phase I diet or LFLC diet interventions. The IP Phase I is focused on lean protein and vegetables with avoidance of fruit and dairy, while the LFLC diet goals include <30% of daily energy from fat, <7% from saturated fat, 55% from carbohydrate, and an energy deficit of 500 kcal/day. The primary endpoint was change in body weight at 3 months. Secondary endpoints included change in waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), fasting glucose (FG), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). RESULTS: The mean ± SD of change in weight at 3 months was -9.6 ± 12.7 kg in the IP group as compared to -1.6 ± 27.2 kg in the LFLC group. The mean between-group difference in change at 3 months was -8.1 kg (95% confidence interval [CI] -16.6 to 0.6; p = 0.05). Additional significant between-group differences included WC, HC, TC, and TG levels, all favoring the IP group. There were no serious adverse events during the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the IP weight loss program as compared to a guideline-based LCLF dietary behavioral intervention among black and white adults with obesity and CVD risk factors, providing support for the effectiveness of the program."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mediterranean and low-fat diets are effective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We did a long-term randomised trial to compare the effects of these two diets in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: The CORDIOPREV study was a single-centre, randomised clinical trial done at the Reina Sofia University Hospital in Córdoba, Spain. Patients with established coronary heart disease (aged 20-75 years) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by the Andalusian School of Public Health to receive a Mediterranean diet or a low-fat diet intervention, with a follow-up of 7 years. Clinical investigators (physicians, investigators, and clinical endpoint committee members) were masked to treatment assignment; participants were not. A team of dietitians did the dietary interventions. The primary outcome (assessed by intention to treat) was a composite of major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, revascularisation, ischaemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, and cardiovascular death. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00924937. FINDINGS: From Oct 1, 2009, to Feb 28, 2012, a total of 1002 patients were enrolled, 500 (49·9%) in the low-fat diet group and 502 (50·1%) in the Mediterranean diet group. The mean age was 59·5 years (SD 8·7) and 827 (82·5%) of 1002 patients were men. The primary endpoint occurred in 198 participants: 87 in the Mediterranean diet group and 111 in the low-fat group (crude rate per 1000 person-years: 28·1 [95% CI 27·9-28·3] in the Mediterranean diet group vs 37·7 [37·5-37·9] in the low-fat group, log-rank p=0·039). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of the different models ranged from 0·719 (95% CI 0·541-0·957) to 0·753 (0·568-0·998) in favour of the Mediterranean diet. These effects were more evident in men, with primary endpoints occurring in 67 (16·2%) of 414 men in the Mediterranean diet group versus 94 (22·8%) of 413 men in the low-fat diet group (multiadjusted HR 0·669 [95% CI 0·489-0·915], log-rank p=0·013), than in 175 women for whom no difference was found between groups. INTERPRETATION: In secondary prevention, the Mediterranean diet was superior to the low-fat diet in preventing major cardiovascular events. Our results are relevant to clinical practice, supporting the use of the Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention.

OBJECTIVES: Determine the association between indicators of IR and inflammatory biomarkers in MS with and without HTGL and identify how indicators of IR are affected by dietary intervention in MS with HTGL. ANIMALS: Seventy MS with HTGL and 79 MS without HTGL. In addition, 15 MS with HTGL were placed on a low-fat diet. METHODS: Serum concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, calprotectin, insulin, and glucose were compared between groups. RESULTS: Serum glucose and calprotectin concentrations (shown to be higher in MS with HTGL than in MS without HTGL) were inversely correlated (ρ = -.28; P < .001). After dietary intervention, median serum insulin concentrations were 8.1 mU/L compared to 20.8 mU/L before dietary intervention (P = .06). Dogs with complete resolution of HTGL after dietary intervention (5 dogs) had significantly lower serum insulin concentrations compared to baseline (P = .03). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The subclinical inflammatory phenotype in MS with HTGL appears to be associated with IR. Resolution of HTGL by dietary intervention is associated with a decrease in serum insulin concentrations. The implication of the increase in serum calprotectin concentrations after resolution of HTGL warrants further study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lifestyle and dietary habits influence kidney function, playing an important role in the prevention and development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet in preserving kidney function has been seen in primary prevention. However, no scientific evidence is currently available to determine which dietary pattern is more effective in the management of CKD in secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the long-term consumption of two healthy dietary patterns (a Mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) compared to a low-fat diet rich in complex carbohydrates) in preserving kidney function in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. METHODS: CHD patients (n = 1002) from the CORDIOPREV study were randomized to follow a Mediterranean diet (35% fat, 22% MUFA, <50% carbohydrates) or a low-fat diet (28% fat, 12% MUFA, >55% carbohydrates). Kidney function was assessed by the determination of serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and after 5-years of dietary intervention. Patients were classified according to their type 2 diabetes (T2DM) status, using baseline eGFR (normal eGFR: ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; mildly-impaired eGFR: 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, severely-impaired eGFR: <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) to evaluate its influence on the progression of kidney function. Multiple linear regression analysis were performed to determine the contribution of different clinical and anthropometric parameters to changes in eGFR. RESULTS: Although eGFR declined after both dietary interventions compared to baseline (all p < 0.001), the Mediterranean diet produced a lower decline of eGFR compared to the low-fat diet in patients with T2DM (p = 0.040). This effect was also observed when the overall population was considered (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed in eGFR between the two diets in non-T2DM patients. In addition, this differential effect of the Mediterranean diet was mainly observed in patients with mildly-impaired eGFR in which this diet slowed eGFR progression (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term consumption of a Mediterranean diet rich in EVOO, when compared to a low-fat diet, may preserve kidney function, as shown by a reduced decline in eGFR in CHD patients with T2DM. Patients with mildly-impaired eGFR may benefit more from the beneficial effect of the consumption of the Mediterranean diet in preserving kidney function. These findings reinforce the clinical benefits of the Mediterranean diet in the context of secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.

METHODS: Out of 289 apparently healthy obese adults who were chosen by a stratified multistage probability sampling method, 94 of them agreed to participate in the study. They were assigned to low carbohydrate and low fat diet groups. Both groups were followed up for 6 months and the data were taken at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months of intervention. Ninety-four obese adults completed the intervention. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare differences of metabolic dependent variables between the two independent variables, the low carbohydrate and low fat diet, at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months of intervention. RESULTS: The Participants in low carbohydrate diet group had greater decrease in the prevalence of MetS. At the baseline, according to the ATP III criteria, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 44.4% (24/54) in low carbohydrate diet group and 60% (24/40) in low fat diet group. The prevalence of MetS was decreased significantly to 16.7% (9/54) after 3 months and to 3.7% (2/54) after 6 months in low carbohydrate diet (p < 0.001). Moreover, the prevalence of MetS was decreased significantly to 32.5 (13/40) after 3 months and to 22.5% (9/40) after 6 months in low fat diet (p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found between low carbohydrate diet & low fat diet at the baseline (p-value = 0.136) and after 3 months and after 6 months of intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Both low carbohydrate diet and low fat diet have significant effects on reducing the prevalence of MetS in obese adults when followed up for 6 months. Compared to low fat diet, low carbohydrate diet had greater effect in reducing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Both diet programs were found to be effective in improving the metabolic state of obese adults.

This 12-week randomised clinical trial was conducted with children aged 9-17 years diagnosed with NAFLD and randomised into either a Mediterranean Diet or a low-fat diet group. By the end of the study, hepatic steatosis had decreased significantly in both groups (p < 0.001). Liver enzymes also improved significantly, while significant decreases were observed in insulin resistance in both groups, although this decrease was greater in the Mediterranean Diet group (p = 0.010). This study demonstrated that a decrease in hepatic steatosis and an improvement in insulin sensitivity can be achieved with both a Mediterranean Diet and a low-fat diet over 12 weeks, with no significant decrease in the energy required for growth, in children with NAFLD.",

Polytherapy for secondary cardiovascular prevention might mask the effect of MD on the FA profile. This study was aimed to assess whether MD, in comparison with a low-fat diet (LFD), favorably modifies the blood FA profile in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) on polytherapy. One hundred and twenty patients with a recent history of coronary stenting, randomized to MD or to LFD, completed 3 months of this open-label dietary intervention study. Diet Mediterranean-ness was evaluated using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MeDAS) score. Both diets significantly reduced saturated FA (p < 0.01). Putative favorable changes in total n-3 FA (p = 0.03) and eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (EPA + DHA; p = 0.04) were significantly larger with MD than with LFD. At 3 months, in the whole cohort, the MeDAS score correlated inversely with palmitic acid (R = -0.21, p = 0.02), and with palmitoleic acid (R = -0.32, p = 0.007), and positively with total n-3 FA (R = 0.19, p = 0.03), EPA (R = 0.28, p = 0.002), and EPA + DHA (R = 0.21, p = 0.02).

      "abstract": "The Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial (WHIRCDMT) was designed to test whether the US Department of Agriculture's 1977 Dietary Guidelines for Americans protects against coronary heart disease (CHD) and other chronic diseases. The only significant finding in the original 2006 WHIRCDMT publication was that postmenopausal women with CHD randomised to a low-fat 'heart-healthy' diet in 1993 were at 26% greater risk of developing additional CHD events compared with women with CHD eating the control diet. A 2017 WHIRCDMT publication includes data for an additional 5 years of follow-up. It finds that CHD risk in this subgroup of postmenopausal women had increased further to 47%-61%. The authors present three post-hoc rationalisations to explain why this finding is 'inadmissible': (1) only women in this subgroup were less likely to adhere to the prescribed dietary intervention; (2) their failure to follow the intervention diet increased their CHD risk; and (3) only these women were more likely to not have received cholesterol-lowering drugs. These rationalisations appear spurious. Rather these findings are better explained as a direct consequence of postmenopausal women with features of insulin resistance (IR) eating a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 13 years. All the worst clinical features of IR, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in some, can be 'reversed' by the prescription of a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet. The Women's Health Study has recently reported that T2DM (10.71-fold increased risk) and other markers of IR including metabolic syndrome (6.09-fold increased risk) were the most powerful predictors of future CHD development in women; blood low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration was a poor predictor (1.38-fold increased risk). These studies challenge the prescription of the low-fat high-carbohydrate heart-healthy diet, at least in postmenopausal women with IR, especially T2DM. According to the medical principle of 'first do no harm', this practice is now shown to be not evidence-based, making it scientifically unjustifiable, perhaps unethical.",

MED4Youth's main objective is to strengthen the link between the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and the health benefits against youth obesity and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, identifying positive effects exerted by an MD including sourdough bread and healthy products from the Mediterranean basis (chickpeas/hummus, nuts, and pomegranate juice). For this purpose, a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which an MD-based intervention will be compared to a traditional low-fat diet intervention will be carried out with 240 overweight and obese adolescents (13-17 years) from Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Both interventions will be combined with an educational web-application addressed to engage the adolescents through a learning-through-playing approach, using both educational materials and games. To assess the interventions, adherence to the MD, dietary records, physical activity, food frequency, sociodemographic, and quality of life questionnaires as well as classical anthropometric and biochemical parameters will be evaluated. Furthermore, an omics approach will be performed to elucidate whether the interventions can shape the gut microbiota and gut-derived metabolites to gain knowledge on the mechanisms through which the MD can exert its beneficial effects.",

A total of 50 participants (52.3 ± 10.7 years old; 36.6 ± 7.4 kg/m2 BMI; 82% female) were prescribed either a LCHF diet (n = 32, carbohydrate: protein: fat of 5%:30%:65% without calorie restriction), or LF diet (n = 18, 63%:13-23%: 10-25% with calorie restriction of total energy expenditure-500 kcal) for 15 weeks. Central and regional body composition changes from dual-x-ray absorptiometry and serum measures were compared using paired t-tests and ANCOVA with paired contrasts. IR was defined as homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) > 2.6. Compared to the LF group, the LCHF group lost more android (15.6 ± 11.2% vs. 8.3 ± 8.1%, p < 0.01) and visceral fat (18.5 ± 22.2% vs. 5.1 ± 15.8%, p < 0.05). Those with IR lost more android and visceral fat on the LCHF verses LF group (p < 0.05). Therefore, the clinical prescription to a LCHF diet may be an optimal strategy to reduce disease risk in middle-aged adults, particularly those with IR.",

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a commercially available low-fat diet on serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations and lipoprotein profiles in MS with hypertriglyceridemia. ANIMALS: Sixteen MS with hypertriglyceridemia and 28 MS without hypertriglyceridemia. METHODS: Prospective clinical trial. Four blood samples (1-2 months before and 1 day before diet change and 2 and 3 months after the dogs were fed the low-fat diet) were collected from the MS with hypertriglyceridemia. RESULTS: Serum triglyceride concentrations for the 2 samples after the diet change (median of sample 3 = 177 mg/dL; range, 48-498; median of sample 4 = 168 mg/dL; range, 77-745) were significantly lower than the 2 samples before the diet change (median of sample 1 = 480 mg/dL; range, 181-1320; median of sample 2 = 493 mg/dL; range, 114-1395; P < .001). Serum cholesterol concentrations for the 2 samples after the diet change (mean for sample 3 = 257 mg/dL, SD = 82.2; mean for sample 4 = 178 mg/dL, SD = 87.4) were also significantly lower than the 2 samples before the diet change (mean for sample 1 = 381 mg/dL, SD = 146.1; mean for sample 2 = 380 mg/dL, SD = 134.7; P < .001). Before the diet change, 15/16 (94%) of hyperlipidemic MS were classified as hyperlipidemic based on their lipoprotein profiles alone. After the diet change, significantly fewer MS (7/16; 44%; odds ratio = 19.3; 95% CI = 2.0-184.0; P = .006) were classified as hyperlipidemic based on lipoprotein profile analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The study diet was effective in reducing serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations and correcting lipoprotein profiles in MS with hypertriglyceridemia.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is closely associated with changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. To date, studies on the gut microbiota have focused on the genus-level composition and microbial gene sets, whereas changes in the microbiota after clinical treatment have remained largely elusive. In the present study, 16 subjects with T2DM were enrolled and treated long-term with a low-fat diet. Stool samples were collected at the initial diagnosis and after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment, and named as group T0, T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Simultaneously, stool samples from 16 healthy individuals were collected as a control (group C). In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing was performed to detect differences in the microbiota between the groups. Following the low-fat diet treatment, the patients' fasting plasma glucose, plasma glucose 2 h after challenge, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c and body mass index (BMI) decreased significantly. The composition of the phylum in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was similar to that in healthy individuals. A total of 23 genera from four phyla, namely Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, were determined to be different between group T0 and group C, while only 8 genera were different between group T3 and group C. Repeated analysis of variance suggested a complex change during the low-fat diet treatment. The butyrate-producing bacteria Anaerotruncus exhibited a slight increase, while Roseburia was significantly increased at the T1 stage but then gradually decreased at the later stage. In summary, a low-fat diet was effective for patients with T2DM in reducing blood glucose and the BMI, and, to a certain extent, improving the intestinal flora to reach a normal composition. The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR; registration no. ChiCTR1900028663)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Omega-3 fatty acids (OM3-FAs) are recommended with a low-fat diet for severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), to reduce triglycerides and acute pancreatitis (AP) risk. A low-fat diet may reduce pancreatic lipase secretion, which is required to absorb OM3-ethyl esters (OM3-EEs), but not OM3-carboxylic acids (OM3-CAs). METHODS: In this exploratory, randomized, open-label, crossover study, 15 patients with SHTG and previous AP were instructed to take OM3-CA (2 g or 4 g) and OM3-EE 4 g once daily for 4 weeks, while adhering to a low-fat diet. On day 28 of each treatment phase, a single dose was administered in the clinic with a liquid low-fat meal, to assess 24-h plasma exposure. Geometric least-squares mean ratios were used for between-treatment comparisons of baseline (day 0)-adjusted area under the plasma concentration versus time curves (AUC0-24) and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). RESULTS: Before initiating OM3-FA treatment, mean baseline fasting plasma EPA + DHA concentrations (nmol/mL) were 723 for OM3-CA 2 g, 465 for OM3-CA 4 g and 522 for OM3-EE 4 g. At week 4, mean pre-dose fasting plasma EPA + DHA concentrations increased by similar amounts (+ 735 - + 768 nmol/mL) for each treatment. During the 24-h exposure assessment (day 28), mean plasma EPA + DHA increased from pre-dose to the maximum achieved concentration by + 32.7%, + 45.8% and + 3.1% with single doses of OM3-CA 2 g, OM3-CA 4 g and OM3-EE 4 g, respectively. Baseline-adjusted AUC0-24 was 60% higher for OM3-CA 4 g than for OM3-EE 4 g and baseline-adjusted Cmax was 94% higher (both non-significant). CONCLUSIONS: Greater 24-h exposure of OM3-CA versus OM3-EE was observed for some parameters when administered with a low-fat meal at the clinic on day 28. However, increases in pre-dose fasting plasma EPA + DHA over the preceding 4-week dosing period were similar between treatments, leading overall to non-significant differences in baseline (day 0)-adjusted AUC0-24 and Cmax EPA + DHA values. It is not clear why the greater 24-h exposure of OM3-CA versus OM3-EE observed with a low-fat meal did not translate into significantly higher pre-dose fasting levels of DHA + EPA with longer-term use.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women without cardiovascular disease (CVD) or hypertension at baseline assigned to intervention in the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification (DM) trial experienced 30% lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), whereas results in women with hypertension or prior CVD could have been confounded by postrandomization use of statins. OBJECTIVES: Intervention participants reported various self-selected changes to achieve the 20% total fat goals. Reviewed are intervention compared with comparison group HRs for CHD, stroke, and total CVD in relation to specific dietary changes in normotensive participants. METHODS: Dietary change was assessed by comparing baseline with year 1 FFQ data in women (n = 10,371) without hypertension or CVD at baseline with intake of total fat above the median to minimize biases due to use of the FFQ in trial eligibility screening. RESULTS: Intervention participants self-reported compensating reduced energy intake from total fat by increasing carbohydrate and protein. Specifically they increased plant protein, with those in the upper quartile (increased total protein by ≥3.3% of energy) having a CHD HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.71), compared with 0.92 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.48) for those in the lower quartile of change (decreased total protein ≥0.6% of energy), with P-trend of 0.04. CHD HR did not vary significantly with change in percentage energy from carbohydrate, and stroke HR did not vary significantly with any macronutrient changes. Scores reflecting adherence to recommended dietary patterns including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial and the Healthy Eating Index showed favorable changes in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention group total fat reduction replaced with increased carbohydrate and some protein, especially plant-based protein, was related to lower CHD risk in normotensive women without CVD who reported high baseline total fat intake.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate circulating adiposity-related miRNAs as biomarkers of the response to two specific weight loss dietary treatments. The expression of 86 miRNAs was investigated in plasma of 78 subjects with obesity randomized to two different diets [moderately high-protein diet (n = 38) and low-fat diet (n = 40)] and in 25 eutrophic controls (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2 ). Bioinformatic analyses were performed to explore the target genes and biological pathways regulated by the dysregulated miRNAs. As results, 26 miRNAs were found differently expressed in eutrophic and volunteers with obesity. Moreover, 7 miRNAs (miR-130a-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-144-5p, miR-15a-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-221-3p and miR-29c-3p) were differentially expressed between responders and non-responders to a low-fat diet. Furthermore, after adjustment for basal glucose levels, 1-SD increase in miR-22-3p expression was associated with reduction in the risk of non-response to low-fat diet [OR = 0.181, 95% CI (0.084-0.947), P = .043]. Bioinformatic analyses evidenced that these 7 miRNAs regulate the expression of genes participating in important metabolic pathways. Conclusively, 7 circulating miRNAs related to adiposity could be used for predicting the response to a low-fat diet intervention prescribed to lose weight.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), such as the oxidized derivatives of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, and 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, have been shown to be the principal biologically active components of minimally oxidized LDL (low-density lipoprotein). The role of OxPL in cardiovascular diseases is well recognized, including activation of inflammation within vascular cells. Atherosclerotic Apoe-/- mice fed a high-fat diet develop antibodies to OxPL, and hybridoma B-cell lines producing natural anti-OxPL autoantibodies have been successfully generated and characterized. However, as yet, no studies have been reported demonstrating that treatment with OxPL neutralizing antibodies can be used to prevent or reverse advanced atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: Here, using a screening against 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine/1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, we generated a novel IgM autoantibody, 10C12, from the spleens of Apoe-/- mice fed a long-term Western diet, that demonstrated potent OxPL neutralizing activity in vitro and the ability to inhibit macrophage accumulation within arteries of Apoe-/- mice fed a Western diet for 4 weeks. Of interest, 10C12 failed to inhibit atherosclerosis progression in Apoe-/- mice treated between 18 and 26 weeks of Western diet feeding likely due at least in part to high levels of endogenous anti-OxPL antibodies. However, 10C12 treatment caused a 40% decrease in lipid accumulation within aortas of secreted IgM deficient, sIgM-/-Apoe-/-, mice fed a low-fat diet, when the antibody was administrated between 32-40 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results provide direct evidence showing that treatment with a single autoimmune anti-OxPL IgM antibody during advanced disease stages can have an atheroprotective outcome.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern positively influences clinical outcomes in cardiovascular prevention, but long-term adherence is difficult to maintain. We evaluated 5-year changes in dietary habits, adherence achieved, and its maintenance in a cohort of coronary patients from the CORDIOPREV study. METHODS: 1002 coronary patients were randomized to a Mediterranean diet (n = 502) or a low-fat diet (n = 500) and received individual-group-telephone visits and personalized dietary advice. A validated food-frequency questionnaire, a 14-point Mediterranean diet adherence screener, and a 9-point low-fat diet adherence score were used. Dietary adherence was categorized into Low, Medium, and High Adherence. Changes in nutrient intake, food consumption, and adherence were analyzed on a yearly basis. The maintenance of long-term dietary adherence was evaluated using data after the first year and fifth year. RESULTS: From baseline to 5 years, significant increases were observed in overall dietary adherence (Mediterranean diet from 8.9 to 11.4; low-fat diet from 3.9 to 7.1) and in the percentage of patients considered High Adherence (Mediterranean diet from 41 to 89%; low-fat diet from 4 to 67%). When we evaluated the maintenance of adherence, patients considered Low and Medium Adherence at 1 year increased their adherence at the 5 years with both diets and patients considered High Adherence maintained their adherence with a Mediterranean diet, but decreased their adherence with a low-fat diet. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive dietary intervention results in an overall long-term improvement and maintenance of adherence to the Mediterranean and low-fat diets. In our population, the Mediterranean diet group achieved a high level of adherence in the short term which was maintained in the long term.",

While low-fat diet improves cardiovascular risk, its contributions on microvascular function, independent of weight loss, is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation in microvessels is improved by low-fat diets designed for weight loss (LFWL) compared to low-fat weight maintenance (LFWM) diet. Obese adults were randomly assigned to either a LFWL diet (n = 11) or LFWM diet (n = 10) for six weeks. Microvessels were obtained from gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after the intervention for vascular reactivity measurements to acetylcholine (Ach) and flow, with and without L-NAME or indomethacin. Vascular and serum NO and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also measured. LFWL diet increased flow-induced (FID) and ACh-induced dilation (AChID); an effect that was inhibited by L-NAME. Conversely, LFWM diet did not affect FID or AChID. Indomethacin improved FID and AChID in the baseline and this effect was minimized in response to both diets. Serum NO or CRP did not change in response to either diet. In conclusion, LFWL diet improves microvascular reactivity compared to LFWM diet and increased vascular NO contribution to the improved microvascular dilation. These data suggest that weight reduction on low fat diet is critical for microvascular health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIM: It is unclear if a reduction in hepatic fat content (HFC) is a major mediator of the cardiometabolic benefit of lifestyle intervention, and whether it has prognostic significance beyond the loss of visceral adipose tissue (VAT). In the present sub-study, we hypothesized that HFC loss in response to dietary interventions induces specific beneficial effects independently of VAT changes. METHODS: In an 18-month weight-loss trial, 278 participants with abdominal obesity/dyslipidemia were randomized to low-fat (LF) or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC + 28 g walnuts/day) diets with/without moderate physical activity. HFC and abdominal fat-depots were measured using magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, after 6 (sub-study, n = 158) and 18 months. RESULTS: Of 278 participants (mean HFC 10.2% [range: 0.01%-50.4%]), the retention rate was 86.3%. The %HFC substantially decreased after 6 months (-6.6% absolute units [-41% relatively]) and 18 months (-4.0% absolute units [-29% relatively]; p <0.001 vs. baseline). Reductions of HFC were associated with decreases in VAT beyond weight loss. After controlling for VAT loss, decreased %HFC remained independently associated with reductions in serum gamma glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase, circulating chemerin, and glycated hemoglobin (p <0.05). While the reduction in HFC was similar between physical activity groups, MED/LC induced a greater %HFC decrease (p = 0.036) and greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk parameters (p <0.05) than the LF diet, even after controlling for VAT changes. Yet, the greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk parameters induced by MED/LC were all markedly attenuated when controlling for HFC changes. CONCLUSIONS: %HFC is substantially reduced by diet-induced moderate weight loss and is more effectively reduced by the MED/LC diet than the LF diet, independently of VAT changes. The beneficial effects of the MED/LC diet on specific cardiometabolic parameters appear to be mediated more by decreases in %HFC than VAT loss. LAY SUMMARY: High hepatic fat content is associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. In the CENTRAL 18-month intervention trial, a Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate diet induced a greater decrease in hepatic fat content than a low-fat diet, conferring beneficial health effects that were beyond the favorable effects of visceral fat loss.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a high-fat or high-fructose diet increases intestinal permeability and promotes derangement of the gut-liver axis. We hypothesize that, diet could be able to modulate intestinal permeability in patients with NAFLD. AIM: To detect diet-induced modification of intestinal permeability in patients with NAFLD undergoing a Mediterranean diet or a low-fat diet. METHODS: The current study was a dietary intervention for non-diabetic, patients with biopsy-verified NAFLD and increased transaminases. A crossover design was employed: participants underwent 16 weeks of Mediterranean diet, 16 wk of free wash-out, and 16 weeks of low-fat diet. Both diets were hypocaloric and no consumption of supplements was allowed. All patients were followed bimonthly by a dietitian. Evaluations of clinical and metabolic parameters were completed at baseline and at the end of each dietary period. Intestinal permeability was assessed by chromium-51 ethylene diamine tetraacetate excretion testing (51Cr-EDTA). RESULTS: Twenty Caucasian patients, 90% male, median age 43 years, body mass index (BMI) 30.9, with biopsy-verified NAFLD were enrolled. At the end of 16 weeks of a Mediterranean diet, a significant reduction in mean body weight (-5.3 ± 4.1 kg, P = 0.003), mean waist circumference (-7.9 ± 4.9 cm, P = 0.001), and mean transaminase levels [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) -28.3 ± 11.9 IU/L, P = 0.0001; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) -6.4 ± 56.3 IU/L, P = 0.01] were observed. These benefits were maintained after 16 wk of wash-out and also after 16 wk of low-fat diet, without further improvements. Fourteen of the 20 patients had intestinal permeability alteration at baseline (mean percentage retention of 51Cr-EDTA = 5.4%), but no significant changes in intestinal permeability were observed at the end of the 16 wk of the Mediterranean diet or 16 wk of the low-fat diet. CONCLUSION: Mediterranean diet is an effective strategy for treating overweight, visceral obesity and serum transaminase in patients with NAFLD. If the Mediterranean diet can improve intestinal permeability in patients with NAFLD, it deserves further investigation.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that during dietary intervention for weight loss, auricular electric stimulation (AES), an alternative of VNS, accelerates weight loss by increasing white adipose tissue (WAT) browning and increases energy expenditure. METHODS: C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet for 5 wk. to induce obesity, then switched to a low-fat diet for 5 wk. and allocated into 3 groups to receive 2 Hz electric stimulation on ears, electrode clamps only, or nothing (AES, Sham and Ctrl, respectively). RESULTS: Switching to a low-fat diet reduced body weight progressively in all 3 groups, with the greatest reduction in the AES group. In accordance with a mild decrease in feed intake, hypothalamus mRNA levels of Npy, AgRP tended to be reduced, while Pomc tended to be increased by AES. Mice in the AES group had the highest concentrations of norepinephrine in serum and inguinal WAT, and expression levels of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) and tyrosine hydroxylase in inguinal WAT. Furthermore, their subcutaneous adipocytes had multilocular and UCP-1+ characteristics, along with a smaller cell size. CONCLUSION: AES, by increasing WAT browning, could be used in conjunction with a low-fat diet to augment weight loss in addition to suppressing appetite.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The metabolic syndrome (MS) is an emerging complication in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), with no preventive or therapeutic treatment reported yet. We wanted to compare the impact of two 6-month nutritional interventions, based on a Mediterranean (MED) or a low-fat diet, on waist circumference, anthropometric and metabolic outcomes in patients with both T1D and the MS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants were randomized into 2 intervention groups: 1) MED-diet or 2) low-fat diet. The 6-month study included 9 teaching sessions with a registered dietitian. Anthropometric (primary outcome: waist circumference), metabolic and nutritional assessments were performed at inclusion, 3 and 6-month. We used mixed effects models to assess the effects of both interventions. 28 participants were included (50.9 ± 10.3 years old) with a mean BMI of 30.7 ± 3.3 kg/m2 and a waist circumference of 105.5 ± 8.9 cm at inclusion. A trend towards a greater reduction of dietary fat intakes in the low-fat diet group was observed (P-interaction = 0.09). Waist circumference was reduced at 6-month in both groups (-3.5 cm low-fat; -1.5 cm MED-diet) with no significant difference between groups (P-interaction = 0.43). Body mass index also significantly decreased in both groups (-0.7 kg/m2 low-fat; -1.1 kg/m2 MED-diet; P-interaction = 0.56). No significant differences between groups were observed for other metabolic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a 6-month non-restrictive dietary intervention in patients with T1D and MS could contribute to weight management, without significant differences between interventions for anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Further studies should investigate the long-term benefits of these diets. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: NCT02821585 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is becoming increasingly recognized that weight and nutritional status can impact cancer survival. We have previously shown that obese mice with syngeneic acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have poorer response to chemotherapy treatment than control mice. We therefore investigated whether dietary intervention could improve outcome from the most common pediatric cancer, ALL. METHODS: Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice raised on a 60% calories from fat diet and control mice were implanted with syngeneic ALL cells. Some DIO mice were switched to the low-fat control diet. Survival from ALL was assessed without or with chemotherapy treatment starting at the time of the diet switch. Cells from DIO mice before and after diet switch were assessed by FACS for BrdU incorporation and phosphorylation status of AKT, S6K, and EIF2a. Similar experiments were done with human ALL xenografts. Mouse and human ALL cells were cultured in media with 10% or 5% fetal bovine serum, and sensitivity to chemotherapies assessed. RESULTS: DIO mice had poorer survival (17%) after vincristine monotherapy than control mice on a 10% low fat diet (42%; n = 12/group; p = 0.09, log rank). However, switching obese mice to the low-fat diet prior to initiation of vincristine led to dramatically improved survival (92%, p < 0.01 vs both other groups). In vitro, FBS restriction made murine and human ALL cells more sensitive to vincristine. Interestingly, while serum restriction enhanced ALL sensitivity to dexamethasone and l-asparaginase, dietary switch did not improve survival of DIO mice treated with either drug in monotherapy. Thus, it appears that dietary intervention has a unique effect to improve ALL cell sensitivity to vincristine in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: We report herein that a dietary intervention can improve ALL outcome in a preclinical model. Further work is needed to identify the mechanisms of this effect and investigate potential impact on human leukemia in patients."

In this 16-week randomized clinical trial, we tested the role of a low-fat, plant-based diet on body weight, body composition and insulin resistance. As a part of this trial, we investigated the role of changes in carbohydrate intake on body composition and insulin resistance. Participants (n = 75) were randomized to follow a plant-based high-carbohydrate, low-fat (vegan) diet (n = 38) or to maintain their current diet (n = 37). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure body composition. Insulin resistance was assessed with the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) index. A repeated measure ANOVA model was used to test the between-group differences from baseline to 16 weeks. A linear regression model was used to test the relationship between carbohydrate intake, and body composition and insulin resistance. Weight decreased significantly in the vegan group (treatment effect -6.5 [95% CI -8.9 to -4.1] kg; Gxt, p < 0.001). Fat mass was reduced in the vegan group (treatment effect -4.3 [95% CI -5.4 to -3.2] kg; Gxt, p < 0.001). HOMA-IR was reduced significantly in the vegan group (treatment effect -1.0 [95% CI -1.2 to -0.8]; Gxt, p = 0.004). Changes in consumption of carbohydrate, as a percentage of energy, correlated negatively with changes in BMI (r = -0.53, p < 0.001), fat mass (r = -0.55, p < 0.001), volume of visceral fat (r = -0.35, p = 0.006), and HOMA (r = -0.27, p = 0.04). These associations remained significant after adjustment for energy intake. Changes in consumption of total and insoluble fiber correlated negatively with changes in BMI (r = -0.43, p < 0.001; and r = -0.46, p < 0.001, respectively), fat mass (r = -0.42, p < 0.001; and r = -0.46, p < 0.001, respectively), and volume of visceral fat (r = -0.29, p = 0.03; and r = -0.32, p = 0.01, respectively). The associations between total and insoluble fiber and changes in BMI and fat mass remained significant even after adjustment for energy intake. Increased carbohydrate and fiber intake, as part of a plant-based high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, are associated with beneficial effects on weight, body composition, and insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "How dietary patterns impact colonic bacterial biosynthesis of vitamins and utilization by humans is poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate whether a reciprocal dietary switch between rural South Africans (traditionally high fibre, low fat) and African Americans (Western diet of low fibre, high fat) affects colonic folate synthesis. Colonic evacuants were obtained from 20 rural South Africans and 20 African Americans consuming their usual diets at baseline. For 2 weeks thereafter, rural South Africans were provided with a Western diet (protein, 27%; fat, 52%; carbohydrate, 20%; and fibre, 8 g/day) and African Americans were provided with a high fibre, low-fat diet (protein, 16%; fat, 17%; carbohydrate, 63%; and fibre, 43 g/day). Colonic evacuants were again collected. No difference between groups at baseline in the folate content of 3-h evacuants was observed. The high-fibre, low-fat diet consumed by African Americans during the intervention produced a 41% increase in mean total folate content compared with baseline values (p = 0.0037). No change was observed in rural South Africans consuming a Western diet. Mean total folate content of colonic evacuants was higher among African Americans at the end of the dietary switch (3107 ± 1811 μg) compared with rural South Africans (2157 ± 1956 μg) (p = 0.0409). In conclusion, consistent with animal studies, switching from a Western diet to one higher in fibre and lower in fat can be expected to result in greater colonic folate content. Future research should confirm that these observations are not transitory and understand the contribution of transit-time to the findings.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Lomitapide is an oral inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein used to treat homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH); patients require a low-fat diet to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects and dietary supplements to prevent nutrient deficiencies. We investigated the diet and nutritional status during lomitapide treatment. METHODS: Japanese patients with HoFH, who were in a phase 3 trial of lomitapide, were instructed to start low-fat diets with supplements of vitamin E and essential fatty acids 6 weeks before starting lomitapide treatment. Dietary education was conducted by registered dietitians 16 times during the study period, which included a pre-treatment run-in phase (Weeks －6-0), a lomitapide treatment efficacy phase (Weeks 0-26) and a safety phase (Weeks 26-56). Two-day dietary records were collected at each dietary counseling session. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured at Weeks 0, 26 and 56. RESULTS: Eight patients completed the 56 weeks of lomitapide treatment. Their median energy intakes derived from lipids were 19.2% and 17.9% during the efficacy and safety phases, respectively. \"Fats and oils\" intakes, and \"Fatty meat and poultry\" intakes in two patients, were successfully reduced to achieve low-fat diets. Although intakes of energy, fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins did not differ significantly among phases, body weight, serum fatty acid levels and vitamin E concentrations were decreased at Week 26 as compared with Week 0. CONCLUSION: HoFH patients can adhere to low-fat diets with ongoing dietary counseling. Instructions about intakes of energy, fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins, as well as periodic evaluations of nutritional status, are necessary.",

      "abstract": "A higher dietary inflammatory index (DII®) score is associated with inflammation and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). We hypothesized that a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) intervention would reduce DII score. We assessed dietary data from a randomized controlled trial comparing 6-month MedDiet versus low-fat diet intervention, in patients with CHD. We aimed to determine the DII scores of the prescribed diets' model meal plans, followed by whether dietary intervention led to lower (i.e., more anti-inflammatory) DII scores and consequently lower high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (hs-IL-6). DII scores were calculated from 7-day food diaries. The MedDiet meal plan had a markedly lower DII score than the low-fat diet meal plan (-4.55 vs. -0.33, respectively). In 56 participants who completed the trial (84% male, mean age 62 ± 9 years), the MedDiet group significantly reduced DII scores at 6 months (n = 27; -0.40 ± 3.14 to -1.74 ± 2.81, P = .008) and the low-fat diet group did not change (n = 29; -0.17 ± 2.27 to 0.05 ± 1.89, P = .65). There was a significant post-intervention adjusted difference in DII score between groups (compared to low-fat, MedDiet decreased by -1.69 DII points; P = .004). When compared to the low-fat diet, the MedDiet non-significantly reduced hs-IL-6 (-0.32 pg/mL, P = .29) and increased hs-CRP (+0.09 mg/L, P = .84). These findings demonstrated that MedDiet intervention significantly reduced DII scores compared to a low-fat diet. However, in this small cohort of patients with CHD this did not translate to a significant improvement in measured inflammatory markers. The effect of improvement in DII with MedDiet should be tested in larger intervention trials and observational cohorts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common metabolic disorder all over the world, mainly being associated with a sedentary lifestyle, adiposity, and nutrient imbalance. The increasing prevalence of NAFLD accommodates similar developments for type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related comorbidities and complications. Therefore, early detection of NAFLD is an utmost necessity. Potentially helpful tools for the prediction of NAFLD are liver fat indices. The fatty liver index (FLI) and the NAFLD-liver fat score (NAFLD-LFS) have been recently introduced for this aim. However, both indices have been shown to correlate with liver fat status, but there is neither sufficient data on the longitudinal representation of liver fat change, nor proof of a diet-independent correlation between actual liver fat change and change of index values. While few data sets on low-fat diets have been published recently, low-carb diets have not been yet assessed in this context. AIM: We aim to provide such data from a highly effective short-term intervention to reduce liver fat, comparing a low-fat and a low-carb diet in subjects with prediabetes. METHODS: Anthropometric measurements, magnetic resonance (MR)-based intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content, and several serum markers for liver damage have been collected in 140 subjects, completing the diet phase in this trial. Area-under-the-responder-operator-curves (AUROC) calculations as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal Spearman correlations were used. RESULTS: Both FLI and NAFLD-LFS predict liver fat with moderate accuracy at baseline (AUROC 0.775-0.786). These results are supported by correlation analyses. Changes in liver fat, achieved by the dietary intervention, correlate moderately with changes in FLI and NAFLD-LFS in the low-fat diet, but not in the low-carb diet. A correlation analysis between change of actual IHL content and change of single elements of the liver fat indices revealed diet-specific moderate to strong correlations between ΔIHL and changes of measures of obesity, ΔTG, and ΔALT (all low-fat, only) and between ΔIHL and ΔGGT (low-carb, only). With exception for a stronger decrease of triglycerides (TG) levels in the low-carb diet, there is no statistically significant difference in the effect of the diets on anthropometric or serum-based score parameters. CONCLUSION: While liver fat indices have proved useful in the early detection of NAFLD and may serve as a cost-saving substitute for expensive MR measurements in the cross-sectional evaluation of liver status, their capability to represent interventional changes of liver fat content appears to be diet-specific and lacks accuracy. Liver fat reduction by low-fat diets can be monitored with moderate precision, while low-carb diets require different measuring techniques to demonstrate the same dietary effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many physiological health benefits observed after following a ketogenic diet (KD) can be attributed to the associated weight loss. The KD has become more prominent as a popular health choice, not only in obese/overweight individuals, but also in healthy adults. The study aims to determine the effects of a KD, independent of weight loss, on various aspects of physiological health including: sleep, thyroid function, cognition, and cardio-metabolic health. The study will also aim to determine whether a change in basal metabolic rate may be associated with any changes observed. METHODS: Twenty healthy men and women between 18 and 50 years of age will take part in this study. In a randomized controlled, cross-over design, participants will follow two isocaloric diets: a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (55% CHO, 20% fat, 25% protein) and a KD (15% CHO, 60% fat, 25% protein). Each dietary intervention will last for a minimum of 3 weeks, with a 1-week washout period in between. Before and after each diet, participants will be assessed for sleep quality, cognitive function, thyroid function, and basal metabolic rate. A blood sample will also be taken for the measurement of cardio-metabolic and immune markers. DISCUSSION: The present study will help in understanding the potential effects of a KD on aspects of physiological health in healthy adults, without the confounding factor of weight loss. The study aims to fill a significant void in the academic literature with regards to the benefits and/or risks of a KD in a healthy population, but will also explore whether diet-related metabolic changes may be responsible for the changes observed in physiological health.

METHODS: A total of 115 adults with T2D (mean [SD]; BMI, 34.6 [4.3] kg/m2 ; age, 58 [7] years; HbA1c, 7.3 [1.1]%) were randomized to 1 of 2 planned energy-matched, hypocaloric diets combined with aerobic/resistance exercise (1 hour, 3 days/week) for 2 years: LC: 14% energy as carbohydrate, 28% as protein, 58% as fat (<10% saturated fat); or low-fat, high-carbohydrate, low-glycaemic index diet (HC): 53% as CHO, 17% as protein, 30% as fat (<10% saturated fat). HbA1c, glycaemic variability (GV), anti-glycaemic medication effect score (MES, calculated based on the potency and dosage of diabetes medication), weight, body composition, CVD and renal risk markers were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: A total of 61 (LC = 33, HC = 28) participants completed the study (trial registration: http://www.anzctr.org.au/, ANZCTR No. ACTRN12612000369820). Reductions in weight (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]; LC, -6.8 [-8.8,-4.7], HC, -6.6 [-8.8, -4.5] kg), body fat (LC, -4.3 [-6.2, -2.4], HC, -4.6 [-6.6, -2.7] kg), blood pressure (LC, -2.0 [-5.9, 1.8]/ -1.2 [-3.6, 1.2], HC, -3.2 [-7.3, 0.9]/ -2.0 [-4.5, 0.5] mmHg), HbA1c (LC, -0.6 [-0.9, -0.3], HC, -0.9 [-1.2, -0.5] %) and fasting glucose (LC, 0.3 [-0.4, 1.0], HC, -0.4 [-1.1, 0.4] mmol/L) were similar between groups (P ≥ 0.09). Compared to HC, the LC achieved greater reductions in diabetes medication use (MES; LC, -0.5 [-0.6, -0.3], HC, -0.2 [-0.4, -0.02] units; P = 0.03), GV (Continuous Overall Net Glycemic Action calculated every 1 hour (LC, -0.4 [-0.6, -0.3], HC, -0.1 [-0.1, 0.2] mmol/L; P = 0.001), and 4 hours (LC, -0.9 [-1.3, -0.6], HC, -0.2 [-0.6, 0.1] mmol/L; P = 0.02)); triglycerides (LC, -0.1 [-0.3, 0.2], HC, 0.1 [-0.2, 0.3] mmol/L; P = 0.001), and maintained HDL-C levels (LC, 0.02 [-0.05, 0.1], HC, -0.1 [-0.1, 0.01] mmol/L; P = 0.004), but had similar changes in LDL-C (LC, 0.2 [-0.1, 0.5], HC, 0.1 [-0.2, 0.4] mmol/L; P = 0.85), brachial artery flow mediated dilatation (LC, -0.5 [-1.5, 0.5], HC, -0.4 [-1.4, 0.7] %; P = 0.73), eGFR and albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Both diets achieved comparable weight loss and HbA1c reductions. The LC sustained greater reductions in diabetes medication requirements, and in improvements in diurnal blood glucose stability and blood lipid profile, with no adverse renal effects, suggesting greater optimization of T2D management.",

      "abstract": "Background: Weight loss is a key factor in reducing diabetes risk. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a completed clinical trial that randomly assigned individuals at high risk of diabetes to a placebo (PLBO), metformin (MET), or intensive lifestyle intervention (ILS) group, which included physical activity (PA) and reduced dietary fat intake.Objective: We aimed to evaluate the associations between diet and weight at baseline and to identify specific dietary factors that predicted weight loss among DPP participants.Methods: Diet was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. The associations between intakes of macronutrients and various food groups and body weight among DPP participants at baseline were assessed by linear regression, adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, sex, calorie intake, and PA. Models that predicted weight loss at year 1 were adjusted for baseline weight, change in calorie intake, and change in PA and stratified by treatment allocation (MET, ILS, and PLBO). All results are presented as estimates ± SEs.Results: A total of 3234 participants were enrolled in the DPP; 2924 had completed dietary data (67.5% women; mean age: 50.6 ± 10.7 y). Adjusted for calorie intake, baseline weight was negatively associated with carbohydrate intake (-1.14 ± 0.18 kg body weight/100 kcal carbohydrate, P < 0.0001) and, specifically, dietary fiber (-1.26 ± 0.28 kg/5 g fiber, P < 0.0001). Baseline weight was positively associated with total fat (1.25 ± 0.21 kg/100 kcal, P < 0.0001), saturated fat (1.96 ± 0.46 kg/100 kcal, P < 0.0001), and protein (0.21 ± 0.05 kg/100 kcal, P < 0.0001). For all groups, weight loss after 1 y was associated with increases in carbohydrate intake, specifically dietary fiber, and decreases in total fat and saturated fat intake.Conclusions: Higher carbohydrate consumption among DPP participants, specifically high-fiber carbohydrates, and lower total and saturated fat intake best predicted weight loss when adjusted for changes in calorie intake. Our results support the benefits of a high-carbohydrate, high-fiber, low-fat diet in the context of overall calorie reduction leading to weight loss, which may prevent diabetes in high-risk individuals. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00004992.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Taste blindness to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) associates with increased fat preference and intake. No studies have matched a diet to a woman's PROP phenotype to improve weight loss. This study investigated (1) whether PROP nontaster (NT) women would lose more weight following a low-carbohydrate (LC) diet than a low-fat (LF) diet, and (2) whether PROP supertaster (ST) women would lose more weight following a LF diet than a LC diet. METHODS: One hundred seven women (BMI = 34.8 ± 0.5 kg/m2 ), classified as PROP NTs (n = 47) and STs (n = 60), were randomized to a LC or LF diet within a 6-month lifestyle intervention. Assessments included 4-day dietary recalls and biobehavioral and psychosocial questionnaires. RESULTS: At 6 months, NTs lost more weight following the LC than the LF diet (-8.5 ± 0.5 kg vs. -6.6 ± 0.5 kg, P = 0.008); there was no difference between STs following either diet (-8.8 ± 0.4 vs. -8.9 ± 0.5, P = 0.35). Dietary self-reports were unrelated to weight loss, and prescription of a LC diet associated with greater self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: NT women lost more weight following the LC diet compared to the LF diet. Screening for PROP phenotype may help personalize diet therapy for NT women to optimize their short-term weight loss.",

OBJECTIVE: To examine food group intake change and its relation to reductions in energy and fat intake and weight during a lifestyle intervention. DESIGN: Secondary cohort analysis. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-nine participants (aged 52.0±8.6 years, body mass index 34.9±4.5, 92% white, 97.6% non-Hispanic, and 56.8% women) with complete data at 0 and 6 months collected in a research setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: From three 24-hour telephone dietary recalls, 165 food groups from Nutrition Data System for Research software were coded into 25 larger food groups assessing intake of higher-fat and/or added-sugar food groups vs naturally lower-fat and/or added-sugar food groups and into 17 larger food groups assessing intake of nonmodified vs fat- and/or sugar-modified food groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Repeated measures analyses of covariance (intervention group: covariate) assessed changes from 0 to 6 months. Hierarchical regressions examined changes in food group intake and changes in energy intake, percent energy from fat intake, and weight from 0 to 6 months. RESULTS: Significant reductions (P<0.05) in intake of high-fat and/or high-added-sugar food groups (Higher-Fat Dairy; Higher-Fat Eggs; Higher-Fat Fats; Higher-Fat Fruit; Higher-Fat Meat; Nonmodified Higher-Fat Fats, Oils, and Sweets; Nonmodified Higher-Fat Sugar-Sweetened Fats, Oils, and Sweets; Nonmodified Regular-Fat Dairy; and Nonmodified Regular-Fat Sugar-Sweetened Dairy) occurred. Decreases in the Higher-Fat Meat group were significantly (P<0.05) related to decreases in energy intake, percent energy from fat intake, and weight. CONCLUSIONS: When a hypocaloric, low-fat diet is prescribed, reductions in high-fat and/or high-added-sugar food groups occur. Targeting reductions in high-fat meats may improve outcomes.",

However, despite the well-known influence that dietary habits exert over the progression of this disease, there are no well-established and scientifically sound dietary approaches to prevent the onset of clinical outcomes in secondary prevention. The objective of the CORonary Diet Intervention with Olive oil and cardiovascular PREVention study (CORDIOPREV study, clinical trials number NCT00924937) is to compare the ability of a Mediterranean diet rich in virgin olive oil versus a low-fat diet to influence the composite incidence of cardiovascular events after 7 years in subjects with documented CHD at baseline. For this purpose, we enrolled 1,002 coronary patients from Spain. Baseline assessment (2009-2012) included detailed interviews and measurements to assess dietary, social, and biological variables. Results of baseline characteristics: The CORDIOPREV study in Spain describes a population with a high body mass index (37.2% overweight and 56.3% obesity) and with a median of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 88.5 mg/dL (70.6% of the patients having <100 mg/dL and 20.3% patients <70 mg/dL). A total of 9.6% of the participants were active smokers, and 64.4% were former smokers. Metabolic syndrome was present in 58% of this population. To sum up, we describe here the rationale, methods, and baseline characteristics of the CORDIOPREV study, which will test for the first time the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet rich in extra virgin olive oil as compared with a low-fat diet on the incidence of CHD recurrence in a long-term follow-up study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This post hoc analysis determined if the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Diet Modification intervention (DM-I) resulted in a significantly different rate of incident hypertension (HTN), as well as longitudinal changes in blood pressure. METHODS: Participants were 48,835 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years who were randomly assigned to either the intervention or comparison group. HTN was defined as self-report of treated HTN collected semiannually or blood pressure ≥140/90mm Hg at one of the annual follow-up clinic visits. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 8.3 years, and among those who did not have HTN at baseline (n = 31,146), there were 16,174 (51.9%) HTN cases and those assigned to the intervention group had a 4% lower overall risk of developing incident HTN (hazard ratio (HR): 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.99). Although the risk of HTN was lower in the DM-I group in the first few years, the HR became greater than 1 after year 5 (P-trend < 0.01). Similarly, randomization to the DM-I arm resulted in a small but significantly lower average systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 1 year of follow-up (-0.66mm Hg, 0.44-0.89) that increased over the following 8 years (0.16mm Hg/year, 0.11-0.21), such that any early benefit was eliminated by year 5 and a minimal deleterious effect emerged by year 7. CONCLUSION: Randomization to an intensive behavioral dietary modification program aimed at a lower total fat intake is not associated with sustained reductions in blood pressure or risk of HTN in postmenopausal women.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of low-fat diets for long-term weight loss has been debated for decades, with many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and recent reviews giving mixed results. We aimed to summarise the large body of evidence from RCTs to determine whether low-fat diets contribute to greater weight loss than participants' usual diet, low-carbohydrate diets, and other higher-fat dietary interventions. METHODS: We did a systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of RCTs comparing the long-term effect (≥1 year) of low-fat and higher-fat dietary interventions on weight loss by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify eligible trials published from database inception up until July 31, 2014. We excluded trials if one intervention group included a non-dietary weight loss component but the other did not, and trials of dietary supplements or meal replacement drink interventions. Data including the main outcome measure of mean difference in weight change between interventions, and whether interventions were intended to lead to weight loss, weight maintenance, or neither, were extracted from published reports. We estimated the pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) with a DerSimonian and Laird random effects method. FINDINGS: 3517 citations were identified by the search and 53 studies met our inclusion criteria, including 68 128 participants (69 comparisons). In weight loss trials, low-carbohydrate interventions led to significantly greater weight loss than did low-fat interventions (18 comparisons; WMD 1·15 kg [95% CI 0·52 to 1·79]; I(2)=10%). Low-fat interventions did not lead to differences in weight change compared with other higher-fat weight loss interventions (19 comparisons; WMD 0·36 kg [-0·66 to 1·37; I(2)=82%), and led to a greater weight decrease only when compared with a usual diet (eight comparisons; -5·41 kg [-7·29 to -3·54]; I(2)=68%). Similarly, results of non-weight-loss trials and weight maintenance trials, for which no low-carbohydrate comparisons were made, showed that low-fat versus higher-fat interventions have a similar effect on weight loss, and that low-fat interventions led to greater weight loss only when compared with usual diet. In weight loss trials, higher-fat weight loss interventions led to significantly greater weight loss than low-fat interventions when groups differed by more than 5% of calories obtained from fat at follow-up (18 comparisons; WMD 1·04 kg [95% CI 0·06 to 2·03]; I(2)=78%), and when the difference in serum triglycerides between the two interventions at follow-up was at least 0·06 mmol/L (17 comparisons; 1·38 kg [0·50 to 2·25]; I(2)=62%). INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the long-term effect of low-fat diet intervention on bodyweight depends on the intensity of the intervention in the comparison group. When compared with dietary interventions of similar intensity, evidence from RCTs does not support low-fat diets over other dietary interventions for long-term weight loss.

Effects on novel CVD markers remain unclear. We examined the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet (<40 g/day; n = 75) versus a low-fat diet (<30% kcal/day from total fat, <7% saturated fat; n = 73) on biomarkers representing inflammation, adipocyte dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction in a 12 month clinical trial among 148 obese adults free of diabetes and CVD. Participants met with a study dietitian on a periodic basis and each diet group received the same behavioral curriculum which included dietary instruction and supportive counseling. Eighty percent of participants completed the intervention. At 12 months, participants on the low-carbohydrate diet had significantly greater increases in adiponectin (mean difference in change, 1336 ng/mL (95% CI, 342 to 2330 ng/mL); p = 0.009) and greater decreases in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations (-16.8 ng/mL (-32.0 to -1.6 ng/mL); p = 0.031) than those on the low-fat diet. Changes in other novel CVD markers were not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, despite the differences in weight changes on diets, a low-carbohydrate diet resulted in similar or greater improvement in inflammation, adipocyte dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction than a standard low-fat diet among obese persons.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) gene have been associated with cardiometabolic conditions such as obesity and dyslipidemia. Our aim was to examine whether the chronic consumption of two healthy diets interacts with SNPs of the CLOCK gene in order to improve lipid metabolism and inflammation status in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: The diets were low-fat (LF) diet and Mediterranean diet (MedDiet). CLOCK SNPs (rs1801260, rs3749474, rs4580704) and the study procedures were performed in 897 patients from the CORDIOPREV clinical trial. After 12 months of intervention, we found significant gene-diet interactions between rs4580704 SNP and the LF diet. Specifically, major allele carriers C/C displayed a greater decrease in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and a significant increase in HDL/apolipoprotein A1 ratio (p = 0.029) than minor G allele carriers (G/G + C/G). No other gene-diet interactions were observed in this research. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that rs4580704 SNP interacts with the LF diet improving inflammation status and dyslipidemia related with CHD. The shift toward \"personalized nutrition\" based on gene-nutrient interactions may be suitable for promoting cardiovascular health in patients with CHD.",

In this pilot randomized clinical trial, we challenged the conventional low-carbohydrate/higher-fat (LC/CONV) diet, hypothesizing that a higher-complex carbohydrate/lower-fat (CHOICE) diet would improve maternal insulin resistance (IR), adipose tissue (AT) lipolysis, and infant adiposity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At 31 weeks, 12 diet-controlled overweight/obese women with GDM were randomized to an isocaloric LC/CONV (40% carbohydrate/45% fat/15% protein; n = 6) or CHOICE (60%/25%/15%; n = 6) diet. All meals were provided. AT was biopsied at 37 weeks. RESULTS: After ∼7 weeks, fasting glucose (P = 0.03) and free fatty acids (P = 0.06) decreased on CHOICE, whereas fasting glucose increased on LC/CONV (P = 0.03). Insulin suppression of AT lipolysis was improved on CHOICE versus LC/CONV (56 vs. 31%, P = 0.005), consistent with improved IR. AT expression of multiple proinflammatory genes was lower on CHOICE (P < 0.01). Infant adiposity trended lower with CHOICE (10.1 ± 1.4 vs. 12.6 ± 2%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A CHOICE diet may improve maternal IR and infant adiposity, challenging recommendations for a LC/CONV diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is correlated with obesity, but specific therapeutic interventions are lacking. Adiponectin is an adipokine with anti-inflammatory activity and is considered a hepatic protector. We aimed to investigate effects of a low-fat diet on the hepatic expression of adiponectin and its receptors in rats with NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen male SD rats were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks (HFD1 group) or 16 weeks (HFD2 group) to induce NAFLD, and these rats were compared with rats on a normal diet for 8 weeks (NC1 group) or 16 weeks (NC2 group). Another group of 8 rats was fed an HFD for 8 weeks and then switched to a low-fat diet (DIET group) until the 16th week. The expression of hepatic adiponectin and its receptors was detected by western blotting, immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The NAFLD activity score (NAS) in the HFD groups increased from 3.2 ± 0.45 (8th week) to 6.2 ± 0.84 (16th week) (P < 0.001), reflecting the progression in the NAFLD histology. In contrast to the HFD2 group, the low-fat diet ameliorated the steatosis, ballooning degeneration and inflammation. Dietary intervention augmented the expression of adiponectin and its receptors, which was down-regulated in the HFD2 group. CONCLUSIONS: The NAFLD rat model was successfully developed by feeding the animals a high-fat diet. Adiponectin may play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, especially in the progression from steatosis to NASH. The low-fat diet alleviated the histological lesions associated with NAFLD by up-regulating the expression of adiponectin and its receptors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There is convincing evidence that unsaturated fatty acids exert favourable effects on plasma cholesterol levels. However, it is not clear which type of oil has the most pronounced effect, especially not in paediatric patients. The aim was to compare two low-fat diet regimes enriched with either monounsaturated fatty acids by rapeseed oil (RO) or polyunsaturated fatty acids by sunflower oil (SO) in children affected with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-one children aged 6-18 years affected with FH were enrolled in this randomized and double-blind pilot trial. The subjects and their families were trained to adhere to a low-fat/low-cholesterol diet. All visible fats were to be replaced by either RO or SO (14-27 g/day) for 13 weeks. Dietary adherence was controlled by repeated 4-day dietary records; plasma lipids, lipoproteins and risk markers were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Out of 21 subjects, 16 could be followed-up after 6 months. RESULTS: Both fat-modified diets resulted in significant reduction in total cholesterol concentrations of 9.4% (RO P<0.005 vs SO P<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations of 12.7% (P<0.005) for RO and 11.3% (P<0.05) for SO. The reduction of the LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio (RO 9% vs SO 3.5%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (RO 16.8% vs SO 1.7%) were not statistically significant, respectively. In most participating families, a change in eating habits could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: A fat-modified diet enriched with RO seems to have very similar effects on cholesterol levels as with SO. However, our study suggests that RO has possibly more favourable effects concerning cardiovascular risk profile. Both diets appear to be feasible and were well accepted among our subjects. Although these results are promising, larger trials will be required to validate our findings.",

To describe different aspects of taking part in the intervention following the LFD or LCD. METHODS: Prospective, randomized trial of 61 adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The SF-36 questionnaire was used at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months. Patients on LFD aimed for 55-60 energy percent (E%) and those on LCD for 20 E% from carbohydrates. The patients were interviewed about their experiences of the intervention. RESULTS: Mean body-mass-index was 32.7 ± 5.4 kg/m(2) at baseline. Weight-loss did not differ between groups and was maximal at 6 months, LFD: -3.99 ± 4.1 kg, LCD: -4.31 ± 3.6 kg (p<0.001 within groups). There was an increase in the physical component score of SF-36 from 44.1 (10.0) to 46.7 (10.5) at 12 months in the LCD group (p < 0.009) while no change occurred in the LFD group (p < 0.03 between groups). At 12 months the physical function, bodily pain and general health scores improved within the LCD group (p values 0.042-0.009) while there was no change within the LFD group. CONCLUSIONS: Weight-changes did not differ between the diet groups while improvements in HRQoL only occurred after one year during treatment with LCD. No changes of HRQoL occurred in the LFD group in spite of a similar reduction in body weight.",

However, there remains limited evidence about causality from intervention studies. An effective diet for prevention of periodontal disease has not been well established. The current study was an intervention study examining the effects of a high-fiber, low-fat diet on periodontal disease markers in high-risk subjects. Forty-seven volunteers were interviewed for recruitment into the study. Twenty-one volunteers with a body mass index of at least 25.0 kg/m(2) or with impaired glucose tolerance were enrolled in the study. After a 2- to 3-week run-in period, subjects were provided with a test meal consisting of high fiber and low fat (30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight) 3 times a day for 8 weeks and followed by a regular diet for 24 weeks. Four hundred twenty-five teeth from 17 subjects were analyzed. Periodontal disease markers assessed as probing depth (2.28 vs 2.21 vs 2.13 mm; P < .0001), clinical attachment loss (6.11 vs 6.06 vs 5.98 mm; P < .0001), and bleeding on probing (16.2 vs 13.2 vs 14.6 %; P = .005) showed significant reductions after the test-meal period, and these improvements persisted until the follow-up period. Body weight (P < .0001), HbA1c (P < .0001), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = .038) levels showed improvement after the test-meal period; they returned to baseline levels after the follow-up period. In conclusion, treatment with a high-fiber, low-fat diet for 8 weeks effectively improved periodontal disease markers as well as metabolic profiles, at least in part, by effects other than the reduction of total energy intake.",

METHODS: One hundred and thirty male rats randomly assigned to 2 groups: Control (CON)-10 rats consuming a low-fat diet; HFD-120 rats consuming a high-fat diet (HFD). The dietary regimen was sustained for 8 wk, at which point the 40 HFD group rats gaining the most weight were referred to as the obese rats. Glucose tolerance was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the procedure of OGTT, the blood was drawn for insulin assay (insulin release test). The whole body insulin resistance was assessed by glucose-insulin index. The obese HFD group rats were randomized into one of four intervention groups: HFD-sedentary (HFD-SED), HFD-exercise(HFD-EX), low fat diet-SED (LFD-SED), LFD-EX. Ex rats performed 8-wk exercise training on a motorized treadmill. The CON group had access to low-fat diet for another 8 wk. After 8 wk of exercise and low-fat diet intervention, the OGTT and insulin release test were performed again. To use ELISA technique for detecting TNF-alpha in soleus muscle and adipose tissue. RESULTS: After being fed high-fat diet for 8 wk, glucose-insulin index in the HFD group were significantly greater than that in CON group (P < 0.01). After 8-week exercise and low-fat diet intervention, glucose-insulin index in HFD-SED group was significantly greater than that in CON group (P < 0.01). The index in three intervention groups was significantly less than that in HFD-SED group (P < 0.01) . TNF-alpha content in adipose tissue and the soleus muscle for HFD-SED group was significantly greater than that in CON group (P < 0.01). Three intervention groups were significantly less than HFD-SED group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Exercise and low-fat diet interventions can decrease the TNF-alpha expression in insulin resistance rat.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment options are primarily limited to immunomodulatory therapies in MS non-progressive forms. Nutrition intervention studies suggest that diet may be considered as a complementary treatment to control disease progression. Therefore, dietary intervention may help to improve wellness and ameliorate symptoms of MS patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of a low-fat diet with antioxidant supplementation on biochemical markers of institutionalized patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. METHODS: A randomized prospective placebo-controlled study involving 9 participants, 5 of them assigned to the intervention group (low-fat diet and antioxidant supplementation) and the other 4 to the placebo group (low-fat diet). The effect of the dietary intervention, involving diet modification and antioxidant supplementation, was examined for 42 days by measuring anthropometric, biochemical parameters and oxidative stress markers in blood at baseline (day 0), intermediate (day 15) and end (day 42) stages of the treatment. RESULTS: The intervention group obtained C reactive protein levels significantly lower than those observed in the corresponding placebo group at the end of the study. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers isoprostane 8-iso-PGF2α and interleukine IL-6 values also diminished after dietary intervention in the intervention group. Catalase activity increased significantly in the intervention group prior antioxidant supplementation. No significant differences were observed in other oxidative stress markers. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that diet and dietary supplements are involved in cell metabolism modulation and MS-related inflammatory processes. Consequently, low fat diets and antioxidant supplements may be used as complementary therapies for treatment of multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Diet is important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and it has been suggested that a high-MUFA diet is more cardioprotective than a low-fat diet. We hypothesised that the postprandial thrombotic risk profile is improved most favourably by a high-MUFA diet compared with a low-fat diet. This was tested in a parallel intervention trial on overweight individuals (aged 28.4 (SD 4.7) years) randomly assigned to a MUFA-diet (35-45% of energy as fat; >20% as MUFA, n = 21) or a low-fat (LF) diet (20-30% of energy as fat, n = 22) for 6 months after a weight loss of ~10%. All foods were provided free of charge from a purpose-built supermarket. Meal tests designed after the same principles were performed before and after the dietary intervention, and blood samples were collected at 8.00 h (fasting), 12.00 h, and 18.00 h and analysed for factor VII coagulant activity (FVII:C), activated FVII, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI:Ag), and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. There were significant postprandial increases in F1 + 2 and D-dimer before and after dietary intervention, with significantly lower values after 6 months. No significant differences were observed between the postprandial changes induced by the two diets. The postprandial decrease in FVII:C and PAI:Ag did not differ before and after intervention, irrespective of the diets. Our findings suggest postprandial coagulation activation in overweight subjects with more pronounced acute than long-term effects. We observed similar effects of the MUFA diet and the LF diet on the postprandial prothrombotic risk profile.",

      "abstract": "Genetic variation at the Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) locus has been associated with lifestyle-related conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular diseases. In fact, it has been suggested that the disruption of the circadian system may play a causal role in manifestations of MetS. The aim of this research was to find out whether habitual consumption of a low-fat diet, compared with a Mediterranean diet enriched with olive oil, modulates the associations between common CLOCK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1801260, rs3749474 and rs4580704) and lipid and glucose-related traits among MetS patients. Plasma lipid and insulin concentrations, indexes related with insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)) and CLOCK SNPs were determined in 475 MetS subjects participating in the CORDIOPREV clinical trial (NCT00924937). Gene-diet interactions were analyzed after a year of dietary intervention (Mediterranean diet (35% fat, 22% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)) versus low-fat diet (28% fat, 12% MUFA)). We found significant gene-diet interactions between rs1801260 SNP and the dietary pattern for insulin concentrations (p = 0.009), HOMA-IR (p = 0.014) and QUICKI (p = 0.028). Specifically, after 12 months of low-fat intervention, subjects who were homozygous for the major allele (TT) displayed lower plasma insulin concentrations (p = 0.032), lower insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p = 0.027) and higher insulin sensitivity (QUICKI; p = 0.024) compared with carriers of the minor allele C (TC + CC). In contrast, in the Mediterranean intervention group a different trend was observed although no significant differences were found between CLOCK genotypes after 12 months of treatment. Our data support the notion that a chronic consumption of a healthy diet may play a contributing role in triggering glucose metabolism by interacting with the rs1801260 SNP at CLOCK gene locus in MetS patients. Due to the complex nature of gene-environment interactions, dietary adjustment in subjects with the MetS may require a personalized approach.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our experience of iatrogenic chylothorax after pulmonary resection for primary lung cancer to evaluate a low-fat diet management strategy. METHODS: From October 2003 to March 2010, 1580 patients underwent lobectomy or greater resection and systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection for primary lung cancer at our institution. Chylothorax was diagnosed on the basis of chylous leakage from the chest tube and was confirmed by presence of triglycerides (>110 mg/dL) in the drainage fluid. We initially treated the patients with chylothorax conservatively with a low-fat diet (fat intake <10 g/day). If chest tube drainage produced >500 mL of chylous fluid during the first 24 hours after the initiation of the low-fat diet, surgical intervention was performed. If chest tube drainage produced >300 mL/day of chylous fluid after 3 days of a low-fat diet, we performed pleurodesis by injecting a preparation of OK-432, a penicillin-treated lyophilized preparation of a Streptococcus strain into the thoracic cavity through a chest tube. RESULTS: Postoperative chylothorax developed in 37 patients (2.3%), 33 men and 4 women, with a median age of 69 years (range, 44-84). The initial procedures were pneumonectomy in 1 patient and lobectomy in 36 patients. In 23 patients (62%), their condition resolved with the low-fat diet only. A total of 10 patients underwent OK-432 pleurodesis, and 8 of these were cured with continuation of the low-fat diet. These 31 patients who responded to conservative treatment (84%) resumed a normal diet at a median of 10 days (range, 5-27) after the chylothorax diagnosis. The remaining 6 patients (16%) underwent reoperation and were discharged at a median of 18 days (range, 14-33) after the initial surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A low-fat diet and OK-432 pleurodesis achieved positive results in >80% of patients with chylothorax after pulmonary resection with systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection within 4 weeks after the initial surgery. More than 500 mL of chylous fluid during the first 24 hours after the initiation of the low-fat diet was valid as an indication of the need for surgical intervention.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of a low-fat diet, in comparison with participants' usual diet, on serum lipids in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. METHODS: Ten electronic databases were searched for relevant articles reporting randomized controlled trials through August 31, 2012, including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, SinoMed, CNKI (Chinese database), and WanFang (Chinese database). This systematic review and meta-analysis, which evaluated the effects of a low-fat diet, in comparison with the participants' usual diet, was conducted according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. All analyses were performed using RevMan version 5 (Cochrane Collaboration). RESULTS: From 512 potentially relevant publication citations reviewed, 8 randomized clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis, representing 22 groups (11 intervention groups and 11 control groups). A total of 1,536 women (900 in the intervention group and 636 in the control group) met the inclusion criteria. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values changed more favorably in participants randomized to low-fat diets than in participants randomized to their usual diets. Low-fat diet was found to induce significant reductions in TC (random-effects model: mean difference [MD], -0.49 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.29; I = 42%; Peffect < 0.00001), HDL-C (MD, -0.12 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.05; I = 49%; Peffect = 0.00006), and LDL-C (MD, -0.24 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.38 to -0.09; I = 42%; Peffect = 0.001) for two groups. For subgroup analysis, low-fat diet was efficacious in reducing TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C in premenopausal women but did not significantly reduce the same outcomes in postmenopausal women. However, there were also no statistically significant differences in triglycerides (TG) and TC-to-HDL-C ratio between a low-fat diet and the participants' usual diet (TG: MD, 0.04 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.11; I = 0%; Peffect = 0.16; TC-to-HDL-C ratio: MD, 0.08 mmol/L; 95%, CI -0.21 to 0.36; I = 0%; Peffect = 0.59) in two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall results suggest that a low-fat diet is efficacious in reducing the concentrations of TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C but not in reducing TG and TC-to-HDL-C ratio in women. A low-fat diet is efficacious in reducing TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C in premenopausal women. Additional studies are needed to further address its effects on postmenopausal women.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatty liver is highly prevalent among obese children and represents a major risk factor for chronic liver diseases and severe metabolic complications. METHODS: We randomly assigned 17 obese children 8-17 years of age with fatty liver to either an experimental low-glycemic-load or conventional low-fat diet for 6 months. Participants in both groups received nutrition education and behavioral counseling of equal intensity. The primary outcome was hepatic lipid content measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Secondary outcomes included change in visceral fat, BMI, anthropometrics, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and insulin resistance. RESULTS: A total of 16 participants completed the study. Reported glycemic load decreased in the low-glycemic-load group and reported dietary fat decreased in the low-fat group. At baseline, liver fat was 23.8% [standard deviation (SD) 12.2] in the low-glycemic-load group and 29.3% (14.1) in the low-fat group. Liver fat decreased substantially in both groups at 6 months expressed as absolute percentage change, with no between-group differences [-8.8 (standard error (SE) 4.1) vs. -10.5 (3.7)%, respectively, p=0.76 for group×time interaction]. Secondary outcomes also improved on both diets, with no between-group differences. Baseline and change in ALT were strongly associated with hepatic fat content. CONCLUSIONS: Weight-reducing diets focused either on glycemic load or dietary fat improved hepatic steatosis over 6 months. Additional research is needed to determine whether these diets differ in effectiveness over the long term. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00480922.",

In animal studies, skin tumor development has been reduced by low-fat diet. We evaluated the effect of a low-fat dietary pattern on NMSC and melanoma in the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification trial. METHODS: Postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years (n = 48,835) were randomly assigned to the low-fat dietary pattern intervention (n = 19,541) or comparison group (n = 29,294). The intervention goals included decreasing fat intake to 20% or less of calories, increasing vegetable and fruit intake, and increasing grain intake. Self-reported incident NMSC (n = 4,907) and physician-adjudicated incident melanoma (n = 279) were ascertained every 6 months. RESULTS: Over 8.1 years of follow-up, the low-fat diet intervention did not affect overall incidence of NMSC [HR 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92-1.04] or melanoma (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82-1.32). In subgroup analyses of melanoma risk, baseline fat intake interacted significantly with group assignment (Pinteraction = 0.006). Among women with higher baseline fat intake, the dietary intervention significantly increased risk (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.06-2.07), whereas, among women with lower baseline fat intake, the intervention tended to reduce melanoma risk (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this large randomized trial, a low-fat dietary pattern did not affect overall incidence of NMSC or melanoma. IMPACT: A low-fat diet does not reduce incidence of NMSC, but an interaction between baseline fat intake and dietary intervention on melanoma risk warrants further investigation.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a low-fat diet on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats previously fed a high-fat diet. METHODS: Male rats were randomly assigned to consume a Western diet or a low-fat diet for 6 weeks. Western diet-fed rats were then further randomized to switch to the low-fat diet (WD-LF) or continue with the Western diet (WD). One week later, WD-LF and WD received 1 mg/kg DOX per day for 10 consecutive days and continued with their diets (WD-LF + DOX, WD + DOX). LF was further randomized to receive 1 mg/kg DOX per day for 10 consecutive days (LF + DOX) or saline injections as a control (LF + SAL). Four weeks following the first injection, cardiac function was analyzed, and left ventricles were analyzed for cardiotoxicity indices. RESULTS: When compared to LF + SAL and LF + DOX, WD + DOX exhibited an enhanced cardiotoxicity as evidenced by reduced septal wall thickness, fractional shortening, and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase expression as well as increased left ventricular cavity dimensions, lipid peroxidation, and β-myosin heavy-chain expression. This exacerbated cardiotoxicity was not observed in WD-LF + DOX. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to a low-fat diet 1 week prior to, during, and following DOX treatment attenuated the exacerbated cardiotoxicity observed in the previously Western diet-fed rats.",

OBJECTIVE: To report on the effect of orlistat in siblings with severe inherited hyperchylomicronemia and to assess posttreatment lipoprotein concentrations and composition. METHODS: Serial observations of plasma lipid levels and hospitalizations after treatment with orlistat and lipoprotein studies on a single fasting posttreatment sample. RESULTS: The affected siblings inherited a lipoprotein lipase gene mutation from each of their parents: a novel mutation from their father (c.542G > C, p.G181R) and a known missense mutation from their mother (c.644G > A, p.G215E). When the boy presented to us at age 9 years of age and his sister at age 7 years, we found that addition of orlistat, a pancreatic lipase inhibitor, at a dose of 120 mg given before three low-fat meals a day was effective in reducing episodes of pancreatitis in the boy and in maintaining the triglyceride at lower levels in both children. During treatment, the children were observed to have elevations in apolipoprotein (apo)B, low-density lipoprotein particle concentration, abnormal apoB-containing subclasses, and deficiencies in apoA-I and apoA-II-containing lipoproteins, changes consistent with continuing increased cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSION: The data support the need for more effective long-term treatments that not only prevent pancreatitis but also offset cardiovascular risk. Orlistat can be considered effective in augmenting the effect of a low-fat diet and reducing risk for pancreatitis.",

The aim was to compare the long-term effects of high-protein vs. high-carbohydrate diet (HPD, HCD), combined with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized trial, 88 obese participants (mean age, 46.7; mean BMI, 45.6 kg m(-2) ) were enrolled in a 3-week inpatient and 48-week outpatient treatment, with continuous CBT during the study period. All subjects consumed a restricted diet (1,200 kcal day(-1) for women, 1,500 for men; 20% energy from fat, <10% saturated fat). HPD derived 34% energy from proteins, 46% from carbohydrates; HCD 17% from proteins, 64% from carbohydrates. The primary outcome was 1-year percent weight loss. Secondary outcomes were attrition rates and changes in cardiovascular risk factors and psychological profile. RESULTS: Attrition rates were similar between groups (25.6%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, weight loss averaged 15.0% in HPD and 13.3% in HCD at 1 year, without any difference throughout the study period. Both diets produced a similar improvement in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The relative carbohydrate and protein content of the diet, when combined with intensive CBT, does not significantly affect attrition rate, weight loss and psychosocial outcome in patients with severe obesity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Omega-3 (OM-3) fatty acid products are indicated for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia; however, the omega-3-acid ethyl ester (OM-3 EE) formulations require significant pancreatic lipase stimulation with high-fat meals for adequate intestinal absorption of the metabolites eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A novel omega-3 free fatty acid (OM-3 FFA) formulation (Epanova(®), Omthera Pharmaceuticals Inc., Princeton, NJ) was developed to maximize EPA and DHA bioavailability during a low-fat diet. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative bioavailability of EPA and DHA from single 4-gram doses of OM-3 FFA and a prescription OM-3 EE (Lovaza(®), GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC). METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label, single dose, 4-way crossover, bioavailability study of OM-3 FFA and OM-3 EE administered during periods of low-fat and high-fat consumption to 54 overweight adults. Bioavailability was determined by the ln-transformed area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC(0-t)) during a 24-hour interval for EPA and DHA (baseline-adjusted). RESULTS: The baseline-adjusted AUC(0-t) for total EPA + DHA during the low-fat period was 4.0-fold greater with OM-3 FFA compared with OM-3 EE (2650.2 vs 662.0 nmol·h/mL, respectively; P < .0001). During the high-fat period, AUC(0-t) for OM-3 FFA was approximately 1.3-fold greater than OM-3 EE (P < .0001). During the low-fat period, 30 of 51 (58.8%) subjects dosed with OM-3 FFA maintained an AUC(0-t) that was ≥50% of the respective high-fat AUC(0-t) in contrast to only 3 of 50 (6.0%) subjects dosed with OM-3 EE. CONCLUSIONS: During a low-fat consumption period, the OM-3 FFA formulation provided dramatically improved bioavailability over the OM-3 EE formulation in overweight subjects. These findings offer a potential therapeutic advantage of the OM-3 FFA formulation for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia as these patients are expected to adhere to a low-fat diet.",

METHODS: Patients with unknown cause of upper abdominal pain suggesting pancreatic disease without a history of alcohol consumption were prescribed a low-fat diet (<20 g of fat/d) for 4 weeks. Based on endoscopic ultrasonographic findings and the Rosemont criteria, the patients were distributed into those with 5 or more minor features of chronic pancreatitis (suggestive group), those with 3 or 4 (indeterminate group), and those with 2 or less (control group). Patients with major features were excluded. Symptom severity was recorded before and after the diet therapy using a 10-cm visual analog scale. Improvement of symptoms was compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: Of 45 patients, 14 were in the suggestive group, 18 were in the indeterminate group, and 13 served as controls. Improvement of visual analog scale score was significantly greater in the suggestive group than in the indeterminate group (P < 0.001) and the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A low-fat diet may be effective in patients with dyspepsia associated with endosonographic evidence of mild pancreatic disease, who do not habitually drink alcohol.",

We hypothesized that a low-fat diet combined with IGF-1R blockade would cause additive inhibition of prostate cancer growth and offset possible untoward metabolic effects of IGF-1R blockade antibody therapy. Fifty severe combined immunodeficient mice were injected with 22Rv1 cells subcutaneously. Ten days postinjection, the animals were randomized to four groups: (i) high-fat diet + saline (HF); (ii) high-fat diet + IGF-1R blocking antibody, ganitumab (HF/Ab); (iii) low-fat diet + saline (LF); and (iv) low-fat diet + ganitumab (LF/Ab). After 19 days of treatment, the animals were euthanized, serum was collected, and tumors were weighed. Tumor Ki67, Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, serum insulin, IGF-I and TNF-α were measured. In vitro, ganitumab treatment inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in several prostate cancer cell lines. In vivo, tumor weights and volumes were unaffected by the different treatments. The LF/Ab therapy significantly reduced proliferation (Ki67) and ERK activation in tumors. The HF/Ab group had significantly higher serum insulin levels than the HF group. However, LF/Ab combination significantly reduced serum insulin back to normal levels as well as normalizing serum TNF-α level. Whereas the combination of low-fat diet and IGF-1R blockade did not have additive inhibitory effects on tumor weight, it led to reduced tumor cell proliferation and a reduction in serum insulin and TNF-α levels.",

METHODS: This was a prospective randomised parallel trial involving 61 adults with type 2 diabetes consecutively recruited in primary care and randomised by drawing ballots. Patients that did not speak Swedish could not be recruited. The primary outcomes in this non-blinded study were weight and HbA(1c). Patients on the LFD aimed for 55-60 energy per cent (E%) and those on LCD for 20 E% from carbohydrate. RESULTS: The mean BMI and HbA(1c) of the participants were 32.7 ± 5.4 kg/m(2) and 57.0 ± 9.2 mmol/mol, respectively. No patients were lost to follow-up. Weight loss did not differ between groups and was maximal at 6 months: LFD -3.99 ± 4.1 kg (n=31); LCD -4.31 ± 3.6 kg (n=30); p < 0.001 within groups. At 24 months, patients on the LFD had lost -2.97 ± 4.9 kg and those on LCD -2.34 ± 5.1 kg compared with baseline (p = 0.002 and p = 0.020 within groups, respectively). HbA(1c) fell in the LCD group only (LCD at 6 months -4.8 ± 8.3 mmol/mol, p = 0.004, at 12 months -2.2 ± 7.7 mmol/mol, p = 0.12; LFD at 6 months -0.9 ± 8.8 mmol/mol, p = 0.56). At 6 months, HDL-cholesterol had increased with the LCD (from 1.13 ± 0.33 mmol/l to 1.25 ± 0.47 mmol/l, p = 0.018) while LDL-cholesterol did not differ between groups. Insulin doses were reduced in the LCD group (0 months, LCD 42 ± 65 E, LFD 39 ± 51 E; 6 months, LCD 30 ± 47 E, LFD 38 ± 48 E; p = 0.046 for between-group change). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Weight changes did not differ between the diet groups, while insulin doses were reduced significantly more with the LCD at 6 months, when compliance was good. Thus, aiming for 20% of energy intake from carbohydrates is safe with respect to cardiovascular risk compared with the traditional LFD and this approach could constitute a treatment alternative.

METHODS: After on a washout diet for seven days, fifty six healthy young subjects were given the HC/LF diet for six days. The 12 hour-fasting serum lipids and apolipoproteins (apo) AI and B100 were measured on the 1st, the 8th and the 14th days. The ratios of TG/HDL-C, log (TG/HDL-C), TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C and apoAI/apoB100 were calculated. The polymorphism of Gln27Glu was analyzed by PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: No significant differences were found of the lipid and apolipoprotein ratios at baseline and before the HC/LF diet between the subjects with the CC genotype (wide type) and the G carriers (mutation carriers) in the whole study sample or the males and the females separately. The G carriers had a significantly higher level of log (TG/HDL-C) (P=0.038) than the subjects with the CC genotype did after the HC/LF diet in the whole study sample but not in the males and the females separately. Significant decreases of LDL-C/HDL-C and TC/HDL-C were observed in all the subjects after the HC/LF diet when compared with those before the HC/LF diet (P<0.05), but a significant increase of apoAI/apoB100 (P=0.021) only in the subjects with the CC genotype. When gender was taken into account, significant decreases of LDL-C/HDL-C and TC/HDL-C were found after the HC/ LF diet in the male subjects regardless of genotypes (P<0.05). Significant increases of TG/HDL-C and log (TG/ HDL-C) and a significant decrease of TC/HDL-C were found in all the female subjects (P<0.05), while a significant decrease of LDL-C/HDL-C (P=0.037) was only observed in the female subjects with the CC genotype. CONCLUSION: The G allele of beta2AR Gln27Glu variation can inhibit the decrease of LDL-C/HDL-C in females after HC/LF diet intervention.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical studies suggest lowering dietary fat and decreasing the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decreases the risk of prostate cancer development and progression. We conducted a phase II randomized trial to test the effect of decreasing dietary fat combined with decreasing the dietary omega-6:omega-3 ratio on biomarkers related to prostate cancer development and progression. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were randomly assigned to receive a low-fat diet with 5 grams of fish oil daily (dietary omega-6:omega-3 ratio of 2:1) or a control Western diet (omega-6:omega-3 ratio of 15:1) for four to six weeks prior to surgery. The primary endpoint was change in serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) between arms. Secondary endpoints were serum IGFBP-1, prostate prostaglandin E2 levels, omega-6:omega-3 fatty acid ratios, COX-2, and markers of proliferation and apoptosis. Fifty-five patients were randomized and 48 completed the trial. There was no treatment difference in the primary outcome. Positive secondary outcomes in the low-fat fish oil versus Western group were reduced benign and malignant prostate tissue omega-6:omega-3 ratios, reduced proliferation (Ki-67 index), and reduced proliferation in an ex vivo bioassay when patient sera was applied to prostate cancer cells in vitro. In summary, four to six weeks of a low-fat diet and fish oil capsules to achieve an omega-6:omega-3 fatty acid ratio of 2:1 had no effect on serum IGF-1 levels, though in secondary analyses, the intervention resulted in decreased prostate cancer proliferation and decreased prostate tissue omega-6:omega-3 ratios. These results support further studies evaluating reduction of dietary fat with fish oil supplementation on modulating prostate cancer biology.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Results of the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial (WHI-DM) suggest that a low-fat diet may be associated with beneficial health outcomes for specific groups of women. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to assess how cost-effective the WHI-DM would be if implemented as a public health intervention and under the sponsorship of private health insurers and Medicare. Breast and ovarian cancers are the health outcomes of interest. PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of WHI-DM participants form the target population for this analysis: participants consuming >36.8% of energy from fat at baseline, and participants at high risk for breast cancer with 32% or more of energy from fat at baseline. METHODS: This study uses Markov cohort modeling, following societal and health care payer perspectives, with Monte Carlo simulations and one-way sensitivity analyses. WHI-DM records, nationally representative prices, and published estimates of medical care costs were the sources of cost information. Simulations were performed for hypothetical cohorts of women aged 50, 55, 60, 65, or 70 years at the beginning of the intervention. Effectiveness was estimated by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Following the societal perspective, the ICERs for the 50-year old cohort are $13,773/QALY (95% confidence interval $7,482 to $20,916) for women consuming >36.8% of energy from fat at baseline and $10,544/QALY ($2,096 to $23,673) for women at high risk for breast cancer. The comparable ICER from a private health care payer perspective is $66,059/QALY ($30,155 to $121,087) and from a Medicare perspective, it is $15,051/QALY ($6,565 to $25,105). CONCLUSIONS: The WHI-DM is a cost-effective strategy for the prevention of breast and ovarian cancers in the target population, from both societal and Medicare perspectives. Private health care payers have a relative short timeframe to realize a return on investment, since after age 65 years the financial benefits associated with the prevention program would accrue to Medicare. For this reason, the intervention is not cost-effective from a private health care payer perspective.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the recognition of obesity in young people as a key health issue, there is limited evidence to inform health professionals regarding the most appropriate treatment options. The Eat Smart study aims to contribute to the knowledge base of effective dietary strategies for the clinical management of the obese adolescent and examine the cardiometablic effects of a reduced carbohydrate diet versus a low fat diet. METHODS AND DESIGN: Eat Smart is a randomised controlled trial and aims to recruit 100 adolescents over a 2 1/2 year period. Families will be invited to participate following referral by their health professional who has recommended weight management. Participants will be overweight as defined by a body mass index (BMI) greater than the 90th percentile, using CDC 2000 growth charts. An accredited 6-week psychological life skills program 'FRIENDS for Life', which is designed to provide behaviour change and coping skills will be undertaken prior to volunteers being randomised to group. The intervention arms include a structured reduced carbohydrate or a structured low fat dietary program based on an individualised energy prescription. The intervention will involve a series of dietetic appointments over 24 weeks. The control group will commence the dietary program of their choice after a 12 week period. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, week 12 and week 24. The primary outcome measure will be change in BMI z-score. A range of secondary outcome measures including body composition, lipid fractions, inflammatory markers, social and psychological measures will be measured. DISCUSSION: The chronic and difficult nature of treating the obese adolescent is increasingly recognised by clinicians and has highlighted the need for research aimed at providing effective intervention strategies, particularly for use in the tertiary setting. A structured reduced carbohydrate approach may provide a dietary pattern that some families will find more sustainable and effective than the conventional low fat dietary approach currently advocated. This study aims to investigate the acceptability and effectiveness of a structured reduced dietary carbohydrate intervention and will compare the outcomes of this approach with a structured low fat eating plan. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this study is registered with the International Clinical Trials Registry (ISRCTN49438757).",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of 2-year treatment with a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, each of which was combined with a comprehensive lifestyle modification program. DESIGN: Randomized parallel-group trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00143936) SETTING: 3 academic medical centers. PATIENTS: 307 participants with a mean age of 45.5 years (SD, 9.7 years) and mean body mass index of 36.1 kg/m(2) (SD, 3.5 kg/m(2)). INTERVENTION: A low-carbohydrate diet, which consisted of limited carbohydrate intake (20 g/d for 3 months) in the form of low-glycemic index vegetables with unrestricted consumption of fat and protein. After 3 months, participants in the low-carbohydrate diet group increased their carbohydrate intake (5 g/d per wk) until a stable and desired weight was achieved. A low-fat diet consisted of limited energy intake (1200 to 1800 kcal/d; <or=30% calories from fat). Both diets were combined with comprehensive behavioral treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Weight at 2 years was the primary outcome. Secondary measures included weight at 3, 6, and 12 months and serum lipid concentrations, blood pressure, urinary ketones, symptoms, bone mineral density, and body composition throughout the study. RESULTS: Weight loss was approximately 11 kg (11%) at 1 year and 7 kg (7%) at 2 years. There were no differences in weight, body composition, or bone mineral density between the groups at any time point. During the first 6 months, the low-carbohydrate diet group had greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lesser reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and more adverse symptoms than did the low-fat diet group. The low-carbohydrate diet group had greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at all time points, approximating a 23% increase at 2 years. LIMITATION: Intensive behavioral treatment was provided, patients with dyslipidemia and diabetes were excluded, and attrition at 2 years was high. CONCLUSION: Successful weight loss can be achieved with either a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet when coupled with behavioral treatment. A low-carbohydrate diet is associated with favorable changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors at 2 years. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institutes of Health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There is controversy over dietary protein's effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors in diabetic subjects. It is unclear whether observed effects are due to increased protein or reduced carbohydrate content of the consumed diets. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two diets differing in protein to fat ratios on cardiovascular disease risk factors. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 17 obese (body mass index (BMI) ranging from 31 to 45 kg/m(2)) volunteers with type 2 diabetes (DM2), aged 46+/-3 years, consumed two diets, each for 4 weeks, with 3 weeks of washout period in a random, blind, crossover design. The diets were: (1) a high-protein low-fat diet (HP-LF, with 30% protein, 50% carbohydrates and 20% fat) and (2) a low-protein high-fat diet (LP-HF, with 15% protein, 50% carbohydrates and 35% fat). Their effects on fasting glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure, and on postprandial glucose and insulin responses after a standard test meal at the beginning and end of each dietary intervention were analyzed. RESULTS: Both diets were equally effective in promoting weight loss and fat loss and in improving fasting glycemic control, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but the HP-LF diet decreased to a greater extent triglyceride (TG) levels (P=0.04) when compared with the LP-HF diet. HP-LF diet improved significantly both systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with the LP-HF diet (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). No differences were observed in postprandial glucose and insulin responses. CONCLUSIONS: A protein to fat ratio of 1.5 in diets significantly improves blood pressure and TG concentrations in obese individuals with DM2.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Two potent weight loss therapies, a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (LCKD) and orlistat therapy combined with a low-fat diet (O + LFD), are available to the public but, to our knowledge, have never been compared. METHODS: Overweight or obese outpatients (n = 146) from the Department of Veterans Affairs primary care clinics in Durham, North Carolina, were randomized to either LCKD instruction (initially, <20 g of carbohydrate daily) or orlistat therapy, 120 mg orally 3 times daily, plus low-fat diet instruction (<30% energy from fat, 500-1000 kcal/d deficit) delivered at group meetings over 48 weeks. Main outcome measures were body weight, blood pressure, fasting serum lipid, and glycemic parameters. RESULTS: The mean age was 52 years and mean body mass index was 39.3 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); 72% were men, 55% were black, and 32% had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Of the study participants, 57 of the LCKD group (79%) and 65 of the O + LFD group (88%) completed measurements at 48 weeks. Weight loss was similar for the LCKD (expected mean change, -9.5%) and the O + LFD (-8.5%) (P = .60 for comparison) groups. The LCKD had a more beneficial impact than O + LFD on systolic (-5.9 vs 1.5 mm Hg) and diastolic (-4.5 vs 0.4 mm Hg) blood pressures (P < .001 for both comparisons). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels improved similarly within both groups. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels improved within the O + LFD group only, whereas glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A(1c) levels improved within the LCKD group only; comparisons between groups, however, were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In a sample of medical outpatients, an LCKD led to similar improvements as O + LFD for weight, serum lipid, and glycemic parameters and was more effective for lowering blood pressure.

This investigation sought to determine whether comparable results to those of short-term, intensive interventions could be achieved over a 24-month study period using a low-intensity intervention that approximates what is feasible in outpatient practice. A total of 144 obese, diabetic participants were randomly assigned to a low-carbohydrate diet (<30 g/day) or to a low fat diet (<or=30% of calories from fat with a deficit of 500 kcal/day). Participants were provided weekly group nutrition education sessions for the first month, and monthly sessions thereafter through the end of 24 months. Weight, HbA(1c), glucose, and lipids were measured at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. Of the 144 enrolled participants, 68 returned for the month 24 assessment visit. Weights were retrieved from electronic medical records for an additional 57 participants (total, 125 participants) at month 24. All participants with a baseline measurement and at least one of the three other measurements were included in the mixed-model analyses (n = 138). The low-intensity intervention resulted in modest weight loss in both groups at month 24. At this time, participants in the low-carbohydrate group lost 1.5 kg, compared to 0.2 kg in the low-fat group (P = 0.147). Lipids, glycemic indexes, and dietary intake did not differ between groups at month 24 (or at months 6 or 12) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00108459).",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: A high fat Western diet and sedentary lifestyle may predispose men to prostate cancer through changes in serum hormones and growth factors. We evaluated the effect of a low fat diet on serum factors affecting prostate cancer cell growth by performing a prospective, randomized dietary intervention trial in men with prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We randomized 18 men with prostate cancer who did not receive prior therapy to a low fat (15% kcal), high fiber, soy protein supplemented diet or a Western (40% kcal fat) diet for 4 weeks. Fasting serum was collected at baseline and after the intervention to measure prostate specific antigen, sex hormones, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I and II, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, lipids and fatty acids. LNCaP cells (ATCC(R)) were cultured in medium containing pre-intervention and post-intervention human serum to assess the in vitro effect of the diet on prostate cancer cell proliferation. RESULTS: Subjects in each group were highly compliant with the dietary intervention. Serum from men in the low fat group significantly decreased the growth of LNCaP cells relative to Western diet serum (p = 0.03). There were no significant between group changes in serum prostate specific antigen, sex hormones, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I and II, and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins. Serum triglyceride and linoleic acid (omega-6) levels were decreased in the low fat group (p = 0.034 and 0.005, respectively). Correlation analysis revealed that decreased omega-6 and increased omega-3 fatty acid correlated with decreased serum stimulated LNCaP cell growth (r = 0.64, p = 0.004 and r = -0.49, p = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, randomized dietary intervention trial a low fat diet resulted in changes in serum fatty acid levels that were associated with decreased human LNCaP cancer cell growth. Further prospective trials are indicated to evaluate the potential of low fat diets for prostate cancer prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to identify the successful component(s) related to changes in metabolic syndrome (MetS) from lifestyle interventions: the weight loss, the behavior change, or the combination. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a weight-stable randomized controlled trial of low-fat diet and exercise, alone and in combination, on MetS. Men (n = 179) and postmenopausal women (n = 149) with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were randomized into a 1-year, weight-stable trial with four treatment groups: control (C), diet (D), exercise (E), or diet plus exercise (D+E). MetS was defined using a continuous score. Changes in MetS score (DeltaMetS) were compared between groups using analysis of covariance, stratified by gender and using two models, with and without baseline and change in percent body fat (DeltaBF) as a covariate. In men, DeltaMetS was higher for D vs. C (P = 0.04), D+E vs. C (P = 0.0002), and D+E vs. E (P = 0.02). For women, DeltaMetS was greater for D vs. C (P = 0.045), E vs. C (P = 0.02), and D+E vs. C (P = 0.004). After adjusting for DeltaBF, all differences between groups were attenuated and no longer significant. DeltaMetS were associated with DeltaBF for both men (P < 0.0001) and women (P = 0.004). After adjustment for DeltaBF, low-fat diet alone and in combination with exercise had no effect on MetS. The key component for MetS from low-fat diet and/or increased physical activity appears to be body fat loss.",

      "abstract": "Change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) from low-fat diet (diet) and physical activity (PA) interventions is relatively unknown for adults with metabolic syndrome. The objective of the study was to assess CRP change (DeltaCRP) with diet and/or PA in men and women with and without metabolic syndrome. Men (n = 149) and postmenopausal women (n = 125) with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were recruited into a 1-year randomized controlled trial. Treatment groups were as follows: control, diet (reduced total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intake), PA (45-60 minutes at 60%-85% maximum heart rate), or diet + PA. Weight loss was not an intervention focus. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria. Stored plasma samples were analyzed for CRP. Change in CRP was compared between treatments, within sex and metabolic syndrome status, using analysis of covariance, including covariates for baseline CRP and body fat change. For women with metabolic syndrome (n = 39), DeltaCRP was greater in diet vs control (-1.2 +/- 0.4, P = .009), diet + PA vs control (-1.3 +/- 0.4, P = .006), and diet + PA vs PA (-1.1 +/- 0.4, P = .02). Women with metabolic syndrome receiving the diet component (diet or diet + PA) had greater DeltaCRP compared with those who did not (control or PA) (P = .001). Change in CRP was not significantly different between intervention groups in men overall, women overall, men with (n = 47) or without metabolic syndrome (n = 102), or women without metabolic syndrome (n = 86). Low-fat diet may be the most effective treatment for reducing CRP in women with metabolic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The management of Type V hypertriglyceridaemia at some centres involves the use of a very low fat diet (15% energy as fat). There is no published research examining compliance with, or nutritional adequacy, of this treatment. This study assesses the nutritional adequacy of the diet and examines barriers and enablers to adherence. METHODS: Fifty-four eligible patients were invited to take part. Eight males and one female agreed to participate. One male later withdrew. The mean age of participants was 49.4 years (SD 12.9 years), their mean BMI was 30.4 kg m(-2) (SD 3.4 kg m(-2)) and their mean triglyceride level was 8.5 mmol L(-1) (SD 5.6 mmol L(-1)). To assess nutritional adequacy and compliance, 3-day dietary records and telephone based diet histories were used and analysed using CompEat. Patients' experience was investigated using semi-structured telephone based qualitative interviews. Qualitative data was recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis to allow elucidation of emerging themes. RESULTS: Fat accounted for 22.5% of dietary energy and compliance was considered difficult. Barriers included lack of accessible nutritional information, increased patient burden defined as inconvenience and the persistent awareness of potential or actual ill health, lack of appropriate food choices, other peoples' ignorance, lack of flavour and variety, a desire to broaden the palate, cost, social pressure and prior negative experiences with dietitians. Enablers to compliance included nutritional awareness, desire to maintain good health, building on their nutritional knowledge base, behaviour and lifestyle modification, developing a routine, the support of family and friends and supportive eating environments. CONCLUSION: Compliance could be improved through extensive education on labelling, eating during special occasions such as Christmas, birthdays and eating out.",

The study aim was to compare a low glycemic load (LGL) diet versus a low-fat diet in a trial with a moderately intense dietary intervention in subjects with varying degrees of metabolic syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Men and women aged 30-65 years, with a BMI of 28-40 kg/m(2) (28-35 for women) and at least one criterion of metabolic syndrome were randomized to the two diets. A total of 202 subjects were included, of which 126 (62%) had metabolic syndrome (>or=3 criteria). The completion rate was 81%. At 3 months, weight loss was greater in the LGL group (-4.8+/-3.9 kg versus -3.8+/-3.5 kg; P=0.06) compared to the low-fat group. At 1 year, however, weight loss was similar in both groups (-4.0+/-5.5 kg versus -4.3+/-6.2 kg; n.s.), but waist circumference reduction was less in the LGL group (-3.9+/-5.3 cm versus -5.8+/-6.8 cm; P=0.03). In contrast, diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly more in the LGL group (-4.0+/-8.7 mmHg versus -1.1+/-8.5 mmHg; P=0.02). We also observed a significant interaction between the presence of the metabolic syndrome and the effect of the two diets on waist circumference, with a less favorable effect of the LGL diet in subjects without the syndrome (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: After 12 months, both diets reduced body weight and the metabolic disturbances similarly, but the LGL diet appeared more suitable for subjects with metabolic syndrome, and was less effective in those without it.",

The aim was to compare the effects on bone turnover of a low-Na base-producing (LNAB) Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet (including six serves lean red meat/week) with a high-carbohydrate low-fat (HCLF) diet with a higher acid load (both >800 mg dietary Ca/d). Fasting serum bone markers (baseline and week 14) and 24 h urinary electrolyte excretion (baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12 and 14) were measured. After the intervention period, the LNAB group (n 46) had a fall of 26 (sem 6) % (P < 0.0001) in urinary Na, an increase in K excretion (6.8 (sem 3.6) mmol/d; P = 0.07) and, compared with the HCLF group (n 49), a greater reduction in urinary Ca excretion by 0.7 (sem 0.3) mmol/d. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, intact parathyroid hormone and osteocalcin did not change, and both groups had a similar increase of 23 (sem 5) % (P < 0.0001) in C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen. The HCLF group had an 11 (sem 4) % increase (P = 0.003) in N-terminal propeptide, type I procollagen, which could indicate an increased rate of bone turnover. The fall in urinary Ca with the lower-Na lower-acid load diet is likely to have long-term beneficial effects on bone. As bone resorption was not different between the two dietary patterns with relatively high Ca intake, the effect on bone health of a dietary pattern with a lower acid load warrants further study on a lower Ca intake.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a randomized clinical trial of 105 overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcomes were weight and A1C. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure and lipids. Outcome measures were obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: The greatest reduction in weight and A1C occurred within the first 3 months. Weight loss occurred faster in the low-carbohydrate group than in the low-fat group (P = 0.005), but at 1 year a similar 3.4% weight reduction was seen in both dietary groups. There was no significant change in A1C in either group at 1 year. There was no change in blood pressure, but a greater increase in HDL was observed in the low-carbohydrate group (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 diabetes, after 1 year a low-carbohydrate diet had effects on weight and A1C similar to those seen with a low-fat diet. There was no significant effect on blood pressure, but the low-carbohydrate diet produced a greater increase in HDL cholesterol.",

Exercise training (EX) may decrease adipose tissue inflammation, thereby ameliorating such disturbances, even in the absence of fat loss. The purpose of this study was to 1) compare the effects of low-fat diet (LFD), EX, and their combination on inflammation, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet-induced obese mice and 2) determine the effect of intervention duration (i.e., 6 vs. 12 wk). C57BL/6 mice (n = 109) fed a 45% fat diet (HFD) for 6 wk were randomly assigned to an EX (treadmill: 5 days/wk, 6 or 12 wk, 40 min/day, 65-70% Vo(2max)) or sedentary (SED) group. Mice remained on HFD or were placed on a 10% fat diet (LFD) for 6 or 12 wk. Following interventions, fat pads were weighed and expressed relative to body weight; hepatic steatosis was assessed by total liver triglyceride and insulin resistance by HOMA-IR and glucose AUC. RT-PCR was used to determine adipose gene expression of MCP-1, F4/80, TNF-alpha, and leptin. By 12 wk, MCP-1, F4/80, and TNF-alpha mRNA were reduced by EX and LFD. Exercise (P = 0.02), adiposity (P = 0.03), and adipose F4/80 (P = 0.02) predicted reductions in HOMA-IR (r(2) = 0.75, P < 0.001); only adiposity (P = 0.04) predicted improvements in hepatic steatosis (r(2) = 0.51, P < 0.001). Compared with LFD, EX attenuated increases in adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and adipose MCP-1 expression from 6 to 12 wk. There are unique metabolic consequences of a sedentary lifestyle and HFD that are most evident long term, highlighting the importance of both EX and LFD in preventing obesity-related metabolic disturbances.",

Following an 8-week LED and a 2-3-week refeeding period, 131 subjects were randomized to three diets for 6 months: MUFA, moderate-fat (35-45 energy percentage (E%) fat), high in MUFA with low glycaemic index; LF, low fat (20-30 E% fat) or CTR, control (35 E% fat). A meal test study was performed in a subgroup, before and after the 6-month dietary intervention, with forty-two subjects completing both meal tests. No difference in body weight, energy intake or appetite ratings were observed between diets. Both the LF and MUFA diets compared to CTR diet reduced postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia and lowered fasting insulin from month 0 to month 6. Following the 8-week LED period lower levels of the appetite regulating peptides, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide YY, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon-like peptide-2, along with increased appetite scores were seen in comparison to measurements performed after the 6-month dietary intervention. In conclusion, the two competing diets, MUFA and LF, were equally good with respect to glucose metabolism, whereas the CTR diet resembling the typical Western diet, high in SFA, sugar and high glycaemic carbohydrates, indicated associations to lowering of insulin sensitivity. Lower levels of appetite regulatory peptides along with increased appetite scores following an 8-week LED and 2-3-week refeeding period, suggest that strategies for physiological appetite control following a LED period are needed, in order to prevent weight regain.",
