      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of supplementing diets consisting of two dent corn hybrids (soft- and hard-type) with different amounts of rapeseed oil (2, 3, and 4%) and with (0.05%) or without emulsifier (Lysoforte Extended, Kemin) on the content and deposition of carotenoids in egg yolk. The feeding trial was conducted with 216 Lohmann Brown laying hens which were by 3 located in 72 cages. The cages were randomly assigned to 12 dietary treatments (2 hybrids × 3 rapeseed oil levels × 2 emulsifier levels), resulting in 6 cages (replicates) per each dietary treatment. After depletion, hens were fed treatment diets without added pigment for 7 wk. After stabilization of the carotenoid profile (lutein, zeaxanthin, α- and β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene and total carotenoids), eggs were collected once a week until the end of the experiment and deposition efficiency was calculated based on carotenoid content in yolk and diets, yolk weight, egg production and diet intake. Corn hybrid and rapeseed oil affected (P < 0.05) the yolk content and deposition efficiency of most carotenoids. Moreover, a significant (P < 0.05) hybrid × rapeseed oil level interaction for all carotenoids indicated hybrid-specific responses to rapeseed oil supplementation. In the soft-type hybrid, the addition of 3% rapeseed oil enhanced the carotenoid content compared to 2% of rapeseed oil, whereas for the hard-type hybrid, 2 and 3% of rapeseed oil resulted in similar contents. Supplementation of 4% rapeseed oil reduced the content regardless of the hybrid. Emulsifier addition positively affected (P < 0.05) the deposition efficiency of all carotenoids except β-carotene. In conclusion, supplementing corn diets with rapeseed oil and emulsifier affected carotenoid utilization and these responses varied in hybrids differing in grain hardness, which should be considered when using corn as the sole source of carotenoids in hen diets.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a prevalent hepatic condition worldwide, is expected to develop into the leading reason for end-stage fatty liver in the forthcoming decades. Incorporating rapeseed oil into a balanced diet may be beneficial in improving NAFLD. The goal of this trial was to evaluate the impact of substituting ghee with rapeseed oil on primary outcomes such as fatty liver and liver enzymes, as well as on secondary outcomes including glycaemic variables, lipid profile and anthropometric measurements in individuals with NAFLD. Over 12 weeks, 110 patients (seventy men and forty women; BMI (mean) 28·2 (sd 1·6 kg/m2); mean age 42 (sd 9·6) years), who daily consumed ghee, were assigned to the intervention or control group through random allocation. The intervention group was advised to substitute ghee with rapeseed oil in the same amount. The control group continued the consumption of ghee and was instructed to adhere to a healthy diet. Results showed a significant reduction in the steatosis in the intervention group in comparison with the control group (P < 0·001). However, a significant change in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (–14·4 μg/l), γ-glutamyl transferase (–1·8 μg/l), TAG (–39·7 mg/dl), total cholesterol (–17·2 mg/dl), LDL (–7·5 mg/dl), fasting blood glucose (–7·5 mg/dl), insulin (–3·05 mU/l), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (–0·9), Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index (+0·01), weight (–4·3 kg), BMI (–0·04 kg/m2), waist (–5·6 cm) and waist:height ratio (–0·04) was seen in the intervention group. The consumption of rapeseed oil instead of ghee caused improvements in liver steatosis and enzymes, glycaemic variables and anthropometric measurements among individuals with NAFLD.",

In this study, the nanoemulsion consisting of clotrimazole (CLT), rapeseed oil, Pluronic F-68, Span 80, PEG 200, and lactic acid was prepared using high-speed and high-pressure homogenization. Yielded formulations were characterized by an average droplet size of 52-56 nm, homogenous size distribution by volume, and a polydispersity index (PDI) < 0.2. The osmolality of nanoemulsions (NEs) fulfilled the recommendations of the WHO advisory note. NEs were stable throughout 28 weeks of storage. The stationary and dynamic (USP apparatus IV) pilot study of the changes of free CLT over time for NEs, as well as market cream and CLT suspension as references, were conducted. Test results of the changes in the amount of free CLT released from the encapsulated form were not coherent; in the stationary method, NEs yielded up to 27% of the released CLT dose within 5 h, while in the USP apparatus IV method, NEs released up to 10% of the CLT dose. NEs are promising carriers for vaginal drug delivery in the treatment of VC; however, further development of the final dosage form and harmonized release or dissolution testing protocols are needed."

      "abstract": "Neutralization treatment improved the slow-release antioxidant food packaging function of chitosan (CS)/bamboo leaf flavone (BLF)/nano-metal oxides composite films. The film cast from the CS composite solution neutralized by KOH solution had good thermal stability. The elongation at break of the neutralized CS/BLF film was increased by about 5 times, which provided the possibility for its packaging application. After 24 h of soaking in different pH solutions, the unneutralized films swelled severely and even dissolved, while the neutralized films maintained the basic structure with a small degree of swelling, and the release trend of BLF conformed to the logistic function (R2 ≥ 0.9186). The films had a good ability to resist free radicals, which was related to the release amount of BLF and the pH of the solution. The antimicrobial neutralized CS/BLF/nano-ZnO film, like the nano-CuO and Fe3O4 films, were effective in inhibiting the increase in peroxide value and 2-thiobarbituric acid induced by thermal oxygen oxidation of rapeseed oil and had no toxicity to normal human gastric epithelial cells. Therefore, the neutralized CS/BLF/nano-ZnO film is likely to become an active food packaging material for oil-packed food, which can prolong the shelf life of packaged food.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to track changes in the volatilome of cold-pressed oil and press cakes obtained from roasted seeds and to combine it with the profile of non-volatile metabolites in a single study, in order to understand pathways of volatile organic compound (VOC) formation caused by thermal processing. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry was used for the analysis of VOCs in cold-pressed oils and corresponding press cakes obtained after roasting of seeds at 140 and 180 °C prior to pressing. Contents of primary metabolites (amino acids, saccharides, fatty acids) as well as selected secondary metabolites (glucosinolates, polyphenols) were determined, as many of them serve as precursors to volatile compounds formed especially in thermal reactions. After roasting, the formation of Maillard reaction products increased, which corresponded to the reduction of free amino acids and monosaccharides. Moreover, levels of the products of thermal oxidation of fatty acids, such as aldehydes and ketones, increased with the increasing temperature of roasting, although no significant changes were noted for fatty acids. Among sulphur-containing compounds, contents of the products and intermediates of methionine Strecker degradation increased significantly with the increasing temperature of roasting. Degradation of glucosinolates to nitriles occurred after thermal treatment. The results of this study confirmed that seed roasting before cold pressing has a significant effect on the volatiles, but also indicated roasting-induced changes in non-volatile metabolites of oil and press cake. Such an approach helps to understand metabolic changes occurring during rapeseed processing in cold-pressed oil production.",

      "abstract": "Purified desulphated glucosinolates (GSLs) were subjected to thermal treatment in model systems without interference to investigate the formation of volatile components derived from GSLs only. Desulphated progoitrin (PRO), desulphated gluconapin (GNA), and desulphated glucobrassicanapin (GBN) were isolated from rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Their structures were identified via spectroscopic data. According to the final thermal degradation compounds of the desulphated GSLs, the thermal degradation pathways of the GSLs identified herein in rapeseed during roasting were speculated. PRO degradation formed 2,4-pentadienenitrile by eliminating the hydroxyl group of the R group to generate the double bond at C-2. GNA degradation produced 4-isothiocyanato-1-butene. Two degradation pathways were possibly involved in the degradation of GNA and GBN. The main precursors that produce the pungent flavour of rapeseed oil were obtained by exploring the relationship between the degradation of the GSLs and the volatile flavour of this vegetable oil during roasting."

Nine Danish Landrace goats with 42 ± 5 days in milk were allocated to three treatment groups for 42 days. Animals received a basal diet, formulated with 85:15 forage:concentrate ratio, and the basal diet was supplemented with either rapeseed oil or sunflower oil at 4% of dry matter. Goat milk was sampled on days 14, 21, and 42. Milk composition was similar between treatments. From day 14 to day 42, milk yield increased (1.03 vs. 1.34 kg/d), while milk fat (2.72 vs. 1.82 g/d) and total solids (11.2 vs. 9.14 %) were reduced. Compared to control and rapeseed oil, sunflower decreased (P < 0.05) C4:0 (1.56, and 1.67 vs. 1.36 g/100 g) and both oils decreased (P < 0.05) C18:3n3 (0.60 vs. 0.20 and 0.10 g/100g). Rapeseed oil increased (P < 0.05) C18:2 cis9, trans11 compared to control and sunflower oil (0.37 vs. 0.13 and 0.19 g/100 g). Untargeted milk foodomics revealed slightly elevated (P < 0.05) gluconic acid and decreased hippuric acid (P < 0.05) in the milk of oil-fed goats compared to control. In vitro dry matter degradation (63.2 ± 0.02 %) was not affected by dietary treatments, while individual volatile fatty acid proportions, total volatile fatty acids (35.7 ± 2.44 mmol/l), CO2 (18.6 ± 1.15 mol), and CH4 (11.6 ± 1.16 mol) were not affected by dietary treatments. Sunflower oil and rapeseed oil decreased (P < 0.05) total gas production at 24 and 48 h compared with control. Overall, the use of sunflower oil or rapeseed oil at 4% DM inclusion did not compromise animal performance and milk composition."

Four fortified oils were made from refined rapeseed oil and one of the four additives (10% CP, 20% CP, 0.1% ES, and 0.2% ES). All fortified oils and refined rapeseed oil as a control sample were heated at 170 and 200 °C on the pan in a thin layer and evaluated regarding loss of individual tocochromanol homologs by HPLC-FL, polar compounds content, oxidized triacylglycerols (TAG), and polymers content by HPSEC-ELSD. Additionally, the fatty acid profile in nonheated oil was investigated. Tocochromanol analysis showed loss in all the samples. At 170 °C polymers were not detected; no difference was noted for polar compounds and oxidized TAG content; only the 20% CP sample showed a higher level. At 200 °C the 10% CP sample exhibited a significant protective effect with the lowest content of polar compounds, oxidized TAG, and dimers.",

This study investigated the effect of two different sources of unsaturated fatty acids, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil, as a feeding supplement on the milk foodome from dairy goats. Nine Danish Landrace goats at 42 ± 5 days in milk were allocated to three treatment groups for 42 days with three animals per group. A control group received a basal diet made of forage and concentrate at an 85:15 ratio. On top of the basal diet, the second and third groups received rapeseed oil or sunflower oil supplements at 4% of dry matter, respectively. Goat milk was sampled on days 14, 21, and 42. The milk foodome was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The milk levels of 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid, oxaloacetic acid, and taurine were higher in the milk from goats fed with sunflower oil compared to the control group. More glucose-1-phosphate was found in the milk from goats fed with rapeseed oil compared to the control group. Amino acids, valine and tyrosine, and 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid and oxaloacetic acid were higher in the sunflower group compared to the rapeseed group, while the milk from the rapeseed-fed goats had greater levels of ethanol and 2-oxoglutaric acid compared to the sunflower group. Thus, results show that foodomics is suitable for studying how milk chemistry changes as a function of feeding regime."

The recombinant BTL2 solution exhibited excellent resistance to neutral pH, high temperature, and organic solvents after a certain treatment. Finally, the effects of enzymatic transesterification for preparing biodiesel were studied, using rapeseed oil as raw material, as well as BTL2 solution as catalysts, which resulted in 86.04% yield of FAMEs under 50°C for 36 h.

      "abstract": "It is well known that rapeseed oil improves lipid profile and has antiatherosclerotic properties. Recently, amaranth oil has also become popular due to its potential health benefits. However, the effect of this oil on atherosclerosis markers in humans is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effect of amaranth and rapeseed oils on selected atherosclerosis-related parameters in overweight and obese subjects. In this randomized cross-over study, 44 subjects were instructed to consume 20 mL of amaranth oil and rapeseed oil during two consecutive three-week intervention periods separated by a washout period of the same duration as the intervention. The outcome variables included changes in tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adiponectin, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, apolipoproteins (Apo) A1, B and E as well as glucose and insulin homeostasis markers. Compared to rapeseed oil, amaranth oil had a slight positive effect on adiponectin levels (mean (95% confidence interval): 0.55 (0.22-0.89) vs. -0.29 (-0.75-0.16), p = 0.0002) but negatively affected ApoB concentrations (0.05 (-0.01-0.11) vs. 0.03 (-0.07-0.00), p = 0.0004) and ApoB/A1 ratio (0.01 (-0.03-0.05) vs. -0.02 (-0.04-0.00), p = 0.0113). No differences between the other analyzed parameters were observed. In conclusion, amaranth oil does not have a greater beneficial effect on atherosclerosis markers than rapeseed oil. However, further studies with a longer intervention period are needed. The study was retrospectively registered with the German Clinical Trials Register within the number: DRKS00014046, date of registration: 3 May 2018.",

      "abstract": "This study was performed to characterize the effect of a concentrate supplemented with free palmitic acid (4% on a DM basis; PA) or rapeseed oil (4% on a DM basis; RO) compared with a no-added-lipid control concentrate (CT) on the performance of dairy cows fed a corn silage-based diet over a 9-wk period. After a 3-wk pre-experimental period, 54 Holstein cows were randomly allocated to 3 experimental treatments to receive forage ad libitum with a fixed amount of CT, RO, or PA (8 kg/d for 2-yr-old primiparous; 10 kg/d for older cows). During the experiment, dry matter intake, milk yield and composition, fatty acid (FA) yields and FA profile, and feed efficiency were determined. At wk 9 of the experimental period, the mRNA levels of 10 genes involved in lipid metabolism in mammary tissue biopsy samples were measured. Compared with CT, RO and PA increased forage intake. Compared with CT, RO increased concentrate intake, the value being intermediate for PA. Compared with CT, RO increased milk yield (+2.0 kg/d) and decreased milk fat and protein content (-3.8 and -1.2 g/kg, respectively), whereas PA increased milk fat content (+4.1 g/kg). Compared with CT and RO treatments, PA increased milk fat yield (+179 g/d) and 3.5% fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk output (+2.8 and +2.3 kg/d, respectively), and thus improved feed efficiency (+7.3%). Compared with CT treatment, RO increased milk contents of the sum of >C16 FA, monounsaturated FA, polyunsaturated FA, trans FA, and n-3 FA, whereas PA decreased these FA contents (except n-3 FA) and also decreased n-6 FA. The variations in milk fat yield and content and FA secretion at wk 9 were not associated with modifications in mammary expression of 10 genes involved in major lipid pathways, except for the transcription factor PPARG1, which tended to be higher in PA versus RO treatment. This study demonstrated that PA improved milk fat yield and feed efficiency compared with RO and suggests that factors other than gene expression, such as substrate availability for mammary metabolism or other levels of regulation (transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational or posttranslational), could play a key role in milk fat and FA responses to changes in diet composition in cows.",

Flavor is an essential attribute, determining rapeseed oil quality and consumer acceptance. The present manuscript provides a systematic literature review of recent advances and knowledge on the flavor of rapeseed oil, which focuses on aroma-active as well as off-flavor compounds, flavor analysis techniques (i.e., extraction, qualitative, quantitative, sensory, and chemometric methods), and effects of treatments (storage, dehulling, roasting, microwave, flavoring with herbs, refining, and oil heating) on flavor from sensory and molecular perspectives. One hundred thirty-seven odorants found in rapeseed oil from literature are listed and possible formation pathways of some key aroma-active compounds are also proposed. Future flavor analysis techniques will evolve toward time-saving, portability, real-time monitoring, and visualization, which aims to obtain a \"complete\" flavor profile of rapeseed oil. The changes of volatile compounds in rapeseed oil under different treatments are summarized in this view. Studies to elucidate the influence of different treatments on the formation of aroma-active compounds are needed to get a deeper understanding of factors leading to the variations of rapeseed oil flavor.",

      "abstract": "The process of deep fat frying is the most common technological procedure applied to rapeseed oil. During heat treatment, oil loses its nutritional properties and its original consumer quality is lowered, which is often impossible to determine by organoleptic assessment. Therefore, the aim of the study was to correlate markers of the loss of the nutritional properties by rapeseed oil related to the frying time and the surface area of contact with oxygen with changes in the profile of volatile compounds. The investigations involved the process of 6-, 12-, and 18-h heating of oil with a surface-to-volume ratio (s/v ratio) of 0.378 cm-1, 0.189 cm-1, and 0.126 cm-1. Samples were analysed to determine changes in the content of polar compounds, colour, fatty acid composition, iodine value, and total chromanol content. The results were correlated with the emission of volatile compounds determined using gas chromatography and an electronic nose. The results clearly show a positive correlation between the qualitative degradation of the oil induced by prolonged heating and the response of the electronic nose to these changes. The three volumes, the maximum reaction of the metal oxide semiconductor chemoresistors, and the content of polar compounds increased along the extended frying time."

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Effective treatment for obesity associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is limited. Dietary supplementation of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically alpha linolenic acid (ALA), can resolve intrahepatic lipid content (IHL). This study investigates the effect of daily supplementation of either refined rapeseed (RA), containing high amounts of ALA, or refined olive (OL) oil on IHL and glucose metabolism in NAFLD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: 27 obese men consumed an isocaloric diet including either 50 g of RA or OL daily for 8 weeks. Hepatic proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies and blood tests are performed before and at the end of the study. At 8 weeks a significant reduction in IHL is observed for RA (13.1 ± 1.6 before versus 11.1 ± 1.6% after intervention) versus OL (13.3 ± 2.5 before versus 15.7 ± 2.7% after intervention). For RA, a 21% reduction (P < 0.02) in serum free fatty acids (FFA) and a 1.68-fold increase (P = 0.03) of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) is observed after 8 weeks. CONCLUSION: RA has a beneficial effect on hepatic lipid metabolism as shown by reduced IHL and serum FFA. RA induced IL-6 production seems to be liver protective confirming previous results.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amaranth seed oil (ASO) and rapeseed oil (RSO) are functional foods that display antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties. These oils are also known to lower glucose and cholesterol levels. The current study compared the effects exerted by RSO and ASO on weight loss and metabolic parameters during a 3-week body mass reduction program. METHODS: Eighty-one obese subjects (BMI > 30 kg/m2), aged 25-70 years, were enrolled in a 3-week body mass reduction program based on a calorie-restricted diet and physical activity. Participants were randomly categorized into an AO group (administered 20 mL/d of ASO), a RO group (administered 20 mL/d of RSO), and a C group (control; untreated). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and endpoint. RESULTS: Significant decreases in weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), fat mass (FM), lean body mass (LBM), visceral fat mass (VFM), and total body water (TBW%) were observed in all groups (P <  0.05). No significant improvements were observed in the clinical parameters of group C. Fasting insulin (Δ - 5.9, and Δ - 5.7) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (Δ - 1.1 and Δ - 0.5) were decreased in both RO and AO groups, respectively. Fasting glucose (Δ -8.5; P = 0.034), total cholesterol (Δ -14.6; P = 0.032), non-HDL cholesterol (Δ 15.9; P = 0.010), TG/HDL ratio (Δ -0.6; P = 0.032), LDL cholesterol (Δ -12.3; P = 0.042), and triglycerides (Δ -6.5; P = 0.000) were significantly improved in the AO group, compared to the RO group. CONCLUSIONS: The 3-week body mass reduction intervention caused a significant reduction in the weight, BMI, WC, HC, FM, and VFM of all groups. Except for HOMA-IR, there were no statistical differences between the clinical parameters of all groups. However, a trend toward improved insulin levels and HDL% was noticeable in AO and RO. Therapies involving edible oils with high nutritional value, such as RSO and ASO, show potential for improving metabolic measurements during body mass reduction programs. Thus, obese patients undertaking weight reduction programs may benefit from RSO and ASO supplementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: retrospectively registered, DRKS00017708.",

Soaking and grinding seeds with a NaHCO3 solution (0.1 M, pH 9.5) yielded oil bodies with a similar composition to those prepared in urea (9 M); however, the physical stability over storage was compromised due to the presence of hydrolytic enzymes.

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome represents a major risk factor for severe comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. It is also associated with an increased prevalence of emotional and cognitive alterations that in turn aggravate the disease and related outcomes. Identifying therapeutic strategies able to improve those alterations is therefore a major socioeconomical and public health challenge. We previously reported that both hippocampal inflammatory processes and neuronal plasticity contribute to the development of emotional and cognitive alterations in db/db mice, an experimental model of metabolic syndrome that displays most of the classical features of the syndrome. In that context, nutritional interventions with known impact on those neurobiological processes appear as a promising alternative to limit the development of neurobiological comorbidities of metabolic syndrome. We therefore tested here whether n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) associated with a cocktail of antioxidants can protect against the development of behavioral alterations that accompany the metabolic syndrome. Thus, this study aimed: 1) to evaluate if a diet supplemented with the plant-derived n-3 PUFA α-linolenic acid (ALA) and antioxidants (provided by n-3 PUFAs-rich rapeseed oil fortified with a mix of naturally constituting antioxidant micronutrients, including coenzyme Q10, tocopherol, and the phenolic compound canolol) improved behavioral alterations in db/db mice, and 2) to decipher the biological mechanisms underlying this behavioral effect. Although the supplemented diet did not improve anxiety-like behavior and inflammatory abnormalities, it reversed hippocampus-dependent spatial memory deficits displayed by db/db mice in a water maze task. It concomitantly changed subunit composition of glutamatergic AMPA and NMDA receptors in the hippocampus that has been shown to modulate synaptic function related to spatial memory. These data suggest that changes in local neuronal plasticity may underlie cognitive improvements in db/db mice fed the supplemented diet. The current findings might therefore provide valuable data for introducing new nutritional strategies for the treatment of behavioral complications associated with MetS.",

      "abstract": "Isoenergetic replacement of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) with cis-monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Supplementing dairy cow diets with plant oils lowers milk fat SFA concentrations. However, this feeding strategy can also increase milk fat trans fatty acids (FA) and negatively affect rumen fermentation. Protection of oil supplements from the rumen environment is therefore needed. In the present study a whey protein gel (WPG) of rapeseed oil (RO) was produced for feeding to dairy cows, in 2 experiments. In experiment 1, four multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows in mid-lactation were used in a change-over experiment, with 8-d treatment periods separated by a 5-d washout period. Total mixed ration diets containing 420 g of RO or WPG providing 420 g of RO were fed and the effects on milk production, composition, and FA concentration were measured. Experiment 2 involved 4 multiparous mid-lactation Holstein-Friesian cows in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment, with 28-d periods, to investigate the effect of incremental dietary inclusion (0, 271, 617, and 814 g/d supplemental oil) of WPG on milk production, composition, and FA concentration in the last week of each period. Whey protein gel had minimal effects on milk FA profile in experiment 1, but trans-18:1 and total trans-MUFA were higher after 8 d of supplementation with RO than with WPG. Incremental diet inclusion of WPG in experiment 2 resulted in linear increases in milk yield, cis- and trans-MUFA and PUFA, and linear decreases in SFA (from 73 to 58 g/100 g of FA) and milk fat concentration. The WPG supplement was effective at decreasing milk SFA concentration by replacement with MUFA and PUFA in experiment 2, but the increase in trans FA suggested that protection was incomplete.",

The objective of this study was to identify the protective effect of CAO in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-triggered oxidative stress and reveal the role of the p38 MAPK pathway during the protective process. CAO treatment showed an observable cytoprotective effect. Results showed that CAO significantly improved H2O2-stimulated cell death, and diminished ROS production and malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Moreover, CAO increased glutathione (GSH) content and promoted the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). As a result, apoptosis was ameliorated and depletion of the mitochondrial membrane potential was restored. Western blotting analysis demonstrated CAO downregulated the expression of caspase-3 and decreased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Notably, the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was inhibited by CAO in H2O2-induced apoptosis, which was confirmed by its inhibitor (SB203580). Taken together, our study demonstrated the pivotal role of the p38 MAPK pathway in the cytoprotective effect of CAO on oxidative stress-induced cell damage, suggesting CAO is a promising antioxidant in food and health-related fields."

      "abstract": "Contamination sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the raw material, oil production and storage processes of wood-pressed rapeseed oil were investigated in this study. The results showed that benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and PAH4 (sum of BaP, benzo[a]fluoranthene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and chrysene) were unevenly distributed in the kernel (0.56-0.98 and 2.84-8.64 μg/kg, respectively) and hull (1.53-3.17 and 13.49-22.31 μg/kg, respectively) of the rapeseed raw materials. The contents of BaP and PAH4 continuously increased during the process of wood-pressed rapeseed oil, ranging from 2.21 to 10.93 and 9.36 to 40.03 μg/kg, thus demonstrating that a wide range of pollution sources of PAHs existed for the test wood-pressed rapeseed oils. The initial temperature and time of roasting should be controlled at <210°C and <60 min, due to the generation of PAHs in rapeseed by over-roasting. In addition, contact tools and substance such as lubricating oil (from the mill), heat-transfer oil (from roasting machine), rubber gaskets and straws should be properly screened. The BaP and PAH4 of rapeseed placed in the roasting area increased from 0.5 to 2.24 and from 2.08 to 9.03 μg/kg, respectively. Therefore, roasting fume control and treatment systems are necessary and the roasting section should be strictly isolated from the other stages. Storage can slightly lower the PAHs amounts in the rapeseed oil, which made the contents of BaP and PAH4 decrease from 27.00 to 24.70 and from 138.63 to 117.58 μg/kg, respectively. Quality control measures of PAHs in wood-pressed rapeseed oil were proposed and implemented, and the final oil products' BaP and PAH4 were kept below 2 and 10 μg/kg, respectively, which meets the European Commission Regulation No. 835/2011.",

The aim of this supplementary study was to determine whether the beneficial effects resulted from altered cholesterol metabolism during the intervention.Thirty-seven men with metabolic syndrome (MetS) completed an open, randomized and balanced crossover study. Subjects' usual diet was supplemented with either 37.5 g of butter or 35 mL of CPTRO for 6-8 weeks. Otherwise normal dietary habits and physical activity were maintained without major variations. Serum non-cholesterol sterols were assayed with gas-liquid chromatography and used as surrogate markers of whole-body cholesterol synthesis and absorption efficiency. Serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) concentration was analyzed with Quantikine ELISA Immunoassay. Serum cholesterol synthesis markers and serum cholestanol (absorption marker), all as ratios to cholesterol, did not differ between the periods. Serum campesterol and sitosterol ratios to cholesterol were significantly increased after the administration of CPTRO resulting from the increased intake of 217 mg/day of plant sterols in CPTRO. Serum PCSK9 concentration did not differ between CPTRO and butter periods.The reduction in serum cholesterol by 7.2% after consumption of rapeseed oil could not be explained by changes in cholesterol absorption, synthesis or PCSK9 metabolism in MetS.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01119690.",

Control oil produced from dehulled seeds (DRO) had higher amounts of bioactive compounds, such as tocochromanols and phytosterols, lower content of pigments, and higher content of primary and secondary oxidation products compared to oil pressed from whole seeds (WRO). Oils pressed from seeds that had previously undergone thermal treatment demonstrated gradual increase of oxidative stability, radical scavenging activity, moreover microwave treatment to caused darkening of oil, assessed in terms of changes in L*a*b* coordinates as well as browning index. Thermally-induced compositional changes were seen mainly in canolol, phytosterols, and carotenoids content, while only slight increase of tocopherols and phenolics was observed. The most pronounced effect of microwave pretreatment was noted for canolol formation-for 8-min MV exposure canolol quantity was approximately 7- and 23-fold higher, in comparison with control WRO and DRO samples, respectively (increase from 61.39 to 456.04 µg/g, and from 13.39 to 320.44 µg/g)."

      "abstract": "In alternative systems for laying hens, concentrations and emission rates of particulate matter (PM) give reason for concern with regard to working conditions, bird health and productivity, and health of residents living near farms. Previously, we found that spraying a film of rapeseed oil onto the litter of broilers could substantially reduce PM concentrations and emissions. The objective of this study was to establish dose-response effects of oil spraying in aviaries on concentrations and emission rates of PM with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 μm (PM10) and 2.5 μm (PM2.5), on stockmen's exposure to PM10, on egg production, exterior quality and behavior of the hens, and on the litter. An experiment was carried out with 4 treatments: 0 (control), 15, 30, and 45 mL/m2 per d (oil treatments). Each treatment was applied in 2 rooms with different aviary systems (8 rooms in total). The experiment was repeated during a second period, both lasting 35 days. From d 11 to d 35, oil was applied daily using a spraying gun. Applying 15, 30, or 45 mL/m2 per d significantly reduced emission rates of PM10 by 27, 62, and 82%, and emission rates of PM2.5 by 71, 83, and 94%, respectively. No significant effects of oil spraying were found on mortality, egg production, dust bathing behavior, scratching behavior, plumage soiling, DM content of the litter, or friability of the litter. A significant worsening of the plumage condition was found only for the body spot back/wings/tail (not for: throat/neck, chest/breast, or legs) in the 45 mL/m2 per d treatment. Egg quality shifted significantly towards more second-class eggs in the oil treatments (1.9% versus 1.4%; P = 0.004). Remarkably, foot soiling decreased with increasing oil application. In conclusion, PM concentrations and emission rates in aviaries can be effectively reduced by spraying 15 to 30 mL/m2 per d with minor side effects within a 25 d application period.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There is convincing evidence that unsaturated fatty acids exert favourable effects on plasma cholesterol levels. However, it is not clear which type of oil has the most pronounced effect, especially not in paediatric patients. The aim was to compare two low-fat diet regimes enriched with either monounsaturated fatty acids by rapeseed oil (RO) or polyunsaturated fatty acids by sunflower oil (SO) in children affected with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-one children aged 6-18 years affected with FH were enrolled in this randomized and double-blind pilot trial. The subjects and their families were trained to adhere to a low-fat/low-cholesterol diet. All visible fats were to be replaced by either RO or SO (14-27 g/day) for 13 weeks. Dietary adherence was controlled by repeated 4-day dietary records; plasma lipids, lipoproteins and risk markers were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Out of 21 subjects, 16 could be followed-up after 6 months. RESULTS: Both fat-modified diets resulted in significant reduction in total cholesterol concentrations of 9.4% (RO P<0.005 vs SO P<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations of 12.7% (P<0.005) for RO and 11.3% (P<0.05) for SO. The reduction of the LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio (RO 9% vs SO 3.5%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (RO 16.8% vs SO 1.7%) were not statistically significant, respectively. In most participating families, a change in eating habits could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: A fat-modified diet enriched with RO seems to have very similar effects on cholesterol levels as with SO. However, our study suggests that RO has possibly more favourable effects concerning cardiovascular risk profile. Both diets appear to be feasible and were well accepted among our subjects. Although these results are promising, larger trials will be required to validate our findings.",

From epidemiological studies, the evidence for cardiovascular protection afforded by extra-virgin OO is 'convincing', and for cancers 'limited-suggestive', especially oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, but more studies are required in relation to cognitive impairment. Evidence for RO is limited to short-term studies on the biomarkers of risk factors for CVD. Any benefits of RO are likely to be due to α-linolenic acid; however, it is prone to oxidation during frying. We conclude that due to a lack of evidence from observational or intervention studies indicating that RO has comparable health benefits to extra-virgin OO, RO cannot currently be recommended as a suitable substitute for extra-virgin OO as part of a Mediterranean-style diet.",

SA was isolated from the culture broth filtrate in a crystalline form. The SA recovery from the culture filtrate has certain difficulties due to the presence of residual triglycerides of rapeseed oil. The effect of different methods of the culture filtrate treatment and various sorption materials on the coagulation of triglycerides was studied, and as a result, the precipitation of residual triglycerides by acetone was chosen. The subsequent isolation procedures involved the decomposition of H2O2 in the filtrate followed by filtrate bleaching and acidification with a mineral acid, evaporation of filtrate, and SA extraction with ethanol from the residue. The purity of crystalline SA isolated from the culture broth filtrate achieved 97.6-100 %. The product yield varied from 62.6 to 71.6 % depending on the acidity of the supernatant.",

Headspace solid phase microextraction was used to isolate the volatile compounds of rapeseed oil, which were then identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The results indicated that microwave and dehulling pretreatment of rapeseed can significantly influence the kinds and content of volatile compounds. The key flavor compounds in rapeseed oil were oxidized volatiles, heterocyclic compounds, and degradation products of glucosinolates. A pungent compound, 4-isothiocyanato-1-butene, was reduced by 97% in rapeseed treated for 3 min with microwaves energy when compared to the rapeseed oil without any treatment. The pyrazine compounds in the oil appeared after 6 min of microwave pretreatment and give a pleasant roasting flavor when compared to crude oils. Principal component analysis was able to differentiate between oils obtained using 4 pretreatment processes based on volatile compounds and electronic nose. The results showed that dehulling pretreatment could improve the flavor, yet microwaving had a greater effect on the flavor of rapeseed oils.",

The study also wished to see whether red palm oil had a cholesterol lowering effect on chicken plasma.204 male, newly hatched broiler chickens were randomly divided into twelve dietary treatment groups, and individually fed one out of six dietary fat combinations combined with either low (0.1 mg Se /kg feed) or high (1 mg Se/kg feed) dietary selenium levels. Linseed oil, independent of accompanying dietary fat source, lead to increased levels of the n-3 EPA, DPA and DHA and reduced levels of the n-6 arachidonic acid (AA). The ratio between AA/EPA was reduced from 19/1 in the soybean oil dietary groups to 1.7/1 in the linseed oil dietary groups. Dietary red palm oil reduced total chicken plasma cholesterol levels. There were no differences between the dietary groups with regard to measured meat antioxidant capacity or sensory evaluation. Chicken meat selenium levels were clearly influenced by dietary selenium levels, but were not influenced by feed fatty acid composition. High dietary selenium level lead to marginally increased n-3 EPA and higher meat fat % in breast muscle but did not influence the other LC PUFA levels. Chicken breast meat nutritional value from the soybean oil and low selenium dietary groups may be regarded as less beneficial compared to the breast meat from the linseed oil and high selenium dietary groups. Replacing rendered animal fat with palm oil and red palm oil had no negative effects on chicken muscle nutritional value with regard to fatty acid composition. Red palm oil decreased total chicken plasma cholesterol, confirming the cholesterol reducing effect of this dietary oil.",

Forty-six young healthy volunteers (age 20-29) were randomly allocated into two groups in a double-blind dietary intervention trial, involving ingestion of about 160 g chicken meat per day for 4 weeks. The ingested meat was either from chickens given a feed concentrate resembling the commercial chicken feed, containing 4% soybean oil (SO), or the meat was from chickens given a feed where the soybean oil had been replaced by 2% rapeseed oil plus 2% linseed oil (RLO).Serum total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerols, serum phospholipid fatty acid concentration, blood pressure, body weight and C-reactive protein were determined at baseline and post-intervention. In subjects consuming chicken meat from the RLO group there was a significantly (p < 0.001) increased concentration of EPA in serum phospholipids, and a reduced ratio between AA and EPA. The participants that had a low% of EPA + DHA in serum phospholipids (less than 4.6%), all increased their% of EPA + DHA after the four week intervention period when consuming the RLO chicken. No significant response differences in cholesterol, triacylglycerol, C-reactive protein, body weight or blood pressure were observed between the groups.

      "abstract": "In therapy of the metabolic syndrome, the optimal dietary approach with regard to its macronutrient composition and metabolically favourable food components, such as the plant-derived n-3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid (ALA), is still a matter of debate. We investigated the effects of a hypoenergetic diet with low energy density (ED) enriched in rapeseed oil, resulting in high MUFA content and an ALA intake of 3.5 g/d on body weight and cardiovascular risk profile in eighty-one patients with the metabolic syndrome in comparison with an olive oil diet rich in MUFA, but with a low ALA content. After a 6-month dietary intervention, body weight was significantly reduced in the rapeseed oil and olive oil groups ( -7.8 v. -6.0 kg; P < 0.05). There were significant decreases in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, and insulin levels in both groups (P < 0.05). For all of these changes, no inter-group differences were observed. After the rapeseed oil diet, diastolic blood pressure declined more than after the olive oil diet (P < 0.05 for time × group interaction). Furthermore, concentrations of serum TAG were significantly reduced after the high ALA intake, but not in the low ALA group (P < 0.05 for time × group interaction). In conclusion, our dietary food pattern with a low ED and high intakes of MUFA and ALA may be a practical approach for long-term dietary treatment in patients with the metabolic syndrome, leading to weight reduction and an improvement in the overall cardiovascular risk profile.",

      "abstract": "Rapeseeds are naturally rich in cardioprotective micronutrients but refining leads to substantial losses or the production of undesirable compounds. The Optim'Oils European project proposed innovative refining conditions to produce an optimized rapeseed oil enriched in micronutrients and low in trans linolenic acid. We aimed to investigate cardioprotective properties of this Optimized oil. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy normolipidaemic men consumed either Optimized or Standard rapeseed oils (20 g/d) and margarines (22 g/d) for 3 weeks. The Optimized oil reduced the trans FA concentration (p=0.009) and increased the contents of alpha-tocopherol (p=0.022) and coenzyme Q10 (p<0.001) in comparison with the Standard oil. Over the 3-week trial, Total-/HDL-cholesterol and LDL-/HDL-cholesterol were increased by 4% (p<0.05) with the Standard oil consumption whereas none of them rose with the Optimized rapeseed oil which increased the HDL-cholesterol and ApoA1 plasma content (+2%, NS and +3%, p<0.05 respectively). The effects observed on the plasma HDL-cholesterol levels (p=0.059), the Total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio (p=0.092), and on the ApoA1 concentrations (p=0.060) suggest an improvement of the cholesterol profile with the Optimized rapeseed oil. Finally, the Optimized oil reduced the plasma content of LDLox (-6%, NS), this effect being significantly different from the Standard oil (p=0.050). In conclusion, reasonable intake of an Optimized rapeseed oil resulting from innovative refining processes and enriched in cardioprotective micronutrients represent a relevant nutritional approach to prevent the risk of cardiovascular diseases by improving the cholesterol profile and reducing LDL oxidation.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects on lipoprotein profile, factors of coagulation and insulin sensitivity of replacing a diet rich in saturated fat from dairy foods (DF diet) with a diet including RO-based fat (RO diet). DESIGN: During a 2×3-week randomized, controlled, cross-over trial, 20 free-living hyperlipidaemic subjects were provided with isocaloric test diets that differed in fat composition alone. Blood lipoprotein profile, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors and insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic clamp) were determined before and after the dietary intervention. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study, and compliance was high according to changes in serum fatty acids. The RO diet, but not the DF diet, reduced the levels of serum cholesterol (-17%), triglycerides (-20%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-17%), cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio (-21%), apolipoprotein (apo) B/apo A-I ratio (-4%) and factor VII coagulant activity (FVIIc) (-5%) from baseline. These changes were significantly different between the diets (P=0.05 to P<0.0001), except for FVIIc (P=0.1). The RO diet, but not the DF diet, modestly increased serum lipoprotein(a) (+6%) and tended to increase the glucose disappearance rate (K-value, +33%). HDL cholesterol, insulin sensitivity, fibrinogen and tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels did not change from baseline or differ between the two diets. CONCLUSIONS: In a diet moderately high in total fat, replacing dairy fat with RO causes a rapid and clinically relevant improvement in serum lipoprotein profile including lowering of triglycerides in hyperlipidaemic individuals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Canola oil is a variety of rapeseed oil low in erucic acid (<2%). For many years, canola oil has been widely used as an ingredient in infant formula in Europe, but not in North America due to safety concerns. A number of studies have used variable canola content of infant formulas to investigate the effects of linoleic acid: α-linolenic acid ratio on visual function of infants. However, little published data is available to compare the safety of canola versus non-canola containing infant formula. The aim of this study is to investigate whether infant formulas containing canola oil support normal growth in infants as assessed by weight and length gain. METHODS: Re-analyses of data on infant weight and length gain from a prospective randomized double-blind trial in full-term infants in the German Infant Nutritional Intervention study (GINI). This analysis compared growth in infants receiving infant formulas with or without canola oil from week 4 to month 7. Absolute weight and length, weight and length gain in gram or cm per day and standardized weight and length measurements were analyzed by analyses of variance and a longitudinal random effects model. Standardization was conducted according to the new WHO 2006 age- and sex-specific child growth standards. RESULTS: Absolute and standardized weight and length measures did not differ between the formula groups with or without canola oil. This was true for both, analyses within each of the three anthropometric measurement periods (4-6 weeks, 3-4 months, 6-7 months) and for the longitudinal analyses over the whole period from 4 weeks to 7 months of life. Power analyses confirmed that sample size was sufficient to detect a difference of 3 g per day between 14 and 120 days between the two formula groups. CONCLUSIONS: Infant formula containing canola oil supports normal infant growth as assessed by weight and length gain.",

However, the effect of rapeseed oil on the markers of subclinical atherosclerosis is not known. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of dietary intake of cold-pressed turnip rapeseed oil (CPTRO) and butter on serum lipids, oxidized LDL and arterial elasticity in men with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Thirty-seven men with metabolic syndrome completed an open and balanced crossover study. Treatment periods lasted for 6 to 8 weeks and they were separated from each other with an eight-week washout period. Subjects maintained their normal dietary habits and physical activity without major variations. The daily fat adjunct consisted either of 37.5 grams of butter or 35 mL of Virgino R CPTRO. Participants were asked to spread butter on bread on the butter period and to drink CPTRO on the oil period. The fat adjunct was used as such without heating or frying. RESULTS: Compared to butter, administration of CPTRO was followed by a reduction of total cholesterol by 8% (p < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol by 11% (p < 0.001). The level of oxidized LDL was 16% lower after oil period (p = 0.024). Minimal differences in arterial elasticity were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Cold-pressed turnip rapeseed oil had favourable effects on circulating LDL cholesterol and oxidized LDL, which may be important in the management of patients at high cardiovascular risk.",

A sample of crude LEAR was transformed into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and hydrogenated using PtO(2). The hydrogenated sample was fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and the fraction containing the CFAMs transformed into picolinyl esters. Analysing these picolinyl derivatives by gas-liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that the unknown product observed in LEAR is the 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acid. This cyclic fatty acid was also found in crude LEAR and in the corresponding seeds but was not detected in crude soya and sunflower oils. As this acid is present in the same fraction as CFAMs, known to be formed during heat treatment, great care must therefore be taken for not including it when quantifying CFAMs. It is thus necessary to verify by mass spectrometry the structures of the CFAMs in the isolated cyclic fatty acid fraction prior to quantification.",

From these lines of evidence, we expected that similar results would be attained with the use of various alcohols by the supercritical treatment. However, it still remains unclear which type of reaction, transesterification or alkyl esterification, is faster. This parameter would be important in designing the optimum reaction conditions of the supercritical alcohol method. Therefore, we studied the effect of transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of fatty acids in rapeseed oil. Reaction temperature was set at 300 degrees C, and methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol or 1-octanol was used as the reactant. The results showed that transesterification of triglycerides (rapeseed oil) was slower in reaction rates than alkyl esterification of fatty acids for any of the alcohols employed. Furthermore, saturated fatty acids such as palmitic and stearic acids had slightly lower reactivity than that of the unsaturated fatty acids; oleic, linoleic and linolenic.",

Effects of trans alpha-linolenic acid on plasma lipoproteins are unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of trans alpha-linolenic acid on plasma lipids and lipoproteins in healthy European men. Eighty-eight healthy men from three European countries (France, Scotland, UK and the Netherlands) first consumed for 6 weeks a diet with experimental oils 'free' of trans fatty acids (run-in period). For the next 6 weeks, they were randomly allocated to a diet with experimental oils 'high' or 'low' in trans alpha-linolenic acid. Daily total trans alpha-linolenic acid intake in the high trans group was 1410 (range 583-2642) mg. Experimental oils were provided as such, or incorporated into margarines, cheeses, muffins and biscuits. The high trans alpha-linolenic acid diet significantly increased the plasma LDL-:HDL-cholesterol ratio by 8.1 % (95 % CI 1.4, 15.3; and the total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio by 5.1 % (95 % CI 0.4, 9.9; compared with the low-trans diet. This was largely explained by an increase in LDL-cholesterol on the high-trans diet, while no change was observed in the low-trans group (mean treatment effect of 4.7 % (95 % CI -0.8, 10.5; No effects were found on total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, apolipoprotein B and A-1, and lipoprotein(a) concentrations. In conclusion, trans alpha-linolenic acid may increase plasma LDL-:HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratios. Whether diet-induced changes in these ratios truly affects the risk for CHD remains to be established.",

      "abstract": "The influence of technological operations during rapeseed oil production on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in by-products, intermediate and final oils was evaluated. The decrease of light PAHs, benz(a)anthracene and benzo(a)pyrene during processing of crude oil to the deodorized product was significant at the 95% confidence interval in most batches analysed. Deodorization and alkali-refining were the steps contributing most to the PAH decrease. The relationship between PAH levels in rapeseed (and consequently in refined oil) and the duration of storage period was studied. The contamination of raw material processed a short time after harvesting was significantly higher than that of the rapeseed stored in silos for several months. Analyses of rapeseed samples, which were re-purified in the laboratory, revealed that solid particles, which contaminate rapeseed during harvesting, initial treatment, transport and storage, contributed to PAH contamination to the extent of 36% (light PAHs) to 64% (heavy PAHs) on average. Further experiments demonstrated that PAHs in re-purified rapeseed were concentrated in the cuticular layer, because they were removed well from the whole seeds by simple rinsing with organic solvent in an ultrasonic bath without losses of rapeseed oil. Alternative expressions of total PAH contamination (e.g. various PAH groups and/or differently defined B(a)P toxic equivalents) are discussed and their effect on drawing conclusions about PAH elimination rate has been demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in low erucic acid rapeseed oil (RO) to compensate for the effects of a restriction in fish intake on plasma fatty acid composition. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Two times 6 weeks' randomized dietary intervention was used with blind crossover design in 40 healthy unconfined women and men (age 20-46y). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were assigned to two fish restricted diets, namely RO diet and Trisun-sunflower oil (TSO) diet, with similar proportions of saturated : monounsaturated : polyunsaturated fatty acids (11.5:17.5:8.5% of total energy, En%), but differing in their ALA content (2.2 and 0.3 En%) and n-6 : n-3-ratio (3 : 1 and 23 : 1, respectively). The fatty acid compositions of plasma triglycerides (TG), cholesterol esters (CE), and phospholipids (PL) were analyzed by gas chromatography. Dietary intake was evaluated based on 3- to 7-day food records. RESULTS: The proportion of TG and CE ALA decreased on the TSO diet (from 1.6% to 0.9% and from 0.9% to 0.4%, respectively, P < 0.001) and increased on the RO diet (from 1.7% to 3.4% and from 0.9% to 1.3%, respectively, P < 0.001) compared to the baseline level. The proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in all three plasma fractions decreased on the TSO diet but not on the RO diet. The proportions of docosa-hexaenoic acid (DHA) decreased on both experimental diets and there was no difference in CE DHA between the diets. PL docosa-pentaenoic acid (DPA) and PL DHA remained at a higher level on the RO diet compared to the TSO diet (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ALA is metabolized to EPA in humans to a significant extent. The degree to which rapeseed oil (ca 50g/day) affects the proportion of EPA resembled the effect of a weekly portion (50-100g) of fatty fish depending on the fat content of the fish.",

METHODS: Twenty-two hyperlipidemic patients participated in a cross-over study comprising two consecutive 3.5-week treatment periods. The participants were free-living throughout the study period, visiting the metabolic clinic initially and at the end of each treatment period for weighing and blood sampling. All food was prepared daily and weighed out for each individual appropriate to his/her energy requirement. RESULTS: Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and the ratio between low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased to the same extent on the two diets tested, as did the apolipoproteins B, A-I and Lp(a). After adjustment for body weight changes, most of the reported effects remained virtually unaltered. However, there was a slightly greater decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with the diet containing rapeseed oil (-17%, p < 0.001) than with the olive oil diet (-13%, p < 0.01) with p < 0.04 for the difference between diets. Also, the intravenous glucose tolerance improved to a similar extent on both diets. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that lipid-lowering diets containing either rapeseed oil or olive oil have similar effects on serum lipoprotein concentration and glucose tolerance in hyperlipidemic subjects.",

In the midlactation trial, plasma glucose, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and free glycerol were not affected by oil infusion. Postprandial plasma NEFA were higher in oil-infused than in control cows; plasma triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol were significantly increased in oil treatment. Plasma insulin was lower and somatotropin higher in oil-infused cows, whereas insulin-like growth factor-I and triiodothyronine were not affected. During the early lactation trial, there were few significant effects of oil infusion on measured plasma metabolites and hormones. Preprandial glucose and NEFA were lower in oil treatment during wk 2, preprandial phospholipids were higher in wk 1 and 3, and free cholesterol was higher in wk 1. Responses of plasma glucose and NEFA to insulin challenge were not clearly affected by oil treatment during either trial. Differences in plasma triglycerides between jugular and mammary veins were higher in oil treatment in both trials. Oil infusion did not affect jugular-mammary differences of other metabolites except for a slight increase in cholesterol esters in midlactation. The relationships between jugular-mammary differences and jugular plasma concentrations showed that up to 24, 27, 54, and 17% of jugular glucose, NEFA, triglycerides, and 3-hydroxybutyrate apparently were taken up by the mammary gland.",

      "abstract": "Partially hydrogenated fish oils (PHFO) have been widely used in human food products for many years, particularly in Europe, North and South America and in South Africa. Animal studies, mainly with rapeseed oil, suggested that erucic acid might be responsible for morphological changes in the myocardium. It was suggested that other members of the docosenoic (22:1) family of fatty acids might produce similar effects to those ascribed to erucic acid. Certain PHFO can contain relatively high levels of these other isomers. Thus it was decided to evaluate PHFO of differing 22:1 levels in comparison with partially hydrogenated soybean oil (PHSBO) and refined rapeseed oil (LEAR) in a rat life span study, preceded by a breeding period in which the experimental lipids were fed to male and female parents. Two commercially produced PHFO were selected to represent the lower (PHFO-L) and upper (PHFO-U) range of 22:1 contents, 4.3 and 13.8%, respectively. A third test oil was prepared from a 50:50 blend of these (PHFO-M) to provide and intermediary 22:1 level. The control PHSBO and LEAR contained 0 and 1.0% 22:1, respectively. These experimental oils were included in semi-purified diets at 8 and 16%, respectively, in the breeding and life span periods of the study, together with 4% of oil mixtures providing essential fatty acids (EFA). Specific pathogen free (SPF). Wistar weanling rats, 200 of each sex, provided the subjects for the breeding period. Sufficient numbers of offspring were obtained in suitable condition from each treatment group to allow selection of a total of 555 weanlings for allocation to the five dietary treatments of the life span period of the study. For the life span period of the study, which was terminated after 107 to 110 weeks of treatment, 50 subjects were allocated to each of the PHSBO, PHFO-L and PHFO-U dietary groups, and 50 males to each of the LEAR and PHFO-M groups. The remaining subjects were allocated to sub-groups for sacrifice four days or 26 weeks after introduction of the life span period diets. All life span group subjects were weighed and had their food intakes recorded, and were subjected to clinical examination, routinely. At designated stages, ophthalmoscopic examination of all subjects was carried out, and samples of blood and urine were obtained from sub-groups for laboratory analysis. All decedent and terminated life span group subjects were subjected to post mortem examination, with weighing of 16 organs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

In spite of focal myocardial fibrotic lesions due to rapeseed oil, no changes were found with respect to the intrinsic myocardial contractility in vitro and and in vivo. After inotropic intervention, only the rapeseed oil fed animals showed less contractile reserve capacity. The absence of this effect in the erucic acid-treated animals is in agreement with the histological studies showing no epicardiac fibrotic lesions in these animals. It appears that erucic acid is able to interfere with the contractile system of the peripheral vascular system. Both in the rapeseed oil-treated group and the erucic acid-treated group, the vasoconstrictor response toward norepinephrine was profoundly reduced. In all three oil fed groups, isoproterenol reduced myocardial contractility which has been attributed to a lowered perfusion pressure in the coronary blood supply of the myocardium with simultaneous increased energy demand. Neither rapeseed oil nor erucic acid feeding led to electrocardiographic changes in comparison with the control sunflowerseed oil group. It is concluded that rapeseed oil and not erucic acid is responsible for loss of contractile reserve capacity without changes in the myocardial conductance system and further, that erucic acid might interfere with the peripheral vascular system. Finally, it appears that a fat rich diet might result in reduced myocardial function during a state of energy demand coupled with a blood pressure decrease.",

      "abstract": "Male Wistar rats were fed rapeseed oil containing high or low levels or erucic acid for 20 weeks, and changes in the fatty acid composition of cardiac mitochondrial phospholipids were studied. Treatment with rapeseed oil containing 46.2% erucic acid showed incorporation of 22:1 (5.6%) into isolated cardiolipin from heart mitochondria. After high or low (3.7%) erucic rapeseed oil feeding, linolenic acid was slightly incorporated into cardiolipin. Moreover, both of these rapeseed oils induced a significant increase of linoleate-arachidonate ratio in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. This ratio was also significantly increased in fatty acids esterified to the beta-position of these phospholipids. On the basis of such results, we have to consider the role of linolenic acid which is present at a high level in the different rapeseed oils used, as a possible inhibitor of heart microsomal enzymes involved in linoleate arachidonate conversion. Such alterations might account for mitochondrial fragility and myocardial lesions obtained in long term rapeseed oil feeding experiments.",

      "abstract": "The influence of long duration rapeseed oil feeding with high or low levels of erucic acid has been investigated on rat heart phospholipids. The rats treated for 20 wk with rapeseed oil containing 46.2% erucic acid showed a twofold increase in the sphingomyelin content of the heart. Treatment with primor rapeseed oil (3.7% erucic acid) for 20 wk did not modify phospholipid composition of rat heart. The fatty acid patterns of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine were slightly influenced by the high erucic rapeseed oil; eicosenoic acid was incorporated preferentially into position one, but erucic acid showed a random distribution in both. After high erucic rapeseed oil feeding, 22:1 was incorporated into cardiolipin (5.6%) and sphingomyelin (10.5%). The incorporation of 22:1 into sphingomyelin was associated with an increase of the percentage of 24:1 (14.6%) and a decrease of saturated long chain fatty acid (22:0, 24:0) percentages. Primor rapeseed oil caused a slight increase of 24:1 and a decrease of 22:0 and 24:0 in rat heart sphingomyelin. As cardiolipin is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria and sphingomyelin in plasma and microsomal membranes, the acyl-moiety alterations of both phospholipids might be correlated to the pathological lesions of rat heart after a long duration of rapeseed oil feeding.",

      "abstract": "Fully refined rapeseed oil, Brassica campestris var. Arlo plus Echo, and corn oil were fed at 20% by weight of a basal diet to young Yorkshire boars. A serial slaughter technique was employed whereby 3 boars from each dietary treatment were killed at 0,1,2,3,4 and 8 weeks of the experiment. The fatty acid profiles of heart, liver, adrenals and testes lipids were investigated. The typical fatty acids of rapeseed oil, erucic and eicosenoic acids, were incorporated at different levels into the tissue lipids examined. After feeding the rapeseed oil diet for 1 week, the relative concentration of these fatty acids increased in the adrenals, while remaining similar in the heart, liver and testes. The relative concentration of eicosenoic acid was greater than that of erucic acid in all organs examined, except for the heart which contained equal amounts of these acids. Tissue levels of these acids in boars were compared to those found in rats fed the same rapeseed oil in previous studies.",
