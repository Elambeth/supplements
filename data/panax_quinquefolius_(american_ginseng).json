      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The biological activities of osthole have been widely reported in recent years. However, few studies have been conducted on osthole in agriculture, and its effects on plant growth have little been reported. METHODS: Three experimental treatments were set up in this experiment: blank control (CK), osthole (CLS), and B. amyloliquefaciens (LKWS). In this study, the effects of osthole and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens on the growth parameters, photosynthesis, antioxidant enzyme activities, disease incidence, and microbiome of forested P. quinquefolius were tested. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that the use of osthole and B. amyloliquefaciens significantly improved the growth of Panax quinquefolius in a forest compared to that in the control treatment, increased the total chlorophyll and carotenoid content of P. quinquefolius, significantly increased its net photosynthetic rate, and decreased the stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 levels. In addition, the use of osthole and B. amyloliquefaciens significantly improved ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase (POD) activities, enhanced antioxidant activities of the P. quinquefolius POD, and reduced the disease incidence and index of American ginseng anthracnose. Based on the American ginseng microbiome analysis, the use of osthole and B. amyloliquefaciens could change the structure of the American ginseng microbial community, significantly increase the diversity of American ginseng bacteria, significantly decrease the diversity of American ginseng fungi, stimulate the recruitment of more growth-promoting microorganisms to American ginseng, and build a more stable microbial network in American ginseng. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, we found that the application of osthole had a positive effect on the growth of American ginseng, providing a theoretical basis for its subsequent application in agriculture."

      "abstract": "A prior report showed that soil previously planted with American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) contained compound(s) which could reduce ginseng resistance to root infection by Ilyonectria mors-panacis, and this was not found in extracts from ginseng roots or soils not previously planted with ginseng. However, the origin of this ginseng-related factor in ginseng soils is unknown. An isolate of Pseudomonas plecoglossicida obtained from soil where P. quinquefolius had been harvested grew more in culture media when ginseng root extract was included, indicating the use of compounds in the extract as nutrients. Treatment with cell-free extracts from media containing ginseng root extracts where P. plecoglossicida had been cultured resulted in root lesions caused by I. mors-panacis being significantly larger than roots treated with fresh media containing root extract or with cell-free media inoculated with the same bacterial isolate without root extract. Levels of ginsenosides in the media decreased over time with incubation. Genome sequencing revealed that the bacterium had genes homologous to those reported for ginsenoside metabolism, which can release sugars for microbial growth. Thus, a ginseng soil bacterium, P. plecoglossicida, can create compound(s) suppressive to root rot resistance, similar to that found in soils previously planted with ginseng, indicating that the activity suppressing root rot resistance in soil previously planted with ginseng may be of microbial origin, utilizing compounds from ginseng roots."

      "abstract": "Herbal-based medications have been used as therapeutic agents for thousands of years, particularly in Asian cultures. It is now well established that these herbal medications contain potent bioactive phytochemicals which exert a plethora of beneficial effects such as those seen on the cardiovascular system. Among the most widely studied of these herbal agents is ginseng, a member of the genus Panax, which has been shown to produce beneficial effects in terms of reducing cardiac pathology, at least in experimental studies. The beneficial effects of ginseng observed in such studies are likely attributable to their constituent ginsenosides, which are steroid-like saponins of which there are at least 100 and which vary according to ginseng species. Many ginseng species such as Panax ginseng (also known as Asian ginseng) and P quinquefolius (North American ginseng) as well as specific ginsenosides have been shown to attenuate hypertrophy as well as other indices of myocardial remodeling in a wide variety of experimental models. Ginkgo biloba on the other hand has been much less studied although the leaf extract of the ancient ginkgo tree has similarly consistently been shown to produce anti-remodeling effects. Ginkgo's primary bioactive constituents are thought to be terpene trilactones called ginkgolides, of which there are currently seven known types. Ginkgo and ginkgolides have also been shown to produce anti-remodeling effects as have been shown for ginseng in a variety of experimental models, in some cases via similar mechanisms. Although a common single mechanism for the salutary effects of these compounds is unlikely, there are a number of examples of shared effects including antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects as well as inhibition of pro-hypertrophic intracellular signaling such as that involving the calcineurin pathway which results in the upregulation of pro-hypertrophic genes. Robust clinical evidence represented by large scale phase 3 trials is lacking although there is limited supporting evidence from small trials at least with respect to ginseng. Taken together, both ginseng and ginkgo as well as their bioactive components offer potential as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of myocardial remodeling and heart failure."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lipid molecules are present in tumours and play an important role in the anti-inflammatory response as well as in antiviral protection. Changes in the type and location of lipids in the intestine following exposure to environmental stressors play an important role in several disorders, including ulcerative colitis (UC), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work is to provide a new theoretical basis for tumour initiation and development by accurately measuring the spatial distribution of lipids and metabolites in intestinal tissue. Spatial metabolomics allows the detection of samples with minimal sample volume by label-free imaging of complex samples in their original state. The distribution of lipid molecules in tumours has not been reported, although the distribution of lipid molecules in intestinal tissue has been reported in the literature. METHODS: The range of lipid profiles in colon cancer mouse tumour tissue was compiled using a spatial metabolomics: lipid extraction method. The changes in lipid distribution in two regions after oral administration of American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) vesicles were also compared. Tumour tissue samples were extracted with 80% methanol-20% formic acid in water. RESULTS: The resulting spatial metabolic profile allowed the identification of seven lipid classes in mouse tumours. The distribution of fibre tissue cells was 23.2% higher than tumour tissue cells, with the exception of the fatty acid (FA) species."

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) accumulation in American ginseng (Panax quinquefolium L.) can negatively impact its yield and safety. Our previous study found that biochar could reduce cadmium content of P. quinquefolius, however, the mechanism was yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we tested four treatments in order to reveal the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs: control, Cd, Cd + biochar and biochar. The results showed that the following responses were induced by the addition of biochar under Cd stress. Firstly, the soil physicochemical properties were improved, this is especially true for the soil pH value and soil organic matter content, which were increased by 20.42 % and 15.57 %, respectively. Secondly, the relative abundances of several beneficial microorganism phyla; such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota and Actinobacteria; were increased by 10.69 %, 20.11 % and 60.86 %, respectively. Thirdly, treatment with biochar reduced the Cd content by increasing cadmium-chelated metabolites within the soil (e.g., naringenin, caffeic acid, and valine) and increasing detoxification substances in plants (e.g., malic acid, flavonoids, and fumaric acid). Changes in these metabolites were significantly correlated with rhizosphere microecology. In summary, biochar treatment reduced the Cd content in seedlings by improving the soil properties, rhizosphere community, soil metabolites, and plant metabolites.",

      "abstract": "Panax quinquefolius shows much higher mortality to Ilyonectria mors-panacis root rot when grown in soil previously planted with ginseng than in soil not previously planted with ginseng, which is known as ginseng replant disease. Treatment of ginseng roots with methanol extracts of previous ginseng soils significantly increased root lesion sizes due to I. mors-panacis compared to roots treated with water or methanol extracts of ginseng roots or non-ginseng soils. Inoculation of water-treated roots with I. mors-panacis increased expression of a basic chitinase 1 gene (PqChi-1), neutral pathogenesis-related protein 5 gene (PqPR5) and pathogenesis-related protein 10-2 gene (PqPR10-2), which are related to jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET) or necrotrophic infection, and also increased expression of an acidic β-1-3-glucanase gene (PqGlu), which is related to salicylic acid (SA). Infection did not affect expression of a cysteine protease inhibitor gene (PqCPI). Following infection, roots treated with ginseng root extract mostly showed similar expression patterns as roots treated with water, but roots treated with previous ginseng soil extract showed reduced expression of PqChi-1, PqPR5, PqPR10-2 and PqCPI, but increased expression of PqGlu. Methanol-soluble compound(s) in soil previously planted with ginseng are able to increase root lesion size, suppress JA/ET-related gene expression and trigger SA-related gene expression in ginseng roots during I. mors-panacis infection, and may be a factor contributing to ginseng replant disease."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Panax quinquefolius L. is one of the most important foods and herbs because of its high nutritional value and medicinal potential. In our previous study we found that the ginsenoside content in P. quinquefolius was improved by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs). However, little research has been conducted on the molecular mechanisms in P. quinquefolius roots induced by AMFs colonization. To identify the metabolomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of P. quinquefolius induced by AMFs, non-mycorrhized (control) and mycorrhized (AMF) P. quinquefolius were used as experimental materials for comparative analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. RESULTS: Compared with the control, 182 metabolites and 545 genes were significantly changed at the metabolic and transcriptional levels in AMFs treatment. The metabolic pattern of AMFs was changed, and the contents of ginsenosides (Rb1, Rg2), threonine, and glutaric acid were significantly increased. There were significant differences in the expression of genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction, glutathione metabolism, and the plant-pathogen interaction pathway. In addition, several transcription factors from the NAC, WRKY, and basic helix-loop-helix families were identified in AMFs versus the control. Furthermore, the combined analysis of 'transcriptomics-metabolomics' analysis showed that 'Plant hormone signal transduction', 'Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism' and 'Glutathione metabolism' pathways were the important enriched pathways in response to AMFs colonization. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results provide new insights into P. quinquefolius response to AMFs, which improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of P. quinquefolius induced by AMFs. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is an herbal medicine with polysaccharides as its important active ingredient. The purpose of this research was to identify the effects of the polysaccharides of P. quinquefolius (WQP) on rats with antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) induced by lincomycin hydrochloride. WQP was primarily composed of galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, and arabinose. The yield, total sugar content, uronic acid content, and protein content were 6.71%, 85.2%, 31.9%, and 2.1%, respectively. WQP reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the ileum and colon, reduced the IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and TNF-α levels, increased the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in colon tissues, improved the production of acetate and propionate, regulated the gut microbiota diversity and composition, improved the relative richness of Lactobacillus and Bacteroides, and reduced the relative richness of Blautia and Coprococcus. The results indicated that WQP can enhance the recovery of the intestinal structure in rats, reduce inflammatory cytokine levels, improve short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, promote recovery of the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosal barrier, and alleviate antibiotic-related side effects such as diarrhoea and microbiota dysbiosis caused by lincomycin hydrochloride. We found that WQP can protect the intestinal barrier by increasing Occludin and Claudin-1 expression. In addition, WQP inhibited the MAPK inflammatory signaling pathway to improve the inflammatory status. This study provides a foundation for the treatment of natural polysaccharides to reduce antibiotic-related side effects.",

      "abstract": "American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is popularly consumed as traditional herbal medicine and health food for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Malonyl ginsenosides (MGR) are the main natural ginsenosides in American ginseng. However, whether the malonyl ginsenosides in P. quinquefolius (PQ-MGR) possess antidiabetic effects has not been explored yet. In this study, the antidiabetic effects and the underlying mechanism of PQ-MGR in high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced T2DM mice were investigated. The chemical composition was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Our results showed that 14 malonyl ginsenosides were identified in the PQ-MGR. Among them, the content of m-Rb1 represented about 77.4% of the total malonyl ginsenosides. After a 5-week experiment, the PQ-MGR significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels and improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-AMPK, p-ACC, PPARγ, and GLUT4 in the liver and skeletal muscle were significantly upregulated after PQ-MGR treatment. In contrast, the protein expressions of p-IRS1 and p-JNK were significantly downregulated. Our results revealed that PQ-MGR could ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in T2DM via regulation of the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphoinositide3-kinase/protein-kinase B (IRS1/PI3K/Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) pathways. These findings suggest that PQ-MGR may be used as an antidiabetic candidate drug for T2DM treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus and hypertension often occur together, amplifying cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and emphasizing the need for a multitargeted treatment approach. American ginseng (AG) and Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) species could improve glycemic control via complementary mechanisms. Additionally, a KRG-inherent component, ginsenoside Rg3, may moderate blood pressure (BP). Our objective was to investigate the therapeutic potential of coadministration of Rg3-enriched Korean Red Ginseng (Rg3-KRG) and AG, added to standard of care therapy, in the management of hypertension and cardiometabolic risk factors in type-2 diabetes. METHODS: Within a randomized controlled, parallel design of 80 participants with type-2 diabetes (HbA1c: 6.5-8%) and hypertension (systolic BP: 140-160 mmHg or treated), supplementation with either 2.25 g/day of combined Rg3-KRG + AG or wheat-bran control was assessed over a 12-wk intervention period. The primary endpoint was ambulatory 24-h systolic BP. Additional endpoints included further hemodynamic assessment, glycemic control, plasma lipids and safety monitoring. RESULTS: Combined ginseng intervention generated a mean ± SE decrease in primary endpoint of 24-h systolic BP (-3.98 ± 2.0 mmHg, p = 0.04). Additionally, there was a greater reduction in HbA1c (-0.35 ± 0.1% [-3.8 ± 1.1 mmol/mol], p = 0.02), and change in blood lipids: total cholesterol (-0.50 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.01), non-HDL-C (-0.54 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.01), triglycerides (-0.40 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.02) and LDL-C (-0.35 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.06) at 12 wks, relative to control. No adverse safety outcomes were observed. CONCLUSION: Coadministration of Rg3-KRG + AG is an effective addon for improving BP along with attaining favorable cardiometabolic outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Ginseng derivatives may offer clinical utility when included in the polypharmacy and lifestyle treatment of diabetes. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT01578837."

      "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide (CTX), used in cancer chemotherapy, a high dose of which would cause immunosuppressive effect and intestinal mucosa damage. American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) has a long history of functional food use for immunological disorder, colitis, cancer, and so on. This study aimed to illustrate the underlying mechanism of American ginseng's immunomodulatory effect in CTX-induced mice. In this study, all groups of American ginseng (American ginseng polysaccharide [AGP], American ginseng ginsenoside [AGG], co-treated with American ginseng polysaccharide and ginsenoside [AGP_AGG]) have relieve the immune disorder by reversing the lymphocyte subsets ratio in spleen and peripheral blood, as well as stimulating CD4+T cells and IgA-secreting cells in small intestine. These three treatment groups, especially AGP_AGG co-treated group recovered the intestine morphology that up-regulated villus height (VH)/crypt depth (CD) ratio, areas of mucins expression, quantity of goblet cells, and expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin). Importantly, the microbiome-metabolomics analysis was applied in this study to illustrate the possible immuno-modulating mechanism. The synergistic effect of polysaccharides and ginsenosides (AGP_AGG group) restored the gut microbiota composition and increased various beneficial mucosa-associated bacterial taxa Clostridiales, Bifidobacterium, and Lachnospiraceae, while decreased harmful bacteria Escherichia-Shigella and Peptococcaceae. Also, AGP_AGG group altered various fecal metabolites such as uric acid, xanthurenic acid, acylcarnitine, 9,10-DHOME, 13-HDoHE, LysoPE15:0, LysoPC 16:0, LysoPI 18:0, and so on, that associated with immunometabolism or protective effect of gut barrier. These results suggest AG, particularly co-treated of polysaccharide and ginsenoside may be used as immunostimulants targeting microbiome-metabolomics axis to prevent CTX-induced side effects in cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 20-30% of ginseng crops in Canada are lost to root rot each harvest. This disease is commonly caused by fungal infection with Ilyonectria, previously known as Cylindrocarpon. Previous reports have linked the virulence of fungal disease to the production of siderophores, a class of small-molecule iron chelators. However, these siderophores have not been identified in Ilyonectria. METHODS: High-resolution LC-MS/MS was used to screen Ilyonectria and Cylindrocarpon strain extracts for secondary metabolite production. These strains were also tested for their ability to cause root rot in American ginseng and categorized as virulent or avirulent. The differences in detected metabolites between the virulent and avirulent strains were compared with a focus on siderophores. RESULTS: For the first time, a siderophore N,N',N″-triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC) has been identified in Ilyonectria, and it appears to be linked to disease virulence. Siderophore production was suppressed as the concentration of iron increased, which is in agreement with previous reports. CONCLUSION: The identification of the siderophore produced by Ilyonectria gives us further insight into the root rot disease that heavily affects ginseng crop yields. This research identifies a molecular pathway previously unknown for ginseng root rot and could lead to new disease treatment options."

Angiotensin II (0.3 mg/kg) was administered to rats for 2 or 4 weeks in the presence or absence of ginseng pretreatment. The effect of ginseng (10 μg/mL) on angiotensin II (100 nM) - induced hypertrophy was also determined in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. We also determined effects of ginseng on fatty acid and glucose oxidation by measuring gene and protein expression levels of key factors. Angiotensin II treatment for 2 and 4 weeks induced cardiac hypertrophy as evidenced by increased heart weights, as well as the upregulation of the hypertrophy-related fetal gene expression levels, with all effects being abolished by ginseng. Ginseng also reduced abnormalities in left ventricular function as well as the angiotensin II-induced increased blood pressure. In myocytes, ginseng abolished the hypertrophic response to angiotensin II as assessed by surface area and gene expression of molecular markers of hypertrophy. Ginseng modulated angiotensin II-induced abnormalities in gene expression and protein levels of CD36, CPT1M, Glut4, and PDK4 in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, ginseng suppresses angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction which is related to normalization of fatty acid and glucose oxidation.",

Participants were administered 200 mg P. quinquefolius and placebo on two separate testing sessions. Six-h post-dose participants completed spatial working memory (SWM) and continuous performance (CP) tasks while SSVEP from a diffuse task-irrelevant 13 Hz flicker was recorded. RESULTS: During SWM retrieval, P. quinquefolius was associated with significantly reduced prefrontal SSVEP latency. There were no significant treatment effects on CP nor behavioural performance of either task.

During the cognitive testing, changes in hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were continuously measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).Results: Working memory task performance on the N-back task was significantly improved following active supplement consumption compared to placebo in terms of accuracy (p < .01) and response time (p < .05). Improved performance was associated with a reduction of PFC activation (p < .001) related to effortful mental demand, reflecting increased neural efficiency concomitant with improved cognitive performance. The effects were independent of background demographics variables and changes in blood glucose response and mood.Discussion: This is the first report of acute effects on cognitive performance in healthy adults following intake of a combined, multi-ingredient herbal supplement with concomitant changes in cerebral haemodynamic response. The potential synergistic effects of polyphenolic compounds on neurocognitive function and fNIRS use in nutritional intervention studies, poses a significant increase in the capacity to understand the effects of dietary compounds on the brain.",

Polysaccharides were isolated from suspension cultures of Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng), a widely used medicinal herb. A neutral fraction, AGC1, purified by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, displayed immunostimulatory activity in vitro and ex vivo. AGC1 (average molecular weight: 5.2kDa) was predominantly composed of galactose (>60%) along with the presence of several other neutral sugars such as arabinose, xylose, glucose, mannose and rhamnose in minor amounts. The major glycosidic linkages were found to be 3-Galp (48.5%), 3,6-Galp (10.2%), t-Galp (5.2%), 6-Galp (4.4%), 4-Glcp (5.7%), 4-Arap/5-Araf (4.0%) and t-Araf (4.5%). AGC1 significantly (p<0.05) stimulated the expression of a range of proinflammatory mediators in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages such as IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1 and GM-CSF. Additionally, AGC1 treatment of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated NOS2 gene expression, leading to increased levels of iNOS and downstream NO. Consistent with this, AGC1 was able to act as an immunostimulant in primary murine splenocytes, enhancing cell proliferation, as well as NO and TNF-α production. Our results also indicate the partial role of NF-κB pathway in the immunostimulatory response.",

However, nothing is known about the myocardial actions of the phenolic compounds enriched in ginseng berry. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the effects of American ginseng berry extract (GBE) in an experimental model of myocardial infarction (MI). Coronary artery ligation was performed on Sprague⁻Dawley male rats to induce MI after which animals were randomized into groups receiving either distilled water or GBE intragastrically for 8 weeks. Echocardiography and assays for malondialdehyde (MDA) and TNF-α were conducted. Flow cytometry was used to test the effects of GBE on T cell phenotypes and cytokine production. Although GBE did not improve the cardiac functional parameters, it significantly attenuated oxidative stress in post-MI rat hearts. GBE treatment also resulted in lower than control levels of TNF-α in post-MI rat hearts indicating a strong neutralizing effect of GBE on this cytokine. However, there was no effect of GBE on the proportion of different T cell subsets or ex-vivo cytokine production. Taken together, the present study demonstrates GBE reduces oxidative stress, however no effect on cardiac structure and function in post-MI rats. Moreover, reduction of TNF-α levels below baseline raises concern regarding its use as prophylactic or preventive adjunct therapy in cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prediabetes describes a state of hyperglycemia outside of normal limits that does not meet the criteria for diabetes diagnosis, is generally symptomless, and affects an estimated 38% of adults in the United States. Prediabetes typically precedes the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, which accounts for increased morbidity and mortality. Although the use of dietary and herbal supplements is popular worldwide, and a variety of single herbal medicines have been examined for glycemic management, the potential of increasingly common polyherbal formulations to return glycemic parameters to normal ranges among adults with prediabetes remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a commercially available, polyherbal dietary supplement on glycemic and lipid parameters in prediabetic individuals. METHODS: In this multi-site, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial, 40 participants with prediabetes will be randomized to either a daily oral polyherbal dietary supplement (GlucoSupreme™ Herbal; Designs for Health®, Suffield, CT, USA; containing cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum cassia), banaba leaf (Lagerstroemia speciosa standardized to 1% corosolic acid), kudzu root (Pueraria lobata standardized to 40% isoflavones), fenugreek seed (Trigonella foenum-graceum standardized to 60% saponins), gymnema leaf (Gymnema sylvestre standardized to 25% gymnemic acid), American ginseng root (Panax quinquefolius standardized to 5% ginsenosides), and berberine HCl derived from bark (Berberis aristata)) or placebo for 12 weeks. Short-, medium-, and comparatively long-term markers of glycemic control (blood glucose and fasting insulin, fructosamine, and glycated hemoglobin/A1c, respectively), and other glycemic parameters (GlycoMark, β-cell function, and insulin sensitivity/resistance) will be obtained. Lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides), inflammation (hs-CRP), progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as safety indices (ALT, AST) will be obtained. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess changes in study outcomes. DISCUSSION: Treatment options for adults with prediabetes are currently limited. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a commercially available dietary supplement in the popular, but as yet insufficiently studied, category of polyherbal formulas for the management of glycemic parameters and other biomarkers associated with prediabetes.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Similar to the leaves of P. Quinquefolius, American ginseng berry (AGB) is another important part of P. Quinquefolius with alternative therapeutic potential. The liver protection capabilities of the former have been demonstrated previously, however, the later has not yet been evaluated. PURPOSE: Based on our previous observation, the present work was designed to evaluate the hepatic protective effects for novel mechanisms of AGB in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury in vivo. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: All mice were divided into four groups as follows: normal group, APAP group and APAP + AGB (150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg) groups. AGB were orally administered for one week before exposure to APAP (250 mg/kg). Severe liver injury was observed and hepatotoxicity was evaluated after 24 h through evaluating the biochemical markers, protein expressions levels and liver histopathology. RESULTS: Our study results clearly demonstrated that AGB pretreatment ameliorated APAP-induced hepatic injury as evidenced by decreasing plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) compared to the APAP group. Western blotting analysis showed that pretreatment with AGB decreased the expressions levels of TNF-α and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB p65) in liver tissues. Meanwhile, the protein expression levels of caspases, cytochrome c, and Bax were elevated by AGB treatment for seven days, while the protein expression level of Bcl-2 was inhibited comparison with that in APAP group. Furthermore, supplement of AGB resulted in increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), while decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the expression levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and cytochrome P450 E1 (CYP2E1). The results of histopathological staining demonstrated that AGB pretreatment inhibited APAP-induced hepatocyte infiltration, congestion, and necrosis. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that AGB pretreatment protected liver cells against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation responses via TNF-α-mediated caspase-3/-8/-9 signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a significant public health problem in the United States. Abdominal pain is a major complaint among individuals with IBD. Successful IBD management not only controls enteric inflammation, but also reduces abdominal discomfort. Recently, increased attention has been focused on alternative strategies for IBD management. HPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis was employed to evaluate the intestinal microbiome's biotransformation of parent American ginseng compounds into their metabolites. Using a DSS mouse model, the effects of American ginseng microbial metabolites on chemically induced colitis was investigated with disease activity index and histological assessment. Expressions of inflammatory cytokines were determined using real-time PCR and ELISA. Abdominal pain was evaluated using the von Frey filament test. After the gut microbiome's biotransformation, the major metabolites were found to be the compound K and ginsenoside Rg3. Compared with the DSS animal group, American ginseng treatment significantly attenuated experimental colitis, as supported by the histological assessment. The enteric microbiome-derived metabolites of ginseng significantly attenuated the abdominal pain. American ginseng treatment significantly reduced gut inflammation, consistent with pro-inflammatory cytokine level changes. The gut microbial metabolite compound K showed significant anti-inflammatory effects even at low concentrations, compared to its parent ginsenoside Rb1. American ginseng intestinal microbial metabolites significantly reduced chemically-induced colitis and abdominal pain, as mediated by the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Intestinal microbial metabolism plays a critical role in American ginseng mediated colitis management.",

Many patients with fatigue report the use of herbal remedies. Ginseng is one of the most widely used because it is believed to improve energy, physical and emotional health, and well-being. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the published evidence to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the two types of Panax ginseng (Asian [Panax ginseng] and American [Panax quinquefolius]) as treatments for fatigue. DESIGN: PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health), Ovid MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were searched using Medical Subject Heading and keyword terms, including ginseng, Panax, ginsenosides, ginsenoside* (wild card), fatigue, fatigue syndrome, cancer-related fatigue, and chronic fatigue. Studies were included if participants had fatigue, had used one of the two Panax ginsengs as an intervention, and had scores from a self-report fatigue measure. Two reviewers independently assessed each article at each review phase and met to develop consensus on included studies. Risk of bias was assessed using version 5.3 of the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (RevMan), and results were synthesized in a narrative summary. RESULTS: The search strategy resulted in 149 articles, with 1 additional article located through review of references. After titles, abstracts, and full text were reviewed, 139 articles did not meet inclusion criteria. For the 10 studies reviewed, there was a low risk of adverse events associated with the use of ginseng and modest evidence for its efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Ginseng is a promising treatment for fatigue. Both American and Asian ginseng may be viable treatments for fatigue in people with chronic illness. Because of ginseng's widespread use, a critical need exists for continued research that is methodologically stronger and that includes more diverse samples before ginseng is adopted as a standard treatment option for fatigue.",

Panax quinquefolius saponin (PQS) is the major active ingredient of American ginseng and has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic roles in various diseases. However, the potential effect of PQS on the pathological process of acute SCI remains unknown. This work tested the effects of PQS on acute SCI and clarified its potential mechanisms. PQS treatment ameliorated the damage to spinal tissue and improved the functional recovery after SCI. PQS treatment inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the associated apoptosis after acute SCI. PQS further abolished the triglyceride (TG)-induced ER stress and associated apoptosis in neuronal cultures. PQS appears to inhibit the ER-stress-induced neurite injury in PC12 cells. Our results suggest that PQS is a novel therapeutic agent for acute central nervous system injury.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite the lack of evidence, a growing number of people are using herbal medicine to attenuate the burden of diabetes. There is an urgent need to investigate the clinical potential of herbs. Preliminary observations suggest that American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius [AG]) may reduce postprandial glycemia. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AG as an add-on therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) controlled by conventional treatment. METHODS: 24 individuals living with T2DM completed the study (F:M = 11:13; age = 64 ± 7 year; BMI = 27.8 ± 4.6 kg/m2; HbA1c = 7.1 ± 1.2%). Utilizing a double-blind, cross-over design, the participants were randomized to receive either 1 g/meal (3 g/day) of AG extract or placebo for 8 weeks while maintaining their original treatment. Following a ≥ 4-week washout period, the participants were crossed over to the opposite 8-week treatment arm. The primary objective was HbA1c, and secondary endpoints included fasting blood glucose and insulin, blood pressure, plasma lipids, serum nitrates/nitrites (NOx), and plasominogen-activating factor-1 (PAI-1). Safety parameters included liver and kidney function. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, AG significantly reduced HbA1c (- 0.29%; p = 0.041) and fasting blood glucose (- 0.71 mmol/L; p = 0.008). Furthermore, AG lowered systolic blood pressure (- 5.6 ± 2.7 mmHg; p < 0.001), increased NOx (+ 1.85 ± 2.13 µmol/L; p < 0.03), and produced a mean percent end-difference of - 12.3 ± 3.9% in LDL-C and - 13.9 ± 5.8% in LDL-C/HDL. The safety profiles were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: AG extract added to conventional treatment provided an effective and safe adjunct in the management of T2DM. Larger studies using physiologically standardized ginseng preparations are warranted to substantiate the present findings and to demonstrate therapeutic effectiveness of AG. CLINICALTRIALS.

This study was aimed at investigating the hepatoprotective effect of GE against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury in rats. METHODS: We treated Wistar rats daily with low, medium, and high [0.625 g/kg body weight (bw), 1.25 g/kg bw, and 3.125 g/kg bw, respectively] doses of GE for 9 wk. After the 1st wk of treatment, rats were administered 20% CCl4 (1.5 mL/kg bw) two times a week to induce liver damage until the treatment ended. RESULTS: Serum biochemical analysis indicated that GE ameliorated the elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase and albumin decline in CCl4-treated rats. Moreover, CCl4-induced accumulation of hepatic total cholesterol and triglyceride was inhibited. The hepatoprotective effects of GE involved enhancing the hepatic antioxidant defense system including glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. In addition, histological analysis using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining showed that GE inhibited CCl4-induced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of alpha-smooth muscle actin indicated that CCl4-triggered activation of hepatic stellate cells was reduced. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that GE improves CCl4-induced liver inflammation and fibrosis by attenuating oxidative stress. Therefore, GE could be a promising hepatoprotective herbal formulation for future development of phytotherapy."

Konjac-glucomannan-based fibre blend (KGB) and American ginseng (AG) have individually been shown to improve glycaemia and CVD risk factors in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether co-administration of KGB and AG could improve diabetes control beyond conventional treatment. METHOD: Thirty-nine participants with type 2 diabetes (6.5 > A1c < 8.4%) were enrolled between January 2002 and May 2003 at the Risk Factor Modification Centre at St Michaels Hospital in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with each intervention lasting 12-weeks. Medications, diet and lifestyle were kept constant. Interventions consisted of 6 g of fibre from KGB together with 3 g of AG (KGB and AG) or wheat bran-based, fibre-matched control. Primary endpoint was the difference in HbA1c levels at week 12. RESULTS: Thirty participants (18M:12F; age: 64 ± 7 years; BMI: 28 ± 5 kg/m2; HbA1c: 7.0 ± 1.0%) completed the study, and consumed 5.5 and 4.9 g/day of fibre from KGB and wheat bran control, respectively, and 2.7 g/day of AG. At week 12, HbA1c levels were 0.31% lower on the KGB and AG compared to control (p = 0.011). Mean (±SEM) plasma lipids decreased on the KGB and AG vs control by 8.3 ± 3.1% in LDL-C (p = 0.002), 7.5 ± 2.4% in non-HDL-C (p = 0.013), 5.7 ± 1.9% in total-C (p = 0.012), 4.1 ± 2.1% in total-C:HDL-C ratio (p = 0.042), 9.0 ± 2.3% in ApoB (p = 0.0005) and 14.6 ± 4.2% in ApoB:ApoA1 ratio (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of KGB and AG increases the effectiveness of conventional therapy through a moderate but clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c and lipid concentrations over 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) show different properties and medicinal applications in pharmacology, even though the main active constituents of them are both thought to be ginsenosides. Metabolomics is a promising method to profile entire endogenous metabolites and monitor their fluctuations related to exogenous stimulus. Herein, an untargeted metabolomics approach was applied to study the overall urine metabolic differences between Asian ginseng and American ginseng in mice. Metabolomics analyses were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. A total of 21 metabolites related to D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, TCA cycle and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, differed significantly under the Asian ginseng treatment; 34 metabolites mainly associated with glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, TCA cycle and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, were significantly altered after American ginseng treatment. Urinary metabolomics reveal that Asian ginseng and American ginseng can benefit organism physiological and biological functions via regulating multiple metabolic pathways. The important pathways identified from Asian ginseng and American ginseng can also help to explore new therapeutic effects or action targets so as to broad application of these two ginsengs.",

The major focus is on the antiobesity effects and the physiological, cellular and molecular mechanisms of ginseng and its ginsenosides in cultured cells, animal models and humans. We particularly compared the ginsenosides profiles, the antiobesity effects and the mechanisms between Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), the two major ginseng species having opposite medical effects in traditional Chinese medicine.

Here, we determined whether North American ginseng can modulate the deleterious effects of the β-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol on cardiac hypertrophy and function using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Isoproterenol was administered for 2 weeks at either 25 mg/kg per day or 50 mg/kg per day (ISO25 or ISO50) via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini-pump to either control rats or those receiving ginseng (0.9 g/L in the drinking water ad libitum). Isoproterenol produced time- and dose-dependent left ventricular dysfunction, although these effects were attenuated by ginseng. Improved cardiac functions were associated with reduced heart masses, as well as prevention in the upregulation of the hypertrophy-related fetal gene expression. Lung masses were similarly attenuated, suggesting reduced pulmonary congestion. In in vitro studies, ginseng (10 μg/mL) completely suppressed the hypertrophic response to 1 μmol/L isoproterenol in terms of myocyte surface area, as well as reduction in the upregulation of fetal gene expression. These effects were associated with attenuation in both protein kinase A and cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation. Ginseng attenuates adverse cardiac adrenergic responses and, therefore, may be an effective therapy to reduce hypertrophy and heart failure associated with excessive catecholamine production.",

North American (NA) ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is a popular natural health product with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of NA ginseng on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and cardiac function in endotoxemia, a model of sepsis. Mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce endotoxemia. Myocardial expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that causes cardiac dysfunction, was upregulated in mice with endotoxemia, which was accompanied by increases in NOX2 expression, superoxide generation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Notably, pretreatment with NA ginseng aqueous extract (50mg/kg/day, oral gavage) for 5days significantly inhibited NOX2 expression, superoxide generation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and TNF-α expression in the heart during endotoxemia. Importantly, cardiac function and survival in endotoxemic mice were significantly improved. Additionally, pretreatment with ginseng extract inhibited superoxide generation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and TNF-α expression induced by LPS in cultured cardiomyocytes. We conclude that NA ginseng inhibits myocardial NOX2-ERK1/2-TNF-α signaling pathway and improves cardiac function in endotoxemia, suggesting that NA ginseng may have the potential in the prevention of clinical sepsis.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male laca mice were sleep deprived for 72-h by using Grid suspended over water method. Panax quinquefolius (American Ginseng 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) was administered alone and in combination with GABA modulators (GABA Cl(-) channel inhibitor, GABA-benzodiazepine receptor inhibitor and GABAA agonist) for 8 days, starting 5 days prior to 72-h sleep deprivation period. Various behavioral (locomotor activity, mirror chamber test), biochemical (lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, catalase, nitrite levels), mitochondrial complexes, neuroinflammation marker (Tumor Necrosis Factor, TNF-alpha), serum corticosterone, and histopathological sections of brains were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy two hours sleep deprivation significantly impaired locomotor activity, caused anxiety-like behavior, conditions of oxidative stress, alterations in mitochondrial enzyme complex activities, raised serum corticosterone levels, brain TNFα levels and led to neuroinflammation like signs in discrete brain areas as compared to naive group. Panax quinquefolius (100 and 200 mg/kg) treatment restored the behavioral, biochemical, mitochondrial, molecular and histopathological alterations. Pre-treatment of GABA Cl(-) channel inhibitor as well as GABA-benzodiazepine receptor inhibitor, significantly reversed the protective effect of P. quinquefolius (100 mg/kg) in 72-h sleep deprived animals (P < 0.05). However, pretreatment with GABAA agonist, potentiated Panax quinquefolius's protective effect which was significant as compared to their effect per se (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: GABA-ergic mechanism could be involved in the neuroprotective effect of P.quinquefolius against sleep deprivation induced anxiety-like behavior, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, HPA axis activation and neuroinflammation."

      "abstract": "Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. Angiogenesis inhibitors have been introduced for the treatment of cancer. Based on the fact that many anticancer agents have been developed from botanical sources, there is a significant untapped resource to be found in natural products. American ginseng is a commonly used herbal medicine in the U.S., which possess antioxidant properties. After oral ingestion, natural ginseng saponins are biotransformed to their metabolites by the enteric microbiome before being absorbed. The major metabolites, ginsenoside Rg3 and compound K, showed significant potent anticancer activity compared to that of their parent ginsenosides Rb1, Rc and Rd. In this review, the molecular mechanisms of ginseng metabolites on cancer chemoprevention, especially apoptosis and angiogenic inhibition, are discussed. Ginseng gut microbiome metabolites showed significant anti-angiogenic effects on pulmonary, gastric and ovarian cancers. This review suggests that in addition to the chemopreventive effects of ginseng compounds, as angiogenic inhibitors, ginsenoside metabolites could be used in combination with other cancer chemotherapeutic agents in cancer management."

      "abstract": "The ginseng family, including Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng), Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng), and Panax notoginseng (notoginseng), is commonly used herbal medicine. White ginseng is prepared by air-drying after harvest, while red ginseng is prepared by a steaming or heating process. The anticancer activity of red ginseng is significantly increased, due to the production of active anticancer ginsenosides during the steaming treatment, compared with that of white ginseng. Thus far, anticancer studies have been mostly focused on Asian ginseng. In this article, we review the research progress made in the anticancer activities of red Asian ginseng, red American ginseng and red notoginseng. The major anticancer mechanisms of red ginseng compounds include cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis/paraptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. The structure-function relationship analysis has revealed that the protopanaxadiol group ginsenosides have more potent effects than the protopanaxatriol group. Sugar molecules in ginsenosides inversely impact the antiproliferative potential of these compounds. In addition, ginsenoside stereoselectivity and double bond position also influence the anticancer activity. Future studies should focus on characterizing active red ginseng derivatives as potential anticancer drugs.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Although dependence to methamphetamine (METH) is associated with serious psychiatric symptoms and is a global health and social problem, no effective therapeutic approaches have been identified. Pseudoginsenoside-F11 (PF11) is an ocotillol-type saponin that is isolated from Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) and was shown to have neuroprotective effects to promote learning and memory and to antagonize the pharmacological effects of morphine. Furthermore, PF11 also shows protective effects against METH-induced neurotoxicity in mice. However, the effects of PF11 on METH-induced preference and dopamine (DA) release have not been defined. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of PF11 administration on METH-induced hyperlocomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. Subsequently, extracellular DA and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were determined in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice after co-administration of PF11 and METH using in vivo microdialysis analyses. Moreover, the effects of PF11 administration on the μ-opioid neuronal responses, DAMGO (μ-opioid receptor agonist; [D-Ala(2), N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin)-induced hyperlocomotion and accumbal extracellular DA increase were investigated to elucidate how PF11 inhibits METH-induced dependence by dopaminergic neuronal hyperfunction. RESULTS: Co-administration of PF11 and METH for 6 days attenuated METH-induced locomotor sensitization compared with treatment with METH alone. In the CPP test, PF11 administration also inhibited METH-induced place preference. In vivo microdialysis analyses indicated that co-administration of PF11 and METH for 7 days prevented METH-induced extracellular DA increase in the NAc and repeated PF11 administration with or without METH for 7 days increased extracellular GABA levels in the NAc, whereas single administration of PF11 did not. Furthermore, DAMGO-induced hyperlocomotion and accumbal extracellular DA increase were significantly inhibited by acute PF11 administration. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that PF11 inhibits METH-induced hyperlocomotion, preference, and accumbal extracellular DA increase by regulating GABAergic neurons and μ-opioid receptors.",

      "abstract": "American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is one of the most commonly used herbal medicines in the West. It has been reported to possess significant antitumor effects that inhibit the process of carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying its anticancer effects remain largely unresolved. In this study, we investigated the cancer chemopreventive effects of American ginseng on the progression of high fat (HF) diet-enhanced colorectal carcinogenesis with a genetically engineered Apc(Min/+) mouse model. The metabolic alterations in sera of experimental mice perturbed by HF diet intervention as well as the American ginseng treatment were measured by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) analysis. American ginseng treatment significantly extended the life span of the Apc(Min/+) mouse. Significant alterations of metabolites involving amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, and carbohydrates were observed in Apc(Min/+) mouse in sera, which were attenuated by American ginseng treatment and concurrent with the histopathological improvement with significantly reduced tumor initiation, progression and gut inflammation. These metabolic changes suggest that the preventive effect of American ginseng is associated with attenuation of impaired amino acid, carbohydrates, and lipid metabolism. It also appears that American ginseng induced significant metabolic alterations independent of the Apc(Min/+) induced metabolic changes. The significantly altered metabolites induced by American ginseng intervention include arachidonic acid, linolelaidic acid, glutamate, docosahexaenoate, tryptophan, and fructose, all of which are associated with inflammation and oxidation. This suggests that American ginseng exerts the chemopreventive effects by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms.",

The present study represented a partial replication investigating whether these effects extended to healthy middle-aged individuals. METHODS: Fifty-two healthy volunteers (40-60 years old, mean age 51.63) received 200 mg of P. quinquefolius or a matching placebo according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced, crossover design. The Cognitive Drug Research battery and the Computerised Mental Performance Assessment System were used to evaluate cognitive performance at baseline then 1, 3 and 6 h following treatment. Blood glucose and mood were co-monitored. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, P. quinquefolius improved cognitive performance on 'Working Memory' factor at 3 h. Similar effects were observed in one of the two tasks making up this factor, spatial working memory. There were no significant effects on mood or blood glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that P. quinquefolius can acutely benefit working memory and extend the age range of this effect to middle-aged individuals. These changes are unlikely to be underpinned by modulation of blood glucose in this population.",

North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties and thus may offset some of this exercise-induced damage. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that intervention with North American ginseng would reduce eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammation. Male Wistar rats were fed (300 mg/(kg·day)(-1)) of either an alcohol (AL) or aqueous (AQ) extract of North American ginseng for 14 days before a single bout of downhill running and were compared with matching nonexercised (C) groups. Plasma creatine kinase levels were significantly reduced in both ginseng treated groups compared with the C group that received a water placebo (p < 0.002). Further, the AQ but not AL group also showed attenuated morphological signs of damage (hemotoxylin and eosin) as well as reduced levels of infiltrating neutrophils (HIS48) in the soleus muscle (p < 0.001). In summary, supplementation with an AQ but not AL extract of North American ginseng was able to reduce eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammation.",

Recently, the studies about American ginseng polysaccharides are mainly centered on acidic polysaccharides, while there is relatively limited research that explores neutral polysaccharides. In this study a novel neutral polysaccharide (PPQN) was isolated from American ginseng roots and its structure and anti-inflammatory activity were investigated. The average molecular weight (Mw) of PPQN was 3.1 kDa. Monosaccharide components' analysis indicated that PPQN was composed of glucose (Glc) and galactose (Gal) in a molar ratio of 1:1.15. Secretions of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation were detected in PPQN pre-treatment RAW264.7 macrophages. PPQN (150 μg/mL) exhibited more effective inhibition of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 secretions, followed by NO production with respective values of 40.5%, 41.1%, 34.4%, and 11.1% suppression. These results indicated that PPQN may have therapeutic implications in treatment of inflammation and inflammatory-related diseases.",

The objective of the present study was to test the safety of supplementation with the American ginseng (AG) interventional material as an adjunct to conventional therapy (diet and/or medications) in type 2 diabetes, using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Methods. Each participant received either AG (10% ginsenosides) or placebo capsules (500 mg/meal = 3 g/day) for a period of 12 weeks. Outcomes included measures of safety including kidney function (urates and creatinine), liver function (AST and ALT), and haemostatic function (PV and INR). Results. Seventy-four participants with well-controlled type 2 diabetes (sex: 28 M and 46 F, age: 63 ± 9.5, BMI: 32 ± 5, and HbA1c: 7 ± 1.3), randomized to either intervention (n = 35) or control (n = 39) group, completed the study. There was no change in any of the measures of safety between treatments from baseline. The number or severity of adverse events did not differ between the AG intervention and placebo. Conclusion. Following 12 weeks of supplementation with AG, safety was not compromised in a high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk population of patients with type 2 diabetes. This demonstrated that safety is noteworthy, as reviews have continuously warned of possible adverse effects of ginseng consumption."

There are anecdotal reports that American ginseng helps reduce body temperature, whereas Korean ginseng improves blood circulation and increases body temperature; however, their respective effects on body temperature and metabolic parameters have not been studied. We investigated body temperature and metabolic parameters in mice using a metabolic cage. After administering ginseng extracts acutely (single dose of 1000 mg/kg) or chronically (200 mg/kg/day for four weeks), core body temperature, food intake, oxygen consumption and activity were measured, as well as serum levels of pyrogen-related factors and mRNA expression of metabolic genes. Acute treatment with American ginseng reduced body temperature compared with PBS-treated mice during the night; however, there was no significant effect of ginseng treatment on body temperature after four weeks of treatment. VO 2, VCO 2, food intake, activity and energy expenditure were unchanged after both acute and chronic ginseng treatment compared with PBS treatment. In acutely treated mice, serum thyroxin levels were reduced by red and American ginseng, and the serum prostaglandin E2 level was reduced by American ginseng. In chronically treated mice, red and white ginseng reduced thyroxin levels. We conclude that Korean ginseng does not stimulate metabolism in mice, whereas a high dose of American ginseng may reduce night-time body temperature and pyrogen-related factors.",

Some of its claimed benefits can be attributed to the immunomodulatory activities, whose molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Methods. Murine splenic cells from adult male C57BL/6 (B6) mice were isolated and divided into 4 groups to mimic 4 basic pathophysiological states: (1) normal naïve; (2) normal activated; (3) deficient naïve; (4) deficient activated. Then, different AG extracts were added to all groups for 24 h incubation. MTT proliferation assays were performed to evaluate the phenotypic features of cells. Finally, microarray assays were carried out to identify differentially expressed genes associated with AG exposure. Real-time PCR was performed to validate the expression of selected genes. Results. Microarray data showed that most of gene expression changes were identified in the deficient naïve group, suggesting that the pathophysiological state has major impacts on transcriptomic changes associated with AG exposure. Specifically, this study revealed downregulation of interferon- γ signaling pathway in the deficient group of cells. Conclusion. Our study demonstrated that only specific groups of immune cells responded to AG intervention and immunocompromised cells were more likely regulated by AG treatment."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Substantial pre-clinical and some clinical data are available showing that Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) varieties or its particular ginsenosides exert a vasodilatating effect, thus may modulate vascular function. However, the clinical evidence for American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is scarce. Therefore, this study evaluates the effect of American ginseng (AG) on arterial stiffness, as measured by augmentation index (AI), and blood pressure (BP), in type 2 diabetes patients with concomitant hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, each participant was randomized to either the selected AG extract or placebo at daily dose of 3g for 12 weeks as an adjunct to their usual antihypertensive and anti-diabetic therapy (diet and/or medications). AI and BP were measured by applanation tonometry at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 64 individuals with well-controlled essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes (gender: 22 M:42 F, age:63 ± 9.3 years, BP: 145 ± 10.8/84 ± 8.0 mmHg, HbA1c: 7.0 ± 1.3%, fasting blood glucose (FBG): 8.1 ± 2.3 mmol/L) completed the study. Compared to placebo, 3g of AG significantly lowered radial AI by 5.3% (P=0.041) and systolic BP by 11.7% (P<0.001) at 12 weeks. No effect was observed with diastolic BP. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of AG extract to conventional therapy in diabetes with concomitant hypertension improved arterial stiffness and attenuated systolic BP, thus warrants further investigation on long-term endothelial parameters before recommended as an adjunct treatment.",

      "abstract": "Panax quinquefolius saponin of stem and leaf (PQS), the effective parts of American ginseng, is widely used in China as a folk medicine for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases treatment. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that PQS could improve the endothelial function of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats with high glucose fluctuation. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of PQS against intermittent high glucose-induced oxidative damage on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase kinase (PI3K)/Akt/GSK-3 β pathway involved. Our results suggested that exposure of HUVECs to a high glucose concentration for 8 days showed a great decrease in cell viability accompanied by marked MDA content increase and SOD activity decrease. Moreover, high glucose significantly reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 β . More importantly, these effects were even more evident in intermittent high glucose condition. PQS treatment significantly attenuated intermittent high glucose-induced oxidative damage on HUVECs and meanwhile increased cell viability and phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 β of HUVECs. Interestingly, all these reverse effects of PQS on intermittent high glucose-cultured HUVECs were inhibited by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These findings suggest that PQS attenuates intermittent-high-glucose-induced oxidative stress injury in HUVECs by PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 β pathway."

Extract of the NAG root has been reported to possess antidiabetic properties, but the underlying mechanisms for such effects have not been identified. Here we investigated the effects of NAG root extract on type 1 and 2 diabetes and the underlying mechanisms involved for such effects. Type 1 [C57BL/6 mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induction] and type 2 (db/db) diabetic models were examined. Groups of diabetic mice (both type 1 and 2) were treated with alcoholic extract of the NAG root (200 mg/kg BW/day, oral gavage) for 1 or 2 months following onset of diabetes. Ginseng treatment significantly increased the body weight in type 1 diabetic animals in contrast to the type 2 model, where it caused diminution of body weight. Blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels diminished in the diabetic groups of both models with NAG treatment. Interestingly, plasma insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly increased in the STZ-diabetic mice, whereas they were reduced in the db/db mice following NAG treatment. Histological and morphometric analyses (islet/pancreas ratio) of the pancreas revealed an increase in the islet area following the treatment compared to both the untreated diabetic groups. These data indicate that NAG possibly causes regeneration of β-cells resulting in enhanced insulin secretion. On the other hand, in type 2 diabetes, the additional effects of NAG on body weight might have also resulted in improved glucose control.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Safe, effective interventions to improve cancer-related fatigue (CRF) are needed because it remains a prevalent, distressing, and activity-limiting symptom. Based on pilot data, a phase III trial was developed to evaluate the efficacy of American ginseng on CRF. METHODS: A multisite, double-blind trial randomized fatigued cancer survivors to 2000mg of American ginseng vs a placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the general subscale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) at 4 weeks. Changes from baseline at 4 and 8 weeks were evaluated between arms by a two-sided, two-sample t test. Toxicities were evaluated by self-report and the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) provider grading. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-four participants were enrolled from 40 institutions. Changes from baseline in the general subscale of the MFSI-SF were 14.4 (standard deviation [SD] = 27.1) in the ginseng arm vs 8.2 (SD = 24.8) in the placebo arm at 4 weeks (P = .07). A statistically significant difference was seen at 8 weeks with a change score of 20 (SD = 27) for the ginseng group and 10.3 (SD = 26.1) for the placebo group (P = .003). Greater benefit was reported in patients receiving active cancer treatment vs those who had completed treatment. Toxicities per self-report and CTCAE grading did not differ statistically significantly between arms. CONCLUSIONS: Data support the benefit of American ginseng, 2000mg daily, on CRF over an 8-week period. There were no discernible toxicities associated with the treatment. Studies to increase knowledge to guide the role of ginseng to improve CRF are needed.",

The times-dependent steaming effect of P. quinquefolius is not well-characterized and there is also no official guideline on its times of steaming. In this paper, a UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS method was developed for the qualitative profiling of multi-parametric metabolic changes of raw P. quinquefolius during the repetitious steaming process. Our method was successful in discriminating the differentially multi-steamed herbs. Meantime, the repetitious steaming-inducing chemical transformations in the preparation of black American ginseng (American ginseng that was subjected to 9 cycles of steaming treatment) were evaluated by this UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS based chemical profiling method. Under the optimized UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS conditions, 29 major ginsenosides were unambiguously identified and/or tentatively assigned in both raw and multi-steamed P. quinquefolius within 19 min, among them 18 ginsenosides were detected to be newly generated during the preparatory process of black American ginseng. The mechanisms involved were further deduced to be hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation and addition reactions of the original ginsenosides in raw P. quinquefolius through analyzing mimic 9 cycles of steaming extracts of 14 pure reference ginsenosides. Our novel steaming times-dependent metabolic profiling approach represents the paradigm shift in the global quality control of multi-steamed P. quinquefolius products."

Therefore, numerous research studies are by and large focused on finding more efficient therapy, both new medicines for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as supplements that could serve as an addition to conventional treatment modalities. A variety of herbal preparations have been shown to have modest short-term beneficial effects on glycemia, but of these, the best studied is American ginseng (AG). AG has been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes through increasing post-prandial insulin levels and decreasing postprandial glycemic response. However, high variability in ginsenosides may result in just as high variability in antidiabetic efficacy of over-the-counter ginseng products. Therefore, the availability of standardized extracts of AG could assist greatly in advancing our knowledge on the role of this traditionally used herb and result in a wider application of ginseng product in diabetes management. The aim of this review is to outline the efficacy and safety of American ginseng for AG preparations on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as to increase awareness of the evidence supporting the use of these therapies in diabetes care.",

      "abstract": "American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) has recognized neurocognitive effects, and a ginsenoside-rich extract of the root of the plant has been shown to improve cognitive functions in young adults. This study aimed at assessing the chemical and sensory profiles of a UHT-treated, low-lactose functional milk containing American ginseng. Individual ginsenosides in the milk were analyzed by HPLC. Descriptive sensory analysis was performed by a trained panel to quantitatively document sensory changes resulting from the addition of ginseng and the UHT process on flavored and unflavored milks. Consumer acceptance of the product was also investigated. Total ginsenoside content in the UHT-treated milk enriched with the ginseng extract after UHT process treatment was 7.52 mg/100 g of milk, corresponding to a recovery of 67.6% compared with the content in the unprocessed extract. The intake of 150 to 300 mL of this ginseng-enriched milk provides the amount of total ginsenosides (11.5 to 23 mg) necessary to improve cognitive function after its consumption. Both the presence of ginsenosides and their thermal treatment affected some sensory properties of the milk, most notably an increase in bitterness and metallic taste, the appearance of a brownish color, and a decrease in milky flavor. Levels of brown color, bitterness, and metallic taste were highest in the industrially processed ginseng-enriched milk. The bitterness attributable to ginseng extract was reduced by addition of vanilla flavor and sucralose. A consumer exploratory study revealed that a niche of consumers exists who are willing to consume this type of product.",

If populations within a species are adapted to local climate, directional change away from mean climatic conditions may negatively affect fitness of populations throughout the species' range. METHODS: Adaptive differentiation to temperature was tested for in American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) by reciprocally transplanting individuals from two populations, originating at different elevations, among temperature treatments in a controlled growth chamber environment. Fitness-related traits were measured in order to test for a population × temperature treatment interaction, and key physiological and phenological traits were measured to explain population differences in response to temperature. KEY RESULTS: Response to temperature treatments differed between populations, suggesting genetic differentiation of populations. However, the pattern of response of fitness-related variables generally did not suggest 'home temperature' advantage, as would be expected if populations were locally adapted to temperature alone. CONCLUSIONS: Failure consistently to detect a 'home temperature' advantage response suggests that adaptation to temperature is complex, and environmental and biotic factors that naturally covary with temperature in the field may be critical to understanding the nature of adaptation to temperature.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) root health benefits include treatment of type 2 diabetes and this study evaluated the hypoglycemic effects of American red ginseng (ARG). ARG roots have increased bioactive phenolic contents, such as cinnamic acid and ferulic acid during the steaming process. The antihyperglycemic effects of methanol fraction extract of ARG, ferulic acid, and cinnamic acid were examined using a type 2 diabetic mouse model. The ARG treated group presented relatively lower blood glucose levels than the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the glycogen and high density lipoprotein (HDL) contents were significantly increased while levels of plasma cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration were significantly decreased in the ARG treated group. The groups treated with ferulic and cinnamic acids showed similar effects as those found in the ARG treated group. Thus, it is suggested that ARG roots, ferulic acid, and cinnamic acid have hypoglycemic effects in an animal model. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study was conducted to elucidate the hypoglycemic effects of American red ginseng (ARG) using a type 2 diabetic mouse model. ARG showed an enhanced antioxidant capacity and higher antihyperglycemia effect. The glycogen and high density lipoprotein (HDL) contents were significantly increased while levels of plasma cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration were significantly decreased in the ARG treated group.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ginseng could influence the course of the disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. C57BL/6J mice were immunized with MOG((35-55)) peptide to induce EAE. After clinical disease appeared, mice received either oral doses of an aqueous extract of ginseng (150 mg/kg body mass), or the vehicle. Clinical symptoms were recorded, and spinal cord tissue samples were analyzed for pathological signs of disease. The aqueous extract of ginseng significantly decreased (i) clinical signs of EAE, (ii) levels of circulating TNF-α, and (iii) central nervous system immunoreactive iNOS and demyelination scores, without a change in other neuropathological measures.

North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) has previously been shown to effectively prevent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and heart failure. Here, we determined whether North American ginseng can reverse established cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in cultured myocytes as well as hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in experimental heart failure secondary to coronary artery occlusion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ginseng was administered in drinking water (0.9 g/L) ad libitum to rats after 4 weeks of sustained coronary artery ligation when heart failure was established or to angiotensin II- (100 nmol/L), endothelin-1- (10 nmol/L), or phenylephrine- (10 µmol/L) induced hypertrophic cultured neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes. Echocardiographic and catheter-based measurements of hemodynamic parameters 4 weeks after starting ginseng treatment (8 weeks postinfarction) revealed nearly complete reversibility of systolic and diastolic abnormalities. Similarly, ginseng administration to hypertrophic cardiomyocytes resulted in a complete reversal to a normal phenotype after 24 hours as determined by cell surface area and expression of molecular markers. The effects of ginseng both in vivo and in cultured cardiomyocytes were associated with reversal of calcineurin activation and reduced nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFAT3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 3) in cultured myocytes. Moreover, the beneficial effect of ginseng was associated with normalization in the gene expression of profibrotic markers, including collagen (I and III) and fibronectin. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a marked ability of ginseng to reverse cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial remodeling, and heart failure, which was associated with and likely mediated by reversal of calcineurin activation. Ginseng may offer a potentially effective approach to reverse the myocardial remodeling and heart failure processes, particularly in combination with other treatment modalities.",

The aims of the present study are to evaluate the preventive effects of North American ginseng on diabetic retinopathy and cardiomyopathy and to delineate the underlying mechanisms of such effects. Models of both type 1 (C57BL/6 mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes) and type 2 diabetes (db/db mice) and age-matched and sex-matched controls were examined. Alcoholic ginseng root (200 mg/kg body weight, daily oral gavage) extract was administered to groups of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice for 2 or 4 months. Dysmetabolic state in the diabetic mice was significantly improved by ginseng treatment. In both the heart and retina of diabetic animals, ginseng treatment significantly prevented oxidative stress and diabetes-induced upregulations of extracellular matrix proteins and vasoactive factors. Ginseng treatment in the diabetic animals resulted in enhancement of stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and left ventricle pressure during systole and diastole and diminution of stroke work. In addition, mRNA expressions of atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic factor (molecular markers for cardiac hypertrophy) were significantly diminished in ginseng-treated diabetic mice. These data indicate that North American ginseng prevents the diabetes-induced retinal and cardiac biochemical and functional changes probably through inhibition of oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Although employed in Asian societies for thousands of years, the use of ginseng as an herbal medication for a variety of disorders has increased tremendously worldwide in recent years. Ginseng belongs to the genus Panax, of which there exists a variety, generally reflecting their geographic origin. North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) and Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) are two such varieties possessing a plethora of pharmacological properties, which are attributed primarily to the presence of different ginsenosides that bestow these ginsengs with distinct pharmacodynamic profiles. The many cardiovascular benefits attributed to ginseng include cardioprotection, antihypertensive effects, and attenuation of myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. Experimental studies have revealed a number of beneficial properties of ginseng, particularly in the area of cardiac protection, where ginseng and ginsenosides have been shown to protect the ischaemic and reperfused heart in a variety of experimental models. Emerging evidence also suggests that ginseng attenuates myocardial hypertrophy, thus blunting the remodelling and heart failure processes. However, clinical evidence of efficacy is not convincing, likely owing primarily to the paucity of well designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials. Adding to the complexity in understanding the cardiovascular effects of ginseng is the fact that each of the different ginseng varieties possesses distinct cardiovascular properties, as a result of their respective ginsenoside composition, rendering it difficult to assign a general, common cardiovascular effect to ginseng. Additional challenges include the identification of mechanisms (likely multifaceted) that account for the effects of ginseng and determining which ginsenoside(s) mediate these cardiovascular properties. These concerns notwithstanding, the potential cardiovascular benefit of ginseng is worthy of further studies in view of its possible development as a cardiovascular therapeutic agent, particularly as adjunctive therapy to existing medications.",

RESULTS: Glucose-induced oxidative stress detected by intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, superoxide anion generation and DNA damage in HUVECs were significantly prevented by ginseng. Treatment of HUVECs with ginseng further led to significant prevention of glucose-induced NF-κB activation. Glucose-induced increase in fibronectin (FN), EDB(+)FN (a splice variant of FN), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNAs and protein levels were also prevented by ginseng treatment. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that American ginseng prevented glucose-induced damage in the HUVECs through its antioxidant properties.",

The extract contained Rg1 (347.3 ± 99.7 μg g(-1), dry weight), Re (8280.4 ± 792.3 μg g(-1)), Rb1 (1585.8 ± 86.8 μg g(-1)), Rc (32.9 ± 8 μg g(-1)), Rb2 (62.6 ± 10.6 μg g(-1)) and Rd (90.4 ± 3.2 μg g(-1)). The GE had a dose-dependent effect on 3T3-L1 cell growth, the LC50 value was determined to be 40.3 ± 5 μg ml(-1). Cell cycle analysis showed modest changes in the cell cycle. No significant changes observed in both G1 and G2/M phases, however there was a significant decrease (P < .05) in the S phase after 24 and 48 h treatment. Apoptotic cells were modest but significantly (P < .05) increased after 48 h (3.2 ± 1.0%) compared to untreated control cells (1.5 ± 0.1%). Lipid acquisition was significantly reduced (P < .05) by 13 and 22% when treated at concentrations of 20.2 and 40.3 μg ml(-1) compared to untreated control cells. In relation to adiponectin activation, western blot analysis showed that the protein expression was significantly (P < .05) increased at concentrations tested. A quantified GE reduced the growth of 3T3-L1 cells, down-regulated the accumulation of lipid and up-regulated the expression of adiponectin in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell model."

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from January 1966 to September 2009 combining the key words common cold or influenza with echinacea, garlic, ginseng, probiotics, vitamin C, and zinc. Clinical trials and prospective studies were included. MAIN MESSAGE: For prevention, vitamin C demonstrated benefit in a large meta-analysis, with possibly increased benefit in patients subjected to cold stress. There is inconsistent evidence for Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) and North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius). Allicin was highly effective in 1 small trial. For treatment, Echinacea purpurea is the most consistently useful variety; it was effective in 5 of 6 trials. Zinc lozenges were effective in 5 of 9 trials, likely owing to dose and formulation issues. Overall, the evidence suggests no benefit from probiotics for prevention or treatment of the common cold. CONCLUSION: Vitamin C can be recommended to Canadian patients for prevention of the common cold. There is moderate evidence supporting the use of Echinacea purpurea and zinc lozenges for treatment. Ginseng and allicin warrant further research.",

American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, was subjected to gamma irradiation. PCNB residues were analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection and mass spectrometry. Eighty percent of PCNB (100 ppm) in a methanol aqueous solution was degraded by 5 kGy irradiation, and the primary degradation product was pentachloroaniline. Furthermore, contaminated PCNB (3.7 ppm) in ginseng were reduced to 0.2 ppm after 20 kGy irradiation. The IC(50) for treatment of Sclerotium rolfsii with 20 kGy irradiated PCNB was about 2.7 times higher than that for treatment with unirradiated PCNB. The survival rate of mouse fibroblast L929 cells treated with 20 kGy irradiated PCNB was about 12.9% higher than that of L929 cells treated with unirradiated PCNB. Additionally, after 20 kGy irradiation, less than 5% reduction of contents of ginsenoside Rb1 and Re were observed, and amounts of ginsenosides Rc, Rd, and Rg1 were not reduced significantly. The minimal gamma dose for microbial decontamination was 10 kGy. Therefore, gamma irradiation can be used for both PCNB photodegradation and microbial decontamination of ginseng without obvious loses of ginsenoside contents.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of ginseng preparations for the prevention of common colds in healthy adults. METHODS: Comprehensive bibliographic database, trial registry and grey literature searches were conducted up to December 2007. Randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials comparing North American (Panax quinquefolius) or Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) root extract to placebo or no treatment in healthy adults were included. Two reviewers independently applied the study selection criteria and assessed methodological quality. RESULTS: Five trials involving 747 participants were included. All five trials examined North American ginseng. The methodological quality of the trials varied widely. Ginseng preparations significantly reduced the total number of common colds by 25% compared to placebo (one trial; 95% CI: 5-45). There was a tendency toward a lower incidence of having at least one common cold or other acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the ginseng group compared to the placebo group (five trials; relative risk: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.48-1.02). Compared to placebo, ginseng significantly shortened the duration of colds or ARIs by 6.2 days (two trials; 95% CI: 3.4-9.0). CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that ginseng reduces the incidence or severity of common colds. North American ginseng appears to be effective in shortening the duration of colds or ARIs in healthy adults when taken preventatively for durations of 8-16 weeks."

A secondary aim was to evaluate toxicity. METHODS: Eligible adults with cancer were randomized in a double-blind manner, to receive American ginseng in doses of 750, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/day or placebo given in twice daily dosing over 8 weeks. Outcome measures included the Brief Fatigue Inventory, vitality subscale of the Medical Outcome Scale Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the Global Impression of Benefit Scale at 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety patients were accrued to this trial. Nonsignificant trends for all outcomes were seen in favor of the 1,000- and 2,000-mg/day doses of American ginseng. Area under the curve analysis of activity interference from the Brief Fatigue Inventory was 460-467 in the placebo group and 750 mg/day group versus 480-551 in the 1,000- and 2,000-mg/day arms, respectively. Change from baseline in the vitality subscale of the SF-36 was 7.3-7.8 in the placebo and the 750-mg/day arm, versus 10.5-14.6 in the 1,000- and 2,000-mg/day arms. Over twice as many patients on ginseng perceived a benefit and were satisfied with treatment over those on placebo. There were no significant differences in any measured toxicities between any of the arms. CONCLUSION: There appears to be some activity and tolerable toxicity at 1,000-2,000 mg/day doses of American ginseng with regard to cancer-related fatigue. Thus, further study of American ginseng is warranted.",

Maximum development of brown, necrotic spots occurred 4 to 5 days after inoculation on attached and detached ginseng leaflets. Of 15 plant species tested, only American ginseng was susceptible to applications of spore inoculum or spore germination fluid. The phytotoxic activity of the spore germination fluid was destroyed by heat and treatment with proteinase A. The phytotoxic factor was retained by an ultrafiltration membrane with a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Purification of the phytotoxic protein, named AP-toxin, was performed by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Bioactive fractions eluted as a single peak. By comparison with protein standards, a molecular mass of 35 kDa was estimated for the native protein. The denatured protein toxin also had a mass of 35 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Production of the protein toxin was induced on American ginseng leaflets and water extracts of ginseng leaves but not on leaves of other nonhost plants and their water extracts. The results show that A. panax produces a host-specific, proteinaceous toxin during colonization and pathogenesis of ginseng leaves."

Regular exercise results in acute physiologic stress that affects the immune response. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of daily consumption of a standardized ginsenoside-containing North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) extract on immune function before, during, and after a moderate-exercise protocol in healthy sedentary men. Ten healthy males were randomized to receive either ginseng (1125 mg.d-1) or placebo for 35 days. After a 3 month washout period, subjects received the opposite treatment for another 35 days. An exercise test and blood collection were performed at the end of each treatment period. Immune parameters and blood hormone levels were measured before, during, and after the exercise stress protocol. Ginseng treatment reduced the peripheral blood concentration of CD8+ T cells and increased mitogen-stimulated T cell production of interleukin-2 ex vivo. Ginseng had no effect on total white blood cell counts; on concentrations of neutrophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, CD16+, CD20+); on lymphocyte proliferation; or on neutrophil oxidative burst. Ginseng did not significantly affect exercise-induced changes in plasma concentrations of lactate, insulin, cortisol, or growth hormone. The consumption of ginseng for 5 weeks had a limited effect on the immune response to an acute exercise protocol.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is prevalent among HIV-infected patients to reduce the toxicity of antiretroviral therapy. Ginseng has been used for treatment of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, a common side effect of some HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PI). However, it is unknown whether American ginseng (AG) can reverse insulin resistance induced by the PI indinavir (IDV), and whether these two agents interact pharmacologically. We evaluated potential pharmacokinetic interactions between IDV and AG, and assessed whether AG improves IDV-induced insulin resistance. METHODS: After baseline assessment of insulin sensitivity using the insulin clamp technique, healthy volunteers received IDV 800 mg q8 h for 3 days and then IDV and AG 1g q8h for 14 days. IDV pharmacokinetics and insulin sensitivity were assessed before and after AG co-administration. RESULTS: There was no difference in the area-under the plasma-concentration-time curve after the co-administration of AG, compared to IDV alone (n = 13). Although insulin-stimulated glucose disposal per unit of insulin (M/I) decreased by an average of 14.8 +/- 5.9% after 3 days of IDV (from 0.113 +/- 0.012 to 0.096 +/- 0.014 mg/kgFFM/min per muU/ml of insulin, p = 0.03, n = 11), M/I remained unchanged after co-administration of IDV and AG. CONCLUSION: IDV decreases insulin sensitivity, which is unaltered by AG co-administration. AG does not significantly affect IDV pharmacokinetics.",

Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng root extract) standardized to contain 80% poly-furanosyl-pyranosyl-saccharides is purported to be effective in adult upper respiratory tract infection but has not been evaluated yet in a pediatric population. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to document the safety and tolerability of 2 weight-based dosing schedules (standard dose versus low dose versus placebo) in children. We also used the Canadian Acute Respiratory Infection Flu Scale, a quantitative scoring sheet for measuring the severity and duration of upper respiratory symptoms, to establish the SD of the treatment effect to allow sample-size calculations for future clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind dose-finding 3-arm trial (2 dosing schedules of American ginseng extract with 1 placebo control) during the winter months (November 2005 to March 2006) in children 3 to 12 years of age. RESULTS: Seventy-five subjects were prerecruited from the general population in Edmonton. Of these, 46 subjects developed an upper respiratory tract infection and were randomly assigned (15 standard dose, 16 low dose, and 15 placebo), with 1 subject withdrawing from the low-dose arm before beginning the intervention. No serious adverse events were reported. The frequency, severity, and degree of association between the intervention and reported adverse events were not significantly different among each of the 3 treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Standard doses of ginseng were well tolerated and merit additional evaluation with regard to treatment of pediatric upper respiratory tract infection.",

      "abstract": "American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L., Araliaceae) possesses anti-cancer potential and is one of the most commonly used herbal medicines in the United States. Ginsenoside Rg3, one of the saponins in American ginseng, has been shown to inhibit tumor growth. In this study, we sought to characterize the downstream genes targeted by American ginseng extracts in HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cells. We first demonstrated that the content of Rg3 in American ginseng steamed at 120 degrees C for 2 h (referred to as S2h) was significantly increased when compared with that of the unsteamed ginseng. Both S2h and Rg3 exhibited antiproliferative effects on HCT-116 cells. Using the Affymetrix high density genechips containing more than 40,000 genes and ESTs, the gene expression profiling of HCT-116 cells were assayed. Microarray data indicated that the expression levels of 76 genes were changed significantly after treatment with S2h or Rg3, whereby it was found that 52 of the 76 genes were up-regulated while the remaining 24 were down-regulated. Ingenuity pathways analysis of top functions affected by both S2h and Rg3 were carried out. The most effected pathway is the Ephrin receptor pathway. To validate the microarray data, quantitative real-time PCR of six candidate target genes was conducted, whereby it was found that three genes were up-regulated (AKAPA8L, PMPCB and PDE5A) and three were down-regulated (PITPNA, DUS2L and RIC8A). Although further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action, our findings should expand the understanding of the molecular framework of American ginseng as an anti-cancer agent.",

American ginseng induces phase 2 and antioxidant enzymes in vitro and might increase the clearance of zidovudine and/or enhance antioxidant activity. Ten healthy volunteers received 300 mg of zidovudine orally before and after 2 weeks of treatment with a ginsenoside-enriched American ginseng extract 200 mg twice daily. This ginseng extract induced the phase 2 enzyme quinone reductase with an average concentration of doubling of enzyme activity of 190 microg/mL. Total ginsenoside content was 8.5 +/- 0.5%. Pharmacokinetic profiles of zidovudine and oxidative stress marker concentrations were measured post-zidovudine dose. American ginseng does not significantly affect the formation clearance of zidovudine to its glucuronide (ratio post- to pre-American ginseng = 1.17; 90% confidence interval: 0.95-1.45; P = .21), total clearance (ratio = 0.97; 0.82-1.14; P = .70), or plasma zidovudine AUC0-8 (ratio = 1.03; 0.87-1.21; P = .77).

Thermal treatment of ginseng leaf resulted in production of both Rh2 and Rg3 content that was confirmed by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Flow cytometry of cells stained with annexin V - fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide showed that the LFRh2 significantly (p < or = 0.05) increased apoptosis (18% +/- 0.4%) after 23 h at a concentration that inhibited cell viability by 50% (LC50 (72 h) = 52 microg/mL. In comparison, a similar significant (p < or = 0.05) increase in apoptotic cell numbers occurred at 41 h of exposure for pure ginsenoside standards, PD (LC50 (72 h) = 13 microg/mL), PT (LC50 (72 h) = 19 microg/mL), and Rh2 (LC50 (72 h) = 15 microg/mL). Although no further increase in apoptosis was observed in THP-1 cells after exposure to increasing concentrations of LFRh2 and pure Rh2, PD, and PT standards, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of necrotic cells did occur after exposure of cells to different ginsenosides at elevated concentrations. THP-1 caspase-3 activity was greatest (p <or= 0.05) with Rh2 (7.6 +/- 1.1 nmol/L pNA), followed by LFRh2 (5.9 +/- 1.0 nmol/L pNA) and PT (5.0 +/- 0.8 nmol/L pNA), whereas PD was similar to control cells. We define for the first time the proportion of apoptotic to necrotic events that characterize the relative cytotoxicity and reduced cell proliferation of different ginsenosides in cultured THP-1 cells. Moreover, thermal treatment of North American ginseng leaf produced a marked transformation of ginsenoside, largely attributable to an increase in Rh2 content. This change was associated with cytotoxic properties in THP-1 cell that were related to alterations in cell membrane properties, which were also obtained with the pure ginsenosides PD, PT, and Rh2.",

In this study, we compared the effects of a diet containing rosiglitazone to a diet containing ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) in male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Animals were assigned to one of three diets: control, rosiglitazone (0.1 g/1 kg diet), or ginseng (10 g/1 kg diet). During the 11-week study, body weight, food intake, organ weight, blood glucose, plasma cholesterol, and plasma triglyceride levels were evaluated. Animals treated with rosiglitazone or ginseng exhibited increased body weight (p<0.05) and decreased kidney weight (p<0.05) compared to control animals. The rosiglitazone group demonstrated decreased food intake and plasma triglyceride levels versus the other groups (p<0.05). The ginseng group revealed decreased cholesterol levels relative to the control group (p<0.05). Furthermore, ginseng and rosiglitazone had marked effects on the expression of genes involved in PPAR actions and triglyceride metabolism compared to controls. In conclusion, ginseng modified the diabetic phenotype and genes associated with diabetes in the male ZDF rat. These data are encouraging, and warrant further research to determine the therapeutic value of this medicinal herb in treating human diabetes.",

The content of ginsenoside Rg3, a previously recognized anticancer compound, increased significantly when the root was steamed at 120 degrees C for 0.5 - 3 h. The antiproliferative effects of unsteamed and steamed (120 degrees C for 1 h and 2 h) American ginseng root extracts were assayed by the modified trichrome stain (MTS) method using three cancer cell lines (SW-480, HT-29, NSCLC). Heat-processing increased the antiproliferative effect of American ginseng significantly, and the activity of the extract from roots steamed for 2 h was greater than that of roots steamed for 1 h. Chemical constituents and antiproliferative activities of white and red Asian ginseng have also been evaluated. Five representative ginsenosides, Rb1, Rd, Re, Rg2 and Rg3, were studied. Ginsenoside Rg3 had the most potent effect. The antiproliferative activities of red American ginseng are augmented when ginsenoside Rg3 is increased.",

An inhibitory effect of hot water-extracted American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) root on cell proliferation was demonstrated using MCF-7 human breast cancer cells treated with a wide concentration range of the ginseng extract (GE) for 6 days. The effects of GE were concentration-dependent with an IC50 of 0.49 microg/microl and the minimum exposure time to elicit an inhibitory response was 24 hours. Using an antibody microarray, it was determined that several key cell survival proteins were altered in GE-treated cells, including several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. A GE-induced decrease in phospho-MEK1/2 and -ERK1/2 and an increase in phospho-Raf-1 were observed and verified using Western blot analysis. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expression of the Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) was shown to be transiently, yet significantly, upregulated following GE treatment. These results suggest that American ginseng may act to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation by increasing the expression of RKIP, resulting in inhibition of the MAPK pathway. This novel mechanism has implications in the potential prevention and treatment of breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Heat-processed Asian ginseng roots (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer), also known as \"red ginseng\" in Asia, are reported to have more bioactivity than the no-processed white ginseng roots. Therefore, American fresh ginseng roots (Panax quinquefolius L.) were processed to the red ginseng and examined changes in bioactivity during heating process. The fresh America ginseng roots were steamed at 100 degrees C for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, and their bioactivities were examined by analyzing the content of ginsenosides and total phenolics, and measuring DPPH and superoxide radical scavenging acivity and their protective effects on V79-4 cells viability and lipid peroxidation. The heating treatment proportionally increased total ginsenosides (4.97%, w/w) content compared with white ginseng (3.27%) and total phenolics from 444.5 mg GAE/100 g to 489.6-574.2 mg GAE/100 g. The antioxidant activity also increased from 285 mg/100 g (vitamin C equivalent) to 353-487 mg/100 g. Heated ginseng showed high levels of DPPH radical scavenging activity (59.5-88.5%) and the high level of superoxide radical scavenging activity (44.2-90.9%). The heated ginseng protected cell viability against H2O2-induced oxidative damage, and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase by dose dependently in V79-4 cells.",

      "abstract": "American ginseng root (Panax quinquefolius) has a number of purported therapeutic effects, including inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. The ability of environmentally relevant heavy metals to alter ginseng effects on cancer cell growth was the subject of this study. A water extract of American ginseng root was applied alone or in combination with physiologically relevant doses of either lead (Pb) or arsenite to MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro and effects on cell proliferation were determined. Ginseng alone produced a significant dose-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation starting at 0.5 mg ml(-1). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 2.5 microM arsenite significantly decreased MCF-7 cell proliferation (p < 0.01). When cells were treated with arsenite (1.25 or 2.5 microM) in combination with ginseng extract (0.5 mg ml(-1)), there was an apparent synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation. Treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with 50 microM Pb significantly decreased cell proliferation relative to control (p < 0.01), and concomitant ginseng and Pb treatment did not lead to a further decrease. These results suggest that contaminant heavy metals, some of which have been detected in ginseng root extracts or commercial ginseng preparations, may alter the biological activity of ginseng.",

      "abstract": "Certain ginsenosides, also known as triterpene glycosides, have been recently reported to have a characteristic effect on cultured intestinal and leukemia cell growth. Ginsenoside aglycones 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PD), 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PT), and ginsenoside Rh2 have been identified as having a strong effect on reducing cell viability. Furthermore, ginsenoside Rh2 is thought to be a rare ginsenoside not found in all ginseng products. Rather, Rh2 has been recently reported to be a breakdown product of thermal processing of North American ginseng. In this study, pure ginsenosides PD, PT, Rh2 standards and an enriched Rh2 fraction derived from ginseng leaf were tested in cultured Caco-2 cells for relative cytotoxic potency. PD and Rh2 LC50 were similar after 24 to 72 h, whereas a drop in PT LC50 occurred later at 48 and 72 h. Furthermore, PD and Rh2 affected membrane integrity as indicated by LDH secretion earlier than PT and the enriched Rh2 fraction (P < or = 0.05). Ginsenoside Rh2 showed the greatest (P < or = 0.05) build up of necrotic cells (18.3 +/- 0.1%) at the respective LC50 after 24 h and PD (21.3 +/- 0.3%) showed the largest effect after 44 h of exposure. The effect on apoptotic cells at 44 h of treatment were significantly different (P < or = 0.05) for Rh2 (21 +/- 0.4%), PD (14.6 +/- 0.1%), enriched Rh2 leaf fraction (9.9 +/- 0.6%), and PT (2.3 +/- 0.1%) treatments. Caco-2 caspase-3 activity was different between ginsenoside exposure; Rh2 (10.6 +/- 0.3 nM pNA) had the greatest (P < or = 0.05) activity followed by the enriched Rh2 leaf fraction (8.3 +/- 0.2 nM pNA), PT (7.3 +/- 0.3 nM pNA). The PD (4.8 +/- 0.04 nM pNA) treatment was similar to untreated cells (4.3 +/- 0.05 nM pNA) in caspase-3 activity. These results show variable bioactive response in cultured intestinal cell to specific ginsenosides and an enriched Rh2 North American ginseng extract which may be explained on basis of hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance.",

      "abstract": "The estrogenic activity of ginseng has been the subject of conflicting reports. Cell proliferation, induction of estrogen-responsive genes, and isolated cases of adverse reactions such as postmenopausal vaginal bleeding and gynecomastia have been reported after ginseng treatment. Other studies report antiproliferative effects with no induction of estrogen-responsive genes. We developed estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and ER alpha competitive binding assays using recombinant receptors and [(3)H]-17 alpha-estradiol to detect phytoestrogens in extracts of Asian ginseng root (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) and American ginseng root (Panax quinquefolius L.). Root extracts contained substances that bound both receptor isoforms. These substances had a two to three times greater affinity for ER alpha. Significantly higher binding was found in methanol extracts than in hot water extracts. Subsequent analysis of the extracts revealed significant ER binding attributable to zearalenone, the estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species. The ER showed no binding affinity for Rb1 and Rg1, the major ginsenosides found in P. quinquefolius and P. ginseng, respectively. Thus, ginseng extraction methods, plant species tested, and mycotoxin contaminants may help to explain the disparate literature reports. The prevalence and health significance of fungal contamination in herbal products used for medicinal purposes should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "Eight botanical preparations that are commonly used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms were tested for estrogenic activity. Methanol extracts of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), chasteberry (Vitex agnus-castus L.), and hops (Humulus lupulus L.) showed significant competitive binding to estrogen receptors alpha (ER alpha) and beta (ER beta). With cultured Ishikawa (endometrial) cells, red clover and hops exhibited estrogenic activity as indicated by induction of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and up-regulation of progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA. Chasteberry also stimulated PR expression, but no induction of AP activity was observed. In S30 breast cancer cells, pS2 (presenelin-2), another estrogen-inducible gene, was up-regulated in the presence of red clover, hops, and chasteberry. Interestingly, extracts of Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) and North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) induced pS2 mRNA expression in S30 cells, but no significant ER binding affinity, AP induction, or PR expression was noted in Ishikawa cells. Dong quai [Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels] and licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) showed only weak ER binding and PR and pS2 mRNA induction. Black cohosh [Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nutt.] showed no activity in any of the above in vitro assays. Bioassay-guided isolation utilizing ER competitive binding as a monitor and screening using ultrafiltration LC-MS revealed that genistein was the most active component of red clover. Consistent with this observation, genistein was found to be the most effective of four red clover isoflavones tested in the above in vitro assays. Therefore, estrogenic components of plant extracts can be identified using assays for estrogenic activity along with screening and identification of the active components using ultrafiltration LC-MS. These data suggest a potential use for some dietary supplements, ingested by human beings, in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.",

Whether this effect can be replicated with doses <3 g and administration times closer to the oral glucose challenge is unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to study the dosing and timing effects of American ginseng on postprandial glycemia. DESIGN: In a random crossover design, 12 healthy individuals [X +/- SEM age: 42 +/- 7 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2): 24.1 +/- 1.1] received 16 treatments: 0 (placebo), 1, 2, or 3 g American ginseng at 40, 20, 10, or 0 min before a 25-g oral glucose challenge. Capillary blood was collected before administration and at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min after the start of the glucose challenge. RESULTS: Two-way analysis of variance showed that the main effects of treatment and administration time were significant (P < 0.05). Glycemia was lower over the last 45 min of the test after doses of 1, 2, or 3 g ginseng than after placebo (P < 0.05); there were no significant differences between doses. The reductions in the areas under the curve for these 3 doses were 14.4 +/- 6.5%, 10.6 +/- 4.0%, and 9.1 +/- 6%, respectively. Glycemia in the last hour of the test and area under the curve were significantly lower when ginseng was administered 40 min before the challenge than when it was administered 20, 10, or 0 min before the challenge (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: American ginseng reduced postprandial glycemia in subjects without diabetes. These reductions were time dependent but not dose dependent: an effect was seen only when the ginseng was administered 40 min before the challenge. Doses within the range of 1-3 g were equally effective.",
