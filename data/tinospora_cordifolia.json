      "abstract": "The use of metal nanoparticles is gaining popularity owing to their low cost and high efficacy. We focused on green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Tinospora cordifolia (Tc) leaf extracts. The structural characteristics of Tc nanoparticles (TcAgNPs) were determined using several advanced techniques. Pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, were evaluated through in vitro studies. In the results, the change in sample color from yellow to brown after adding silver nitrate revealed the synthesis of TcAgNPs, and the UV-visible spectrum confirmed their formation. X-ray diffraction studies showed the presence of reducing agents and the crystalline nature of the nanoparticles. Fourier-transform infrared spectra revealed the existence of essential secondary metabolites, which act as reducing/capping agents and stabilize the nanoparticles. The size of the TcAgNPs was small (range 36-168 nm) based on the measurement method. Their negative zeta potential (-32.3 mV) ensured their stability in water suspensions. The TcAgNPs were predominantly spherical, as evidenced from scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Atomic absorption spectroscopy data further revealed the conversion of silver nitrate into silver nanoparticles, and thermogravimetric analysis data showed their thermal stability. The TcAgNPs showed significant DPPH/ABTS radical scavenging ability in a concentration-dependent manner (25-100 µg/mL). Membrane lysis assays showed an effective anti-inflammatory activity of the TcAgNPs. Furthermore, the TcAgNPs showed potent antibacterial effects against multidrug-resistant bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus). The TcAgNPs treatment also exhibited antibiofilm activity against bacterial strains, in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate the structural characteristics of green-synthesized TcAgNPs using advanced techniques. TcAgNPs can be developed as potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial drugs."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a benign, chronic inflammatory disease with no effective treatment and high relapse rate. The pathophysiology is poorly understood. Tinosporin, an immunomodulator obtained from Tinospora cordifolia, is known to be useful in treating immune-mediated diseases. We report our experience of using Tinosporin for IGM and the effectiveness of this \"steroid-free\" regimen. Methods: We analysed the clinicopathological characteristics of patients diagnosed with IGM on histopathology during January 2018 and December 2022. Tinosporin tablet (500 mg Guduchi stem extract) was prescribed for 3-6 months; data were collected from electronic medical records and analysed in SPSS v-29. Results: Of 315 patients, 132 had complete clinical records. Median age was 39 years (25-77), and 107 (81.7%) were premenopausal. Seventy-eight (59.09%) had clinical suspicion of malignancy. On imaging, 84 (63.64%) were BIRADS 4/5 lesions. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed to 101 patients. Tinosporin tablets were prescribed to 91 patients. Symptomatic response was seen in 72 (79.12%). Five patients did not achieve response, while 14 patients (15.38%) were lost to follow-up. At a median follow-up of 36 months (14-62 months), only 2 patients on Tinosporin had recurrence. None of the patients needed surgical intervention other than diagnostic biopsy or control of infection, and none received steroids. Conclusion: IGM is a benign, often self-limiting disorder. However, it mimics malignancy in 60% cases, and histology clinches the diagnosis. We report the efficacy of steroid-free management of IGM with immunomodulatory herbal origin phytopharmaceutical drug Tinosporin. It is safe, inexpensive and effective. Large volume excisions or mastectomies can be reserved for severe and refractory cases.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of some conditions such as high blood sugar, high blood triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, abdominal obesity, and high blood pressure. Introducing a drug or a food that manages the majority of these medical conditions is invaluable. Tinospora cordifolia, known as guduchi and giloy, is a medicinal herb in ayurvedic medicine that is used in the treatment of various diseased conditions and also as a food for the maintenance of health. Here, we reviewed the current evidence supporting the role of giloy in the development and treatment of metabolic syndrome components. Appropriate articles that have been published until May 2024 were carefully extracted from PubMed, Scopus, and WOS databases to write a narrative review systematically. Gathered data showed the beneficial effects of giloy on metabolic syndrome components: hyperlipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and especially diabetes mellitus. As diabetes and insulin resistance seem to be a central feature of metabolic syndrome and in turn, can cause dyslipidemia, obesity, and, atherosclerosis, these beneficial effects are predictable with the anti-diabetogenic property of giloy. In this review, the main mechanisms of action of giloy in metabolic syndrome components are discussed. Based on the results, although giloy has been less investigated, considerable studies provide evidence of its beneficial effects on different components of metabolic syndrome. Relevant clinical trials are necessary to validate the mentioned effects, safety, and optimum dose of this herbal medicine and its components in managing different components of metabolic syndrome and transition from bench to bedside.",

      "abstract": "Oral cancer is a global health concern, particularly because of its aggressive tissue invasion and metastases, holding 16th position on occurrence among all carcinoma worldwide. The aberrated transcription factor NF-κB1 influences development and spread of oral cancer, making it a potential therapeutic target. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of a few natural compounds from Artocarpus heterophyllus, Tinospora cordifolia, and Glycosmis pentaphylla in the treatment of oral cancer. Two FDA-approved drugs (5-fluorouracil, Docetaxel) and 16 natural compounds, including Artocarpin, Artocarpanone, Cycloartocarpin from Artocarpus heterophyllus; Berberine, Hydrastine, Magnoflorine, Palmatine Chloride, Tetrahydropalmatine from Tinospora cordifolia; and 5-Hydroxyarborinine, 5-Hydroxynoracronycine, 1-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone, Des-N-methylacronycine, Des-N-methylnoracronycine, Kokusagenine, Noracronycin, Skimmianine from Glycosmis pentaphylla were examined using in-silico techniques. Among the 16 natural compounds studied, Hydrastine shown the highest binding energy (-6.87 kcal/mol) against NF-κB1, surpassing all other drugs, including the standards 5-fluorouracil (-4.04 kcal/mol) and docetaxel (-2.4 kcal/mol). Further molecular dynamics simulations and in-vitro experiments verified Hydrastine's exceptional anti-cancer activity. The results of in-vitro were well-aligned with the findings of in-silico, revealing considerable cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and cell cycle arrest. The findings revealed natural compounds' potential as safer, more effective alternatives to current cancer therapeutics, opening up new avenues for oral cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation (SD) due to an unhealthy lifestyle poses an oxidative challenge and is closely associated with an increased risk and prevalence of different metabolic disorders. Although the negative consequences of SD are well reported on mental health little is known about its detrimental effects on liver function and lipid metabolism. Tinospora cordifolia is reported for its hepatoprotective activity in different pre-clinical model systems. The current study was designed to elucidate the cumulative effects of aging and acute SD on liver functions, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism, and their management by butanol extract of T. cordifolia (B-TCE) using middle-aged female acyclic rats as the model system. RESULTS: Rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) Vehicle-undisturbed (VUD) (2) Vehicle-sleep deprived (VSD) (3) B-TCE pre-treated sleep-deprived (TSD) (4) B-TCE pre-treated undisturbed sleep (TUD). TSD and TUD groups were given 35 mg/kg of B-TCE once daily for 15 days followed by 12 h of sleep deprivation (6 a.m.-6 p.m.) of VSD and TSD group animals using the gentle-handling method while VUD and TUD group animals were left undisturbed. SD of VSD group animals increased oxidative stress, liver function disruption, and dyslipidemia which were ameliorated by B-TCE pre-treatment. Further, B-TCE was observed to target AMPK and its downstream lipid metabolism pathways as well as the p-Akt/cyclinD1/p-bad pathway of cell survival as possible underlying mechanisms of its hepatoprotective activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that B-TCE being a multi-component extract may be a potential agent in curtailing sleep-related problems and preventing SD-associated hepatotoxicity and dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women."

      "abstract": "Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers (Menispermaceae) is a traditional rejuvenator and a conventional medicine used to manage oxidative stress-related diseases, including those associated with the central nervous system. Decreased dextromethorphan (DEM) metabolism is necessary for high bioavailability and application against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since T. cordifolia stem extract (TCE) can potentially inhibit several metabolic enzymes, it can also enhance dextromethorphan bioavailability. This study investigates the potential of TCE to improve DEM's bioavailability and efficacy for the management of AD. In silico analysis was carried out to find the inhibition potential of phytocomponents of T. cordifolia for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The LC-MS method was revalidated for the analysis of DEM and metabolite dextrorphan (DEX) in the presence of quinidine (QN). The ratio of DEM to DEX was estimated with varying doses of TCE following pharmacokinetic analysis. Network pharmacology analysis was carried out to understand the complementary potential of phytocomponents. This was further validated in the scopolamine-induced dementia model through behavioral and histopathological analyses. TCE (100 mg/kg) for 14 days increased the DEM to DEX ratio by 2.8-fold compared to QN treatment. While T max was comparable to that of QN treatment at this dose (100 mg/kg) of TCE, it increased significantly at the higher dose (400 mg/kg) of TCE pretreatment. All other pharmacokinetic parameters were also enhanced at this dose with a 4.7-fold increase in DEM/DEX compared with QN. Network pharmacology analysis indicated the ability of TCE to target multiple factors associated with AD. Furthermore, it improved spatial memory and reduced hyperactivity in rodents better than the combination of QN and DEM."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Despite significant advancements in modern medicine, effective hepatoprotective medication with minimal side effects is still lacking. In this context. Tinospora cordifolia, an Indian Ayurvedic liana, has attracted much attention. KEY FINDINGS: Traditionally, T. cordifolia has been found to be effective in the treatment of jaundice; according to the literature, T. cordifolia is a hepatoprotective agent, and the CCl4 model is the most frequently used to evaluate its potential. Its hepatoprotective effects might be attributed to alkaloids (berberine, palmatine, and jatrorrhizine) and sinapic acid. Berberine decreases inflammation by inhibiting the proinflammatory cascade triggered by TNF-α and reduces nitrosative stress by inhibiting iNOS. T. cordifolia also exhibits anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and other activities; it is safe at concentrations up to 2000 mg/kg. Its biological action can be attributed to polyphenols, alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids, and glycosides. T. cordifolia has also been found to be an active ingredient in several polyherbal formulations used to treat chemical-mediated hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION: T. cordifolia's hepatoprotective effects are mediated by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, the management of oxidative stress, and other factors. T. cordifolia can be used to manage liver disorders and as a hepatoprotective supplement in the food industry. The bioprospecting of its alkaloids can lead to the development of novel formulations against hepatic ailments.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tinospora cordifolia (TC) a potential medicinal herb, has been ethnobotanically used as an eco-friendly supplement to manage various diseases, including cerebral fever. Earlier studies have shown that TC exhibits diverse beneficial effects, including hepatoprotective and neuroprotective effects. However, the effects of TC remain unexplored in animal models of encephalopathy including hepatic encephalopathy (HE). AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the effects of TC stem extract against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced behavioural and molecular alterations in HE rats. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The extract was preliminarily screened through phytochemical and HR-LC/MS analysis. Animals were pre-treated with TC extract at doses 30 and 100 mg/kg, orally. Following 7 days of TC pre-treatment, HE was induced by administering TAA (300 mg/kg, i. p. thrice). Behavioural assessments were performed after 56 h of TAA first dose. The animals were then sacrificed to assess biochemical parameters in serum, liver and brain. Liver tissue was used for immunoblotting and histological studies to evaluate inflammatory and fibrotic signalling. Moreover, brain tissue was used to evaluate brain edema, activation of glial cells (GFAP, IBA-1) and NF-κB/NLRP3 downstream signalling via immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis in cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: The pre-treatment with TC extract effective mitigated TAA-induced behavioural alterations, lowered serum LFT (AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin) and oxidative stress markers in liver and brain. TC treatment significantly modulated hyperammonemia, cerebral edema and preserved the integrity of BBB proteins in HE animals. TC treatment attenuated TAA-induced histological changes, tissue inflammation (pNF-κB (p65), TNF-α, NLRP3) and fibrosis (collagen, α-SMA) in liver. In addition, immunoblotting analysis revealed TC pre-treatment inhibited fibrotic proteins such as vimentin, TGF-β1 and pSmad2/3 in the liver. Our study further showed that TC treatment downregulated the expression of MAPK/NF-κB inflammatory signalling, as well as GFAP and IBA-1 (glial cell markers) in cortex and hippocampus of TAA-intoxicated rats. Additionally, TC-treated animals exhibited reduced expression of caspase3/9 and BAX induced by TAA. CONCLUSION: This study revealed promising insights on the protective effects of TC against HE. The findings clearly demonstrated that the significant inhibition of MAPK/NF-κB signalling and glial cell activation could be responsible for the observed beneficial effects of TC in TAA-induced HE rats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infections caused mild-to-moderate illness. However, a sizable portion of infected people experience a rapid progression of hyper-inflammatory and hypoxic respiratory illness that necessitates an effective and safer remedy to combat COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 150 COVID-19-positive patients with no to mild symptoms, between the age groups 19-65 years were enrolled in this randomized, open-labeled three-armed clinical trial. Among them, 136 patients completed the study with RT-PCR negative reports. The patients received herbal drugs orally (Group A (Adhatoda vasica; AV; 500 mg; n = 50); Group B (Tinospora cordifolia; TC; 500 mg; n = 43), and Group C (AV + TC; 250 mg each; n = 43)) for 14 days. Clinical symptoms, vital parameters, and viral clearance were taken as primary outcomes, and biochemical, hematological parameters, cytokines, and biomarkers were evaluated at three time points as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: We found that the mean viral clearance time was 13.92 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.85-14.99) in Group A, 13.44 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.14-14.74) in Group B, and 11.86 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.62-13.11) days in Group C. Over a period of 14 days, the mean temperature in Groups A, and B significantly decreased linearly. In Group A, during the trial period, eosinophils, and PT/INR increased significantly, while monocytes, SGOT, globulin, serum ferritin, and HIF-1α, a marker of hypoxia reduced significantly. On the other hand, in Group B hsCRP decreased at mid-treatment. Eosinophil levels increased in Group C during the treatment, while MCP-3 levels were significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: All the patients of the three-armed interventions recovered from COVID-19 and none of them reported any adverse effects from the drugs. Group C patients (AV + TC) resulted in a quicker viral clearance as compared to the other two groups. We provide the first clinical report of AV herbal extract acting as a modifier of HIF-1α in COVID-19 patients along with a reduction in levels of ferritin, VEGF, and PT/INR as the markers of hypoxia, inflammation, and thrombosis highlighting the potential use in progression stages, whereas the TC group showed immunomodulatory effects.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes has become a concern issue that affects the quality of life and can increase the risk of cardiac insufficiency elevating the threat to the life safety of patients. A recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency is diabetic cardiomyopathy, chronic hyperglycemia, and myocardial lipotoxicity which can reduce the myocardial contractile performance, and enhance the cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The cause of diabetic cardiomyopathy is multi-factorial which includes oxidative stress, insulin resistance, inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Recent clinical studies have suggested the dysbiosis of gut microbiota, secretion of metabolites, and their diffusion in to the host as to have direct detrimental effects on the cardiac contractility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present paper, we have done in silico studies including molecular interaction of phytoconstituents of Tinospora cordifolia against reactive oxygen species producing proteins. Whereas, in vitro studies were conducted on H9C2 cardiac cells including cell morphological examination, level of reactive oxygen species, cell count-viability, apoptotic status, in the presence of high glucose, trimethylamine-n-oxide, and plant extracts which were determined through cell analyzer and microscopic assays. RESULTS: The treatment of high glucose and trimethylamine-n-oxide was found to be increase the cardiac stress approximately two fold by attenuating hypertrophic conditions, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes, and Tinospora cordifolia was found to be a cardioprotective agent. CONCLUSION: Conclusively, our study has reported that the Indian medicinal plant Tinospora cordifolia has the ability to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our study can open up a new herbal therapeutic strategy against diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: From time immemorial herbal preparations are been employed for the treatment of several ailments. In recent years due to poor bioavailability the conventional herbal preparations are replaced by phytoniosomes, an advanced novel drug delivery system in which the herbal extracts are incorporated into a non-ionic surfactant to yield higher absorption and remarkable desired pharmacological activity. The present study is aimed to prepare and characterize the ethanolic leaf extract of Tinospora cordifolia (nELETC) loaded phytoniosome and to compare its antioxidant properties with ethanolic leaf extract of Tinospora cordifolia (ELETC). METHODS: The ethanolic leaf extract and ethanolic leaf extract of Tinospora cordifolia loaded phytoniosome (ELETC and nELETC) were prepared. The characterization of the prepared phytoniosomes were performed by UV-Visible spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, DLS and zeta potential. The nontoxic nature of the prepared phytoniosomes was analyzed using MTT assay in vero cell line. The antioxidant potential of ELETC and nELETC were compared by the scavenging activity of DPPH, Hydrogen peroxide and Superoxide radicals. RESULTS: The formation of ethanolic leaf extract of Tinospora cordifolia loaded phytoniosome (nELETC) was confirmed with UV-Vis spectroscopy. The SEM and TEM images confirmed the spherical shape of the nELETC with average size ranging from 600 to 1800 nm. The zeta potential showed magnitude of -65.55 to -77.83 mV and its crystalline structure was confirmed by XRD analysis. Through the FTIR spectrum presence of alcohols, alkanes, phenols, esters, aliphatic and aromatic compounds as well as alkenes and carbolic acids were identified. MTT assay establishes the non-toxic nature of the synthesized nELETC and excellent antioxidant potential was observed for nELETC than ELETC. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the ethanolic leaf extract of Tinospora cordifolia loaded phytoniosome (nELETC) will serve as a promising drug carrier in scavenging the free radicals and can be used in various biological applications."

Using the encapsulated dual doped Co-Cu TNPs, free radical assays (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl: DPPH; Hydrogen peroxide: HP & Nitric oxide: NO) were also performed. Several physicochemical properties of encapsulated TNPs were examined using a variety of characterization techniques that helps in photocatalytic and antioxidant activity. The encapsulated TNPs exhibit tetragonal crystal lattice having average particles size between 25 and 38 nm with spherical shape morphology. The bandgap of encapsulated dual doped Co-Cu TNPs was found in the range of 3.25-3.29 eV. The binding of encapsulated dual doped Co-Cu TNPs were also calculated by using XPS which confirms the presence of dopants. The photocatalytic activity was performed with using control experiment and using encapsulated dual doped Co-Cu TNPs against MO and MB dyes. The results revealed that the degradation was observed up to 100% for the both MO and MB dyes. Also, antioxidant activity of encapsulated dual doped Co-Cu TNPs was observed against the DPPH, HO and NO assays.",

      "abstract": "Scientific research has demonstrated that Tinospora cordifolia acts as an anti-aging agent in several experimental models, generating global interest in its underlying molecular mechanisms of this activity. The aim of the study was to identify the possible phytochemical compounds of T. cordifolia that might combat age-related illness through integrating network pharmacology, molecular docking techniques, and molecular dynamics (MD) study to explore their potential mechanisms of action. To carry out this study, several databases were used, including PubChem, KNApSAcK family database, PubMed, SwissADME, Molsoft, SwissTargetPrediction, GeneCards, and OMIM database. For network development and GO enrichment analysis KEGG, ShinyGo 0.77, and the STRING database were used. For better analysis, the networks were also constructed using Cytoscape 3.9.1. The Cytoscape network analyzer tool was used for data analysis, and molecular docking was done via Vina-GPU-2.0. The best compounds and AKT1 were finally subjected to MD simulation for 100 ns. The CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape identified ten key targets, commonly called hub genes, including AKT1, GAPDH, and TP53, and so on. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed the relevant biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions involved in treating aging-related disorders. KEGG pathway analysis involved neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, lipid and atherosclerosis, and cAMP signaling. The docking of 100 T. cordifolia compounds with AKT1 demonstrated good binding affinity, particularly for Amritoside, Sitagliptin, Berberine, and Piperine. Finally, the relative stability of four-hit phytochemicals was validated by MD simulation, which may be the most crucial compound for anti-aging activity. In conclusion, this study used network pharmacology, molecular docking, and MD simulation to identify the compounds in T. cordifolia and proposed a potential mechanism for anti-aging activity. These results suggest future directions for the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.",

However, some sporadic under-powered case studies have recently reported Tinospora cordifolia associated toxicity. Thus, following OECD 407 guidelines, a 28-day-repeated-dose-14-day-recovery toxicological evaluation of the aqueous extract of T. cordifolia stem (TCWE) was conducted under good laboratory practice (GLP), in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Methods: 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day of TCWE was given orally to designated treatment groups of either sex. Two separate 14-day recovery satellite groups received either vehicle control or 1000 mg/kg/day of TCWE. Results: In this study, TCWE was found safe up to a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day with no mortality or related toxicological manifestation in terms of clinical signs, ocular effects, hematology, urinalysis, clinical chemistry parameters, or macro- or microscopic changes in any organs. The satellite group did not show any adverse effect after 14-day recovery period. Thus, the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) of TCWE was determined to be 1000 mg/kg/day. Discussion: In conclusion, this study established the non-clinical safety of the aqueous extract of T. cordifolia stem, which confirms the age-old safe medicinal use of this herb, and also paves the path for future clinical research on formulations containing Tinospora cordifolia."

      "abstract": "Background: The plant Tinospora cordifolia (TC), traditionally known as guduchi or giloy, is used for a number of health conditions as a nutritional supplement and rejuvenation medicine. Its nutritional supplementary products are traditionally recommended for a wide range of health issues, including diabetes, menstruation discomfort, fever, obesity, inflammation, and more. Unfortunately, there has not been extensive research into its effectiveness in treating or managing insulin resistance, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, hormonal imbalance, and metabolic syndrome-associated polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: Consequently, the present study was designed to induce insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hormonal abnormality, hyperglycemia, and menstrual disturbance of PCOS using dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in mice and study the effect of oral TC extracts on these factors by using ancient and modern technologies. During the 21-day study, 6 mg/100 g/day of DHEA was given to female mice. Levels of glucose, insulin, lipids, and hormones were estimated. In addition to being seen with the naked eye, the morphological and microscopic changes were also observed on histology slides. Results: The study outcomes show that pretreatment with TC preparations significantly improved biochemical and histological abnormalities in female mice. Diestrus phase was only observed in DHEA-treated animals, while cornified epithelial cells were present in TC-treated mice. Pretreatment with TC satva showed significant (p < 0.001) reductions in body weight compared to placebo. Fasting blood glucose, 1-h OGTT, and 2-h OGTT levels were all significantly lower in TC satva- and oil-treated animals in comparison to the disease control group (p < 0.001). Treatment with TC extracts resulted in a normalization of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone levels (p < 0.05). Treatment with TC extract improved lipid profiles (p < 0.001), LH/FSH ratios (p < 0.01), fasting insulin levels (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p < 0.001), HOMA-Beta (p < 0.001), and QUICKI (p < 0.001). Both macroscopic and microscopic alterations were seen to be restored after TC extract treatment. After being treated with TC satva, oil, and hydroalcoholic extract, the severity of PCOS decreased by 54.86%. Conclusions: These findings lead us to the conclusion that TC extracts and satva as nutritional supplements are useful for treating PCOS and associated symptoms. It is recommended that additional research be conducted to determine the molecular mechanism of action of TC nutritional supplements on PCOS-related changes in metabolic profiles. We also recommend further clinical studies to explore the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of TC nutritional supplements in treating and/or managing PCOS.",

Tinospora cordifolia and Ocimum tenuiflorum herbs have shown medicinal properties and have gained importance in modern research. AIMS: This study assessed the antimicrobial activities of Tinospora cordifolia and Ocimum tenuiflorum against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to conventional medications such as chlorhexidine and nystatin. METHODOLOGY: The S. mutans and C. albicans were grown and maintained on Columbia agar plates and yeast malt extract agar respectively. An ethanolic extract was made and subjected to rotary evaporation to remove the ethanol. The antimicrobial activity of plant extracts was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The standard drugs, 10 μg/disc nystatin and 0.12% chlorhexidine, were used as a positive control. The zone of inhibition was measured after 24 hours. RESULTS: At a concentration of 3 mgs., the zone of inhibition of 25.6 mm was found with T. cordifolia, followed by 15.8 mm with O. tenuiflorum against S. mutans, and 0.12% chlorhexidine, at 21.7 ± 0.43 mm. A zone of inhibition of 23 mm and 22.9 mm was observed in both T. cordifolia and O. tenuiflorum against C. albicans, respectively. Positive control of nystatin showed 26.1 ± 0.46 mm. CONCLUSION: Tinospora cordifolia has better antimicrobial activity against S. mutans compared to Ocimum tenuiflorum. Whereas at higher concentrations, both extracts were effective against C. albicans."

      "abstract": "Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) due to severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to life-threatening pneumonia which has been associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pathologies. Centuries-old Asian traditional medicines such as Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (WS) and Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers (TC) possess potent immunomodulatory effects and were used by the AYUSH ministry, in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we investigated WS and TC's anti-viral and immunomodulatory efficacy at the human equivalent doses using suitable in vitro and in vivo models. While both WS and TC showed immuno-modulatory potential, WS showed robust protection against loss in body weight, viral load, and pulmonary pathology in the hamster model of SARS-CoV2. In vitro pretreatment of mice and human neutrophils with WS and TC had no adverse effect on PMA, calcium ionophore, and TRLM-induced ROS generation, phagocytosis, bactericidal activity, and NETs formation. Interestingly, WS significantly suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines-induced Th1, Th2, and Th17 differentiation. We also used hACE2 transgenic mice to further investigate the efficacy of WS against acute SARS-CoV2 infection. Prophylactic treatment of WS in the hACE2 mice model showed significant protection against body weight loss, inflammation, and the lung viral load. The results obtained indicate that WS promoted the immunosuppressive environment in the hamster and hACE2 transgenic mice models and limited the worsening of the disease by reducing inflammation, suggesting that WS might be useful against other acute viral infections. The present study thus provides pre-clinical efficacy data to demonstrate a robust protective effect of WS against COVID-19 through its broader immunomodulatory activity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder causing cartilage and joint degeneration. In spite of the availability of several robust drugs like biologics, most of the patients are unresponsive, and reports of severe adverse effects following long-term use are also there. Subsequently the use of natural plant-based products in RA therapy is broadening over the years. Tinospora cordifolia is a widely used medicinal plant in Ayurveda against various inflammatory disorders including RA. However, there is very limited knowledge regarding the actual molecular events responsible for its therapeutic effect, and this has limited its acceptance among the professionals. PURPOSE: To explore the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effect of hydro-alcoholic extract from Tinospora cordifolia. METHODS: The rich polyphenol nature of the extract was elucidated using HPLC. LPS-stimulated murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was used for in vitro studies, and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was used for in vivo studies. RESULTS: The polyphenols in TCE were identified using HPLC. TCE effectively downregulated the level of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-α, PGE2, and NO) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Subsequently the upregulated expression of COX-2 and iNOS following LPS stimulation were also downregulated by TCE. Furthermore, TCE targeted the upstream kinases of the JAK/STAT pathway, a crucial inflammatory pathway. The expression of VEGF, a key angiogenic factor as well as an inflammatory mediator was also decreased following pre-treatment with TCE. The anti-arthritic effect of TCE (150 mg/kg) was evaluated in the CIA model as well. From the results of histopathology, oral administration of TCE was found to be effective in reducing the clinical symptoms of arthritis including paw edema, erythema, and hyperplasia. In vivo results validated the in vitro results and there was a significant reduction in serum level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-17, NO, and PGE2). The phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression of VEGF were also downregulated following TCE treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study provided a detailed insight into the molecular events associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effect of Tinospora cordifolia.",

      "abstract": "Naive CD4+ T cells differentiate into effector (Th1, Th2, Th17) cells and immunosuppressive (Treg) cells upon antigenic stimulation in the presence of a specific cytokine milieu. The T cell in vitro culture system provides a very efficient model to study compounds' therapeutic activity and mechanism of action. Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Hook.f. & Thomson (Family. Menispermaceae) is one of the widely used drugs in Ayurveda (ancient Indian system of medicine) for various ailments such as inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders, and cancer as well as for promoting general health. In vitro and in vivo studies on immune cells comprising dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells suggest its immune-modulating abilities. However, to date, the effect of T. cordifolia on individual purified and polarized T cell subsets has not been studied. Studying drug effects on T cell subsets is needed to understand their immunomodulatory mechanism and to develop treatments for diseases linked with T cell abnormalities. In this study, we examined the immunomodulatory activity of T. cordifolia on primary CD4+ T cells, i.e., Th1, Th17, and iTreg cells. An aqueous extract of T. cordifolia was non-cytotoxic at concentrations below 1500 µg/ml and moderately inhibited the proliferation of naive CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 for 96 h. T. cordifolia treatment of naive CD4+ T cells differentiated under Th17-polarizing conditions exhibited reduced frequency of IL-17 producing cells with inhibition of differentiation and proliferation. For the first time, in-depth genome-wide expression profiling of T. cordifolia treated naive CD4+ T cells, polarized to Th17 cells, suggests the broad-spectrum activity of T. cordifolia. It shows inhibition of the cytokine-receptor signaling pathway, majorly via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, subsequently causing inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation, proliferation, and effector function. Additionally, the molecular docking studies of the 69 metabolites of T. cordifolia further substantiate the inhibitory activity of T. cordifolia via the cytokine-receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, in vitro polarized Th1 and iTreg cells treated with T. cordifolia extract also showed reduced IFN-γ production and FoxP3 expression, respectively. This study provides insight into the plausible mechanism/s of anti-inflammatory activity of T. cordifolia involving T cells, mainly effective in Th17-associated autoimmune and inflammatory diseases."

The objective of this study is to assess the effect of G1-4A on NK cells; direct effects as well as through dendritic cell (DC) cross-talk. METHODS: NK cell phenotype and function were assessed in spleen cells treated in vitro with G1-4A or isolated from mice administered with G1-4A. Following treatment with G1-4A in vitro or in cells isolated from G1-4A treated mice (in vivo), activated NK cell phenotype was characterized as CD3-NKp46+CD69+ cells by flow cytometry; NK cell function was evaluated by IFN-γ secretion (ELISA) and cytotoxicity assay (calcein release by target cells in effector: target cells co-culture assay). RESULTS: Both in vitro as well as in vivoG1-4A treatment increased phenotypic and functional activation of NK cells. So, we wanted to determine if this was through NK-DC crosstalk or direct activation of NK cells. There was increased NK cell activation following co-culture with bone marrow derived DC matured withG1-4A in vitro or splenic DC isolated from G1-4A administered mice indicating crosstalk. G1-4A also increased activation of NK cells in (a) CD11c depleted splenic cells that was contact dependent and (b) purified NKp46+ cells that was abrogated by PKC/mTOR inhibitors indicating direct effects on NK cells. CONCLUSION: In summary, treatment with G1-4A results in phenotypic and functional activation of NK cells directly as well as through NK-DC cross talk and has the potential to be used as an immunotherapeutic agent.",

      "abstract": "The stem of Tinospora cordifolia has been traditionally used in traditional Indian systems of medicine for blood sugar control, without the knowledge of the underlying mechanism and chemical constitution responsible for the observed anti-diabetic effect. In the present study, Tinosporaside, a diterpenoid isolated from the stem of T. cordifolia, was investigated for its effects on glucose utilization in skeletal muscle cells, which was followed by determining the anti-hyperglycemic efficacy in our diabetic db/db mice model. We found that tinosporaside augmented glucose uptake by increasing the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes, upon prolonged exposure for 16 h. Moreover, tinosporaside treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B/AKT (Ser-473) and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK, Thr-172). These effects were abolished in the presence of the wortmannin and compound C. Administration of tinosporaside to db/db mice improved glucose tolerance and peripheral insulin sensitivity associated with increased gene expression and phosphorylation of the markers of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and AMPK signaling in skeletal muscle tissue. The findings revealed that tinosporaside exerted its antidiabetic efficacy by enhancing the rate of glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, mediated by PI3K- and AMPK-dependent signaling mechanisms.",

The crops thus can be improved through knowledge obtained by the study of miRNAs because of their conserved nature in gene regulation. The present study has been carried out on Tinospora cordifolia (T. cordifolia), because of its illimitable application for the treatment of various diseases. This plant has tremendous medicinal properties, yet unexplored at the molecular level, and has not received much recognition in the scientific field. Thus, here computational analysis was performed to identify T. cordifolia miRNAs using EST database. Using these miRNAs, we predicted their targets which were found to be associated with the regulation of diverse gene networks including 433 berberine biosynthesis genes in T. cordifolia. Further, selected miRNAs were validated and their expression was detected in different T. cordifolia tissues followed by expression analysis of their target mRNAs. These data were then compared with the metabolic profile of T. cordifolia with an emphasis on therapeutically important compound berberine. In this study, we did simultaneous miRNA/target gene expression and metabolome analysis which opens a new way for initiating new proposition and prioritization of miRNAs/genes/metabolites for targeted follow‑up metabolic engineering experimentations.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer has emerged as a systemic disease which targets various organs thus challenging the overall physiology of the host. Recently, we have shown that hyperactive neutrophils infiltrate various organs of tumor bearing host and contribute to gradual systemic deterioration. Therefore, taming neutrophils via potent immunomodulators could be an appropriate therapeutic approach in regulating systemic damage. Tinospora cordifolia (TC), an Ayurvedic panacea, is known for its immense medicinal values in traditional literature and recent reports have also documented its immunomodulatory potential. However, whether TC can regulate neutrophils to exert its therapeutic effectiveness has not been deciphered so far. METHODS: For the in vivo study, we utilized murine model of Dalton's Lymphoma (DL). T. cordifolia extract (TCE) treatment was scheduled at early, mid and advanced stages of tumor growth at a dose of 400 mg/kg b.w for 30 consecutive days. Effect of TCE on neutrophil infiltration was examined by immunostaining. Neutrophil elastase (NE) level in serum, ascitic fluid and various tissues was monitored by ELISA. Further, qPCR was performed to assess transcripts levels of NE, myeloperoxidase (MPO), metalloproteinases (MMP-8, MMP-9) and cathepsin G (CSTG) in various tissues. ROS level in tissue was assessed by DHE staining and organ function was assessed by histology post TCE treatment. RESULTS: Our findings showed that TC treatment significantly reduced neutrophil count in peripheral blood and their infiltration in vital organs of tumor-bearing host. Further, it ameliorated neutrophil hyperactivation by down regulating the expression of its key cargoes including NE, MPO, MMP-8, MMP-9 and CSTG at early and mid stage of tumor growth. In addition, TC treatment prevented histopathological alterations and restored the normal serum enzyme levels at different stages of tumor growth. Importantly, TC treatment also showed significant reduction in tumor burden which was accompanied by a remarkable increase in survival of the tumor-bearing mice. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that T. cordifolia could limit systemic damage via regulating neutrophil infiltration and hyperactivation which can further lead to cancer control at both prophylactic and therapeutic level.",

      "abstract": "Tinospora cordifolia, commonly known as \"Giloe\" in India, is a shrub belonging to the family Menispermaceae. It is an important medicinal plant known for its antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and antidiabetic properties and is used in the treatment of jaundice, gout, and rheumatism. Despite its economic importance, the limited information related to its genomic resources prohibits its judicious exploitation through molecular breeding or biotechnological approaches. In this study, we generated a meta-transcriptome assembly of 43,090 non-redundant transcripts by merging the RNASeq data obtained from Roche 454 GS-FLX, and Illumina platforms, and report the first transcriptome-based database for simple sequence repeats and transcription factors (\"TinoTranscriptDB\" (Tinospora cordifolia Transcriptome Database)). We annotated 26,716 (62%) of the total transcripts successfully from National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant protein (NCBI-NR), gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Swiss-Prot, and Pfam databases. This database contains information of 2620 perfect simple sequence repeats (P-SSRs) with a relative abundance of 340.12 (loci/Mb), and relative density of 6309.29 (bp/Mb). Excluding mono-nucleotides, the most abundant SSR motifs were tri-nucleotides (54.31%), followed by di-nucleotides (37.51%), tetra-nucleotides (4.54%), penta-nucleotides (3.16%) and hexa-nucleotides (0.45%). Additionally, we also identified 4,311 transcription factors (TFs) and categorized them into 55 sub-families. This database is expected to fill the gap in genomic resource availability in T. cordifolia and thus accelerate molecular breeding and related functional and other applied studies aimed towards genetic improvements of T. cordifolia and related species.",

Conflicting reports of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) necessitate the exploration of novel therapeutic interventions using bioactive natural products having the least toxicity and a holistic mode of action for the preservation of metabolic homeodynamics with aging in women. The present study was planned to investigate the effects of aging and/or a high-fat diet (HFD) on cognitive impairments and anxiety and further their management by dietary supplement with the Tinospora cordifolia stem powder (TCP). Acyclic female rats were included in this study as the model system of the perimenopause phase of women along with young 3-4 months old rats as controls. Rats were fed on with and without TCP supplemented normal chow or HFD for 12 weeks. Animals fed on a TCP supplemented normal chow showed consistent management of body weight over a 12-week regimen although their calorie intake was much higher in comparison to their age-matched controls. Post-regimen, neurobehavioral tests, such as novel object recognition and elevated plus maze, performed on these animals showed improvement in their learning and memory abilities as well as the anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, due to the presence of multiple components, TCP was observed to modulate the expression of key marker proteins to ameliorate neuroinflammation and apoptosis and promote cell survival and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions of the brain. These findings suggest that TCP supplementation in diet during the midlife transition period in women may be a potential interventional strategy for the management of menopause-associated anxiety and cognitive impairments and healthy aging."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lung tumors were induced in male BALB/c mice using B(a)P as a carcinogen. Animals were administered twice with 50 mg/kg b.wt (i.p.) dosage of B(a)P at the 2nd and 4th week of the study. Mice were orally treated with Aq.Tc and AG on alternate days at a dose of 200 mg/kg b.wt and 7.5 mg/kg b.wt, respectively, for continuous 22 weeks. RESULTS: Oral administration of animals with Aq.Tc and AG suppressed the development of lung carcinogenesis by modulating the mRNA and protein expressions of different apoptotic genes; bcl-2, bax, caspase 3, and caspase 9. The pro-apoptotic proficiency of Aq.Tc and AG was further confirmed by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis showing fragmentation in B(a)P + Aq.Tc group and smear formation in B(a)P + AG group. In contrast to the control group, an increase in tumor invasion factors such as matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 was also observed in B(a)P treated animals. Nevertheless, Aq.Tc and AG treatment effectively mitigated the B(a)P-induced upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9. The activity of the telomerase enzyme was also observed to be upregulated in B(a)P treated animals which consecutively found to get normalized with the parallel administration of Aq.Tc and AG. CONCLUSION: Aq.Tc and AG successfully mitigated the altered expression of apoptosis, metastasis, and telomerase activity-associated genes during pulmonary carcinogenesis.",

Since cerebellum regulates motor movements and balance perception of our body, therefore it may be an important target to control the age-related progression of motor dysfunctions. Dry stem powder of Tinospora cordifolia (TCP) was tested as a food supplement to elucidate its activity to attenuate age-associated locomotor dysfunctions. Intact acyclic middle-aged female rats were used in this study as the model system of the transition phase from premenopause to menopause in women along with cycling young adult rats. Normal chow or 30% High Fat Diet (HFD), supplemented with or without TCP was fed to animals for 12 weeks and then tested for locomotor performance on rotarod followed by post-sacrifice protein expression studies. In comparison to young adults, middle-aged animals showed an increase in number of falls and lesser time spent in rotarod performance test, whereas, animals given TCP supplemented feed showed improvement in performance with more pronounced effects observed in normal chow than HFD fed middle-aged rats. Further, due to its multicomponent nature TCP was found to target the expression of various markers of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, cell survival, and synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum region. The current findings suggest that TCP supplementation in the diet may prove to be a potential interventional strategy for the management of frailty and fall-associated morbidities caused by aging-related deterioration of bone mineral density, and muscle strength.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is strongly associated with the various types of disease conditions and evolving as epidemics. Hence, it is important to identify molecules that lower the triglyceride and chylomicron levels. Tinospora cordifolia is an illustrious Ayurveda drug, has proved juvenile and immunomodulatory properties. METHODS: Twenty four (24) patients having >499 mg/dL TG and 130-230 mg/dL of cholesterol were randomized and given 100 mL/day (~3.0 g) water extract of T. cordifolia (TCE) for 14 days. Basal parameters were analyzed before and after TC intervention to analyzed primary outcomes. Further, unbiased metabolomics and proteomics profiling was explored to assess the efficacy of TCE in HTG patients. RESULTS: TCE intervention decreased the levels of triglycerides, and VLDL to 380.45 ± 17.44, and 31.85 ± 5.88, and increased the HDL levels to 47.50 ± 9.05 mg/dL significantly (p < 0.05). Metabolomics analysis identified the significant alteration in 69 metabolites and 72 proteins in plasma of HTG patients. TCE intervention reduced the level of isoprostanes, ROS, BCAA, and fatty acid derivatives, significantly. The annotation databases, Metboanalyst predicted Akt and Rap1 signaling, and ECM-receptor interaction is the most affected in HTG patients. TCE intervention normalized these events by increasing the peroxisome biogenesis and modulating Akt and Rap1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: T. cordifolia intervention suppresses the baseline in HTG patients. Omics analysis showed that TCE intervention modulates the Akt and Rap signaling, and peroxisome biogenesis to control the cellular switches and signaling pathways. Hence, TCE can be used as a supplement or alternate of standard drugs being used in the management of HTG.

There are plants in the Indian medicine system having the potential for rejuvenation. In the present study, we have attempted to evaluate the capacity of aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia to regenerate beta cells from PANC-1 ductal cells. After differentiation, the characterization of β-cell phenotype was carried out using dithizone and Gomori's staining and further confirmed by mRNA expression study of insulin, Pdx-1, and carbonic anhydrase-9. Insulin production was estimated with ELISA. Aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia at 15 μg/ml concentration can effectively induce differentiation of PANC-1 cells into beta cells. The morphological observations showed brownish-colored dithizone and purple-colored Gomori's staining. The β-cells demonstrated significant mRNA expression of insulin and Pdx-1 and downregulation of carbonic anhydrase-9. The functionality of beta cells was demonstrated by 1.5-fold increase in insulin secretion in response to high glucose. Tinospora cordifolia has potential to differentiate PANC-1 ductal cells into functional beta cells and can be a lead towards non-invasive treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.",

The findings of the current study encompass the neurobehavioral as well as hormonal, and neuroinflammatory changes in serum and hypothalamus region of the brain as an outcome of acute SD and their amelioration by pre-treatment with butanol extract of Tinospora cordifolia. SD group animals showed anxiety-like behavior as evident from Elevated Plus Maze data and higher serum cortisol levels, whereas, pre-treatment with B-TCE showed anxiolytic activity and also reduced cortisol levels which was corroborated by an increase in leptin and insulin levels. Further, SD induced elevation of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1 and subsequent activation of astroglial cells in the hypothalamus was suppressed in B-TCE pre-treated animals. The current findings suggest that besides the cortical structures, hypothalamus region's synaptic plasticity and cell survival are adversely impacted by acute SD. Further active ingredients present in B-TCE may be useful for the management of SD-induced anxiety, systemic inflammation, and neuroinflammation by targeting hypothalamic BDNF-TrkB/PI3K-Akt pathways.",

OBJECTIVE: The obejctive of this experimental study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of two formulations, Tinospora cordifolia (Tc) and Phyllanthus emblica (Pe) with and without coating of Ocimum sanctum (Os). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Animal Ethics Committee approval, present experimental study was conducted to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of plant drug formulations against infection induced in mice subjected to major surgical stress. Hemisplenectomy was selected to induce major stress and the procedure for hemisplenectomy was standardized. A model of secondary fungal infection after hemisplenectomy was established followed by the treatment of mice with plant drugs and controls. They were subjected to hemisplenectomy or sham operation and 105 C. albicans were injected intravenously. The therapy continued for next 14 days. Kidneys were isolated to estimate fungal load. Fungal load of the kidneys was estimated on post-operative Day 15. RESULTS: The test formulations Tc + Pe and Tc + Pe + Os showed significant reduction in the fungal burden of kidneys as compared to hemisplenectomized control group. However, Tc alone exerted better degree of protection as compared to Tc + Pe and Tc + Pe + Os. CONCLUSION: The formulations, Tc + Pe and Tc + Pe + Os that were developed on the basis of theoretical concepts were not found to be superior to Tc. Though the individual ingredients have been shown to possess immunnostimulant activities, in combination, Pe and Os blunted the effects of Tc. The basis for this drug interaction needs further exploration. Thus, the current experimental study validates immunomodulatory role of Tc. However, the addition of Pe with bhavana of Os does not lead to any augmentation of immunomodulatory activity of Tc. This study also underlines the need to generate data on Ayurveda formulations to understand the rationality of the multi-ingredient Ayurvedic formulations."

Following the discovery of l-dopa, multiple drugs have been developed to improve the lifestyle of PD patients; however, none have been suitable for clinical use due to their multiple side effects. Tinospora cordifolia has been used in traditional medicines to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Previously, we reported the neuroprotective role of Tc via inhibition of NF-κB-associated proinflammatory cytokines against MPTP-intoxicated Parkinsonian mice. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective molecular mechanism of Tc in a rotenone (ROT)-intoxicated mouse model, using a proteomics approach. Mice were pretreated with Tc extract by oral administration, followed by ROT intoxication. Behavioral tests were performed to check motor functions of mice. Protein was isolated, and label-free quantification (LFQ) was carried out to identify differentially expressed protein (DEP) in control vs PD and PD vs treatment groups. Results were validated by qRT-PCR with the expression of target genes correlating with the proteomics data. In this study, we report 800 DEPs in control vs PD and 133 in PD vs treatment groups. In silico tools demonstrate significant enrichment of biochemical and molecular pathways with DEPs, which are known to be important for PD progression including mitochondrial gene expression, PD pathways, TGF-β signaling, and Alzheimer's disease. This study provides novel insights into the PD progression as well as new therapeutic targets. More importantly, it demonstrates that Tc can exert therapeutic effects by regulating multiple pathways, resulting in neuroprotection.",

The rats were divided into different groups namely normal control, benzo(a)pyrene (BP) treated, BP + Tinospora cordifolia (TC)-treated, BP + Arabinogalactan (A)-treated and BP + TC + A-treated groups. Significant changes were observed in the membrane dynamics of rats treated with BP. The carcinogen treatment demonstrated a marked decrease in membrane microviscosity. Also, excimer/monomer ratio and fluidity parameters of BP treated rats showed significant rise. On the other hand, combination of Tinospora cordifolia and Arabinogalactan improvised surface membrane dynamics. Moreover, micronuclei formation along with protein expression of bcl-2 showed significant increase in the lungs of BP treated rats. The combined treatment of Tinospora cordifolia and Arabinogalactan moderated the micronuclei formation in BP treated rats. Also, the combined treatment regulated the protein expressions of bcl-2 in BP-treated rats. As a result, marked improvement was noticed in apoptosis of BP treated cells treated with combination treatment. This study concludes that the Tinospora cordifolia and Arabinogalactan in combination improve the surface membrane dynamics and apoptosis in BP-treated rats.",

The starch prepared from the aqueous extract of fresh stems is used in the Indian Systems of Medicines. The plant extract prepared from T. cordifolia is a  promising source for the treatment of COVID-19. This investigation explores for the first time, the morphological details of the starch granules and its accumulation pattern along with its variability among the germplasm of T. cordifolia collected from different parts of India. Starch content was 39.80% on dry weight basis and moisture content was about 28.21%. Starch granule recovery based on stem dry weight and starch content ranged from 14.70 to 20.28% and 52.02 to 71.76%, respectively in different starch settling methods. Starch accumulation pattern in the stem was also studied in the species. Even though wide variability in starch granule shapes was observed among the germplasm, majority of the genotypes had starch granules of round or oval shape. Similarly, starch granule size also varied greatly (38.32-88.03 µm) within and among the genotypes. Significantly small sized starch granules (p = 0.05) were present in the genotype, IC 283650 and biggest (p = 0.05) starch granules were present in the genotype, IC 310610. The information generated in the present study will have application in starch industry for the inclusion of T. cordifolia as an alternative source of starch in addition to its use in Traditional Systems of Medicine.

Moreover, women, as they age, become prone to the cumulative effects of menopause such as sleep disturbances, adiposity, and inflammation which are attributed to a compromised immuno-neuro-endocrine axis. So far, no effective therapeutic remedy is available to mitigate the adverse effects of SD. The current study was aimed to elucidate the neuroprotective potential of n-Butanol fraction obtained from hydroalcoholic extract of Tinospora cordifolia stem (B-TCE). Four groups of female rats are (1) Vehicle-undisturbed sleep, (2) Vehicle-sleep deprived (between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.), (3) B-TCE oral feeding for 2 weeks and sleep deprivation, and (4) B-TCE alone undisturbed sleep group. Novel Object Recognition test was used to study cognitive impairments and Rotarod for motor coordination. Rats were then sacrificed to study the expression of various marker proteins in the hippocampus and piriform cortex regions of the brain by western blotting. SD was observed to impair the exploratory behavior and neuromuscular coordination, whereas, B-TCE pre-treatment was observed to ameliorate these behavioral functions'- impairments and further suppressed the changes in the expression of markers for synaptic plasticity, inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis pathways. The current data suggest that B-TCE may be effective in the management of acute SD-associated impairments in learning and memory functions and neuromuscular coordination.",

Therefore, in the present study, we assessed the efficacy and mechanism of action of Tinospora cordifolia extract (TC) against DKD. METHODS: The molecular interaction of the various phytoconstituents of TC with PPARγ were analyzed in silico. The effect of TC was studied on the viability, cell cycle, and gene expressions (PPARγ, TGFβ, and αSMA) in high glucose treated NRK-52E and SV40 MES13 cells. Further, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with TC for eight weeks, and the effects on different biochemical, histological and molecular parameters were studied. RESULTS: In silico analysis revealed the integration of various phytoconstituents of TC with PPARγ. It further increased PPARγ and decreased TGFβ and αSMA expressions in NRK-52E and SV40 MES13 cells. In diabetic rats, TC improved the fasting blood glucose, serum urea, and creatinine levels. It also lowered the urine microalbumin and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) levels. Histopathological studies revealed the preventive effect of TC on degenerative changes, mesangial proliferation and glomerular hypertrophy. Further, it reduced the inflammation and fibrotic changes in the kidney tissue estimated by various markers. The kidney tissue and gene expression analysis revealed the augmented levels of PPARγ after TC treatment. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, TC exerted the protective effect against DKD by inhibiting inflammation and fibrogenesis through the activation of PPARγ dependent pathways.",

Yet, to date, the application of Giloy has not been explored concerning oral cancer. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of T cordifolia (Thunb.) Miers (Giloy) extract (TcE) on an oral cancer cell line. METHODS: AW13516 (oral cancer cell line) cells were treated with the prepared aqueous extract of TcE for 24 h at various concentrations ranging between 5 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml and compared with control (cells without treatment). Thee effect of the extracts on apoptosis was assessed by through Annexin V flow cytometry assay and Luminometry based assessment of Caspase 8, 9 and caspase 3/7 activity. RNA was isolated from treated cells and gene expression of selected metastatic genes (MMP1, MMP10, and CXCL8); epithelial-mesenchymal stem cell genes (TWIST1, SNAIL, ZEB1, Oct4) and stemness related genses (Nanog, Sox2) were analyzed by using a quantitative real-time PCR system. The experiments were performed in triplicates. RESULTS: Aqueous extract of TcE was found to induce apoptosis inducer in AW13516 cells in a concentration-dependent manner and was potent even at a low concentration of 5 μg/ml. The apoptosis induction was confirmed with the caspase activity assay. Treatment of the cells with the extract for 24 h exhibited a significant decrease in the expression of EMT genes in a dose-dependent manner without an effect on the metastatic genes. CONCLUSION: Aqueous extract of TcE induces apoptosis-mediated cell death in the oral cancer cell line AW13516 while attenuating its potential for epithelial mesenchymal transition."

      "abstract": "Buffaloes contribute about 49% of total milk production and are considered as major milk-producing animals in India. During the early stage of lactation, mostly high producing animals suffer from negative energy balance (NEB) due to imbalance between the needs and availability of energy, and this NEB has a negative impact on production and health of buffaloes. Taking this into consideration, a study was conducted at National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal on 20 freshly calved healthy Murrah buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). Buffaloes were grouped depending on their previous milk yield, body weight, and parity as T0 (control), T1 (fatty acids), T2 (Tinospora), and T3 (mix) groups having five animals each. Supplementation of 150 g of bypass fatty acids in T1 group, 150 g of Tinospora powder in T2 group, and combination of 150 of bypass fatty acid and 150 g of Tinospora powder in T3 group over and above the standard feeding schedule was done for a duration of 90 days whereas standard feeding schedule was followed in T0 group. A significant (P < 0.05) increase in average daily milk yield was observed in T1 (10.06 ± 0.56 kg/d/h), T2 (10.30 ± 0.53 kg/d/h), and T3 (10.11 ± 0.48 kg/d/h) in comparison to control group (8.05 ± 0.38 kg/d/h). Significantly (P < 0.05) higher milk fat percent and total solids were also recorded in treatment groups over the control group. Other milk constituents (SNF, protein, lactose, ash) and milk properties (pH, conductivity, freezing point, density) remained unaffected by the supplementations. The somatic cell count values were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in T2 and T3 with the advancement in the lactation in comparison to T0 and T1. Supplementation also leads to significantly (P < 0.05) higher MUFA and PUFA contents in milk of treatment group buffaloes in comparison to control group. The study outcomes state that combination of bypass fatty acids and Tinospora cordifolia supplementation improves milk production and its composition in lactating Murrah buffaloes.",

Further, as no effective management protocols to address this pandemic were available, a need was felt to explore the integration of modern and traditional medicines to treat COVID- 19 cases. OBJECTIVE: To undertake a study with Ayurveda formulation as add on to existing standard of care (SOC) and to compare the outcomes in terms of patient acceptability, the time to clinical recovery, hospital stay as well as any signs of drug-herb interaction between the Ayurveda formulation and the SOC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An exploratory nonrandomized prospective study has been undertaken for comparing the outcomes of traditional Ayurvedic classical formulation of Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Piper longum (Pippali) as an add on to standard of care (SOC) using modern medicine with SOC alone. This has been done in mild and moderate COVID- 19 cases, at a tertiary care integrative Medicine hospital in the National Capital Region, Gurgaon, India. The outcomes have been evaluated in terms of the duration of hospital stay, the time to clinical recovery, safety and non- interference/interaction of Ayurvedic and Further, long term impact of COVID- 19 treatment has been evaluated using quality of life questionnaire after 3 months of discharge. RESULTS: Findings of present study reveals that the Ayurveda add-on formulation of T. cordifolia (Guduchi) and P. longum (Pippali) has reduced the length of hospital stay and improve the recovery time. General feeling of wellbeing and activity levels were better in the 3 month follow-up post discharge in the Ayurveda add-on group. CONCLUSION: Addition of Ayurveda formulation has reduced the time of recovery and duration of hospital stay. However, this formulation needs further investigated to provide more information on effective and safe herbal add-on to SOC for better outcomes to treatment of COVID-19 disease."

      "abstract": "Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia [Willd.] Miers) is a flagship rejuvenating herb of Ayurveda with reported anti-diabetic potential. In the present study, different dosage forms of Guduchi stem (growing on neem tree) were developed by adopting Ayurvedic pharmaceutical process of Bhavana (levigation). Guduchi Churna (GC) was subjected to 07 times Bhavana separately with its own extracted juice, decoction and potable water, and dosage forms namely Svarasa Bhavita Guduchi Churna (SBGC), Kwatha Bhavita Guduchi Churna (KBGC), and Jala Bhavita Guduchi Churna (JBGC) were prepared. The present study was aimed to evaluate the role of Bhavana on the potentiation of therapeutic properties of Guduchi. Sequential solvent extracts (5, 10, 15 and 25%) of GC, SBGC, KBGC and JBGC were prepared in different solvents [phosphate buffer, hexane, dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform] and screened for the α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The results revealed that phosphate buffer and DCM extracts of SBGC exhibited strong α-amylase inhibitory potential (>80% inhibition at 25% concentration) followed by KBGC, JBGC and GC with reference to the standard acarbose. In α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, maximum inhibition was observed in DCM and chloroform extracts of SBGC (>85% inhibition at 25% concentration), followed by KBGC (>80% inhibition at 25% concentration), JBGC and GC. In vivo anti-hyperglycemic studies were carried out by oral glucose tolerance test in Swiss albino mice. Test drugs (JBGC, KBGC, SBGC) treated groups showed marginal decrease of blood glucose levels in normo glycemic mice. However, the blood glucose level in test drug JBGC, KBGC and SBGC treated groups was still within normal range in overnight fasted mice. In oral glucose tolerance test, among all dosage forms SBGC (51.08%) produced pronounced anti-hyperglycemic effect followed by KBGC (42.57%) at a dose of 520 mg/kg. The GC, JBGC, KBGC and SBGC samples were also standardized using berberine (a well established anti-diabetic compound) as a marker compound by HPTLC fingerprint analysis. Findings of the present study indicate that SBGC and KBGC can be used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and gives supporting evidence to Ayurvedic claims that the Bhavana process has pharmaceutico-therapeutic significance in Ayurvedic drug development."

Alternate therapies aimed at symptomatic relief are currently prescribed along with artificial ventilation to relieve distress. Traditional medicine in the form of Ayurveda has been used since ancient times as a holistic treatment option rather than targeted therapy. The practice of Ayurveda has several potent herbal alternatives for chronic cough, inflammation, and respiratory distress which are often seen in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we have used the aqueous extracts of Tinospora cordifolia (willd.) Hook. f. and Thomson in the form of Giloy Ghanvati, as a means of treatment to the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein induced disease phenotype in a humanized zebrafish model. The introduction of spike-protein in the swim bladder transplanted with human lung epithelial cells (A549), caused an infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells such as granulocytes and macrophages into the swim bladder. There was also an increased systemic damage as exemplified by renal tissue damage and increased behavioral fever in the disease induction group. These features were reversed in the treatment group, fed with three different dosages of Giloy Ghanvati. The resultant changes in the disease phenotype were comparable to the group that were given the reference compound, Dexamethasone. These findings correlated well with various phyto-compounds detected in the Giloy Ghanvati and their reported roles in the viral disease phenotype amelioration."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tinospora cordifolia (Willd).Miers is a perennial climbing medicinal shrub that has been traditionally used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory ailments. Our previous pre- clinical studies on anti-inflammatory effects, proved that the chloroform extract of T. cordifolia (CETC) suppressed the LPS induced up-regulation of pro-inflammatory biomarkers, hence, further follow up study was carried out to evaluate whether CETC can exhibit a protective effect against LPS induced lethal endotoxemia in vivo and also to analyze the impact of CETC pre-treatment on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro by THP-1 cells. METHODS: To corroborate our previous preclinical studies on inflammation, we investigated the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of T. cordifolia on THP-cells which were pre-incubated with CETC (30 min) and stimulated subsequently with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 20 h. Levels as well as gene expressions of various cytokines were compared with that of LPS alone incubated cells. Alongside, in vivo oral anti-inflammatory efficacy against LPS induced endotoxemia study was effectuated, wherein rats were administered with CETC 48, 24, 12 and 1 h prior to the injection of LPS and the survival of rats were monitored upto 10 days. Cytokine levels were quantified by ELISA. Nitrite levels were measured using Griess reagent. Expression of pro-inflammatory proteins was inspected in rat tissues by histochemical and immuno -histochemical examinations. RESULTS: CETC was able to down-regulate the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory biomarkers in THP-1 macrophages though blockade of NF-κB nuclear translocation and could improve the survival rate during endotoxemic episodes with a marked suppression of the tissue expression of pro-inflammatory proteins. CONCLUSION: These findings concomitantly reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism of CETC and support us to move forward for the development of drugs against disorders resulting from deregulated immune reactions.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Hypertriglyceridemia (HG) is an independent risk factor with more prevalence than hypercholesterolemia and its attributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and pancreatitis. Hence, it becomes imperative to search for new triglyceride (TG) lowering agents. Tinospora cordifolia (TC) is a well-known Ayurvedic drug and a rich source of protoberberine alkaloids hence can contribute to TG lowering without side effects. Hence, to explore the therapeutic efficacy of T. cordifolia and its effects on biochemistry and metabolome in the patients of hyper-triglyceridemia, clinical trials were conducted. METHODS: Patients (n = 24) with hypertriglyceridemia were randomized into two groups to receive T. cordifolia extract (TCE) (3.0 g/per day) and metformin (850 mg/day) for 14 days having >300 mg/dl triglyceride level and cholesterol in the range of 130-230 mg/dl. Lipid profiles of blood samples were analyzed. Urine samples were subjected to HPLC-QTOF-MS to quantify oxidative damage and abnormal metabolic regulation. RESULTS: Intervention with TCE reduced the triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL levels to 380.45 ± 17.44, 133.25 ± 3.18, and 31.85 ± 5.88 mg/dL and increased the HDL to 47.50 ± 9.05 mg/dL significantly (p < 0.05) in the HG patients after 14 days treatment. TCE dosage potently suppressed the inflammatory and oxidative stress marker's i.e. levels of isoprostanes significantly (p < 0.01). Qualitative metabolomics approach i.e. PCA and PLS-DA showed significant alterations (p < 0.05) in the levels of 40 metabolites in the urine samples from different groups. CONCLUSION: TCE administration depleted the levels of markers of HG i.e. VLDL, TG, and LDL significantly. Metabolomics studies established that the anti-HG activity of TCE was due to its antioxidative potential and modulation of the biopterin, butanoate, amino acid, and vitamin metabolism.

      "abstract": "Traditionally, Tinospora cordifolia is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity; has been evaluated for their anti-diabetic and anti-obese potency in experimental animal models. However, the binding affinity of multiple bioactives with various proteins involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and obesity has not been reported yet. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the binding affinity of multiple bioactives from T. cordifolia with various targets involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and obesity. The ligands and targets were retrieved from the PubChem and Protein Data Bank respectively and docked using autodock4.0. Druglikeness and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile were predicted using Molsoft and admetSAR1 respectively. The multiple bioactives from T. cordifolia were identified to interact with multiple proteins involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes/obesity, i.e., isocolumbin (- 9 kcal/mol) with adiponectin (PDB: 4DOU), β-sitosterol (- 10.9 kcal/mol) with cholesteryl ester transfer protein (PDB: 2OBD), tinocordiside (- 6.9 kcal/mol) with lamin A/C (PDB: 3GEF), berberine (- 9.5 kcal/mol) with JNK1 (PDB:3ELJ), β-sitosterol & isocolumbin (- 10.1 kcal/mol) with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PDB:4CI5), berberine (- 7.5 kcal/mol) with suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (PDB: 2BBU), isocolumbin (- 9.6 kcal/mol) with pancreatic α-amylase (PDB: 1B2Y), isocolumbin (- 9 kcal/mol) with α-glucosidase (PDB: 3TOP), and β-sitosterol (- 10.8 kcal/mol) with aldose reductase (PDB: 3RX2). Similarly, among the selected bioactives, tembetarine scored highest druglikeness score, i.e., 1.21. In contrast, isocolumbin scored lowest drug-likeness character i.e. - 0.52. The predicted result of phytochemicals from T. cordifolia for acute oral toxicity, rat acute toxicity, fish toxicity, drug-likeness score, and aqueous solubility showed the probability of lower side/adverse effects in human consumption. The study suggests processing for bioactives from T. cordifolia against diabetes and obesity via in-vitro and in-vivo approaches."

It is associated with a range of co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cognitive dysfunctions. Therefore, the need for a safe and effective treatment has led to the exploration of natural products for the management of obesity. In the present study, we tested the anxiolytic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-neuroinflammatory potential of Tinospora cordifolia in a high fat diet-induced obesity rat model system. Young female Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups: (1) Low fat diet (LFD), fed on normal chow feed; (2) High fat diet (HFD), fed on diet containing 30% fat by weight; and (3) High fat diet containing extract (HFDE), fed on high fat diet supplemented with the stem powder of T. cordifolia (TCP). The rats from each group were kept on their respective feeding regimen for 12 weeks. The body weight and calorie intake were recorded weekly. The elevated plus maze test and rotarod performance test were performed to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior and locomotor coordination, respectively. The levels of serum cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) were estimated and various markers for inflammation, synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, and energy homeostasis were studied by western blotting. The HFDE rats showed reduced anxiety-like behavior and improved locomotor behavior as compared to HFD-induced obese rats. The TCP supplementation in high fat diet suppressed the expression of inflammatory molecules, including serum cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), and modulated apoptosis and synaptic plasticity. TCP was found to be effective in managing body weight in HFD-fed rats by maintaining energy metabolism and cellular homeostasis. T. cordifolia may be recommended as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent the adverse effects of obesity and obesity-associated brain dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to unveil the chemopreventive potentials of aqueous Tinospora cordifolia stem extract and its active component viz. Arabinogalactan against Benzo(a)pyrene-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis. Animals were divided into six groups: (I) Control, (II) aqueous Tinospora cordifolia (200 mg/kg b.wt, p.o.), (III) arabinogalactan (7.5 mg/kg b.wt, p.o.), (IV) benzo(a)pyrene (50 mg/kg b.wt, i.p.) at second and fourth week of study, (V) benzo(a)pyrene + aqueous Tinospora cordifolia, and (VI) benzo(a)pyrene + arabinogalactan. The benzo(a)pyrene treatment resulted in severe alterations in the cellular arrangement and morphology of the alveolar tissue in benzo(a)pyrene group. However, benzo(a)pyrene + aqueous Tinospora cordifolia and benzo(a)pyrene + arabinogalactan groups revealed classical features of apoptosis including chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Furthermore, Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy analysis showed disturbed phospholipid saturation and protein secondary structures in benzo(a)pyrene treated animals. Depletion in relative glycogen and enhancement in total nucleic acid content was observed in benzo(a)pyrene treated animals, and the same was found to be restored upon arabinogalactan and aqueous Tinospora cordifolia supplementation. Benzo(a)pyrene insult also upregulated the phase I carcinogen metabolizing enzymes and differentially modulated the phase II metabolizing enzymes during pulmonary carcinogenesis. Also, depleted (reduced glutathione) and increased lipid peroxidation levels were observed in benzo(a)pyrene treated animals, which was found to be normalized upon aqueous Tinospora cordifolia and arabinogalactan administration. Clastogenic damage inflicted by benzo(a)pyrene was also reversed in benzo(a)pyrene + aqueous Tinospora cordifolia and benzo(a)pyrene + arabinogalactan group. Thus, the present study infers that aqueous Tinospora cordifolia and arabinogalactan showed promising anticancer activity against lung tumorigenesis in terms of ultrastructural, biochemical, and biomolecular aspects.",

      "abstract": "Arsenic poisoning is one of the most serious health hazards of recent times. It has been estimated that more than 200 million people of about 105 countries in the world are affected due to arsenic poisoning. Except mitigation, there is no such mode by which the population can be prevented from being exposed to arsenic. Tinospora cordifolia (T. cordifolia) is widely used in the folk medicine system for the treatment of various diseases. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the antidote effects of ethanolic extract of T. cordifolia stem against arsenic induced hepato-renal toxicity in rat model. Twenty-four male Charles Foster rats (weighing 160-180 g) were randomly divided into two groups, where six rats were used as control group. Eighteen rats were orally treated with arsenic at the dose of 8 mg/kg body weight for 90 days daily and then further divided into three sub groups (n = 6 each). Sub group I-arsenic treated rats, were sacrificed after treatment; sub group II rats were used as arsenic control and the sub group III rats were administrated with T. cordifolia at the dose of 400 mg/kg body weight/day for 90 days. After the completion of dose duration, all the control and treatment group rats were sacrificed to evaluate the various parameters. Arsenic induced rats had significantly (p < 0.0001) altered biochemical serum levels of SGPT, SGOT, ALP, total bilirubin, urea, uric acid, creatinine and albumin; But, after the administration of T. cordifolia there was significant (p < 0.0001) restoration observed in these liver and kidney function parameters. The T. cordifolia administration also significantly (p < 0.0001) restored the serum MDA levels and arsenic concentration in blood, liver and kidney tissues, as well as significant (p < 0.0001) improvement in haematological variables. In histopathological study, the arsenic treated rats showed degenerative changes in the liver and kidney tissues such as lesions and vacuolizations in hepatocytes and nephrocytes respectively. However, after the administration with T. cordifolia rats, there was considerably significant restoration in liver and kidney tissues. The entire study suggests that arsenic caused severe damage to the liver and kidney at haematological, biochemical and histopathological levels in rats. However, T. cordifolia played the vital role to combat the arsenic induced toxicity in rats. Hence, T. cordifolia might be used as a nutritional supplement to combat the arsenic led toxicity among the exposed population.",

      "abstract": "The recent appearance of COVID-19 virus has created a global crisis due to unavailability of any vaccine or drug that can effectively and deterministically work against it. Naturally, different possibilities (including herbal medicines having known therapeutic significance) have been explored by the scientists. The systematic scientific study (beginning with in silico study) of herbal medicines in particular and any drug in general is now possible as the structural components (proteins) of COVID-19 are already characterized. The main protease of COVID-19 virus is Mpro or 3CLpro which is a key CoV enzyme and an attractive drug target as it plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription. In the present study, 3CLpro is used to study drug:3CLpro interactions and thus to investigate whether all or any of the main chemical constituents of Tinospora cordifolia (e.g. berberine (C20H18NO4), β-sitosterol (C29H50O), coline (C5H14NO), tetrahydropalmatine (C21H25NO4) and octacosanol (C28H58O)) can be used as an anti-viral drug against SARS-CoV-2. The in silico study performed using tools of network pharmacology, molecular docking including molecular dynamics have revealed that among all considered phytochemicals in Tinospora cordifolia, berberine can regulate 3CLpro protein's function due to its easy inhibition and thus can control viral replication. The selection of Tinospora cordifolia was motivated by the fact that the main constituents of it are known to be responsible for various antiviral activities and the treatment of jaundice, rheumatism, diabetes, etc.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Tinospora cordifolia, commonly known as Guduchi in India, is one of the most highly valued herbs in Ayurvedic medicine. It possesses potential anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anti-diabetic, immune-stimulatory and various other beneficial activities. PURPOSE: The present study was aimed to investigate the differentiation inducing potential of chloroform and hexane extracts of T. cordifolia using U87MG glioblastoma and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell lines as model system. RESULTS: Chloroform (Chl-TCE) and hexane (Hex-TCE) extracts significantly reduced the rate of proliferation and induced cell differentiation as evidenced by MTT assay and immunostaining for GFAP and MAP-2 in glioblastoma and neuroblastoma, respectively. Further these extracts increased the expression of stress markers HSP70 and Mortalin and induced senescence. Chloroform and hexane extracts also inhibited the migration of U87MG glioblastoma and IMR-32 neuroblastoma as indicated by wound scratch assay and supported by reduced expression of NCAM. Furthermore these extracts are not toxic to normal cells as they showed no inhibitory effects on primary astrocytic and neuronal cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that chloroform and hexane extracts of T. cordifolia retard the rate of proliferation, induce differentiation and inhibit migration of human glioblastomas and neuroblastomas, thus may act as potential phytotherapeutic intervention in treatment of neural cancers."

In silico analysis of the anticancer activity of TC + ZO was carried out using Cytoscape 3.2.0 software to elucidate the mechanism. The MTT assay confirms the combination of TC and ZO is more active (IC50; 2 μg ml-1) as compared to TC (509 μg ml-1) and ZO (1 mg ml-1) alone in MCF-7 cells. The TC + ZO combination treatment inhibits DNA synthesis, migration, and induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as compared to TC and ZO alone at a concentration of 1 µg ml-1. TC + ZO combination treatment arrested cell cycle significantly at the G0/G1 phase. The proposed synergistic activity of the two herbs in the treatment of several cancers was correlated with an appropriate associated target/s, based on the pharmacological network. Interestingly, when both the plants used in combination, were found to regulate a total of 16 genes in 27 types of cancers. Further, ALOX5, MMP2, and MMP9 genes were identified as major targets which are responsible for the TC + ZO anticancer activity. According to merged and sub-networks of source-bioactive, bioactive-target, target-disease of TC, ZO alone and their combination; MMP9 was selected for validation purpose. The real-time PCR analysis confirmed that the TC + ZO combination treatment significantly down-regulated MMP9 mRNA expression by fivefold via up-regulation of its downstream target ER-α by 3.5-fold. In conclusion, the network analysis and in vitro validation confirmed the potent synergistic activity of TC + ZO combination treatment in breast cancer."

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms behind the anticancer activity of BBR by comparing the effects of purified BBR with those of the extract of Tinospora cordifolia, a medicinal plant that produces this metabolite. The expression levels of a panel of 44 selected genes in human colon adenocarcinoma (HCA-7) cell line were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BBR treatment resulted in a time- and dose-dependent down regulation of 33 genes differently involved in cell cycle, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The trend was confirmed across the two types of treatment, the two time points, and the different absolute dosage of BBR. These findings suggest that the presence of BBR in T. cordifolia extract significantly contributes to its antiproliferative activity.",

Development of alternative therapeutic strategies effective against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity is much in demand. Herbal drug development is emerging as a major research area for the treatment of various debilitating diseases due to multimodal action and least side effects of herbal products. The current study was aimed to investigate neuroprotective potential of butanol extract of Tinospora cordifolia (B-TCE) against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity using primary hippocampal neurons as in vitro and Wistar strain albino rats as in vivo model systems. Molecular and behavioral parameters were studied to elucidate the underlying mechanism of beneficial effects of B-TCE. B-TCE treatment was also effective in prevention of anxiety, cognition, and motor-coordination deficits induced by glutamate. B-TCE pre-treatment protected the hippocampal neurons from glutamate-induced neurodegeneration and impaired plasticity. At molecular level, B-TCE was observed to attenuate overactivation of glutamate receptors. B-TCE promoted upregulation of ERK and AKT pathways of synaptic plasticity and cell survival in the hippocampus region of brain. This study provides first evidence of neuroprotective potential of B-TCE against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in hippocampus region and suggests that B-TCE may act as a potential candidate for neuroprotective therapeutic approaches. A single compound 'tinosporicide' was further isolated from B-TCE, which was found to be effective at 800× lower concentration against glutamate-induced neurodegeneration under in vitro conditions.",

Further, the birds surviving IBD become susceptible to secondary infections caused by various viral and bacterial agents. This study assessed the immunoprophylactic potential of Cytosine-guanosinedeoxynucleotide (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and Tinospora cordifolia stem aqueous extract in the specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks, experimentally infected with very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV). Both of these agents (CpG ODN and herbal extract) showed significant increase in the IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-1 levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (p < 0.05) of chickens in the treatment groups following IBD infection.Further we found significant reduction in mortality rate in vvIBDV infected chicks treated with either, or in combination, compared with the birds of control group. Additionally, the adjuvant or immune enhancing potential of these two immunomodulatory agents with the commercially available IBDV vaccine was determined in chicks. The augmentation of vaccine response in terms of an enhanced antibody titer after vaccination, along with either or a combination of the two agents was noticed. The findings provide a way forward to counter the menace of IBDV in the poultry sector through use of these herbal or synthetic immunomodulatory supplements."

However, the effects and mechanisms of TC on AI have not been studied yet. We conducted in vivo and in vitro studies to evaluate the effect of TC on AI. HPLC studies were also carried out to find out active constituents in TC extract. Model system exhibiting AI was developed by repeated injections of HKBA in Wistar rats. TC treated groups showed significantly higher levels of Hb and RBC count compared to the inflammatory control group. TC treatment showed reduction in the expression of the HAMP (hepcidin) gene in the rat liver. TC extract also inhibited gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) and decreased NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. The HPLC analysis revealed the presence of tinosporaside, which could have synergistically contributed to the above findings. Overall results indicate that TC therapy was able to maintain circulating iron through reduction of inflammatory cytokines and expression of hepcidin in rats.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of the aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia (AETC) against cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression and systemic Candida albicans infection in a murine model. METHODS: The protective effect of AETC against cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia was evaluated by quantitative and qualitative analysis of the leukocytes. The immune-stimulating potential of AETC on macrophages was assessed by determining the levels of secreted cytokines. To determine the direct antifungal activity, AETC or fluconazole was administered to C. albicans infected mice. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by determining the survival rate, kidney fungal burden, the organ index and liver inflammation parameters. RESULTS: Cyclophosphamide administration resulted in substantial depletion of leukocytes, whereas AETC treatment induced the recovery of leukocytes in cyclophosphamide-injected mice. Moreover, AETC treatment of macrophages resulted in enhanced secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1β. C. albicans infected mice treated with AETC at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg exhibited 40% and 60% survival rate, whereas the mice treated with fluconazole at a dose of 50 mg/kg showed 20% survival rate. Like survival data, the fungal load was found to be the lowest in the kidney tissues of mice treated with AETC at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Interestingly, mice infected with C. albicans demonstrated improvement in the organ indices and liver functioning after AETC treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that AETC may potentially be used to rejuvenate the weakened immune system and eliminate systemic candidiasis in mice.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative central nervous system disorder, is characterised by progressive loss of nigrostriatal neurons in basal ganglia. Previous studies regarding PD have suggested the role of oxidative stress along with neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration. Accordingly, our study explore the anti-inflammatory activity of Tinospora cordifolia aqueous extract (TCAE) in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra hydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated Parkinsonian mouse model. MPTP-intoxicated mice showed significant behavioral and biochemical abnormalities which were effectively reversed by TCAE. It is evident that TCAE inhibits the MPTP-intoxicated Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and its associated pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) from immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In MPTP-intoxicated mice, microglial and astroglial-specific inflammatory markers, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), respectively were increased while were significantly reduced in TCAE treatment. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, TNF-α, Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were found to be upregulated in MPTP-intoxicated mice, whereas TCAE treatment restored their levels. Additionally, anti-inflammatory factor Interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene was found to be downregulated in MPTP-intoxicated mice which were significantly restored by TCAE treatment. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression was reduced in MPTP-intoxicated mice, while its expression was significantly increased in TCAE-treated group. Our result strongly suggests that T. cordifolia protects dopaminergic neurons by suppressing neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced Parkinsonian mouse model.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of the natural compound, Bis(2- ethyl hexyl) 1H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarboxylate (TCCP), purified from Tinospora cordifolia on MDA-MB-231, a TNBC cell line. The pro-apoptotic nature of TCCP on MDA-MB-231 was determined by assessing various apoptotic markers. ROS generation, intracellular calcium, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), MPTP, cardiolipin peroxidation and caspase activity were determined fluorometrically. BAX, BCL-2, cytochrome c, caspases, and p53 protein expressions were determined by immunoblotting. Further, the effect of TCCP on DNA and cell death was determined by DNA fragmentation assay, annexin-V staining, and cell cycle analysis. TCCP treatment caused endogenous ROS generation, increase in intracellular calcium and phosphorylation of p53 in a concentration-dependent manner, which was reverted upon pre-treatment with pifithrin-μ. This led to the downstream altered expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, MPTP, and cardiolipin peroxidation. TCCP induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol, caspase activation, ultimately resulting in DNA fragmentation. Further, induction of apoptosis and morphological alterations were evident from the phosphatidylserine externalization and increase in sub G1 population. The in vivo Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) mouse study revealed the effectiveness of TCCP in reducing the tumor burden and resulted in a ~2 fold increase in mice survival with minimal hepato-renal toxicity. Overall, TCCP was shown to be efficient in inducing ROS and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by restoring p53 activity in MDA-MB-231 cells and also induced EAT cell death in vivo thereby inhibiting tumor proliferation.",

Macrophages being the primary host for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, offer an attractive target for modulation. Owing to their negligible toxicity, plant derived polysaccharides with the ability to activate macrophages; are suitable candidates for immunomodulation. In the present study, effects of polysaccharide rich extract (PRE) isolated from Tinospora cordifolia, on the survival of intracellular MTB strains and activation of macrophages were investigated. PRE treatment up regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ in RAW 264.7 cell line. Up regulation in the expression of NOS2 was observed along with concomitant enhanced nitric oxide production post PRE treatment. Surface expression of MHC-II and CD-86 was up regulated after PRE treatment. Above results suggested the classical activation of macrophages by PRE treatment. Furthermore, PRE treatment led to the activation of all the three classes of MAPK i.e p38, ERK and JNK MAPKs. Further, PRE up regulated the expression of cytokines, NOS-2, MHC-II and CD-86 in MTB infected macrophages. PRE treatment inhibited the intracellular survival of drug resistant MTB in macrophages which was partially attributed to PRE mediated NO induction. Thus our data demonstrate classical activation of macrophages by PRE treatment and killing of intracellular MTB by NO induction.",

The study investigates the protective effect of Tinospora cordifolia stem methanolic extract (TCME) on Cd induced hepatotoxicity. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of the study was to explore the hepatoprotective effects of T. cordifolia extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were administered orally with Cd (5 mg/kg) and TCME (100 mg/kg) for 28 days. At the end of the treatment period, serum and liver tissues homogenates were subjected to biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Cd treated rats showed increased activities of the serum marker enzymes of liver damage such as AST and ALT along with increased levels of LPO and protein carbonyl content in liver tissues. Cd treatment also leads to decreased activities of endogenous antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx and GST), membrane ATPases (Na+K+ATPase, Ca2+ATPase and Mg2+K+ATPase) and the tissue glycoprotein levels (hexose, fucose, hexosamine and sialic acid). Histological analysis revealed vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes with focal necrosis upon Cd administration. TCME co-treatment restored the biochemical and histological alterations caused by Cd intoxication to near normal levels. CONCLUSION: The results of the present investigation reveal the hepatoprotective nature of T.cordifolia against Cd induced hepatotoxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter of CNS acts as a neurotoxin at higher concentrations. Prolonged activation of glutamate receptors results in progressive neuronal damage by aggravating calcium influx, inducing mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress. Excitotoxic cell death is associated with the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders such as trauma, brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. The current study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative potential of Tinospora cordifolia against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity using primary cerebellar neuronal cultures as a model system. METHODS: Monosodium salt of glutamate was used to induce neurotoxic injury in primary cerebellar neurons. Four extracts including Hexane extract, Chloroform extract, Ethyl acetate, and Butanol extract were obtained from fractionation of previously reported aqueous ethanolic extract of T. cordifolia and tested for neuroprotective activity. Out of the four fractions, Butanol extract of T. cordifolia (B-TCE) exhibited neuroprotective potential by preventing degeneration of neurons induced by glutamate. Expression of different neuronal, apoptotic, inflammatory, cell cycle regulatory and plasticity markers was studied by immunostaining and Western blotting. Neurite outgrowth and migration were also studied using primary explant cultures, wound scratch and gelatin zymogram assay. RESULTS: At molecular level, B-TCE pretreatment of glutamate-treated cultures normalized the stress-induced downregulation in the expression of neuronal markers (MAP-2, GAP-43, NF200) and anti-apoptotic marker (Bcl-xL). Further, cells exposed to glutamate showed enhanced expression of inflammatory (NF-κB, AP-1) and senescence markers (HSP70, Mortalin) as well as the extent of mitochondrial damage. However, B-TCE pretreatment prevented this increase and inhibited glutamate-induced onset of inflammation, stress and mitochondrial membrane damage. Furthermore, B-TCE was observed to promote regeneration, migration and plasticity of cerebellar neurons, which was otherwise significantly inhibited by glutamate treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that B-TCE may have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative potential against catastrophic consequences of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and could be a potential therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative diseases.",

In the qualitative assay, Out of 19 fungal endophytes, 7 endophytes exhibited > 30% XO inhibition, of which isolates #1 TCSTITPLM, #53 TCSTITPLM, #105 TCSTITPLM and #83 TCSTITPLM were found to exhibit XO inhibition in the range of 38-45%. Further, ethyl acetate extract of #1TCSTITPLM exhibited 69% XO inhibitory activity followed by chloroform extract of #53 TCSTITPLM with 63% XOI activity in the in vitro uric acid estimation assay. In the quantitative NBT titer plate assay, both extracts exhibited 85% of XO inhibition. The present study is the first report of fungal endophytes isolated from T. cordifolia exhibiting XO inhibitory activity. Ethyl acetate and chloroform extract of #1 TCSTITPLM and #53 TCSTITPLM demonstrated potent XO inhibitory action.

However, studies regarding the mechanism of anti-inflammatory potential of this plant at the molecular level are lacking. METHODS: In vitro evaluations were conducted in RAW264.7 macrophages which were preincubated with chloroform extract of T. cordifolia (CETC) and subsequently stimulated with LPS. The expressions of COX-2, TNF-α and iNOS genes were analysed by SQRT-PCR and Western blot, cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and PGE2 ) levels by ELISA, NF-κB activation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation by Immunoblot and confocal imaging. Anti-inflammatory potential of CETC was validated further in a rat model of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema. Phytochemical characterisation was carried out using the HPLC technique. KEY FINDINGS: The LPS-induced upregulation of proinflammatory biomarkers was significantly prevented by CETC, without inhibiting COX-1. CETC- and LPS-incubated cells showed reduced phosphorylated p38 MAPK levels, and higher levels NF-κB were retained in cytoplasm. Rats pretreated with CETC showed a statistically significant decrease in paw oedema (P ≤ 0.05), and HPLC characterisation detected stigmasterol and β-sitosterol. The LD50 of CETC lies above 2000 mg/Kg body weight. CONCLUSIONS: These findings encourage us strongly to focus on CETC to develop anti-inflammatory drugs with lower degree of inhibition to the constitutively expressing COX-1.",

In vitro anti-Salmonella activity of T. cordifolia was determined through the broth dilution and agar well diffusion assays. The immune-stimulating potential of AETC or METC was determined by measuring the cytokine levels in the culture supernatants of treated murine J774 macrophages. Antibacterial activity of AETC or METC was determined by treating S. typhimurium-infected macrophages and BALB/C mice. The toxicity of AETC or METC was determined by measuring the levels of liver inflammation markers aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) and antioxidant enzymes. Macrophages treated with AETC or METC secreted greater levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β. METC showed greater activity against S. typhimurium infection in macrophages and mice as well. Treatment with METC resulted in increased survival and reduced bacterial load in S. typhimurium-infected mice. Moreover, METC or AETC treatment reduced the liver inflammation and rescued the levels of antioxidant enzymes in S. typhimurium-infected mice. The results of the present study suggest that the use of T. cordifolia may act as a double-edged sword in combating salmonellosis.",

The biosorption capacity was found to be 38.91 mg Cd/g and 43.06 mg Cd/g, in batch and column mode experiments, respectively. The work included uptake capacity, an equilibrium study, and a column study at varying pH (1-9), contact time (5-240 min), biosorbent dosages (1-8 g), and initial metal concentration (10-1000 mg/L). Both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were applied to study the dose-response behavior, and it was observed that the Freundlich model provided the highest R2 value. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated the involvement of hydroxyl, alkane, anhydride, halide, and amine functional groups. Multilayer adsorption as indicated by the Freundlich adsorption model, and multifunctional group interaction as identified in the FTIR analysis, explains the high adsorptive capacity. The biomass was successfully applied for the removal of cadmium from industrial effluents. Biosorbent also gave a higher removal percentage at a low pH value (pH 2). The feasibility and viability of the biomass for technocommercial utilization in effluent treatment appears high.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tinospora cordifolia is a miraculous ayurvedic herb used in the treatment of innumerable diseases such as diabetes, gonorrhea, secondary syphilis, anaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatological diseases, cancer, gout, jaundice, asthma, leprosy, in the treatment of bone fractures, liver & intestinal disorders, purifies the blood, gives new life to the whole body; (rejuvenating herb) and many more. Recent studies have revealed the anticancer potential of this plant but not much work has been done on the anticancer chemical constituents actually responsible for its amazing anticancer effects. This prompted us to investigate this plant further for new potent anticancer molecules. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to isolate and identify new promising anticancer candidates from the aqueous alcoholic extract of T. cordifolia using bioassay-guided fractionation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The structures of the isolated compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation and that of new potent anticancer molecule, TC-2 was confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis of its corresponding acetate. The in vitro anti-cancer activity of TC-2 was evaluated by SRB assay and the autophagic activity was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Annexin-V FITC and PI dual staining was applied for the detection of apoptosis. The studies on Mitochondrial Membrane potential and ROS (Reactive oxygen species) production were also done. RESULTS: Bioassay guided fractionation and purification of the aqueous alcoholic stem extract of Tinospora cordifolia led to the isolation of a new clerodane furano diterpene glycoside (TC-2) along with five known compounds i.e. cordifolioside A (β-D-Glucopyranoside,4-(3-hydroxy-1-propenyl)- 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl 3-O-D-apio-β-D-furanosyl) (TC-1), β-Sitosterol(TC-3), 2β,3β:15,16-Diepoxy- 4α, 6β-dihydroxy-13(16),14-clerodadiene-17,12:18,1-diolide (TC-4), ecdysterone(TC-5) and tinosporoside(TC-6). TC-2 emerged as a potential candidate for the treatment of colon cancer. CONCLUSION: The overall study on the bioassay guided isolation of T.cordifolia identified and isolated a new clerodane furano diterpenoid that exhibited anticancer activity via induction of mitochondria mediated apoptosis and autophagy in HCT116 cells. We have reported a promising future candidate for treating colon cancer.",

Many plant derived polysaccharides are known to activate macrophages. In the present study, effects of G1-4A, a polysaccharide derived from Tinospora cordifolia, on the activation of macrophages were investigated. Our data demonstrated the up regulation of expression of TNF-α, IL-β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-10 and IFN-γ in RAW 264.7 cell line and peritoneal macrophages after G-14A treatment. Nitric oxide levels were also enhanced along with up-regulation of NOS2 expression in murine macrophages post G1-4A treatment. Further, G1-4A treatment up-regulated the surface expression of MHC-II and CD-86 in macrophages. Using siRNA against TLR4, MyD88 and anti-TLR4 blocking antibodies, we established that G1-4A activated macrophages by classical pathway in TLR4-MyD88 dependent manner. Additionally, G1-4A treatment activated p38, ERK and JNK MAPKs in macrophages. Using pharmaceutical inhibitors of above MAPKs we concluded that G1-4A activates the macrophages by activation of p38, ERK and JNK MAPKs in RAW264.7 macrophages. Thus our data suggests the activation of macrophages by classical pathway after treatment of G1-4A.",

Macrophages are in a quiescent form and get activated when given a stimulus. In our previous studies we have reported that guduchi or LPS treatment of macrophages enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO) and increased tumoricidal activity against L929 fibroblast cells. OBJECTIVE: In the present study effect of Tinospora cordifolia commonly known as guduchi on macrophage activation and the mechanism of action i.e. involvement of protein kinase C inhibitor and tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitor was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was undertaken to determine whether H-7 (inhibitor of protein kinase C) and/or genistein (inhibitor of tyrosine-specific protein kinase) could inhibit guduchi or LPS-induced macrophage NO and TNF-α production or reduce the cytolysis of L929 fibroblast cells. RESULTS: It was observed that in vitro incubation with H-7 and/or genistein completely inhibited guduchi or LPS-induced NO and TNF-α production by macrophages (J774A.1). CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effects of H-7 and/or genistein, suggest that phosphorylation via these kinases may upregulate the NO synthase activity in macrophages."

The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of alcoholic extract of Tinospora cordifolia on bone remodeling (involving osteoblastic and osteoclastic actions) in vitro and protect against ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo. Human osteoblast-like cells MG-63 and primary osteoblast cells isolated from rat femur were used as osteoblast models and RAW macrophage cell line 264.7 induced to take up osteoclastic lineage using RANK ligand were used as osteoclast models in the current study. Sirius red staining, quantification of osteocalcin, cytopathological analysis by Hematoxylin/eosin staining and semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out to ascertain the effects of T. cordifolia extract on osteoblast cells. MTT assay was perfomed to understand the influence of T. cordifolia extract on osteoclast cells. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used as in vivo models to study the effect of T. cordifolia on ovariectomy induced bone loss. Radiological (DEXA analysis), Biochemical (markers of bone formation and resorption), histopathological (Hematoxylin/eosin staining) and histomorphometric analysis of the bone was carried out. Treatment with T. cordifolia extract resulted in enhanced collagen deposition, increased levels of osteocalcin, increased expression of osteogenic genes all indicative of favourable osteoblastogenesis. Treatment with T. cordifolia extract did not exert any significant influence on the proliferation of osteoclasts. Pretreatment with T. cordifolia extract at a dose of 50mg/kg body wt/day orally for 21days followed by treatment for 12 weeks post ovariectomy was able to prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo. Results of the study support the use of T. cordifolia in Indian ethnomedicine for the treatment of bone diseases and fractures.",

Tinospora cordifolia is a medicinal herb used in Ayurveda for treating various metabolic disorders and toxic conditions. The present study investigates the protective effect of T. cordifolia stem methanolic extract (TCME) on a heavy metal, Cd-induced cardiotoxicity in male Wistar rats. Male albino Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n=6). The animals after treatment for 28days with Cd and TCME were analysed for biochemical and histological changes in the serum and heart tissues. Cd induced lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation was significantly reduced by TCME. TCME also reduced the histological alterations induced by Cd treatment in the heart tissues with diminished loss of myocardial fibers. Administration of TCME effectively prevented the altered levels of serum marker enzymes (creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase), antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, and glycoproteins contents such as hexose, hexoseamine, fucose, and sialic acid by Cd intoxication. TCME also offered protection against the change in levels of Na+K+ATPase, Mg2+ATPase and Ca2+ATPase activities against Cd toxicity. The study suggests TCME as a potent cardioprotective agent against Cd induced toxicity.",

We found that TcCF inhibited growth of breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. More interestingly, we observed TcCF treatment increased intra-cellular ROS levels, altered expression of pro and anti-apoptotic genes, decreased colony formation ability and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We also found that inhibition of ROS abrogated TcCF induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells, emphasizing the role ROS in TcCF induced breast cancer cell death. Furthermore, we identified the presence of pharmacologically active compounds like rutin and quercetin which account for the anti-cancer property of TcCF against breast cancer cells.

GO enrichment analysis showed that GS targets various pathways including dopamine metabolism, cAMP-dependent signaling pathway, and glycolytic process. Biological processes obtained via PIN were correlated with hyperlipidemia markers and dopamine metabolism in moderate alcohol consumers (n=25) and healthy volunteers (n=27) of age 41±3.8years. Metabolic analysis demonstrated the increased serotonin (1.9-fold) and decreased dopamine (-2.3-fold) levels in alcoholics. Further data analysis revealed a significant increase in urinary BCAAs (>2.0-fold), pantothenic acid (1.8-fold), carnitines (>2-fold) levels, and decrease in PPARα activation markers levels i.e. nicotinamide-1-oxide (-1.7-fold), and N-methylnicotinamide (-1.6-fold) in alcoholics. Biochemical analysis showed the increased AST/ALT ratio (1.91), along with triglycerides (20%), and MDA (34%) and GSH (56%) levels in alcoholics. GS treatment significantly reverted the most of the discussed metabolites levels (p<0.05) and enzymes activities (p<0.05) in alcoholics. The data depict that moderate chronic alcohol consumption lead to hyperlipidemia and oxidative burden; whereas GS treatment ameliorates hyperlipidemia by decreasing oxidative stress, activating PPARα, CREB and SREBP-1 through stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors mediated signalling molecules i.e. cAMP and protein kinase A.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tinospora cordifolia is used for treatment of several diseases in Indian system of medicine. In the present study, the inhibition potential of T. cordifolia extracts and its constituent tinosporaside to cause herb-drug interactions through rat and human liver cytochrome enzymes was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioactive compound was quantified through reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography, to standardize the plant extracts and interaction potential of standardized extract. Interaction potential of the test sample was evaluated through cytochrome P450-carbon monoxide complex (CYP450-CO) assay with pooled rat liver microsome. Influence on individual recombinant human liver microsomes such as CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2 isozymes was analyzed through fluorescence microplate assay, and respective IC50 values were determined. RESULTS: The content of tinosporaside was found to be 1.64% (w/w) in T. cordifolia extract. Concentration-dependent inhibition was observed through T. cordifolia extract. Observed IC50 (μg/ml) value was 136.45 (CYP3A4), 144.37 (CYP2D6), 127.55 (CYP2C9), and 141.82 (CYP1A2). Tinosporaside and extract showed higher IC50 (μg/ml) value than the known inhibitors. T. cordifolia extract showed significantly less interaction potential and indicates that the selected plant has not significant herb-drug interactions relating to the inhibition of major CYP450 isozymes. CONCLUSIONS: Plant extract showed significantly higher IC50 value than respective positive inhibitors against CYP3A4, 2D6, 2C9, and 1A2 isozymes. Consumption of T. cordifolia may not cause any adverse effects when consumed along with other xenobiotics.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tinospora cordifolia (Willd. Hook. f. & Thomson; family: Menispermaceae), has a long history of use in various traditional medicinal systems including \"Ayurveda\". It is reported to possess anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antispasmodic, and antiinflammatory activities. T. cordifolia has also been well documented for production of various bioactive metabolites and their antioxidant activity, but the microorganisms associated with it have been least explored for the same properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: Aim of the present study was to evaluate antioxidant and in vivo genoprotective potential of phenolic compounds produced by an endophytic fungus Cladosporium velox TN-9S isolated from T. cordifolia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isolate of C. velox TN-9S was cultivated in malt extract medium and extracted with ethyl acetate. Total phenol content was determined by Folin Ciocalteu reagent. The antioxidant activity was measured in terms of DPPH and FRAP assay. The in vivo genoprotective activity was assessed using fish Channa punctatus as model. Identification of phenolic compounds was carried out using RP-HPLC. The fungal extract was evaluated for biosafety using Salmonella typhimurium His- strain and CHO cell lines for mutagenicity and cytotoxicity, respectively. RESULTS: The total phenolic content in the ethyl acetate extract of the fungus was determined to be 730μg gallic acid equivalent/mL. The extract evinced significant antioxidant activity with IC50 value of 22.5µg/mL in DPPH scavenging assay. The phenolic extract showed good in vivo genoprotective activity against the genetic damage induced in fish C. punctatus after treatment with a non-ionic surfactant 4-nonylphenol. RP-HPLC analysis revealed the presence of peaks corresponding to various phenolic compounds in the extract. Mutagenicity and cytotoxicity results revealed the extract to be nonmutagenic and non cytotoxic in nature. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the potential of an endophytic C. velox isolated from T. cordifolia as a producer of phenolic compounds with antioxidant and genoprotective activities which could be exploited in pharmaceutical industry. The ability of endophytes to produce similar compounds as the host, is also revealed in the present study.",

In the present study, we sought to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of G1-4A, a polysaccharide derived from the Indian medicinal plant Tinospora cordifolia, in in-vitro and aerosol mouse models of MTB infection. G1-4A treatment of MTB infected RAW264.7 macrophages significantly induced the surface expression of MHC-II and CD-86 molecules, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-β, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ) and nitric oxide leading to reduced intracellular survival of both drug sensitive (H37Rv) as well as multi drug resistant strains (Beijing and LAM) of MTB, which was partially attributed to G1-4A induced NO production in TLR4-MyD88 dependent manner. Similarly, bacillary burden was significantly reduced in the lungs of MTB infected BALB/c mice treated with G1-4A, with simultaneous up-regulation of the expression of TNF-α, INF-γ and NOS2 in the mouse lung along with increased levels of Th1 cytokines like IFN-γ, IL-12 and decreased levels of Th2 cytokine like IL-4 in the serum. Furthermore, combination of G1-4A with Isoniazid (INH) exhibited better protection against MTB compared to that due to INH or G1-4A alone, suggesting its potential as adjunct therapy. Our results demonstrate that modulation of host immune responses by G1-4A might improve the therapeutic efficacy of existing anti-tubercular drugs and provide an attractive strategy for the development of alternative therapies to control tuberculosis.",

However, studies doubt the relationship between moderate alcohol intake and sex hormone levels. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to establish the direct impact of chronic and moderate alcohol intake on cholesterol homeostasis and steroid hormone synthesis. Asymptomatic chronic and moderate alcoholics (n=12) without chronic liver disease and healthy volunteers (n=14) were selected for the study. Furthermore, effects of standardized water extract of Tinospora cordifolia (Willd) Mier. (Menispermaceae) (TCJ), a well reported anti-alcoholic herbal drug, on urinary steroids was studied. This study included four groups, i.e. a) healthy; b) healthy+TCJ; c) alcoholic; d) alcoholic+TCJ. The blood and urine samples from each group were collected on day 0 and 14 of the post-treatment with TCJ and analyzed. Alcoholic blood samples showed the significantly higher values of traditional biomarkers γ-GT and MCV along with cholesterol, LDL, TGL and urinary methylglucuronide compared to healthy. Qualitative analysis of steroids showed that moderate alcohol intake in a chronic manner increased the cholesterol synthesis and directed its flow toward C-21 steroids; shown by increased levels of corticosterone (2.456 fold) and cortisol (3.7 fold). Moreover, alcohol intake also increased the synthesis of estradiol and clearance rate of other steroids through the formation of glucuronides. Therefore, it decreased the synthesis and increased the clearance rate of testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A). Quantitative analysis confirmed decreased T/A ratio from 2.31 to 1.59 in plasma and 2.47 to 1.51 in urine samples of alcoholics. TCJ intervention normalized the levels of steroids and significantly improved the T:A ratio to 2.0 and 2.12 in plasma and urine. The study revealed that TCJ modulated lipid metabolism by inhibiting cholesterol and glucuronides synthesis.",

Tinospora cordifolia, a medicinal plant rich in phytochemicals, possesses antioxidant activity. The objective of the present study was to assess the protective effect of Tinospora cordifolia-stem methanolic extract (TCE) on Cd-induced nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were administered ∼5 mg/kg body weight Cd orally and 100 mg/kg body weight TCE for 28 days. At the end of Cd and TCE treatment, biochemical assays were performed in serum and tissue homogenate. RESULTS: Cd-induced oxidative stress in the kidney resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content with a significant decrease in cellular antioxidants, such as reduced GSH, SOD, CAT, GPX, and GST. Cd-induced nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by marked changes in the histology of the kidney and increased levels of kidney markers. Additionally, Cd-treated rats showed alterations in membrane-bound ATPase activity and decreased levels of tissue glycoproteins. Cotreatment with TCE considerably reduced the biochemical alterations in serum and renal tissue induced by Cd, and also restored ATPase activity and glycoproteins to near normal levels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that TCE with its antioxidant effect offered cytoprotection against Cd-induced toxicity in kidneys by restoring the altered cellular antioxidants and renal markers. TCE treatment for 28 days reversed ATPase activity and tissue glycoprotein levels. These results revealed the protective effect of TCE on Cd-induced toxicity in kidneys and oxidative stress."

OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to validate the traditional uses of T. cordifolia in treating pain, inflammation and pyrexia, using albino mice as an experimental animal model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analgesic effects of T. cordifolia extract were assessed by using the acetic acid-induced writhing test, hot plate test and tail-flick test. The carrageenan test was performed to assess anti-inflammatory potential, and anti-pyretic activity was evaluated by the brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia method. RESULTS: The results showed that the T. cordifolia extract exhibited significant analgesic effects in a dose-dependent manner in the three pain models tested. The extract also exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in the carrageenan-induced inflammation test and antipyretic effects in the brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia test in dose-dependent manner compared to the effects observed in the control group animals. CONCLUSIONS: From the findings of the present study, it can be concluded that T. cordifolia extract has strong analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects. Further studies are required to investigate the therapeutic activities of the phytochemical constituents of T. cordifolia against pain, inflammation and pyrexia.",

Tinospora cordifolia (T. cordifolia) is a widely used herbal source to treat various human ailments, including diabetes mellitus. The present study was aimed on evaluating the antidiabetic property of a novel polysaccharide isolated from the methanolic extract of T. cordifolia stem. Bioassay guided fractionation was followed to isolate a compound from the methanol extract. The compound was administered orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg.b.wt for 60 days to control and STZ-induced diabetic male Wistar rats. It was found that plasma glucose was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared to normal. Oral administration of the compound significantly decreased HBA1c, triglycerides and total cholesterol and at the same time markedly increased hemoglobin, tissue glycogen and HDL cholesterol. Also the compounds restored the altered carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, insulin, C-peptide, (14)C-glucose oxidation levels to near normal. In addition, the histological studies revealed that there was regeneration of β-cells in the pancreatic sections. The expression of Glut-4 mRNA and protein in the gasrtocnemius muscle were significantly enhanced after the compound treatment. These results confirm that the novel polysaccharide possesses hypoglycemic, glucose oxidizing, hypolipidemic and β-cell regenerative properties and hence it could be developed into potential oral hypoglycemic drug with lesser side effects.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Heavy alcohol intake depletes the plasma vitamins due to hepatotoxicity and decreased intestinal absorption. However, moderate alcohol intake is often thought to be healthy. Therefore, effects of chronic moderate alcohol intake on liver and intestine were studied using urinary vitamin levels. Furthermore, effects of Tinospora cordifolia water extract (TCE) (hepatoprotective) on vitamin excretion and intestinal absorption were also studied. METHODS: In the study, asymptomatic moderate alcoholics (n = 12) without chronic liver disease and healthy volunteers (n = 14) of mean age 39 ± 2.2 (mean ± SD) were selected and divided into three groups. TCE treatment was performed for 14 days. The blood and urine samples were collected on Day 0 and 14 after treatment with TCE and analyzed. RESULTS: In alcoholics samples, a significant increase in the levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, HDL and LDL (P < 0.05) was observed but their level get downregulated after TCE intervention. Multivariate analysis of metabolites without missing values showed an increased excretion of 7-dehydrocholesterol, orotic acid, pyridoxine, lipoamide and niacin and TCE intervention depleted their levels (P < 0.05). In contrast, excretion of biotin, xanthine, vitamin D2 and 2-O-p-coumaroyltartronic acid (CA, an internal marker of intestinal absorption) were observed to be decreased in alcoholic samples; however, TCE intervention restored the CA and biotin levels. Vitamin metabolism biomarkers, i.e. homocysteine and xanthurenic acid, were also normalized after TCE intervention. CONCLUSION: Overall data depict that moderate alcohol intake is also hepatotoxic and decreases intestinal absorption. However, TCE treatment effectively increased the intestinal absorption and retaining power of liver that regulated alcohol-induced multivitamin deficiency.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints leading to tissue damage. Despite the availability of potent drugs including the biologics, many patients fail to respond to them, whereas others suffer adverse effects following long-term use of these drugs. Accordingly, the use of natural herbal products by RA patients has been increasing over the years. However, limited information about the mechanism of action of these natural products is a major shortcoming that prevents the widespread acceptance of herbal therapy by professionals and patients alike. In this study, we demonstrated the anti-arthritic activity of Tinospora cordifolia extract (TCE) using the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model of human RA and elaborated the immune mechanisms underlying this effect. TCE treatment suppressed arthritic inflammation and bone and cartilage damage. The anti-inflammatory effect of TCE was mediated via reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as: IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17; the frequency of IL-17-producing T cells; and the production of chemokines such as RANTES. Furthermore, TCE treatment limited bone damage by shifting the balance of mediators of bone remodeling (e.g., receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand [RANKL] and MMP-9) in favor of anti-osteoclastic activity. Our results suggest that TCE and its bioactive components should be evaluated for their utility as therapeutic adjuncts to conventional drugs against RA.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers ex Hook. f. & Thomas. (Menispermaceae) is one of the most widely used plants in various traditional medicinal systems including \"Ayurveda\". The plant is used for the treatment of jaundice, rheumatism, urinary disorder, skin diseases, diabetes and anemia. The phytoconstituents present in the plant belongs to different class of compounds such as alkaloids, diterpenoids lactones, glycosides, steroids, phenol, aliphatic compounds and polysaccharides. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of present study was the isolation, structure elucidation, quantification and pharmacological evaluation of secondary metabolites from T. cordifolia for anticancer and immunomodulatory activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different extracts and fractions were prepared from the stem of T. cordifolia. Pure molecules were isolated using normal phase chromatography and characterized on the basis of NMR and mass spectroscopic techniques. The anti-cancer and immunomodulatory activities of different extracts, fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated against four different human cancer cell lines, KB (human oral squamous carcinoma), CHOK-1 (hamster ovary), HT-29 (human colon cancer) and SiHa (human cervical cancer) and murine primary cells respectively. A simple, normal phase HPTLC method was also developed for the quantification of three bioactive compounds i.e N-formylannonain (1), 11-hydroxymustakone (5) and yangambin (8) in the stem of T. cordifolia hosted on fifteen different plants. RESULTS: Chromatographic purification of different fractions led to the isolation of eight pure molecules i.e N-formylannonain (1), magnoflorine (2), jatrorrhizine (3) palmatine (4), 11-hydroxymustakone (5), cordifolioside A (6), tinocordiside (7) and yangambin (8). All extracts and fractions were active against KB and CHOK-1 cells whereas among the pure molecules palmatine (4) was found to be active against KB and HT-29; tinocordiside (7) against KB and CHOK-1; yangambin (8) against KB cells however N-formylannonain (1) and 11-hydroxymustakone (5), was found active for immunomodulatory activity. HPTLC quantification of three active molecules i.e N-formylannonain (1), 11-hydroxymustakone (5), and yangambin (8) were found in highest quantity in the stem of T. cordifolia hosted on Mangifera indica, however, other two active molecules were not quantified due to their insufficient quantity. CONCLUSION: Eight compounds have been isolated and characterized belonging to different classes. The pharmacological evaluation of extract, fractions and pure molecules revealed the ethnomedicinal value of T. cordifolia for anticancer and immunomodulatory activities.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: We have studied urine metabolic signature of chronic alcoholism (CA) before and after treatment with an Ayurvedic drug Tinospora cordifolia aqueous extract (TCE). METHODS: Urinary metabolites of chronic alcoholics and apparently healthy subjects were profiled using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Discrimination models from the initial data sets were able to correctly assign the unknown samples to the CA, treated or healthy groups in validation sets with r(2) > 0.98. RESULTS: Metabolic signature in CA patients include changed tryptophan, fatty acids and pyrimidines metabolism. Several novel biomarkers of alcoholism were observed in urine for the first time which includes, 5-hydroxyindole, phenylacetic acid, picolinic acid, quinaldic acid, histidine, cystathionine, riboflavin, tetrahydrobiopterin and chenodeoxyglycocholic acid, in addition to previously reported biomarkers. Treatment of CA with TCE reverted the levels of most of the biomarkers except tetrahydrobiopterin levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the measurement of these urine metabolites could be used as a non-invasive diagnostic method for the detection of CA. As TCE treatment significantly reversed the affected pathways without any side effect. Overall, the present data depicts that TCE may be used either alone or adjunct in reducing alcohol-induced disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has been a steady rise in number of patients suffering from dementia including dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease. Effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease dementia is an unmet medical need. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of formulation containing combination of Phyllanthus emblica (Pe) and Tinospora cordifolia (Tc) with and without Ocimum sanctum (Os) on learning and memory performance of normal and memory impaired rats in complex maze and compare with effects of Tinospora cordifolia and Phyllanthus emblica alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats; either sex (100-150 g) were divided in seven groups Control, Piracetam, Rivastigmine, Tc, Pe, Formulation 1 (Tc + Pe), and Formulation 2 (Tc + Pe + Os). The study was divided in four parts: In part 1 memory enhancement was tested in normal rats. In part 2, 3, and 4 the effects of drugs were tested in Scopolamine-, Diazepam-, and Cyclosporine-induced amnesia. Hebb-Williams maze was used to test for learning and memory. Time required to trace food and number of errors in maze were noted. RESULTS: In normal rats, all test drugs showed significant reduction in time required to trace the food and number of errors after 24 h compared with vehicle control. Formulations 1 and 2 reduced the time required to trace food and number of errors and the results were comparable with positive control groups and comparators Tc and Pe. Formulations 1 and 2 reversed amnesia produced by Scopolamine, Diazepam, and Cyclosporine when compared with vehicle control and showed comparable results with those of positive control groups and comparators Tc and Pe. CONCLUSION: Formulations 1 and 2 demonstrated nootropic activity and both the formulations showed comparable nootropic activity with that of Tc and Pe alone."
