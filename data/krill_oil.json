      "abstract": "In this work, an α-amylase-inorganic hybrid catalyst with a multi-scale flower-like structure is designed and applied for the selective pre-treatment of starch to produce high-quality Antarctic krill oil octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modified starch microcapsules. Unlike the conventional free enzyme pretreatment hydrolysis process, which randomly disrupts the starch structure, the α-amylase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower catalyst can selectively hydrolyze branched-chain starch, thereby exposing more concentrated reaction sites for subsequent esterification reaction. The resulting OSA-modified starch exhibits excellent emulsification and encapsulation properties, and the resultant Pickering emulsion demonstrates effective protection of the embedded active substances and Antarctic krill oil. After 15 days of storage, the particle size remains essentially unchanged. This work is expected to contribute to the development of a novel starch-based emulsifier for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the effects of krill- and fish-oil interventions on clinical symptoms and metabolic risk factors in individuals with MDD. METHODS: In this randomized study, 57 adults diagnosed with MDD were allocated to receive krill-oil (520 mg EPA + DHA), fish-oil (600 mg EPA + DHA), or a placebo (soybean-oil) daily for 8 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, depression anxiety stress-21 (DASS-21) scale, and Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) were performed at baseline and 4 and 8 weeks. In addition, venous blood samples were collected at baseline and post-intervention to evaluate lipid and glycemic profiles, including fasting glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-c, and HDL-c levels.SPSS and R Studio software programs were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants completed the study, with 17 in each intervention group and 16 in the placebo. The mean HDRS scores decreased significantly in both the krill-oil (8.5 ± 1.2) and fish-oil groups (10.0 ± 1.2) compared to the placebo (p < 0.001), indicating clinical symptom improvement. Furthermore, the interaction effect of group-by-time was found to be statistically significant (η2p = 0.273;ptime×group < 0.001). Anxiety and distress scores decreased to similar levels after the post-intervention compared to baseline in krill- and fish-oil groups. Krill- and fish-oil supplementation increased plasma HDL-c and uric acid levels, but the group-by-time interaction effect was only observed at the HDL-c level (η2p = 0.238;ptime×group = 0.002). The mean HbA1c rates and plasma triglyceride levels of krill-oil recipients were lower after the post-intervention. CONCLUSION: Krill- and fish-oil could be considered as a safe and effective adjuvant treatments for depression. However, there was no evidence of apparent superiority over each other.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Krill oil is a dietary supplement derived from Antarctic krill; a small crustacean found in the ocean. Krill oil is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, as well as the antioxidant astaxanthin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of krill oil supplementation, compared to placebo oil (high oleic sunflower oil added astaxanthin), in vivo on energy metabolism and substrate turnover in human skeletal muscle cells. METHODS: Skeletal muscle cells (myotubes) were obtained before and after a 7-week krill oil or placebo oil intervention, and glucose and oleic acid metabolism and leucine accumulation, as well as effects of different stimuli in vitro, were studied in the myotubes. The functional data were combined with proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: In vivo intervention with krill oil increased oleic acid oxidation and leucine accumulation in skeletal muscle cells, however no effects were observed on glucose metabolism. The krill oil-intervention-induced increase in oleic acid oxidation correlated negatively with changes in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration. In addition, myotubes were also exposed to krill oil in vitro. The in vitro study revealed that 24 h of krill oil treatment increased both glucose and oleic acid metabolism in myotubes, enhancing energy substrate utilization. Transcriptomic analysis comparing myotubes obtained before and after krill oil supplementation identified differentially expressed genes associated with e.g., glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, metabolic pathways and calcium signaling pathway, while proteomic analysis demonstrated upregulation of e.g., LDL-receptor in myotubes obtained after the krill oil intervention. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that krill oil intervention promotes increased fuel metabolism and protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle cells, with potential implications for metabolic health."

METHODS: In this study, the protective effects of dietary supplementation with krill oil (KO), fish oil (FO), and astaxanthin (ASX) on an ethanol-induced gastric ulcer model were compared during biochemical and histological observations. Sprague-Dawley (n = 64) rats randomly divided into four groups-normal control (vehicle), KO, FO, and ASX groups-received the supplements via the orogastric route at a rate of 2.5% (v/w) of their daily feed consumption for 4 weeks. Then, ulcer induction was performed with ethanol. RESULTS: The ulcer group showed increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), chemiluminescence (CL), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and decreased levels of glutathione in the gastric tissues. While KO, FO, and ASX supplementation decreased chemiluminescence levels in the ulcer group, only ASX supplementation decreased MDA levels and MPO activity. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, supplementation with KO or FO has a similar protective effect against ethanol-induced ulcer damage, as it inhibits ROS formation and reduces lipid peroxidation. However, ASX supplementation has a higher protective effect than KO or FO supplementations against experimental ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats, as it inhibits ROS formation and reduces neutrophil infiltration and lipid peroxidation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With little to no regulation of the supplement markets and a paucity of quality information regarding clinical utility of individual marketed supplements, it is difficult for veterinarians to provide any evidence-based recommendations to owners. The current study aimed to provide clinically useful comparative efficacy data on certain marketed supplements. METHODS: Using a prospective, block-randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design, one hundred and one pet dogs with clinical hip OA-associated pain with one side worse than the other (index limb) were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: Green lipped Mussel plus Krill oil extracts (Antinol® Rapid, EAB-277); Biota orientalis extracts (4CYTE™ Epiitalis® Forte); an NSAID (meloxicam); or placebo (sunflower oil). Peak vertical force (PVF, expressed as a percentage of bodyweight) of the index limb, orthopedic assessment score (OAS) and hematology and blood chemistry values were evaluated before treatment (week 0), at 2, 4 and 6 weeks during treatment. RESULTS: At 6 weeks, the changes from baseline in PVF of the index limb in the EAB-277 and meloxicam groups were significantly greater than the change in the placebo and 4CYTE™ groups, and the placebo and 4CYTE groups were not different from each other. At 6 weeks, there were significant differences between the groups for overall OAS scores with the lowest scores (least impairment) in the EAB-277 and meloxicam groups, followed by the 4CYTE group and then the placebo group. DISCUSSION: Results of this study indicate that meloxicam and EAB-277 have significant objectively measured benefits in managing OA-related pain in dogs compared to placebo, but 4CYTE does not differ from placebo."

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the effects of two different types of fat (krill oil [KO] and coconut oil [CO]) on obesity, behavioral tests, and some inflammatory markers when consumed with a high-fat or control diet in rats with depression. The study was conducted mainly in two phases: the induction of depression (37 days) and the dietary intervention (60 days). After the induction of depression by chronic unpredictable mild stress, dietary intervention started. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups with 10 rats in each group: (1) standard diet (SD), (2) SD + 5% KO, (3) SD + 5% medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)* (*CO to contain 5% MCT), (4) high-fat diet (HFD), (5) HFD + 5% KO, and (6) HFD + 5% MCT*. The open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and sucrose preference test were performed at baseline, end of the depression induction, and dietary intervention to observe behavioral changes in rats. After the final behavioral test, animals were sacrificed, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analyses C-reactive protein (milligram per liter), cortisol (microgram per deciliter), and insulin (micro-international units per milliliter) to assess inflammatory changes in the blood. All data were analyzed under two headings: baseline, end of depression induction, end of dietary intervention, and dietary intervention groups. Body weight gain was highest in the SD+KO and lowest in the SD+MCT group (P < .05). When behavioral tests were evaluated according to dietary intervention, it was found that the SD+MCT group spent the most time in the center, the least time in the periphery, and the lowest immobilization time (P < .05). In FST, the SD+KO with the highest weight gain was the most immobile group (P < .05). The study indicates that the weight-reducing effects of MCTs resulted in positive behavioral responses, particularly in OFT and FST. Through these properties, MCTs can be used medicinally in the prevention and treatment of behavioral changes due to depression.",

In total, 30 dogs with stifle OA were randomized and divided into the placebo, krill oil, and CBD + krill oil groups. The Canine Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire was used to evaluate the efficacy of each treatment against pain. Stifle temperature was monitored to identify degrees of stifle inflammation. Two and one dogs in the placebo group were excluded from the study due to worsening lameness and increased pain interference score (PIS) and pain severity score (PSS) at days 14 and 28, respectively. The PIS and PSS scores of the krill oil and CBD + krill oil groups gradually and significantly improved after two weeks of treatment. The CBD + krill oil group had better PIS and PSS scores than the placebo and krill oil groups. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the PIS and PSS scores between the krill oil and CBD + krill oil groups. The stifle temperature of the three groups at different periods did not significantly differ. In conclusion, CBD + krill oil supplements are safe against canine OA.

Liver injury results from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and in turn accelerates T2DM development by exacerbating insulin resistance. However, effective approaches for mitigating DLI are surprisingly rare. Krill oil (KO) is an alternative source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, possessing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. Here we investigated the effect of KO supplementation on DLI in a mouse model of T2DM induced by streptozotocin and high-fat diet. The diabetic mice developed glucose intolerance, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and hepatic pathological injuries such as vacuolation, lipid accumulation and fibrosis deposition, the effects of which were mitigated by KO. Further investigation showed that KO ameliorated the DM-induced expression of fibrotic and inflammatory genes. Notably, KO dramatically reduced hepatic oxidative gene expression, lipid peroxidation and ROS production, all of which are hallmarks of ferroptosis. The inhibitory effect of KO on ferroptosis was confirmed by the KO-decreased hepatic expression of GPX4, COX2 and ACSL4, as well as the KO-reduced hepatic iron deposition. Further, KO restored hepatic NRF2 antioxidant signaling which combats ferroptosis. The present study may provide KO supplementation as a viable approach for the intervention of DLI.",

This study sought to ascertain the frequency of omega-3 deficiency in patients with SLE and investigate whether supplementation with krill oil concentrate (KOC) could replenish omega-3 levels and decrease SLE disease activity. METHODS: A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adult patients with active SLE. Eligible patients were randomised to receive 4 g/day KOC or placebo (vegetable oil mixture) for the first 24 weeks, and thereafter patients could opt to enter an open-label extension. The primary end point was improvement of the red blood cell Omega-3 Index from baseline to week 24. Changes in clinical features, including SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) disease activity scores, were also monitored. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients met eligibility criteria and were randomised to a treatment group (n=39 per group). The baseline Omega-3 Index in the total SLE cohort was a mean 4.43% (±SD 1.04%). After 4 weeks of KOC treatment, the Omega-3 Index rapidly increased to 7.17%±1.48% (n=38) and after 24 weeks to 8.05%±1.79% (n=25) (each p<0.001 vs baseline), whereas no significant change from baseline was noted in patients receiving placebo. Increases in the Omega-3 Index in KOC-treated patients persisted through week 48. After patients switched from placebo to KOC at 24 weeks, the mean Omega-3 Index showed a rapid and significant increase (from 4.63%±1.39% at week 24 (n=26) to 7.50%±1.75% at week 48 (n=12); p<0.001). Although there were no changes in disease activity in the study population overall, SLEDAI-2K scores decreased significantly in the KOC group during the 24-week randomised period among those who had high disease activity at baseline (SLEDAI-2K ≥9) (p=0.04, p=0.02 and p=0.01 vs placebo at 4, 8 and 16 weeks, respectively; n=9 per group). KOC was well-tolerated, with no significant safety concerns. CONCLUSION: KOC corrected omega-3 deficiency in patients with SLE. Supplementation with KOC was safe and decreased disease activity in those with more active disease. These findings warrant further evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with KOC in the management of SLE. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03626311.",

      "abstract": "Krill oil is extracted from krill, a small crustacean in the Antarctic Ocean. It has received growing attention because of krill oil's unique properties and diverse health benefits. Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that it has potential therapeutic benefits in preventing the development of a range of chronic conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Krill oil is enriched with long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, and the potent antioxidant astaxanthin, contributing to its therapeutic properties. The possible underlying mechanisms of krill oil's health benefits include anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, maintaining intestinal barrier functions, and modulating gut microbiota. This review aims to provide an overview of the beneficial effects of krill oil and its bioactive components on intestinal inflammation and to discuss the findings on the molecular mechanisms associated with the role of krill oil in IBD prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The potential role of krill oil (KO) supplementation on cardiovascular health are inconsistent in several clinical trials. Therefore, our present meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the impacts of supplementation of KO on cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVDRFs). METHODS: Intervention trials assessing KO supplementation on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes were systematically retrieved for pooling. The primary outcome was lipid profile. Secondary outcomes were consisted by blood pressure, glycemic indices, body composition together with inflammatory markers. We synthesized the effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals and weighted mean difference. To explore the heterogeneity source, we employed meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Quality assessment, publication bias, sensitivity-analysis and the certainty of evidence were also carried out. RESULTS: We included 14 trials (18 treatment arms) with 1458 participants. KO supplementation had beneficial effects on total cholesterol (P = 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.006), and triglycerides (P = 0.0005). However, no effects were found for other CVDRFs, such as blood pressure, glycemic control, body composition as well as inflammatory markers. Subgroup analyses indicated that these notably favorable effects were observed in trials with a parallel design, treatment duration <8 weeks and subjects with baseline body mass index <28 kg/m2. The above findings remained consistent in the sensitivity analysis, without obvious publication bias detected. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence demonstrated that daily KO supplementation may as a candidate for lipid management strategies. In future, studies should pay attention to the relationships of KO intake with the incidence of CVD events or all-cause mortality.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Alzheimer's disease is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder. Mounting studies focus on the improvement of advanced cognitive impairment by dietary nutrients. Krill oil (KO), a rich source of DHA/EPA and astaxanthin, is effective in improving cognitive function. The study mainly investigates the protective effects of long-term KO administration on early cognitive impairment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Results show that 2 months KO administration (50 and 100 mg kg-1 BW) can dramatically promote learning and memory abilities. Mechanism studies demonstrate that KO reduces amyloid β concentration by regulating the amyloidogenic pathway, inhibits neuro-inflammation via regulating TLR4-NLRP3 signaling pathway, and prevents neuron injure. KO supplementation also enhances gut barrier integrity, reduces serum lipopolysaccharide leakage, and alters the gut microbiota by reducing Helicobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae proportion, increasing Dubosiella and Akkermansia relative abundance. Particularly, a significant increase of isovaleric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid levels is observed after KO supplementation. Correlation analysis shows that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), gut microbiota, and cognitive function are strongly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal that KO relieves early mild cognitive impairment possibly for its role in mediating the gut microbiome-SCFAs-brain axis. Thus, KO may provide potential intervention strategies to prevent cognitive impairment in the early stages through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "The current study investigated the antiadipogenic mechanism of krill oil from the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The krill oil adhered to the criteria as a food standard by showing 50.8% of the total phospholipid, 5.27% myristic acid, and 1.63% linoleic acid. The lipid accumulation that was measured in the 3T3-L1 cells using oil red O staining was reduced up to 54% by the krill oil. The krill oil treatment reduced the adipogenic transcription factors by downregulating the sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), phospho-ACC, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. The current study confirmed that the krill oil inhibited adipogenesis by downregulating SREBP1 and ACC via the upregulation of the AMPK and nuclear factors E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings suggest that krill oil is a good source of phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine, which could be a potential natural antiobesity ingredient by inhibiting adipogenesis."

This study investigated its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-wrinkle, and moisturizing effects on skin cells and UVB-induced skin photoaging in hairless mice. In vitro assays on HDF, HaCaT, and B16/F10 cells, as well as in vivo experiments on 60 hairless mice were conducted. A cell viability assay, diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity test, elastase inhibition assay, procollagen content test, MMP-1 inhibition test, and hyaluronan production assay were used to experiment on in vitro cell models. Mice received oral KO administration (100, 200, or 400 mg/kg) once a day for 15 weeks and UVB radiation three times a week. L-Ascorbic acid (L-AA) was orally administered at 100 mg/kg once daily for 15 weeks, starting from the initial ultraviolet B (UVB) exposures. L-AA administration followed each UVB session (0.18 J/cm2) after one hour. In vitro, KO significantly countered UVB-induced oxidative stress, reduced wrinkles, and prevented skin water loss by enhancing collagen and hyaluronic synthesis. In vivo, all KO dosages showed dose-dependent inhibition of oxidative stress-induced inflammatory photoaging-related skin changes. Skin mRNA expressions for hyaluronan synthesis and collagen synthesis genes also increased dose-dependently after KO treatment. Histopathological analysis confirmed that krill oil (KO) ameliorated the damage caused by UVB-irradiated skin tissues. The results imply that KO could potentially act as a positive measure in diminishing UVB-triggered skin photoaging and address various skin issues like wrinkles and moisturization when taken as a dietary supplement.",

      "abstract": "The pathology of depression involves various factors including the interaction between genes and the environment. The deficiency of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in the brain and depressive symptoms are closely related. Krill oil contains abundant amounts of n-3 PUFAs incorporated in phosphatidylcholine. However, the effect of krill oil treatment on depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress and its molecular mechanism in the brain remain poorly understood. Here, we used a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model to evaluate the effect of krill oil on depression-like behaviors and explored its molecular mechanism through lipid metabolomics and mRNA profiles in the whole brain. We observed that CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors were ameliorated by krill oil supplementation in mice. The metabolism of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids was disrupted by CUMS treatment, which were ameliorated after krill oil supplementation. Further analysis found that differently expressed genes after krill oil supplementation were mainly enriched in the membrane structures and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, which may be responsible for the amelioration of CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors. Altogether, our results uncovered the relationship between lipid metabolism and CUMS, and provided new strategies for the prevention and treatment of depression."

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is frequently diagnosed hormonal disorder with reproductive and metabolic complications. The most common symptoms include cyst in ovaries, anovulation, insulin resistance, and obesity. Clomiphene citrate, an ovulating agent, is the first-line drug used to treat PCOS. We hypothesized that clomiphene citrate, by stimulating ovarian function, with krill oil used as an oil phase to improve solubility, by addressing PCOS-associated symptoms might be effective in PCOS. Hence, our goal was to target hormonal imbalance along with PCOS-associated symptoms using a single formulation. The concentration of water (X1), oil (X2), and Smix (surfactant-cosurfactant mixture) (X3) were selected as independent variables, in a simplex lattice design, from microemulsion area derived from a pseuodoternary phase diagram while the globule size (Y1) was selected as a dependent parameter. The optimized microemulsion showed good sphericity having 41 nm globule size, 0.32 poly dispersibility index and + 31 mV zeta potential. The optimized microemulsion was further evaluated in-vivo using letrozole-induced PCOS rats. Formulation treated group reversed the effect of letrozole on body weight and estrus cycle in comparison to the disease control group (p < 0.001). The formulation was also effective in reducing insulin resistance, cholesterol and serum testosterone level (p < 0.001). The in vivo results were supported by histopathological studies where the formulation-treated group showed a marked decrease in the number of cystic follicles and a remarkable increase in the number of growing follicles at variable stages, similar to the normal control group. Thus, the results confirmed that novel krill oil-based clomiphene microemulsion may become a promising therapeutic choice for the treatment of PCOS.",

Evidence suggests that supplementation with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3) promotes increased lipolysis and the reduction of body mass. Likewise, this clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with krill oil on waist circumference and sagittal abdominal diameter in overweight women. This pilot, balanced, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study was carried out with 26 women between 20 and 59 years old, with a body mass index >25 kg/m2. The participants were divided into the control (CG) (n = 15, 3 g/daily of mineral oil) and krill oil (GK) (n = 16, 3 g/daily of krill oil) groups, and received the supplementation for eight weeks. Food intake variables were obtained using a 24 h food recall. Anthropometric measurements (body mass, body mass index, waist circumference, and sagittal abdominal diameter) and handgrip strength were obtained. After the intervention, no changes were found for the anthropometric and handgrip strength variables (p > 0.05). Regarding food intake, differences were found for carbohydrate (p = 0.040) and polyunsaturated (p = 0.006) fatty acids, with a reduction in the control group and an increase in krill oil. In conclusion, supplementation with krill oil did not reduce the waist circumference and sagittal abdominal diameter. Therefore, more long-term studies with a larger sample size are necessary to evaluate the possible benefits of krill oil supplementation in overweight women.",

To date, few effective approaches have been developed for the treatment of diabetic wounds. Krill oil (KO) contains bioactive components that have potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. As prolonged inflammation is a crucial contributor to DM-impaired wound healing, we speculated that the local application of KO would accelerate diabetic wound healing. Therefore, KO was applied to artificially created wounds of type 2 diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin and high-fat diet. The diabetic mice had a delayed wound healing process compared with the non-diabetic control mice, with excessive inflammation, impaired collagen deposition, and depressed neovascularization in the wound area. These effects were dramatically reversed by KO. In vitro, KO blocked the TNF-α-induced macrophage inflammation, fibroblast dysfunction, and endothelial angiogenic impairment. The present study in mice suggests that KO local application could be a viable approach in the management of diabetic wounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of chronic pain and disability worldwide. Treatment generally focuses on symptom relief through nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics, which may incur side effects. Krill oil, rich in anti-inflammatory long-chain (LC) omega-3 ( ω-3) PUFAs and astaxanthin, may be a safe and effective alternative treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the effects of a commercially available krill oil supplement on knee pain in adults with mild to moderate knee OA. Secondary outcomes were knee stiffness; physical function; NSAID use; Omega-3 Index; and lipid, inflammatory, and safety markers. METHODS: Healthy adults (n = 235, 40-65 y old, BMI >18.5 to <35 kg/m2), clinically diagnosed with mild to moderate knee OA, regular knee pain, and consuming <0.5 g/d LC ω-3 PUFAs, participated in a 6-mo double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Participants consumed either 4 g krill oil/d (0.60 g EPA/d, 0.28 g DHA/d, 0.45 g astaxanthin/d) or placebo (mixed vegetable oil). Knee outcomes were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) numeric scale (normalized to scores of 0-100). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 mo, and 6 mo. RESULTS: Omega-3 Index increased with the krill oil supplement compared with placebo (from 6.0% to 8.9% compared with from 5.5% to 5.4%, P < 0.001). Knee pain score improved in both groups with greater improvements for krill oil than for placebo (difference in adjusted mean change between groups at 6 mo: -5.18; 95% CI: -10.0, -0.32; P = 0.04). Knee stiffness and physical function also had greater improvements with krill oil than with placebo (difference in adjusted mean change between groups at 6 mo: -6.45; 95% CI: -12.1, -0.9 and -4.67; 95% CI: -9.26, -0.05, respectively; P < 0.05). NSAID use, serum lipids, and inflammatory and safety markers did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Krill oil was safe to consume and resulted in modest improvements in knee pain, stiffness, and physical function in adults with mild to moderate knee OA.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03483090.",

Previous research studies have demonstrated that krill oil is helpful to improve locomotion via antioxidation and regulation of energy metabolism, but the alteration of relevant lipids and mechanisms still remains unclear. In this study, we observed recovery in the impairment of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) caused by acrylamide using the krill oil. Locomotion assays indicated that the supplement of krill oil enhanced head thrashes and body bends by 16.4% and 19.3% respectively in impaired C. elegans. The altered expressions of genes related to neuron status (dat-1), antioxidants (sod-3 and gst-4) and energy metabolism (daf-2 and akt-1) in impaired C. elegans were also reversed by treatment with krill oil. Lipidomics analysis suggested that krill oil could restore the metabolic changes induced by acrylamide, including the downregulation of ceramides and fatty acids and the upregulation of glycerophospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Some of these lipids also showed significant correlations with the varied genes. In conclusion, krill oil could ameliorate the locomotion of impaired C. elegans via suppressing the oxidative stress and promoting energy supply. Our findings facilitate the functional studies of krill oil.",

      "abstract": "Krill oil (KO) obtained from Euphausia superba is nutrient-rich and has a positive effect on human health. Here, we explored the efficacy of KO in inhibiting tumor progression and tumor vascularization. KO (100-300 μg/mL) repressed the proliferation of bladder tumor cell lines MBT-2 and T24. Treatment of cells with KO raised cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1-phase via modulation of positive regulators and negative regulators in bladder cancer cells. KO treatment regulated phosphorylation of proteins involved in PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Additionally, KO hampered the invasion and migration of both cell lines via reduction of MMP-9 expression levels by disrupting transcriptional binding of Sp-1, AP-1, and NF-κB motifs. Moreover, in animal studies, KO (150-300 mg/kg) significantly decreased tumor growth in xenograft mice bearing T24 tumor cells. No significant toxic effects were observed in acute toxicity tests, including biological analysis and H&E staining. The reduced level of CD31 expression in KO-treated tumor tissues prompted us to investigate the effect of KO on tumor angiogenesis. KO (5-40 μg/mL) treatment impeded VEGF-induced capillary tube formation and proliferation by inhibiting VEGFR2-modulated eNOS/AKT/ERK1/2 signaling axis in HUVECs. Treatment of HUVECs with KO inhibited VEGF-stimulated migration and invasion by reducing MMP-2 expression level. VEGF-driven sprouting capacity of neo-microvessels was suppressed in the presence of KO (20-40 μg/mL), as determined via an ex vivo aortic ring assay. Our results indicated that KO can regulate both tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis via a novel mechanism. Thus, KO may be a promising antitumor candidate, potentially useful to prevent or treat bladder cancer.",

      "abstract": "Bile acids (BAs) metabolism plays an important role in alcohol liver disease through the gut microflora-bile acids-liver axis. Antarctic Krill Oil (AKO) has protective effects on the liver, while whether AKO can protect against liver injury caused by alcohol is unclear. This study investigated the effects of AKO on BAs metabolism and intestinal microbiota in a rat model of alcohol-induced liver disease. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, model group, low-dose AKO-treatment group (100 mg/kg/d), high-dose AKO-treatment group (200 mg/kg/d), and AKO control group (200 mg/kg/d). Administration of alcohol (8 to 10 mL/kg/d) for 16 weeks induced liver injury in rats. We found that AKO supplementation significantly protected the liver against alcohol-induced injury, evidenced by allayed hepatic histopathological changes, and inhibited the alcohol-induced elevation of serum biochemical indices. Furthermore, AKO could regulate BAs metabolism by activating the intestinal-hepatic FXR-FGF15-FGFR4 signaling axis with subsequently decreased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) levels, reduced hepatic BAs production, decreased serum BAs level and increased fecal excretion of BAs. Additionally, 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the gut microbiome richness and composition were altered in alcohol-treated rats in comparison to the control and AKO-administrated rats. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that differential gut bacterial genera correlated with the levels of BAs profiles in the serum, liver, and feces. These findings suggested that AKO dietary supplementation may protect against alcohol-induced liver injury through modulating BAs metabolism and altering the gut microbiome.",

METHODS: Men and women, aged above 65 years, with a BMI less than 35kg/m2, who participated in less than 1h per week of structured self-reported exercise, were enrolled in the study (NCT04048096) between March 2018 and March 2020. Participants were randomised to either control or krill oil supplements (4g/day) for 6 months in this double blind randomised controlled trial. At baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months, knee extensor maximal torque was measured as the primary outcome of the study. Secondary outcomes measured were grip strength, vastus lateralis muscle thickness, short performance physical battery test, body fat, muscle mass, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, and C-Reactive Protein, neuromuscular (M-Wave, RMS and voluntary activation), and erythrocyte fatty acid composition. RESULTS: A total of 102 men and women were enrolled in the study. Ninety-four participants (krill group (26 women and 23 men) and placebo group (27 women and 18 men)) completed the study (mean (SD): age 71.2 (5.1) years and weight 71.8 (12.3) kg). Six months supplementation with krill oil resulted in, an increase in knee extensor maximal torque, grip strength and vastus lateralis muscle thickness, relative to control (p<0.05). The 6-month treatment effects were 9.3% (95%CI: 2.8, 15.8%), 10.9% (95%CI: 8.3, 13.6%) and 3.5% (95%CI: 2.1, 4.9%) respectively. Increases in erythrocyte fatty acid profile were seen with krill oil for EPA 214% (95%CI: 166, 262%), DHA 36% (95%CI: 24, 48%) and the omega-3 index 61% (95%CI: 49, 73%), relative to control (p < 0.05). Krill oil resulted in an increased, relative to control (p < 0.05), M-Wave of 17% (95%CI: 12.7, 38.1%) but there was no effect of krill oil on RMS, voluntary activation, or on any other secondary outcomes such as performance of the short performance physical battery test or quality of life. CONCLUSION: Krill oil supplementation for 6 months results in statistically and clinically significant increases in muscle function and size in healthy older adults. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04048096.",

This study aimed to compare the anti-cancer effects of KO with a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug, oxaliplatin and to identify the molecular mechanisms associated with KO supplementation in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Thirty-six male Balb/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. Five groups received standard chow diet supplemented with KO (150 g/kg)), corn oil (150 g/kg), KO combined with ½ dose of oxaliplatin (1.5 mg/kg body weight/3 times per week), corn oil combined with ½ dose of oxaliplatin (1.5 mg/kg body weight/3 times per week), or a full dose of oxaliplatin (3 mg/kg body weight/3 times per week). The control (sham) group received a standard chow diet. Treatments started three weeks before and continued for three weeks after orthotopic CRC induction. The number of metastases, tumour weight and volume were quantified ex-vivo. The expression of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-9 and -3, DNA damage, PD-L1, PD-L2 and HSP-70 were determined. RESULTS: A significant reductions in the weight and volume of tumours were observed in mice treated with KO and KO plus a ½ dose of oxaliplatin compared to the sham group, similar to oxaliplatin-treated mice. KO, and KO plus ½ dose of oxaliplatin significantly increased the expression of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-9 and -3, and DNA damage and decreased expression of PD-L1, PD-L2 and HSP-70 in tumour tissues compared to the sham group. CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo anti-cancer effects of KO are comparable with oxaliplatin. Thus, dietary KO supplementation has a great potential as a therapeutic/adjunctive agent for CRC treatment."

We found that 150 mg/kg b.w. FJH-KO supplementation increased running speed, stride, and foot pressure in MIA-induced osteoarthritic rats. In the H2O2-treated SW982 synovial cell line and primary chondrocytes, FJH-KO treatment prevented cell death and suppressed matrix degradation by increasing the levels of anabolic factors of cartilage tissue, including aggrecan, collagen type Ⅰ, collagen type Ⅱ, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and TIMP-3, and decreasing those of catabolic factors of cartilage tissue, including phosphorylation of Smad, MMP-3, and MMP-13. In addition, FJH-KO treatment suppressed the activation of inflammation and apoptosis pathways in the LPS-treated SW982 synovial cell line and primary chondrocytes. We suggest that FJH-KO supplementation may help prevent osteoarthritis progression because of its direct effects on inflammation and apoptosis of chondrocytes.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), resulting in high mortality. Myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammatory cell infiltration are hallmarks of DCM, leading to cardiac dysfunction. To date, few effective approaches have been developed for the intervention of DCM. In the present study, we investigate the effect of krill oil (KO) on the prevention of DCM using a mouse model of DM induced by streptozotocin and a high-fat diet. The diabetic mice developed pathological features, including cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, the effects of which were remarkably prevented by KO. Mechanistically, KO reversed the DM-induced cardiac expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory genes and attenuated DM-enhanced cardiac oxidative stress. Notably, KO exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome that plays an important role in DCM. Further investigation showed that KO significantly upregulated the expression of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), which are negative regulators of NLRP3. The present study reports for the first time the preventive effect of KO on the pathological injuries of DCM, providing SIRT3, PGC-1α and NLRP3 as molecular targets of KO. This work suggests that KO supplementation may be a viable approach in clinical prevention of DCM.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Intense interest exists in novel ω-3 formulations with high bioavailability to reduce blood triglyceride (TG) levels. OBJECTIVE: To determine the phase 3 efficacy and safety of a naturally derived krill oil with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid as both phospholipid esters (PLs) and free fatty acids (FFAs) (ω-3-PL/FFA [CaPre]), measured by fasting TG levels and other lipid parameters in severe hypertriglyceridemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study pooled the results of 2 identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. TRILOGY 1 (Study of CaPre in Lowering Very High Triglycerides) enrolled participants at 71 US centers from January 23, 2018, to November 20, 2019; TRILOGY 2 enrolled participants at 93 US, Canadian, and Mexican centers from April 6, 2018, to January 9, 2020. Patients with fasting TG levels from 500 to 1500 mg/dL, with or without stable treatment with statins, fibrates, or other agents to lower cholesterol levels, were eligible to participate. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization (2.5:1.0) to ω-3-PL/FFA, 4 g/d, vs placebo (cornstarch) for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean percentage of change in TG levels at 12 weeks; persistence at 26 weeks was the key secondary outcome. Other prespecified secondary outcomes were effects on levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), HDL-C, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); safety and tolerability; and TG level changes in prespecified subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 520 patients were randomized, with a mean (SD) age of 54.9 (11.2) years (339 men [65.2%]), mean (SD) body mass index of 31.5 (5.1), and baseline mean (SD) TG level of 701 (222) mg/dL. Two hundred fifty-six patients (49.2%) were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; 275 (52.9%) had diabetes; and 248 (47.7%) were receiving statins. In the intention-to-treat analysis, TG levels were reduced by 26.0% (95% CI, 20.5%-31.5%) in the ω-3-PL/FFA group and 15.1% (95% CI, 6.6%-23.5%) in the placebo group at 12 weeks (mean treatment difference, -10.9% [95% CI, -20.4% to -1.5%]; P = .02), with reductions persisting at 26 weeks (mean treatment difference, -12.7% [95% CI, -23.1% to -2.4%]; P = .02). Compared with placebo, ω-3-PL/FFA had no significant effect at 12 weeks on mean treatment differences for non-HDL-C (-3.2% [95% CI, -8.0% to 1.6%]; P = .18), VLDL-C (-3.8% [95% CI, -12.2% to 4.7%]; P = .38), HDL-C (0.7% [95% CI, -3.7% to 5.1%]; P = .77), or LDL-C (4.5% [95% CI, -5.9% to 14.8%]; P = .40) levels; corresponding differences at 26 weeks were -5.8% (95% CI, -11.3% to -0.3%; P = .04) for non-HDL-C levels, -9.1% (95% CI, -21.5% to 3.2%; P = .15) for VLDL-C levels, 1.9% (95% CI, -4.8% to 8.6%; P = .57) for HDL-C levels, and 6.3% (95% CI, -12.4% to 25.0%; P = .51) for LDL-C levels. Effects on the primary end point did not vary significantly by age, sex, race and ethnicity, country, qualifying TG level, diabetes, or fibrate use but tended to be larger among patients taking statins or cholesterol absorption inhibitors at baseline (mean treatment difference, -19.5% [95% CI, -34.5% to -4.6%]; P = .08 for interaction) and with lower (less than median) baseline blood eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid levels (-19.5% [95% CI, -33.8% to -5.3%]; P = .08 for interaction). ω-3-PL/FFA was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that ω-3 -PL/FFA, a novel krill oil-derived ω-3 formulation, reduced TG levels and was safe and well tolerated in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

      "abstract": "Making Antarctic krill oil into emulsion is a good way to utilize Antarctic krill, but proliferation of microorganisms cannot be ignored. H2O2 is widely used in the sterilization of liquid food since its decomposition products are environmentally friendly, although residual H2O2 should be removed for food safety. Adding catalase (CAT) is an effective means to do this. However, the enzyme activity center of CAT is the iron porphyrin group, which has the risk of accelerating lipid oxidation in the oil emulsion. Therefore, we hypothesized that CAT might not be suitable for the removal of H2O2 in Antarctic krill oil emulsion. In this paper, Antarctic krill oil emulsion was prepared, and then the effect of CAT on the emulsion was studied through visual observation, microscopic morphology observation, turbidity and stability, particle size, and ζ-potential; finally, the mechanism of CAT destroying the emulsion was explored from the perspective of lipid oxidation. The results showed that a stable Antarctic krill emulsion was prepared using Tween-80 as the emulsifier, with the oil concentration of 1% (v/v) and the ratio of surfactant to oil phase of 1:5 (v/v). The emulsion treated with CAT had undergone demulsification, stratification, and coagulation after 2 days of incubation, while the emulsion treated with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) changed little. In addition, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value and the content of hydroxyl radicals in the CAT group increased significantly. The preliminary research results indicated that the effect of CAT on the emulsion related to the lipid oxidation caused by the iron porphyrin group at the center of the enzyme activity. All these results indicated that CAT was not suitable for the removal of residual H2O2 in Antarctic krill oil emulsion. Moreover, it is helpful to avoid the contact of Antarctic krill oil emulsion and CAT during the processing of the krill."

      "abstract": "Methamphetamine (METH) abuse exerts severe harmful effects in multiple organs, especially the brain, and can induce cognitive dysfunction and memory deficits in humans. Krill oil is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, while its effect on METH-induced cognitive impairment and mental disorders, and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of krill oil on METH-induced memory deficits and to explore the molecular mechanisms by using an integrated strategy of bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification. METH-exposed mice were treated with or without krill oil. Learning and memory functions were evaluated by the Morris water maze. The drug-component-target network was constructed in combination with network pharmacology. The predicted hub genes and pathways were validated by the Western blot technique. With krill oil treatment, memory impairment induced by METH was significantly improved. 210 predicted targets constituted the drug-compound-target network by network pharmacology analysis. 20 hub genes such as DRD2, MAPK3, CREB, BDNF, and caspase-3 were filtered out as the underlying mechanisms of krill oil on improving memory deficits induced by METH. The KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analyses showed that the MAPK signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, and dopaminergic synapse pathway were involved in the neuroprotective effects of krill oil. In the hippocampus, DRD2, cleaved caspase-3, and γ-H2AX expression levels were significantly increased in the METH group but decreased in the krill oil-treated group. Meanwhile, krill oil enhanced the expressions of p-PKA, p-ERK1/2, and p-CREB. Our findings suggested that krill oil improved METH-induced memory deficits, and this effect may occur via the MAPK signaling pathway and dopaminergic synapse pathways. The combination of network pharmacology approaches with experimental validation may offer a useful tool to characterize the molecular mechanism of multicomponent complexes."

      "abstract": "BACKROUND: This study aimed to determine the effects of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation on the prevention and treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases, and to compare the efficiency of different LC n-3 PUFA sources via biochemical and genetic mechanisms in rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomized into four study groups, and fed with a standard diet, High Fat Diet (HFD), HFD+%2.5 Fish Oil (FO-HFD) or HFD+%2.5 Krill Oil (KO-HFD) for eight weeks. Food consumption, weight gain, serum glucose, insulin, ghrelin and leptin concentrations, lipid profile, liver fatty acid composition, and FADS1 and FADS2 mRNA gene expression levels were measured. RESULTS: Weight gain in each HFD group was significantly higher than control group (p < 0.001), without any differences among them (p < 0.05). LC n-3 PUFAs modified lipid profile, but not glucose tolerance. Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in HFD groups than in the control group, however, no difference in serum ghrelin levels was observed among the groups. Liver n-3 fatty acid desaturation activity was higher (p = 0.74), and liver total lipid content was lower (p = 0.86) in KO-HFD compared to FO-HFD. FADS1 gene expression was highest in the HFD group (p < 0.001) while FADS2 gene expression was highest in the FO-HFD group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: LC n-3 PUFAs, especially krill oil, had moderate effects on lipid profile, but limited effects on obesity related parameters, suggesting different effects of different sources on gene expression levels. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy of different LC n-3 PUFA sources in the prevention and treatment of obesity in humans."

      "abstract": "There has been an increasing number of studies on the interaction between active substances and probiotics to improve disease. Both krill oil (KO) and probiotics have the effect of improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the combined effect has not been explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the improvement effect of KO combined with probiotics on atherosclerosis. The atherosclerotic plaque area of ApoE-/- mice was detected after the intervention of KO, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis F1-7 (Bif. animalis F1-7), and KO combined with Bif. animalis F1-7. The results showed that Bif. animalis F1-7, KO, and KO combined with Bif. animalis F1-7 could significantly reduce the area of atherosclerotic plaque and improve the levels of serum lipids and inflammatory factors. They could regulate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1) pathway to reduce lipid accumulation. The intervention groups could also improve the inflammatory response by downregulating the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) pathway. The anti-inflammatory effect of the interaction group was significantly better than that of KO. It proved that Bif. animalis F1-7 might play a synergistic effect in the improvement of inflammation by KO to the alleviation of atherosclerosis."

      "abstract": "The development of obesity is characterized by the metabolic overload of tissues and subsequent organ inflammation. The health effects of krill oil (KrO) on obesity-associated inflammation remain largely elusive, because long-term treatments with KrO have not been performed to date. Therefore, we examined the putative health effects of 28 weeks of 3% (w/w) KrO supplementation to an obesogenic diet (HFD) with fat derived mostly from lard. The HFD with KrO was compared to an HFD control group to evaluate the effects on fatty acid composition and associated inflammation in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and the liver during obesity development. KrO treatment increased the concentrations of EPA and DHA and associated oxylipins, including 18-HEPE, RvE2 and 14-HDHA in eWAT and the liver. Simultaneously, KrO decreased arachidonic acid concentrations and arachidonic-acid-derived oxylipins (e.g., HETEs, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, TXB2). In eWAT, KrO activated regulators of adipogenesis (e.g., PPARγ, CEBPα, KLF15, STAT5A), induced a shift towards smaller adipocytes and increased the total adipocyte numbers indicative for hyperplasia. KrO reduced crown-like structures in eWAT, and suppressed HFD-stimulated inflammatory pathways including TNFα and CCL2/MCP-1 signaling. The observed eWAT changes were accompanied by reduced plasma leptin and increased plasma adiponectin levels over time, and improved insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In the liver, KrO suppressed inflammatory signaling pathways, including those controlled by IL-1β and M-CSF, without affecting liver histology. Furthermore, KrO deactivated hepatic REL-A/p65-NF-κB signaling, consistent with increased PPARα protein expression and a trend towards an increase in IkBα. In conclusion, long-term KrO treatment increased several anti-inflammatory PUFAs and oxylipins in WAT and the liver. These changes were accompanied by beneficial effects on general metabolism and inflammatory tone at the tissue level. The stimulation of adipogenesis by KrO allows for safe fat storage and may, together with more direct PPAR-mediated anti-inflammatory mechanisms, attenuate inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of high fat diet (HFD) increases risk of cognitive impairment and memory deficit by elevation of oxidative stress in the brain. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of krill oil (KO) against HFD-induced cognitive impairment in mice. The mice were fed with HFD for 10 weeks, and then KO was orally administered at doses of 100, 200, or 500 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks. To evaluate the cognitive abilities, we carried out the behavior tests, such as T-maze, novel object recognition test, and Morris water maze test. The HFD-induced cognitive impairment mice showed impairments in both spatial memory and novel object cognitive abilities. However, administration of KO at doses of 100, 200, or 500 mg/kg/d improved spatial memory ability and novel object cognition by increase of the exploration of new route and novel object. In addition, KO-administered group improved learning and memory abilities, showing shorter latency to reach hidden platform compared with control group. Furthermore, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide (NO) were significantly elevated by consumption of HFD, indicating that consumption of HFD induces oxidative stress in the brain. However, administration of KO attenuated oxidative stress by decrease of the ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, and NO. This study suggests that KO improves HFD-induced cognitive impairment by attenuation of oxidative stress in the brain. Therefore, KO may play as a promising agent in treatment and prevention of HFD-induced cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The currently available treatments for colorectal cancer (CRC) are often associated with serious side-effects. Therefore, the development of a novel nutraceutical agent may provide an alternative complementary therapy for CRC. Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) associates with a range of cancers while downregulation of EGFR signalling can inhibit cancer growth. Our previous studies have shown that the free fatty acid extract (FFAE) of krill oil exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties. This study determines the effects of krill oil extract on the migration of human CRC cells, and its potential role in modulating EGFR signalling pathway and the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). METHODS: Human CRC cells, DLD-1 and HT-29 were treated with FFAE of KO at 0.03 and 0.12 μL/100 μL for 8 or 24 h. Cell migration was determined by Boyden chamber migration assay. The expression of EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) as well as PD-L1 were assessed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The FFAE of krill oil significantly inhibited cell migration compared to ethanol-treated (vehicle control) cells (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001). At the molecular level, krill oil extract reduced the expression of EGFR, pEGFR (P < 0.001 for both) and their downstream signalling, pERK1/2 and pAKT (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001) without altering total ERK 1/2 and AKT levels. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 was reduced by 67 to 72% (P < 0.001) following the treatment with krill oil extract. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that krill oil may be a potential therapeutic/adjunctive agent for CRC attributed to its anti-migratory effects.. The potential anti-cancer properties of krill oil are likely to be associated with the downregulation of EGFR, pEGFR and their downstream pERK/ERK1/2 and pAKT/AKT signalling pathways along with the downregulation of PD-L1.",

The effect of FJH-KO on the development and severity of MIA-induced osteoarthritis was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and micro-CT. The expression of PGE2, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α), and arthritics related genes in osteoarthritic rats in response to FJH-KO supplementation was investigated using real time PCR. FJH-KO supplementation in the arthritic rat model reduced tissue damage, cartilage degeneration, and reduced the MIA-induced irregularities in articular cartilage surface. Serum PGE2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels were higher in MIA treated animals, but these levels decreased upon FJH-KO supplementation. When FJH-KO was provided at a dose of 150 mg/kg b.w to MIA-treated animals, it significantly increased the mRNA expression of anabolic factors. The mRNA expression of catabolic factors was significantly decreased MIA-treated animals that were provided FJH-KO at a dose of 100 and 150 mg/kg b.w. Moreover, the mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly decreased MIA-treated animals supplemented with FJH-KO. These results suggest supplementation with FJH-KO ameliorates the irregularities in articular cartilage surface and improves the inflammatory response in the osteoarthritis. Thus, FJH-KO could serve as a potential therapeutic agent for osteoarthritis treatment.",

However, n-3 LCPUFA supplementation studies investigating the potential improvement in depressive feelings in adolescents from the general population are missing. METHODS: A one-year double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled krill oil supplementation trial was conducted in two cohorts. Cohort I started with 400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or placebo, after three months this increased to 800 mg EPA and DHA per day, whilst cohort II started with this higher dose. Omega-3 Index (O3I) was monitored via finger-prick blood measurements. At baseline, six and 12 months participants completed the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Rosenberg Self Esteem questionnaire (RSE). Adjusted mixed models were run with treatment allocation/O3I as predictor of CES-D and RSE scores. RESULTS: Both intention-to-treat and assessing the change in O3I analyses did not show significant effects on CES-D or RSE scores. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence for less depressive feelings, or higher self-esteem after one year of krill oil supplementation. However, due to a lack of adherence and drop-out issues, these results should be interpreted with caution.",

Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-NF-E2-related factor 2 (KEAP1-NRF2) axis is a crucial antioxidant signaling pathway. Thus, AKO may exert its antioxidant effects on CHD patients via KEAP1-NRF2 signaling. METHODS: AKO fatty acid (FA) profiles were analyzed by using gas chromatography (GC). One hundred CHD patients were divided into the intervention (IG, AKO) and control (CG, placebo) groups. Before and after 1, 2, and 3 months of intervention, we measured serum levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and KEAP1 and NRF2 levels in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). Serum FAs were measured by GC at baseline and after 3-month intervention. RESULTS: AKO contains rich eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is more than 27% of total FA. The levels of EPA and DHA, KEAP1, and NRF2 in the IG group were higher than those in the CG group (p < 0.05). Serum levels of ROS, 8-OHdG, NO, and MDA in the IG group were lower than those in the CG group, whereas the levels of SOD, GSH, and GPx in the IG group were higher than those in the CG group (p < 0.05). Serum levels of saturated fatty acids (UFA) in the IG group were higher than those in the CG group, whereas reverse results were obtained for the levels of saturated fatty acids (SFA). Serum levels of EPA and DHA had a strong negative relationship with the level of ROS, whereas the ROS level had a strong negative relationship with the levels of KEAP1-NRF2. CONCLUSION: AKO increases antioxidant capacities of CHD patients via the KEAP1-NRF2 signaling in the PBL."

      "abstract": "The prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to increase. Treatment of CRC remains a significant clinical challenge, and effective therapies for advanced CRC are desperately needed. Increasing attention and ongoing research efforts have focused on krill oil that may provide health benefits to the human body. Here we report that krill oil exerts in vitro anticancer activity through a direct inhibition on proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of mouse colon cancer cells. Krill oil inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of CT-26 colon cancer cells by causing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cell cycle arrest was attributable to reduction of cyclin D1 levels in krill oil-treated cells. Further studies revealed that krill oil induced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis of CT-26 cells, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytosolic calcium levels, activation of caspase-3, and downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and BCL-XL. Krill oil suppressed migration of CT-26 cells by disrupting the microfilaments and microtubules. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) plays crucial roles in regulating proliferation and migration of cancer cells. We found that krill oil attenuated the activation of ERK signaling pathway to exert the effects on cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration of colon cancer cells. We speculate that polyunsaturated fatty acids of krill oil may dampen ERK activation by decreasing the phospholipid saturation of cell membrane. Although findings from in vitro studies may not necessarily translate in vivo, our study provides insights into the possibility that krill oil or its components could have therapeutic potential in colon cancer.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated the cognitive improvement effects and its mechanisms of krill oil (KO) in Aβ25-35-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. The Aβ25-35-injected AD mouse showed memory and cognitive impairment in the behavior tests. However, the administration of KO improved novel object recognition ability and passive avoidance ability compared with Aβ25-35-injected control mice in behavior tests. In addition, KO-administered mice showed shorter latency to find the hidden platform in a Morris water maze test, indicating that KO improved learning and memory abilities. To evaluate the cognitive improvement mechanisms of KO, we measured the oxidative stress-related biomarkers and apoptosis-related protein expressions in the brain. The administration of KO inhibited oxidative stress-related biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide compared with AD control mice induced by Aβ25-35. In addition, KO-administered mice showed down-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the brain. Therefore, this study indicated that KO-administered mice improved cognitive function against Aβ25-35 by attenuations of neuronal oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis. It suggests that KO might be a potential agent for prevention and treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory property of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been exploited in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with promising results. However, it remains unclear if PUFA play a significant role in the resolution of inflammation and promotion of mucosal healing. Krill oil (KO) is a natural product rich in PUFA and the potent antioxidant, astaxanthin. In this study, we attempted to understand the mechanisms through which KO modulates the gut microbiome and metabolome using in vitro and in vivo colitis models and a multi-omics based approach. RESULTS: KO significantly decreased LPS-induced IL1β and TNFα expression in human macrophages in vitro in a dose-dependent manner by regulating a broad spectrum of signaling pathways, including NF-κB and NOD-like receptor signaling, and displayed a synergistic effect with COX2 and IKK2 inhibitors in attenuating inflammatory pathways. Moreover, KO was involved in the resolution of inflammation by promoting M2 polarization and enhancing macrophage-mediated intracellular bacterial killing. Parasite-dependent intestinal mucosal damage and microbial dysbiosis induced by Trichuris suis infection in pigs were partially restored by feeding KO. KO supplementation reduced the abundance of Rickettsiales and several species of Lactobacillus, which were among the important features identified by random forests analysis contributing to classification accuracy for KO supplementation. Several microbial signatures with strong predictive power for the status of both infection and supplementation were identified. The inhibitory effect of KO on histidine metabolism was identified using untargeted metabolomics. KO supplementation reduced several key metabolites related to histamine metabolism by suppressing the expression of a gene encoding L-histidine decarboxylase in the colon mucosa and reducing histamine biosynthesis of microbial origin. Moreover, the pro-resolving properties of KO were validated using a Citrobacter rodentium-induced Th1-dependent colitis murine model. Further, microbial signatures with high prediction accuracy for colitis-related pathophysiological traits were identified in mice. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study provided a mechanistic basis for optimizing microbiome-inspired alternative therapeutics in the management of IBD. The microbial signatures identified, particularly those with strong predictive accuracy for colitis phenotypes, will facilitate the development of biomarkers associated with appropriate dietary intervention to manage intestinal inflammation.

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Currently available omega-3 fatty acid supplements do not enrich the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) of the adult brain because they are absorbed as triacylglycerol, whereas the transporter at the blood brain barrier requires lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-DHA. The hypothesis that treatment of krill oil (KO), which contains DHA/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at the SN2 position of phosphatidylcholine, with SN1-specific lipase will generate LPC-DHA/EPA and which can be absorbed intact and transported into the brain, is tested. METHODS: KO and fish oil (FO) are treated with Mucor meihei lipase, incorporated into AIN 93G diet, and fed to 2-month-old mice for 30 days. Fatty acid composition is analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Lipase-treated (LT) KO increases brain DHA and EPA, respectively, 5-and 70-fold better than untreated (UT) KO. FO, whether lipase-treated or not, has no effect on brain DHA/EPA. LTKO is also more efficient in enriching liver DHA/EPA, but less efficient than UTKO and FO in enriching adipose tissue and heart. Brain BDNF is significantly increased by LTKO, but only marginally by other preparations. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment of dietary KO with lipase enables it to efficiently increase brain DHA/EPA because of the generation of LPC-DHA/EPA.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease and a leading cause of adult disability. Since there is no cure for OA and no effective treatment to slow its progression, current pharmacologic treatments, such as analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), only alleviate symptoms, such as pain and inflammation, but do not inhibit the disease process. Moreover, chronic intake of these drugs may result in severe adverse effects. For these reasons, patients have turned to the use of various complementary and alternative approaches, including diverse dietary supplements and nutraceuticals, in an effort to improve symptoms and manage or slow disease progression. The present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-osteoarthritic effects of FlexPro MD® (a mixture of krill oil, astaxanthin, and hyaluronic acid; FP-MD) in a rat model of OA induced by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). FP-MD significantly ameliorated joint pain and decreased the severity of articular cartilage destruction in rats that received oral supplementation for 7 days prior to MIA administration and for 21 days thereafter. Furthermore, FP-MD treatment significantly reduced serum levels of the articular cartilage degeneration biomarkers cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and crosslinked C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as mRNA expression levels of inflammatory mediators, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and matrix-degrading enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, in the knee joint tissue. Our findings suggest that FP-MD is a promising dietary supplement for reducing pain, minimizing cartilage damage, and improving functional status in OA, without the disadvantages of previous dietary supplements and medicinal agents, including multiple adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and important cause of pain and disability, but interventions aimed at modifying structures visible on imaging have been disappointing. While OA affects the whole joint, synovitis and effusion have been recognised as having a role in the pathogenesis of OA. Krill oil reduces knee pain and systemic inflammation and could be used for targeting inflammatory mechanisms of OA. METHODS/DESIGN: We will recruit 260 patients with clinical knee OA, significant knee pain and effusion-synovitis present on MRI in five Australian cities (Hobart, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth). These patients will be randomly allocated to the two arms of the study, receiving 2 g/day krill oil or inert placebo daily for 6 months. MRI of the study knee will be performed at screening and after 6 months. Knee symptoms, function and MRI structural abnormalities will be assessed using validated methods. Safety data will be recorded. Primary outcomes are absolute change in knee pain (assessed by visual analog score) and change in size of knee effusion-synovitis over 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes include improvement in knee pain over 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks. The primary analyses will be intention-to-treat analyses of primary and secondary outcomes. Per protocol analyses adjusting for missing data and for treatment compliance will be performed as the secondary analyses. DISCUSSION: This study will provide high-quality evidence to assess whether krill oil 2 g/day reduces pain and effusion-synovitis size in older adults with clinical knee OA and knee effusion-synovitis. If krill oil is effective and confirmed to be safe, we will provide compelling evidence that krill oil improves pain and function, changes disease trajectory and slows disease progression in OA. Given the lack of approved therapies for slowing disease progression in OA, and moderate cost of krill oil, these findings will be readily translated into clinical practice.

In krill oil, they esterified to phospholipids, but in fish oil, they are esterified to triacylglycerols. The target of this study was to investigate whether KO could help against iron overload-induced toxicity in liver and spleen. Rats were randomly assigned into 3 categories: control rats, rats received iron in a drinking water for 8 weeks followed by either vehicle or KO (40 mg/kg) treatment for an extra 8 weeks. Extent of hepatic and splenic injury was assessed via biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluations. KO effectively improved the microscopic features of liver and spleen. Moreover, it decreased the increased levels of serum transaminases, ALP, LDH, iron, and ferritin and increased albumin serum level as well. In addition, it restored the balance between oxidants and antioxidants in the hepatic and splenic tissues. Furthermore, it decreased HO-1 levels, upregulated the production of Nrf2, and limited the expression of MMP9. These findings altogether suggest that KO might be a new candidate for treatment of iron overload-induced toxicity. Graphical abstract Graphical abstract.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently available treatments for colorectal cancer (CRC) associate with numerous side-effects that reduce patients' quality of life. The effective nutraceuticals with high anti-proliferative efficacy and low side-effects are desirable. Our previous study has reported that free fatty acids extract (FFAE) of krill oil induced apoptosis of CRC cells, possibly associated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The aims of this study were to compare the anti-proliferative efficacy of FFAE from krill oil on CRC cells with commonly used chemotherapeutic drug, Oxaliplatin, and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative effects of krill oil with a focus on intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway. METHODS: Three human CRC cell lines, including DLD-1, HT-29 and LIM-2405, and one mouse CRC cell line, CT-26, were treated with FFAE of KO and the bioactive components of krill oil, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 24 h and 48 h. Similarly, these cell lines were treated with Oxaliplatin, a commonly used drug for CRC treatment, for 24 h. The effects of FFAE of KO, EPA, DHA and Oxaliplatin on cell proliferation, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined via WST-1, JC-10, and ROS assays respectively. The expression of caspase-3, caspase-9 and DNA damage following treatments of FFAE of KO was investigated via western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The FFAE of KO, EPA and DHA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and increased formation of ROS in all four cell lines (P < 0.01). A small dose of FFAE from KO ranged from 0.06 μL/100 μL to 0.12 μL/100 μL containing low concentrations of EPA (0.13-0.52 μM) and DHA (0.06-0.26 μM) achieved similar anti-proliferative effect as Oxaliplatin (P > 0.05). Treatments with the FFAE of KO, EPA and DHA (2:1 ratio) resulted in a significant increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the expression of active forms of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was significantly increased following the treatment of FFAE of KO. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has demonstrated that the anti-proliferative effects of krill oil on CRC cells are comparable with that of Oxaliplatin, and its anti-proliferative property is associated with the activation of caspase 3/9 in the CRC cells."

Krill oil treatment decreased the expression of truncated dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoproteins and proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway. In addition, the concentrations of dopamine were increased in the serum (p < 0.05) and brain (p > 0.05) due to the enhanced expressions of tyrosine-3-monooxygenase and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase. Moreover, krill oil alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis, decreased the abundance of bacteria that consume the precursor tyrosine, and increased the abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and short-chain fatty acid producers. This study revealed the beneficial effect of krill oil against d-gal-induced brain aging and clarified the underlying mechanism through proteomics and gut microbiota analysis.",

Observational studies have demonstrated an association between fish consumption (a source of LCPUFA) and cognition in adolescents, but intervention trials are lacking. The goal of the current study was to investigate the effect of one year of krill oil (a source of LCPUFA) supplementation on the cognitive performance of adolescents with a low Omega-3 Index (O3I ≤ 5%). A double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled supplementation trial with repeated measurements (baseline (T0), three months (T1), six months (T2), and 12 months (T3)) in adolescents (267 randomized) was executed. Participants were randomized to 400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day in Cohort I or placebo and 800 mg EPA + DHA per day in Cohort II or placebo. O3I was monitored by a finger prick at all time points. At T0, T2, and T3, participants executed a neurocognitive test battery. Covariate corrected mixed models were run with either condition (krill or placebo) or O3I as predictors. Krill oil supplementation led to a small but significant increase in mean O3I, but few participants increased to the intended O3I range (8-11%). There was no significant effect of supplementation on the neurocognitive tests, nor a relationship between O3I and neurocognitive test scores. The increase in O3I was small in most participants, probably due to non-compliance. Possibly the increase in O3I was too small to demonstrate an effect. More research on the influence of LCPUFAs on cognition in adolescents is needed.",

In this study, in the search for effective preventative treatments to be used in people subjected to reduced mobility, the effect of co-treatment with cotinine plus KO in mice subjected to prolonged RS was investigated. The results show that cotinine plus KO prevented the loss of astrocytes, the appearance of depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment induced by RS. The use of the combination of cotinine plus KO was more effective than cotinine alone in preventing the depressive-like behavior in the restrained mice. The potential use of this combination to alleviate the psychological effects of reduced mobility is discussed."

This study aimed to investigate how krill oil, a source of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with a high phosphatidylcholine content, affected these parameters. The pilot study was conducted as a 28 days intervention in 17 healthy volunteers (18-36 years), who received a supplement of 4.5 g krill oil per day, providing 833 mg ω-3 PUFAs, and 1750 mg phosphatidylcholine. Krill oil supplementation increased fasting plasma choline (+28.4%, p < .001), betaine (+26.6%, p < .001), dimethylglycine (+33.7%, p < .001) and sarcosine (+16.8%, p < .001), whereas no statistically significant changes were seen for plasma glycine, serine, methionine, total homocysteine, cysteine, cystathionine, methionine sulfoxide, folate, cobalamin, B2-, B3-, and B6 vitamers, tryptophan, kynurenines, nicotinamide, vitamin A and vitamin E. In summary, krill oil supplementation influenced choline metabolite levels, but not plasma metabolites of the tryptophan-kynurenine-nicotinamide pathways and vitamins. These observations should be confirmed in a placebo-controlled trial, including an ω-3 PUFA supplement without phospholipids to explore the potential additive effects of the different active ingredients.",

Krill oil is a source of marine n-3 fatty acids that has been shown to modulate gene expression in animal studies; however, the effect in humans is not known. Hence, we aimed to compare the effect of intake of krill oil, lean and fatty fish with a similar content of n-3 fatty acids, and high-oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) with added astaxanthin on the expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and inflammation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as circulating inflammatory markers. In an 8-week trial, healthy men and women aged 18-70 years with fasting TAG of 1·3-4·0 mmol/l were randomised to receive krill oil capsules (n 12), HOSO capsules (n 12) or lean and fatty fish (n 12). The weekly intakes of marine n-3 fatty acids from the interventions were 4654, 0 and 4103 mg, respectively. The mRNA expression of four genes, PPAR γ coactivator 1A (PPARGC1A), steaoryl-CoA desaturase (SCD), ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), were differently altered by the interventions. Furthermore, within-group analyses revealed that krill oil down-regulated the mRNA expression of thirteen genes, including genes involved in glucose and cholesterol metabolism and β-oxidation. Fish altered the mRNA expression of four genes and HOSO down-regulated sixteen genes, including several inflammation-related genes. There were no differences between the groups in circulating inflammatory markers after the intervention. In conclusion, the intake of krill oil and HOSO with added astaxanthin alter the PBMC mRNA expression of more genes than the intake of fish."

Cotinine facilitates fear memory extinction and reduces depressive-like behavior when administered 24 h after fear conditioning in mice. In this study, it was investigated the behavioral and molecular effects of cotinine, and other antidepressant preparations infused intranasally. Intranasal (IN) cotinine, IN krill oil, IN cotinine plus krill oil, and oral sertraline were evaluated on depressive-like behavior and fear retention and extinction after fear conditioning in C57BL/6 mice. Since calcineurin A has been involved in facilitating fear extinction in rodents, we also investigated changes of calcineurin in the hippocampus, a region key on contextual fear extinction. Short-term treatment with cotinine formulations was superior to krill oil and oral sertraline in reducing depressive-like behavior and fear consolidation and enhancing contextual fear memory extinction in mice. IN krill oil slowed the extinction of fear. IN cotinine preparations increased the levels of calcineurin A in the hippocampus of conditioned mice. In the light of the results, the future investigation of the use of IN cotinine preparations for the extinction of contextual fear memory and treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in PTSD is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Impaired glucose metabolism and mitochondrial decay greatly increase with age, when cognitive decline becomes rampant. No pharmacological or dietary intervention has proven effective, but proper diet and lifestyle do postpone the onset of neurodegeneration and some nutrients are being investigated. We studied insulin signaling, mitochondrial activity and biogenesis, and synaptic signaling in the hippocampus and cortex following dietary supplementation with bioactive phospholipid concentrates of krill oil (KOC), buttermilk fat globule membranes (BMFC), and a combination of both in aged rats. After 3 months of supplementation, although all groups of animals showed clear signs of peripheral insulin resistance, the combination of KOC and BMFC was able to improve peripheral insulin sensitivity. We also explored brain energy balance. Interestingly, the hippocampus of supplemented rats-mainly when supplemented with BMFC or the combination of KOC and BMFC-showed an increase in intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, whereas no difference was observed in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, we found a significant increase of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of BMFC+KO animals. In summary, dietary supplementation with KOC and/or BMFC improves peripheral and central insulin resistance, suggesting that their administration could delay the onset of these phenomena. Moreover, n-3 fatty acids (FAs) ingested as phospholipids increase BDNF levels favoring an improvement in energy state within neurons and facilitating both mitochondrial and protein synthesis, which are necessary for synaptic plasticity. Thus, dietary supplementation with n-3 FAs could protect local protein synthesis and energy balance within dendrites, favoring neuronal health and delaying cognitive decline associated to age-related disrepair.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, and oxidative stress plays a vital role in its progression. Antarctic krill oil (AKO) is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which has various biological activities, such as improving insulin sensitivity, alleviating inflammation and ameliorating oxidative stress. In this study, the protective effect of AKO against AD were investigated in senescence-accelerated prone mouse strain 8 (SAMP8) mice. Results showed that treatment with AKO could effectively ameliorate learning and memory deficits and ease the anxiety in SAMP8 mice by Morris water maze, Barnes maze test and open-field test. Further analysis indicated that AKO might reduce β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in hippocampus through decreasing the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G), increasing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in the brain of SAMP8 mice. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results of Morris water maze, Barnes maze test and open-field test indicated that Antarctic krill oil (AKO) improved the cognitive function and anxiety of SAMP8 mice. AKO reduced the Aβ42 level in hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. AKO ameliorated oxidative stress in brain rather than in serum and liver of SAMP8 mice.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are implicated in the development and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of krill oil. Oil from Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill), an Antarctic marine species, is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We examined whether krill oil diet (80 mg/kg/day for one month) prevents amyloidogenesis and cognitive impairment induced by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (250 µg/kg, seven times daily) injections in AD mice model and found that krill oil treatment inhibited the LPS-induced memory loss. We also found that krill oil treatment inhibited the LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde levels. Krill oil also suppresses IκB degradation as well as p50 and p65 translocation into the nuclei of LPS-injected mice brain cells. In association with the inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, krill oil suppressed amyloid beta (1-42) peptide generation by the down-regulating APP and BACE1 expression in vivo. We found that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (50 and 100 µM) dose-dependently decreased LPS-induced nitric oxide and ROS generation, and COX-2 and iNOS expression as well as nuclear factor-κB activity in cultured microglial BV-2 cells. These results suggest that krill oil ameliorated impairment via anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-amyloidogenic mechanisms.",

Feces may not represent all microbial communities in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Therefore, in this study, the stored ileal and colon samples collected from LD and HD groups were sequenced, and the location-specific modulations of microbial communities were observed after krill oil treatments. The 16S rRNA sequencing of the ileal samples showed that the LD and HD groups have similar patterns between control and high-fat diet (HFD) treatments, and six most abundant genera and 40 operational taxonomic units that respond to krill oil treatment were identified. However, the 16S rRNA sequencing of the colon samples showed that LD krill oil shifts the structure from the HFD to that of the control, whereas the HD group was distributed between the control and HFD groups. The corresponding most abundant genera and responsive OTUs totaled 4 and 45, respectively. In conclusion, different gastrointestinal tract locations contain different microbial communities.

Previous studies have confirmed that krill oil can alleviate hyperlipidemia, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To discern whether krill oil changes the structure of the gut microbiota during the hyperlipidemia treatment, 72 mice were acclimatized with a standard chow diet for 2 weeks and then randomly allocated to receive a standard chow diet (control group, n = 12) or a high-sugar-high-fat (HSHF) diet supplemented with a low (100 μg/g·d, HSHF+LD group, n = 12), moderate (200 μg/g·d, HSHF+MD group, n = 12) or high dosage of krill oil (600 μg/g·d, HSHF+HD group, n = 12), simvastatin (HSHF+S group, n = 12) or saline (HSHF group, n = 12) continuously for 12 weeks. The resulting weight gains were attenuated, the liver index and the low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations showed a stepwise reduction in the treated groups compared with those of the control group. A dose-dependent modulation of the gut microbiota was observed after treatment with krill oil. Low- and moderate- doses of krill oil increased the similarity between the composition of the HSHF diet-induced gut microbiota and that of the control, whereas the mice fed the high-dose exhibited a unique gut microbiota structure that was different from that of the control and HSHF groups. Sixty-five key operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that responded to the krill oil treatment were identified using redundancy analysis, of which 26 OTUs were increased and 39 OTUs were decreased compared with those of the HSHF group. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study suggest that the structural alterations in the gut microbiota induced by krill oil treatment were dose-dependent and associated with the alleviation of hyperlipidemia. Additionally, the high-dose krill oil treatment showed combined effects on the alleviation of hyperlipidemia and obesity."

STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials that investigated the impact of at least 2 weeks of supplementation with krill oil on plasma/serum concentrations of at least one of the main lipid parameters (ie, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides) and that reported sufficient information on plasma/serum lipid levels at baseline and at the end of study in both krill oil and control groups were eligible for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted the following data: first author's name, year of publication, study location, study design, number of participants in the krill oil and control groups, dosage of krill oil, type of control allocation, treatment duration, demographic characteristics of study participants, and baseline and follow-up plasma concentrations of lipids. Effect size was expressed as the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: Meta-analysis of data from 7 eligible trials (14 treatment arms) with 662 participants showed a significant reduction in plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD, -15.52 mg/dL; 95%CI, -28.43 to -2.61; P = 0.018) and triglycerides (WMD, -14.03 mg/dL; 95%CI, -21.38 to -6.67; P < 0.001) following supplementation with krill oil. A significant elevation in plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was also observed (WMD, 6.65 mg/dL; 95%CI, 2.30 to 10.99; P = 0.003), while a reduction in plasma concentrations of total cholesterol did not reach statistical significance (WMD, -7.50 mg/dL; 95%CI, -17.94 to 2.93; P = 0.159). CONCLUSION: Krill oil supplementation can reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Additional clinical studies with more participants are needed to assess the impact of krill oil supplementation on other indices of cardiometabolic risk and on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parenteral nutrition is often a mandatory therapeutic strategy for cases of septicemia. Likewise, therapeutic application of anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory therapy, and endotoxin lowering, by removal or inactivation, might be beneficial to ameliorate the systemic inflammatory response during the acute phases of critical illness. Concerning anti-inflammatory properties in this setting, omega-3 fatty acids of marine origin have been frequently described. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory and LPS-inactivating properties of krill oil (KO)-in-water emulsion in human macrophages in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were activated using specific ultrapure-LPS that binds only on the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in order to determine the inhibitory properties of the KO emulsion on the LPS-binding capacity, and the subsequent release of TNF-α. RESULTS: KO emulsion inhibited the macrophage binding of LPS to the TLR4 by 50% (at 12.5 µg/mL) and 75% (at 25 µg/mL), whereas, at 50 µg/mL, completely abolished the LPS binding. Moreover, KO (12.5 µg/mL, 25 µg/mL, or 50 µg/mL) also inhibited (30%, 40%, or 75%, respectively) the TNF-α release after activation with 0.01 µg/mL LPS in comparison with LPS treatment alone. CONCLUSION: KO emulsion influences the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages, possibly due to inactivation of the LPS binding capacity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A commonly used measure to reflect the intake of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA is the omega-3 index, defined as the sum of EPA + DHA as % of total fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane. When the omega-3 index changes it follows that the relative fractions of other fatty acids in the membrane are also changed. In the present study, increasing doses of a preparation of omega-3 rich phospholipids extracted from krill oil were administered orally to non-human primates for 12 weeks and the time course of EPA, DHA and 22 other fatty acids in erythrocytes was determined bi-weekly during treatment and for 8 weeks after cessation of treatment. Plasma concentrations of six endocannabinoid-type mediators being downstream metabolites of some fatty acids analyzed in erythrocytes were also determined. METHODS: Six diabetic, dyslipidemic non-human primates were included, three in a vehicle control group and three being treated with the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation. The vehicle control and test items were given daily by gavage and the test item doses were 50, 150 and 450 mg phospholipids/kg/day. Each dose level was given for four weeks. Blood was sampled at baseline and thereafter bi-weekly. Fatty acids were determined in erythrocytes by methylation followed by gas-chromatography. Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators were analyzed in plasma by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The treatment resulted in a dose-related increase in the fraction of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte membranes and a dose-related decrease of other poly-unsaturated fatty acids, in particular omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Erythrocyte concentrations of saturated fatty acids remained unchanged throughout the experiment. Plasma concentrations of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators changed accordingly as those being downstream arachidonic acid decreased, downstream of the saturated palmitic and oleic acids remained unchanged while a downstream EPA metabolite increased. CONCLUSION: Increasing the omega-3 index by administering an omega-3 rich phospholipid extracted from krill oil did not alter the ratio of unsaturated vs. saturated fatty acids in the erythrocyte membranes but only the relative concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids, in particular unsaturated omega-6 fatty acids. Concentrations of saturated fatty acids remained unchanged.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High serum levels of cholesterol, in particular low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are considered a significant risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, rigorous treatment regimens with statins and other pharmaceuticals have been used extensively to reduce elevated cholesterol levels. Literature data have not clearly concluded whether long-chain omega-3 fatty acids reduce, increase or leave circulating cholesterol unaffected. In the present study a novel krill-oil derived preparation of omega-3 rich phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine, was administered orally at increasing doses for 12 weeks to dyslipidemic non-human primates, and cholesterols and several other risk factors for cardiovascular disease were measured before, during and after treatment. METHODS: Six dyslipidemic non-human primates suffering from naturally occurring diabetes type-2 were included, three in a vehicle control group and three being treated with the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation. The control and test items were given daily by gavage and the doses of the test item were 50, 150 and 450 mg phospholipids/kg/day. Each dose level was given for 4 weeks. Plasma concentrations of the omega-3 fatty acids were measured in connection with change in dose and the omega-3 index in erythrocytes was determined bi-weekly. Blood lipids, apolipoproteins and diabetes, inflammatory and safety biomarkers were determined either weekly, biweekly or every 4 weeks. For the blood lipids and apolipoproteins, control-adjusted mean values are presented while absolute values are presented for the other parameters. Due to the low number of animals in each group, no statistical analyses were done. RESULTS: The only detectable effects measured during dosing with the lowest dose were an increase in HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. The intermediate and high doses decreased total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B100 and triglycerides and increased HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. No effects were seen on the diabetes and inflammatory markers and on safety biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation had a positive impact on cardiovascular disease risk factors by reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol. These findings justify further investigations of this preparation in animal models of dyslipidemia and, provided the current findings are confirmed, in human trials.",

The administration of krill oil is reported to mitigate inflammation in patients with cardiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoarthritis. However, the effect of krill oil on mild knee pain has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of krill oil on mild knee pain. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial of fifty adults (38-85 years old) with mild knee pain attending the Fukushima Orthopedic Clinic (Tochigi, Japan) between September 2014 and March 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive 2 g per day of either krill oil or an identical placebo for 30 days. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was improvement in subjective symptoms of knee pain as assessed by the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA). Secondary outcomes included blood and urine biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Both the placebo and krill oil groups showed significant improvements in the questions in the JKOM and JOA questionnaires after administration. After the intervention, krill oil group showed more improvements than placebo group in two questions regarding the pain and stiffness in knees in JKOM. Controlling for age, sex, weight, and smoking and drinking habits, krill oil significantly mitigated knee pain in sleeping (P < 0.001), standing (P < 0.001) and the range of motion of both right and left knees (both P = 0.011) compared to placebo. Krill oil administration raised plasma EPA (P = 0.048) and EPA/AA ratio (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that krill oil administration (2 g/day, 30 days) improved the subjective symptoms of knee pain in adults with mild knee pain.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world. The current available treatments for CRC include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, surgery is only useful when the disease is diagnosed at the earlier stage. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with numerous side effects that decrease the patients' quality of life. Safer, effective alternatives, such as natural compounds, to chemotherapy are desirable. This study assessed the efficacy of free fatty acid (FFA) extract of krill oil on three human CRC cells lines. METHODS: HCT-15, SW-480 and Caco-2 cells were treated with the FFA extracts of krill oil and fish oil for 48 h while treatments with the bioactive omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) of these marine oils, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) in comparison with a n-6 PUFA, arachnoid acid (AA, C20:4n-6) were up to 72 h at the concentrations of 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM. Effects of all the treatments on cell proliferation were assessed using a water-soluble tetrazolium-1 (WST-1) assay kit at 24, 48 and 72 h. Effects of FFA extract of krill oil and EPA on apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined using commercial kits after 48 h of treatment. RESULTS: Krill oil extract inhibited cell proliferation of all three cell lines in the similar manner as fish oil extract. A significant cell apoptosis and increase in mitochondrial membrane potential were observed after the treatment with krill oil extract. EPA at the concentration of 200 μM reduced significantly the proliferation of HCT-15 and SW-480 at 24, 48 and 72 h. In addition, EPA treatment (100 and 200 μM) resulted in significant cell apoptosis in all three cell lines. No significant changes were observed after treatment with DHA and AA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the FFA extract of krill oil maybe an effective chemotherapeutic agent to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in CRC cells through its bioactive constitute EPA. Although the exact mechanism of the pro-apoptotic properties of krill oil extract is unclear, mitochondrial pathway seems to be implicated.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The influence of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation on brain functioning is debated. Some studies have found positive effects on cognition in children with learning difficulties, elderly people with cognitive impairment and depression scores in depressed individuals. Other studies have found null or negative effects. Observational studies in adolescents have found positive associations between fish consumption (containing n-3 LCPUFAs) and academic achievement. However, intervention studies in typically developing adolescents are missing. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to determine the influence of increasing Omega-3 Index on cognitive functioning, academic achievement and mental well-being of typically developing adolescents. METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS: Double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled intervention; 264 adolescents (age 13-15 years) attending lower general secondary education started daily supplementation of 400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) in cohort I (n=130) and 800 mg EPA+DHA in cohort II (n=134) or a placebo for 52 weeks. Recruitment took place according to a low Omega-3 Index (<5%). The Omega-3 Index was monitored via a finger prick at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months. The supplement dose was adjusted after 3 months (placebo analogously) to reach an Omega-3 Index of 8-11%. At baseline, 6 and 12 months, a neuropsychological test battery, a number of questionnaires and a standardised math test (baseline and 12 months) were administered. School grades were collected. In a subsample, sleep quality and quantity data (n=64) and/or eye-tracking data (n=33) were collected. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Food2Learn is performed according to Good Clinical Practice. All data collected are linked to participant number only. The results will be disseminated on group level to participants and schools. The results will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. The study is approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Atrium-Orbis-Zuyd Hospital and is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR4082).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from different sources could have different lipid-lowering effects in humans. The main aim of our study was to compare the short-term triglyceride-lowering efficacy of krill oil and purified omega 3 ethyl ester PUFAs in mildly overweight hypertriglyceridemic subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomized clinical trial was carried out in 25 moderately hypertriglyceridemic subjects (TG = 150-500 mg/dl). After a 4-week run-in, participants were allocated to treatment with similar pills containing omega 3 ethyl ester PUFAs 1000 mg twice a day vs. krill oil 500 mg twice a day. After 4 weeks of treatment, participants were asked to observe a 4-week wash-out period, and they were then assigned to the alternative treatment for a further period of 4 weeks. RESULTS: Although both PUFA sources were able to improve TG plasma levels, esterified omega 3 PUFAs were more efficacious than krill oil (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, only krill oil treatment was able to significantly improve high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels, compared to both baseline (p < 0.05) and end of treatment with esterified omega 3 PUFAs (p < 0.05) values. Both treatments were able to significantly reduce high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels from the baseline (p < 0.05), but krill oil improved it more efficaciously than esterified omega 3 PUFAs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Krill oil has lipid-lowering effects comparable with those obtained through a 4-fold higher dose of purified omega 3 ethyl ester PUFAs in mildly overweight hypertriglyceridemic subjects, while more efficaciously reducing hs-CRP."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lipid abnormalities, enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress seem to represent a vicious circle in atherogenesis, and therapeutic options directed against these processes seems like a reasonable approach in the management of atherosclerotic disorders. Krill oil (RIMFROST Sublime®) is a phospholipid-rich oil with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratio of 1.8:1. In this pilot study we determined if krill oil could favourable affect plasma lipid parameters and parameters involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. METHODS: The study was conducted as a 28 days intervention study examining effect-parameters of dietary supplementation with krill oil (832.5 mg EPA and DHA per day). 17 healthy volunteers in the age group 18-36 (mean age 23 ± 4 years) participated. Plasma lipids, lipoprotein particle sizes, fatty acid composition in plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), plasma cytokines, antioxidant capacity, acylcarntines, carnitine, choline, betaine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were measured before and after supplementation. RESULTS: Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and large very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) & chylomicron particle concentrations decreased after 28 days of krill oil intake. A significant reduction in the TAG/HDL cholesterol resulted. Krill oil supplementation decreased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio both in plasma and RBCs. This was due to increased EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and reduced amount of arachidonic acid (AA). The increase of n-3 fatty acids and wt % of EPA and DHA in RBC was of smaller magnitude than found in plasma. Krill oil intake increased the antioxidant capacity, double bond index (DBI) and the fatty acid anti-inflammatory index. The plasma atherogenicity index remained constant whereas the thrombogenicity index decreased. Plasma choline, betaine and the carnitine precursor, γ-butyrobetaine were increased after krill oil supplementation whereas the TMAO and carnitine concentrations remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Krill oil consumption is considered health beneficial as it decreases cardiovascular disease risk parameters through effects on plasma TAGs, lipoprotein particles, fatty acid profile, redox status and possible inflammation. Noteworthy, no adverse effects on plasma levels of TMAO and carnitine were found.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind controlled cross-over trial was employed. Outcomes assessed were: endothelial function, blood lipids, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, serum antioxidant level, C peptide, and calculated Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) scores. Participants were randomized to either krill oil or olive oil supplementation for 4 weeks, underwent a 2-week washout period, and then crossed to the other supplementation for 4 weeks. All participants were then offered an additional 17 weeks of krill supplementation. Testing occurred at 3 time points: baseline, after first supplementation, and after second supplementation. Testing also occurred after an optional 17 weeks of krill oil supplementation. Difference scores were calculated for each participant in both sequences (ie, differences in outcome measures in the first and second period of the sequence). The mean and SD of the scores in the 2 sequence groups were used to test for differences between treatment effects at a significance level of p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 47 participants were included in the initial cross-over study. Participants who received krill oil for 4 weeks had an improvement in their endothelial function and a reduction in blood C peptide levels and HOMA scores as compared with the olive oil. A total of 34 participants completed the additional 17-week supplementation period. When compared with their respective baseline measures, these participants had a statistically significant improvement in endothelial function and blood high-density lipoprotein (HDL). CONCLUSIONS: Krill oil may lead to moderate improvement of cardiovascular risks, specifically endothelial dysfunction and HDL in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Furthermore, we discuss the findings in relation to the possible different health effects, focusing on lipids, inflammatory markers, cardiovascular disease risk, and biological functions of these two sources of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed in January 2015. In total, 113 articles were identified, but based on selection criteria, 14 original papers were included in the review. RESULTS: Studies on bioavailability of EPA and DHA from KO and FO in humans and animals are limited and the interpretation is difficult, as different amounts of EPA and DHA have been used, duration of intervention differs, and different study groups have been included. Two human studies--one postprandial study and one intervention study--used the same amount of EPA and DHA from KO or FO, and they both showed that the bioavailability of EPA and DHA from KO seems to be higher than that from FO. Limited effects of KO and FO on lipids and inflammatory markers in human and animal studies were reported. Gene expression data from animal studies showed that FO upregulated the cholesterol synthesis pathway, which was the opposite of the effect mediated by KO. KO also regulated far more metabolic pathways than FO, which may indicate different biological effects of KO and FO. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a difference in bioavailability of EPA and DHA after intake of KO and FO, but more studies are needed before a firm conclusion can be made. It is also necessary to document the beneficial health effects of KO with more human studies and to elucidate if these effects differ from those after regular fish and FO intake.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3-PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) provide multiple health benefits for heart, brain and eyes. However, consumption of fatty fish, the main source of LC n-3-PUFAs is low in Western countries. Intakes of LC n-3-PUFA can be increased by taking dietary supplements, such as fish oil, algal oil, or krill oil. Recently, conflicting information was published on the relative bioavailability of these omega-3 supplements. A few studies suggested that the phospholipid form (krill) is better absorbed than the fish oil ethyl ester (EE) or triglyceride (TG) forms. Yet studies did not match the doses administered nor the concentrations of DHA and EPA per supplement across such comparisons, leading to questionable conclusions. This study was designed to compare the oral bioavailability of the same dose of both EPA and DHA in fish oil-EE vs. fish oil-TG vs. krill oil in plasma at the end of a four-week supplementation. METHODS: Sixty-six healthy adults (n = 22/arm) were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, three-treatment, multi-dose, parallel study. Subjects were supplemented with a 1.3 g/d dose of EPA + DHA (approximately 816 mg/d EPA + 522 mg/d DHA, regardless of formulation) for 28 consecutive days, as either fish oil-EE, fish oil-TG or krill oil capsules (6 caps/day). Plasma and red blood cell (RBC) samples were collected at baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) and at 4, 8, 12, 48, 72, 336, and 672 h. Total plasma EPA + DHA levels at Week 4 (Hour 672) were measured as the primary endpoint. RESULTS: No significant differences in total plasma EPA + DHA at 672 h were observed between fish oil-EE (mean = 90.9 ± 41 ug/mL), fish oil-TG (mean = 108 ± 40 ug/mL), and krill oil (mean = 118.5 ± 48 ug/mL), p = 0.052 and bioavailability differed by < 24 % between the groups. Additionally, DHA + EPA levels were not significantly different in RBCs among the 3 formulations, p = 0.19, providing comparable omega-3 indexes. CONCLUSIONS: Similar plasma and RBC levels of EPA + DHA were achieved across fish oil and krill oil products when matched for dose, EPA, and DHA concentrations in this four week study, indicating comparable oral bioavailability irrespective of formulation.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a neoplastic condition afflicting mostly the young, as the lesion usually occurs in areas of bone growth with tumour cells metastasising to the lungs in advanced disease. There is no real cure for the disease, with conventional drugs causing side-effects that decrease the quality of life of sufferers. Newer and safer drugs are needed, and one avenue is to use natural compounds that can stunt the growth of the tumour. OBJECTIVE: In this study, two such biological entities were evaluated: krill oil and fish oil. Human OS cells were exposed to krill oil, fish oil, EPA and DHA in time-course assays lasting up to 72h. RESULTS: Krill oil inhibited 23, 50 and 64% of cell proliferation at 24, 48 and 72h respectively, while fish oil resulted in no significant changes although an increase was observed at 24h. Interestingly EPA and DHA promoted OS cell proliferation and migration in this neoplasia. The inhibitory effect of krill oil was comparable to 0.5 and 1µM doxorubicin, a commonly used clinical drug for OS treatment. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that krill oil may be used in combination with standard clinical practices to control primary tumour growth, and more importantly, metastasis.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of fish oil (FO) and krill oil (KO) supplementation on glucose tolerance in obese New Zealand white rabbits. METHODS: The experiments were carried out with 24 male rabbits randomly divided into four groups: KO-castrated, treated with KO; FO-castrated, treated with FO; C-castrated, non-treated; NC-non-castrated, non-treated. At the end of treatment period (2 months), an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed in all rabbits. RESULTS: Fasting blood glucose concentrations in FO and KO animals were significantly lower than in group C. The blood glucose concentrations in FO- and KO-treated animals returned to initial values after 30 and 60 min of IVGTT, respectively. In liver, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2) genes were significantly increased in FO-fed rabbits compared with the C group. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (Acaca) expression was significantly reduced in both KO- and FO-fed rabbits. In skeletal muscle, Hmgcs2 and Cd36 were significantly higher in KO-fed rabbits compared with the C group. Acaca expression was significantly lower in KO- and FO-fed rabbits compared with the C group. CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that FO and KO supplementation decreases fasting blood glucose and improves glucose tolerance in obese New Zealand white rabbits. This could be ascribed to the ameliorated insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion and modified gene expressions of some key enzymes involved in β-oxidation and lipogenesis in liver and skeletal muscle.",

      "abstract": "Marine oils rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been recommended as a preventive treatment for patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases. These oils also are the third most consumed dietary supplement in the USA. However, evidence for their health benefits is equivocal. We tested the daily, isocaloric administration of krill oil (1.17 g oil/kg diet) and Lovaza (Omacor; 4.40 g/kg diet), a pharmaceutical grade fish oil, beginning at 12 months of age, on the life span and mortality-related pathologies of long-lived, male, B6C3F1 mice. The oils were incorporated into the chemically defined American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93 M diet. An equivalent volume of soybean oil was removed. Krill oil was 3 % and Lovaza 11 % of the oil in the diets. When their effects were analyzed together, the marine oils significantly shortened life span by 6.6 % (P = 0.0321; log-rank test) relative to controls. Individually, Lovaza and krill oil non-significantly shortened median life span by 9.8 and 4.7 %, respectively. Lovaza increased the number of enlarged seminal vesicles (7.1-fold). Lovaza and krill oil significantly increased lung tumors (4.1- and 8.2-fold) and hemorrhagic diathesis (3.9- and 3.1-fold). Analysis of serum from treated mice found that Lovaza slightly increased blood urea nitrogen, while krill oil modestly increased bilirubin, triglycerides, and blood glucose levels. Taken together, the results do not support the idea that the consumption of isolated ω-3 fatty acid-rich oils will increase the life span or health of initially healthy individuals.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of marine fishes and general seafood has long been recommended by several medical authorities as a long-term nutritional intervention to preserve mental health, hinder neurodegenerative processes, and sustain cognitive capacities in humans. Most of the neurological benefits provided by frequent seafood consumption comes from adequate uptake of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, n-3/n-6 PUFAs, and antioxidants. Optimal n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratios allow efficient inflammatory responses that prevent the initiation and progression of many neurological disorders. Moreover, interesting in vivo and clinical studies with the marine antioxidant carotenoid astaxanthin (present in salmon, shrimp, and lobster) have shown promising results against free radical-promoted neurodegenerative processes and cognition loss. This review presents the state-of-the-art applications of n-3/n-6 PUFAs and astaxanthin as nutraceuticals against neurodegenerative diseases associated with exacerbated oxidative stress in CNS. The fundamental \"neurohormesis\" principle is discussed throughout this paper. Finally, new perspectives for the application of a natural combination of the aforementioned anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents (found in krill oil) are also presented herewith.",

We hypothesized that Krill oil lowers serum TG levels in subjects with borderline high or high fasting TG levels. To test our hypothesis 300 male and female subjects were included in a double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study with five treatment groups: placebo (olive oil) or 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 g/day of krill oil. Serum lipids were measured after an overnight fast at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Due to a high intra-individual variability in TG levels, data from all subjects in the four krill oil groups were pooled to increase statistical power, and a general time- and dose-independent one-way analysis of variance was performed to assess efficacy. Relative to subjects in the placebo group, those administered krill oil had a statistically significant calculated reduction in serum TG levels of 10.2%. Moreover, LDL-C levels were not increased in the krill oil groups relative to the placebo group. The outcome of the pooled analysis suggests that krill oil is effective in reducing a cardiovascular risk factor. However, owing to the individual fluctuations of TG concentrations measured, a study with more individual measurements per treatment group is needed to increase the confidence of these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to structural differences, bioavailability of krill oil, a phospholipid based oil, could be higher than fish oil, a triglyceride-based oil, conferring properties that render it more effective than fish oil in increasing omega-3 index and thereby, reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the effects of krill oil compared with fish oil or a placebo control on plasma and red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid profile in healthy volunteers. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Twenty four healthy volunteers were recruited for a double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The study consisted of three treatment phases including krill or fish oil each providing 600 mg of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) or placebo control, corn oil in capsule form. Each treatment lasted 4 wk and was separated by 8 wk washout phases. RESULTS: Krill oil consumption increased plasma (p = 0.0043) and RBC (p = 0.0011) n-3 PUFA concentrations, including EPA and DHA, and reduced n-6:n-3 PUFA ratios (plasma: p = 0.0043, RBC: p = 0.0143) compared with fish oil consumption. Sum of EPA and DHA concentrations in RBC, the omega-3 index, was increased following krill oil supplementation compared with fish oil (p = 0.0143) and control (p < 0.0001). Serum triglycerides and HDL cholesterol concentrations did not change with any of the treatments. However, total and LDL cholesterol concentrations were increased following krill (TC: p = 0.0067, LDL: p = 0.0143) and fish oil supplementation (TC: p = 0.0028, LDL: p = 0.0143) compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of krill oil was well tolerated with no adverse events. Results indicate that krill oil could be more effective than fish oil in increasing n-3 PUFA, reducing n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio, and improving the omega-3 index.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Krill oil, rich in n-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) incorporated in phosphatidylcholine, has been reported to have many effects on physiological function. However, there are few studies using psychophysiological methods published that describe the effects of krill oil on brain function. We investigated the influence of ingestion of krill oil on cognitive function in elderly subjects by using near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalography. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparative study design was adopted. Forty-five healthy elderly males aged 61-72 years were assigned to receive 12 weeks of treatment with: medium-chain triglycerides as placebo; krill oil, which is rich in n-3 PUFAs incorporated in phosphatidylcholine; or sardine oil, which is abundant in n-3 PUFAs incorporated in triglycerides. Changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the cerebral cortex during memory and calculation tasks were measured. The P300 component of event-related potentials was also measured during a working memory task. RESULTS: During the working memory task, changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the krill oil and sardine oil groups were significantly greater than those in the medium-chain triglyceride group at week 12. The differential value for P300 latency in the krill oil group was significantly lower than that in the medium-chain triglyceride group at week 12. With regard to the calculation task, changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the krill oil group were significantly greater than those in the medium-chain triglyceride group at week 12. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that n-3 PUFAs activate cognitive function in the elderly. This is especially the case with krill oil, in which the majority of n-3 PUFAs are incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, causing it to be more effective than sardine oil, in which n-3 PUFAs are present as triglycerides.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Biological effects of marine oils, fish oil (FO) and krill oil (KO), are mostly attributed to the high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), predominantly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The study was aimed to investigate the influence of FO and KO on lipid homeostasis and inflammation in an animal model of persistent low-grade exposure to human tumor necrosis factor α (hTNF-α) and to evaluate whether these effects depend on the structural forms of EPA and DHA [triacylglycerols (TAG) vs. phospholipids]. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 hTNF-α mice were fed for 6 weeks a high-fat control diet (24.50 % total fats, w/w) or high-fat diets containing either FO or KO at similar doses of n-3 PUFAs (EPA: 5.23 vs. 5.39 wt%, DHA: 2.82 vs. 2.36 wt% of total fatty acids). RESULTS: We found that KO, containing bioactive n-3 PUFAs in the form of phospholipids, was capable of modulating lipid metabolism by lowering plasma levels of TAG and cholesterol and stimulating the mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as improving the overall carnitine turnover. Though the administration of FO was not as effective as KO in the lowering of plasma TAG, FO significantly improved the levels of all cholesterol classes in plasma. Except from the increase in the levels of IL-17 in FO-fed mice and a trend to decrease in MCP-1 levels in KO-fed animals, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were not substantially different between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that FO and KO are comparable dietary sources of n-3 PUFAs. However, when quantitatively similar doses of n-3 PUFAs are administered, KO seems to have a greater potential to promote lipid catabolism. The effect of dietary oils on the levels of inflammatory markers in hTNF-α transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet needs further investigations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the western world, heart failure (HF) is one of the most important causes of cardiovascular mortality. Supplement with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been shown to improve cardiac function in HF and to decrease mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). The molecular structure and composition of n-3 PUFA varies between different marine sources and this may be of importance for their biological effects. Krill oil, unlike fish oil supplements, contains the major part of the n-3 PUFA in the form of phospholipids. This study investigated effects of krill oil on cardiac remodeling after experimental MI. Rats were randomised to pre-treatment with krill oil or control feed 14 days before induction of MI. Seven days post-MI, the rats were examined with echocardiography and rats in the control group were further randomised to continued control feed or krill oil feed for 7 weeks before re-examination with echocardiography and euthanization. RESULTS: The echocardiographic evaluation showed significant attenuation of LV dilatation in the group pretreated with krill oil compared to controls. Attenuated heart weight, lung weight, and levels of mRNA encoding classical markers of LV stress, matrix remodeling and inflammation reflected these findings. The total composition of fatty acids were examined in the left ventricular (LV) tissue and all rats treated with krill oil showed a significantly higher proportion of n-3 PUFA in the LV tissue, although no difference was seen between the two krill oil groups. CONCLUSIONS: Supplement with krill oil leads to a proportional increase of n-3 PUFA in myocardial tissue and supplement given before induction of MI attenuates LV remodeling.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the efficacy of standard fish oil has been the subject of research in arthritis, the effect of krill oil in this disease has yet to be investigated. The objective of the present study was to evaluate a standardised preparation of krill oil and fish oil in an animal model for arthritis. METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis susceptible DBA/1 mice were provided ad libitum access to a control diet or diets supplemented with either krill oil or fish oil throughout the study. There were 14 mice in each of the 3 treatment groups. The level of EPA + DHA was 0.44 g/100 g in the krill oil diet and 0.47 g/100 g in the fish oil diet. Severity of arthritis was determined using a clinical scoring system. Arthritis joints were analysed by histopathology and graded. Serum samples were obtained at the end of the study and the levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17 and TGF-beta were determined by a Luminex assay system. RESULTS: Consumption of krill oil and supplemented diet significantly reduced the arthritis scores and hind paw swelling when compared to a control diet not supplemented with EPA and DHA. However, the arthritis score during the late phase of the study was only significantly reduced after krill oil administration. Furthermore, mice fed the krill oil diet demonstrated lower infiltration of inflammatory cells into the joint and synovial layer hyperplasia, when compared to control. Inclusion of fish oil and krill oil in the diets led to a significant reduction in hyperplasia and total histology score. Krill oil did not modulate the levels of serum cytokines whereas consumption of fish oil increased the levels of IL-1alpha and IL-13. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that krill oil may be a useful intervention strategy against the clinical and histopathological signs of inflammatory arthritis.",

This article evaluated effects of krill oil (KO) on serum lipids of hyperlipidemia rats and human colon cancer cells (SW480). Serum lipids of rats fed with high fat diet (HFD) and different doses of KO were measured by automatic analyzer. Effect of KO on viability of cells was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. RESULTS: Except for higher dose group, body weights decreased significantly. Total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) of all dose groups, Triglycerides (TG) of low and mid dose groups descended significantly, while there were no significant differences of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), compared with control group. Treatment of colon cancer cells with KO also resulted in time-dependent inhibition of cell growth. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that the consumption of KO may provide benefits to control serum lipid levels in certain diseases and inhibit growth of colon cancer cells. Therefore, KO may be a good candidate for development as a functional food and nutraceutical.",

METHODS: Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Ninety patients were recruited with confirmed diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and/or rheumatoid arthritis and/or osteoarthritis and with increased levels of CRP (>1.0 mg/dl) upon three consecutive weekly blood analysis. Group A received NKO (300 mg daily) and Group B received a placebo. CRP and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis score were measured at baseline and days 7, 14 and 30. RESULTS: After 7 days of treatment NKO reduced CRP by 19.3% compared to an increase by 15.7% observed in the placebo group (p = 0.049). After 14 and 30 days of treatment NKO further decreased CRP by 29.7% and 30.9% respectively (p < 0.001). The CRP levels of the placebo group increased to 32.1% after 14 days and then decreased to 25.1% at day 30. The between group difference was statistically significant; p = 0.004 at day 14 and p = 0.008 at day 30. NKO showed a significant reduction in all three WOMAC scores. After 7 days of treatment, NKO reduced pain scores by 28.9% (p = 0.050), reduced stiffness by 20.3% (p = 0.001) and reduced functional impairment by 22.8% (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study clearly indicate that NKO at a daily dose of 300 mg significantly inhibits inflammation and reduces arthritic symptoms within a short treatment period of 7 and 14 days.",

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of NKO for the management of premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea with that of omega-3 fish oil. METHODS/DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy patients of reproductive age diagnosed with premenstrual syndrome according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R). INTERVENTIONS: Treatment period of three months with either NKO or omega-3 fish oil. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-Assessment Questionnaire based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) diagnostic criteria for premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea and number of analgesics used for dysmenorrhea. RESULTS: In 70 patients with complete data, a statistically significant improvement was demonstrated among baseline, interim, and final evaluations in the self assessment questionnaire (P < 0.001) within the NKO group as well as between-group comparison to fish oil, after three cycles or 45 and 90 days of treatment. Data analysis showed a significant reduction of the number of analgesics used for dysmenorrhea within the NKO group (comparing baseline vs. 45- vs. 90-day visit). The between-groups analysis illustrated that women taking NKO consumed significantly fewer analgesics during the 10-day treatment period than women receiving omega-3 fish oil (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: Neptune Krill Oil can significantly reduce dysmenorrhea and the emotional symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and is shown to be significantly more effective for the complete management of premenstrual symptoms compared to omega-3 fish oil.",
