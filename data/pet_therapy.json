METHODS: The study was conducted with elderly individuals in a nursing home in Tokat province in Turkey. The study sample consisted of 59 elderly individuals, with 30 in the intervention group and 29 in the control group, who met the inclusion criteria. Pet therapy was applied to elderly individuals twice a week for 6 weeks for a total of 12 sessions as a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of pet therapy on sleep and life quality. While pet therapy was applied to the individuals in the intervention group, the control group was no pet theraphy. RESULTS: It was determined that the sleep and life quality of the individuals in the intervention group increased statistically and significantly. There was no statistically significant difference in the change in sleep and life quality of individuals in the control group. A statistically significant difference was determined between the intervention and control groups regarding sleep and life quality. CONCLUSION: Pet therapy was determined to significantly improve the sleep and life quality of elderly individuals living in a nursing home. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2025; 25: 356-365.",

This study aimed to determine the effects of pet therapy on the stress and social anxiety levels of physically disabled children. METHOD: This study was a single-blind randomized controlled experimental study with a pre-test, post-test and follow-up design. The study was carried out between November 2019 and September 2020 in two separate Special Education and Rehabilitation Centers with a total of 44 physically disabled children, 23 in the control and 21 in the intervention group, who met the inclusion criteria. The NCT number of this study is NCT04231799. The data of the study were obtained through Personal Information Form (PIF), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Social Anxiety in Children Scale-Revised Version (SACS-R) and blood pressure measurements. A pet therapy program was applied to the intervention group. Apart from the standard training given in the rehabilitation center, no intervention was made on the control group RESULTS: After the pet therapy program intervention, it was found that there was a decrease in the mean PSS and SACS-R scores of the children in the intervention group, and this decrease was significant compared to the individuals in the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: It was determined that the pet therapy program was an effective intervention in reducing the stress and social anxiety levels of the physically disabled children.",

Pet therapy has decreased anxiety in various hospitalized patient populations. The human-animal bond is the foundation for the positive interaction therapy dogs create. AIMS: This study's purpose was to explore the use of pet therapy as an intervention to decrease patients' anxiety levels on two diverse inpatient units: Behavioral Health (BHU) and Pediatrics (PEDS). METHODS: This was a quantitative study using a convenience sample, with systematic assignment to the experimental and control group. The State Anxiety Scale (SAS), a 6-item, Likert-type Short Form version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, was used with adults and children; a Pediatric Emoji Method was constructed to assist children with the SAS. After consent, both groups completed the SAS pretest. Intervention patients then spent up to 15 minutes with a therapy dog and handler. The SAS posttest was completed 1 hour later by the experimental and control group. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used, including an independent samples t test, paired-sample t test, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Findings revealed that the therapy dog visitations had a positive effect on lowering anxiety supporting the hypothesis. Both the PEDS and BHU participants experienced a significant decrease in their anxiety level following the dog visits. CONCLUSION: Patients on the BHU and PEDS units benefitted from their visit with a therapy dog by experiencing a decrease in their anxiety level.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pet therapy, or animal-assisted interventions (AAIs), has demonstrated positive effects for patients, families, and health care providers (HCPs) in inpatient settings. However, the evidence supporting AAIs in emergency or ambulatory care settings is unclear. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of AAIs on patient, family, and HCP experience in these settings. METHODS: We searched (from inception to May 2020) Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, plus gray literature, for studies assessing AAIs in emergency and ambulatory care settings on: (1) patient and family anxiety/distress or pain and (2) HCP stress. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were done in duplicate with conflicts adjudicated by a third party. Random-effects meta-analyses are reported as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), as appropriate. RESULTS: We included nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 341 patients, 146 HCPs, 122 child caregivers), four before-after (83 patients), and one mixed-method study (124 patients). There was no effect across three RCTs measuring patient-reported anxiety/distress (n = 380; SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.95 to 0.23, I2  = 81%), while two before-after studies suggested a benefit (n = 80; SMD = -1.95, 95% CI = -2.99 to -0.91, I2  = 72%). Four RCTs found no difference in measures of observed anxiety/distress (n = 166; SMD = -0.44, 95% CI = -1.01 to 0.13, I2  = 73%) while one before-after study reported a significant benefit (n = 60; SMD = -1.64, 95% CI = -2.23 to -1.05). Three RCTs found no difference in patient-reported pain (n = 202; MD = -0.90, 95% CI = -2.01 to 0.22, I2  = 68%). Two RCTs reported positive but nonsignificant effects on HCP stress. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of AAIs in emergency and ambulatory care settings. Rigorous studies using global experience-oriented (or patient-identified) outcome measures are required.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) are disturbances highly related to age. This means that, with the increasing trend in life expectancy, there is also an increase in this diagnosis, although NCDs are not exclusively found in the population over 65 years old. Likely, they will increase in the coming years together with improvements in diagnosis. In addition to the use of medicines and rehabilitative techniques, pet therapy is also used. Pet therapy makes use of animals with therapeutic, rehabilitative, educational, and recreational purposes for people affected by physical, neuromotor, and psychiatric disorders. Pet therapy seems to be functional for increasing social and communication competencies, facilitating verbal and body language, increasing self-esteem, improving quality of life, and reducing anxiety/stress. METHODS: This study was based on scientific papers and publications obtained from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Moreover, other articles from further cross-references were included. Specific database research criteria were (a) articles published in 2018 or later, (b) samples containing only adults over 65 years old, (c) written in English or Italian, and (d) on the topic of animal-assisted intervention. RESULTS: Uncertain results were obtained. Although a positive effect was found, the included articles were of insufficient methodological rigor. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Although many studies reported positive results, these could not be generalized because of the numerous biases present (e.g., small sample size, lack of methodological rigor, lack of protocol, etc.). Future studies, therefore, should seek to address the limitations found in the analyzed studies."

Dog therapy and ownership were found to improve mood, quality of life, and disease symptoms across multiple neurological disorders. It also encouraged physical activity which was shown to help many diseases studied, even ones associated with skeletal muscle apoptosis, such as Huntington's disease. Dog therapy and ownership are a safe and effective nonpharmaceutical approach to treating chronic and progressive neurological disorders."

      "abstract": "Therapy response assessment is a critical step in cancer management, leading clinicians to optimize the use of therapeutic options during the course of the disease. Imaging is a pivotal biomarker for therapy response evaluation in oncology and has gained wider use through the development of reproducible data-based guidelines, of which the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors is the most successful example. Disease-specific criteria have also been proposed, and the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria are the mainstay for prostate cancer (PC). However, conventional imaging evaluation in metastatic PC has several limitations, including (a) the inability to detect small-volume disease, (b) the high prevalence of bone (nonmeasurable) lesions at imaging, and (c) the established role of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as the biomarker of choice for response assessment and disease progression. In addition, there are an increasing number of newer treatment options with various effects on imaging features. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET has improved patient selection for newer treatments, such as metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) or radionuclide therapy. The role of PSMA PET in response assessment for many metastatic PC therapeutic options (MDT, androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy, radionuclide therapy, and immunotherapy) is an evolving issue, with emerging data showing good correlation with PSA levels and clinical outcome. However, there are specific implications of each therapy (especially androgen deprivation therapy and immunotherapy) on PSMA expression by PC cells, leading to potential pitfalls and inaccuracies that must be known by radiologists. Despite some limitations, PSMA PET is addressing gaps left by conventional imaging methods (eg, CT and bone scanning) and nonimaging biomarkers (PSA levels) in metastatic PC therapy response assessment, a role that can be improved with advances like refinement of interpretation criteria and whole-body tumor burden quantification.© RSNA, 2020See discussion on this article by Barwick and Castellucci.",

This quasi-experimental study compared state anxiety before and after structured research interventions in a convenience sample of children between the ages six and 17 (N = 93) in two groups. Participants were assigned to the pet therapy group or control group, based upon timing of data collection. Participants in each group received either a visit from the research assistant, therapy dog and handler, or from the research assistant for completion of a puzzle. The child's anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Scale for Children (STAIC) S-Anxiety Scale before and after the visit and parents completed a brief background questionnaire. Intervention and comparison groups had no significant differences in key demographic factors or baseline anxiety level. While state anxiety decreased significantly in both groups, children in the pet therapy group experienced a significantly greater decrease in anxiety (p = .004). In addition, parents reported high levels of satisfaction with the pet therapy program. Study findings provide support for a brief pet therapy visit with a trained dog and handler as a tool decrease to anxiety in hospitalized children while promoting parent satisfaction. When resources for providing pet therapy visits are limited, clinicians may consider prioritizing children who are most affected by anxiety.",

METHODS: 42 SSc patients, undergoing iloprost intravenous infusion, were divided in three groups: 1) 14 patients submitted to 20 AAI sessions; 2) 14 patients engaged in alternative social activity (control group 1 - C1); and 3) 14 patients without any alternative activity (control group 2 - C2). All patients underwent Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the State-anxiety (STAI-S) and emotional faces at the beginning (s0) and at the end (s1) of each single session, while General Anxiety State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R), the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), the Toronto Alexythymia Scale (TAS-20), the Thought Control Questionnaire (TCQ) were administered at baseline (t0) and at the end of the project (t1). RESULTS: AAI group showed a significant decrease of the anxiety state level in respect to the two control groups (p<0.001). VAS scale resulted lower both in AAI (p < 0.001) and C1 group (p<0.01). Moreover, STAI-T and TAS scores were significantly reduced in AAI group (p<0.001). TCQ scale showed that patients treated with AAI, compared to control group C2, had greater capacity to avoid unpleasant and unwanted thoughts (p<0.05). In AAI group, the EPQ-R test revealed an enhancement of extroversion trait compared to both control groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that AAI significantly reduces pain perception, anxiety, neuroticism and ameliorates patients' social interaction, therefore it may be a useful to allow a better compliance to traditional therapies.",

The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the efficacy of PT as a method for reducing physiological stress levels (blood pressure and heart rate) and subjective stress and anxiety scores (self-reported stress/anxiety). Further, we examined the effects of sample characteristics and modifications to the PT (different age groups and health status of participants across samples, whether a stressor was present, and individual versus group PT) as potential moderators of the relationship between PT and stress reactivity. Our searches incorporated articles published from May 2017 and earlier in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed. This meta-analysis included 28 articles with 34 independent samples and contained a total of 1,310 participants. Using a random effects model, we determined that significant differences occurred in heart rate, self-reported anxiety, and self-reported stress after PT exposure compared with before PT. However, we did not detect significant differences in blood pressure after PT. Sample characteristics and modifications to the PT significantly moderated the effect of PT on stress responses. Our results suggest that PT can be an effective program for reducing stress reactivity.",

      "abstract": "With the evolution of modern medical treatment strategies, there also comes the realization that many times we reach a point where traditional goals of medical care, such as overall survival or disease-free survival, are not realistic goals for many patients facing devastating illnesses. One such disease is malignant primary brain tumors, known as malignant glioma (MG). With median survival of only 20.9 months following best available standard of care treatment strategies, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and tumor treating fields, MG is one of the deadliest malignancies of the modern era. Along the course of treating patients with MG, clinicians often realize that traditional treatment therapies can at best provide incremental benefit of symptom management without any survival benefit. However, even in these difficult situations, it is possible to make significant positive changes in patients&rsquo; health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using creative, non-traditional interventions. In this paper, we describe the initial findings from our project that takes a unique approach to studying the intersections of clinical care and art by using pet therapy and art-making as interventions for patients diagnosed with brain tumors. Our preliminary findings suggest that pet therapy and the ability to reflect as well as speak about their journey through a life-altering disease significantly increases patients&rsquo; overall feeling of wellbeing and reduces anxiety about future uncertainty."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: There has recently been a growing interest towards patients' affective and emotional needs, especially in relational therapies, which are considered vital as to increase the understanding of those needs and patients' well-being. In particular, we paid attention to those patients who are forced to spend the last phase of their existence in residential facilities, namely elderly people in nursing homes, who often feel marginalized, useless, depressed, unstimulated or unable to communicate. The aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of pet therapy in improving well-being in the elderly living in a nursing home. METHODS: This is a longitudinal study with before and after intervention variables measurement in two groups of patients of a nursing home for elderly people. One group followed an AAI intervention (experimental group) the other one did not (control group). As to perform an assessment of well-being we measured the following dimensions in patients: anxiety (HAM-A), depression (GDS), apathy (AES), loneliness (UCLA), and quality of life (QUALID). Both groups filled the questionnaires as to measure the target variables (time 0). Once finished the scheduled meetings (time 1), all the participants, including the control group, filled the same questionnaires. RESULTS: In accordance with scientific evidence the results confirmed a significant reduction of the measured variables. Especially for the quality of life, which showed a greater reduction than the other. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation and success of the Pet Therapy could have a great emotional and social impact, bringing relief to patients and their family members, but also to health professionals.",

An important premise is that when pet therapy is used in prisons a symbiotic relationship develops between pets and prison inmates which, at the same time, improve their relationships with people themselves. Relational-Cultural Theory posits that relationships with individuals are not just a means to an end. Rather, good relationships promote growth and healthy development; they also cultivate reciprocal empathy. Hence, a major reason of suffering for most people is their experience of isolation; healing can occur in growth-fostering relationships.",

Due to a lack of established treatments for ASD, alternative therapies have been the primary form of intervention. One of these alternatives is pet therapy, a field that has experienced growing interest and has recently accumulated studies that investigate its efficacy. This article reviews and summarizes that effectiveness as well as the findings and limitations associated with pet therapy for ASD. The majority of research on ASD and pet therapy has examined children and has primarily used dogs and horses for therapy. Studies have shown positive effects for the therapy, including high satisfaction rates among the participants' families. Major limitations of studies in the current literature include the lack of control groups and small sample sizes. Future research should incorporate better study designs and large samples to validate pet therapy as an appropriate treatment for ASD.",

For both questionnaires, paired t-test was used and adjusted P-values were obtained using the Hochberg step-up Bonferroni method. RESULT: The mean scores for depressive symptoms significantly improved from the pre-pet therapy (10.1 ± 6.3) compared with the post-pet therapy (6.3 ± 5.9) (P<0.0001). Likewise mean scores of the state anxiety significantly improved from the pre-pet therapy test (44.8 ± 11.7) compared with the post-pet therapy (34.5 ± 10.5) (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Pet therapy significantly reduced anxiety and depression in antepartum hospitalized women with high-risk pregnancies.",

METHODS: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 15-items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were administered to 10 patients (pet group) and 11 controls (control group) together with a self-perceived quality-of-life questionnaire, before and after a pet therapy intervention that lasted 6 weeks. MMSE and GDS mean scores were compared between and within groups by Student's t-test. RESULTS: Both the pet group and control group improved on GDS and MMSE. Within the pet group, GDS symptoms decreased by 50% (from 5.9 to 2.7, P= 0.013), whereas mean MMSE score increased by 4.5 (P= 0.060). The between group comparison showed a positive effect of pet therapy intervention on GDS (P= 0.070). Most of the participants reported an improvement of their perceived quality of life.

METHODS: A single group pre-post-quasi-experimental design with mixed methods was used in 59 hospitalized patients. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate changes from baseline following a pet therapy intervention. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, patients had significant decreases in pain, respiratory rate and negative mood state and a significant increase in perceived energy level. Quantitative and qualitative findings provide support for decreased tension/anxiety and fatigue/inertia and improved overall mood. CONCLUSIONS: Pet therapy is a low-tech, low-cost therapy that improved mood and was meaningful to hospitalized patients.",

OBJECTIVE: The authors obtained information from college freshmen about their relationships with pets and investigated interest in a pet therapy program as social support for transient stressful periods. PARTICIPANTS: As part of a university orientation program, 246 college freshman attended 1 of 5 health issues sessions offered during the 2006-2007 academic year. Approximately 50 freshmen attended each session. METHOD: Participants completed a questionnaire at the beginning of the session, followed by a 20-minute presentation about pet therapy that ended with pet therapy visitation. RESULTS: Students identified that visits with certified pet therapy dogs could be beneficial to college freshman during their first year away from home. CONCLUSIONS: These students indicated that a pet therapy program could temporarily fill the absence of previous support systems and be a catalyst for establishing new social relationships.",

METHODS: The first step to identify the papers of interest was the access to the MEDLINE library from 1960 until June 2007 and the Cochrane controlled trials registry. RESULTS: At present there is consistent evidence of the protective effect against cardiovascular risk, mainly through the moderate exercise prompted by walking a dog. Indeed, walking a dog may contribute to a physically active lifestyle. Moreover, patients suffering from chronic illness are likely to benefit from pet companionship. CONCLUSIONS: There is a contrast between physical effects (for which the evidence is fairly clear) and the psychological benefits (for which the evidence is controversial). Further randomised researches are necessary to convey scientific dignity to the human - animal relationship.",

The impact of AAA (animal-assisted activities), a kind of pet therapy, on oncological patients submitted to chemotherapy was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of patients receiving chemotherapy with (experimental group) or without AAA (control group) were compared. The 2 participating dogs have been trained by a cynophilist behaviourist and examined by a veterinarian. Before and after chemotherapy both groups of patients were asked to fill out a A.De.Ss.O. test questionnaire, a simplified Italian version of Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded. RESULTS: Depression improved only in the AAA group (p=0.01). Arterial oxygen saturation increased in the experimental group (p=0.004), while it decreased in the controls. CONCLUSION: AAA during chemotherapy reduces depression of patients and increases their arterial oxygen saturation.",

METHOD: A convenience sample of 25 English-speaking children ages 5 to 18 years who underwent surgery and experienced acute postoperative pain participated in a standard, one-time CVT intervention. Each child completed a pre-post survey and a post intervention interview. FINDINGS: Quantitative pre-post findings indicate that CVT significantly reduced perceived pain. Qualitative findings suggest that one mechanism that makes CVT effective may be cognitive. That is, CVTdistracts children from pain-related cognition and possibly activates comforting thoughts regarding companionship or home. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that CVT may be a useful adjunct to traditional pain management for children. IMPLICATIONS: Nurses may better serve their patients when CVT is an option.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess whether a pet therapy program had a favorable effect on psychopathological status and perception of quality of life in cognitively unimpaired institutionalized elderly. Seven elderly rest homes in Veneto Region of Northern Italy participated in the project, which was conducted on 144 cognitively intact elderly residents (97 females and 47 males). The participants were randomly divided into three groups: 48 subjects were given a canary, 43 subjects were given a plant, and 53 subjects were given nothing. The observation period (t0-t1) lasted for 3 months. At time t0 and t1 participants were administered the mini mental state examination (MMSE) to assess their cognitive status, the LEIPAD II-Short Version (LEIPAD-SV), to gauge subjective perception of quality of life in the elderly, and the brief symptom inventory (BSI), for self-evaluation of the presence of psychopathological symptoms. At the end of the 3-month trial, tests were re-administered, without removing the experimental condition. Even if the group that received a plant seemed to benefit from the experience, they did not achieve the same positive results on BSI and quality of life subscales exhibited by the group that received a pet. This study reinforces the hypothesis that pet therapy may have a beneficial effect on the psychological well being of institutionalized elderly, in particular on aspects related to depressive symptoms and perception of quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The widespread inclusion of companion animals into the homes and lives of humans has prompted a considerable amount of research into the health benefits of such relationships. Findings seem to confirm that if humans interact with companion animals they are likely to experience various health benefits. Programmes that encourage and facilitate pet visiting schemes in hospitals have developed and animals can often be found in in-patient and long-term care facilities, with the aim of contributing towards a positive therapeutic milieu. Despite supportive research evidence, the adoption of such a therapeutic activity may have been restricted by the belief that client safety could be compromised by an increase in the risk of infection acquired from animals, allergic responses and bites. This paper explores the literature on these risks and concludes that, in a controlled health care environment in urban Europe or North America and with responsible human behaviour the potential benefits of sharing our lives with companion animals, either at home or hospital, far outweigh the apparently insignificant risks. Recommendations aimed at limiting the potential risk of infection and guidelines for the safe management of pet therapy are developed.",

A demonstrable impact could lead to more widespread or targeted use of animal companionship programs for hospitalized older persons. METHOD: The study design was a randomized, parallel-group control treatment trial with pretreatment and posttreatment measures. Fifty-eight subjects with chronic age-related disabilities who were patients of the Wills Eye Hospital Geriatric Psychiatry Unit were assigned to a pet therapy intervention group or an exercise control group for 1 hr a day for 5 consecutive days. Every subject was blindly evaluated with the Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES) before and after the intervention week. RESULTS: No significant differences in MOSES scores were found between or within groups before and after the interventions. There was a nonsignificant tendency for subjects who received the pet intervention to have less irritable behavior after treatment. However, women with dementia who received either pet therapy or exercise intervention had improved irritable behavior scores after treatment. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates the need for further research on animal-assisted interventions with hospitalized elderly persons. Differential improvement in women with dementia also requires further investigation.",

The research, carried out in geriatric facilities in upstate New York, focused on community members and college students working in a pet therapy program, through which they brought companion animals to various institutions on a weekly basis. Visiting people and pets re-created an aura of domesticity for residents who had been cut off from homes and families by age and illness. Consonant with this domestic perception by residents was the self-image that volunteers developed of their role: most came to see themselves as family and friends to patients rather than as visitors, strangers, or adjunct staff. Volunteering, however, was an emotionally demanding experience that some people handled more successfully than others. While certain individuals found the costs of this unexpected intimacy to be too high, others discovered significant rewards in what one person called its 'selfish altruism.' Several factors were found to mediate how volunteers felt about what they did, and whether or not they continued with their work over a long period of time. These variables included: (a) the motives that people had for becoming volunteers, (b) their prior experience doing this kind of work, (c) their career orientations, and current family and living situation, and (d) the image that they had of the elderly in general and nursing homes in particular.",

Observations took place on three separate occasions (absence of dog, temporary presence of the dog, and permanent placement of the dog) in both group and individual settings. The results showed that the presence of the dog increased the number of total social behaviors of the AD clients, but no differences were found in behaviors between the temporary and permanent placement of the dog.",
