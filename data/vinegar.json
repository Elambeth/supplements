      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Frankincense, is extensively used in both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Indian practices for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). In TCM, it is typically subjected to process with vinegar, which is believed to enhance its therapeutic efficacy. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the underlying mechanism of frankincense vinegar processing from the perspective of bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-active bacteria preference and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) hydrolysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC model was used to elucidate the superior improving effects of vinegar-processed frankincense (PF). 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing along with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-TQ-MS) were employed to reveal the differential bacteria and its related disturbance of GDCA. The effects of PF and GDCA on BSH-active bacteria were confirmed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and in vitro experiments. Finally, the pro-inflammatory effects of GDCA and the mechanisms by which PF ameliorates UC were verified by establishing a UC pseudo-sterile mice model with GDCA intervention. RESULTS: PF exhibited remarkable mitigating effects on UC (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Specifically, PF enhanced the BSH activity of Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus (P < 0.01), thereby promoting their dissociation efficiency toward glycine-conjugated bile acids (G-CBAs), particularly GDCA (P < 0.01). Furthermore, PF reduced GDCA levels by regulating the dissociation efficiency of Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus toward GDCA, thereby alleviating GDCA-induced exacerbation of UC. CONCLUSION: PF exhibits its superior amelioration effects on UC by enhancing the dissociation efficiency of Bifidobacteruum longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus towards G-CBAs, particularly GDCA."

      "abstract": "Motion picture films made of cellulose acetate (CA) are subjected to degradation mainly due to the \"vinegar syndrome\". The goal of this study is to investigate the absorption of acetic acid vapor by some polyethyleneimine (PEI) xerogels, aim at developing innovative, inexpensive, reusable, and easy-to-produce and handle chemical inhibitors for the \"vinegar syndrome\". PEI-based xerogels (SPEI) are obtained through cryo-polymerization via epoxy-amine reaction between PEI and 1,4-Butanediol di-glycidyl ether (BDDE). The intent is to enhance the absorption of the acetic acid vapor by the porous and high-specific surface area network of the obtained PEI xerogel, allowing its neutralization through the free amino groups present in the gel. A chemical-physical, morphological, and rheological characterization of the SPEIs is performed and their behavior in the absorption and desorption of acetic acid is also studied. The efficacy of the SPEI in inhibiting the \"vinegar syndrome\" is evaluated on both CA-based real motion picture films, on which the deacetylation process is artificially and naturally induced. The characterization of degraded CA films stored with and without the inhibitor is evaluated using an already validated multi-analytical protocol. The excellent results achieved open interesting perspectives for the conservation of these 20th-century cultural heritage objects."

      "abstract": "Spotty liver disease (SLD) caused by Campylobacter hepaticus has emerged as an important cause of disease in table egg layers in the United States. The disease associated with C. hepaticus results in focal lesions on the livers of infected birds, reduced egg production, and increased mortality of layer hens. Currently, there are no approved treatments and no commercial vaccine available for C. hepaticus, and very limited research is available supporting best approaches for the control of C. hepaticus in organic or antibiotic free-laying hens. We assessed the potential effects of water acidification treatments for the control of C. hepaticus in challenged specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and transmission of the organism to naïve birds. The objective of this study was to develop a challenge and treatment model to assess the effects of oregano, apple cider vinegar, and citric acid as potential control measures for C. hepaticus in challenged birds. We divided 148 SPF chickens, 17 wk of age, into five groups; four groups (with 51% of the birds in each group orally challenged with C. hepaticus) and one negative control group (n = 8). A dose of 107 cfu/ml of C. hepaticus was given on day 1, day 4, and day 7 by oral gavage. At day 10 after the day 1 challenge, three challenged groups were treated for 5 days with either oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid in the water. One challenged but not treated group and the negative control received only water as treatment. Bile and liver samples from challenged and nonchallenged naïve exposed birds were collected from euthanatized birds at days 9, 15, 20, and 27 after the first day challenge to evaluate the presence of C. hepaticus gross lesions and detection via culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation. Results showed that challenged birds were able to develop mild to moderate multifocal liver lesions resembling SLD. Severe lesions were evident in the naïve, exposed nonchallenged birds. Positive bacterial culture and colony PCR positives were found in challenged birds in each challenge group. Results from PCR of DNA extracted from liver samples were able to detect a greater number of C. hepaticus-positive samples than culture PCR of bile alone. Treatment with oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid was not able to clear C. hepaticus from challenged birds because more than 44% of the challenged birds remained positive on liver PCR analysis posttreatment. Results also found that C. hepaticus could be passed horizontally because more than 29% of the naïve nonchallenged birds became C. hepaticus positive postintroduction to challenged birds. Overall, this study found that this challenge model for C. hepaticus was successful and that treatments did not clear C. hepaticus in challenged birds. Nevertheless, it appears that acidifying the water could help to reduce C. hepaticus load in naïve birds because in groups treated with oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid C. hepaticus could not be cultured from bile.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soil salinity is a major environmental concern that affects the production of salt-sensitive crops such as cucumbers by limiting their growth and development. Wood vinegar is used as a biostimulant in agriculture to enhance crop productivity and improve the plant's defense system against pathogens, while studies show that it can also protect against oxidative stresses. A factorial experiment was arranged based on a randomized completely design with three replicates and carried out to mitigate the negative effects of sodium chloride (NaCl) on cucumber seedlings through pistachio wood vinegar (PWV) foliar spraying. The seedling was sprayed at the three-leaf stage of growth by PWV (0, 1500, and 3000 ppm) and salinity stress (0, and 150 mM NaCl) was imposed at the five-leaf stage gradually (from 25 to 150 mM NaCl) in the modified Hoagland's solution. RESULTS: The intense salinity stress reduced the fresh and dry mass of root and shoot by 25, 5, 34, and 13%, and decreased chlorophyll a, b, total, and carotenoids by 14, 45, 28, and 44%, respectively compared to the control. Also, in the treated plants with PWV decreased levels of total protein (14%). While PWV treatment decreased the negative effects of the intense salinity stress and enhanced the fresh mass root (41%), dry mass shoot (33%), shoot length (23%), leaf area (34%), leaf number (63%), Chl a (14%), Chl b (11%) and carotenoids (56%). Under the intense salinity stress, the foliar spraying of PWV, 3000 ppm, decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) by 7 and 10%, respectively compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the use of PWV (1500 ppm) via its nutrient and bioactive components is effective in improving the negative effects of the salinity (150 mM NaCl) in cucumber seedlings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Contaminated surfaces play a crucial role in transmitting infectious diseases. Effective surface disinfection is essential for interrupting disease transmission by eliminating pathogens on these surfaces. While traditional chemical disinfectants are effective, they pose significant health and environmental concerns, prompting the search for natural alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of vinegar and asafoetida solution in surface disinfection. METHODS: The swab test was conducted on 10 different surfaces, including rough and smooth surfaces, contaminated with organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Samples were collected before and after applying the test solution. Additionally, a real-settings swab test was performed on 20 sites with diverse textures within hospital and workplace settings to assess the practical applicability of the test solution in reducing microbial contamination. SETTING: The study was conducted in laboratory settings, followed by real-world application in hospital and workplace environments. INTERVENTION: The test solution, composed of vinegar and asafoetida, was applied to contaminated surfaces to assess its disinfection efficacy. Positive controls included 1% sodium hypochlorite and 5% phenol, while distilled water served as the negative control. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the reduction in microbial colony counts after the application of the test solution, quantified through swab samples before and after disinfection. RESULTS: Significant reductions in microbial colonies were observed across all tested surfaces following the application of the test solutions, with complete elimination achieved on many surfaces. Percent reductions in microbial colonies ranged from 50% to 100%, and log reductions varied from 0.2 to undefined i.e., complete reduction. CONCLUSION: The test solution effectively reduced microbial loads on smooth and rough surfaces, demonstrating its potential as a natural disinfectant. However, its long-term residual activity and efficacy against viral strains were not evaluated. Therefore, future research should address these gaps to optimize the application of the solution."

Forty-five primary incisors in thirty children. The treatment was performed under local anesthesia with rubber dam isolation. Sterile paper points were inserted for 60 s to collect the first bacterial swab (S1). Root canal walls were prepared and irrigated with 22 mL within 5 min according to the following groups (randomly with 1:1:1 allocation ratio): Group A: (n = 15) with 5% PPE, Group B: (n = 15) with 5% ACV, and Group C: (n = 15) with 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Canals were dried with paper points, and paper point was placed in each canal for 60 s to collect the second bacterial swab (S2). Bacterial colonies were counted after 48-hour incubation at 37 °C and the bacterial counts in the S1 and S2 for each sample were compared using the decimal logarithm. Intra-group comparisons were made using Paired sample t and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests. Between-groups comparisons were made using One-Way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and Independent Samples tests. The significance level was set at α = 0.05. PPE demonstrated a 60.43% reduction in CFU count, ACV demonstrated a 51.56% reduction in CFU count, while NaOCl showed an 87.49% reduction in CFU count. Although NaOCl has shown effectiveness in reducing bacterial counts, PPE and ACV have also displayed some antibacterial activity. However, their overall efficacy is less established, which raises questions about their viability as a natural alternative to a 5% NaOCl.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the effects of ultrasound treatment on bioactive components and functional properties of hawthorn vinegar (Crataegus tanacetifolia) were investigated. Parameters such as total phenolic compound (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), ascorbic acid (AA), DPPH radical scavenging activity and CUPRAC reducing capacity were optimised by surface response method (RSM) and 14 min duration and 61.40 % amplitude were determined as the most suitable treatment conditions. The results showed that ultrasound treatment improved the antioxidant properties of hawthorn vinegar by increasing TPC, TFC, DPPH and CUPRAC values. In addition, it was observed that hawthorn vinegar samples exhibited anticancer effects in cell culture experiments. In experiments on A549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast) and HT-29 (colon) cancer cell lines, ultrasound-treated vinegar increased apoptotic effects, suppressed cell migration and reduced necrosis rates in some cell lines. In particular, ultrasound treatment of vinegar resulted in a reduction in the expression of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL-2 and XIAP) and an enhancement in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes (BAX). These findings suggest that ultrasound technology preserves and enhances the bioactive components of hawthorn vinegar, improves its anticancer properties and increases its potential for use as a functional food product.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementing drinking water with apple vinegar and essential oils, compared to an antibiotic growth promoter, on the growth performance, serum lipid profile, antioxidant status, intestinal morphology, and gastrointestinal microflora population of broiler chickens. A total of 240 one-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly assigned to four treatments, each consisting of six replicate pens with ten birds per pen. The broiler chickens received the following experimental treatments: normal drinking water without additives (control) and drinking water supplemented with antibiotic (0.25 ml/L), apple vinegar (1 ml/L), and essential oils blend (0.5 ml/L). The results showed that adding antibiotic or essential oils blend to drinking water improved body weight gain and feed conversion ratio throughout the entire rearing period (P < 0.05). The serum levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein in broilers that received apple vinegar or essential oils blend were lower than those in the control and antibiotic groups (P < 0.05). The essential oils blend treatment significantly increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the serum of broiler chickens compared to the other treatments (P < 0.05). Furthermore, adding essential oils blend to the drinking water increased villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in the jejunum of broilers (P < 0.05). The broiler chickens in the apple vinegar and essential oil blend groups also exhibited a lower population of Enterobacteriaceae and a higher count of lactic acid bacteria in the ceca (P < 0.05). In summary, the addition of essential oils blend to the drinking water of broiler chickens has beneficial effects on production performance and can serve as an effective alternative to antibiotic growth promoters.",

We purified a novel polysaccharide from vinegar-processed Schisandra chinensis (VSC) and used intestinal microbiota 16S rRNA analysis and metabolomics to study changes in T2DM mice after vinegar-processed Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (VSP) intervention, aiming to elucidate how VSP alleviates T2DM. VSP has shown significant therapeutic effects in T2DM mice, which can regulate the imbalance of glucose and lipid metabolism, alleviate pancreatic and liver damage, restore the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and inhibit the inflammatory response. Serum metabolomics and microbiological analysis showed that VSP could significantly regulate 104 endogenous metabolites and rectify gut microbiota disorders in T2DM mice. Additionally, VSP enhanced the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the expression of GPR41/43 in the colon of T2DM mice. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations among specific gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and fecal SCFAs. Overall, these findings will provide a basis for further VSP development.",

      "abstract": "Rice is an important cereal crop for over half of the world population and essential for food security, especially in developing countries where it constitutes a substantial part of daily caloric intake. Wood vinegar, obtained from biomass pyrolysis and rich in organic acids, phenols, esters, sugars, and alcohols, promotes crop growth and productivity. Its diverse composition offers an eco-friendly and cost-effective growth promoter and improves stress tolerance in different crops; however, its optimal application timings in rice cultivation remain underexplored. Our study investigated the effects of wood vinegar on rice growth, photosynthetic efficiency, chlorophyll contents, soluble sugars, phenolics, grain chalkiness, and yield at different stages and combinations such as tillering (T), jointing (J), flowering (F), grain filling (G), T + J, T + F, T + G, J + F, J + G, F + G, T + J + F, T + J + G, T + F + G, and J + F + G. Our results indicate that wood vinegar application at T + J + F stages significantly enhanced the photosynthetic rate by promoting gaseous exchange, chlorophyll contents, and SPAD index when compared with control. Additionally, total soluble sugars (9.71 mg g-1) and phenolics (2.4 mg g-1) levels were noticeably induced during wood vinegar application as compared with corresponding control. Besides, this treatment also elevated the yield by up to 32.4%, reduced grain chalkiness, and enhanced head rice percentage. Taken together, these findings suggest that wood vinegar supports sustainable agriculture by improving crop yield and quality, offering considerable benefits to farmers.",

      "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitutes a significant health concern because it promotes infectious mastitis in dairy animals and poses a hazard risk to humans. Controlling MRSA infections is a growing challenge on a global scale because of the bacteria's toxicity and its capacity to develop multidrug resistance (MDR). Combating against MDR bacteria and the spread of infectious diseases needs natural antibacterial alternatives to minimize the economic losses of mastitis. The average treatment cost in Egypt was highlighted. The antibacterial effect of apple cider vinegar (ACV) against MDR-MRSA isolates was evaluated, also the study aimed at profiling antimicrobial resistance genes in MRSA isolates. The incidence of mastitis in cows was more than in buffaloes, and the average total treatment cost was estimated at 82 million EGP from 2016 to 2021 (around 14 million EGP annually). Of the 22 S. aureus isolates (20 %), of which (59.1 % were from cows and 40.9 % from buffaloes), 19 (86.4 %) were confirmed as MRSA. All MRSA isolates exhibited resistance to clindamycin (94.7 %), then both ampicillin and doxycycline (84.2 %), and ampicillin and sulbactam, erythromycin and Fosfomycin (each, 78.9 %). Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin can be used to treat MRSA. The prevalence of MDR was significantly high, with 94.7 % of the cases having multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) indices ranging from 0.25 to 0.75. All MRSA isolates tested positive for mecA, 89.5 % for the blaZ gene, 84.2 % for tetM, and 73.4 % for ermB. In vitro, the antibacterial properties of ACV were demonstrated to be superior by our results which demonstrate a zone of inhibition with diameters ranging from 20 to 40 mm detected by Agar well diffusion technique and MIC's (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) ranging from 2 to 4 μg/ml. Some isolates possess MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentration) values at the same MIC. This research proposes the potential of ACV to act as a promising antibacterial alternative against MRSA. This can help minimize the health problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and improve the efficiency of dairy farms. Further studies are recommended to determine the proper dosage for field administration.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The primary cause of memory loss is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown that natural compounds like apple cider vinegar (ACV) have anti-Alzheimer's capabilities. Essential components of ACV, such as gallic acid and chlorogenic acid, may be in charge of the drug's pharmacological effects. METHODS: Using molecular docking and dynamics (MD), the current work looks at the aspect of ACV that protects against AD. To study the conformational relationships and interaction mechanisms between two biological molecules (such as interactions between proteins and drugs or between proteins), MD simulation is frequently used. MD can help understand molecular structural differences between proteins and small compounds. We used acetylcholinesterase (AChE, PDB ID: 1UT6) to MD chlorogenic and gallic acids, as well as the currently prescribed medication rivastigmine (Standard medication). Furthermore, we determine the binding affinity, which may be responsible for AChE inhibition. MD simulations were performed on docked complexes of chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, and rivastigmine with receptor 1UT6 for a 300 ns trajectory to ensure the stability of docked ligand-protein complexes. RESULTS: The results showed that chlorogenic acid has the highest binding affinity and stability for AChE inhibition. In the docking and dynamics analysis, both techniques have predicted chlorogenic acid to be a potential constituent of ACV which shows a similar activity when compared to rivastigmine by virtue of binding affinity. CONCLUSION: These findings identify chlorogenic acid as the key component of ACV that protects against AD-related cognitive and behavioral impairments. This finding will be critical in the development of ACV-based drugs for Alzheimer's disease treatment.",

Our primary aim was to challenge atopic beagles to dust mites and measure pH and TEWL during a flare of atopic dermatitis and correlate these parameters to clinical signs. A secondary aim was to evaluate in a randomized placebo-controlled study whether the daily application of 50/50 vinegar spray improves clinical signs and affects skin parameters despite the allergen challenge. Fifteen atopic dogs were challenged epicutaneously twice weekly for 2 weeks with allergen application on the inguinal and medial thigh areas. The severity of dermatitis was scored daily (CADESI-03). TEWL and pH were measured daily on the inguinal and medial thigh areas. A repeated measures ANOVA showed the significant effect of time, with increased pH (p < 0.0001), TEWL (p < 0.0001), and CADESI (p < 0.0001) during allergen challenge. Significant positive correlations were found between CADESI and pH (r = 0.3556; p < 0.0001), CADESI and TEWL (r = 0.36; p < 0.0001), and pH and TEWL (r = 0.45; p < 0.0001). Daily application of 50/50 vinegar did not improve dermatitis, pH, and TEWL compared to the control treatment. It can be concluded that both pH and TEWL are markers of disease severity in canine atopic dermatitis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arabinoxylan is commonly used as a hydrocolloid in frozen dough to improve the texture and the sensory qualities of the products. The effects of vinegar residue arabinoxylan (VRAX) on the secondary structures and microstructures of gluten proteins during freeze-thaw storage were studied, and the underlying mechanism governing these effects was clarified. RESULTS: The results revealed that VRAX improved the textural properties of gluten proteins, but had a negative impact on their viscoelasticity. Additionally, the addition of VRAX increased the number of disulfide bonds and also improved the freezing tolerance of the gluten proteins. It was found that the enthalpy of the gluten proteins decreased by 19.78% following VRAX addition. As a result of the use of VRAX, the freezing procedure resulted in reduced formation of ice crystals, protecting the gluten network structure and preserving the dough's elasticity. The network structure of gluten proteins after VRAX treatment was more ordered and integrated relative to that of frozen blank control gluten proteins. CONCLUSION: Overall, the freeze-thaw stability of the gluten proteins was enhanced by VRAX. These results suggest that VRAX has potential as an effective cryoprotectant in frozen dough. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatic fibrosis, a chronic pathological condition resulting from various forms of persistent liver injury, in the later stage, it can evolve into cirrhosis and even liver cancer. Curcumae Rhizoma (CR), traditionally recognized for its properties in line qi break blood, eliminate accumulation and relieve pain. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) principles, vinegar-processing enhances CR's ability to enter the liver meridian and act on the blood level, potentially augmenting its therapeutic effects on hepatic diseases. Therefore, vinegar-processed Curcumae Rhizoma (VCR) is frequently employed in treating liver fibrosis and related hepatic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms of vinegar processing in enhancing its therapeutic efficacy remain unclear. METHODS: The anti-liver fibrosis effects of CR and VCR were verified at individual and cellular levels. Subsequently, HPLC-Q-TOFMS and pharmacokinetic analysis were utilized to elucidate the potential bioactive substances underlying the enhanced anti-fibrotic efficacy of VCR. Building upon these findings, network pharmacology and metabolomics were integrated to screen for key effect components and regulatory pathways. Finally, the mechanisms of action were further analyzed and validated at the tissue and cellular levels through Western blotting (WB) and molecular docking studies. RESULTS: Both CR and VCR exhibited therapeutic effects against hepatic fibrosis, with VCR demonstrating enhanced efficacy after vinegar processing. 6 sesquiterpenes including furanodiene and curdione, showed significant alterations in plasma exposure and hepatic distribution post-processing. VCR significantly improved pathological liver conditions, lipid accumulation, and fibrosis severity. Additionally, VCR markedly reduced the expression of α-SMA in the liver and attenuated the elevations in liver function markers such as ALT and AST. Combined network pharmacology, metabolomics, and hepatic tissue WB analysis revealed that the reduced phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a critical mechanism in VCR's anti-fibrotic effects. Experiments on LX-2 cells demonstrated that four sesquiterpenes, including furanodiene and curdione, effectively inhibited the proliferation of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Furanodiene, in particular, promoted apoptosis in activated HSCs by reducing phosphorylation levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins, increasing BAX expression, and activating downstream caspase-3 to achieve the effect of anti-liver fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Vinegar-processing significantly increases the plasma exposure and hepatic distribution of components such as furanodiene in VCR, enhancing anti-fibrotic efficacy by downregulating the phosphorylation levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and promoting HSC apoptosis. This study provides a comprehensive explanation of the vinegar-processing mechanism and its role in enhancing the anti-fibrotic effects of VCR, offering insights for its clinical application in liver fibrosis treatment and reference for the mechanistic study of other vinegar-processed herbal medicines.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by its incurable nature and undefined etiology, which is often accompanied by a high prevalence of comorbid depression. The gut-brain axis has emerged as a promising treatment target in recent years. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate how vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis (VSC) enhances therapeutic effects on depressive behavior in chronic UC mice. METHODS: A chronic UC model was induced in mice using dextran sulfate sodium. The therapeutic effects of both raw and vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis on UC and associated depressive symptoms were assessed. Colonic mucosal damage was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Alcian blue staining. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and synaptic structures was visualized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to quantify inflammatory cytokine levels in the colon, serum, and brain, while western blotting was performed for protein expression analysis. Additionally, metagenomic analysis was conducted to investigate gut microbiota composition. Nissl staining and immunofluorescence were used to assess hippocampal neuronal damage, and behavioral assessments including the morris water maze, open field test, forced swimming test and tail suspension test, were implemented to evaluate depressive states. Serum metabolites were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Both raw and vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis significantly upregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), inhibited NF-κB p-p65 activation, and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine. These treatments also enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins, restored colonic mucosal and BBB integrity, alleviated damage to hippocampal neurons, and improved synaptic structure. Behavioral assessments indicated that VSC was particularly effective in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors in chronic UC mice. In the gut, both treatments reshaped the gut microbial composition, restoring the relative abundance of Duncaniella, Candidatus_Amulumruptor, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Lachnospiraceae_bacterium, uncultured_Bacteroides_sp., Candidatus_Amulumruptor_caecigallinarius, with VSC showing more pronounced effects. Serum metabolomics revealed an increase in tryptophan levels and a decrease in kynurenine and xanthurenic acid levels with VSC, indicating that tryptophan metabolism shifted from the kynurenine pathway to the 5-HT or indole pathway. However, this phenomenon did not occur with Schisandra Chinensis (SC). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the disruption of tryptophan metabolic balance served as a biological mechanism underlying the occurrence of depressive behaviors induced by UC. The application of SC following vinegar processing enhanced its regulatory effects on gut microbiota and tryptophan metabolism. This findings provided a new insight for the clinical management of gut-brain comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Biomass pyrolysis by-products, such as biochar (BC) and wood vinegar (WV), are widely used as soil conditioners and efficiency enhancers in agriculture. A pot experiment was conducted to examine the effects of WV, both alone and in combination with BC, on soil properties in mildly saline soil and on cotton stress tolerance. The results demonstrated that BC and WV application, either individually or together, increased soil nutrient content. The combined application was more effective than the individual applications, resulting in a 5.18-20.12% increase in organic matter, a 2.65-15.04% increase in hydrolysable nitrogen, a 2.23-58.05% increase in effective phosphorus, and a 2.71-29.38% increase in quick-acting potassium. Additionally, the combined application of WV and BC led to greater improvements in cotton plant height, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), leaf nitrate reductase (NR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities compared to the application of BC or WV alone. The enhancements in this study varied across different parameters. Plant height showed an increase of 14.32-21.90%. Net photosynthetic rate improved by 13.56-17.60%. Leaf nitrate reductase increased by 5.47-37.79%. Superoxide dismutase and catalase showed improvements of 5.82-64.95% and 10.36-71.40%, respectively (p < 0.05). Moreover, the combined treatment outperformed the individual applications of WV and BC, resulting in a significant decrease in MDA levels by 2.47-51.72% over the experimental period. This combined treatment ultimately enhanced cotton stress tolerance. Using the entropy weight method to analyze the results, it was concluded that the combined application of WV and BC could enhance soil properties in mildly saline soils, increase cotton resistance, and hold significant potential for widespread application."

      "abstract": "Rapeseed is an important oil crop in the world. Wood vinegar could increase the yield and abiotic resistance of rapeseed. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of wood vinegar or its valid chemical components on rapeseed. In the present study, wood vinegar and butyrolactone (γ-Butyrolactone, one of the main components of wood vinegar) were applied to rapeseed at the seedling stage, and the molecular mechanisms of wood vinegar that affect rapeseed were studied by combining transcriptome and metabolomic analyses. The results show that applying wood vinegar and butyrolactone increases the biomass of rapeseed by increasing the leaf area and the number of pods per plant, and enhances the tolerance of rapeseed under low temperature by reducing membrane lipid oxidation and improving the content of chlorophyll, proline, soluble sugar, and antioxidant enzymes. Compared to the control, 681 and 700 differentially expressed genes were in the transcriptional group treated with wood vinegar and butyrolactone, respectively, and 76 and 90 differentially expressed metabolites were in the metabolic group. The combination of transcriptome and metabolomic analyses revealed the key gene-metabolic networks related to various pathways. Our research shows that after wood vinegar and butyrolactone treatment, the amino acid biosynthesis pathway of rapeseed may be involved in mediating the increase in rapeseed biomass, the proline metabolism pathway of wood vinegar treatment may be involved in mediating rapeseed's resistance to low-temperature stress, and the sphingolipid metabolism pathway of butyrolactone treatment may be involved in mediating rapeseed's resistance to low-temperature stress. It is suggested that the use of wood vinegar or butyrolactone are new approaches to increasing rapeseed yield and low-temperature resistance.",

The optimal parameters obtained using the response surface methodologies (RSM) were the duration of the ultrasound of 5.5 min and the amplitude of the ultrasound at 57%. When the DPPH values, ACE inhibition %, and TPC and DPPH values obtained with the RSM model were compared with the experimental values, the difference was 9.80, 3.0, and 4.6%, respectively, showing good agreement between actual and predicted values. The higher ultrasound intensities and longer treatment times had a significant effect on antioxidant activity. Poppy vinegar samples significantly induced the apoptosis of lung cancer cells, particularly those stored for 6 and 12 months. The amounts of protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, neohesperidin, hydroxybenzoic acid, resveratrol, rutin, trans-cinnamic acid, quercetin, and flavon in poppy vinegar were determined, which decreased significantly as storage time increased. TPC and TFC were determined to be 90.39 mg of GAE/100 mL and 29.86 mg of TEAC/mL, respectively, and there was no significant change in these bioactive compounds after 6 months of storage. The highest value of ACE inhibitory activity was found at the beginning of the storage period. The present study was the first study to examine the bioactive components, ACE inhibition activity, pro-apoptotic activities, and phenolic composition of traditionally produced ultrasound-treated poppy vinegar during storage. The control of production parameters and the design of ideal poppy vinegar fermentation processes could benefit from this research."

However, the active components and potential mechanisms of synergy are still unclear. The objective of this study was to develop a method that combines bionic technology, plant metabolomics and network pharmacology to discover the active components and potential mechanisms underlying the enhanced therapeutic effects of VCR for PD. Vinegar processing alters the flavor of C. rotundus, leading to changes in its properties. The acidic nature of vinegar enhances the selectivity of the medicine toward the liver, thereby improving its ability to soothe the liver, regulate qi and provide pain relief. Through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis, 30 key differential components between raw C. rotundus and VCR have been screened and identified. These differential components primarily exert their therapeutic effects in treating PD by modulating targets such as interleukin-6, TNF, TP53 and PTGS2, as well as pathways including the estrogen signaling pathway, ovarian steroidogenesis, the TNF signaling pathway and the HIF-1 signaling pathway. The findings of this study serve as a reference for the application of VCR in compound formulas and clinic practiceal. Furthermore, the methodology employed in this study provides research insights for the processing of other Chinese medicines.",

      "abstract": "The gap between serious soil heavy metals pollution and inefficient soil remediation threatens human health. This study proposed a method to improve the phytoremediation efficiency using bamboo vinegar (BV) solution and the potential mechanism was discussed. The results demonstrated that the application of BV increases the content of cadmium (Cd) in vacuole and cell wall hemicellulose 2 in leaves of Perilla frutescens. Simultaneously, it enhanced enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in leaves. Therefore, this process alleviated the damage of Cd to functional tissues of Perilla frutescens, thus improving the tolerance of plants to Cd. Moreover, the BV application reduced the Cd content bound by root cell wall pectin fractions and insoluble phosphate, subsequently improving the ability of oxalic acids to carry Cd to the aerial parts. Consequently, the aerial parts obtained a larger amount of Cd enrichment. Overall, the Transfer Factor of Cd from roots to stems and enrichment of Cd in Perilla frutescens were maximally increased by 57.70 % and 54.03 % with the application of 50-fold and 300-fold diluted BV under 2 mg·L-1 Cd stress, respectively. The results can provide a theoretical basis for the promotion of phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soil treatment technology.",

One such remedy that has gained popularity is apple cider vinegar (ACV). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ACV consumption on weight, blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels in a sample of the Lebanese population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 overweight and obese individuals were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group receiving 5, 10 or 15 mL of ACV or a control group receiving a placebo (group 4) over a 12-week period. Measurements of anthropometric parameters, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels were taken at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. RESULTS: Our findings showed that daily consumption of the three doses of ACV for a duration of between 4 and 12 weeks is associated with significant reductions in anthropometric variables (weight, body mass index, waist/hip circumferences and body fat ratio), blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. No significant risk factors were observed during the 12 weeks of ACV intake. CONCLUSION: Consumption of ACV in people with overweight and obesity led to an improvement in the anthropometric and metabolic parameters. ACV could be a promising antiobesity supplement that does not produce any side effects."

The objective of this study was to compare the inhibitory effect of commercial dry vinegars (DVs) and cultured sugar-vinegar blends (CSVs) on Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus in uncured beef and poultry products during extended cooling. Treatments (beef: 72-73% moisture, pH 6.2-6.3, 0.85-0.95% NaCl; turkey: 76-77% moisture, pH 6.5-6.7, 1.3-1.6% NaCl) included Controls without antimicrobials, and four DV and four CSV, each tested at 0.75 and 1.25%. Batches were inoculated with 2.5-log C. perfringens or B. cereus spores, vacuum-packaged, and cooked to 73 °C. Packages were cooled from 48.8 to 27 °C (Phase 1) in 3, 4, or 5 h; Phase 2 (27-12.8 °C) and Phase 3 (12.8-4 °C) were standardized for 5-h cooling each. Pathogens were enumerated on selective agar in triplicate samples assayed at precook, postcook, and at the end of Phase 1, 2, and 3 cooling. Experiments were conducted twice. B. cereus did not grow (<0.5-log increase) in any treatment when Phase 1 cooling was extended to 5 h. C. perfringens grew rapidly (2.5 to >4.5 log) in Control treatments when Phase 1 cooling was extended to ≥3 h. All 1.25% DV ingredients limited C. perfringens growth to ≤1-log when Phase 1 cooling was extended to 3 h but supported a >1-log increase when Phase 1 cooling was extended to 5 h. All 1.25% CSV inhibited growth under 3-h Phase 1 cooling; 1.25% CSV-A and ≥0.75% CSV-D inhibited growth in turkey during 5-h Phase 1 cooling, but inhibition with 1.25% CSV-C was inconsistent in beef. This study revealed that formulating uncured meats with 1.25% DV or certain CSV can extend Phase 1 cooling to 3 h. Although all ingredients inhibited growth when used at 0.75% or greater compared to a control, greater variability of inhibition was observed among CSV than for DV.",

The effect of routine treatment for lesions lightly stained with Lugol's iodine solution is limited, and the addition of natural substances to a regular diet is becoming increasingly common. Vinegar has antitumor effects as reported in previous studies. AIM: To evaluate whether vinegar supplementation could improve the prognosis of patients with lightly stained esophageal lesions. METHODS: This prospective single-centre trial included consecutive patients with lightly stained lesions between June 2020 and April 2022. Patients in the experimental group received increased amounts of vinegar for 6 months. The primary outcome of the study was the clinical therapeutic effect. Complications related to vinegar ingestion and adverse events were also recorded in detail. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients were included in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in the baseline data between the two groups. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis demonstrated that the rates at which endoscopic characteristics improved were 33.72% in the experimental group and 20.00% in the conventional group (P = 0.007); and the rates at which biopsy pathology improved were 19.77% and 8.75%, respectively (P = 0.011). Additional vinegar consumption had a statistically protective effect on the rate at which endoscopic characteristics improved [hazard ratio (HR) ITT = 2.183, 95%CI: 1.183-4.028; HRper-protocol (PP) = 2.307, 95%CI: 1.202-4.426] and biopsy pathology improved (HRITT = 2.931, 95%CI: 1.212-7.089; HRPP = 3.320, 95%CI: 1.295-8.507). No statistically significant effect of increased vinegar consumption on preventing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or early cancer was observed (HRITT = 0.382, 95%CI: 0.079-1.846; HRPP = 0.382, 95%CI: 0.079-1.846). The subgroup analyses indicated that the overall therapeutic improvement of endoscopic characteristics and biopsy pathology seemed more obvious in older (age > 60) male patients with small lesions (lesion size ≤ 0.5 cm). Three patients in the experimental group reported acid regurgitation and heartburn. No adverse event during gastroscopy were recorded during follow-up. CONCLUSION: A moderately increased ingestion of vinegar could not directly reduce the risk of esophageal cancer in the mucosa dysplasia population, but it improved the endoscopic characteristics and ameliorated the biopsy pathology to a certain extent. Further research is needed to verify the effect of nutritional intervention on precancerous esophageal lesions."

On the 22nd day, PCOS-induced animals were segregated into 4 groups and administered with CMC, ACV, metformin, and a combination of ACV and metformin, respectively. The treatments were continued for 15 days, and on the 36th day, all the animals were sacrificed for biochemical (blood glucose, lipid profile), hormonal (sex hormones and adiponectin), and pro-inflammatory mediator estimations in blood samples. The ovarian tissue samples were used for oxidative stress parameters and histological alterations. The PCOS control animals showed a significant alteration in the estrous cycle. The administration of letrozole resulted in the alteration of hormonal balance and elevation of body weights, glycemic state, lipid profile, pro-inflammatory mediators in serum, and oxidative stress in ovarian samples. Individual treatment groups and combination treatment groups reversed the letrozole-induced alterations in PCOS animals, and more promising results were observed with combination therapy than with individual treatment groups. Further, the therapeutic potential of the combination treatment group was also confirmed by the histological observations in the ovarian samples. The study showed that the combination of ACV and metformin significantly alleviated letrozole-induced PCOS complications in rats. This might have been achieved by mitigating the hormonal imbalance, pro-inflammatory, hyperglycemic, and hyperlipidemic states in serum, and oxidative stress in the ovary samples.",

The experimental setup was designed as a factorial experiment within a randomized complete block design (RCBD), in greenhouse conditions featuring three replications to assess the effects of different culture media (CMs) and concentrations of pistachio wood vinegar (WV) on cucumber seedling growth. Cucumber seeds were planted in three CMs: coco peat-peat moss, coco peat-vermicompost, and date palm compost-vermicompost mixed in a 75:25 volume-to-volume ratio. These were then treated with pistachio WV at concentrations of 0, 0.5, and 1%, applied four times during irrigation following the emergence of the third leaf. RESULTS: The study revealed that treating seedlings with 0.5% WV in the date palm compost-vermicompost CM significantly enhanced various growth parameters. Specifically, it resulted in a 90% increase in shoot fresh mass, a 59% increase in shoot dry mass, an 11% increase in root fresh mass, a 36% increase in root dry mass, a 65% increase in shoot length, a 62% increase in leaf area, a 25% increase in stem diameter, a 41% increase in relative water content (RWC), and a 6% improvement in membrane stability index (MSI), all in comparison to untreated seedlings grown in coco peat-peat moss CM. Furthermore, chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid levels were 2.3, 2.7, 2.6, and 2.7 times higher, respectively, in seedlings treated with 0.5% WV and grown in the date palm compost-vermicompost CM, compared to those treated with the same concentration of WV but grown in coco peat-peat moss CM. Additionally, the Fv/Fm ratio saw a 52% increase. When plant nutrition was enhanced with the date palm compost-vermicompost CM and 1% WV, auxin content rose by 130% compared to seedlings grown in coco peat-peat moss CM and treated with 0.5% WV. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that using 0.5% WV in conjunction with date palm compost-vermicompost CM significantly betters the quality of cucumber seedlings, outperforming other treatment combinations.",

Secondly, various quality parameters of conventional strawberry vinegar (C-SV), UT-SV, and thermally pasteurized strawberry vinegar (P-SV) samples were compared. RSM was employed to craft the best strawberry vinegar based on consumers ratings of UT-SV. Sensory characteristics, bioactive values, phenolic contents, and organic acid contents of C-SV, UT-SV, and P-SV samples were assessed. Through optimization, the ultrasound parameters of the independent variables were determined as 5.3 min and 65.5 % amplitude. The RSM modeling levels exhibited high agreement with pungent sensation at 98.06 %, aromatic intensity at 98.98 %, gustatory impression at 99.17 %, and general appreciation at 99.26 %, respectively. Bioactive components in UT-SV samples increased after ultrasound treatment compared to C-SV and P-SV samples. Additionally, the amount of malic acid, lactic acid, and oxalic acid increased after ultrasound treatment compared to C-SV samples. Ultimately, UT-SV with high organoleptic properties was achieved.

However, the physiological and biochemical mechanisms through which wood vinegar alleviates biotic stress are poorly understood. In this study, pot experiments were conducted to investigate the resistance and regulation mechanism of wood vinegar prepared from different raw materials (ZM) and from a single raw material (SM) in controlling tomato (Solanum lycopersicum \"Bonny Best\") Fusarium wilt at different concentrations (0.3%, 0.6%, 0.9%, 1.2%, and 1.5%). The results showed that ZM and SM had significant control effects on tomato fusarium wilt under different concentrations in the same growth cycle. Under biotic stress, the two kinds of wood vinegar significantly increased the plant height, stem diameter, leaf area and yield of tomato under the concentration of 0.3%, 0.6%, 0.9% and 1.2%, and significantly reduced the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tomato leaves. The effect of 0.9% treatment was the most significant, ZM and SM significantly increased tomato yield by 122% and 74%, respectively, compared with CK under 0.9% treatment. However, the plant height, stem diameter and leaf area of tomato were significantly reduced under 1.5% treatment, but the content of soluble sugar, soluble protein and vitamin C in tomato fruit was the best. Compared with CK, ZM significantly increased by 14%, 193% and 67%, respectively, and SM significantly increased by 28%, 300% and 159%, respectively. Except for 0.3% treatment, both significantly increased the activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in tomato leaves. The response intensity of two kinds of wood vinegar-physiological and biochemical-to tomato disease resistance, growth and development, showed ZM > SM. The disease index of tomato showed highly significant negative correlation with plant height, stem thickness, leaf area and antioxidant physiology CAT, and highly significant positive correlation with MDA and H2O2 content. In conclusion, ZM was more effective than SM in enhancing tomato disease resistance by promoting tomato growth and development, decreasing leaf MDA and H2O2 content, and inducing antioxidant enzyme activity in leaves at moderate concentrations."

According to the processing theory of TCM, it is believed that stir-baked HSYJ with vinegar may enhance the ability to disperse stagnant hepatoqi and alleviate pain. However, whether the vinegar concoction of HSYJ can enhance the therapeutic effect on the Qi stagnation due to liver depression (LDQS) type of dysmenorrhea and what its mechanism has not been well explained. Based on the processing drugs theory of \"stir-baked with vinegar into liver\", a metabolomic approach was used to investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of stir-baked HSYJ with vinegar to enhance the treatment of dysmenorrhea in rats. By establishing a rat model of dysmenorrhea of the \"LDQS\" type, observation of hemorheology, uterine pathological sections, COX-2 and OTR protein expression and other indicators; analysis of urinary metabolic changes in rats by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technique, to compare the differential biomarkers and metabolic pathways in the treatment of dysmenorrhea due to \"liver stagnation and qi stagnation\" before and after stir-baked HSYJ with vinegar. Stir-baked HSYJ with vinegar significantly inhibited the writhing response of rats, improved hemorheology, repaired damaged diseased uterus and inhibited high expression of COX-2 and OTR proteins in uterus; 68 differential metabolites were screened from the urine of rats, compared with the raw HSYJ, the levels of 14 metabolites were significantly changed in stir-baked HSYJ with vinegar, involving the pathways of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. The potentiating effect of stir-baked HSYJ with vinegar may be related to the regulation of multiple amino acid metabolic pathways.",

      "abstract": "Wood vinegar (WV) is known to retard the release of ammonium (NH4+) from urea by inhibiting urea hydrolysis. However, the effect of WV on nitrogen leaching in soil is not known, and there are few studies on the effect of WV on microbial activity although WV exhibits antibacterial properties against pathogens in agriculture. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of WV on controlling nitrogen leaching and soil microbial activity. Soils were treated with urea and WV, and the available inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the soil were compared with those from soils treated with N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), a commonly used urease inhibitor. The nitrate concentration in the soil was significantly decreased in the WV treatment, although the ammonium concentration was not affected by the WV treatment. Basal soil respiration was significantly increased in the WV and NBPT treatments although the microbial biomass was increased in the urea only treatment. The ammonium nitrogen concentration in the leachate was not significantly different in the WV and urea-treated soil compared to the urea-only treatment. However, the nitrate leaching increased in the soil treated only with urea at 16 days after the treatment although there was no statistically significant difference in the total leached nitrate. Therefore, WV can be used to reduce nitrogen leaching and enhance soil microbial activity.",

      "abstract": "AIMS AND BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the antimicrobial activities of commercially available 5% apple cider vinegar (ACV) against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus casei. Materials and methods: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were conducted using the broth microdilution method. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) of 5.25% was used as a positive control, and comparisons were also made with acetic acid (AA) as the main ingredient in ACV. The three test bacteria treated with the most effective ACV dilution were visualized under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) for structural changes. RESULTS: Minimal inhibitory concentration was determined at 0.625% of the concentration of ACV against S. mutans and E. faecalis and 1.25% of the concentration of ACV against L. casei with two-fold serial dilutions. A concentration of 5 × 10-1% with 10-fold serial dilutions was found to be the MIC value for all three bacteria. No significant differences were found when compared with the positive control (NaOCl) (p = 0.182, p = 0.171, and p = 0.234), respectively, for two-fold serial dilutions and (p = 1.000, p = 0.658, and p = 0.110), respectively for 10-fold serial dilutions. MBC was observed to be 5% ACV for both E. faecalis and S. mutans. However, positive microbial growth was observed on the agar plate when cultured with L. casei. An independent sample t-test showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the antimicrobial activities between 5% ACV and 5% pure AA. TEM revealed cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane disruptions on all three bacteria at MIC value. CONCLUSION: Apple cider vinegar has antimicrobial activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus casei at their respective MIC values. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Apple cider vinegar can be an alternative antimicrobial dental pulp disinfectant to sodium hypochlorite. Apple cider vinegar can be used safely, especially in children's dental pulp therapy and deep caries management, when adequate tooth isolation is not readily achievable. Thus, adverse reactions commonly associated with other frequently used chemical disinfectants can be avoided.",

Herein, the present study aimed to utilize the hydrolysate of vinegar residue (VR) as the only medium to realize the cost-effective production of BC. The BC production was optimized by the single-factor test. The treatment of 6 % VR concentration with 3 % acid concentration at 100 °C for 1.5 h and 96 U/mL of cellulase for 4 h at 50 °C obtained a maximum reducing sugar concentration of about 32 g/L. Additionally, the VR hydrolysate treated with 3 % active carbon (AC) at 40 °C for 0.5 h achieved a total phenol removal ratio of 86 %. The yield of BC reached 2.1 g/L under the optimum conditions, which was twice compared to the standard medium. The produced BC was characterized by SEM, FT-IR, XRD, and TGA analyses, and the results indicated that the BC prepared by AC-treated VR hydrolysate had higher fiber density, higher crystallinity, and good thermal stability. Furthermore, the regenerated BC (RBC) fibers with a tensile stress of 400 MPa were prepared successfully using AmimCl solution as a solvent by dry-wet-spinning method. Overall, the VR waste could be used as an alternative carbon source for the sustainable production of BC, which could be further applied to RBC fibers preparation.",

Using UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS alongside targeted metabolomics techniques, this study probed the variances between crude and processed A. sinensis. We identified 1046 chemical components in total, 123 differential components in stir-fried A. sinensis, and 167 in vinegar-treated ones were screened through multivariate statistical analysis. Moreover, 83 significant compounds, encompassing amino acids, phenolic acids, etc., were identified across both processing methods. The in vitro antioxidant activities of these A. sinensis forms were assessed, revealing a positive correlation between most of the unique components emerging after processing and the antioxidant capabilities. Notably, post-processing, the chemical composition undergoes significant alterations, enhancing the antioxidant activity. Specific compounds, including 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, syringetin-3-O-glucoside, and salicylic acid, greatly influence antioxidant activity during processing."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Antler glue is a classic medicinal to enhance sexual function in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which was first recorded in Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing (Shennong's Classic of the Materia Medica). Vinegar-processing is a classic method of processing traditional Chinese medicine. The method of preparing antler glue by boiling antlers in vinegar and then concentrating them is recorded in Lei Gong Pao Zhi Lun (Master Lei's Discourse on Medicinal Processing). In modern times, the typical processing method of antler glue is water extraction and concentration. However, it is not clear whether there is a difference in the effect of these two processing methods on the chemical composition and pharmacological activity of antler glue. AIM OF THE STUDY: The Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020) records that the processing method of antler glue is water extraction and concentration. But Lei Gong Pao Zhi Lun differs in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020), which records the processing method of vinegar extraction and concentration. The effect of the two processing methods on antler glue's chemical composition and pharmacological activity is unknown. So this study aimed to elucidate the difference between different processing methods on the chemical composition and the treatment effect on oligoasthenospermia of antler glue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: So the automatic amino acid analyzer is used to determine the amino acid content of two different processing methods of antler glue. Proteomics was performed to detect the protein components of two different processing methods of antler glue and analyze them. Cyclophosphamide-induced mice models of oligoasthenospermia were used to study the different pharmacological effects of antler glue in two different processing methods. An automatic sperm analyzer observed the quantity and quality of sperm in mice epididymis. Serum sex hormone testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in mice were tested using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to analyze pathological alterations in mouse testicular tissue. The transcriptome has been used to reveal the potential mechanism of antler glue in treating oligoasthenospermia. Mitochondrial complex activity assay kits were used to assay the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I-V in mouse testicular tissue. Western blot was used to determine the expression of related proteins in mouse testicular tissue. RESULTS: Vinegar-processing can increase the alanine, proline, and glycine content in antler glue, reduce the length of protein peptides in antler glue, and produce a variety of unique proteins. Vinegar-processed antler glue (VAG) increased sperm density, sperm survival, sperm viability, and serum sex hormone levels in oligozoospermic mice. It reversed testicular damage caused by cyclophosphamide, and the effects were differently superior to those of water-processed antler glue (WAG). In addition, transcriptomics and related experiments have shown that VAG can increase the expression of Ndufa2, Uqcr11, Cox6b1, and Atp5i genes and proteins in mouse testis, thus promoting adenosine diphosphate (ATP) synthesis by increasing the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV and V. By promoting the oxidative phosphorylation process to produce more ATP, VAG can achieve the therapeutic effect of oligoasthenospermia. CONCLUSION: Vinegar-processing method can increase the content of active ingredients in antler glue. VAG increases ATP levels in the testes by promoting the process of oxidative phosphorylation to treat oligozoospermia.",

      "abstract": "Background: Toxic Euphorbia kansui (EK) is employed to treat malignant ascites effusion (MAE). EK stir-fried with vinegar (VEK) has been demonstrated to reduce toxicity due to its preserved water-expelling effect. This was demonstrated to be correlated with gut microbiota. Therein, bile acids (BAs) have a bidirectional relationship with the gut microbiota. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore whether BA-mediated gut microbiota influences the water-expelling effect of VEK against MAE. Methods: The MAE rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection of Walker-256 tumor cells. A reliable simultaneous method for the determination of 15 bile acids in rat feces using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was established and applied to analyze the fecal BAs in rats treated with VEK. The screened BA was then administered to VEK-treated MAE rats. The water-expelling effect was evaluated using histopathological analysis, biochemical examination, inflammatory factors in ascites, urine volume, ascites amount, and intestinal aquaporin expression. The microbial composition was determined using 16S rRNA sequencing, and the contents of bile acids were finally measured. Results: VEK decreased the content of fecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), and taurocholic acid (TCA) while increasing the content of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). VEK alleviated liver, stomach, and intestinal injuries; oxidative damage; and inflammation, which were further ameliorated with UDCA intervention. VEK alleviated MAE by increasing the fecal water content, urine volume, and AQP3 protein expression and decreasing the urine levels of Na+, K+, and Cl-. This was retained with the intervention of UDCA. UDCA and VEK regulated the BA metabolism disorder to a certain extent. Analysis of gut microbiota showed that VEK increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and decreased that of Prevotella_9 in MAE rats. The combined administration of UDCA and VEK showed a better modulation of the microbiota structure than that of VEK alone, and the effect of this administration reached closer to the reference state. Conclusion: The water-expelling effect of VEK did not directly depend on the BA-mediated gut microbiota. However, VEK and BAs had a synergistic effect on malignant ascites effusion through the regulation of the gut microbiota. These results provided a scientific basis for the reasonable usage of VEK and the novel combination treatment strategy of VEK and UDCA."

Three types of raw-ripened wild boar loins were produced (C-control treatment, R1 and R2-treatments with the addition of apple vinegar in various production variants). The research aimed to develop a new innovative technology for the production of wild boar loin using apple vinegar for marinating and to determine the impact of apple vinegar on the microbiological and sensory quality, and physico-chemical parameters of the product. As part of the research, a technology for the production of ripened wild boar products was developed and the composition of fatty acids, cholesterol content, pH value, oxidation-reduction potential, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) index, color, microbiological, sensory, and statistical analysis were determined. It was found that the loins were characterized by a high content of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (20.18-43.37%), a low content of trans fatty acids (0.30-0.57%), and a high cholesterol content (75.13-85.28 mg/100 g of the product). Samples with apple vinegar (R1 and R2) were characterized by a lower pH value (5.10-5.70; p < 0.05), a comparable oxidation-reduction potential (409.75-498.57 mV), and a low TBARS index (0.461-1.294 mg malondialdehyde/kg of product). Their color was lighter (L* 38.25-40.65). All the tested loins were characterized by appropriate microbiological quality guaranteeing the storage durability of the product. R1 and R2 treatments were characterized by the greatest juiciness. The highest overall quality was achieved by R1 loins (7.36-7.76 c.u.). The apple vinegar used to marinate the loins had a positive effect on their microbiological and sensory quality as well as physico-chemical parameters. Moreover, the technology guarantees the appropriate quality and health safety of the products."

In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) were used to characterize the correlation between environmental factors and metal morphology in the rotting compost from several angles. The results showed that the humus treated with wood vinegar solution had a high degree of humification and rich aromatic structure. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that the degree of humus aromatization gradually increased during the composting process, which enhanced the complexation of humus (HS) with HMs but had less effect on Ni. In addition, the optimum concentration of wood vinegar (WV) was determined to be 1.75%. The results of the study showed that in the Pb passivation treatment group, the proportion of soluble (Red) and exchangeable states (Exc) converted to oxidized (Oxi) and residual states (Res) was 8%, 14%, 6%, 1%, and 12% in the CK, T1, T2, T3, and T4 treatment groups, respectively; in the Cr passivation treatment group, the proportion of Cr-Red and Cr-Exc converted to oxidized and residual states was 31%, 33%, 25%, 29%, and 25%; in the Cd passivation treatment group, the proportions of Cd-Red and Cd-Exc converted to oxidized and residual states were 5%, 15%, 4%, 9%, and 11%, respectively; whereas the Ni treatment group did not show any significant passivation effect. The proportion of Pb-Oxi was relatively stable, Cr-Oxi was converted to Cr-Res, whereas Cd showed the conversion of Cd-Oxi to Cd-Exc. SUVA254 and SUVA280 showed significant positive correlations with Pb-Res, Cr-Res and Ni-Res, and significant positive correlations with moisture content (MC); whereas MC was significantly negatively correlated with each form of HMs. Total potassium (TK), total nitrogen (TN), and both carbon (TOC) were negatively correlated with Pb-Res and Pb-Exc. Structural equation modeling verified the relationship between environmental factors and HMs, and the composting results showed that the addition of biochar (BC) and a higher percentage of WV could increase compost decomposition and passivate HMs to improve its agronomic function.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Liver injury, the main factor in the pathogenesis of most liver diseases, is a known contributor to acute liver failure, liver fibrosis, or liver cancer. Curcuma phaeocaulis Val. (PEZ) has been broadly used in treating liver injury with satisfying therapeutic effects; however, the mechanism is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to explore the mechanism of PEZ in ameliorating thioacetamide (TAA)-induced zebrafish liver injury based on a comprehensive method integrating network-based computational prediction and experimental validations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole exactive mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Exactive MS/MS) analysis was used to analyze components in raw and vinegar-processed PEZ (VPEZ). Network pharmacology was used to construct a compound-target network for liver injury to predict the possible biological targets of PEZ along with potential signaling pathways. TAA-induced zebrafish larvae liver injury model was established, and the anti-liver injury effect of PEZ by a series of indexes was measured, including liver phenotype analysis, histopathological analysis of liver tissues, and biochemical indexes analysis. Remarkably, the predicted pathway by network pharmacology was further validated using RT-qPCR and Western blotting analyzes in animal experiments. RESULTS: 40 chemical constituents derived from PEZ were identified, while 45 chemical components derived from VPEZ were identified. Based on it, 565 genes related to these identified compounds in PEZ and 1023 genes linked to liver injury were collected by network pharmacology. Critically, KEGG analysis indicated that the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway was recommended as one of the main pathways related to the anti-liver injury effect of PEZ. Experimentally, PEZ could alleviate TAA-induced liver injury. Compared to the liver injury model group without any treatment, the treatment of PEZ significantly reduced the expression of both mRNA and protein targets in the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, the effect of VPEZ was more significant than that of the raw one. CONCLUSION: The raw and vinegar-processed PEZ could ameliorate TAA-induced zebrafish liver injury through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "This study compared the effects of Curcuma longa before and after processing with vinegar on the rat model of dysmenorrhea with the syndrome of liver depression and Qi stagnation to reveal the mechanism of vinegar processing in improving the role of C. longa in soothing liver and relieving pain. The rat model of dysmenorrhea with the syndrome of liver depression and Qi stagnation was established according to the Preparation of the Animal Model of Dysmenorrhea(Draft) and the chronic unpredictable stress me-thod. The changes in the body weight, organ indexes, writhing latency, writhing score, and serum levels of six liver function indicators, sex hormones, pain factors, and blood rheological indicators were measured to evaluate the efficacy of C. longa processed with vinegar or not in treating dysmenorrhea in the rats with syndrome of liver depression and qi stagnation. Compared with the model group, the C. longa group(processed with vinegar or not) showed slow weight loss, increase in writhing latency, and decrease in writhing response(P&lt;0.05). The inhibition rates on writhing in raw C. longa, vinegar-processed C. longa, and positive groups were 33.780%, 64.611%, and 62.466%, respectively. The significantly higher inhibition rate of the vinegar processing group indicated that vinegar-processed C. longa demonstrated more significant therapeutic effect. The vinegar-processed C. longa group showed lower levels of alanine aminotransferase(ALT), alkaline phosphatase(ALP), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), direct bilirubin(DBIL), and total bilirubin(TBIL) and higher level of albumin(ALB)(P&lt;0.05), which indicated that vinegar processing enhanced the therapeutic effect of C. longa on liver injury. The serum levels of estradiol(E_2) and oxytocin(OT) were lower in the vinegar-processed C. longa group(P&lt;0.05), indicating that the vinegar-processed C. longa could regulate the sex hormone levels, reduce the activity of uterine smooth muscle and contraction of uterus, and alleviate the symptoms of dysmenorrhea in rats. Moreover, the vinegar-processed C. longa group showed lower interleukin-6(IL-6) and arginine vasopressin(AVP) levels and higher beta-endorphin(β-EP) level(P&lt;0.05), which indicated that vinegar-processed C. longa regulated the levels of pain factors to exert the pain-relieving effect. Drug intervention decreased the whole blood viscosity low-cut, medium-cut and high-cut values, plasma viscosity, whole blood reduction viscosity low-cut and high-cut values, erythrocyte cumulative pressure, and equation K value of erythrocyte sedimentation rate(P&lt;0.05), and the vinegar-processed C. longa group outperformed other groups. This result indicated that vinegar processing enhanced the function of C. longa in improving the local blood rheology. C. longa processed with vinegar can enter the liver to relieve the da-mage to the heart, liver, kidney, and uterus, repair the liver function, and recover the sex hormone levels and immune function by regulating the levels of sex hormones and pain factors and improving the blood rheology. It activates the pain-relieving mechanism to relieve the pain, protect the liver, and fight inflammation, which is consistent with the theory that vinegar processing facilitates C. longa entering the liver to sooth liver and relieve pain.",

It is characterized by high yield, high moisture and low pH and is rich in lignocellulose and other organic matter. To avoid the environmental pollution caused by VR, it should be properly treated. The industry's existing treatment processes, landfills and incineration, cause secondary pollution and waste of resources. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for environmentally friendly and cost-effective resource recovery technologies for VR. To date, a considerable amount of research has been performed in the area of resource recovery technologies for VR. This review summarizes the reported resource recovery technologies, mainly anaerobic digestion, feed production, fertilizer production, high-value product production and soil/water remediation. The principles, advantages and challenges of these technologies are highlighted. Finally, as a future perspective, a cascade and full utilization model for VR is proposed by considering the inherent drawbacks and economic-environmental feasibility of these technologies."

The results showed that 3.12-4.13% of the marinate liquids were absorbed by beef steak as a result of the marination process. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the marinated and cooked beef steaks in terms of water content, cooking loss, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value, hardness, cohesiveness, and chewiness. However, significant differences were detected in terms of pH value and color values (L*, a*, and b*) (p < 0.01), and springiness, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo (4,5-f) quinoxaline (MeIQx) and total HAA content (p < 0.05). The marination with pomegranate vinegar resulted in the formation of darker steak, while a lighter one was obtained when apple vinegar was used in the marination. The use of balsamic and grape vinegar in the marination process decreased the springiness value compared to the control group. The myofibrillar proteins of beef steaks marinated with different types of vinegar generally showed a similar sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) profile. However, some differences were observed in the band density of some proteins depending on the trial and the type of marination. In this study, of the nine examined HAAs, only two (2-amino-3-methylimidazo (4,5-f) quinoline (IQ) and MeIQx) could be detected and quantified. IQ was detected only in the control group steak (up to 0.51 ng/g), while MeIQx was detected in all treatment groups (up to 2.22 ng/g). The total HAA content varied between 0.59-2.22 ng/g. It was determined that the marination process with different vinegar types had different effects on the total HAA content of the steaks. Using balsamic and apple vinegar in the marination process decreased the total HAA content compared to the control group, but this decrease was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). On the other hand, using grape and pomegranate vinegar in the marination process increased the total HAA content, but this increase was only significant (p < 0.05) in the marination with pomegranate vinegar."

In this study, the incidence of Shiga toxin-producing (STEC) and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli in 310 fresh raw beef samples and the presence of pathogenicity-associated virulence genes in the isolated strains were evaluated. The contamination rate reached 18.06% (STEC, 12.26%; EHEC, 5.81%). The highest rate of identified virulence genes was 8.38% for stx2 and 3.23% for stx2 and eae in STEC and EHEC, respectively. Vinegar N6 significantly lowered E. coli growth in beef samples, depending on its concentration (> 0.5%), treatment temperature (5 or 10 °C), and E. coli type (STEC, EHEC, or enteropathogenic), during 28 days of storage. However, no bactericidal effects were detected, unlike those observed for combined treatment with UV-C LED and vinegar N6. Treatment with vinegar N6 and UV-C LED together may significantly reduce E. coli growth in fresh beef, thereby improving food safety.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Three levels of 'individual herb, herb-pair, and herbal formula' were employed to investigate whether and how the processing of main drugs affected the active constituents of pharmacokinetics in SNS, as well as their impacts on the hepatic CYP450 enzyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were subjected to construct a chronic unpredictable mild stimulation (CUMS) model. A rapid and sensitive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analytical method was developed and validated for simultaneously quantitative evaluation of thirteen potential active compounds of SNS in depressive rat plasma, and successfully applied to a holistic comparison of pharmacokinetics. The differences in pharmacokinetic parameters based on three different forms of drug composition from BR and PRA before and after vinegar-processing were compared. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR and Western Blot were utilized to explore the metabolic activity of three isoforms of CYP450 enzyme scattered in the livers of depressive rats. RESULTS: The characteristic pharmacokinetics profiles of thirteen representative constituents in CUMS rats were influenced by vinegar-processing of BR and PRA and/or the compatibility. In detail, there were significant differences in the Cmax, AUC0-24, AUC0-∞, t1/2, and MRT0-24 of most constituents among the three different forms of drug composition from BR and PRA before and after vinegar-processing, with the most obvious changes in six constituents from the adjuvant and mediating guide drugs. And also, the pharmacokinetic parameters of seven constituents from BR and PRA in SNS containing vinegar-processed products obviously changed after compatibility. Additionally, the mRNA and protein levels of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A1 were observed to increase significantly with the processing of BR and PRA and the combination/formulation. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, SNS containing vinegar-processed products was more conducive to the absorption of most activated constituents compared to the original formula in vivo. The vinegar-processing of BR and PRA and the compatibility co-contribute to the pharmacokinetic variability of active compounds of SNS in CUMS rats, and the extent of contribution varies among drugs, which might be related to the regulation of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. The finding of the investigation could help to better understand how active compounds metabolized in vivo, which might be helpful for guiding the clinical application of SNS containing vinegar-processed products.",

Jujube vinegar lowers lipids, protects the liver, and reduces oxidant capacity, however, it is unknown whether this is due to the gut flora. To further research the role of the gut microbiome in treating hyperlipidemia with jujube vinegar, we looked into whether the action of jujube vinegar is related to the regulation of the gut microbiome. METHOD: Thirty male ICR mice were used. The control group (CON), the high-fat diet (HFD) group, and the vinegar group (VIN) each consisted of ten female ICR mice fed consistently for eight weeks. For each treatment, we kept track of body mass, liver index, blood lipid levels, and oxidative stress state. We also analyzed mouse feces using high-throughput 16srRNA sequencing to examine the relationship between jujube vinegar's hypolipidemic effect and antioxidant activity and how it affects the gut microbiome. RESULTS: Jujube vinegar reduced body weight by 19.92%, serum TC, TG, and LDL-C by 25.09%, 26.83%, and 11.66%, and increased HDL-C by 1.44 times, serum AST and ALT decreased by 26.36% and 34.87% respectively, the blood levels of SOD and GSH-Px increased 1.35-fold and 1.60-fold, respectively. While blood MDA decreased 33.21%, the liver's SOD and GSH-Px increased 1.32-fold and 1.60-fold, respectively, and the liver's MDA decreased 48.96% in HFD mice. The gut microbiome analysis revealed that jujube vinegar increased the intestinal microbial ASV count by 13.46%, and the F/B (Firmicutes/Bacteroidota) ratio by 2.08-fold in high-fat diet mice, and the proportion was significantly inversely correlated with TC, TG, and LDL-C and positively correlated with HDL-C. Biomarker bacteria in the vinegar group included Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus, which correlated favorably with HDL-C, SOD, and GSH-Px and negatively with LDL-C, TC, and TG. Jujube vinegar increased the abundance of the Aerobic, Contains Mobile Elements, and Facultative Aerobic by 2.84 times, 1.45 times, and 2.40 times, while decreased the abundance of Potential pathogens by 44.72%, according to the BugBase study. The KEGG analysis showed that jujube vinegar was predominantly reflected in the biological process of gene function and related to signal transduction pathways, including glucagon signaling system, HIF-1 signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, amino sugar, and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and so forth. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, jujube vinegar may reduce hyperlipoidemia by controlling the gut microbiome and enhancing antioxidant capacity."

Three variants of pork hams were produced: S1-ham with curing salt, without apple vinegar; S2-ham with curing salt and 5% apple vinegar; S3-ham with salt and 5% apple vinegar. The tests were carried out immediately after production, after 7 and 14 days of storage. The products did not differ significantly in their chemical composition, salt content, fatty acid composition, and water activity (p > 0.05). During storage, a significant increase in the cholesterol content was observed (64.88-72.38 mg/100 g of the product). The lowest levels of nitrites and nitrates were recorded for treatment S3 (<0.10 and 4.73 mg/kg of product, respectively). The samples with the addition of apple vinegar (S2 and S3) were characterized by a lower pH value, higher oxidation-reduction potential, and TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances). Hams S3 were significantly brighter (L* 68.89) and less red (a* 12.98). All of the tested pork hams were characterized by very good microbiological quality (total number of microorganisms, number of lactic acid bacteria, number of acetic bacteria, number or presence of pathogenic bacteria). Significantly the lowest TVC (total viable counts) was found in the ham S3 (2.29 log CFU/g after 14 days). The S3 hams during storage were characterized by greater juiciness (6.94 c.u.) and overall quality (7.88 c.u.), but a lower intensity of smell and taste than the cured ham (S1). To sum up, it is possible to produce pork hams without the addition of curing salt, using natural apple vinegar as a marinade. Apple vinegar has a positive effect on the storage stability of the products, without losing their sensory properties."

Concentrations from 5-30 μg/ml could dissolve calcium oxalate (p < 0.05) in vitro. The IC50 value of ACV in DPPH was found to be around 7 μg/ml and the IC50 value of the ACV in ABTS assay was around 9 μg/ml. Different phytocompounds were obtained from GC-MS analysis. ACV can be consumed to prevent kidney stones which seems helpful to the current therapy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial was performed on 42 patients with rural skin leishmaniasis. In the case group, in addition to injecting glucantime into the lesion according to the latest national instructions, a combination of P. ovata and vinegar was applied topically twice a day for 8 weeks. In the control group, only glucantime injection into the lesion was performed for 8 weeks according to the latest national guidelines. At the end of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after the intervention, the lesion area and improvement were evaluated and recorded. RESULTS: The results of the present study indicated the lesion area in the case group with the mean of 0.35 ± 0.39 cm and 0.18 ± 0.27 cm in the 8th and 12th weeks, respectively was significantly less than that of the control group with the mean of 0.64 ± 0.78 cm and 0.56 ± 0.44, respectively (P < 0.05). Twelve weeks after the intervention, 84.1% of the lesions in the case group and 65.9% of the lesions in the control group were completely improved (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, the improvement of leishmaniasis lesion with the topical application of the combination of P. ovata and vinegar was significantly more than that of the control group in the 8th and 12th weeks after the intervention."

Thus, the efficacy and safety of Terminalia chebula Retz. fruit powder mixed with vinegar was compared with terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream in the treatment of tinea corporis in order to establish the non-inferiority of test drugs. METHODS: The primary outcome measures were change in the presence or absence of hyphae on KOH mount test, change in pruritus severity assessed on 100 mm VAS and change in physician's global assessment. Secondary outcome measure was change in the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). Hemograms, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, and random blood sugar levels were measured at the baseline and after treatment to ensure the safety of the interventions. RESULTS: A per-protocol analysis was done on 40 participants (21 in the test group and 19 in the control group). The observed differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between the test and control groups were greater than the non-inferiority margin, signifying that the test drugs were not inferior. CONCLUSIONS: It may be inferred that the trial drug Terminalia chebula Retz. fruit powder mixed with vinegar is not inferior to terbinafine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of tinea corporis.",

METHODS: The microorganisms used in this study were Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sobrinus (S. sobrinus), Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), Candida albicans (C. albicans), and Candida glabrata (C. glabrata). The antimicrobial activity of novel vinegar solution was evaluated by time kill assay and biofilm grown on denture base. RESULTS: Time kill assay showed that vinegar exhibited the highest antibacterial effect on S. sobrinus, S. sanguinis, and S. mutans after 15 min of treatment. A 99.9% reduction in C. glabrata and C. albicans required more than 4 and 6 h of treatment, respectively. Vinegar significantly inhibited streptococcal biofilm, with an approximately 6 log-reduction at 30 min of treatment. The results demonstrated that viable Candida cells in biofilm reduced in excess of 6-log CFU/mL after 3 h treatment with vinegar. Moreover, the vinegar-based denture cleanser inhibited bacterial and Candida biofilm formation compared to the control group without treatment with statistical significance. CONCLUSION: A novel vinegar-based denture cleansing agent showed moderate antibacterial properties, but required a slightly longer immersion time to attain anticandidal effects compared to Polident and 0.2% CHX.",

Wood vinegar, formed by the condensation of smoke produced during biochar production, has been shown to promote plant growth and enhance stress tolerance. They have now been recognized as a sustainable alternative and are frequently used exogenously to support plants coping with environmental stress. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of oil palm wood vinegar (OPWV) in mitigating the adverse effects of drought stress on Pandanus amaryllifolius. The optimal concentrations and frequencies of OPWV application were determined before the drought treatment. The results showed that the imposed drought stress negatively affected the plant growth parameters but applying OPWV at 1:500 dilution at 3-day intervals for 12 days increased its tolerance. These include increased leaf relative water content, root-to-shoot ratio, relative stem circumference, chlorophyll pigments and antioxidant enzyme activities. In contrast, the drought-stressed plants treated with OPWV showed decreased relative electrolyte leakage, hydrogen peroxide, proline, malondialdehyde, and enhanced drought-responsive gene expressions, such as HSP70, GAPDH, and Thau, while ENO and β-Fruc were reduced. These biostimulatory effects of OPWV might be due to several antioxidant compounds, such as anthranilic acid, tetrasiloxane, syringol, guaiacol, and catechol. Altogether, our results showed the effectiveness of OPWV in alleviating the adverse effects of drought stress, and as such, OPWV could be potentially applied in agriculture."

This study aimed to evaluate the anti-leishmanial effect of topical Plantago psyllium and white vinegar in L. major infected BALB/c mice. METHODS: Thirty infected mice were divided into five groups as follows: Group 1: treated with the combination of ovata powder and white vinegar, Group 2: treated with glucantime, Group 3: treated with white vinegar, Group 4: treated with the combination of ovata powder and water, and Group 5: without any treatment. All the groups were treated for 18 days. Lesion size was measured, and final smears were prepared for microscopic examination. RESULTS: The findings indicated that the difference in the mean areas of the ulcers in all the groups before and after treatment was not significant, except for the second (glucantime) and third (vinegar) groups. Also, the results showed that in the first, second, third, and fourth group, 6 (60%), 4 (80%), 3 (60%), and 2 (40%) mice were healed, respectively. However, ulcers remained in all the five mice of the control group. CONCLUSION: The combination of ovata powder and white vinegar has been traditionally used to treat leishmanial lesions in Iran. It seems the most anti-leishmanial effect is related to vinegar and supported by Plantago. The route of treatment with this combination is very simple and painless in comparison with injection. Thus, further studies on this issue could help to design more effective and easy-to-use drugs."

      "abstract": "To investigate the effect of Rosa roxburghii Tratt fruit vinegar (RFV) on the intervention of obesity and hyperlipidemia and its potential mechanism, a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model in mice was established and gavaged with RFV, saline and xuezhikang for 30 consecutive days, respectively. The results showed that RFV supplementation significantly reduced fat accumulation, and improved dyslipidemia and liver inflammation in HFD mice. RFV intervention for 30 days significantly improved the diversity of gut microbiota and altered the structure of gut microbiota in HFD mice. Compared with the model group (MC), the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes at least decreased by 15.75% after RFV treatment, and increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroides, Akkermansia,) and decreased the relative abundance of harmful bacteria (Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae _UCG-013, Lachnospiraceae, Allobaculum, Actinobacteria). Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed that Erysipelotrichaceae, Allobaculum, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013, uncultured_bacterium_f_Lachnospiraceae and Desulfobacterota were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with the body weight of mice, while Proteobacteria was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with the body weight of mice. The two main bacteria that could promote dyslipidemia in obese mice were Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, while those that played a mitigating role were mainly Bacteroidetes. It is concluded that RFV plays an important role in the intervention of obesity and related complications in HFD mice by regulating their gut microbiota."

Conventional antibiotics used for treating CRE have become ineffective due to resistance development. Furthermore, their safety issues restrict their availability and use for CRE treatment. Therefore, developing new drugs different from existing drugs to combat this deadly menace is urgently needed. Probiotics can be a potential option in this context, as probiotics' efficacy against a variety of infectious illnesses has already been well established. Here, we report the effect of the Bacillus velezensis strain isolated from Gochang Bokbunja vinegar in Korea on CRE infection using two mouse models. Data showed that pretreatment with B. velezensis significantly reduced body weight loss and mortality of CRKP-infected mice in the preventive model. The oral administration of B. velezensis in a therapeutic model also decreased the mortality and illness severity in CRKP-infected mice. Moreover, a two-week oral acute toxicity assay in guinea pigs did not reveal any aberrant clinical signs. Our findings demonstrate the potential effectiveness of our candidate probiotic strain, B. velezensis, against CRKP, suggesting that it could be used as an antimicrobial agent for treating CRKP-related infections.",

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults of >19 years, who were diagnosed with unexplained fatigue for at least 1 month. Eighty participants were randomly assigned to receive daily 70 mL of fermented PV (2.56 mg/g, chlorogenic acid, and 15.3 mg/g, citric acid) or a placebo for 8 weeks. At baseline and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment, the participants were visited for blood tests (liver enzyme, glucose, creatinine, lactate, malondialdehyde [MDA], and creatine kinase [CK]) and questionnaires (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS], fatigue visual analog scale [VAS], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], the Korean version of the Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument [BEPSI-K], EQ-5D-3L, and EQ-VAS]). RESULTS: Fermented PV supplementation for 8 weeks did not remarkably improve the fatigue indices when compared to placebo. Additionally, differences in fatigue VAS, BDI, BEPSI-K, EQ-5D-3L, EQ-VAS, lactate, CK, and MDA concentrations between the groups were not observed. However, FSS had positively correlated with fatigue VAS, BDI, and BEPSI-K, whereas it was negatively correlated with EQ-5D-3L and EQ-VAS at the baseline and 8 weeks. None of the participants reported adverse events. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of fermented PV did not exceed the efficacy of placebo in adults with unexplained fatigue.

This study aimed to evaluate the addition of biochar (B) and wood vinegar (WV) to reduce GHGs emissions and improve nitrogen retention and microbial activities during PM composting. Different treatments, carried out under a 1:2 ratio (dry weight) of PM and sawdust mixture with the addition of B (5%) and various proportions of WV, include a control treatment (CT) without the addition of B and WV and, B, B+0.5%WV, B+1.0%WV, B+1.5%WV, and B+2.0%WV treatments. The results indicated that the addition of B could accelerate the composting process in contrast to CT. In addition, various amounts of WV with B decreased NH3, CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions by 18.82-35.88%, 1.38-15.39%, 16.98-62.73%, and 4.47-19.91%, respectively. Furthermore, in contrast to the B treatment, WV addition was more effective in decreasing GHGs and NH3 emissions, and the B+1.0% WV treatment displayed the lowest nitrogen loss (2.12%) and GHGs emissions (11.62 g/kg). The bacterial community analysis demonstrated that synergistic application of WV and B can increase the relative abundance of Proteobacteria which can contribute to nitrogen fixation and reduction of nitrogen loss. The results proved that combining B with WV can be a feasible strategy to effectively reduce GHGs emissions and improve nitrogen conservation in the composting industry.",

[Zingiberaceae] (CAS) are traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that have long been used to treat gynecological blood stasis syndrome such as primary dysmenorrhea. The mechanisms and active substances of CAS are still largely unknown. The study aimed to establish a rat model of primary dysmenorrhea which investigates the differences between the pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of raw CAS (RCAS) and vinegar-processed CAS (VCAS). Histopathology, cytokinetics, and metabolomics were adopted to evaluate the anti-blood stasis effect of RCAS and VCAS. In metabolomics, endogenous differential metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces are the essential steps to evaluate the effect of RCAS and VCAS. In this study, the rat model of primary dysmenorrhea was successfully established. After RCAS and VCAS intervention, the uterine tissue morphology of dysmenorrhea model rats was improved, and gland hypertrophy and myometrial hyperplasia were reduced as well as neutrophil content. Compared with the RCAS group, the VCAS group had better uterine morphology, few inflammatory factors, and significantly improved amino acid and lipid metabolism. The aforementioned results support the conclusion that VCAS performed better than RCAS in primary dysmenorrhea and that vinegar processing increases the efficacy of CAS."

      "abstract": "Thousands of years of historical practice have proven that the ancient Chinese food, vinegar-egg juice, has immune-boosting effects with the presence of many nutritional factors. However, its mechanism of action in the body remains unclear. In this research project, vinegar-egg juice was chosen to analyze its immune-enhancing effects on mice. The immune enhancing effects of egg, vinegar and vinegar egg juice on lymphocytes of mouse spleen were compared. The effects on immune function of mice were analyzed by studying the organ index, natural killer(NK) cell activity, lymphocyte transformation function and cytokine changes in immune organs after treatment with vinegar-egg juice. The mechanism of immune enhancement was speculated by analyzing the changes of total IKKα/β/IκBα/NF-κB and its phosphorylated protein kinase by Western blot. Experiments have shown that vinegar and eggs have less immune regulation than vinegar-egg juice. Vinegar-egg juice can regulate the cellular and humoral immunity of spleen lymphocytes, increase the phosphorylated kinases of IKKα/β, reduce the total protein expression of IκBα, and activate the signaling pathway of IKK/IκB/NF-κB. In addition, compared with the control group, vinegar-egg juice reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. Furthermore, vinegar-egg juice can raise phosphatidylserine (PS) and serotonin (5-HT) levels in the body. The results showed that the vinegar-egg juice had obvious immunomodulatory activity. It was speculated that the intake of vinegar-egg juice can increase the activity of NK cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes by increasing 5-HT levels, ultimately enhancing the body's immune function. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this work, we evaluated the immune regulation of vinegar, egg and vinegar-egg juice in mice. In addition, we investigated the effects of vinegar-egg juice on gut microbiota. And combined with the composition of the vinegar-egg juice, it was found that the intake of vinegar-egg juice could increase the activity of NK cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes by increasing 5-HT levels, ultimately enhancing the body's immune function. On the basis of the results of this study, we recommend vinegar-egg juice can be a potential health food to resist the epidemic and improve autoimmunity in special times of the novel coronavirus outbreak.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are controversial findings regarding the effect of vinegar on blood pressure based on the evidence accumulated so far. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted through PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science up to April 2022. We estimated the change in blood pressure for each 30 ml/d increments in vinegar consumption in each trial and then, calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95 %CI using a fixed-effects model. A dose-response meta-analysis of differences in means provided us with the estimation of the dose-dependent effect. The certainty of evidence was rated by the GRADE tool. RESULTS: Each 30 ml/d increment in vinegar consumption reduced SBP by - 3.25 mmHg (95 %CI: - 5.54, - 0.96; I2 = 67.5 %, GRADE = low). Levels of SBP decreased linearly and slightly (Pnonlinearity = 0.69, Pdose-response = 0.02) up to vinegar consumption of 30 ml/d (MD30 ml/d: - 3.36, 95 %CI: - 5.77, - 0.94). Each 30 ml/d increment in vinegar consumption reduced DBP by - 3.33 mmHg (95 %CI: - 4.16, - 2.49; I2 = 57.1 %, GRADE = low). Levels of DBP decreased linearly and slightly (Pnonlinearity = 0.47, Pdose-response = 0.004) up to vinegar consumption of 30 ml/d (MD30 ml/d: - 2.61, 95 %CI: - 4.15, - 1.06) CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings, vinegar significantly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure and may be considered an adjunct to hypertension treatment. Thus, clinicians could incorporate vinegar consumption as part of their dietary advice for patients.",

      "abstract": "Background This study was designed to evaluate the effect of apple cider vinegar (ACV) 5% and mechanical plaque removal with a manual toothbrush on dental plaque and gingivitis. The objective was to study available, natural, and inexpensive ways to improve oral health status among the studied group. Materials and methods A randomized clinical trial was performed on 50 children with cerebral palsy aged from three to six years. Participants were divided into two groups (n=25, apple cider vinegar, manual brushing without toothpaste). Plaque accumulation and gingival status were evaluated using Turesky of the Quigley-Hein plaque index (TQHPI) and modified gingival index (MGI) seven times: pre-intervention baseline (T0), post-intervention at one month (T1), two months (T2), three months (T3), four months (T4), five months (T5), six months (T6). Results Plaque accumulation and gingivitis decreased significantly for the ACV group between T0 and T6 (p<0.05) and demonstrated significantly lower plaque accumulation and gingivitis compared to the manual brushing group (p<0.05) at T5 and T6. The manual brushing group showed decreasing in TQHPI between T0 and T3, then TQHPI increased significantly (p<0.05) at T4, T5, and T6. Conclusions To sum up, this in vitro study has demonstrated the possibility of using apple cider vinegar to reduce plaque and gingivitis. In addition, without additives, apple cider vinegar has both mechanical and chemical effects on dental plaque, and it may be a natural, available, inexpensive, and harmless substance that can improve the quality of oral care for difficult groups of children and people with special needs. Unlike toothbrushes, especially electric toothbrushes, they are effective, but they may be expensive and not available to all children."

The bacteria were isolated from grapevine berries and vinegar produced in the cottage industry. Following phenotype and genotype identification, the AAB were ascribed to the genera Acetobacter, Gluconobacter, and Komagataeibacter. A mixture of selected AAB was tested as an inoculum for vinegar production in bench fermenters, under different conditions and substrates, namely, grapes, honey, figs, onions, prickly pear, and tomatoes. The bench fermenters were operated under semi-continuous fermentation where working volumes were maintained by discharging and subsequent recharging accordingly to maintain the acidity in fermenters by adding 30-50 g/l of acetic acid for optimal Acetobacteraceae performance. Finally, the vinegar products obtained from the different substrates were evaluated for their quality, including organoleptic properties, which showed the superior quality of wood-treated vinegar samples with respect to neat vinegar samples."

In this study, traditionally produced vinegar made from gilaburu fruit (C-GV) was evaluated. Vinegar with higher levels of bioactive components optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) was also produced using ultrasound (UT-GV). The maximum optimization result for the bioactive components was achieved at 14 min and 61.2 amplitude. The effectiveness of thermal pasteurization (P-GV) on gilaburu vinegar was evaluated. An increase was detected for every organic acid with ultrasound treatment. In the UT-GV and C-GV samples, arabinose was present, which is useful for stimulating the immune system. Gilaburu vinegar samples contained 29-31 volatile compounds. The smallest amount of volatile compounds was found in P-GV (1280.9 µg/kg), and the largest amounts of volatile compounds were found in C-GV (1566.9 µg/kg) and UT-GV (1244.10 µg/kg). In the UT-GV sample, Fe was increased, but Ca, K, Mg, and Mn were decreased. A total of 15 polyphenols were detected in C-GV, P-GV, and UT-GV samples, and gallic acid was the most common. A total of 17 free amino acids were detected in gilaburu vinegar samples. Ultrasound provided enrichment in total phenolic compounds and total free amino acids. All three vinegar samples had good antimicrobial activity against pathogens. The efficacy of C-GV, P-GV, and UT-GV samples against colon and stomach cancer was determined, but there were no significant differences between them. As a result, ultrasound treatment is notable due to its antimicrobial and anticancer activity, especially for the enrichment of phenolic compounds and amino acids in gilaburu vinegar."

      "abstract": "The present study explored the effective components, functional targets, and mechanism of Sparganii Rhizoma(vinegar-processed Sparganii Rhizoma) in the treatment of hyperlipidemia based on network pharmacology and experimental verification. In the network pharmacology, the screening of active components, target prediction, and pathway enrichment analysis of Sparganii Rhizoma were carried out, followed by the comparison with targets and pathways related to hyperlipidemia. In the experimental verification, the hyperlipidemia model in rats was induced to detect hemorheological parameters and coagulation function. The liver index was observed by HE staining, and PCR technology was used to verify the results of the network pharmacological analysis. Compared with the model group, the Sparganii Rhizoma and vinegar-processed Sparganii Rhizoma groups showed decreased liver index(P&lt;0.05), reduced liver lipid deposition, dwindled serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-c) level(P&lt;0.05), diminished blood viscosity, and increased prothrombin time(PT), thrombin time(TT), and activated partial thrombin time(APTT)(P&lt;0.05). As revealed by the PCR assay, Sparganii Rhizoma could affect LDL-c and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-c) levels and reduce the inhibitory effect of cholesterol ester transporter by regulating the expression of Apol2, Apof, and Stab2, thereby treating hyperlipidemia. Vinegar-processed Sparganii Rhizoma could enhance triglyceride metabolism and cholesterol reversal by regulating the expression of Hmgcr, Hmgcs2, Abca1, Abcg1, Cyp7 b1, and Stab2. Compared with the Sparganii Rhizoma, the vinegar-processed one was potent in treating hyperlipidemia. The active components of Sparganii Rhizoma in the treatment of hyperlipidemia may be L-alpha-palmitin,(1S,2S)-1,2-bis(2-furyl)ethane-1,2-diol, cis-zimtsaeure, o-acetyl-p-cresol, sanleng, and 9-hexadecenoic acid. Based on the network pharmacology and experimental verification, this study preliminarily explored the potential active components and possible mechanism of Sparganii Rhizoma in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, which is expected to provide a certain basis for in-depth research on active components, mechanism, and clinical application.",

Seven-week-old KM female mice were divided into five treatment groups: (1) Normal control (NC) group, (2) high fat diet (HFD) group, (3) low concentration treatment group (3.5% COV), (4) medium concentration treatment group (5.0% COV), and (5) high concentration treatment group (6.5% COV). Mice in the NC group were fed with a normal chow diet, and those in the other four groups were fed with a HFD known for causing obesity for 10 weeks. Then, mice in the three COV treatment groups were orally administered with COV once a day for 6 weeks. Results showed that the contents of loganin and morroniside in COV reached 16.82 and 51.17 µg/ml, respectively, and COV also contained multiple organic acids. COV significantly reduced BW, abdominal fat weight, liver weight, and the levels of glucose, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of serum and increased the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of serum (p < 0.05). COV also improved the liver function and anti-oxidant activity of liver (p < 0.05). COV treatments increased the interleukin-10 expression and reduced the tumor necrosis factor-α expression in the liver tissue of NAFLD mice (p < 0.05). Histopathological observation revealed that COV suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and steatosis. The results suggest that COV may contribute to the alleviation of NAFLD and obesity.",

      "abstract": "The present study evaluated the effect of mulberry vinegar (MV) on the regulation of the inflammatory responses using C6 glial cells. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced the nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species generation, while pre-incubation with MV inhibited these formations in a concentration-dependent manner. MV treatment also decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in C6 glial cells stimulated by LPS/IFN-γ. Compared to the LPS/IFN-γ-treated control group, the MV-treated group exerts downregulation in the protein expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, through inhibition of nuclear factor-κB activation. Protein expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 were also decreased in the MV-treated group. These findings suggest that MV prevents neuroinflammation by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway and glial activation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Mulberry fruits (Morus alba L.) have been commonly consumed as juice or jam. It is a rich source of anthocyanins that might be associated with beneficial effects on human health, including the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, and anti-diabetic effects. Mulberry vinegar was produced by alcohol and acetic fermentation of mulberry juice, and they possessed a protective effect against LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated inflammatory responses in glial cells via regulation of glial activation and NF-κB signaling pathway (i.e., downregulation of iNOS, COX-2, TLR4, p-IκB, and NF-κB p65 protein expressions). Although further research especially animal and clinical trials are still necessary, the present study will be helpful to scale-up the production of functional vinegar with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties using mulberry.",

      "abstract": "Utilizing metabolomics technology, this study explored the change of fecal endogenous metabolites in Walker-256 rats with malignant ascites after the administration with Kansui Radix(KR) stir-fried with vinegar(VKR), sought the potential biomarkers in feces which were related to the treatment of malignant ascites by VKR and revealed the biological mechanism of water-expelling effect of VKR. Ultra-fast liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UFLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed to detect the feces of rats in all groups. Principle component analysis(PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis(PLS-DA) were conducted to achieve pattern recognition. Combining t-test and variable importance in the projection(VIP) enabled the screening of potential biomarkers for the malignant ascites. Metabolic pathway analysis was accomplished with MetaboAnalyst. Correlation analysis was finally conducted integrating the sequencing data of gut microbiota to elucidate the mechanism underlying the water-expelling effect of VKR. The results showed that both KR and VKR could restore the abnormal metabolism of model rats to some extent, with VKR being inferior to KR in the regulation. Eleven potential biomarkers were identified to be correlated with the malignant ascites and five metabolic pathways were then enriched. Four kinds of gut microbiota were significantly related to the potential biomarkers. The water-expelling effect of VKR may be associated with the regulation of phenylalanine metabolism, biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan, tryptophan metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchor biosynthesis. This study can provide a scientific basis for comprehensive understandings of the interaction between gut microbiota and host which has relation to the water-expelling effect of VKR and guide the reasonable clinical application of VKR.",

      "abstract": "Acetic acid has been proposed to improve lifestyle-related diseases, including hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. This study compared the hypoglycemic and hypolipogenic effects of acetic acid vinegar (AV, contains only 4% acetic acid) and Monascus-fermented grain vinegar (MV) containing various bioactive compounds in 3T3L1 cells and C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice (DB). The DB were divided randomly into three treatment groups containing nine mice each; DB-, AV-, and MV-groups were orally administered 1 mL/kg/day of distilled water, acetic acid vinegar, and Monascus vinegar, respectively, for 8 weeks. Exposure to AV and MV inhibited the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3L1 preadipocytes and lipid accumulation during differentiation. Oral administration of AV or MV to the mice resulted in a marked reduction in the body weight, liver weight, and hepatic triglyceride content compared to the control DB-group. Moreover, treatment with AV and MV clearly increased the expression of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and suppressed the expression of fatty acid synthetase in liver tissues of DB. Significantly, lower levels of fasting blood glucose, insulin, leptin, and the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as well as higher levels of the skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression were obtained in the AV- or MV-groups than levels determined in the control DB-group (P < .05). Although MV has the potential to be a natural alternative treatment for obesity-associated type 2 diabetes, this study suggests that acetic acid is the central ingredient in MV responsible for the hypoglycemic and hypolipogenic effects in the DB mice.",

In vitro, phenolic and flavonoid content and antioxidant activity were determined. In vivo, phenylhydrazine (10 mg/kg) was injected intravenously into rats for 4 days and then treated with apple vinegar daily by gavage (1 mL/kg) for five weeks. high level of polyphenols and flavonoids (90 ± 1.66 mg GAE/100 mL and 7.29 ± 0.23 mg QE/100 mL, respectively) were found in the apple vinegar which gives it a good ability to scavenge free radicals (TAC = 4.22 ± 0.18 mg AAE/100 mL and DPPH, IC50 = 0.49 ± 0.004 µL/ml). The phytochemical composition of apple vinegar revealed the presence of numerous bioactive compounds including arbutin, apigenin, sinapic, ferulic and trans-ferulic acids. The major antioxidant components in apple vinegar were ferulic and trans-ferulic acids (40% and 43%, respectively). PHZ treatment induced changes in platelets, blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin concentration and mean capsulated hemoglobin. However, the co-administration of apple vinegar revealed its capacity to ameliorate the changes induced by phenylhydrazine. Therefore, apple vinegar use could have a positive impact on the prevention of hemolytic anemia induced by phenylhydrazine due to the antioxidant properties of its major components."

In the study, the effect of three different levels (0%, 0.5% and 1%) of apple vinegar (AV) and sodium diacetate (SDA) supplementation to fermented HMM at two different storage conditions (27-29 °C, 48% Humidity; 35-37 °C, 26% Humidity) were investigated. The material of the study was fermented rolled maize grain with 62% moisture content stored for about 120 days. Silage samples were subjected to aerobic stability test with three replicates for each treatment group. Wendee and microbiological analyses were made at 0, 2, 4, 7, and 12 days. Meanwhile, samples were displayed in the T200 IR brand thermal camera. According to the thermogram results, 1% SDA addition positively affected HMM silages at the second and fourth days of aerobic stability at both storage conditions (p < 0.05). Aerobic stability and infrared thermography analysis indicated that 1% AV, 0.5%, and 1% SDA additions to HMM silages had promising effects. Due to our results, we concluded that thermal camera images might be used as an alternative quality indicator for silages in laboratory conditions.",

It has been used as Chinese traditional medicine, while its composition and function are reported minimally. In this study, we measured CVS in terms of saccharide, protein, fat and water content, and polyphenol and flavonoid content. Furthermore, we determined the amino acids, organic acids, and other soluble metabolites in CVS using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), HPLC, and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platforms. The hepatoprotective effect of CVS was evaluated in acute CCl4-induced liver injury mice. Administration of CVS for 7 days prior to the CCl4 treatment can significantly decrease liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, compared with those in the hepatic injury model group. The gut microbiota was changed by CCl4 administration and was partly shifted by the pretreatment of CVS, particularly the Muribaculaceae family, which was increased in CVS-treated groups compared with that in the CCl4 administration group. Moreover, the abundances of Alistipes genus and Muribaculaceae family were correlated with the liver ALT, AST, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Our results illustrated the composition of CVS and its hepatoprotective effect in mice, suggested that CVS could be developed as functional food to prevent acute liver injury."

      "abstract": "A better understanding how to modulate alkaline soil-plant systems with lead (Pb) toxicity with by vinegar residue biochar is important for the remediation of Pb-contaminated soil. Leaching column and pot experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of vinegar residue biochar on Pb speciation, soil properties, and plant growth under Pb stress. The results indicate that biochar could effectively decrease the exchangeable and carbonated-bound Pb but increase the Fe-Mn oxide and residue fractions in the soil with Pb at 500 mg kg-1. Biochar did not effectively immobilize Pb in the soil with Pb at 1000 mg kg-1. After leaching, biochar evidently increased the organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon content of the soil, but slightly affected the pH, cation exchange capacity and carbonate content. The biochar addition at 0.5% had no significant effect on soil aggregates, and biochar at 2.0% and 5.0% significantly decreased soil aggregate stability. The dry weight and soluble protein content of pak choi (Brassica chinensis L.) increased with biochar treatment. Lead assimilation by plants was inhibited by the decreased availability of Pb in biochar-treated soils. Soil enzymes activities also significantly increased, then facilitated biochemical reactions in the soil environment. The applied biochar has shown an important role in mitigating Pb toxicity by increasing the soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon content, enzyme activities, and plant growth. The low dose biochar (0.5-2.0%) are recommended as references for subsequent experiments, especially in alkaline loam soil.",

Participants were randomized to the vinegar group (VIN: n = 14; 1.5 g acetic acid/day as liquid vinegar) or the control group (CON: n = 11; 0.015 g acetic acid/day as a pill) with no change to customary diet or physical activity. At baseline and at study week four, participants completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) questionnaires and provided a first-morning urine sample for targeted metabolomics analyses. The change in both POMS depression scores and CES-D scores differed significantly between groups favoring improved affect in the VIN versus CON participants after four weeks. Metabolomics analyses pre and post-intervention suggested metabolite alterations associated with vinegar ingestion that are consistent for improved mood, including enzymatic dysfunction in the hexosamine pathway as well as significant increases in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. These data warrant continued investigation of vinegar as a possible agent to improve mood state.",

A total of 300 broilers (Arbor Acre) were randomized to six treatments replicated 5 times (50 birds/treatment and 10 birds/replicate) from 2 days old till the sixth week of age in a 2 by 3 factorial layout consisting of dosages (5.0 mL/L and 10.0 mL/L ACV) and administration frequency (antibiotics following standard schedule, twice/week ACV and thrice/week ACV). At the sixth week, sixty birds (10 birds/treatment) were selected for carcass yield, cut part yield, organ weight, meat technological properties, lipid profiles, and malondialdehyde (MDA) level evaluation. Data obtained were subjected to two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test at a P < 0.05 significant level. Birds administered 5.0 mL/L ACV thrice weekly presented a significantly (P < 0.05) higher plucked, eviscerated, dressed, thigh and breast weight compared with the other treatments. The spleen of birds in the control group was significantly (P < 0.05) heavier than those administered ACV. The meat from the 5.0 mL/L ACV group had significantly higher (P < 0.05) water absorptive power and lower refrigeration loss, as depicted in the main effect table. Meat cholesterol, phospholipids, and MDA levels did not differ across the treatments except triglyceride, which was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the 5.0 mL/L ACV thrice-weekly group. This study concludes that ACV administration could improve carcass yield and meat quality indices. Thus, its use as an alternative to conventional antibiotics for broiler chickens might be beneficial.",

      "abstract": "Macrophages are essential for host defense as they control foreign pathogens and induce acquired immune responses. Activated macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory reactive substances causing local cell and tissue inflammatory response, which helps an organism resist the invasion of foreign pathogens. Excessive or chronic inflammation can cause several diseases. Previous studies have reported that vinegar treatment decreases the levels of several inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitric oxide (NO). However, the benefits of wood vinegar produced from Griffith's ash (Fraxinus formosana Hayata) in reducing inflammation have not been investigated yet. Thus, assuming that wood vinegar exerts anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages, in this study, we investigated the potential anti-inflammatory effects of the wood vinegar from Griffith's ash using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response model in RAW264.7 macrophages. We showed that the wood vinegar inhibited the production of iNOS, NO, and interleukin 6. In addition, we found that the wood vinegar reduced the phosphorylation levels of p38 and protein kinase C-α/δ in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Based on these results, we suggest that the produced wood vinegar can reduce inflammation in LPS-activated macrophages.",

The ANN model has higher prediction accuracy than RSM. The microstructure, microbiological properties, sensory analysis, ACE (angiotensin-converting-enzyme) inhibitor and antidiabetic effects of the ultrasound-treated tomato vinegar (UTV) (8.9 min and 74.5 amplitude), traditional tomato vinegar (TTV) and pasteurized tomato vinegar (PTV) samples were then evaluated. UTV was generally appreciated by the panelists. It was determined that the microbiological properties were affected by the ultrasound treatment. UTV was found to have more effective ACE inhibitor and antidiabetic properties than other vinegar samples. As a result, the bioactive components of tomato vinegar were enriched with ultrasound treatment and positive effects on health were determined."

Therefore, it is desirable to accelerate the process and obtain products with the same flavour profile. Here, we used physical interventions (ultrasonic field, alternating magnetic field, or combination of both) to assist the aging process with naturally brewed vinegar as a case example. Flavour profiles of different physical-assisted aging process were compared with that of the naturally aged vinegar by using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and electronic nose. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson correlation analyses show that ultrasonic and alternating magnetic fields treatment could accelerate the aging process of vinegar. The highest accelerating aging effect was combination of ultrasonic and magnetic field followed by individual ultrasonic or magnetic field and natural process (combination of ultrasonic and magnetic field > ultrasonic or magnetic field individual > natural process). These results suggest that physical field intervention could potentially be used for acceleration of aging of fermented products without affecting flavour quality.",

It is important for dermatologists to understand the evidence supporting its use in skin disease, as well as potential adverse effects, so they can properly counsel patients on the safe use of this widely available treatment. Vinegar possesses antimicrobial and antioxidant properties that provide utility in wound care as well as bacterial and fungal infections. There is also evidence to support its use in pruritus, head lice removal, and treatment of striae gravidarum. While generally safe, inappropriate use can result in damage to the skin. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting vinegar as a treatment for skin disease, as well as adverse events reported from misuse, to provide dermatologists the knowledge to counsel patients on the safe and appropriate use of vinegar.",

This study was designed to examine the protective effect of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) on MAO and amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), non-adrenaline (NA) levels. METHOD: In this experiment, out of five groups, three groups of animals were pretreated with one of the test drugs each i.e., Chrysin (10 mg/kg), ACV (0.7% v/v) and Rivastigmine (2.5 mg/kg) along with Zn with high fat diet (HFD) for 3 months and the rest two groups were that of control and disease induced. After the treatment period, mice were examined for MAO-A & B, DA, 5-HT and NA level estimation. RESULTS: The results showed that Zn with HFD had induced a significant increase (p < 0.01, p < 0.001) in MAO-A & B levels and a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the levels of 5-HT, DA, and NA. Pretreatment of test drugs with Zn with HFD caused a restoration activity and a significant decrease (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) in MAO-A & B levels and a significant increase (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001) in the level of DA, 5HT and NA as compared to the Zn treated group. Amongst all three test drugs mentioned above, the ACV-treated group showed the most improvement during pretreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ACV, might prove to be a beneficial nutraceutical & provide a protective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurological diseases.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol induces inflammation and oxidative stress with the dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury. Melanoidins are known to exert an antioxidant effect, however, their function in inhibiting alcohol-induced inflammation is unclear. In this study, we examined the role of melanoidins from Chinese traditional vinegar powder in terms of their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in RAW 264.7 macrophages and elucidated their mechanisms of function. In macrophages, melanoidins significantly suppress the mRNA expression of interleukin (Il)-6, Il-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (Tnf-α) with a concomitant inhibitory effect on IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα secretion, which are increased by ethanol. In addition, ethanol significantly increases the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the expression of cytochrome β-245 and beta polypeptide (Cybb), which are repressed by melanoidins to basal level. However, the expression of genes related to oxidative stress significantly decreases in response to ethanol, while it is significantly increased by melanoidins. Importantly, treatment with ethanol led to significant decreases in SIRT1 and SIRT3 transcription, translation, and activation, as well as the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels. Interestingly, all the decreases were markedly attenuated by melanoidins. Ethanol promoted the expression of proinflammatory genes, whereas coincubation with resveratrol (a potent SIRT agonist) inhibited this effect. Conversely, the addition of sirtinol (a known SIRT inhibitor) augmented the proinflammatory gene expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that melanoidins exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions via abolishing decreases in SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression and cellular NAD+ levels in ethanol-induced macrophages and may serve as a new therapeutic agent for the prevention of alcohol-induced cell damage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated lipid profiles and impaired glucose homeostasis are risk factors for several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which, subsequently, represent a leading cause of early mortality, worldwide. The aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of apple cider vinegar (ACV) on lipid profiles and glycemic parameters in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases, including Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge, from database inception to January 2020. All clinical trials which investigated the effect of ACV on lipid profiles and glycemic indicators were included. Studies were excluded if ACV was used in combination with other interventions or when the duration of intervention was < 2 weeks. To account for between-study heterogeneity, we performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Overall, nine studies, including 10 study arms, were included in this meta-analysis. We found that ACV consumption significantly decreased serum total cholesterol (- 6.06 mg/dL; 95% CI: - 10.95, - 1.17; I2: 39%), fasting plasma glucose (- 7.97 mg/dL; 95% CI: - 13.74, - 2.21; I2: 75%), and HbA1C concentrations (- 0.50; 95% CI: - 0.90, - 0.09; I2: 91%). No significant effect of ACV consumption was found on serum LDL-C, HDL-C, fasting insulin concentrations, or HOMA-IR. The stratified analysis revealed a significant reduction of serum TC and TG in a subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes, those who took ≤15 mL/day of ACV, and those who consumed ACV for > 8-weeks, respectively. Furthermore, ACV consumption significantly decreased FPG levels in a subgroup of studies that administered ACV for > 8-weeks. Further, ACV intake appeared to elicit an increase in FPG and HDL-C concentrations in apparently healthy participants. CONCLUSION: We found a significant favorable effect of ACV consumption on FPG and blood lipid levels.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is the critical marker of neurological complications such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is known to have health benefits due to its antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and high antioxidant properties. Therefore, we hypothesized that regular consumption of ACV would protect against AD-like neurological diseases via inhibition of oxidative stress. Authors have compared the efficacy of ACV with that of Chrysin and Rivastigmine in cellular and animal studies. In the cellular study, oxidative stress was induced in Neuro2A cells (1 × 107 ) via H2 O2 (50 μM) treatment. Subsequently, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was performed, and cell viability, SOD, GSH, lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels were measured. Similarly, in the animal study, oxidative stress was introduced in Swiss albino mice (10-11 weeks old, 20-25 g, n = 30) via scopolamine (1 mg/kg). Subsequently, histopathological experiments were performed; cognitive ability, AChE activity, and SOD, GSH, and MDA levels were measured. The in vitro results indicated that ACV (2 μM) provided better protection than Chrysin and Rivstigmine in cell viability. ACV has also performed better in restoring the antioxidants markers (SOD, GSH levels) and reducing MDA and AChE levels. In the in vivo study, test compounds (ACV, Chrysin, and Rivastigmine) improved cognitive impairment, increased the SOD and GSH level, reduced the MDA level and AChE activity, and protected the cortex-hippocampal neurons from degeneration. Here also, ACV (0.7%) showed better neuroprotection than the other two compounds. Therefore, these results supported our hypothesis that moderate consumption of ACV might prove to be beneficial prophylaxis against AD-like neurological diseases.",

      "abstract": "Vascular endothelial injury (VEI) is an early event of atherosclerosis, and reversing endothelial dysfunction has become a new trend in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Hengshun aromatic vinegar (HSAV), a traditional vinegar, has been reported to have many pharmacological activities, but its effect against VEI and the molecular mechanism are still unknown. In this study, effects of HSAV on VEI were evaluated in H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and methionine-induced VEI in rats. Results showed that HSAV significantly increased cell viability, inhibited apoptosis, and reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H2O2-induced HUVECs. Meanwhile, HSAV decreased serum homocysteine (Hcy), endothelin 1 (ET-1), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) levels, increased nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels, ameliorated pathological changes in rats with VEI induced by methionine. In parallel, HSAV relieved oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) level and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels in rats with VEI. Mechanism studies indicated that HSAV markedly downregulated the expression of protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), and consequently regulated sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)-mediated oxidative stress signal pathway, and protein inhibitor of activated STATy (PIASy)-mediated apoptosis pathway, leading to the alleviation of oxidative stress and inhibition of apoptosis. These regulative effects of HSAV were further validated by knockdown and overexpression of PKCζ in vitro. In conclusion, HSAV showed protective effect against VEI by inhibiting PKCζ and, thereby, ameliorating oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis. This study not only provides guidance for the consumption of vinegar in daily life but also promotes the development of diet supplement for disease prevention."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis is a common skin disease characterized by altered cutaneous immunity in which patients often exhibit lower skin microbiota diversity compared to healthy skin and are prone to colonization by Staphylococcus aureus. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to have antibacterial effects; however, its effects on the skin microbiome have not previously been well-described. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the effects of topical dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on Staphylococcus aureus abundance, skin bacterial microbiome composition, and skin bacterial microbiome diversity in atopic dermatitis participants compared to healthy skin. METHODS: Eleven subjects with atopic dermatitis and 11 healthy controls were enrolled in this randomized, non-blinded, single-institution, split-arm pilot study. Subjects soaked one forearm in dilute apple cider vinegar (0.5% acetic acid) and the other forearm in tap water for 10 minutes daily. Skin bacteria samples were collected from subjects' volar forearms before and after 14 days of treatment. 16S sequencing was used to analyze Staphylococcus aureus abundance and skin bacterial microbiome composition, and alpha diversity of microbiota were determined using Shannon diversity index. RESULTS: There was no difference in skin bacterial microbiome in atopic dermatitis subjects after 2 weeks of daily water or apple cider vinegar treatments (p = 0.056 and p = 0.22, respectively), or in mean abundance of S. aureus on apple cider vinegar-treated forearms (p = 0.60). At 2 weeks, the skin bacterial microbiomes of healthy control subjects were not significantly different from the skin bacterial microbiome of atopic dermatitis subjects (p = 0.14, 0.21, 0.12, and 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that daily soaks in 0.5% apple cider vinegar are not an effective method of altering the skin bacterial microbiome in atopic dermatitis. Further studies are needed to explore the effects of different concentrations of apple cider vinegar on skin microflora and disease severity. TRIAL NUMBER: UVA IRB-HSR #19906.",

(Zingiberaceae), a Chinese herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the vinegar processing effects by evaluating anti-angiogenic effect and toxicity of C. phaeocaulis through zebrafish and rat models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zebrafish embryos (AB and FLk-GFP strain) were applied to evaluate toxicity, cardiotoxicity and anti-angiogenic activity of volatile oil, and water decoction of the raw and vinegar-processed C. phaeocaulis. Meanwhile, a blood stasis syndrome rat model was applied to study the toxicity by measuring the ovarian and uterine coefficient. RESULTS: Curcuma phaeocaulis volatile oil and its vinegar-processed products in zebrafish had an LC50 of 67.315 and 95.755 μg/mL, respectively. Curcuma phaeocaulis water decoction and its vinegar-processed products had an LC50 of 161.440 and 206.239 μg/mL, respectively. The toxicity of vinegar-processed products was significantly lower than the raw, and the development characteristic of zebrafish embryos at different times confirmed these results. The volatile oil of vinegar-processed products could inhibit the growth of intersegmental blood vessels at the dose of 20 μg/mL, while the raw materials did not exhibit such effect at the same concentration. The rat experiment also confirmed that the volatile oil could reduce toxicity of ovarian and uterine. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that processing using vinegar could decrease toxicity and increase anti-angiogenic activity of C. phaeocaulis, which could be applied for clinical treatment. Further in-depth study on the synergism and detoxification mechanism of vinegar processing technology is needed.",

HSAV shows multiple bioactivities, but its activity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and possible mechanisms have not been reported. In this study, the effects of HSAV against T2DM were evaluated in insulin-induced HepG2 cells and high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced T2DM rats. Then, the mechanisms of HSAV against T2DM were explored by Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence assays, siRNA transfection and gene overexpression experiments. Results indicated that HSAV significantly improved glucose consumption and reduced triglycerides (TG) contents in metabolic disordered HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, HSAV obviously alleviated general status, liver and kidney functions of T2DM rats, and decreased hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, improved insulin resistance, and reduced lipid accumulation in liver. Mechanism studies indicated that HSAV markedly down-regulated the expression of proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), then regulated peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α (PPAR-α)/protein kinase B (AKT) signal pathway mediated gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis. Meanwhile, HSAV significantly up-regulated proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1β (PGC-1β), and subsequently decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) pathway mediated lipogenesis. In conclusion, HSAV showed potent anti-T2DM activity in ameliorating dysfunction of glycolipid metabolism through regulating PGC-1α/PGC-1β pathway, which has a certain application prospect as an effective diet supplement for T2DM therapy in the future."

It is widely accepted that healthcare workers should have high priority. However, questions have been raised about what we ought to do if members of priority groups refuse vaccination. Using the case of influenza vaccination as a comparison, we know that coercive approaches to vaccination uptake effectively increase vaccination rates among healthcare workers and reduce patient morbidity if properly implemented. Using the principle of least restrictive alternative, we have developed an intervention ladder for COVID-19 vaccination policies among healthcare workers. We argue that healthcare workers refusing vaccination without a medical reason should be temporarily redeployed and, if their refusal persists after the redeployment period, eventually suspended, in order to reduce the risk to their colleagues and patients. This 'conditional' policy is a compromise between entirely voluntary or entirely mandatory policies for healthcare workers, and is consistent with healthcare workers' established professional, legal and ethical obligations to their patients and to society at large."

      "abstract": "The current research aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary inclusion of wood vinegar on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and meat quality of grower-finisher pigs. In total, 132 crossbred ({Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc}) grower-finisher pigs with an initial average body weight 30.48±4.23 kg (11 replications/treatment; 4 pigs/pen) were used in a 16-week trial. Based on the body weight and sex the pigs were randomly assigned to three treatments. Dietary treatments consisted of the basal diet (CON) or the basal diet supplemented with 0.05% and 0.1% wood vinegar. The inclusion of dietary wood vinegar supplementation significantly improved the body weight gain (BWG) and average daily gain (ADG) (P=0.0521; 0.043) of pigs at week 16. The total track nutrient digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen was linearly increased in pigs fed with an increased amount of wood vinegar. In addition, dietary supplementation of wood vinegar linearly improved longissimus muscle area, yellowness (b*) of the meat color, and carcass weight (P<0.05) and a tendency in linear reduction was observed for water holding capacity (P=0.068), and drip loss at d5 and d7 (P=0.091, 0.069). However, there was no significant difference found for lean meat percentage and backfat thickness in this experiment. In summary, dietary inclusion of wood vinegar supplementation enhanced growth performance and total track digestibility of nutrients and had no effects on lean meat percentage and backfat thickness of grower-finisher pigs.",

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis, caused by multiple chronic liver injuries, is a known contributor to cirrhosis and even liver cancer. As a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Rhizoma curcumae has been extensively used in the treatment of liver fibrosis with satisfying therapeutic effects; however, its mechanism is unclear. The essential oil is the main bioactive component. The purpose of this study was to investigate the chemical profile and the pharmacological mechanisms of the essential oil of Rhizoma curcumae (EORC) against liver fibrosis by combining network pharmacology and transcriptomic technologies. A total of 37 active compounds were identified using the GC/MS system and literature mining, and the corresponding putative targets were predicted. Then, network pharmacology method was applied to identify the 168 candidate targets of EORC-alleviated liver fibrosis. String database and Cytoscape software were used to build the herb-compound-target network and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) network. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that EORC significantly influenced TGF-β1/Smads and PI3K/AKT pathways. Experimentally, we verified that EORC attenuated the severity and pathological changes during liver fibrosis progression based on the CCl4-induced liver fibrosis rat model. Transcriptomic technologies demonstrated that EORC ameliorated liver fibrosis partially by regulating the TGF-β1/Smads and PI3K/AKT pathways. In addition, the effect of vinegar-processed EORC was more significant than that of the raw one. Therefore, EORC can alleviate the severity of liver fibrosis through mechanisms predicted by network pharmacology and provide a basis for the further understanding of the application of EORC in the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Research evidence suggests that vinegar may effectively reduce postprandial glucose in both healthy adults and those with type 2 diabetes. There is heightened consumer interest in commercially available vinegar tablets; however, it is not known whether these products lower postprandial glycemia to the same extent as liquid vinegar. This crossover trial examined the impact of liquid vinegar versus commercial vinegar tablet ingestion at the start of a meal on the 60-minute glucose excursion postmeal in healthy adults. METHODS: Twelve young men and women (22.6 ± 0.6 y; 21.2 ± 1.2 kg/m2) completed this 4-arm Latin square crossover trial. Testing was separated by one week and consisted of a test meal (64 g carbohydrate) consumed immediately following one of the four oral treatments: CON, 60 g water (control treatment); VIN, 25 g liquid vinegar (5% acidity; 1.25 g acetic acid) diluted with 35 g water; PILL, four vinegar tablets (1.50 g acetic acid) swallowed whole with 60 g water; and PILL-c, four crushed vinegar tablets dissolved in 60 g water. Capillary blood glucose was tested in the fasted state and at 30 and 60 minutes postmeal. RESULTS: The 60-minute glucose excursion varied significantly by treatment (iAUC: 4.9 ± 0.6, 3.4 ± 0.4, 4.9 ± 0.6, and 4.1 ± 0.5 mmol˖h/l for CON, VIN, PILL, and PILL-c, respectively; F (3, 33) = 3.037, p = 0.043; repeated measures ANOVA). Post hoc analysis revealed a 31% reduction in the glucose postmeal excursion for VIN in comparison to CON and PILL (p = 0.040 and p = 0.049, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that commercial vinegar tablets taken whole at mealtime are not as effective as liquid vinegar for reducing the postmeal glucose excursion in young, healthy adults."

METHOD: Twenty-four patients aged over 18 years and diagnosed with granular myringitis grade I or II within 90 days of symptom onset were included. Patients were equally randomised into either the 1 per cent diluted vinegar group or the 1 per cent chloramphenicol group. Outcome of treatment and side effects were compared between groups. The main outcome measure was completely epithelialised tympanic membrane at the eight-week period. RESULTS: Eleven of 12 patients treated with 1 per cent diluted vinegar had complete recovery. In the 1 per cent chloramphenicol group, 8 of 12 patients recovered. The difference between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.156). The observed side effects of diluted vinegar included dizziness and mild external auditory canal irritation. CONCLUSION: One per cent diluted vinegar is an interesting option for granular myringitis. Other comparative advantages of 1 per cent diluted vinegar include its low price and no induction of antimicrobial resistance.",

Further they are associated with high morbidity and mortality from treatment failure. Therapy involves multiple rounds of ineffective antibiotics alongside unwanted side effects, alternative treatments are crucial. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a natural, vegan product that has been shown to have powerful antimicrobial activity hence we investigated whether ACV could ameliorate these resistant bacteria. The minimum dilution of ACV required for growth inhibition was comparable for both bacteria (1/25 dilution of ACV liquid and ACV tablets at 200 µg/ml were effective against rE. coli and MRSA). Monocyte co-culture with microbes alongside ACV resulted in an increase in monocyte phagocytosis by 21.2% and 33.5% compared to non-ACV treated but MRSA or rE. coli stimulated monocytes, respectively. Label free quantitative proteomic studies of microbial protein extracts demonstrated that ACV penetrated microbial cell membranes and organelles, altering the expression of key proteins. This resulted in significant reductions in total protein expression, moreover we could only detect ribosomal proteins; 50 s 30 s, enolase, phosphenol pyruvate and the ATP synthase subunit in rE. coli. Elongation factor iNOS and phosphoglycerate kinase OS were the only proteins present in MRSA samples following ACV treatment.",

      "abstract": "This experiment examines the effects of bamboo charcoal (BC) powder, bamboo vinegar (BV), and their combination (BCV) in the diet of laying hens on performance, egg quality, relative organ weights, and intestinal bacterial populations. A total of 320 laying hens (36 weeks of age) were divided into 4 treatment groups, with 10 replicates per treatment and 8 hens per replicate. They were fed on a control diet, the control diet supplemented with 0.8% BC, the control diet supplemented with 0.4% BV, or the control diet supplemented with a combination of BC (0.8%) and BV (0.4%) from 36 to 51 weeks of age. Egg production increased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets during 48 to 51 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Damaged egg rate decreased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets for the whole experiment (P < 0.05). Shell thickness was highest in the BCV-fed group at week 43, and shell strength was higher in the BV-fed group at week 51 (P < 0.05). Supplementation of BC or BCV in the diet resulted in a decreased abdominal fat pad (P < 0.05). In the ileal content, the population of Salmonella spp. decreased in the BV and BCV groups and the population of Lactobacillus spp. increased in the BV group (P < 0.05). The present results indicate that feeding BV or BCV alleviates damaged egg rate and decreases intestinal pathogenic bacteria, while feeding BC benefits by reducing abdominal fat. These results suggest that the effect of BCV seems to be induced by the synergistic effect of BC and BV, and that the BCV contributes to the effective use of bamboo on the laying hen's production.",
