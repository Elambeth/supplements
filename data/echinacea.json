      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Echinacea purpurea is widely utilized in dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, and herbal medicine, yet its effectiveness and safety for children remain debated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of E. purpurea in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and otitis media (OM) in children. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed from January 2000 to December 2023. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted and reported according to the PRISMA 2020 Checklist and Cochrane Training 2022 guidelines. RESULTS: 9 randomized controlled trials with 1518 participants in the treatment group, 1651 participants in the placebo control group, met the selection criteria. Products derived from E. purpurea are highly diverse, utilizing different plant parts such as roots, leaves, and flowers, available in various dosage forms like capsules and extracts, and manufactured in numerous countries worldwide. Risk of bias was assessed according to the PEDro scale with 3 studies of excellent quality, 5 studies of high quality and 1 study of moderate quality. The meta-analysis found that E. purpurea significantly benefits URTI, reducing treatment duration (SMD = -0.19, 95% CI [-0.30; -0.09], p < 0.01), incidence (RR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.75; 0.87]), and antibiotic use (RR = 0.18, 95% CI [0.13; 0.25], p < 0.01). However, adverse events were moderately increased (RR = 1.38, 95% CI [1.08; 1.78]), though generally mild. For OM, E. purpurea lowered episode incidence (RR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.44; 0.73], p < 0.01) but did not shorten treatment duration (p = 0.10). Its effectiveness may be limited due to OM's bacterial etiology, often requiring antibiotics. While E. purpurea may help reduce recurrence, it is unlikely to speed recovery. Further research on optimal formulations and dosages is needed.The publication bias of pooled results as assessed by the funnel plot showed that the studies had certain bias, largely due to heterogeneity between studies. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis of nine studies found that E. purpurea was effective in reducing the duration of treatment, the incidence of episodes, and antibiotic usage for URTI in children, with some positive effects on OM. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy and safety of E. purpurea in treating URTI and OM in children, providing evidence-based insights to guide clinical decisions and inform healthcare professionals and parents considering its use. However, the safety profile remains unclear, particularly regarding adverse events. Further research is required to standardize methodologies and confirm these results."

      "abstract": "Echinacea purpurea (L.) Monech has a diverse range of phytochemicals, including flavonoids, polyphenols, phenolic acids, alkylamides, and terpenoids. Phenolic and flavonoid substances derived from the leaves and flowers have been used for treatment of illness. The aim of this study to evaluate the polyphenolic components of the flowers and leaves of E. purpurea, along with the diurnal variations and the morphological differences. Two-year-old in full bloom flowers and leaves were harvested at different times of the day (6:00 am, 9:00 am, 12:00 am, 03:00 pm, 06:00 pm, 09:00 pm). The water and methanol extracts prepared from these samples to determine total phenolic, total flavonoid and phenolic compound contents. The experiment was established in randomized complete block design with three factors and three replications. The highest total phenolic content was observed in flowers with methanol extract (157.91 ± 0.32 mg QE/g dry extract) at 09.00 a.m. Also the highest total flavonoid content was observed in leaves with methanol extract at 09.00 a.m (80.12 ± 0.16 mg QE/g dry extract). Chlorogenic acid (19.1 ± 0.83 mg/g methanol extract) and caffeic acid (13.2 ± 0.58 mg/g methanol extract) were identified as the predominant phenolic acids. The peak concentrations of these phenolic acids were observed at 6:00 a.m, followed by a gradual decline throughout the subsequent hours of the day. Findings emphasize the importance of harvesting E. purpurea at the optimal time to maximize antioxidant capacity. This study provides valuable new information on morphogenetic and diurnal variation of phenolic and flavonoid content for drug and pharmaceutical raw material production.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Echinacea extracts with unique alkamide profiles (EP107™) have been shown to affect upper respiratory tract infections and reduce anxiety in both animals and humans. However, a recent study found that a similar extract did not reduce anxiety more than a placebo, although it did enhance well-being and produced antidepressant-like effects. We hypothesized that the discrepancy arose from the differences in the anxiety assessment methods used. The study that observed no effects used the Clinically Useful Anxiety Outcome Scale, which focuses on physical symptoms, while earlier studies used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, which focuses on psychic symptoms. Methods: To investigate the influence of the anxiety measure on the detectability of anxiolytic effects, we examined the effects of Echinacea EP107TM using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-anxiety subscale (HADS-A), which focuses on psychic symptoms, and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), most items of which involve physical symptoms. The study was placebo-controlled, double-blind, and multicenter. Results: The extract significantly alleviated anxiety compared to placebo when measured with HADS-A. HAM-A total scores did not show significant treatment effects. However, Echinacea was superior to placebo in three psychic anxiety items on the HAM-A. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Echinacea EP107TM reduces psychic anxiety without affecting somatic symptoms. This indicates that the extract may be useful in mild or early-phase anxiety when somatic symptoms are not prominent."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of anti-galactagogue (sage, parsley extract) and anti-inflammatory (echinacea extract) feed supplements on prolactin levels and fertility in the re-pregnancy of lactating Merino ewes. Eighty ewes were randomly assigned to one of two groups: control and treatment. In treatment group (Stop Lactin) group (n = 40) ewes were treated with Stop Lactin® 60 ml on day 0 orally by syringe. The control group (Control) (n = 40), ewes were not treated with any anti-galactagogue feed supplements. On day 0, a vaginal sponge containing 60 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate was inserted for seven days. On day 7, all ewes received an intramuscular injection of 500 IU PMSG. The study results indicated no statistically significant differences between the Control group and Stop Lactin group in terms of conception rates (87.2% and 78.1%), late embryonic-early fetal mortality rate (20.6% and 8.0%), lambing rate (79.4% and 92%), twin rate (29.6% and 13.0%) and litter size (1.30 and 1.13). Estrus rates (97.5% and 82.1%, p = 0.050) tended to be higher and pregnancy rates (85.0% and 64.1%, p = 0.037) was found to be significant in the control group compared to the Stop Lactin group. The effect of treatment (P = 0.209) on serum prolactin levels and the interaction between treatment × day (P = 0.874) were both found to be insignificant. It is concluded that anti-galactagogue and anti-inflammatory feed supplements did not reduce prolactin concentration and did not improve fertility in lactating Merino ewes.",

This study explores the potential of compounds from Echinacea angustifolia (E. angustifolia) to inhibit the activity of ZIKV's RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), a key enzyme in the viral replication process and an ideal candidate for antiviral therapy. Utilizing computational techniques, we conducted a thorough virtual examination using the MTi-OpenScreen tool to identify potential RDRP inhibitors among E. angustifolia compounds. The top four compounds were further examined through re-docking procedures. To assess the robustness and effectiveness of these interactions, we performed molecular dynamics simulations along with calculations of the binding free energy and PCA analysis. This investigation highlighted four naturally occurring compounds, viz., Echinacoside, Rutin, Echinacin, and Cynaroside, demonstrating a notable affinity for binding to the allosteric site of ZIKV RDRP. These compounds showed strong hydrogen bond formation with crucial residues of the RDRP and presented favorable binding free energies. Our research sheds light on the viability of these E. angustifolia compounds as ZIKV RDRP inhibitors, laying a foundation for further experimental research in developing novel antiviral treatments against ZIKV infections.",

      "abstract": "Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are a prevalent health issue, causing considerable morbidity. Despite the availability of conventional treatments, there is an increasing interest in natural products due to their potential antiviral and immunomodulatory benefits. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an ELA blend (E-Echinacea purpurea, L-Lonicera cerulea, A-Aronia melanocarpa) in preventing and alleviating the symptoms of URTIs. Additionally, the study examines the blend's antiviral and immunomodulatory effects both in vitro and through a clinical trial. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 61 participants prone to URTIs, with a 60-day treatment and follow-up period. A placebo group later received the ELA blend for 60 days. The ELA blend significantly reduced the incidence of URTIs during the observation period (2 vs. 8; p = 0.044) and, in particular, throat-related symptoms (8 vs. 16; p = 0.038). Analyses of PBMCs showed that baseline production of the cytokines IFN-γ (p = 0.020), IL-1β (p = 0.004), IL-2(p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.001), and TNF-α (p < 0.001) increased after ELA blend treatment. Moreover, the ELA blend modulated cytokine production in response to PHA-L stimulation, decreasing IFN-γ (p = 0.008) and IL-2 (p = 0.012) while increasing IL-1β (p = 0.005). Following R848 stimulation, the ELA blend enhanced the production of INF-α (p = 0.012) and IL-2 (p = 0.025), and decreased IL-1β (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.001), and TNF-α (p = 0.049). The blend suppressed VSV replication and significantly increased cytokine levels, with IFN-γ increasing by 98 pg/mL (p = 0.002), IL-1β rising by 233.0 pg/mL (p = 0.004), and TNF-α showing an increase of 2905 pg/mL (p = 0.002). These findings highlight the ELA blend's potential to alleviate URTI symptoms, modulate inflammatory and antiviral immune responses, and inhibit viral replication. Further investigations should aim to validate these findings through large-scale studies, and explore the ELA blend's long-term safety and efficacy in diverse populations. Additionally, research should investigate optimal dosing strategies and explore potential synergistic effects with conventional treatments to maximize clinical outcomes.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many COVID-19 patients experience mild to severe symptoms, including respiratory system involvement. Different treatment instructions have been suggested for patients with COVID-19. Echinacea has known antiviral effects. However, there is still not enough evidence that it is effective in treating COVID-19. This study was conducted with the aim of determining the effect of Echinacea extract syrup on the outcomes of the lower respiratory tract in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 40 patients with COVID-19 who were inpatients in the hospitals of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran, were randomly selected and assigned to two equal control and experimental groups (n = 20). In addition to receiving routine care and treatment (oxygen supply, remdesivir, enoxaparin and heparin), the experimental group received 5 cubic centimeter (CC) of Imogen syrup three times a day for 5 days each. The control group only received routine care and treatment. The data were collected on the first, third and fifth days after hospitalization and were analyzed using descriptive and analytical tests in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The significance level was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean white blood cell count in the experimental group after the intervention decreased significantly compared to that before the intervention (t = 0.434, p = 0.045, df = 19). Arterial oxygen pressure increased significantly in both the experimental group (t = 4.382, p = 0.000, df = 19) and control group (t = 3.239, p = 0.004, df = 19), however no statistical differences were observed between experimental and control groups after intervention. The level of lung involvement (p = 0.320) and cough symptoms (P = 0.347) were not significantly different between the experimental and control groups after the intervention. In addition, there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the mean oxygen saturation, temperature, and number of breaths per minute on the first, third, and fifth day (p > 0.05). DISCUSSION: The consumption of Echinacea extract syrup may not be able to improve the symptoms of acute lower respiratory tract infection in patients with COVID-19 with 3 daily doses for 5 days. More studies should be conducted to investigate the clinical effects of Echinacea extract in the treatment of patients with pulmonary complications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT20130522013423N2.",

Moench crude extract (EE) and citric acid (CA) against Cronobacter sakazakii isolated from powdered infant formula (PIF). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EE against C. sakazakii was determined, and then growth curve and time-kill analysis were used to screen the optimal antibacterial combination of 1 MIC of EE and CA. Changes in cell membrane potential, cell integrity, cell permeability, bacterial protein, DNA, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and cell morphology of C. sakazakii were used to reveal the synergistic inhibitory mechanism of EE and CA. The inactivation effect of EE in combination with CA against C. sakazakii on common contact surfaces was used to evaluate its efficacy as a natural disinfectant. The results showed that the MIC value of EE against C. sakazakii was 60 mg/mL, and the growth curve of C. sakazakii treated by 1 MIC of EE combined with CA (pH 3.0) was significantly inhibited compared with the control groups. The results of time-kill analysis showed that after combined treatment with 1 MIC of EE and CA (pH 3.0) for 30 min, approximately 8 log cfu/mL of C. sakazakii were inactivated. Cell membrane hyperpolarization, damaged cell membrane integrity, improved cell membrane permeability, decreased bacterial protein and DNA levels, increased and then decreased intracellular ROS contents, and deformed and ruptured cell morphology were found in C. sakazakii treated by EE combined with CA, and these phenomena were more pronounced than in C. sakazakii treated by EE or CA alone. When inoculated stainless steel, glass, ceramic, polystyrene, bamboo, and wood were sprayed with 1 MIC of EE combined with CA (pH 3.0) and after 15 min of treatment, approximately 5 log cfu/mL of C. sakazakii were inactivated. These findings suggest that EE combined with CA can effectively inactivate C. sakazakii isolated from PIF and can be used as a natural disinfectant to reduce the contamination of C. sakazakii in PIF production environments or households.",

Echinacea preparations are considered a non-specific immune stimulant that is used as a phytotherapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of colds. In the 2021 ZEIT ranking of the best-selling pharmacy-only medicines in Germany, four Echinacea preparations were among the top ten, and they experienced a new hype during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, 22 Echinacea monopreparations, which are approved as herbal medicinal products, were analyzed based on their package inserts. The preparations used in clinical studies were compared with the preparations available on the market with regard to the criteria of plant species used, plant part used, preparation (extract or pressed juice), drug-extract ratio, single dose administered, standardization of the preparations, prior performance of an ingredient analysis, galenics, dosage, duration of administration, and daily dose administered. The analysis revealed that the preparations available on the market are very heterogeneous. The composition can vary considerably in terms of ingredients. For customers, these products appear homogeneous in terms of their presentation on the market. The legal framework conditions promote this situation. The clinical studies are also unable to adequately reflect the market situation. New studies based on market reality, with an analysis of ingredients in the preparations used, a standardized study design, and the inclusion of hematological and biochemical parameters in the evaluation should improve this situation.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Echinacea species, particularly Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia, and Echinacea pallida, are renowned for their immunomodulatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. OBJECTIVES: This review explores the mechanisms by which echinacea herbal extracts modulate immune responses, focusing on their effects on both innate and adaptive immunity in bacterial and viral infections. RESULTS: Key bioactive compounds, such as alkamides, caffeic acid derivatives, flavonoids, and polysaccharides, contribute to these effects. These compounds enhance immune cell activity, including macrophages and natural killer cells, stimulating cytokine production and phagocytosis. The antibacterial activity of echinacea against respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila) and skin pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes) is reviewed, as well as its antiviral efficacy against viruses like herpes simplex, influenza, and rhinovirus. Echinacea's potential as a complementary treatment alongside conventional antibiotics and antivirals is discussed, particularly in the context of antibiotic resistance and emerging viral threats. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges associated with variability in phytochemical content and the need for standardized extraction processes are also addressed. This review provides a comprehensive overview of echinacea's therapeutic potential and outlines future directions for research, including clinical trials and dosage optimization."

      "abstract": "Background: Prolonged exposure to stress is a risk factor for the onset of several disorders. Modern life is burdened by a pervasive prevalence of stress, which represents a major societal challenge requiring new therapeutic strategies. In this context, botanical drug-based therapies can have a paramount importance. Methods: Here we studied the preventive effects of a repeated treatment (p.o. daily, 3 weeks) with a combination of Centella asiatica (200 mg/kg), Echinacea purpurea (20 mg/kg) and Zingiber officinale (150 mg/kg) standardized extracts, on the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) deleterious outcomes. After 10 days of CSDS exposure, male mice' performances were evaluated in paradigms relevant for social (social interaction test), emotional (tail suspension test), cognitive (novel object recognition) domains as well as for pain perception (cold plate and von Frey tests) and motor skills (rotarod). Mice were then sacrificed, the spinal cords, hippocampi and frontal cortices dissected and processed for RT-PCR analysis. Results: Extracts mix treatment prevented stress-induced social aversion, memory impairment, mechanical and thermal allodynia and reduced behavioural despair independently of stress exposure. The treatment stimulated hippocampal and cortical BDNF and TrkB mRNA levels and counteracted stress-induced alterations in pro- (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10) cytokines expression in the same areas. It also modulated expression of pain related genes (GFAP and Slc1a3) in the spinal cord. Conclusion: The treatment with the extracts mix obtained from C. asiatica, E. purpurea and Z. officinale may represent a promising strategy to promote resilience and prevent the deleterious effects induced by extended exposure to psychosocial stress."

      "abstract": "Previous studies have highlighted the beneficial properties of plants rich in polyphenols, such as Lonicera caerulea var. Kamtschatica Sevast. (LCK), Aronia melanocarpa (AM), and Echinacea purpurea (EP). These plants have demonstrated antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and potential antiviral effects. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the ELA blend, a polyphenol-rich blend containing EP, LCK, and AM, on the cellular mechanisms involved in viral infection. To assess the effects of the ELA blend, various experiments were conducted using A549 cells and a mucociliary tissue 3D model called EpiAirway™. Inflammation and oxidative stress induced by LPS were evaluated through measurements of SOD activity, ELISA, and qPCR analysis. Additionally, antiviral assays were performed in a cell-present environment to examine the blend's effectiveness against HCoV-OC43. The results showed that the ELA blend-treated group exhibited reduced expression of IL1B, CXCL8, ICAM1, MCP1, and RELA in both A549 cells and EpiAirway™. Moreover, the blend enhanced the expression of CAT, HMOX1, SOD1, and SOD2 in A549 cells. The antiviral activity of the ELA blend was also investigated, i.e. its influence on viral replication cycle, to determine the potential as an antiviral preparation. At the highest non-cytotoxic concentration, the ELA blend demonstrated a 87.5 % reduction in viral titer when administered simultaneously with HCoV-OC43. It emphasize potential ability of the preparation to block viral entry to the host cells. At the same time, ELA blend did not express virucidal activity, i.e. inactivation of free viral particles, against HCoV-OC43. In conclusion, ELA blend displayed antiviral activity and exhibited immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that ELA blend has potential for the prevention and treatment of viral infections."

      "abstract": "Athletes are increasingly relying on natural supplements to improve athletic performance. Echinacea, a common herbal supplement, has been studied for its potential erythropoietin-enhancing effects, with mixed results in the literature. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to determine whether echinacea supplementation has erythropoietic or ergogenic effects in athletes. A search strategy was developed to identify trials studying the impact of echinacea supplementation on erythropoiesis and maximal oxygen uptake. The database search yielded 502 studies, 496 of which were excluded in the two-reviewer screening process. Six studies with a total of 107 athletes were included in the analysis. For hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, there were small, positive effect sizes when comparing the difference in pre- and post-intervention levels between the echinacea and placebo groups, at 0.38 (p = 0.02, 95% CI -0.04-0.80, I2 = 70%) and 0.34 (p < 0.01, 95% CI -0.10-0.78, I2 = 86%), respectively, though they did not reach statistical significance. There was also no statistically significant change in erythropoietin (effect size -0.29, p = 0.05, 95% CI -0.75-0.17, I2 = 67%) or maximal oxygen uptake (effect size -0.20, p = 0.95, 95% CI -0.60-0.21, I2 = 0%). Echinacea supplementation did not influence erythropoietin, hemoglobin, hematocrit, or maximal oxygen uptake in athletes; however, the evidence base is limited.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic intestinal ailment which cannot be completely cured. The occurrence of UC has been on the rise in recent years, which is highly detrimental to patients. The effectiveness of conventional drug treatment is limited. The long-term usage of these agents can lead to substantial adverse effects. Therefore, the development of a safe and efficient dietary supplement is important for the prevention of UC. Echinacea purpurea polysaccharide (EPP) is one of the main bioactive substances in Echinacea purpurea. EPP has many favorable effects, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects. However, whether EPP can prevent or alleviate UC is still unclear. This study aims to analyze the effect and mechanism of EPP on UC in mice using a 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model. The results showed that dietary supplementation with 200 mg/kg EPP significantly alleviated the shortening of colon length, weight loss, and histopathological damage in DSS-induced colitis mice. Mechanistically, EPP significantly inhibits the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and preserves the intestinal mechanical barrier integrity by enhancing the expression of claudin-1, ZO-1, and occludin and reducing the loss of goblet cells. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that EPP intervention reduced the abundance of Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, and Klebsiella; the abundance of Lactobacillus increased. The results of nontargeted metabonomics showed that EPP reshaped metabolism. In this study, we clarified the effect of EPP on UC, revealed the potential function of EPP, and supported the use of polysaccharide dietary supplements for UC prevention.",

In this study, we examined whether Echinacea could reduce the need for antibiotics by preventing RTIs and their complications, and subsequently investigated its safety profile. A comprehensive search of EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane DARE and clinicaltrials.gov identified 30 clinical trials (39 comparisons) studying Echinacea for the prevention or treatment of RTIs in 5652 subjects. Echinacea significantly reduced the monthly RTI occurrence, risk ratio (RR) 0.68 (95% CI 0.61-0.77) and number of patients with ≥1 RTI, RR = 0.75 [95% CI 0.69-0.81] corresponding to an odds ratio 0.53 [95% CI 0.42-0.67]. Echinacea reduced the risk of recurrent infections (RR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.46-0.80), RTI complications (RR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.36-0.54) and the need for antibiotic therapy (RR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.39-0.93), with total antibiotic therapy days reduced by 70% (IRR = 0.29; 95% CI 0.11-0.74). Alcoholic extracts from freshly harvested Echinacea purpurea were the strongest, with an 80% reduction of antibiotic treatment days, IRR 0.21 [95% CI 0.15-0.28]. An equal number of adverse events occurred with Echinacea and control treatment. Echinacea can safely prevent RTIs and associated complications, thereby decreasing the demand for antibiotics. Relevant differences exist between Echinacea preparations."

In this study, we investigated the potential mechanism of EPP intervention in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results demonstrated that EPP effectively mitigated liver injury caused by HCC, inhibited the proliferation of HCC, and induced apoptosis. Following EPP intervention, there was a significant increase in propionic acid and butyric acid-producing gut microbiota such as Coprococcus, Clostridium and Roseburia, leading to enhanced expression of intestinal tight junction proteins and the repair of the intestinal barrier. This controls lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leakage, which in turn inhibits the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and reduces the expression of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, as well as migration factors like MMP-2. Metabolomics revealed the downregulation of pyrimidine metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, along with the upregulation of butyrate metabolism in tumor cells. This study demonstrated that EPP effectively regulated LPS leakage by modulating gut microbes, and this modulation influenced the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, ultimately disrupting tumor cell survival induced by HCC in mice.",

Total phenolics content, reducing power and radical scavenging activity of EchEE were estimated. Four groups of adult male albino rats were used (10 rats each) as follows: 1) Control healthy rats ingested with placebo, 2) Healthy rats orally received EchEE (465 mg/kg/day), 3) Rats intoxicated with BIF (7mg/kg/day) dissolved in olive oil, and 4) Rats co-treated with EchEE (465 mg/kg/day) besides to BIF (7mg/kg/day) intoxication. After 30 days, some neuro-chemical and behavioral tests were assessed. The behavioral tests revealed that rats received BIF exhibited exploratory behavior and spatial learning impairments, memory and locomotion dysfunction, and enhanced anxiety level. Biochemical findings revealed that BIF induced-oxidative stress in the cortex and hippocampus; this was appeared from the significant rise in malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, coupled with decreased catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activities, and reduced glutathione (GSH) level in both brain areas. Also, BIF induced a significant increase caspas-3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß) in both areas; dopamine and serotonin levels, and ACh-ase activity were markedly decreased in both areas. Interestingly, treatment of rats with EchEE in combination with BIF resulted in a significant decrease in oxidative stress damage, and modulation of the apoptotic and pro-inflammatory markers. Also, EchEE markedly improved behavioral activities and neurotransmitters level that were impaired by BIF. In conclusion, the present study clearly indicated that EchEE can attenuate brain dysfunction induced by pesticides exposure through preventing the oxidative stress. This may be attributed to its high antioxidant component.",

      "abstract": "Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench is a medicinal plant commonly used for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, the common cold, sore throat, migraine, colic, stomach cramps, and toothaches and the promotion of wound healing. Based on the known pharmacological properties of essential oils (EOs), we hypothesized that E. purpurea EOs may contribute to these medicinal properties. In this work, EOs from the flowers of E. purpurea were steam-distilled and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), GC with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID), and chiral GC-MS. The EOs were also evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial and innate immunomodulatory activity. About 87 compounds were identified in five samples of the steam-distilled E. purpurea EO. The major components of the E. purpurea EO were germacrene D (42.0 ± 4.61%), α-phellandrene (10.09 ± 1.59%), β-caryophyllene (5.75 ± 1.72%), γ-curcumene (5.03 ± 1.96%), α-pinene (4.44 ± 1.78%), δ-cadinene (3.31 ± 0.61%), and β-pinene (2.43 ± 0.98%). Eleven chiral compounds were identified in the E. purpurea EO, including α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, α-phellandrene, limonene, β-phellandrene, α-copaene, β-elemene, β-caryophyllene, germacrene D, and δ-cadinene. Analysis of E. purpurea EO antimicrobial activity showed that they inhibited the growth of several bacterial species, although the EO did not seem to be effective for Staphylococcus aureus. The E. purpurea EO and its major components induced intracellular calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. Additionally, pretreatment of human neutrophils with the E. purpurea EO or (+)-δ-cadinene suppressed agonist-induced neutrophil calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. Moreover, pharmacophore mapping studies predicted two potential MAPK targets for (+)-δ-cadinene. Our results are consistent with previous reports on the innate immunomodulatory activities of β-caryophyllene, α-phellandrene, and germacrene D. Thus, this study identified δ-cadinene as a novel neutrophil agonist and suggests that δ-cadinene may contribute to the reported immunomodulatory activity of E. purpurea.",

Nutraceutical strategies have been proposed as promising strategies to mitigate their impact and improve public health. In the present study, we developed a mixture of two hydroalcoholic extracts from the aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench (ECP) and the cones of Humulus lupulus L. (HOP) that can be harnessed in the prevention and treatment of viral respiratory diseases. The ECP/HOP mixture (named ECHOPvir) was characterized for the antioxidant and cytoprotective properties in airway cells. Moreover, the immunomodulating properties of the mixture in murine macrophages against antioxidant and inflammatory stimuli and its antiviral efficacy against the PR8/H1N1 influenza virus were assayed. The modulation of the Nrf2 was also investigated as a mechanistic hypothesis. The ECP/HOP mixture showed a promising multitarget bioactivity profile, with combined cytoprotective, antioxidant, immunomodulating and antiviral activities, likely due to the peculiar phytocomplexes of both ECP and HOP, and often potentiated the effect of the single extracts. The Nrf2 activation seemed to trigger these cytoprotective properties and suggest a possible usefulness in counteracting the damage caused by different stressors, including viral infection. Further studies may strengthen the interest in this product and underpin its future nutraceutical applications.",

Thirty-eight databases were searched. Included studies were mechanistic studies (in vitro, animal, and human studies and reviews) on these herbs; published before June 2021. Non-mechanistic studies or studies on combinations of herbs other than ivy/primrose/thyme were excluded. Furthermore, three experts in traditional, complementary and integrative healthcare (TCIH) research and pharmacognosy were interviewed to collect additional expert knowledge. The results show that A. paniculata acts through immunomodulation and antiviral activity, possibly supplemented by antibacterial and antipyretic effects. P. sidoides acts through antiviral, indirect antibacterial, immunomodulatory and expectorant effects. Echinacea species likely act through immunomodulation. The combination of ivy/primrose/thyme combines secretolytic and spasmolytic effects from ivy with antibacterial effects from thyme. Studies on primrose were lacking. This mechanistic evidence supports the difference-making evidence from clinical studies, contributes to evidence-based recommendations for their use in URTI treatment, and guides future mechanistic studies on URTI treatments."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Preparations of Echinacea have been used by herbalists to boost the immune system. OBJECTIVE: In this study, Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench (Asteraceae) extract with enriched chicoric acid content was investigated for immunomodulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The standardized hydroalcoholic extract (4% chicoric acid) was prepared from the aerial parts of E. purpurea (SEP). The extract was screened for in vitro antioxidant activities, and immunomodulation in RAW 264.7 cells, at 200 and 400 µg/mL. Further, the male BALB/c mice (20-25 g) were divided into 4 groups (n = 6 per group). All the groups except control, were intraperitoneally injected with 70 mg/kg/day of cyclophosphamide (CTX) for 4 consecutive days. The treatment groups received SEP extract (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) p.o. from day 5 to 14. RESULTS: The SEP extract inhibited DPPH (IC50 = 106.7 µg/mL), ABTS+ (IC50 = 19.88 µg/mL) and nitric oxide (IC50 = 120.1 µg/mL). The SEP extract's ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) value was 1931.63 µM TE/g. In RAW 264.7 cells, SEP extract increased the nitric oxide production by 30.76- and 39.07-fold at 200 and 400 µg/mL, respectively, compared to the untreated cells. SEP extract significantly increased phagocytosis and cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in the cells. Further, the extract improved immune organ indices, lymphocyte proliferation and serum cytokine levels in CTX-induced mice. The extract at 200 mg/kg significantly increased the natural killer cell activity (24.6%) and phagocytic index (28.03%) of CTX mice. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly support SEP extract with 4% chicoric acid as a functional ingredient for immunomodulation.",

      "abstract": "Echinacea purpurea (EP) is an herb that has demonstrated immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects with the potential to improve immunity, health, and performance in animals. The objective of this study was to investigate how supplementing calves with EP affects their blood immunity marker profile, health, intake, and growth. Male Holstein calves (n = 240), sourced from local dairy farms or auction, arrived at a rearing facility between 5 and 14 d of age and were kept in individual pens in 1 of 3 rooms (80/room) for 56 d, and then put into groups for the remaining 21 d of the trial. Calves received milk replacer (MR) 2× per day for 56 d (total = 36 kg of MR) and had ab libitum water and starter access. Within room, calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) control (n = 80), (2) 3g of dried (powder) EP extract per day split over 2 milk feedings from experiment d 14-28 (n = 80), and (3) 3 g of dried (powder) EP extract per day split over 2 milk feedings from experiment d 1-56 (E56; n = 80). The powdered EP treatments were mixed into the liquid MR. On d 1, 14, 28, and 57 rectal temperatures and blood were collected from a subset of calves (n = 117; 39 calves/treatment), and blood serum was assessed for serum total protein (d 1), haptoglobin, white blood cells, and cytokines. Failed transfer of passive immunity was defined as serum total protein <5.2 g/dL. Calves were health scored 2× per day, receiving fecal and respiratory scores until d 28 and 77, respectively. Calves were weighed on arrival and then weekly until d 77. Milk replacer and feed refusals were recorded. Supplementation of EP was associated with lower haptoglobin levels, segmented neutrophil counts, segmented neutrophil per lymphocyte ratio, respiratory scores in auction derived calves, and higher lymphocyte counts and d 28 rectal temperature. Of calves with heavier arrival body weight, E56 calves had greater postweaning weekly body weight. There was no detected effect of EP supplementation on total white blood cells, band neutrophil, monocyte, and basophil counts, IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, fecal scores, risk of receiving diarrhea and respiratory treatment, risk of bovine respiratory disease (calves were deemed at risk for bovine respiratory disease if they had at least 1 respiratory score ≥5), risk of mortality, MR and feed intake, average daily gain, and feed conversion ratio. Overall, EP supplementation to dairy calves was associated with immunomodulation and reduced inflammation, evidenced through blood markers, although only few minor health and growth improvements were observed. Benefits were observed particularly when fed across the whole milk feeding period.",

      "abstract": "Echinacea purpurea is a perennial plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family. It has a wide range of applications mainly in the treatment and prevention of inflammations in the respiratory system. The current study aimed to perform a phytochemical characterization of purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) roots and their extracts (water, 40%, 50%, 60% ethanol, and 60% glycerol). Phytochemical characterization was carried out by gravimetric, spectrophotometric, and chromatographic methods. Echinacea roots were characterized by a low lipid (0.8%) content. In contrast, carbohydrates (45%) and proteins (20%) occupied a large part of the dry matter. Amongst the extracts, the highest yield was obtained using water as a solvent (53%). Water extract was rich in protein and carbohydrates as fructans (inulin) were the most abundant carbohydrate constituent. The most exhaustive recovery of the phenolic components was conducted by extraction with 40% ethanol and 60% glycerol. It was found that water is the most suitable extractant for obtaining a polysaccharide-containing complex (PSC) (8.87%). PSC was composed mainly of fructans (inulin) and proteins with different molecular weight distributions. The yield of PSC decreased with an increasing ethanol concentration (40% > 50% > 60%) but the lowest yield was obtained from 60% glycerol extract. The obtained results showed that Echinacea roots contained a large amount of biologically active substances-phenolic components and polysaccharides and that glycerol was equally efficient to ethanol in extracting caffeic acid derivatives from purple coneflower roots. The data can be used for the preparation of extracts having different compositions and thus easily be incorporated into commercial products.",

One of the largest areas of misuse is in outpatient upper respiratory infections (URIs). The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of EZC Pak, a combination Echinacea-Zinc-Vitamin C dose pack with or without Vitamin D, on the duration of illness and symptom severity of non-specific URIs as an alternative to antibiotics when none are deemed clinically necessary. A secondary analysis was carried out on patient satisfaction. METHODS: A total of 360 patients across the United States were enrolled and randomized in a double-blind manner across two intervention groups, EZC Pak, EZC Pak+Vitamin D, and one placebo group. The study utilized a smartphone-based app to capture data. Once a participant reported the first URI symptom, they were instructed to take the intervention as directed and complete the daily symptom survey score until their symptoms resolved. RESULTS: The average EZC Pak participant recovered 1.39 days (90% CI 1.05 to 1.73) faster than the average placebo participant (p=0.017). The average EZC Pak participant reported a 17.43% (90% CI 17.1 to 17.8) lower symptom severity score versus placebo (p=0.029). EZC Pak users reported 2.9 times higher patient satisfaction versus placebo users (p=0.012). The addition of Vitamin D neither benefited nor harmed illness duration or symptom severity. CONCLUSION: The findings support the potential use of EZC Pak as an alternative to patient request for antibiotics when none are deemed clinically necessary at the time of initial clinical presentation. The decision to replete vitamin D in the acute phase of URI is an individualized decision left to the patient and their clinician. EZC Pak may play a critical role in improving outpatient URI management and antibiotic stewardship (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04943575)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Echinacea purpurea has clinical antiviral activity against respiratory viruses and modulates immune functions. In this study, we compared higher doses of new Echinacea formulations with conventional formulations at lower, preventive doses for therapy of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). METHODS: In this randomized, blinded, controlled trial, healthy adults (n = 409) were randomized between November 2018 and January 2019 to one of four Echinacea formulations, which were taken in case of an RTI for up to 10 days. New formulations A (lozenges) and B (spray) delivered an increased dose of 16,800 mg/d Echinacea extract during days 1-3 and 2,240-3,360 mg/d afterward; as controls, conventional formulations C (tablets) and D (drops) delivered a lower daily dose of 2,400 mg, usually taken for prevention. The primary endpoint was time to clinical remission of first RTI episodes based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis of patient-reported, investigator-confirmed, respiratory symptoms assessed for up to 10 days. In a sensitivity analysis, the mean time to remission beyond day 10 was calculated by extrapolating the treatment effects observed on days 7 to 10. RESULTS: A total of 246 participants (median age 32 years, 78% female participants) were treated for at least one RTI. Recovery by day 10 (complete absence of symptoms) was achieved in 56 and 44% of patients with the new and conventional formulations, respectively, showing a median time to recovery of 10 and 11 days, respectively (p = 0.10 in intention-to-treat analysis, p = 0.07 in per-protocol analysis). In the extrapolated sensitivity analysis, new formulations resulted in a significantly shorter mean time to remission (9.6 vs. 11.0 days, p < 0.001). Among those with an identified respiratory virus, viral clearance until day 10 based on real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs was more frequent with new formulations (70 vs. 53%, p = 0.046). Tolerability and safety (adverse events: 12 vs. 6%, p = 0.19) were good and similar between formulations. There was one severe adverse event with a potential hypersensitivity reaction in a recipient of the novel spray formulation. CONCLUSION: In adults with acute RTI, new Echinacea formulations with higher doses resulted in faster viral clearance than conventional formulations in prophylactic dosages. The trend for faster clinical recovery was not significant by day 10 but became so upon extrapolation. A dose increase during acute respiratory symptoms might improve the clinical benefits of orally administered Echinacea formulations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Swiss National Clinical Trials Portal (SNCTP000003069) and on ClinicalTrials.gov (NTC03812900; URL https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03812900?cond=echinacea&draw=3&rank=14)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute tonsillopharyngitis or sore throat is an initial sign of viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) and an optimal indicator for early antiviral and anti-inflammatory intervention. Both of these actions have been attributed to Echinacea purpurea and Salvia officinalis. METHODS: 74 patients (age 13-69 years) with acute sore throat symptoms (&lt;48 h) were treated with five Echinacea/Salvia lozenges per day (4,000 mg Echinacea purpurea extract [Echinaforce®] and 1,893 mg Salvia officinalis extract [A. Vogel AG, Switzerland] daily) for 4 days. Symptom intensities were recorded in a diary and oropharyngeal swab samples collected for virus detection and quantification via RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The treatment was exceptionally well tolerated, no complicated RTI developed, and no antibiotic treatment was required. A single lozenge reduced throat pain by 48% (p &lt; 0.001) and tonsillopharyngitis symptoms by 34% (p &lt; 0.001). Eighteen patients tested virus positive at inclusion. Viral loads in these patients was reduced by 62% (p &lt; 0.03) after intake of a single lozenge and by 96% (p &lt; 0.02) after 4 days of treatment compared to pre-treatment.

Moench (EP) is a globally popular herbal medicine, which showed effects on growth promotion, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities in fish culture world widely. However, there are few studies about the effects on miRNAs by EP in fish. The hybrid snakehead fish (Channa maculate♀ × Channa argus ♂) was new important economic specie of freshwater aquaculture in China with high market value and demand while there were only a few reports about its miRNAs. To overview immune-related miRNAs of the hybrid snakehead fish and to further understand the immune regulating mechanism of EP, we herein constructed and analyzed three small RNA libraries of immune tissues including liver, spleen and head kidney of the fish with or without EP treatment via Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. Results showed that EP can affect the immune activities of fish by the miRNA-regulated ways. Totally, 67 (47 up and 20 down) miRNAs in liver, 138 (55 up and 83 down) miRNAs in spleen, and 251 (15 up and 236 down) miRNAs in spleen were detected, as well as 30, 60, 139 kinds of immune-related miRNAs belonging to 22, 35 and 66 families of the three tissues respectively. The expressions of 8 immune-related miRNA family members were found in all the three tissues, including miR-10, miR-133, miR-22 and etc. Some miRNAs have been identified involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, such as the miR-125, miR-138, and miR-181 family. Ten miRNA families with antioxidant target genes were also discovered, including miR-125, miR-1306, and miR-138, etc. Results from Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis further confirmed there are a majority immune response targets of the miRNAs involved in the EP treatment process. Our study deepened understanding roles of miRNAs in fish immune system and provides new ideas for the study of immune mechanism of EP.",

      "abstract": "Echinacea purpurea is traditionally used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory capacity of E. purpurea dichloromethanolic (DE) and ethanolic extracts obtained from flowers and roots (R). To identify the class of compounds responsible for the strongest bioactivity, the extracts were fractionated into phenol/carboxylic acid (F1) and alkylamide fraction (F2). The chemical fingerprint of bioactive compounds in the fractions was evaluated by LC-HRMS. E. purpurea extracts and fractions significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6 and/or tumor necrosis factor) and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Dichloromethanolic extract obtained from roots (DE-R) demonstrated the strongest anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, fractions exhibited greater anti-inflammatory activity than whole extract. Indeed, alkylamides must be the main compounds responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of extracts; thus, the fractions presenting high content of these compounds presented greater bioactivity. It was demonstrated that alkylamides exert their anti-inflammatory activity through the downregulation of the phosphorylation of p38, ERK 1/2, STAT 3, and/or NF-κB signaling pathways, and/or downregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 expression. E. purpurea extracts and fractions, mainly DE-R-F2, are promising and powerful plant-based anti-inflammatory formulations that can be further used as a basis for the treatment of inflammatory diseases."

Time Kill Kinetics (TKK) assays and the determination on swimming and swarming motility for 48 h gave more details on the mode of action of EAP solution. The results highlighted the presence of some terpenes and a large number of compounds belonging to different chemical classes. Among these, sugars and organic acids excelled. The EAP hydroalcoholic solution exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity in terms of MIC, with a clear decrease in the cellular load after 48 h. However, the bacterial motility may not be affected by the EAP treatment, displaying a dynamic swarming and swimming motility capacity over time. Given the complexity of chemical profile and the strong antimicrobial effectiveness, the EAP hydroalcoholic solution can be considered a source of bioactive molecules, deserving further investigation for the versatility of application.",

In the presented study, the best conditions for ultrasound-assisted extraction of caffeic acid derivatives (caftaric and cichoric acid) (TPA-opt extract), as well as the conditions best suited for preparation of the extract with high radical scavenging activity (RSA-opt extract), from E. purpurea aerial parts were determined. A Box-Behnken design based on glycerol content (%, w/w), temperature (°C), ultrasonication power (W) and time (min) as independent variables was performed. Antioxidant, antiaging and wound healing effects of the two prepared extracts were evaluated. The results demonstrate that glycerol extraction is a fast and efficient method for preparation of the extracts with excellent radical scavenging, Fe2+ chelating and antioxidant abilities. Furthermore, the extracts demonstrated notable collagenase, elastase and tyrosinase inhibitory activity, indicating their antiaging properties. Well-pronounced hyaluronidase-inhibitory activities, with IC50 values lower than 30 μL extract/mL, as well as the ability to promote scratch closure in HaCaT keratinocyte monolayers, even in concentrations as low as 2.5 μL extract/mL (for RSA-opt), demonstrate promising wound healing effects of E. purpurea. The fact that the investigated extracts were prepared using glycerol, a non-toxic and environmentally friendly solvent, widely used in cosmetics, makes them suitable for direct use in specialized cosmeceutical formulations.",

Echinacea can exert its immunomodulatory effect in various ways, but its influence on intestinal flora is unclear. METHODS: Therefore, we investigated the effect of Echinacea extract (EE) on gut microbiota in immunosuppressed ducks by 16s-RNA sequencing in this experiment. RESULTS: The results showed that EE significantly improved the weight gain of immunosuppressed ducks (p<0.001). It also increased the immune organ index (p<0.01) and upregulated the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ (p<0.05) as well as IL-2 in the serum. The lesions of the bursa were evident compared to the spleen and thymus. After treatment in the EE group, the lymphocyte count of the bursa returned to healthy levels and the lesions were significantly improved. The diversity analysis showed that neither of the alpha-diversity indices showed a significant difference (p>0.05). However, the EE group had a trend closer to the healthy group compared to the M group. β-diversity analysis revealed a high degree of sample separation between the healthy and immunosuppressed groups. The sequencing result showed a significantly higher relative abundance of Prevotella and Prevotella_UCG_001 in the dexamethasone-treated group, which could be potential biomarkers of dexamethasone-induced immunosuppression. EE increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia, Bacteroides, and Alistipes and significantly decreased the relative abundance of Megamonas, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The results showed that Echinacea extract improves the development of immunosuppressed ducks and modulates intestinal immune function by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacterial genera in the intestine."

Therefore, there is a growing concern about employing herbal medicine to limit AD progression & improve patients' life quality, thus potentiating its add-on therapy. In addition, herbs are cost-effective & accessible with nearly no side effects. In the same vein, our study aimed to investigate the potency of Echinacea purpurea (EP) flower extracts to ameliorate the neurodegenerative effect of Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) in a rat model. Moreover, mechanistic studies, including impact on the cholinesterase activity, redox status, inflammatory mediators, behavior performance, glucose level & histopathology, were carried on. Our results showed that 250 mg/kg of Aqueous (AQ) & Alcoholic (AL) extracts of EP inhibited cholinesterase, restored oxidative balance, down-regulated IL-6 & TNF-α cytokines & improved behavior performance in vivo that was reflected in the brain picture by decreasing neuronal degeneration & amyloid plaques in cerebral cortex & hippocampus. The potency of both extracts was compared to reference drugs & AlCl3 positive control group. The AQ extract showed greater potency against COX-1, COX-2 & α-amylase in vitro, while the AL extract was more potent against cholinesterase in vitro, inflammatory cytokines, behavior & pathological improvement in vivo. Conclusively EP overcame AlCl3-induced neurobehavioral toxicity in the rat model via different pathways, which support its regular administration to postpone progressive neural damage in AD patients.",

Since, both pain and discomfort are observed in patients with the erosive type, many drugs have been studied to alleviate pain and clinical symptoms. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of systemic Echinacea on clinical indices of OLP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 70 patients with erosive OLP were randomly divided into two groups, and each was treated with Echinacea tablets or placebo, 3 times a day, for 35 days. In addition, betamethasone lotion (0.1%) or nystatin (100,000 units) mouthwash were used by patients. The pain severity (visual analog scale [VAS]), lesion size, and the number of lesions were assessed at baseline and on days 10, 25, and 35 after study initiation. Finally, the obtained data were analyzed by statistical software, and Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon test, KaplanMeier, Chi-squared, and paired t-test. RESULTS: The VAS scores in the Echinacea group were significantly reduced at each visit compared to the placebo group (P < 0.001). We observed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: We showed that Echinacea is an effective and complementary therapy for OLP. Furthermore, in short-term usage, Echinacea is almost completely tolerable."

Echinacea purpurea n-hexane extract (EP4 -RE ; rich in alkamides) and butanolic extract (EP4 -RBU ; rich in polyphenols) have been characterized and tested in an in vivo model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain, addressing the endocannabinoid system with alkamides and counteracting the redox imbalance with polyphenols. Thermal hypersensitivity was evaluated by the Cold Plate test. EP4 -RE showed a dose-dependent anti-hyperalgesic profile. The extract was more effective than its main constituent, dodeca-2 E,4 E,8Z,10 E/Z-tetraenoic acid isobutylamide (18 mg kg-1 , twofold to equimolar EP4 -RE 30 mg kg-1 ), suggesting a synergy with other extract constituents. Administration of cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor-selective antagonist completely blocked the anti-allodynic effect of EP4 -RE , differently from the antagonism of CB1 receptors. EP4 -RBU (30 mg kg-1 ) exhibited anti-neuropathic properties too. The effect was mainly exerted by chicoric acid, which administered alone (123 μg kg-1 , equimolar to EP4 -RBU 30 mg kg-1 ) completely reverted oxaliplatin-induced allodynia. A synergy between different polyphenols in the extract had not been highlighted. Echinacea extracts have therapeutic potential in the treatment of neuropathic pain, through both alkamides CB2-selective activity and polyphenols protective properties.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the laboratory parameters of male and female Magellanic penguins and to determine the penguins' hematological response to homeopathic medicines during that reproductive period. METHODS: Penguins (N = 18), kept under human care in a zoological park setting, were evaluated during the reproductive period and were divided randomly into two groups: a group subjected to treatment with Echinacea angustifolia 6cH and Avena sativa 6cH (N = 8; four breeding couples), and a placebo control group (N = 10; five breeding couples). The investigators were blinded to treatment allocation. Two-way ANOVA was performed to determine whether the experimental group (control or verum) and the sex of the animal had any significant effect on the variation of each hematological parameter between the samples. One-way ANOVA was performed on hematological parameters for which the sex did not present a significant effect. The significance level was p ≤0.05. RESULTS: Significant effects were seen regarding the following: mean corpuscular volume (MCV), in which the verum group showed an increase (29.78 ± 52.95 fL) while the control group showed stability/reduction (-3.08 ± 46.36 fL) (p = 0.049); proportion of heterophils, in which the verum group showed a less marked increase (8.38 ± 12.53%) than that of the control group (18.00 ± 9.37%) (p = 0.010); lymphocyte concentration, in which the verum group showed less marked reduction (-4.39 ± 2.21 × 109 cells/L) than that of the control group (-1.56 ± 2.76 × 109 cells/L) (p = 0.001); and proportion of lymphocytes, in which the verum group showed a less marked reduction (-6.75 ± 10.35%) than that of the control group (-17.3 ± 8.73%) (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Comparison of samples collected before and during the reproductive period showed that, regardless of group allocation, there were differences in the effects on MCV, heterophils and lymphocytes. Treatment with Echinacea angustifolia and Avena sativa resulted in maintenance of lymphocyte levels in Magellanic penguins during the breeding period, thus aiding these birds' immunity.",

OBJECTIVES: Safe and alternative anti-coccidial drugs are herbal extracts because they do not result in tissue residue and drug resistance. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the anti-coccidial effect of the herbal mixture, a complex of two plants (Echinacea purpurea, Glycyrrhiza glabra) in broiler chickens in comparison with toltrazuril. METHODS: One hundred twenty broiler chickens were used in this experiment and divided into 4 equally numbered groups. All the groups, except Group D, were experimentally infected with mixed Eimeria spp. (E. Tenella, E. maxima, E. necatrix and E. brunetti) on day 14. Group A treated with an herbal mixture [Glycyrrhiza glabra Extract 5% (standardised to 5.4% glycyrrhizic acid) and Echinacea purpurea Extract 2% (standardised to 4% total phenolic content based on chlorogenic acid); Coxinin-EC® ; Shamim Teb Sepid Giti]. Group B treated with toltrazuril. Group C was experimentally infected with mixed Eimeria spp. but they did not have any treatment, this group was our positive control. Performance indices, faecal oocyst excretion, and intestinal lesion score were determined during the experiment. RESULTS: Positive control group had the poorest results and more mortality than other groups. Group D was not infected and was healthy all the experiment period. Treatment with herbal complex significantly reduced the negative performance and pathogenic effects associated with Eimeria spp. at a level that was comparable with toltrazuril. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the anti-coccidial activity of the studied herbal complex suggests its use as an alternative anti-coccidial agent to chemotherapeutic drugs for controlling coccidiosis in poultry. HIGHLIGHTS: -Coccidiosis is an important infectious disease that causes serious financial loss to the poultry industry. -Chemical anti-coccidial drugs and vaccines are the main control strategies to combat the disease. However, these tools have some constraints. -Herbal remedies are suitable alternatives to chemical compounds for control of losses associated with coccidiosis in poultry. -An herbal mixture (Echinacea purpurea, Glycyrrhiza glabra) has promising effects for controlling of coccidiosis in broiler chickens.",

      "abstract": "Experimental evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is a key pathological event of many diseases affecting the nervous system. It has been well recognized that these devastating illnesses (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, depression, and chronic pain) are multifactorial, involving many pathogenic mechanisms, reason why pharmacological treatments are unsatisfactory. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a vegetal mixture capable of offering a multiple approach required to manage the multifactoriality of neuroinflammation. A mixture composed of Zingiber officinale (150 mg kg-1), Echinacea purpurea (20 mg kg-1), and Centella asiatica (200 mg kg-1) was tested in a mouse model of systemic neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg kg-1). Repeated treatment with the vegetal mixture was able to completely counteract thermal and mechanical allodynia as reported by the Cold plate and von Frey tests, respectively, and to reduce the motor impairments as demonstrated by the Rota rod test. Moreover, the mixture was capable of neutralizing the memory loss in the Passive avoidance test and reducing depressive-like behavior in the Porsolt test, while no efficacy was shown in decreasing anhedonia as demonstrated by the Sucrose preference test. Finally, LPS stimulation caused a significant increase in the activation of glial cells, of the central complement proteins and of inflammatory cytokines in selected regions of the central nervous system (CNS), which were rebalanced in animals treated with the vegetal mixture. In conclusion, the vegetal mixture tested thwarted the plethora of symptoms evoked by LPS, thus being a potential candidate for future investigations in the context of neuroinflammation."

      "abstract": "Environmental and occupational exposure to chromium compounds, especially hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], is widely recognized as a potential nephrotoxic in humans and animals. Its toxicity is associated with the overproduction of free radicals, which induces oxidative damage. Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench is an herbaceous perennial plant rich in phenolic components and frequently used for its medicinal benefits. The current work evaluated the effectiveness of E. purpurea (EP) against oxidative stress and nephrotoxicity induced by potassium dichromate in male rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, E. purpurea (EP; 50 mg/kg; once daily for 3 weeks), hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI); 15 mg/kg; single intraperitoneal dose), and EP + Cr(VI) where rats were pretreated with EP for 3 weeks before receiving CrVI, respectively. Results revealed that rats exposed to Cr(VI) showed a significant increase in PC, TBARS, and H2 O2 , kidney function biomarkers (Urea, creatinine, and uric acid), lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH), TNF-α, IL-18, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), and IGF-1 (Insulin-like growth factor-1) levels as well as a considerable decline in metallothionein (MT), glutathione (GSH) content, enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, and GST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities, and protein content. Cr(VI) induced apoptosis in kidney tissues as revealed by upregulation of Bax and caspase 3 and downregulation of Bcl-2. Furthermore, EP treatment ameliorated the Cr(VI)-induced histopathological and ultrastructure variations of kidney tissue, which was confirmed by the biochemical and molecular data. It is clear from the results of this study that EP exerts nephroprotective effects by improving the redox state, suppressing inflammatory reaction and cell apoptosis as well as ameliorating the performance of kidney tissue architecture, which is eventually reflected by the improvement of kidney function in rats.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Echinacea angustifolia and purpurea have known immunomodulatory effects which boost viral clearance, including HPV infection. However, evidence regarding the improvement due to Echinacea-based supplements of cervical HPV-related pathologies is still lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Echinacea supplementation on the remission of cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL). Materials and Methods: A single-blind 1:1:1 parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Colposcopy Unit of a tertiary care referral center. Reproductive-aged women were allocated either to (a) an oral supplement based on Echinacea extracts plus vaginal hyaluronic acid-based soft gel capsules, (b) the Echinacea supplement alone, or (c) vaginal hyaluronic acid-based soft gel capsules alone for 3 months. The primary outcome was the regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-1 for each treatment arm at 3, 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included changes in the epithelialization, pap smear, colposcopic parameters, histological reports, and vaginal health indexes (VHI) in the study groups. Results: 153 women (52 for arm A, 50 for arm B and 51 for arm C) completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in both primary and secondary outcomes for the three groups after 3 months. At the 6-month follow-up, the number of persistent CIN-1 diagnoses was significantly lower in arm A (15/51), rather than in arm B (23/48, p = 0.03) and C (27/49, p = 0.03). Similarly, the same effect was seen after 12 months for treatment A (5/51) relative to B (15/48, p = 0.03) and C (14/48, p = 0.03). Colposcopic, histological and vaginal parameters were all significantly improved at 6 and 12 months for arm A relative to B and C, while no beneficial effects were seen after 3 months. Conclusions: Echinacea extracts supplementation in women with L-SIL/CIN-1 significantly boosts HPV lesion clearance, reducing the overall amount of diagnosis, histological, colposcopic and vaginal parameters after 6 and 12 months. However, a limited sample size reduces the quality of evaluated evidence, emphasizing the need for additional studies to validate these findings.",

In addition, the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants increases the threat of uncontrolled dissemination and additional antiviral therapies are urgently needed for effective containment. In previous in vitro studies Echinacea purpurea demonstrated strong antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we examined the potential of Echinacea purpurea in preventing and treating respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in particular, SARS-CoV-2 infections. 120 healthy volunteers (m,f, 18-75 years) were randomly assigned to Echinacea prevention or control group without any intervention. After a run-in week, participants went through 3 prevention cycles of 2, 2 and 1 month with daily 2,400 mg Echinacea purpurea extract (Echinaforce®, EF). The prevention cycles were interrupted by breaks of 1 week. Acute respiratory symptoms were treated with 4,000 mg EF for up to 10 days, and their severity assessed via a diary. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs and venous blood samples were routinely collected every month and during acute illnesses for detection and identification of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR and serology. Summarized over all phases of prevention, 21 and 29 samples tested positive for any virus in the EF and control group, of which 5 and 14 samples tested SARS-CoV-2 positive (RR = 0.37, Chi-square test, p = 0.03). Overall, 10 and 14 symptomatic episodes occurred, of which 5 and 8 were Covid-19 (RR = 0.70, Chi-square test, p > 0.05). EF treatment when applied during acute episodes significantly reduced the overall virus load by at least 2.12 log10 or approx. 99% (t-test, p < 0.05), the time to virus clearance by 8.0 days for all viruses (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.02) and by 4.8 days for SARS-CoV-2 (p > 0.05) in comparison to control. Finally, EF treatment significantly reduced fever days (1 day vs 11 days, Chi-square test, p = 0.003) but not the overall symptom severity. There were fewer Covid-19 related hospitalizations in the EF treatment group (N = 0 vs N = 2). EF exhibited antiviral effects and reduced the risk of viral RTIs, including SARS-CoV-2. By substantially reducing virus loads in infected subjects, EF offers a supportive addition to existing mandated treatments like vaccinations. Future confirmatory studies are warranted."

Echinacea purpurea polysaccharide (EPP) is a homogeneous polysaccharide, which has been shown to mitigate ALD. However, the effects of EPP on gut microbiome and consequently on hepatic metabolism have yet to be explored. In this study, the microbiome and metabolomics were combined to explore the effects of EPP on gut microbiota and hepatic metabolism, and the relationship between both was further revealed by Spearman correlation analysis. Results exhibited EPP reversed alcohol-induced disturbances in gut microbiota, evidenced by increased abundance of Muribaculaceae, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides and decreased abundance of Escherichia_Shigella and Enterococcus. Besides, EPP promoted the production of n-butyric acid, a short-chain fatty acid that maintains the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Moreover, EPP improved alterations in hepatic metabolites, and characteristic metabolites such as Berberine and Ponasterone as well as key metabolic pathways, particularly Nitrogen metabolism, were identified. Furthermore, correlation analysis suggested significant associations between gut microbes and hepatic metabolites, which in turn confirmed EPP alleviated ALD via the gut-liver axis. Therefore, these findings elucidated in-depth mechanisms of EPP against ALD and provided a new target for intervention in alcohol-related diseases.",

Echinacea purpurea is a medicinal plant that shows good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activities. In this study, Echinacea purpurea ethanol extract nanoparticles (Nano-EE) were prepared by encapsulating Echinacea purpurea ethanol extract (EE) in chitosan-silica nanoparticles. Obesity (OB) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was induced by fed 40% high-fat diet and then anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus injury were performed to induce OA. The rats got different doses of samples by oral gavage. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of Nano-EE were 69.1% and 36.1%, respectively. The average size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (ZP) of the Nano-EE were 145 ± 11 nm, 0.24 ± 0.01, - 4.57 ± 0.44 mV, respectively. Furthermore, electron microscopic images showed that the particles were spherical and were slightly agglomerated. Moreover, it showed that the leptin content, expression of MMPs, cytokines level, NF-κB level, and iNOS production were decreased whereas collagen II expression was increased after treatment. Besides, Nano-EE ameliorated the pain caused by OA and reduced the proteoglycan loss in cartilage. These results indicated that encapsulated EE (Nano-EE) can ameliorate OA with a low dosage and are more effective than unencapsulated EE.",

      "abstract": "Echinacea purpurea has been shown to broadly inhibit coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This review discusses the available clinical evidence from randomized, blinded and controlled human studies. Two RCTs capturing incidence of viral respiratory tract infections during Echinacea preventative treatment were identified including coronavirus infections. Incidence and/or viral loads were measured by RT-PCR and symptom severity was recorded. In a first study, Jawad et al. collected nasopharyngeal swabs from adults (N = 755) over 4 months of continuous prevention. Overall, 24 and 47 enveloped virus infections occurred, including 21 and 33 coronavirus detections (229E; HKU1; OC43) with Echinaforce® extract (2400 mg daily) and placebo, respectively (p = 0.0114). In a separate study, Ogal et al. administered the same extract (1200 mg) or control for 4 months to children (4-12 years) (N = 203). Echinacea reduced the incidence of enveloped virus infections from 47 to 29 (p = 0.0038) whereas 11 and 13 coronavirus detections (229E, OC43, NL63) were counted (p > 0.05). Respiratory symptoms during coronavirus infections were significantly lower with area-under-curve AUC = 75.8 (+/-50.24) versus 27.1 (+/-21.27) score points (p = 0.0036). Importantly, viral loads in nasal secretions were significantly reduced by 98.5% in the Echinacea group, with Ct-values 31.1 [95% CI 26.3; 35.9] versus 25.0 [95% CI 20.5; 29.5] in the control group (p = 0.0479). Results from clinical studies confirm the antiviral activity found for Echinacea in vitro, embracing enveloped respiratory pathogens and therefore coronaviruses as well. Substantiating results from a new, completed study seem to extrapolate these effects to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections. As hypothesized, the established broad antiviral activity of Echinacea extract appears to be inclusive for SARS-CoV-2."

Encapsulation was first optimized by Design of Experiments, followed by the empirical study. The obtained niosomes were further characterized for the size and morphology using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Spherical niosomes had a diameter of 142.3 ± 5.1 nm, as measured by DLS. The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of E. angustifolia extract reached up to 77.1% ± 0.3%. The prepared niosomes showed a controlled drug release within the tested 72 h and a storage stability of at least 2 months at both 4 and 25 °C. The encapsulated E. angustifolia displayed up to 16-fold higher antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant K.pneumoniae strains, compared to the free extract. Additionally, the niosome exhibited negligible cytotoxicity against human foreskin fibroblasts. We anticipate that the results presented herein could contribute to the preparation of other plant extracts with improved stability and antibacterial activity, and will help reduce the overuse of antibiotics by controlled release of natural-derived drugs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Echinacea, one of the most popular herbs with double function of immunity and anti-inflammatory activity, has now attracted much interest for a possible alternative for the treatment of hepatopathy. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of Echinacea regarding its chemical composition, pharmacological action against various hepatopathy, and safety. METHODS: A comprehensive search of published articles was conducted to focus on original publications related to Echinacea and hepatopathy till the end of 2020 using various literature databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, and Web of Science database. RESULTS: Echinacea exhibited excellent activities in resisting a variety of hepatopathy induced by different causes in preclinical experiments and clinical trials by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, antioxidant defense mechanism, voltage-gated sodium channels, lipid metabolism, circadian rhythm, p38 MAPK signaling pathway, JNK signaling pathway, Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and Akt/GSK3 beta signaling pathways. The high efficacy of Echinacea is related to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. The main ingredients of Echinacea include caffeic acid derivatives, alkylamides, and polysaccharides, which have been well established in preclinical studies of liver diseases. Studies on acute and subacute toxicity show that Echinacea preparations are well-tolerated herbal medicines. CONCLUSION: Echinacea may offer a novel potential strategy for clinical prevention and treatment of liver diseases and related diseases. Extensive studies are necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms and establish future therapeutic potentials of this herb. Well-designed clinical trials are still warranted to confirm the safety and effectiveness of Echinacea for hepatopathy.",

      "abstract": "Historical ethnobotanies of indigenous peoples of the North American prairies reveal treatment of many painful conditions by Echinacea spp. Recent evidence suggests a pharmacological basis for such use as the bioactivity of E. angustifolia and E. purpurea is mediated, in part, through activation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Whereas the cannabimimetic effects of individual echinacea products and alkylamides have been described, the activity of crude extracts has not been compared between cannabinoid (CB) receptors or across species or genotypes. Moreover, few studies have explored echinacea's engagement of the ECS for historic treatments or new therapeutic applications in peripheral inflammatory pain. We hypothesized that 1) the in vitro effects of root extracts on CB receptor internalization would vary with species and phytochemistry, and that echinacea root extracts would reduce inflammatory pain in vivo through activation of the ECS. Root extracts of different E. angustifolia and E. purpurea accessions were prepared, analyzed by HPLC-DAD to quantify caffeic acid derivatives and alkylamides (AKA), and tested for agonist and antagonist activities using receptor redistribution assays. Linear regression of activity relative to phytochemistry identified predictive compounds that were assessed individually in redistribution assays. Extracts were evaluated in the Hargreaves model of chronic inflammatory pain in rats with co-administration of selective CB1/2 antagonists to gauge involvement of the ECS. CB receptor agonist activity varied among accessions of both species with linear regression revealing a significant relationship between CB1 activity and AKA2 for E angustifolia, and AKA 9 + 10 for E purpurea. CB2 activity was positively related with AKA 9 + 10 and total AKAs in E. angustifolia. Four isolated AKA demonstrated agonist activity in the CB2, but not CB1, assay. In the inflammatory pain model, oral administration of either E angustifolia or E. purpurea root extract produced dose-dependent analgesic effects that were partially reversed by co-administration of CB receptor antagonists. This study demonstrates that in vitro effects of crude echinacea root extracts on CB receptors is predicted by phytochemistry. In vivo, echinacea has potential applications for peripheral inflammatory pain such as arthritis and burns, reflecting the traditional uses of Indigenous North Americans."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Herbal remedies of Echinacea purpurea tinctures are widely used today to reduce common cold respiratory tract infections. METHODS: Transcriptome, epigenome and kinome profiling allowed a systems biology level characterisation of genomewide immunomodulatory effects of a standardized Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench extract in THP1 monocytes. RESULTS: Gene expression and DNA methylation analysis revealed that Echinaforce® treatment triggers antiviral innate immunity pathways, involving tonic IFN signaling, activation of pattern recognition receptors, chemotaxis and immunometabolism. Furthermore, phosphopeptide based kinome activity profiling and pharmacological inhibitor experiments with filgotinib confirm a key role for Janus Kinase (JAK)-1 dependent gene expression changes in innate immune signaling. Finally, Echinaforce® treatment induces DNA hypermethylation at intergenic CpG, long/short interspersed nuclear DNA repeat elements (LINE, SINE) or long termininal DNA repeats (LTR). This changes transcription of flanking endogenous retroviral sequences (HERVs), involved in an evolutionary conserved (epi) genomic protective response against viral infections. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results suggest that Echinaforce® phytochemicals strengthen antiviral innate immunity through tonic IFN regulation of pattern recognition and chemokine gene expression and DNA repeat hypermethylated silencing of HERVs in monocytes. These results suggest that immunomodulation by Echinaforce® treatment holds promise to reduce symptoms and duration of infection episodes of common cold corona viruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and new occurring strains such as SARS-CoV-2, with strongly impaired interferon (IFN) response and weak innate antiviral defense.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In children, up to 30% of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) develop into bacterial complications associated with pneumonia, sinusitis or otitis media to trigger a tremendous need for antibiotics. This study investigated the efficacy of Echinacea for the prevention of viral RTIs, for the prevention of secondary bacterial complications and for reducing rates of antibiotic prescriptions in children. METHODS: Echinaforce® Junior tablets [400 mg freshly harvested Echinacea purpurea alcoholic extract] or vitamin C [50 mg] as control were given three times daily for prevention to children 4-12 years. Two × 2 months of prevention were separated by a 1-week treatment break. Parents assessed respiratory symptoms in children via e-diaries and collected nasopharyngeal secretions for screening of respiratory pathogens (Allplex® RT-PCR). RESULTS: Overall, 429 cold days occurred in NITT = 103 children with Echinacea in comparison to 602 days in NITT = 98 children with vitamin C (p < 0.001, Chi-square test). Echinacea prevented 32.5% of RTI episodes resulting in an odds ratio of OR = 0.52 [95% CI 0.30-0.91, p = 0.021]. Six children (5.8%) with Echinacea and 15 children (15.3%) with vitamin C required 6 and 24 courses of antibiotic treatment, respectively (reduction of 76.3%, p < 0.001). A total of 45 and 216 days of antibiotic therapy were reported in the two groups, respectively (reduction of 80.2% (p < 0.001). Eleven and 30 events of RTI complications (e.g., otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia) occurred with Echinacea and vitamin C, respectively (p = 0.0030). Echinacea significantly prevented influenza (3 vs. 20 detections, p = 0.012) and enveloped virus infections (29 vs. 47 detections, p = 0.0038). Finally, 76 adverse events occurred with Echinacea and 105 events with vitamin C (p = 0.016), only three events were reported possibly related with Echinacea. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of Echinacea for the prevention of RTIs and reduction of associated antibiotic usage in children.

The effects of two herbal medicines namely Zingiber officinale and Echinacea on alleviation of clinical symptoms and hospitalization rate of suspected COVID-19 outpatients were examined. METHODS: A clinical trial with 100 suspected COVID-19 outpatients as participants was conducted. The participants were allocated randomly to two groups of 50 members. The intervention group received concurrent Zingiber officinale (Tablet Vomigone 500 mg II tds) and Echinacea (Tablet Rucoldup I tds) for seven days in addition to the standard treatment. The control group only received the standard treatment (Hydroxychloroquine). After seven days, alleviation of clinical symptoms and hospitalization rate were examined. In addition, 14 days after treatment, the hospitalization was assessed again by telephone follow up. RESULTS: The two groups were identical in terms of basic characteristics. Improvement level as to coughing, dyspnea, and muscle pain was higher in the intervention group (p value <0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the other symptoms. In addition, the hospitalization rate in the intervention and control groups were 2 and 6% respectively, which are not significantly different (p value >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the efficiency and trivial side-effects of Zingiber officinale and Echinacea, using them for alleviation and control of the clinical symptoms in COVID-19 outpatients is recommended.",

The cypselas (fruits) of E. purpurea were examined in order to investigate the presence, localization and potential function(s) of endophytic microorganisms. Electron and confocal microscopy observations showed that three different components of microorganisms were associated to cypselas of E. purpurea: (i) one endocellular bacterial component in the cotyledons, enclosed within the host membrane; (ii) another more generic bacterial component adhering to the external side of the perianth; and (iii) a fungal component inside the porous layer of the perianth, the woody and porous modified residual of the flower, in the form of numerous hyphae able to cross the wall between adjacent cells. Isolated bacteria were affiliated to the genera Paenibacillus, Pantoea, and Sanguibacter. Plate tests showed a general resistance to six different antibiotics and also to an antimicrobial-producing Rheinheimera sp. test strain. Finally, microbiome-deprived E. purpurea seeds showed a reduced ability to germinate, suggesting an active role of the microbiome in the plant vitality. Our results suggest that the endophytic bacterial community of E. purpurea, previously found in roots and stem/leaves, might be already carried at the seed stage, hosted by the cotyledons. A further microbial fungal component is transported together with the seed in the perianth of the cypsela, whose remarkable structure may be considered as an adaptation for fungal transportation, and could influence the capability of the seed to germinate in the soil.Key Points• The fruit of Echinacea purpurea contains fungi not causing any damage to the plant.• The seed cotyledons contain endocellular bacteria.• Seed/fruit deprived of the microbiome showed a reduced ability to germinate.",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing public health emergency. The pathogenesis and complications advanced with infection mainly involve immune-inflammatory cascade. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy relies on immune modulation, reducing infectivity and inflammation. Given the interplay of infection and immune-inflammatory axis, the natural products received attention for preventive and therapeutic usage in COVID-19 due to their potent antiviral and anti-immunomodulatory activities. Recently, Echinacea preparations, particularly E. purpurea, have been suggested to be an important antiviral agent to be useful in COVID-19 by modulating virus entry, internalization and replication. In principle, the immune response and the resultant inflammatory process are important for the elimination of the infection, but may have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and may play a role in the clinical spectrum of COVID-19. Considering the pharmacological effects, therapeutic potential, and molecular mechanisms of Echinacea, we hypothesize that it could be a reasonably possible candidate for targeting infection, immunity, and inflammation in COVID-19 with recent recognition of cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) mediated mechanisms of bioactive components that make them notable immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent. The plausible reason for our hypothesis is that the presence of numerous bioactive agents in different parts of plants that may synergistically exert polypharmacological actions in regulating immune-inflammatory axis in COVID-19. Our proposition is to scientifically contemplate the therapeutic perspective and prospect of Echinacea on infection, immunity, and inflammation with a potential in COVID-19 to limit the severity and progression of the disease. Based on the clinical usage for respiratory infections, and relative safety in humans, further studies for the evidence-based approach to COVID-19 are needed. We do hope that Echinacea could be a candidate agent for immunomodulation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."

Caffeic acid derivatives are considered the main active markers, such as chicoric acid, caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid. An analytical method using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and diode array detector was developed and validated, to quantify caffeic acid derivatives in commercial dried extracts of EP. UPLC method was developed using a C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm), at 30°C. Mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and 0.05% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution (10:90), flow rate 0.2 mL/min. Injection volume was 10 μL and detection was performed at 300 and 330 nm. The developed method complied with all required validation parameters, and showed to be linear, precise, accurate, selective and robust for all caffeic acid derivatives. Using the validated method, the levels of caftaric acid (0.110-0.507%w/w), chicoric acid (0.040-0.179%w/w) and chlorogenic acid (0.013-0.084%w/w) were determined in five commercial dried extracts of E. purpurea, with significant variation in the contents between different samples, indicating the need of standardization and control of individual caffeic acid derivatives in commercial extracts.",

The potential effects of such herbs on lung cancer cell growth, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, caspase activity and their cannabinomimetic properties on the CB2 receptor are addressed in the current study. METHODS: The cytotoxic effect of both herb extracts on the growth of lung cancer cells (A549) was assessed using the MTT assay. The annexin-V-FITC staining and propidium iodide (PI) staining methods were applied for the detection of apoptosis and cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry. The cellular level of ROS was measured using 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) as a fluorescent probe in flow cytometry. The caspase 3 activity was assessed using a colorimetric assay Kit. RESULTS: Echinacea purpurea (EP) root extract induced a considerable decrease in A549 viable cells, showing a time and dose-dependent response. The cell toxicity of EP was accompanied by induction of early apoptosis and cell accumulation at the sub G1 phase of the cell cycle. The elevation of cellular ROS level and caspase 3 activity indicate ROS-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis following the treatment of A549 cells by EP extract. The observed effects of EP extract on A549 growth and death were abrogated following blockage of CB2 using AM630, a specific antagonist of the CB2 receptor. Increasing concentrations of Cannabis sativa (CS) induced A549 cell death in a time-dependent manner, followed by induction of early apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at sub G1 phase, elevation of ROS level, and activation of caspase 3. The CB2 blockage caused attenuation of CS effects on A549 cell death which revealed consistency with the effects of EP extract on A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The pro-apoptotic effects of EP and CS extracts on A549 cells and their possible regulatory role of CB2 activity might be attributed to metabolites of both herbs. These effects deserve receiving more attention as alternative anti-cancer agents.",

Echinacea polysaccharide (EP) is an active ingredient that has been demonstrated to possess anti‑oxidative, anti‑inflammatory, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions. However, the role of EP in AKI has not been examined. The present study investigated the effects of EP on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced AKI. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses were performed to detect protein expression levels. Administration of EP significantly attenuated LPS‑induced renal tissue injury, along with a decrease in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. EP decreased the levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo‑oxygenase‑2 in LPS‑treated mice. Furthermore, LPS‑induced inflammation was inhibited by EP in renal tissues and HBZY‑1 cells, as demonstrated by the downregulation of tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6, nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 levels. Similarly, EP administration decreased oxidative stress (OS) via decreasing reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione levels, and increasing superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and reduced glutathione activity. Notably, EP induced a marked decrease in the expression levels of phospho‑extracellular signal‑regulated protein kinase (p‑ERK), phospho‑c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (p‑JNK) and p‑p38 in vivo and in vitro. In addition, in LPS‑treated HBZY‑1 cells, EP enhanced cell viability and inhibited nuclear translocation of p‑ERK, p‑JNK and p‑p38. Overall, the present findings demonstrated that EP alleviated LPS‑induced AKI via the suppression of inflammation, OS and the mitogen‑activated protein kinase signaling pathway, providing insight into potential avenues for the treatment of AKI.",

Here we evaluated the safety profile and treatment benefits of Echinacea in children with acute cold and flu symptoms. Methods: A total of 79 children (4-12 years) were randomized to a treatment regimen of three or five times daily Echinaforce Junior tablets (total of 1200 or 2000 mg Echinacea extract, EFJ) for the prospective treatment of upcoming cold and flu episodes at first signs. Parents recorded respiratory symptoms daily during episodes in their child and physicians and parents subjectively rated tolerability. Results: EFJ was used to treat 130 cold episodes in 68 children and was very well tolerated by more than 96% positive physician's ratings. EFJ-treated cold episodes lasted 7.5 days on average, with nine out of 10 episodes being fully resolved after 10 days. Five EFJ tablets daily reduced the average episode duration by up to 1.7 days (p < 0.02) in comparison to three EFJ tablets daily regimen. Effective symptom resolution finally contributed to a low antibiotic prescription rate in this study of 4.6%. Conclusions: EFJ tablets present a valuable option for the treatment of acute cold episodes in children showing a wide safety margin and increased therapeutic benefits at five tablets daily."

In our study, murine model of lung injury was induced with 2.5 mg/kg LPS before administration of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg EP. EP ameliorated LPS-induced lung pathological damage, along with reduction in lung wet/dry weight ratio and myeloperoxidase activity. EP decreased the number of leukocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and the release of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in LPS-treated lung. EP suppressed LPS-induced apoptosis along with down-regulation of Bcl2-associated X (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), and elevated B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Besides, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with EP 100 μg/ml for 1 h and then incubated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 24 h. TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels were lowered by treatment of EP in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, EP down-regulated the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), p-IκBα, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), p-NF-κB, and up-regulated the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) in vivo and in vitro following LPS induction, which is consistent with the effect of TAK-242. In conclusion, EP may alleviate LPS-induced lung injury via inhibiting inflammation, apoptosis and activation of TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway.",

In this study, the efficiency of traditional maceration using water and ethanol was compared with the maceration using mixtures of water and glycerol, a non-toxic, biodegradable solvent from renewable sources. It was found that the glycerol-water mixtures were as effective as ethanol/water mixtures for the extraction of caffeic acid derivatives. All the prepared extracts demonstrated notable antiradical properties. Furthermore, an efficient ultrasound-assisted extraction using glycerol-water mixtures was developed using six independent variables. Their levels needed for the maximum extraction of caffeic acid derivatives were as follows: glycerol 90% (m/m), temperature 70 °C, ultrasound power 72 W, time 40 min, and ascorbic acid 0 mg/mL. Under the optimized conditions, ultrasound-assisted extraction was superior to maceration. It achieved significantly higher yields of phenolic acids in shorter extraction time. The presence of zinc in plant material may contribute to the beneficial effects of E. purpurea preparations. Since glycerol is a non-toxic solvent with humectant properties, the prepared extracts can be directly used for the preparation of cosmetics or oral pharmaceutical formulations without the need for solvent removal.",

Currently, high sales of hydroalcoholic extracts of Echinacea have been reported; hence, the importance of studies on Echinacea. AIM: To establish the effects of Echinacea angustifolia DC extract obtained with ethyl acetate (Ea-AcOEt) in breast cancer cell lines. METHODS: Cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, and cell death were evaluated. Besides, the safety of the extract, as well as its effect in combination with paclitaxel were investigated. RESULTS: The echinacoside and caffeic acid content in the Ea-AcOEt extract were quantified by HPLC, and its antioxidant activity was assessed. The Ea-AcOEt extract showed cytotoxic activity on breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50 28.18 ± 1.14 µg/ml) and MCF-7 cells (19.97 ± 2.31 µg/ml). No effect was observed in normal breast MCF-10 cells. The Ea-AcOEt extract induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and caspase-mediated apoptosis. No genotoxicity was found in vitro or in vivo, and the extract showed no signs of toxicity or death at 2,000 mg/kg in rodents. In vitro, the combination of Ea-AcOEt extract and paclitaxel showed a synergistic effect on both cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: The Ea-AcOEt extract is a potential candidate for breast cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) were long thought to only cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms in humans but outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 have cemented their zoonotic potential and their capacity to cause serious morbidity and mortality, with case fatality rates ranging from 4 to 35%. Currently, no specific prophylaxis or treatment is available for CoV infections. Therefore we investigated the virucidal and antiviral potential of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce®) against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, highly pathogenic MERS- and SARS-CoVs, as well as the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, in vitro. METHODS: To evaluate the antiviral potential of the extract, we pre-treated virus particles and cells and evaluated remaining infectivity by limited dilution. Furthermore, we exposed cells to the extract after infection to further evaluate its potential as a prophylaxis and treatment against coronaviruses. We also determined the protective effect of Echinaforce® in re-constituted nasal epithelium. RESULTS: In the current study, we found that HCoV-229E was irreversibly inactivated when exposed to Echinaforce® at 3.2 μg/ml IC50. Pre-treatment of cell lines, however, did not inhibit infection with HCoV-229E and post-infection treatment had only a marginal effect on virus propagation at 50 μg/ml. However, we did observe a protective effect in an organotypic respiratory cell culture system by exposing pre-treated respiratory epithelium to droplets of HCoV-229E, imitating a natural infection. The observed virucidal activity of Echinaforce® was not restricted to common cold coronaviruses, as both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoVs were inactivated at comparable concentrations. Finally, the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was also inactivated upon treatment with 50μg/ml Echinaforce®. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that Echinaforce® is virucidal against HCoV-229E, upon direct contact and in an organotypic cell culture model. Furthermore, MERS-CoV and both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were inactivated at similar concentrations of the extract. Therefore we hypothesize that Echinacea purpurea preparations, such as Echinaforce®, could be effective as prophylactic treatment for all CoVs due to their structural similarities.",

      "abstract": "BRIEF OVERVIEW: Current evidence suggests that Echinacea supplementation may decrease the duration and severity of acute respiratory tract infections; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Few adverse events were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. Because Echinacea can increase immune function, there is a concern that it could worsen over-activation of the immune system in cytokine storm; however, clinical trials show that Echinacea decreases levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm. VERDICT: Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents.Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months.When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a significant role in the death of COVID-19 patients. While there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of cytokine storm, this evidence suggests that further research is warranted."

      "abstract": "Purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench) is a widely used medicinal and ornamental plant. In the present study, the callus embryogenesis was examined using benzyl adenine (BA) at three levels (3, 4, 5 mg L-1), 1-Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) at three levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg L-1) with or without activated charcoal (1 g L-1), coconut milk (50 ml L-1) and casein hydrolysate (50 mg L-1) in the MS (Murashige and Skoog 1962) medium. The embryogenesis indirectly occurred with the production of callus. The calli were observed in three forms: undifferentiated, embryogenic and organogenic. The embryogenic calli were dark green and coherent with a faster growth rate. The highest embryogenesis (100%) and embryonic regeneration (plantlet production) were obtained in the combined BA + NAA treatments with the activated charcoal, coconut milk and casein hydrolysate. However, the combined treatments of growth regulators failed to produce somatic embryos without the use of coconut milk and casein hydrolysate. The maximum amount of protein, peroxidase and catalase activity of embryogenic calli (2.02, 1.79 and 6.62ΔOD/Min/mg.protein, respectively), and highest percentage of acclimatization success (29.3% of plants) were obtained in the combined treatment of 5 mg L-1 BA + 0.5 mg L-1 NAA + activated charcoal + coconut milk + casein hydrolysate. The highest amount of chlorophyll content (33.3 SPAD value) and growth characteristics of acclimatized plantlets were observed in the media containing 3 mg L-1 BA + 0.1 and 0.2 mg L-1 NAA + 1 g. L-1 combined activated charcoal, coconut milk, casein hydrolysate. The histological studies confirmed the somatic embryogenesis in purple coneflower. Generally, it was found that the somatic embryogenesis of E. purpurea occurs at high levels of BA and low levels of NAA with the addition of coconut milk and casein hydrolysate.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: With the rise of antibiotic resistance, new strategies are needed to treat minor bacterial infections so that conventional antibiotics may be reserved for more serious conditions. One herbal formula, known as the HMPE formula, is often prescribed for minor infections. It includes Hydrastis canadensis (H. canadensis), Commiphora habessinica (C. habessinica), Phytolacca americana (P. americana), and Echinacea purpurea (E. purpurea). These herbs offer promise as treatments that may inhibit bacterial growth and stimulate the immune system. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial effects of the HMPE formula and its constituent herbs against two organisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. DESIGN: The research team performed an in-vitro study. SETTING: The study occurred at the Helfgott Research Institute at the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland, OR, USA. INTERVENTION: The study tested HMPE and each of its ingredients alone for antibacterial properties. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measure was a disc diffusion assay. Sterile paper discs were impregnated with 15 µl of E. purpurea, H. canadensis, C. habessinica , or P. americana as herbal tinctures; with the complete HMPE formula; or with 65% ethanol as the negative control, and dried at room temperature for 40 minutes. Commercially prepared 10 µg ampicillin discs were used as a positive control. RESULTS: H. Canadensis and, to a lesser extent, the complete HMPE formula significantly inhibited the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, but not the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. C. habessinica, P. americana, and E. purpurea alone did not inhibit growth of either bacterial strain. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that H. canadensis had antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, but the HMPE formula was not active against S. epidermidis, when a zone of inhibition threshold of 12 millimeters (mm) was used to determine antibiotic activity. Because the HMPE formula was shown to be less effective than H. canadensis alone, the formula might benefit from an increased percentage of H. canadensis.",

Fractionation of adventitious root cultures of Echinacea purpurea resulted in the isolation of eleven constituents, including three new compounds.

To discover new types of antiresorptive agents, we screened for new compounds that regulate osteoclast differentiation, and survival. Among three new compounds, echinalkamide (compound 1) had considerably inhibitory effects on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, and on proliferation of osteoclasts and efficiently attenuated osteoclastic bone resorption without toxicity. In addition, echinalamide treatment inhibited the osteoclast-specific gene expression level. Echinalkamide achieved this inhibitory effect by disturbing phosphorylation of MAPK and activation of osteoclast transcription factors c-Fos and NFATc1. Conclusionally, our study investigated that echinalkamide remarkably inhibited osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast specific gene expression through repression of the MAPK-c-Fos-NFATC1 cascade.",

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of combined use of oral Azithromycin (AZT) plus Echinacea compared to exclusive use of AZT in children with recurrent tonsillitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective comparative study including three groups of children with recurrent tonsillitis. Group 1: (100 patients) had no prophylactic treatment. Group 2 (100 patients) received [60 mg/kg] prophylactic dose of AZT divided as (10 mg/kg/day) over 6 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Group 3 (100 patients) received AZT as in group 2 plus commercially available Echinacea in a dose of 5 ml oral suspension; 3 times daily for 10 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of tonsillitis symptoms were assessed and compared in different groups. RESULTS: Group 2 and group 3 had significant less number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of assessed symptoms during 6 months of prophylactic treatment with significant better results in group 3 (i.e. AZT plus Echinacea) compared to group 2 (I.e. AZT alone). However; there was no significant difference in patients with any prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: The combined use of Echinacea with Azithromycin produced favorable outcome than Azithromycin alone in pediatric patients with recurrent tonsillitis.",

Participants were also administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). In the Echinacea group, state anxiety scores decreased by approximately 11 points by the end of the treatment period, whereas the decrease was around 3-points in the placebo group (p< 0.01). The effect maintained over the washout period. The difference from placebo was significant from the 7th day of treatment throughout. Changes were less robust with trait anxiety scores, but the preparation performed better than placebo in patients with high baseline anxiety. Neither BDI nor PSS scores were affected by the treatments. Adverse effects were rare and mild, and all were observed in the placebo group. These findings suggest that particular Echinacea preparations have significant beneficial effects on anxiety in humans.",

      "abstract": "A high level of the secondary metabolite chicoric acid is produced by intracellular Pi supply and extracellular phosphate limiting in Echinacea purpurea hairy roots. Chicoric acid (CA) is a secondary metabolite which is gained from Echinacea purpurea. It has been found to be one of the most potent HIV integrase inhibitors with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the low-biosynthesis level of this valuable compound becomes an inevitable obstacle limiting further commercialization. Environmental stresses, such as phosphorus (Pi) deficiency, stimulate the synthesis of chemical metabolites, but significantly reduce plant growth and biomass production. To overcome the paradox of dual opposite effect of Pi limitation, we examined the hypothesis that the intracellular Pi supply and phosphate-limiting conditions enhance the total CA production in E. purpurea hairy roots. For this purpose, the coding sequence (CDS) of a purple acid phosphatase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtPAP26, under CaMV-35S promoter was overexpressed in E. purpurea using Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain R15834. The transgenic hairy roots were cultured in a Pi-sufficient condition to increase the cellular phosphate metabolism. A short-term Pi starvation treatment of extracellular phosphate was applied to stimulate genes involved in CA biosynthesis pathway. The overexpression of AtPAP26 gene significantly increased the total APase activity in transgenic hairy roots compared to the non-transgenic roots under Pi-sufficient condition. Also, the transgenic hairy roots showed increase in the level of total and free phosphate, and in root fresh and dry weights compared to the controls. In addition, the phosphate limitation led to significant increase in the expression level of the CA biosynthesis genes. Considering the increase of biomass production in transgenic vs. non-transgenic hairy roots, a 16-fold increase was obtained in the final yield of CA for transgenic E. purpurea roots grown under -P condition compared to +P non-transgenic roots. Our results suggested that the expression of phosphatase genes and phosphate limitation were significantly effective in enhancing the final production yield and large-scale production of desired secondary metabolites in medicinal plant hairy roots.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phylloxanthobilins are tetrapyrrolic natural products that arise from the degradation of chlorophyll. Phylloxanthobilins have been discovered roughly 10 years ago in the leaves of deciduous trees, and are now considered a compound class with high and still unexplored potential of bioactivities. To date, however, there are no reports on the occurrence of phylloxanthobilins in parts of a medicinal plant used for pharmaceutical preparations. PURPOSE: The relevance of Echinacea purpurea as medicinal plant is undoubtedly high, and a large variety of pharmaceutical preparations is available on the market, mostly for the treatment of the common cold. Nevertheless, its phytochemical profiling has been limited to analysis for previously characterized substances, and this has not explained all its pharmacological efficacies. We therefore set out to investigate the occurrence of phylloxanthobilins in Echinacea purpurea. METHODS: Phylloxanthobilins in leaf extracts of Echinacea purpurea were detected using analytical HPLC. Identified phyllobilins were purified from plant material and characterized by UV/Vis, mass spectrometry, MS/MS, and confirmed by co-injections with previously published phyllobilins from different sources. The anti-oxidant activity of selected isolated phylloxanthobilins was assessed by an in vitro ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay; in addition, the ability to scavenge ROS in cells caused by hydrogen peroxide stimulation was determined by measuring H2DCF-DA fluorescence and by assessing cellular GSH levels. RESULTS: In extracts of Echinacea purpurea leaves, an unprecedented diversity of phylloxanthobilins was detected; surprisingly, not only in senescent yellow leaves, but also in green leaves with no visible chlorophyll degradation. Six phylloxanthobilins were identified and structurally characterized. The uptake of phylloxanthobilins by human endothelial kidney cells was demonstrated. When investigating the anti-oxidative activity of these natural products, a potent in vitro activity was demonstrated; in addition, phylloxanthobilins possess intracellular ROS scavenging ability and can prevent oxidative stress as assessed by total cellular GSH levels. CONCLUSION: Phylloxanthobilins are important constituents of Echinacea purpurea extracts, and our first exploratory studies hint towards promising bioactivities of these natural products, which may be relevant for understanding Echinacea efficacies.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cisplatin, one of the most effective anticancer drugs, is known to cause undesirable adverse effects, including immunotoxicity. Echinacea purpurea is an important medicinal plant with immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. We have investigated the protective effect of an herbal formulation (Immulant) containing E. purpurea extract against cisplatin-induced immunotoxicity in rats. METHODS: Forty mature albino rats were randomized into four groups (10 rats/group). Control (group 1) animals were subjected to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline solution (0.2 ml) once every 3 days. Group 2 animals received cisplatin (3.5 mg/kg, i.p.) once every 3 days for successive 2 weeks. Group 3 rats received oral Immulant (150 mg/kg) once daily for 2 weeks. Group 4 animals received oral Immulant treatment as in group 3 in addition to cisplatin as in group 2. Serum level of total protein and albumin, total and differential leukocytic count, phagocytic activity of monocytes, humoral activity and splenic histopathology and immunohistochemistry were used as diagnostic markers of immunotoxicity. RESULTS: Cisplatin induced marked inhibition of cellular immunity as exhibited by significant decrease of leukocytic count, lymphocyte percentage and phagocytic activity with marked increase in neutrophil percentage. Humoral immunity represented by marked inhibition in total protein and γ-globulin concentration and significant inhibition in antibody titer against Mycoplasma gallisepticum were recorded. Histopathological and immunohistochemical observation of the spleen of cisplatin-treated rats revealed obvious pathological findings of marked depletion and degeneration of lymphoid tissue. Co-oral administration of Immulant resulted in substantial improvement of various immunotoxicological indices compared to cisplatin control. CONCLUSION: The herbal medicine Immulant is an immunostimulant which could be used to treat the immunotoxic effects of cisplatin.

OBJECTIVES: To assess current evidence for the safety and efficacy of echinacea containing preparations in preventing and treating upper respiratory tract infection. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CAB extracts, Web of Science, Cochrane DARE, clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP - 1980 to present day. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials using an echinacea preparation to prevent or treat upper respiratory tract infections. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Participants who are otherwise healthy of any age and sex. We considered any echinacea containing preparation. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used the Cochrane collaborations tool for quality assessment of included studies and performed three meta-analyses; on the prevention, duration and safety of echinacea. RESULTS: For the prevention of upper respiratory tract infection using echinacea we found a risk ratio of 0.78 [95% CI 0.68-0.88], for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection using echinacea we found a mean difference in average duration of -0.45 [95% 1.85-0.94] days, finally for the safety meta-analyses we found a risk ratio of 1.09 [95% CI 0.95-1.25]. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of our review include the clinical heterogeneity - for example many different preparations were tested, the risk of selective reporting, deviations from our protocol and lack of contact with study authors. CONCLUSIONS: Our review presents evidence that echinacea might have a preventative effect on the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections but whether this effect is clinically meaningful is debatable. We did not find any evidence for an effect on the duration of upper respiratory tract infections. Regarding the safety of echinacea no risk is apparent in the short term at least. The strength of these conclusions is limited by the risk of selective reporting and methodological heterogeneity. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Based on the results of this review users of echinacea can be assured that echinacea preparations are safe to consume in the short term however they should not be confident that commercially available remedies are likely to shorten the duration or effectively prevent URTI. Researchers interested in the potential preventative effects of echinacea identified in this study should aim to increase the methodological strength of any further trials.

      "abstract": "Introduction. HPV infection is a highly infectious disease; about 65% of partners of individuals with genital warts will develop genital condylomatosis. Only in 20-30% it regresses spontaneously and relapse rates range deeply (9-80%). Echinacea extracts possess antiviral and immunomodulator activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, using a formulation based on HPVADL18® (on dry extracts of 200 mg Echinacea Purpurea (EP) roots plus E. Angustifolia (EA)), on the posttreatment relapse incidence of genital condylomatosis. Materials and Methods. It is a prospective single-arm study. Patients with a satisfactory and positive vulvoscopy, colposcopy, or peniscopy for genital condylomatosis were divided into two random groups and subjected to destructive therapy with Co2 Laser. Group A (N=64) immediately after the laser therapy started a 4-month treatment with oral HPVADL18®; Group B (N=61) did not undergo any additional therapy. Patients were subjected to a follow-up after 1, 6, and 12 months. Differences in relapse incidence between the two groups during follow-up controls were evaluated by χ2-test; the groups were stratified by age, gender, and condylomatosis extension degree. Results and Discussion. Gender, age, and condyloma lesions' extension degree showed no statistically significant differences between the two trial groups. The relapse incidence differs statistically between the two studied groups and progressively decreases during the 12 months after treatment in both groups. Statistically significant reduction of relapse rates has been shown in Group A in patients over 25 years old. This difference is significant for both men and women. The relapse incidence is superior in case of extended condylomatosis. Conclusions. In conclusion, the presence of a latent infection causes condylomatosis relapse; in order to reduce the relapse risk an induction of a protective immune response seems to be essential to allow rapid viral clearance from genital areas surrounding lesion and treatment zones. Echinacea promotes this process. EP and EA dry root extracts seem to be a valid adjuvant therapy in reducing relapse incidence of lesions in patients treated for genital condylomatosis.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of nitrogen on soluble protein, enzyme activities, carotenoids metabolism, greenness and biological yield of the Echinacea purpurea under different levels of irrigation. The experiment was conducted in a research field in Iran during 2013-2015. Irrigation treatments included irrigation after 25, 50 and 75% soil water depletion, and nitrogen sources were no nitrogen (N), nitroxin, 40 kg N ha-1, 40 kg N ha-1 + nitroxin and 80 kg N ha-1. Nitroxin is a biofertilizer including Azotobacter and Azospirillum. The activity of catalase (11.9-21.3 mmol g-1fw min-1), peroxidase (40.1-48.9 µmol g-1fw min-1), polyphenoloxidase (0.79-3.63 mmol g-1fw min-1) increased in both years under drought stress conditions. The lowest greenness (50.1-45.9) was achieved from no-application of nitrogen in the irrigation treatment after 75% water depletion. The results demonstrated the beneficial effects of nitrogen sources on physiological reactions, especially peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and carotenoids metabolism. It is concluded that irrigation of E. purpurea based on 50% water depletion and 80 kg nitrogen as well as the combination of nitroxin and 40 kg nitrogen treatments should be an appropriate choice for 2 years."

The purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench.) has been reported to have multiple biological effects, including immunomodulatory and antioxidant activity. The most active compounds of E. purpurea are polyphenols - caffeic acid derivatives: caftaric acid, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, echinacoside and cichoric acid. Due to a relatively limited number of studies on the use of the purple coneflower as a nutritional supplement for fish feeding, extruded fish feed with addition of Echinacea roots was produced. In the feed total phenolic content, selected polyphenol contents, the energetic value, nutrient contents and antioxidant capacity were examined. The results indicate that fish feed with addition of the Echinacea has a great potential to be a good source of natural radical scavengers, for example polyphenols, and nutritive ingredients. Antioxidant properties of feed were well correlated with the coneflower content. The study findings confirmed that high-temperature extrusion-cooking process does not deactivate phenolic antioxidant compounds, which are present both in the Echinacea roots and in the final product. Fish feed with addition of E. purpurea can be used as a nutritional supplement in the prevention of fish diseases caused by oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Chicoric acid is the main phenolic active ingredient in Echinacea purpurea (Asteraceae), best known for its immune-enhancing ability, as well as used as a herbal medicine. To achieve further utilization of medicinal ingredients from E. purpurea, an efficient preparative separation of chicoric acid was developed based on macroporous adsorption resin chromatography. The separation characteristics of several different typical macroporous adsorption resins were evaluated by adsorption/desorption column experiments, and HPD100 was revealed as the optimal one, which exhibited that the adsorbents fitted well to the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and Langmuir isotherm model, and the optimal process parameters were obtained. The breakthrough curves could be predicted and end-point could be determined early. Besides, the optimal elution conditions of chicoric acid can be achieved using the quality control methods. As a result, the purity of chicoric acid was increased 15.8-fold (from 4 to 63%) after the treatment with HPD100. The process of the enrichment and separation of chicoric acid is considerate, because of its high efficiency and simple operation. The established separation and purification method of chicoric acid is expected to be valuable for further utilization of E. purpurea according to product application in pharmaceutical fields in the future.",

To alleviate pruritus, lipid replenishing and rehydration of the skin is often unsatisfactory. Thus, products with additional antipruritic effects are needed. OBJECTIVES: Antipruritic effects and cosmetic properties of two different emulsions, water-in-oil (w/o) or oil-in-water (o/w), and a shampoo containing a lipophilic Echinacea purpurea root extract (Ec.-extract) were assessed in adults suffering from pruritus. METHODS: Adults (n = 55) with pruritus of the body applied a w/o emulsion for 2 weeks. In a separate study, adults (n = 33) with a pruritic scalp applied an o/w-emulsion for 4 weeks. In a third study, shampoo (n = 34) was applied for 4 weeks. Objective (erythema, dryness, and papules) and subjective (intensity, duration, and burden of pruritus) parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Treatment with the w/o emulsion significantly reduced erythema and dryness (P < 0.0001) as well as pruritus (in 93% of participants) on the body. Treatment with the o/w-emulsion on the scalp significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced objective (erythema in 61% and dryness in 85% of participants) and subjective (85% of participants had reduced pruritus) parameters. Similar results in reduction of dryness (76% of participants) and pruritus (70 % of participants) were seen after 4 weeks of shampoo use. CONCLUSION: Independent from the type of emulsion (w/o or o/w), cosmetic products containing a proprietary Ec.-extract significantly reduced objective and subjective parameters in adults suffering from acute or chronic pruritus exhibiting excellent tolerability."

To date, evidence from literature highlights an increase in immunological diseases and a great attention has been focused on the development of molecules able to modulate the immune response. There is an enormous global demand for new effective therapies and researchers are investigating new fields. One promising strategy is the use of herbal medicines as integrative, complementary and preventive therapy. The active components in medical plants have always been an important source of clinical therapeutics and the study of their molecular pharmacology is an enormous challenge since they offer a great chemical diversity with often multi-pharmacological activity. In this review, we mainly analysed the immunomodulatory/antinflammatory activity of Echinacea spp. and Curcuma longa, focusing on some issues of the phytochemical research and on new possible strategies to obtain novel agents to supplement the present therapies.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Echinacea on the treatment of aphthous ulcer. METHODS: 50 patients with minor aphthous participated in our study. 25 patients take 3 tablets in a day for five weeks (case group) and 25 patients didn't take any tablets (control group). The patients were monitored for one month before taking the tablets for six months. During this period, the number of lesions, complete improvement of ulcers, recurrence rate and intensity of pain were considered in each month. Finally, the Friedman and ANOVA tests used to analyze the obtained data. RESULT: Our study showed a significant difference between a number of lesions during six-month in case and control groups (p>0.001). In this way, we observed that the number of lesions was decreased significantly after six months in the case group. Hence, ANOVA analysis showed a significant decrease between each month for the intensity of pain (p=0.025), complete improvement (p<0.001) and recurrence rate (p=0.026). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we showed that Echinacea tablets as an herbal medicine have positive effects on a number of lesions, intensity of pain, complete improvement and recurrence rate in patients with recurrent minor aphthous ulcers."

Physical barriers and innate and adaptive immunity have been involved during a CC episode. Vitamins C and D, zinc, and Echinacea have evidence-based efficacy on these immune system barriers. This review includes 82 eligible studies to consider the preventive role of these nutrients in immune clusters and in CC to provide advice on dosage and assumption of these nutrients. Regarding vitamin C, regular supplementation (1 to 2 g/day) has shown that vitamin C reduces the duration (in adults by 8%, in children by 14%) and the severity of CC. Considering zinc, the supplementation may shorten the duration of colds by approximately 33%. CC patients may be instructed to try zinc within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. As for vitamin D, the supplementation protected against CC overall, considering baseline levels and age. Patients with vitamin D deficiency and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefit. Regarding Echinacea, prophylactic treatment with this extract (2400 mg/day) over 4 months appeared to be beneficial for preventing/treating CC. In conclusion, the current evidence of efficacy for zinc, vitamins D and C, and Echinacea is so interesting that CC patients may be encouraged to try them for preventing/treating their colds, although further studies are needed on this topic."

We used an extract of Echinacea purpurea (EP) as a natural source of antioxidant and free radical scavenging product for detoxification of MNP in testicular tissues. MNP localization in the interstitial area of testicular tissue reduced the expression of insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3) proteins as well as serum testosterone levels. Further, MNP caused accumulation of both collagen and elastin in the interstitial area and increased the thickness of the tunica albuginea. Injection of MNP during administration of EP extract for short periods slightly reduced the toxic side effects of MNP. After extended exposure to EP extract, INSL3 expression and testosterone returned to near control levels. Also, collagen and elastin accumulation caused by MNP was reduced after extended exposure to EP extract. We believe that the ameliorative effect of EP extract is due to its antioxidant properties.",

Echinacea treatment significantly increased the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the blood (P < .05). In addition, Echinacea restored serum cytokine levels, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interleukin-17 (IL-17), as well as the mRNA expressions of these cytokines in spleen (P < .05). Our findings suggest that Echinacea might have beneficial effects on restraint stress-induced immunosuppression by increasing splenocyte proliferation and NK cell activity, while modulating T lymphocyte subsets and cytokine levels in the blood.",

This study aimed at comparing the effects of two mouthwash solutions (echinacea and chlorhexidine) on the oral microbial flora of patients hospitalized in the intensive care units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this clinical trial, 70 patients aged between18 and 65 years undergoing tracheal intubation through the mouth in three hospitals in Arak, were selected using simple random sampling and were randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group and the control group. The oral health checklist was used to collect the data (before and after the intervention). The samples were obtained from the orally intubated patients and were then cultured in selective media. Afterwards, the aerobic microbial growth was investigated in all culture media. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The microbial flora in the echinacea group significantly decreased after the intervention (p < 0.0001) and it was also the case withmicrobial flora of the patients in the chlorhexidine group (p < 0.001). After 4 days, the oral microbial flora of the patients in the intervention group was lower than that of the patients in the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the echinacea solution was more effective in decreasing the oral microbial flora of patients in the intensive care unit. Given the benefits of the components of the herb Echinacea, it can be suggested as a viable alternative to chlorhexidine."

Today, various Echinacea spp. preparations are used primarily to treat upper respiratory infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of an ethanolic E. purpurea (L) Moench root extract and the alkylamide dodeca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide (A15) on mast cells, which are important mediators of allergic and inflammatory responses. Inhibition of mast cell activation may help explain the traditional use of Echinacea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A15 was evaluated for its effects on degranulation, calcium influx, cytokine and lipid mediator production using bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) and the transformed rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line RBL-2H3. Methods included enzymatic assays, fluorimetry, ELISAs, and microscopy. A root extract of E. purpurea, and low and high alkylamide-containing fractions prepared from this extract, were also tested for effects on mast cell function. Finally, we tested A15 for effects on calcium responses in RAW 264.7 macrophage and Jurkat T cell lines. RESULTS: A15 inhibited ß-hexosaminidase release from BMMCs and RBL-2H3 cells after treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 by 83.5% and 48.4% at 100µM, respectively. Inhibition also occurred following stimulation with IgE anti-DNP/DNP-HSA. In addition, A15 inhibited 47% of histamine release from A23187-treated RBL-2H3 cells. A15 prevented the rapid rise in intracellular calcium following FcεRI crosslinking and A23187 treatment suggesting it acts on the signals controlling granule release. An E. purpurea root extract and a fraction with high alkylamide content derived from this extract also displayed these activities while fractions with little to no detectable amounts of alkylamide did not. A15 mediated inhibition of calcium influx was not limited to mast cells as A23187-stimulated calcium influx was blocked in both RAW 264.7 and Jurkat cell lines with 60.2% and 43.6% inhibition at 1min post-stimulation, respectively. A15 also inhibited the release of TNF-α, and PGE2 to a lesser degree, following A23187 stimulation indicating its broad activity on mast cell mediator production. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Echinacea extracts and alkylamides may be useful for treating allergic and inflammatory responses mediated by mast cells. More broadly, since calcium is a critical second messenger, the inhibitory effects of alkylamides on calcium uptake would be predicted to dampen a variety of pathological responses, suggesting new uses for this plant and its constituents.",

The microRNA expression profile of HepG2 cells after EP treatment was evaluated and in silico target prediction was subsequently conducted to identify specific microRNAs with binding sites in the 3'-UTR of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Luciferase reporter gene assays and site-directed mutagenesis were used to confirm the binding site of identified microRNA within the 3'-UTR of the target gene. 3. EP increased ABCB1 (10-fold ± 3.4, p < 0.001) and ABCG2 (2.7-fold ± 0.5, p < 0.01) mRNA levels after 12 h exposure. Twenty-four microRNAs showed significant expression differences at all durations of exposure to EP. MiR-655-3p showed a 6.79-fold decrease in expression after 12 h exposure compared to 0 h, was predicted in silico to bind ABCG2 3'-UTR and showed a significant negative correlation (p = 0.01) to ABCG2 expression level. The binding of miR-655-3p to ABCG2 3'-UTR was confirmed by reporter gene assays (reduction of reporter gene activity to 60%; p = 0.0001). 4. These results suggest that EP regulates ABCG2 expression via downregulation of miR-655-3p in the liver cells.

There is still an unmet need for topical anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic substances exhibiting an excellent safety profile. The endocannabinoid system is known to regulate various aspects of cutaneous barrier and immune functions, thus targeting it may be a valid approach for alleviating the symptoms of AE. OBJECTIVE: To assess the putative efficacy of Echinacea purpurea-derived alkylamides (Ec. extract) activating cannabinoid (CB)-2 receptors in exerting anti-inflammatory effects and alleviating symptoms of AE. METHODS: In vitro anti-inflammatory efficiency was investigated by monitoring the effects of Ec. extract on poly-(I:C)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (Q-PCR) and release (ELISA) of HaCaT keratinocytes. Irritancy and sensitization potential (assessed by Human Repeat Insult Patch Test; Clinical trial 1); clinical efficiency in alleviating symptoms of AE (Clinical trial 2) as well as effects on human skin structure and lipid content (Clinical trial 3 followed by transmission electron microscopy and HPTLC) were investigated in randomized double blind clinical trials. RESULTS: Ec. extract significantly reduced mRNA expression as well as release of poly-(I:C)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in keratinocytes. Thus, not surprisingly, the well-tolerated (Clinical trial 1) Ec. extract-based cream reduced local SCORAD statistically significantly, not only compared to baseline, but also compared to the comparator (Clinical trial 2). Of great importance, besides the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects, administration of the Ec. extract-based cream also resulted in significantly higher levels of overall epidermal lipids, ceramide EOS (ω-esterified fatty acid+sphingosine sphingoid base), and cholesterol at Day 15 compared to baseline as well as significantly greater numbers of intercellular lipid lamellae in the intercellular space (Clinical trial 3). CONCLUSION: The investigated Ec. extract shows great potential in alleviating cutaneous symptoms of AE, and by exerting remarkable anti-inflammatory actions and restoring the epidermal lipid barrier, it will be very likely a well-tolerated, powerful novel ingredient for the adjuvant therapy of AE.",

      "abstract": "Echinacea is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of various diseases such as cough, respiratory infections, and bronchitis among other uses in Eastern Cape region of South Africa. This study evaluated the volatile components of the essential oil of the plant, its toxicity, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in rodents. Dried leaf and root of the plant were separately processed by hydrodistillation for 4 h and their essential oils (EOs) were collected. Extracted oils were subjected to GC/GC-MS analysis. The essential oil was further evaluated for acute toxicity, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. The toxicity profile of the essential oil was evaluated in mice through the oral route (p.o.), and anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated on the carrageenan-induced edema model in rats at the doses of 100-200 mg/kg, while its analgesic effect was evaluated on the acetic acid-induced writhings model in mice at doses of 100-200 mg/kg. GC/GC-MS analysis of EOs showed that a number of compounds identified in the leaf and root oils were 25 and 31 respectively. The chemical compositions of the oils varied and the major compounds identified in the oils include germacrene D, naphthalene, caryophyllene oxide, α-phellandrene and α-cadinol. The essential root oil did not cause mortality at the highest dose of 5000 mg/kg; hence, its LD50 was estimated to be ⩾5000 mg/kg, p.o. The anti-inflammatory test results showed that the essential root oil caused significant (p < 0.05-0.01) reduction in edema size compared to the negative control group on the carrageenan-induced edema and the results for the analgesic test showed that the essential root oil caused significant (p < 0.05) reduction in number of writhings at 1000 mg/kg compared to the negative control group. It is concluded that root and leaf of this Echinacea species contain volatile oils which varied in their yield and chemical compositions. The essential root oil is non-toxic orally and it demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in laboratory animals."

AIMS: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Echinacea purpurea in a combination therapy with glucantime in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydroalcoholic extract of E. purpurea was prepared from the plant. Amastigote form of L. major was inoculated to the tail base of thirty mice. After their tails became wounded, mice were divided into six groups. The first group was used as control and the second group received 100 mg/kg of Echinacea extract (orally). The third group was treated by meglumine antimoniate with dose of 20 mg/kg. Combination therapy was used for group four, five, and six where the mice received a different concentration of extract (100-200 mg/kg) and glucantime (10-20 mg/kg). The size of the cutaneous lesion on tail base was measured regularly. Findings were analyzed by SPSS software and using Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The sizes of the lesion were increased in all mice of control group by the time. The mean size of lesions in mice receiving the extract and/or receiving the extract along with meglumine antimoniate was lower than those of control mice, but the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). On the other hand, the differences between the group of mice which received meglumine antimoniate alone, and the rest of groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: E. purpurea extract in doses which have been used in this study and combination with meglumine antimoniate was not much effective against L. major in BALB/C mice."

This study investigated the effect of polysaccharide enriched extract of Echinacea purpurea (EE) on the polarization of macrophages. The results showed that 100 µg/mL of EE could markedly activate the macrophage by increasing the expression of CD80, CD86, and MHCII molecules. Meanwhile, EE upregulated the markers of classically activated macrophages (M1) such as CCR7 and the production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p70, TNF-αand NO. The functional tests showed that EE enhanced the phagocytic and intracellular bactericidal activity of macrophage against ST. Furthermore, we demonstrated that JNK are required for EE-induced NO and M1-related cytokines production. Together, these results demonstrated that EE can polarize macrophages towards M1 phenotype, which is dependent on the JNK signaling pathways. J. Cell.

Although studies have suggested the beneficial effects of this species against the influenza virus, no data are available on the use of E. purpurea aqueous extract in T. gondii infections. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of its administration in Swiss mice submitted to acute and prolonged infection with different T. gondii strains. This study showed that E. purpurea extract induced a significant reduction in the number of tachyzoites in the peritoneal fluid and liver imprints from mice infected by the RH strain. Moreover, prolonged treatment significantly increased the number of brain cysts of animals infected with ME 49 strain. The results obtained in this study suggest that the crude extract obtained from E. purpurea has important protective activities against infection with different T. gondii strains.",

      "abstract": "Echinacea is used for its immunostimulating properties and may have a role in modulating adverse immune effects of chemotherapy (i.e., use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); fluorouracil and its immunosuppressive effect). Patients may seek herbal remedies such as Echinacea (Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea) for immune stimulation. Echinacea extracts have been prescribed to supplement cancer chemotherapy for their immune-supportive effects; however, the extracts may also influence tumourgenesis. Our study aimed to determine the proliferative effect of the ethanolic blend of E. angustifolia and E. purpurea on various cancer cervical and bile duct cell lines, including HELA and QBC-939. Various cancer cells (HeLa and QBC-939) and human vein epithelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with the Echinacea blend sample that was evaporated and reconstituted in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). As the extract concentration of Echinacea was increased from 12.5 μg/mL to 25 μg/mL, there was an increase in cell inhibition up to 100%, which then reduced to 90% over the next three concentrations, 50 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL, and 200 μg/mL, in HeLa cells; further inhibitory effects were observed in QBC-939 cells, from 9% inhibition at a concentration of 25 μg/mL up to 37.96% inhibition at 100 μg/mL concentration. Moreover, this is the first study to report the growth-promoting effects of this Echinacea blend in HUVEC, up to 800% at a dose concentration of 200 μg/mL. Previous studies have suggested that chicoric acid of Echinacea spp. is responsible for the increased cell growth. The results of this study show that the hydroethanolic extract of Echinacea herbal medicine promotes the growth of HeLa cells and QBC-939 cancer cell proliferation, and may interfere with cancer treatment (i.e., chemotherapy drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and Cisplatin (DDP)). However, the Echinacea blend shows potential in neurodegenerative diseases with growth-promoting effects in HUVEC. Further animal trials (in vivo effect) measuring dose toxicology are necessary to demonstrate the interaction of this blend with body and tumor growth, and also any positive synergistic or adverse interaction with chemotherapeutic drugs listed, so as to confirm the current observation and epithelial tissue growth or regeneration in a neurodegenerative disease model."

We sought to chemically examine fungal endophytes inhabiting E. purpurea, and to identify compounds produced by these endophytes with in vitro cytokine-suppressive activity. Twelve isolates from surface sterilized seeds of E. purpurea were subjected to fractionation and major components were isolated. Sixteen secondary metabolites belonging to different structural classes were identified from these isolates based on NMR and mass spectrometry data. The compounds were tested for their influence on cytokine secretion by murine macrophage-type cells. Alternariol (1), O-prenylporriolide (4), porritoxin (10) β-zearalenol (13), and (S)-zearalenone (14) inhibited production of TNF-α from RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS in the absence of any significant cytotoxicity. This is the first report of a cytokine-suppressive effect for 4. The results of this study are particularly interesting given that they show the presence of compounds with cytokine-suppressive activity in endophytes from a botanical used to treat inflammation. Future investigations into the role of fungal endophytes in the biological activity of E. purpurea dietary supplements may be warranted.",

They have become very familiar immunostimulant herbal medicine. However, the specific immunomodulatory effect of Echinacea remains to be elucidated. AIM: In our study, the effect of Echinacea purpurea extract on the generation of immature DCs from monocytes was described, as well as its effect on DC differentiation. In addition, an in vivo experiment was conducted to investigate whether treatment of mice with extracts derived from E. purpurea has immunomodulatory effect on murine splenic DCs. METHODS: Immature DCs were generated by incubating peripheral blood monocytes with cytokine cocktail (GM-CSF + IL-4) and matured by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The cells were randomized to 5 groups to investigate E. purpurea effect in different stages. Phenotypic analysis of cell marker CD83-expressed on DCs was performed by flow cytometry. Mice were randomly divided into 3 groups; control, E. purpurea treated and E. purpurea-TNF-α treated group. The murine splenic DCs were isolated and phenotyped for CD83 and CD11c by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment of monocytes with E. purpurea prior to addition of the maturation factor TNF-α resulted in a significant decrease in the yield of DC expressing CD83. On the other hand, immature DCs generated in the culture in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4, when treated simultaneously with E. purpurea and TNF-α, exhibited an insignificant change in the yield of CD83-expressing DCs compared with untreated control. The in vivo experiments showed that splenic DCs obtained from mice treated with E. purpurea with or without TNF-α did not exhibit significant changes in CD83 or CD11c compared with those obtained from control mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the immunomodulatory mechanisms of E. purpurea impact generation fate of DCs rather than differentiation stages. The results obtained in the in vivo study utilizing murine splenic DCs supported those observed in vitro."

PURPOSE: The present clinical trial aimed to compare the antitussive effect of KJ with placebo (PL) and bromhexine (BH) among patients of 18-65 years old with non-complicated upper respiratory infections (URI; i.e., common cold). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a parallel-group, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in in 177 patients with acute URI over a 5 day period. METHODS: We investigated the antitussive effects of a KJ (30 ml/day; 762 mg genuine extracts with standardized contents of 0.2 mg/ml vasicine, 0.8 mg/ml chicoric acid, and 0.03 mg/ml eleutherosides B and E), bromhexine hydrochloride (24 mg/30 ml/day) and PL on cough and blood markers. The primary outcome was cough relief, which was assessed as the change of cough frequency from baseline (cough index). Secondary outcomes were safety with regards to reported adverse events (AEs) and hematological data. RESULTS: Both KJ and BH relieved cough more effectively than placebo. On the third and fourth days of treatment, we observed faster improvement in the group receiving KJ compared to in the groups receiving BH (100%) or PL (100%), indicating a slightly shorter recovery time in the KJ group. KJ showed a good tolerability and safety profile. CONCLUSION: KJ exerted significant antitussive effects in URI. The present data further support the therapeutic use of KJ in upper respiratory tract infections.",
