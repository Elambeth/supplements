      "abstract": "Seed longevity is important for the maintenance of seed nutritional quality, vigor, and germination potential during storage. Sacred lotus is known as one of the longest living seeds in the world and their ability to maintain longevity has been widely investigated. In this study, a suitable controlled deterioration treatment (CDT) method was first established to evaluate the vigor loss of lotus plumule (LP), and then the Tandem Mass Tags (TMT)-based proteomic analysis was performed on LP from the CDT-treated seed to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the protein profile dynamic. In total, 4002 proteins were successfully quantified, of them, 558 differently accumulated proteins (DAPs) were identified. Protein processing and RNA-related proteins were found more easily to be affected by CDT, which may directly result in seed vigor loss. Meanwhile, CDT resulted in remarkable up-regulation of numerous proteins related to antioxidation, photosynthesis, RNA and DNA stability, starch and sucrose mobilization, and cell membrane and wall stability, which potentially played key roles in maintaining the lotus seed vigor under CDT. Histological and physiological analyses were also performed to verify some proteome results. This study provided both fundamental data and new insights to further uncover the secret of lotus seed longevity. SIGNIFICANCE: Seed aging affects the seed quality and can result in direct economic losses. The exceptional longevity of sacred lotus seed has attracted extensive attention. In this study, an optimized CDT method was used to mimic the natural aging process of sacred lotus seed, and based on TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis on the LP profile of CDT-treated seeds, a series of differentially accumulation of specific proteins (DEPs) were revealed related to CDT resistance. Correspondingly, the physiological state and histological structure of the LP along with the CDT were detected to verify the proteome data. This study provided comprehensive information for the molecular basis of lotus seed aging analysis and facilitate to screen seed longevity related proteins for other plant species.",

      "abstract": "In this study, native lotus seed flour (N-LSF) was modified by different methods, namely, partial gelatinization (PG), heat−moisture treatment (HMT), or pullulanase treatment (EP). Their composition, functional properties, starch composition, and estimated glycemic index (eGI) were compared. PG contained similar protein, soluble dietary fiber, and insoluble dietary fiber contents to N-LSF, while those of HMT and EP differed from their native form. PG increased rapid digestible starch (RDS) but decreased resistant starch (RS); while HMT and EP increased amylose and RS contents to 34.57−39.23% and 86.99−92.52% total starch, respectively. Such differences led to the different pasting properties of the modified flours rather than PG, which was comparable to the native flour. HMT had limited pasting properties, while EP gave the highest viscosities upon pasting. The eGI of all samples could be classified as low (<50), except that of PG, which was in the medium range (60). It was plausible that lotus seed flour modified either with HMT or EP could be used as carbohydrate source for diabetes patients or health-conscious people."

      "abstract": "Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. 'Tielian') seed is long-lived and extremely tolerant of high temperature. Water content of lotus and maize seeds was 0.103 and 0.129 g H2O [g DW](-1), respectively. Water content, germination percentage and fresh weight of seedlings produced by surviving seeds gradually decreased with increasing treatment time at 100 degrees C. Germination percentage of maize (Zea mays L. 'Huangbaogu') seeds was zero after they were treated at 100 degrees C for 15 min and that of lotus seeds was 13.5% following the treatment at 100 degrees C for 24 h. The time in which 50% of lotus and maize seeds were killed by 100 degrees C was about 14.5 h and 6 min, respectively. With increasing treatment time at 100 degrees C, relative electrolyte leakage of lotus axes increased significantly, and total chlorophyll content of lotus axes markedly decreased. When treatment time at 100 degrees C was less than 12 h, subcellular structure of lotus hypocotyls remained fully intact. When treatment time at 100 degrees C was more than 12 h, plasmolysis gradually occurred, endoplasmic reticulum became unclear, nuclei and nucleoli broke down, most of mitochondria swelled, lipid granules accumulated at the cell periphery, and organelles and plasmolemma collapsed. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content of lotus axes and cotyledons decreased during 0 -12 h of the treatment at 100 degrees C and then increased. By contrast, the MDA content of maize embryos and endosperms increased during 5-10 min of the treatment at 100 degrees C and then decreased slightly. For lotus seeds: (1) activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) of axes and cotyledons and of catalase (CAT) of axes increased during the early phase of treatment at 100 degrees C and then decreased; and (2) activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) of axes and cotyledons and of CAT of cotyledons gradually decreased with increasing treatment time at 100 degrees C. For maize seeds: (1) activities of SOD and DHAR of embryos and endosperms and of GR of embryos increased during the early phase of the treatment at 100 degrees C and then decreased; and (2) activities of APX and CAT of embryos and endosperms and of GR of endosperms rapidly decreased with increasing treatment time at 100 degrees C. With decrease in seed germination, activities of SOD, APX, CAT, GR and DHAR of axes and cotyledons of lotus seeds decreased slowly, and those of embryos and endosperms of maize seeds decreased rapidly.",

      "abstract": "Antioxidant activity of hydro alcoholic extract of Nelumbo nucifera seeds (HANN) was studied using in vitro and in vivo models. Total phenolic content in HANN was found to be 7.61 +/- 0.04% (w/w). Characteristic HPTLC fingerprints of HANN were also made using different solvent systems. The HANN exhibited strong free radical scavenging activity as evidenced by the low IC(50) values in both DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl) (6.12 +/- 0.41 microg/ml) and nitric oxide (84.86 +/- 3.56 microg/ml) methods. The values were found to be less than those of rutin, the standard used. Acute toxicity of HANN was evaluated in Swiss Albino mice, no signs of toxicity were observed up to the oral dose of 1,000 mg/kg body weight. Administration of HANN to Wistar rats at 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight for 4 days prior to carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) treatment caused a significant dose dependent increase (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) in the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase and a significant decrease (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) in the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), when compared to CCl(4) treated control in both liver and kidney. These changes observed at 100 mg/kg body weight treatment were comparable to those observed for standard Vitamin E at 50 mg/kg treatment. Nelumbo nucifera seeds contain alkaloids, saponins, phenolics and carbohydrates. The results support significant antioxidant nature of HANN.",
