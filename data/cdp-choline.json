      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The SARS CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in more than 1.1 million deaths in the USA alone. Therapeutic options for critically ill patients with COVID-19 are limited. Prior studies showed that post-infection treatment of influenza A virus-infected mice with the liponucleotide CDP-choline, which is an essential precursor for de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis, improved gas exchange and reduced pulmonary inflammation without altering viral replication. In unpublished studies, we found that treatment of SARS CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2-transgenic mice with CDP-choline prevented development of hypoxemia. We hypothesize that administration of citicoline (the pharmaceutical form of CDP-choline) will be safe in hospitalized SARS CoV-2-infected patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (HARF) and that we will obtain preliminary evidence of clinical benefit to support a larger Phase 3 trial using one or more citicoline doses. METHODS: We will conduct a single-site, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and randomized Phase 1/2 dose-ranging and safety study of Somazina® citicoline solution for injection in consented adults of any sex, gender, age, or ethnicity hospitalized for SARS CoV-2-associated HARF. The trial is named \"SCARLET\" (Supplemental Citicoline Administration to Reduce Lung injury Efficacy Trial). We hypothesize that SCARLET will show that i.v. citicoline is safe at one or more of three doses (0.5, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg, every 12 h for 5 days) in hospitalized SARS CoV-2-infected patients with HARF (20 per dose) and provide preliminary evidence that i.v. citicoline improves pulmonary outcomes in this population. The primary efficacy outcome will be the SpO2:FiO2 ratio on study day 3. Exploratory outcomes include Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, dead space ventilation index, and lung compliance. Citicoline effects on a panel of COVID-relevant lung and blood biomarkers will also be determined. DISCUSSION: Citicoline has many characteristics that would be advantageous to any candidate COVID-19 therapeutic, including safety, low-cost, favorable chemical characteristics, and potentially pathogen-agnostic efficacy. Successful demonstration that citicoline is beneficial in severely ill patients with SARS CoV-2-induced HARF could transform management of severely ill COVID patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov on 5/31/2023 (NCT05881135). TRIAL STATUS: Currently enrolling.",

      "abstract": "Amanita phalloides poisoning is known to be the most fatal case among mushroom poisoning cases. Its main mechanism of toxicity is that it leads to cell death by the irreversible binding of its toxins to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II enzyme. This study was planned to analyze the effects of the CDP-choline molecule on Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning cases. The extract of the Amanita phalloides mushroom was taken and intraperitoneally administered to male Wistar Albino rats at a dose of 0.3 g/kg. In the experiment phase, the rats were divided into three groups of CDP-choline treatment according to the doses of 100 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg, and one control group was administered a 1 ml/kg dose of 0.9% isotonic NaCl solution. The treatments were then administered intraperitoneally at the 2nd hour, and at the 6th hour, the rats were sacrificed. The degree of damage in the liver and kidney tissues of the rats was evaluated histopathologically. It was concluded that CDP-choline reduced or prevented the damage that occurred in the liver significantly and dose-dependently in the toxicosis picture caused by Amanita phalloides, and it showed a tendency to lower or prevent the damage in the kidney, albeit not significantly.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis/endotoxemia associates with coagulation abnormalities. We showed previously that exogenous choline treatment reversed the changes in platelet count and function as well as prevented disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in endotoxemic dogs. The aim of this follow-up study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with choline or cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline), a choline donor, on endotoxin-induced hemostatic alterations using thromboelastography (TEG). Dogs were randomized to six groups and received intravenously (iv) saline, choline (20 mg/kg) or CDP-choline (70 mg/kg) in the control groups, whereas endotoxin (0.1 mg/kg, iv) was used alone or in combination with choline or CDP-choline at the same doses in the treatment groups. TEG variables including R- and K-time (clot formation), maximum amplitude (MA) and α-angle (clot stability), G value (clot elasticity), and EPL, A, and LY30 (fibrinolysis), as well as overall assessment of coagulation (coagulation index - CI), were measured before and at 0.5-48 h after the treatments. TEG parameters did not change significantly in the control groups, except for CI parameter after choline administration. Endotoxemia resulted in increased R-time and A value (P < 0.05), decreased K-time (P < 0.05), α-angle (P < 0.001) and CI values (P < 0.01) at different time points. Treatment with either choline or CDP-choline attenuated or prevented completely the alterations in TEG parameters in endotoxemic dogs with CDP-choline being more effective. These results confirm and extend the effectiveness of choline or CDP-choline in endotoxemia by further demonstrating their efficacy in attenuating or preventing the altered viscoelastic properties of blood clot measured by TEG.",

      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular impairment represents one of the main causes of death worldwide with a mortality rate of 5.5 million per year. The disability of 50% of surviving patients has high social impacts and costs in long period treatment for national healthcare systems. For these reasons, the efficacious clinical treatment of patients, with brain ischemic stroke, remains a medical need. To this aim, a liposome nanomedicine, with monosialic ganglioside type 1 (GM1), OX26 (an anti-transferrin receptor antibody), and CDP-choline (a neurotrophic drug) (CDP-choline/OX26Lip) was prepared. CDP-choline/OX26Lip were prepared by a freeze and thaw method and then extruded through polycarbonate filters, to have narrow size distributed liposomes of ~80 nm. CDP-choline/OX26Lip were stable in human serum, they had suitable pharmacokinetic properties, and 30.0 ± 4.2% of the injected drug was still present in the blood stream 12 h after its systemic injection. The post-ischemic therapeutic effect of CDP-choline/OX26Lip is higher than CDP-choline/Lip, thus showing a significantly high survival rate of the re-perfused post-ischemic rats, i.e. 96% and 78% after 8 days. The treatment with CDP-choline/OX26Lip significantly decreased the peroxidation rate of ~5-times compared to CDP-choline/Lip; and the resulting conjugated dienes, that was 13.9 ± 1.1 mmol/mg proteins for CDP-choline/Lip and 3.1 ± 0.8 for CDP-choline/OX26Lip. OX26 increased the accumulation of GM1-liposomes in the brain tissues and thus the efficacious of CDP-choline. Therefore, this nanomedicine may represent a strategy for the reassessment of CDP-choline to treat post-ischemic events caused by brain stroke, and respond to a significant clinical need.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive operations including pre-attentive sensory processing are markedly impaired in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) but evidence significant interindividual heterogeneity, which moderates treatment response with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. Previous studies in healthy volunteers have shown baseline-dependency effects of the α7 nAChR agonist cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) administered alone and in combination with a nicotinic allosteric modulator (galantamine) on auditory deviance detection measured with the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential (ERP). AIM: The objective of this pilot study was to assess the acute effect of this combined α7 nAChR-targeted treatment (CDP-choline/galantamine) on speech MMN in patients with SCZ (N = 24) stratified by baseline MMN responses into low, medium, and high baseline auditory deviance detection subgroups. METHODS: Patients with a stable diagnosis of SCZ attended two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and counter-balanced testing sessions where they received a placebo or a CDP-choline (500 mg) and galantamine (16 mg) treatment. MMN ERPs were recorded during the presentation of a fast multi-feature speech MMN paradigm including five speech deviants. Clinical measures were acquired before and after treatment administration. RESULTS: While no main treatment effect was observed, CDP-choline/galantamine significantly increased MMN amplitudes to frequency, duration, and vowel speech deviants in low group individuals. Individuals with higher positive and negative symptom scale negative, general, and total scores expressed the greatest MMN amplitude improvement following CDP-choline/galantamine. CONCLUSIONS: These baseline-dependent nicotinic effects on early auditory information processing warrant different dosage and repeated administration assessments in patients with low baseline deviance detection levels.",

      "abstract": "Antenatal steroid administration to pregnant women at risk of prematurity provides pulmonary maturation in infants, while it has limited effects on incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the clinical expression of hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI). Cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline) was shown to alleviate HILI when administered to newborn rats. Therefore, we investigated effects of maternal administration of CDP-choline, alone or in combination with betamethasone, on lung maturation in neonatal rats subjected to HILI immediately after birth. Pregnant rats were randomly assigned to one of the four treatments: saline (1 mL/kg), CDP-choline (300 mg/kg), betamethasone (0.4 mg/kg), or CDP-choline plus betamethasone (combination therapy). From postnatal day 1 to 11, pups born to mothers in the same treatment group were pooled and randomly assigned to either normoxia or hyperoxia group. Biochemical an d histopathological effects of CDP-choline on neonatal lung tissue were evaluated. Antenatal CDP-choline treatment increased levels of phosphatidylcholine and total lung phospholipids, decreased apoptosis, and improved alveolarization. The outcomes were further improved with combination therapy compared to the administration of CDP-choline or betamethasone alone. These results demonstrate that antenatal CDP-choline treatment provides benefit in experimental HILI either alone or more intensively when administered along with a steroid, suggesting a possible utility for CDP-choline against BPD.",

      "abstract": "Endotoxin shock is associated with severe impairments in cardiovascular and respiratory functions. We showed previously that choline or cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) provides beneficial effects in experimental endotoxin shock in dogs. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of choline or CDP-choline on endotoxin-induced cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunctions. Dogs were treated intravenously (i.v.) with saline or endotoxin (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before i.v. infusion of saline, choline (20 mg/kg) or CDP-choline (70 mg/kg). Blood pressure, cardiac rate, myocardial and left ventricular functions, respiratory rate, blood gases, serum electrolytes and cardiac injury markers were determined before and at 0.5-48 h after endotoxin. Plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), catecholamine and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured 2 h and 24 h after the treatments. Endotoxin caused immediate and sustained reductions in blood pressure, cardiac output, pO2 and pH; changes in left ventricular functions, structure and volume parameters; and elevations in heart rate, respiratory rate, pCO2 and serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, Ca and P). Endotoxin also resulted in elevations in blood levels of cardiac injury markers, TNF-α, HMGB1, catecholamine and NO. In choline- or CDP-choline-treated dogs, all endotoxin effects were much smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration than observed values in controls. These data show that treatment with choline or CDP-choline improves functions of cardiovascular and respiratory systems in experimental endotoxemia and suggest that they may be useful in treatment of endotoxin shock in clinical setting.",

      "abstract": "The detection of deviant auditory features is empirically supported as impaired in schizophrenia and has been shown to associate with functional outcome. Modulated by glutamate neurotransmission, this sensory process has also been shown to relate to the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) system, a prioritized molecular target for the development of novel cognition targeted pharmacological treatments. This pilot study assessed the acute effects of CDP-Choline, a choline supplement with α7 nAChR agonist properties, on the mismatch negativity (MMN), an event-related potential index of the detection of an acoustic change, in a sample of individuals diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia. Utilizing a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design, the dose-dependent (500 mg, 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg), baseline amplitude-dependent (low vs. high), and deviant feature-dependent effects of CDP-Choline on the MMN were examined. CDP-choline's effects interacted with dosage, deviance feature, and baseline amplitude with low baseline amplitude patients demonstrating enhanced MMNs, and high baseline amplitude patients demonstrating suppressed MMNs in response to CDP-Choline. These findings offer tentative support for the involvement of the α7 nAChR system in auditory MMN abnormalities in schizophrenia and supports further research assessing the effects of long-term treatment with CDP-Choline in the personalized treatment of auditory deviance processing impairments.

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: The combination of CDP-choline, an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) agonist, with galantamine, a positive allosteric modulator of nAChRs, is believed to counter the fast desensitization rate of the α7 nAChRs and may be of interest for schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. Beyond the positive and negative clinical symptoms, deficits in early auditory prediction-error processes are also observed in SCZ. Regularity violations activate these mechanisms that are indexed by electroencephalography-derived mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to auditory deviance. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: This pilot study in thirty-three healthy humans assessed the effects of an optimized α7 nAChR strategy combining CDP-choline (500 mg) with galantamine (16 mg) on speech-elicited MMN amplitude and latency measures. The randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and counterbalanced design with a baseline stratification method allowed for assessment of individual response differences. RESULTS: Increases in MMN generation mediated by the acute CDP-choline/galantamine treatment in individuals with low baseline MMN amplitude for frequency, intensity, duration, and vowel deviants were revealed. CONCLUSIONS: These results, observed primarily at temporal recording sites overlying the auditory cortex, implicate α7 nAChRs in the enhancement of speech deviance detection and warrant further examination with respect to dysfunctional auditory deviance processing in individuals with SCZ.",

In this study, effects of CDP-choline on the well known negative effects of Rapid Eye Movements (REM) sleep deprivation on learning and memory were investigated. Sleep deprivation was induced by placing adult male Wistar albino rats on 6.5 cm diameter platforms individually for 96 h according to flower pot method. Learning and memory performances were evaluated using Morris Water Maze (MWM) test during the same period of time. Saline or CDP-choline (100 µmol/kg, 300 µmol/kg or 600 µmol/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to the onset of MWM experiments. On completion of behavioral tests, rats were decapitated and hippocampi were assayed for total and phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (tCaMKII and pCaMKII, respectively) and total antioxidant capacity. We observed that while REM sleep deprivation had no effect on learning, it diminished the memory function, which was associated with decreased levels of pCaMKII and total antioxidant capacity in the hippocampus. CDP-choline treatment blocked the impairment in memory function of sleep-deprived rats and, increased pCaMKII levels and total antioxidant capacity. These data suggest that CDP-choline reduces REM sleep deprivation-induced impairment in memory, at least in part, by counteracting the disturbances in biochemical and molecular biological parameters.",

Associated with alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) dysfunction and shown to be improved with nicotine and α7 nAChR agonists, SG has recently been shown to be improved in low P50 suppressing SCZ patients following acute CDP-choline treatment. AIMS: This pilot study in healthy humans assessed the SG effects of an α7 nAChR strategy combining CDP-choline with galantamine, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of nAChRs, aimed at increasing and prolonging nicotinic receptor activity. METHODS: The combined effect of CDP-choline (500 mg) and galantamine (16 mg) on speech P50 gating indices rP50 (S2/S1) and dP50 (S1-S2) was examined in 30 healthy participants stratified into low and high baseline P50 suppressors in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and counterbalanced design. RESULTS: In low suppressors, CDP-choline/galantamine (vs. placebo) improved rP50 and dP50 gating, and reduced S2P50 amplitudes. No P50 gating effects were observed in high suppressors; however, CDP-choline/galantamine (vs. placebo) increased their S2P50 amplitudes. CONCLUSION: Findings from this pilot study with CDP-choline/galantamine in a healthy, SCZ-like surrogate deficient gating sample are consistent with the association of α7 nAChR mechanisms in SG impairment in SCZ and support further research trials with CDP-choline and galantamine targeting sensory processes.",

      "abstract": "Neural α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression and functioning deficits have been extensively associated with cognitive and early sensory gating (SG) impairments in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and their relatives. SG, the suppression of irrelevant and redundant stimuli, is measured in a conditioning-testing (S1-S2) paradigm eliciting electroencephalography-derived P50 event-related potentials (ERPs), the S2 amplitudes of which are typically suppressed relative to S1. Despite extensive reports of nicotine-related improvements and several decades of research, an efficient nicotinic treatment has yet to be approved for SCZ. Following reports of SG improvements in low P50 suppressing SCZ patients and healthy participants with the α7 agonist, CDP-choline, this pilot study examined the combined modulatory effect of CDP-choline (500 mg) and galantamine (16 mg), a nAChR positive allosteric modulator and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on SG to speech stimuli in twenty-four SCZ patients in a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled design. As expected, in low P50 suppressors CDP-choline/galantamine (vs. Placebo) improved rP50 and dP50 scores by increasing inhibitory mechanisms as reflected by S2P50 amplitude reductions. Results also suggest a moderating role for auditory verbal hallucinations in treatment response. These preliminary findings provide supportive evidence for the involvement of α7 nAChR activity in speech gating in SCZ and support additional trials, examining different dose combinations and repeated doses of this optimized and personalized targeted α7 cholinergic treatment for SG dysfunction in subgroups of SCZ patients.",

Changes in glucose metabolism associated with GSK3 inhibition may impact on lipid synthesis, whilst lipid metabolites can act as molecular response markers. METHODS: Here, SKBr3 breast and HCT8 colorectal cancer cells were treated with the GSK3 inhibitor SB216763, and [14C (U)] glucose and [3H] choline incorporation into lipids was determined. Cell extracts from treated cells were subject to 31P NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: SB216763 treatment decreased choline incorporation into lipids and caused an accumulation of CDP-choline which was accompanied by decreased conversion of glucose into lipid components. CONCLUSION: SB216763 profoundly inhibits phospholipid synthesis in cancer cells which demonstrate accumulation of CDP-choline detectable by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Metabolic changes in lipid metabolism present potential response markers to drugs targeting GSK3.",

METHODS: In a double-blind and placebo-controlled study, patients with stable schizophrenia (DSM-5) were randomized to receive either 2,500 mg/day citicoline or placebo in addition to risperidone for 8 weeks. The patients were assessed using the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS), and Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS). The primary outcome was the difference in PANSS negative subscale score reduction from baseline to week 8 between the citicoline and the placebo groups. RESULTS: Sixty-six individuals (out of 73 enrolled) completed the trial. The citicoline group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in negative scores, F(1.840, 118.360) = 8.383, p = .001, as well as general psychopathology, F(1.219, 78.012) = 6.636, p = .008; change in general psychopathology did not remain significant after adjustment, and total PANSS scores, F(1.633, 104.487) = 15.400, p < .001, compared with the placebo. HDRS scores and its changes, ESRS score, and frequency of other side effects were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Citicoline add-on therapy to risperidone can effectively improve the primary negative symptoms of patients with schizophrenia.",

This study analyzed the effects of citicoline (CDP-choline), a supplement with α7 nAChRs agonist properties, on SG in a sample of schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design the dose-dependent (500 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg) and baseline-dependent (deficient versus normal suppressors) effects of CDP-choline on SG were examined using the P50 event-related potential (ERP) index of SG. Overall analysis failed to demonstrate treatment effects but CDP-choline improved SG (500 mg) in the deficient SZ subgroup by increasing suppression of the S2 P50 amplitude. These findings tentatively support α7 nAChR dysfunction in the expression of SG deficits and suggest further trials to assess the effects of sustained α7 nAChR activation on SG with low doses of CDP-choline.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of action of CDP-choline with regard to matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the rat-transected sciatic nerve injury model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomized into Sham, Saline, and CDP-choline groups. Rats in Sham group received Sham surgery, whereas rats in Saline and CDP-choline groups underwent right sciatic nerve transection followed by immediate primary saturation and injected intraperitoneally with 0.9% NaCl (1 mL/kg) and CDP-choline (600 μg/kg), respectively. Sciatic nerve samples were obtained 1, 3, and 7 d after the surgery and analyzed for levels and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9, levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-3, and axonal regeneration. RESULTS: CDP-choline treatment decreased the levels and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas increasing levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 significantly on the third and seventh day after injury compared to Saline group. In addition, CDP-choline administration resulted in new axon formation and formation and advancement of myelination on newly formed islets (compartments) of axonal regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show, for the first time, that CDP-choline modulates MMP activity and promotes the expression of TIMPs to stimulate axonal regeneration. These data help to explain one mechanism by which CDP-choline provides neuroprotection in peripheral nerve injury.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may play an important role in early burn edema. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of cdp-choline on early systemic burn edema and leukocyte activation in shock in rat mesenteries after burn plasma transfer. METHODS: Burn plasma harvested from donor rats 4 hours after thermal injury (30% total body surface area, 100°C water, 12 seconds) was administered intravenously to healthy animals during 2 hours of intravital microscopy. Shamburn plasma (same procedure but water at 37°C) was transferred for negative controls. In the study group, bolus injection of 100 mg/kg body weight cdp-choline was undertaken 15 minutes before examination. Intravital microscopy was performed in the ileal portion of rat mesenteries at 0, 60, and 120 minutes. Capillary leakage was assessed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin extravasation and leukocyte-endothelial interaction were observed via transillumination microscopy. To assure comparable hemodynamic conditions, microhemodynamic parameters, foremost venular wall shear rate, were assessed. RESULTS: Capillary leakage increased significantly after burn plasma transfer when compared to the shamburn group. Additional intravenous administration of cdp-choline attenuates macromolecular efflux to shamburn levels. Leukocyte activation is reduced after cdp-choline treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The significant increase of albumin efflux in rat mesenteries after burn plasma transfer is decreased by additional cdp-choline bolus administration. Further investigations for proof of the relevance of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in early burn trauma are strongly required.",

Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 µmol CDP-choline and saline were administered to male Wistar-Albino rats. For the measurement of serum leptin and ghrelin levels, blood samples were obtained baseline and at 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min following i.c.v. CDP-choline injection. Equimolar doses of i.c.v. choline (1.0 µmol) and cytidine (1.0 µmol) were administered and measurements were repeated throughout the second round of the experiment. Atropine (10 µg) and mecamylamine (50 µg) were injected intracerebroventricularly prior to CDP-choline and measurements repeated in the third round of the experiment. After 1 µmol CDP-choline injection, serum ghrelin levels were suppressed significantly at 60 min (P=0.025), whereas serum leptin levels were increased at 60 and 120 min (P=0.012 and P=0.017 respectively). CDP-choline injections also induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in serum glucose and corticosterone levels. The effect of choline on serum leptin and ghrelin levels was similar with CDP-choline while no effect was seen with cytidine. Suppression of serum ghrelin levels was eliminated through mecamylamine pretreatment while a rise in leptin was prevented by both atropine and mecamylamine pretreatments. In conclusion; centrally injected CDP-choline suppressed serum ghrelin levels while increasing serum leptin levels. The observed effects following receptor antagonist treatment suggest that nicotinic receptors play a role in suppression of serum ghrelin levels,whereas nicotinic and muscarinic receptors both play a part in the increase of serum leptin levels.",

Additional mechanisms may include enhanced cholinergic neurotransmission as the α7 nicotinic receptor actions of choline and increased acetylcholine synthesis accompanying CDP-choline administration may modulate brain oscillations underlying cognitive processes. This study utilizes electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in healthy volunteers to evaluate CDP-choline induction of an oscillatory response profile associated with nicotinic stimulation. Resting state EEG was acquired in 24 male volunteers administered low (500mg) and moderate (1000mg) doses of CDP-choline in a randomized placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Consistent with nicotinic agonist treatment, spectral analysis showed dose-dependent reductions in delta and increases in alpha oscillations, which were also accompanied by decreases in beta and gamma oscillatory activity. These findings support the posit that CDP-choline cognitive enhancement involves multiple mechanisms including facilitated nicotinic cholinergic action.",

      "abstract": "Citicoline (CDP-choline; cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine) is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of cell membrane phospholipids. Citicoline serves as a choline donor in the biosynthetic pathways of acetylcholine and neuronal membrane phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine. The ability of citicoline to reverse neuronal injury has been tested in animal models of cerebral ischemia and clinical trials have been performed in stroke patients. However, no studies have examined the effect of citicoline on seizure-induced neuronal death. To clarify the potential therapeutic effects of citicoline on seizure-induced neuronal death, we used an animal model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was induced by intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine (25mg/kg) in adult male rats. Citicoline (100 or 300 mg/kg) was injected into the intraperitoneal space two hours after seizure onset and a second injection was performed 24h after the seizure. Citicoline was injected once per day for one week after pilocarpine- or kainate-induced seizure. Neuronal injury and microglial activation were evaluated at 1 week post-seizure. Surprisingly, rather than offering protection, citicoline treatment actually enhanced seizure-induced neuronal death and microglial activation in the hippocampus compared to vehicle treated controls. Citicoline administration after seizure-induction increased immunoglobulin leakage via BBB disruption in the hippocampus compared with the vehicle-only group. To clarify if this adverse effect of citicoline is generalizable across alternative seizure models, we induced seizure by kainate injection (10mg/kg, i.p.) and then injected citicoline as in pilocarpine-induced seizure. We found that citicoline did not modulate kainate seizure-induced neuronal death, BBB disruption or microglial activation. These results suggest that citicoline may not have neuroprotective effects after seizure and that clinical application of citicoline after seizure needs careful consideration.",

Choline is a selective α7 nAChR agonist and the aim of this study was to determine whether cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline), or citicoline, a dietary source of choline, increases sensory gating and cognition in healthy volunteers stratified for gating level. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design involving acute administration of low, moderate doses (500 mg, 1000 mg) of CDP-choline, 24 healthy volunteers were assessed for auditory gating as indexed by suppression of the P50 event-related potential (ERP) in a paired-stimulus (S1, S2) paradigm, and for executive function as measured by the Groton Maze Learning Task (GMLT) of the CogState Schizophrenia Battery. CDP-choline improved gating (1000 mg) and suppression of the S2 P50 response (500 mg, 1000 mg), with the effects being selective for individuals with low gating (suppression) levels. Tentative support was also shown for increased GMLT performance (500 mg) in low suppressors. These preliminary findings with CDP-choline in a healthy, schizophrenia-like surrogate sample are consistent with a α7 nAChR mechanism and support further trials with choline as a pro-cognitive strategy.",

      "abstract": "It has been shown that cholinergic system plays an important role in schizophrenia-associated cognitive deficits, therefore cholinergic drugs are novel targets for the treatment of cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia. We aimed to test the effects of CDP-choline on sensorimotor gating functioning, which is an important function for the integration of sensory and cognitive information processing and the execution of appropriate motor responses. In this study, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex was used to test the sensorimotor gating functioning, and the effects of CDP-choline on scopolamine induced PPI disruption were evaluated in rats. Furthermore, the contribution of the cholinergic mechanism in these effects was determined. CDP-choline (75, 250, 500mg/kg) by itself had no effect on the PPI in naïve animals. Scopolamine (0.4mg/kg; s.c.) significantly decreased the PPI levels and intraperitoneal administration of CDP-choline (250mg/kg) attenuated the effects of scopolamine. A non-specific nicotinic receptor antagonist, mecamylamine and an alpha 7 nicotinic receptor (α7-nAChR) antagonist, methyllycaconitine were used to investigate the mechanism underlying the effects of CDP-choline. Mecamylamine (3mg/kg; s.c.), and methyllycaconitine (10μg; i.c.v.) completely blocked the reversal effects of CDP-choline on scopolamine induced disruption of PPI. These results demonstrate that exogenous administration of CDP-choline attenuates scopolamine induced PPI disruption and show that the activation of central α7-nAChR may play a critical role in this effect.",

CDP-choline has been used for the treatment of cerebral ischaemia, showing beneficial effects. However, its potential benefit for the treatment of myocardial ischaemia has not been explored yet. AIM: In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the potential use of CDP-choline as a cardioprotector in an in vitro model of ischaemia/reperfusion injury. METHODS: Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were isolated and subjected to hypoxia/reperfusion using the coverslip hypoxia model. To evaluate the effect of CDP-choline on oxidative stress-induced reperfusion injury, the cells were incubated with H₂O₂ during reperfusion. The effect of CDP-choline pre- and postconditioning was evaluated using the cell viability MTT assay, and the proportion of apoptotic and necrotic cells was analyzed using the Annexin V determination by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Pre- and postconditioning with 50 mg/mL of CDP-choline induced a significant reduction of cells undergoing apoptosis after hypoxia/reperfusion. Preconditioning with CDP-choline attenuated postreperfusion cell death induced by oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: CDP-choline administration reduces cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress after hypoxia/reperfusion of cardiac myocytes. Thus, it has a potential as cardioprotector in ischaemia/reperfusion-injured cardiomyocytes.",

      "abstract": "CDP-choline has shown neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia. In humans, although a recent trial International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) has shown that global recovery is similar in CDP-choline and placebo groups, CDP-choline was shown to be more beneficial in some patients, such as those with moderate stroke severity and not treated with t-PA. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial actions of CDP-choline. We have now studied the participation of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in the neuroprotective actions of CDP-choline. Fischer rats and Sirt1⁻/⁻ mice were subjected to permanent focal ischemia. CDP-choline (0.2 or 2 g/kg), sirtinol (a SIRT1 inhibitor; 10 mg/kg), and resveratrol (a SIRT1 activator; 2.5 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally. Brains were removed 24 and 48 h after ischemia for western blot analysis and infarct volume determination. Treatment with CDP-choline increased SIRT1 protein levels in brain concomitantly to neuroprotection. Treatment with sirtinol blocked the reduction in infarct volume caused by CDP-choline, whereas resveratrol elicited a strong synergistic neuroprotective effect with CDP-choline. CDP-choline failed to reduce infarct volume in Sirt1⁻/⁻ mice. Our present results demonstrate a robust effect of CDP-choline like SIRT1 activator by up-regulating its expression. Our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies to activate SIRT1 may be useful in the treatment of stroke. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is implicated in a wide range of cellular functions. Regarding stroke, there is no direct evidence. We have demonstrated that citicoline increases SIRT1 protein levels in brain concomitantly to neuroprotection. Citicoline fails to reduce infarct volume in Sirt1⁻/⁻ mice. Our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies acting on SIRT1 may be useful in the treatment of stroke.",

Cytidine 5-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) has recently been reported to have neuroprotective effects in animal models for neurodegenerative diseases, attributable to its anti-glutamatergic, anti-excitotoxic, anti-apoptotic and membrane-preserving properties. In this study we administered either CDP-choline or vehicle to transgenic SOD1-G93A mice daily via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection starting before disease onset (day 30). By monitoring of survival, motor function, weight and general condition we examined possible therapeutic effects. Additional animals were used for histological studies to determine the effect of CDP-choline on motor neuron survival, astrocytosis and myelination in the spinal cord. Results showed that CDP-choline treatment modified neither the deterioration of general condition nor the loss of body weight. Survival of CDP-choline treated animals was not prolonged compared to vehicle treated controls. None of the behavioural motor function tests revealed differences between groups and no differences in motor neuron survival, astrocytosis or myelination were detected by histological analyses. In conclusion, our data from the transgenic mouse model do not strongly support further clinical validation of CDP-choline for the treatment of ALS.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible cytoprotective effect of CDP-choline treatment on intestinal cell damage, membrane phospholipid content, inflammation, and apoptosis in a neonatal rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). METHODS: We divided a total of 30 newborn pups into three groups: control, NEC, and NEC + CDP-choline. We induced NEC by enteral formula feeding, exposure to hypoxia-hyperoxia, and cold stress. We administered CDP-choline intraperitoneally at 300 mg/kg/d for 3 d starting from the first day of life. We evaluated apoptosis macroscopically and histopathologically in combination with proinflammatory cytokines in the gut samples. Moreover, we determined membrane phospholipid levels as well as activities of xanthine oxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and myeloperoxidase enzymes and the malondialdehyde content of intestinal tissue. RESULTS: Mean clinical sickness score, macroscopic gut assessment score, and intestinal injury score were significantly improved, whereas mean apoptosis score and caspase-3 levels were significantly reduced in pups in the NEC + CDP-choline group compared with the NEC group. Tissue proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) levels as well as tissue malondialdehyde content and myeloperoxidase activities were reduced, whereas glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities were preserved in the NEC + CDP-choline group. In addition, NEC damage reduced intestinal tissue membrane phospholipids, whereas CDP-choline significantly enhanced total phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine levels. Long-term follow-up in additional experiments revealed increased body weight, decreased clinical sickness scores, and enhanced survival in CDP-choline-receiving versus saline-receiving pups with NEC lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports, for the first time, beneficial effects of CDP-choline treatment on intestinal injury in a neonatal rat model of NEC. Our data suggest that CDP-choline may be used as an effective therapeutic agent to prevent NEC.",

During aging, enzyme activities vary in a complex way respect to the type of mitochondria, i.e. non-synaptic and intra-synaptic. This micro-heterogeneity is an important factor, because energy-related mitochondrial enzyme catalytic properties cause metabolic modifications of physiopathological significance in cerebral tissue in vivo, also discriminating pre- and post-synaptic sites of action for drugs and affecting tissue responsiveness to noxious stimuli. Results show that CDP-choline in vivo treatment enhances cerebral energy metabolism selectively at 18 months, specifically modifying enzyme catalytic activities in non-synaptic and intra-synaptic \"light\" mitochondrial sub-populations. This confirms that the observed changes in enzyme catalytic activities during aging reflect the bioenergetic state at each single age and the corresponding energy requirements, further proving that in vivo drug treatment is able to interfere with the neuronal energy metabolism.",

Fifteen rats were embolized in the right internal carotid artery with an autologous clot and were divided into three groups: (1) infarct; (2) intravenous rt-PA 5 mg/kg 30 minutes post-embolization; and (3) CDP-choline 1000 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, three doses, 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours post-embolization.

In this study, CDP-choline and rt-PA produced a significant reduction in brain damage considering infarct volume, cell death, and inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6) compared with the infarct group. Additionally, CDP-choline significantly decreased infarct volume, cell death, and IL-6 levels with respect to the rt-PA group. From these results, we conclude that high-dose CDP-choline may be an effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke even in absence of thrombolysis.",

The aims of this study were to test whether systemic treatment with CDP-choline was effective in improving the recovery of injured sciatic nerve, and to determine whether the cytidine and/or choline moieties of CDP-choline contribute to its beneficial actions. METHODS: Seventy Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a surgical procedure that involved transectioning and immediate surgical repairing of the right sciatic nerve. Rats were assigned to one of five groups and administered intraperitoneally 1 ml/kg of saline (control) or saline containing 600 μmol/kg of each of CDP-choline, cytidine, choline, or cytidine+choline. RESULTS: Recovery in sciatic function index score was greater in rats treated with CDP-choline, choline, or cytidine+choline at 8 and 12 weeks after the interventions. Peripheral nerve regeneration evaluated by electromyography at 12 weeks was also greater in rats receiving CDP-choline (228% of control), choline (168% of control), or cytidine+choline (221% of control). Axon counts and axon density increased significantly following CDP-choline, choline, or cytidine+choline, respectively. Treatment with equivalent dose of cytidine failed to affect sciatic function index, electromyography, and axon counts. Treatment with CDP-choline, but not its metabolites improved nerve adherence and separability score.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and treated or not with CDP-choline (500 mg/kg) daily for 14 days starting 30 min after pMCAO. Functional status was evaluated with Roger's test; lesion volume with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E); cell death with TUNEL; cellular proliferation with BrdU immunohistochemistry; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) by immunofluorescence and Western-blot techniques. CDP-choline significantly improved functional recovery and decreased lesion volume on MRI, TUNEL-positive cell number and LRP levels at 14 days. In addition, CDP-choline significantly increased BrdU, VEGF and synaptophysin values and decreased GFAP levels in the peri-infarct zone compared with the infarct group. In conclusion, our data indicate that CDP-choline improved functional recovery after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in association with reductions in lesion volume, cell death and LRP expression. In fact, CDP-choline increased cell proliferation, vasculogenesis and synaptophysin levels and reduced GFAP levels in the peri-infarct area of the ischemic stroke.",

The aims of this study were to test whether CDP-choline was effective at promoting nerve healing when the surgery to repair an injury was delayed and to determine whether the cytidine and/or the choline moieties of CDP-choline contribute to its beneficial actions. METHODS: One hundred and fifty Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a surgical procedure that involved damaging the right sciatic nerve and suturing the epineurium. The injured sciatic nerve was either repaired immediately (on the first day) or on the third day after surgery. Rats were assigned to one of five groups and received a topical application of either 0.4 ml of saline (control) or 0.4 ml of 100 μM CDP-choline, cytidine, choline, or cytidine+choline. RESULTS: The sciatic function index (SFI) of the rats in both groups (those who had their nerve repair immediately versus those on day 3) improved gradually by 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. The percentage recovery in SFI score was significantly higher in rats treated with CDP-choline or cytidine+choline at all time points. Axon count increased by ∼50% in rats treated either with CDP-choline or cytidine+choline. Treatment with CDP-choline or cytidine+choline reduced scar formation and decreased nerve adherence when the sciatic nerve was repaired immediately, and rats treated with CDP-choline or cytidine+choline had better axonal organization than control rats. Treatment with choline or cytidine alone led to a less marked improvement in SFI score and failed to increase axon count. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that CDP-choline, as well as the combination of its metabolites, cytidine+choline, improves the functional recovery and promotes the regeneration of injured sciatic nerves treated with immediate or delayed surgical repair in rats.",

As a result, many researchers have investigated the use of CDP-choline for various types of neurological insult or conditions, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer disease. Despite the fact that the safety of the compound has been verified across multiple international studies, evidence for efficacy remains less clear. This may be attributable, at least in part, to several issues, including a lack of randomized clinical trials, a lack of availability of the compound in the United States, and statistical power issues in reported trials. In addition, the fact that CDP-choline has multiple potential points of therapeutic impact makes it an exciting treatment option in theory but also complicates the analysis of efficacy in the sense that multiple mechanisms and time points must be evaluated. Although some clinical conditions do not appear to benefit from CDP-choline treatment, the majority of findings to date have suggested at least minor benefits of treatment. In this review we will examine the evidence in the published literature pertaining to use of CDP-choline in rehabilitation populations and briefly consider the work yet to be done.",

CDP-choline (citicoline) increases brain plasticity after experimental stroke. Therefore, we study if citicoline treatment could increase the EPC concentration after ischemic stroke. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with a first-ever non-lacunar ischemic stroke were consecutively included in the study within 12 hours of symptoms onset. Patients received treatment (n = 26) or non-treatment (n = 22) with oral citicoline (2000 mg/day) from acute phase of ischemic stroke and for 6 weeks. EPC colonies were quantified as early outgrowth colony forming unit-endothelial cell (CFU-EC) at admission (before citicoline treatment) and day 7. We defined the EPC increment during the first week as the difference in the numbers of CFU-EC between day 7 and admission. RESULTS: CFU-ECs were similar at baseline between patients treated and non-treated with citicoline (7.7±6.1 versus 9.1±7.3 CFU-EC, P = 0.819). However, patients treated with citicoline and recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) showed a higher EPC increment compared to patients treated only with citicoline or non-treated (35.4±15.9 versus 8.4 ± 8.1 versus 0.9 ± 10.2 CFU-EC, P < 0.0001). In a logistic model, citicoline treatment [odds ratio (OR), 17.6; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 2.3-137.5, P = 0.006] and co-treatment with citicoline and rt-PA (OR, 108.5; CI 95%, 2.9-1094.2, P = 0.001) were independently associated with an EPC increment⩾4 CFU-EC. CONCLUSION: The administration of citicoline and the co-administration of citicoline and rt-PA increase EPC concentration in acute ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The protective effect of CDP-choline in spinal cord transection and the mediation of its cardiovascular effects were investigated. METHODS: Spinal cords of rats were transected at the T1-T2 levels. CDP-choline (250 mg/kg; intravenous) was administered 2 h and/or 24 h after the injury. KEY FINDINGS: Spinal cord transection caused severe tissue damage, decreased mean arterial pressure, heart rate, plasma adrenaline, and noradrenaline but increased plasma vasopressin levels. Repeated CDP-choline treatment attenuated the degree of tissue injury. Administration of CDP-choline at 2 h after transection transiently increased blood pressure and decreased heart rate, while it produced a small decrease in blood pressure and heart rate when it was given at 24 h. Plasma adrenaline levels were higher in the group where CDP-choline was given repeatedly. Plasma noradrenaline and vasopressin levels did not change additionally after CDP-choline injections in all groups. In order to determine if CDP-choline attenuates the oxidative injury induced by transection, we measured blood superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase activity and malondialdehyde levels. Repeated CDP-choline administration decreased blood superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity without any effect on malondialdehyde levels. CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate that repeated intravenous CDP-choline treatment prevents tissue damage in spinal shock conditions in the acute phase. The cardiovascular effects of the drug do not seem to be responsible for this protection but the drug-induced attenuation of the oxidative stress may play a role.",

      "abstract": "A dysregulated host immune response, as opposed to the intrinsic virulence of a microbial pathogen induces a large part of the pathology seen in infectious diseases. However, current therapies are designed to target the pathogen rather than the underlying pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the manifestation of the pathology. Recent studies have highlighted the role of endothelial cell alteration in the pathology induced in sepsis and cerebral malaria. The endothelial onslaught described, is similar to that seen during ischemia reperfusion in stroke. Protecting endothelial cell membranes during sepsis and cerebral malaria, using citicoline in the same way as in stroke, has thus emerged as a new strategy that needs to be evaluated urgently. Citicoline is a natural compound that is registered for use in ischemic stroke, head trauma and neurological disorders. It enters the phosphatidylcholine synthesis pathway as a rate-limiting step and is involved in the modulation of a large number of metabolic pathways and neurotransmitter levels, and also in the biosynthesis of phospholipids in neuronal membranes. This short review highlights the potential role of citicoline as part of adjunct therapy in the treatment of infectious diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CDP-choline (citicholine; cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline) is an endogenously produced nucleotide which, when injected intracerebroventricularly, exerts an antinociceptive effect in acute pain models mediated by central cholinergic mechanisms and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7nAChR). Previous reports also suggest that the peripheral cholinergic system has an antiinflammatory role mediated by alpha7nAChRs on macrophages. METHODS: We used male Sprague-Dawley rats to assess the antihypersensitivity and antiinflammatory effect of CDP-choline after intraplantar injection of carrageenan (100 microL, 2%). Mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds and paw thickness were measured by Randall-Selitto testing and microcallipers, respectively. All drugs were administered intraplantarly in a volume 50 microL. RESULTS: CDP-choline (1, 2.5, 5 micromol; intraplantar) increased the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold and decreased paw edema in a dose- and time-dependent manner in the carrageenan-injected hindpaw. CDP-choline administration to the noninflamed contralateral hindpaw did not alter ipsilateral inflammation. Methyllycaconitine (100 nmol), a selective alpha7nAChR antagonist, completely blocked the effects of CDP-choline when administered to the inflamed hindpaw. However, the administration of methyllycaconitine to the contralateral hindpaw did not block the effects of CDP-choline in the ipsilateral paw. The administration of CDP-choline (5 micromol) 10 min after carrageenan administration to the ipsilateral hindpaw did not reduce swelling and edema but did significantly reduce hypersensitivity. Treatment with CDP-choline decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in the rat paw tissue after carrageenan. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that intraplantar CDP-choline has antihypersensitivity and antiinflammatory effects mediated via alpha7nAChRs in the carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain model.",

      "abstract": "We showed previously that choline administration protects dogs from endotoxin-induced multiple organ injury and platelet dysfunctions. Because sepsis/endotoxemia is associated with alterations in lipid metabolism, we have investigated whether choline or cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline, a choline donor, alters serum lipid responses to endotoxin in dogs and rats. In response to endotoxin, serum concentrations of triglycerides, choline-containing phospholipids, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in a dose- and time-related manner. Administration of choline (20 mg/kg i.v. in dogs or 90 mg/kg i.p. in rats) or cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline (70 mg/kg i.v. in dogs) 5 min before and 4 and 8 h after endotoxin blocked or attenuated the increases in serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids. Endotoxin-induced elevations in serum phospholipid levels did not change in rats and were enhanced in dogs by choline. In rats, serum lipid response to endotoxin was accompanied by severalfold elevations in serum levels of hepatorenal injury markers; their elevations were also blocked by choline. Pretreatment with hexamethonium blocked choline's effects on serum lipids and hepatorenal injury markers. Pretreatment with atropine blocked endotoxin-induced elevations in serum lipid and hepatorenal injury markers, but failed to alter choline's actions on these parameters. Choline treatment improved survival rate of rats in lethal endotoxin shock. In conclusion, these data show that choline treatment alters serum lipid responses to endotoxin and prevents hepatorenal injury during endotoxemia through a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated mechanism. Hence, choline and choline-containing compounds may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of endotoxemia/sepsis.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathy accompanied by abnormal sensory perception is the most common complication in insulin-dependent and -independent diabetes mellitus. Since there are very few effective therapeutic regimens for sensory abnormalities in diabetes, we examined the effect of cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP)-choline on the thermal nociceptive threshold in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice using the tail-flick test. Diabetic mice showed a shorter tail-flick latency at 1-4 weeks after streptozotocin treatment and a longer tail-flick latency after 8-12 weeks. This hyper- and hypoalgesia in diabetic mice was almost completely inhibited by daily treatment with CDP-choline (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) beginning on the day of streptozotocin treatment. Daily treatment with CDP-choline beginning 5 weeks after streptozotocin treatment attenuated the development of hypoalgesia. Diabetic mice showed a significant increase in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity at 3 weeks after streptozotocin treatment, whereas Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was decreased at 12 weeks after treatment. These alterations were normalized by daily treatment with CDP-choline (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) beginning the day of streptozotocin treatment. These results provide evidence to support the therapeutic potency of CDP-choline on the development of thermal hyper- and hypoalgesia and the progression of thermal hypoalgesia in diabetic mice. Moreover, these effects of CDP-choline may result from the normalization of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity.",

It demonstrates beneficial effects in certain central nervous system injury models, including cerebral ischaemia, neurodegenerative disorders and spinal cord injury. Defective neuronal and/or glial glutamate transport is claimed to contribute to progressive loss of motor neurons (MNs) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our previous ultrastructural studies, performed on an organotypic tissue culture model of chronic glutamate excitotoxicity, documented a subset of various modes of MN death including necrotic, apoptotic and autophagocytic cell injury. The aim of this ultrastructural study was to determine the potential neuroprotective effect of CDP-choline on neuronal changes in a glutamate excitotoxic ALS model in vitro. Organotypic cultures of the rat lumbar spinal cord subjected to 100 microM DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate (THA) were pretreated with 100 microM of CDP-choline. The exposure of spinal cord cultures to CDP-choline and THA distinctly reduced the development of typical apoptotic changes, whereas both necrotic and autophagocytic THA-induced MN injury occurred. These results indicate that CDP-choline treatment might exert a neuroprotective effect against neuronal apoptotic changes in a model of chronic excitotoxicity in vitro.",

Choline (3200 mum)-induced catecholamine secretion was attenuated by the presence of 1 mum of hexamethonium or mecamylamine, but not atropine, in the perfusion medium. 7 Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of choline (0.5-1.5 mumol) also increased plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline dose- and time-dependently. Pre-treatment with mecamylamine (50 mug; i.c.v.) or hexamethonium (15 mg/kg; i.p.), but not atropine (10 mug; i.c.v.), prevented i.c.v. choline (1.5 mumol)-induced elevations in plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline. 8 It is concluded that i.p. administration of CDP-choline or its cholinergic metabolites phosphocholine and choline increases plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations by enhancing nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission in the sympatho-adrenal system. Central choline also activates the sympatho-adrenal system by increasing central nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect on visual function of orally administered CDP-choline in addition to patching for the treatment of amblyopia in children. METHODS: This was an open label parallel group study comparing patching plus oral CDP-choline with patching alone. Sixty-one participants (aged between 5 and 10 years) suffering from anisometropic or strabismic amblyopia were divided at random into two groups: Group A, 800 or 1,200 mg (according to the body weight) of orally administered CDP-choline and 2-h patching a day; Group B, 2-h patching a day. Both groups were treated for 30 consecutive days. A follow-up visit was set 60 days after the treatment was discontinued. The main outcome measure was the change in visual acuity of amblyopic eyes as measured by Snellen's E charts. The secondary outcome measures were changes in the visual acuity of amblyopic eye as measured by isolated letters (Snellen's E) and changes in the contrast sensitivity of amblyopic eyes. RESULTS: The addition of CDP-choline to patching therapy was not found to be more effective than patching alone after 30-day treatment. The present results showed that adding CDP-choline to patching stabilised the effects obtained during the treatment period. In fact, whereas the participants treated only with patching showed a decrease in visual acuity at 90 days, these receiving CDP-choline and patching combined appeared to maintain the results obtained (two-way ANOVA: P = 0.0042). Similar results were obtained when measuring visual acuity by isolated Snellen's E letters. CONCLUSIONS: In amblyopic patients, CDP-choline combined with patching contributes to obtaining more stable effects than patching alone.",

      "abstract": "Chronic impairment of forelimb and digit movement is a common problem after stroke that is resistant to therapy. Although in the last years some studies have been performed to increase the efficacy of rehabilitative experience and training, the pharmacological approaches in this context remain poorly developed. We decided to study the effect of a chronic treatment with CDP-choline, a safe and well-tolerated drug that is known to stabilize membranes, on functional outcome and neuromorphological changes after stroke. To assess the functional recovery we have performed the staircase reaching test and the elevated body swing test (EBST), for studying sensorimotor integration and asymmetrical motor function respectively. The treatment with CDP-choline, initiated 24 h after the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and maintained during 28 days, improved the functional outcome in both the staircase test (MCAO+CDP=87.0+/-6.6% pellets eaten vs. MCAO+SAL=40.0+/-4.5%; p<0.05) and the EBST (MCAO+CDP=70.0+/-6.8% vs. MCAO+SAL=88.0+/-5.4%; contralateral swing p<0.05). In addition, to study potential neuronal substrates of the improved function, we examined the dendritic morphology of layer V pyramidal cells in the undamaged motor cortex using a Golgi-Cox procedure. The animals treated with CDP-choline showed enhanced dendritic complexity and spine density compared with saline group. Our results suggest that a chronic treatment with CDP-choline initiated 24 h after the insult is able to increase the neuronal plasticity within noninjured and functionally connected brain regions as well as to promote functional recovery.",

      "abstract": "Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) is a major membrane phospholipid, and its loss is sufficient in itself to induce cell death. PtdCho homeostasis is regulated by the balance between hydrolysis and synthesis. PtdCho is hydrolyzed by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), PtdChospecific phospholipase C (PtdCho-PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD). PtdCho synthesis is rate-limited by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), which makes CDP-choline. The final step of PtdCho synthesis is catalyzed by CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. PtdCho synthesis in the brain is predominantly through the CDP-choline pathway. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) significantly increased PLA2 activity, secretory PLA2 (sPLA2)-IIA mRNA and protein levels, PtdCho-PLC activity, and PLD2 protein expression following reperfusion. CDP-choline treatment significantly attenuated PLA2 activity, sPLA2-IIA mRNA and protein levels, and PtdCho-PLC activity, but did not affect PLD2 protein expression. tMCAO also resulted in loss of CCT activity and CCTalpha protein, which were partially restored by CDP-choline. No changes were observed in cytosolic PLA2 or calcium-independent PLA2 tMCAO. protein levels after Up-regulation of PLA2, PtdCho-PLC, and PLD and regulation of CCT collectively down-resulted in loss of PtdCho, which was significantly restored by CDP-choline treatment. CDP-choline treatment significantly attenuated the infarction volume by 55 +/- 5% after 1 h of tMCAO and 1 day of reperfusion. Taken together, these results suggest that CDP-choline significantly restores Ptd-Cho levels by differentially affecting sPLA2-IIA, PtdCho-PLC, and CCTalpha after transient focal cerebral ischemia. A hypothetical scheme is proposed integrating results from this study and from other reports in the literature.",

Saline (0.2 mL/kg), choline chloride (20 mg/kg), or CDP-choline (70 mg/kg) were given intravenously three times at 4-h intervals, and endotoxemia was induced by endotoxin (E. coli 055:B5, 20 microg/kg) infusion, 5 min after the first treatment. Blood samples were collected before and at multiple time points after the challenge, for a panel of hematologic parameters and platelet closure times measured by PFA-100. In saline-treated dogs, circulating platelet counts decreased by 85% (P < 0.001) at 0.5 h and remained low by 36%-80% (P < 0.5-0.001) 1-12 h after endotoxin. Circulating WBC counts decreased by 80%-90% (P < 0.001) at 0.5-2 h, and increased (P < 0.001) by 190% 12 h after the endotoxin. In response to endotoxin, RBCs increased by 10%-13% (P < 0.05) at 1-12 h. Endotoxin-induced decline in circulating platelets was attenuated at 0.5 h (P < 0.05-0.01) and reversed at 1-12 h (P < 0.05-0.001) by choline. Platelet closure times were shortened from 81 +/- 10 s and 135 +/- 10 s to 29 +/- 5 s (P < 0.001) and 60 +/- 3 s (P < 0.001) at 0.5 h, and prolonged (P < 0.001) at 1-8 h after endotoxin induction. Endotoxin-induced shortening in platelet closure times was attenuated (P < 0.05) and blocked (P < 0.01) by choline and CDP-choline, respectively.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CDP-choline (cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine) is a precursor essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, one of the cell membrane components that is degraded during cerebral ischaemia to free fatty acids and free radicals. Animal studies suggest that CDP-choline may protect cell membranes by accelerating resynthesis of phospholipids. CDP-choline may also attenuate the progression of ischaemic cell damage by suppressing the release of free fatty acids. CDP-choline is the endogenous compound normally produced by the organism. When the same substance is introduced as a drug it can be called citicoline.CDP-choline is mainly used in the treatment of disorders of a cerebrovascular nature. The many years of its presence in the clinical field have caused an evolution in dosage, method of administration, and selection criteria of patients to whom the treatments were given. Modalities of the clinical studies, including length of observation, severity of disturbance, and methodology of evaluation of the results were also heterogeneous. In spite of uncertainties about its efficacy due to these complexities, CDP-choline is a frequently prescribed drug for cognitive impairment in several European countries, especially when the clinical picture is predominantly one of cerebrovascular disease, hence the need for this review. Due to its effects on the adrenergic and dopaminergic activity of the CNS, CDP-choline has also been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of CDP-choline (cytidinediphosphocholine) in the treatment of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural deficits associated with chronic cerebral disorders in the elderly. SEARCH STRATEGY: The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 22 April 2004 using the terms CDP-choline, CDP, citicoline, cytidine diphosphate choline or diphosphocholine. The Register contains records from all major health-care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant unconfounded, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials of CDP-choline for cognitive impairment due to chronic cerebral disorders were considered for inclusion in the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently reviewed the included studies, extracted the data, and pooled it when appropriate and possible. The pooled odd ratios (95% Confidence Interval (CI)) or the average differences (95% CI) were estimated. No intention-to-treat data were available from the studies included. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Some of the included studies did not present numerical data suitable for analysis. Description of participants varied over the years and by type of disorders and severity, and ranged from aged individuals with subjective memory disorders to patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment (mild to moderate), Vascular Dementia or Senile Dementia (mild to moderate). Seven of the included studies observed the subjects for a period between 20 to 30 days, one study was of 6 weeks duration, four studies used periods extending over 2 and 3 months, one study observed continuous administration over 3 months and one study was prolonged, with 12 months of observation. The studies were heterogeneous in dose, modalities of administration, inclusion criteria for subjects, and outcome measures. Results were reported for the domains of attention, memory testing, behavioural rating scales, global clinical impression and tolerability. There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of CDP-choline on attention. There was evidence of benefit of CDP-choline on memory function and behaviour. The drug was well tolerated. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was some evidence that CDP-choline has a positive effect on memory and behaviour in at least the short to medium term. The evidence of benefit from global impression was stronger, but is still limited by the duration of the studies. Further research with CDP-choline should focus on longer term studies in subjects who have been diagnosed with currently accepted standardised criteria, especially Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment (VaMCI) or vascular dementia.",

      "abstract": "Brain phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels are regulated by a balance between synthesis and hydrolysis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1alpha/beta) activate phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and PC-phospholipase C (PC-PLC) to hydrolyze PC. PC hydrolysis by PLA(2) releases free fatty acids including arachidonic acid, and lyso-PC, an inhibitor of CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT). Arachidonic acid metabolism by cyclooxygenases/lipoxygenases is a significant source of reactive oxygen species. CDP-choline might increase the PC levels by attenuating PLA(2) stimulation and loss of CCT activity. TNF-alpha also stimulates proteolysis of CCT. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are induced in brain ischemia and may disrupt PC homeostasis by increasing its hydrolysis (increase PLA(2) and PC-PLC activities) and inhibiting its synthesis (decrease CCT activity). The beneficial effects of CDP-choline may result by counteracting TNF-alpha and/or IL-1 mediated events, integrating cytokine biology and lipid metabolism. Re-evaluation of CDP-choline phase III stroke clinical trial data is encouraging and future trails are warranted. CDP-choline is non-xenobiotic, safe, well tolerated, and can be considered as one of the agents in multi-drug treatment of stroke.",

In contrast, in humans oral CDP-choline increases plasma levels of uridine. To determine whether uridine can also enhance PC synthesis, we developed an assay for CDP-choline, an immediate and rate-limiting precursor in PC synthesis, and measured this intermediate in clonal PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells incubated with various concentrations of uridine or cytidine. Addition of uridine (50-100 microM) to the incubation medium caused significant elevations in UTP, CT, USAP and CDP-choline levels in PC12 cells. Uridine had no effect on the synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG) or the activity of the phosphotransferase which catalyzes the synthesis of PC from DAG and CDP-choline. Hence uridine treatment was unlikely to inhibit the conversion of endogenous CDP-choline to PC. These results suggest the possibility that uridine may also enhance PC synthesis in intact brain.",

OBJECTIVES: The objective is to assess the efficacy of CDP-choline (cytidinediphosphocholine) in the treatment of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural deficits associated with chronic cerebral disorders of older people.

The evidence of benefit from global impression is stronger, but is still limited by the duration of the studies.

      "abstract": "Twelve mildly hypertensive but otherwise normal fasting subjects received each of four treatments in random order: CDP-choline (citicoline; 500, 2000, and 4000 mg) or a placebo orally at 8:00 a.m. on four different treatment days. Eleven plasma samples from each subject, obtained just prior to treatment (8:00 a.m.) and 1-12 hr thereafter, were assayed for choline, cytidine, and uridine. Fasting terminated at noon with consumption of a light lunch that contained about 100 mg choline. Plasma choline exhibited dose-related increases in peak values and areas under the curves (AUCs), remaining significantly elevated, after each of the three doses, for 5, 8, and 10 hr, respectively. Plasma uridine was elevated significantly for 5-6 hr after all three doses, increasing by as much as 70-90% after the 500 mg dose, and by 100-120% after the 2000 mg dose. No further increase was noted when the dose was raised from 2000 to 4000 mg. Plasma cytidine was not reliably detectable, since it was less than twice blank, or less than 100 nM, at all of the doses. Uridine is known to enter the brain and to be converted to UTP; moreover, we found that uridine was converted directly to CTP in neuron-derived PC-12 cells. Hence, it seems likely that the circulating substrates through which oral citicoline increases membrane phosphatide synthesis in the brains of humans involve uridine and choline, and not cytidine and choline as in rats.",

      "abstract": "CDP-choline is a rate-limiting intermediate in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), an important component of the neural cell membrane. The ability of CDP-choline to alter phospholipid metabolism is an important function in the treatment of ischemic injury. Exogenous treatment with CDP-choline stimulates PtdCho synthesis and prevents release of free fatty acids (FFA), especially arachidonic acid (AA), after ischemia/reperfusion. Phase III clinical trials of CDP-choline in the treatment of stroke are currently underway. Here we report the neuroprotection by CDP-choline in transient forebrain ischemia of gerbils. CDP-choline significantly attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction after ischemia with 6-hr reperfusion, and considerably reduced the increase of AA in FFA and leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) synthesis at 1 day. Edema was significantly elevated after 1 and 2 days, but attained maximum at 3-day reperfusion. CDP-choline substantially attenuated edema at 3 days. Ischemia resulted in 80 +/- 8% CA(1) hippocampal neuronal death after 6-day reperfusion, and CDP-choline provided 65 +/- 6% neuroprotection. CDP-choline may act by increasing PtdCho synthesis via two pathways: (1) conversion of 1, 2-diacylglycerol to PtdCho, and (2) biosynthesis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, thus stabilizing the membrane and reducing AA release and metabolism to leukotriene C(4). This would result in decreased toxicity due to AA, leukotrienes, oxygen radicals, lipid peroxidation, and altered glutamate uptake, thus limiting BBB dysfunction, edema and providing neuroprotection.",

In addition, measures of drug craving and mood states after presentation of cocaine-related cues were collected on two occasions: before and after 14 days of double-blind treatment with either citicoline or placebo. Subjects did not experience any side effects and citicoline treatment was associated with decreases in self-reported mood states associated with cocaine craving. These preliminary data are encouraging and suggest that citicoline warrants further study as a promising potential treatment for cocaine abuse and dependence that is devoid of side effects.",

PAF levels in the striatum of aged (19 months) rats were 67% lower than those found in young (2 months) animals. Chronic treatment of aged rats with CDP-choline (500 mg/kg per day) reduced these PAF levels by more than 65% with respect to those of untreated aged rats after 8 days of treatment. PAF subsequently stabilized at these low levels as treatment continued. These results suggest that some effects of CDP-choline could be mediated by changes in brain PAF levels.",

      "abstract": "The exogenous administration of cytidine-5'-diphosphate (CDP)-choline has been used extensively as a brain activator in different neurological disorders that are associated with memory deficits. A total of 50 rats were utilized to (a) determine whether exogenously administered CDP-choline could attenuate posttraumatic motor and spatial memory performance deficits and (b) determine whether intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of CDP-choline increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in the dorsal hippocampus and neocortex. In the behavioral study, traumatic brain injury (TBI) was produced by lateral controlled cortical impact (2-mm deformation/6 m/sec) and administered CDP-choline (100 mg/kg) or saline daily for 18 days beginning 1 day postinjury. At 1 day postinjury, rats treated with CDP-choline 15 min prior to assessment performed significantly better than saline-treated rats. Between 14-18 days postinjury, CDP-choline-treated rats had significantly less cognitive (Morris water maze performance) deficits that injured saline-treated rats. CDP-choline treatment also attenuated the TBI-induced increased sensitivity to the memory-disrupting effects of scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist. The microdialysis studies demonstrated for the first time that a single i.p. administration of CDP-choline can significantly increase extracellular levels of ACh in dorsal hippocampus and neocortex in normal, awake, freely moving rats. This article provides additional evidence that spatial memory performance deficits are, at least partially, associated with deficits in central cholinergic neurotransmission and that treatments that enhance ACh release in the chronic phase after TBI may attenuate cholinergic-dependent neurobehavioral deficits.",

Evidence from both animal and in vitro studies indicates that cytidine 5' diphosphate choline (CDP-choline) can increase the synthesis of PtdCho; however, the effect of CDP-choline on brain choline metabolism has not previously been studied in human subjects. In this study, in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was used to measure brain levels of cytosolic, choline-containing compounds before and after single oral doses of CDP-choline. Three hours after dosing, plasma choline increased similarly in younger (mean age 25 years) and older subjects (mean age 59 years). However, while the choline resonance in brain increased by 18% on average in younger subjects, it decreased by almost 6% in older subjects (P = 0.028). These results may be explained by a previously observed decrease in brain choline uptake, but not cytidine uptake, in older subjects. Additional intracellular cytidine following the administration of CDP-choline should lead to the increased incorporation of choline already present in brain into membrane PtdCho, which is not MRS-visible, consequently lowering the brain choline resonance below that of pre-treatment values. These results suggest that the cytidine moiety of CDP-choline stimulates phosphatidylcholine synthesis in human brain cell membranes in older subjects.",

Animals were treated with CDP-choline from 12 months of age until 26 months. They were studied for both morphologic and morphometric features. The results obtained were compared to those of an age-matched control group. There was evidence of differences between NSNs of the control group and those of the CDP-choline group which showed neuronal hypertrophy. This size increase was mainly attributed to the increment of cellular protein synthesis machinery, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi complexes. Furthermore there was an increase in the number of neurosecretory granules (NSGs) in the CDP-choline group. In addition, there was no tertiary lysosomes in the treated animals. Moreover, the percentage of NSN membrane that was not covered by glial prolongations, increased from about 2% in the control group to 12% in the CDP-Choline treated group. These changes suggested an activation of the cellular processes for neurohormone synthesis in the experimental group. Furthermore, these NSNs displayed lipid droplets in their cytoplasm. The possible relationship between CDP-choline and NSNs activity is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine, CDP-choline or citicoline, is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of the structural phospholipids of cell membranes, especially in that of phosphatidylcholine. Upon oral or parenteral administration, CDP-choline releases its two principle components, cytidine and choline. When administered orally, it is absorbed almost completely, and its bioavailability is approximately the same as when administered intravenously. Once absorbed, the cytidine and choline disperse widely throughout the organism, cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the central nervous system (CNS), where they are incorporated into the phospholipid fraction of the membrane and microsomes. CDP-choline activates the biosynthesis of structural phospholipids in the neuronal membranes, increases cerebral metabolism and acts on the levels of various neurotransmitters. Thus, it has been experimentally proven that CDP-choline increases noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the CNS. Due to these pharmacological activities, CDP-choline has a neuroprotective effect in situations of hypoxia and ischemia, as well as improved learning and memory performance in animal models of brain aging. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CDP-choline restores the activity of mitochondrial ATPase and of membranal Na+/K+ ATPase, inhibits the activation of phospholipase A2 and accelerates the reabsorption of cerebral edema in various experimental models. CDP-choline is a safe drug, as toxicological tests have shown; it has no serious effects on the cholinergic system and it is perfectly tolerated. These pharmacological characteristics, combined with CDP-choline's mechanisms of action, suggest that this drug may be suitable for the treatment of cerebral vascular disease, head trauma of varying severity and cognitive disorders of diverse etiology. In studies carried out on the treatment of patients with head trauma, CDP-choline accelerated the recovery from post-traumatic coma and the recuperation of walking ability, achieved a better final functional result and reduced the hospital stay of these patients, in addition to improving the cognitive and memory disturbances which are observed after a head trauma of lesser severity and which constitute the disorder known as postconcussion syndrome. In the treatment of patients with acute cerebral vascular disease of the ischemic type, CDP-choline accelerated the recovery of consciousness and motor deficit, attaining a better final result and facilitating the rehabilitation of these patients. The other important use for CDP-choline is in the treatment of senile cognitive impairment, which is secondary to degenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and to chronic cerebral vascular disease. In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, CDP-choline improves scores on cognitive evaluation scales, while in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type, it slows the disease's evolution. Beneficial neuroendocrine, neuroimmunomodulatory and neurophysiological effects have been described. CDP-choline has also been shown to be effective as co-therapy for Parkinson's disease. No serious side effects have been found in any of the groups of patients treated with CDP-choline, which demonstrates the safety of the treatment.",

In patients with chronic cerebrovascular disorders, CDP-choline reduces the slow delta frequencies and increases alpha activity in spectral electroencephalogram analysis. We have studied the effect of CDP-choline (cytidine-S-diphosphate-choline; 1000 mg/day x 30 days, p.o.) on brain electrical activity mapping and mental performance in 19 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (10 males/9 females; age: 66.21 +/- 1.48 years; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): 26.55 +/- 1.22, Spanish version max. score 35). EEG was registered from 19 electrodes placed according to the 10-20 system and digitalized online. Artefact-free 2-s periods were visually selected, submitted to a frequency analysis and averaged across periods. CDP-choline significantly decreased spectral amplitude in the theta band in F4, F8, and T4 electrodes, and did not modify relative power parameters in any of the frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta) as compared to basal recordings. In patients with late-onset AD (LOAD; N = 6; age: 73.5 +/- 1.34 years; MMSE: 28.75 +/- 2.33), CDP-choline tended to increase relative alpha power in O1 and O2 electrodes. No changes were found in early-onset AD patients (EOAD; N = 13; age: 62.85 +/- 1.21 years; MMSE: 25.54 +/- 1.4). We detected a significant improvement in mental performance after 1 month of treatment with CDP-choline in patients with early-onset AD in whom brain electrical activity data correlated with cognitive parameters. It is likely that the bioelectrical changes induced by CDP-choline in AD are the result of its immunogenic and/or neurotrophic activity in the vicinity of the vascular microenvironment.",

A hyperactivation in the histaminergic system has been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including increased levels of HA in brain, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. In addition, changes in phospholipid metabolism and neuroimmune function have been reported in AD. CDP-choline (cytidine-5-diphosphate-choline) participates in the phospholipid metabolism pathway incorporating free choline into phosphatidyl-choline and choline plasmalogens in several tissues, including the central nervous system. In this study we have measured the concentration of HA in blood from patients with early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) under treatment with CDP-choline (1000 mg p.o. x30 days). HA was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection. CDP-choline reduced the basal levels of blood HA in both EOAD and LOAD by 2-fold. The reduction in blood HA content was observed 2 h after CDP-choline administration and gradually progressed for 30 days of treatment. These results confirm the potential immunogenic effects of CDP-choline and also that an excess of HA might influence some etiopathogenic events in AD.",

Furthermore, several authors have demonstrated the positive effects of CDP-choline on cognitive disorders and memory deficits. In the present study, the effects of CDP-choline (1000 mg/day, p.o. for 1 month) on cognition, evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of Folstein et al., and on blood flow velocities, measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD), were investigated in patients with Alzheimer's disease: (AD, n = 20, age: 66.75 +/- 6.73 years, range: 57-78 yr). Cognitive function was measured by means of the MMSE in basal conditions (A) and after 1 month of treatment with CDP-choline (C). TCD measures were taken through the temporal window for right (MCA-R) and left (MCA-L) middle cerebral arteries with a 2 MHz pulsed transducer using a TC-2000S in basal conditions (A), 1 h after the administration of CDP-choline (B) and after 1 month of treatment with CDP-choline (C). MMSE scores were significantly increased (p < 0.005) in patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) after CDP-choline treatment. Moreover, the orientation subtest significantly increased in the global group of AD patients (p < 0.01) and in EOAD patients (p < 0.02). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were also found in MCA-Land MCA-R measures between recordings. These results suggest that CDP-choline influences cognitive and cerebrovascular function in Alzheimer's disease, probably through a mechanism linked to an immunogenic and/or neurotrophic effect at the microvascular niche.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The presence of abnormal epitopes exposed on neuronal membranes may contribute to the activation of resting microglia initiating a neuroimmune cascade leading to cell destruction. According to this hypothesis, a multifactorial treatment in AD should produce: 1) inhibition of beta-amyloid and NFT formation; 2) restoration of neuronal membrane integrity; and 3) control of neuroimmune auto-aggression. Since interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an APP gene promoter showing a progressive increase in body fluids in parallel with mental deterioration in AD patients, we have studied the effects of CDP-choline on cognition, several biological parameters, and IL-1 beta production in AD and multi-infarct dementia (MID) in order to elucidate whether this compound alone or in combination with other drugs is able to restore immune function and improve mental performance in senile dementia.",

Some proteins, identified by immunoblotting assay as various subunits of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and calmodulin, were particularly impaired. Chronic treatment with CDP-choline at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight per day for 28 days caused significant changes in the amounts of several of the above mentioned proteins. Most of the proteins, which decreased during aging, showed a significant increase after CDP-choline treatment compared with the corresponding control values at the same age. The effect of CDP-choline might be due to: the increased availability of cytidylic nucleotides, which in the brain are present in limited amounts compared to the other nucleotides; the increased content of total adenine nucleotides; the improvement of brain energy metabolism.",

      "abstract": "1. Spiroperidol binding (dopamine D2 receptors) and quinuclidinyl benzilate binding (muscarinic receptors) in striata of 19-month old mice was analyzed for animals that had received chronic administration of cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) incorporated into the chow consumed (100 or 500 mg kg-1 added per day) for the 7 months before they were killed. 2. Treated animals displayed an increase in the dopamine receptor densities of 11% for those receiving 100 mg kg-1 and 18% for those receiving 500 mg kg-1 as compared to the control aged animals that had received no CDP-choline. Control animals showed, from 2 months to 19 months of life, a 28% decrease in the receptor density. No change in the affinity of the receptors for spiroperidol was found in the treated or untreated animals. 3. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor densities were also partially recovered by the same treatment in aged animals that showed a 14% decrease of these receptors in this case. The muscarinic receptor density increased 6% for the animals that received 100 mg kg-1 and 17% for the animals that received 500 mg kg-1 without any change in the affinity of the receptor for quinuclidinyl benzilate. 4. Aged animals displayed a slight increase in brain membrane fluidity as indicated by a decrease in the polarization value of the non-polar fluorophore 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Interestingly, in the treated animals a greater increase in membrane fluidity was determined and found to be very similar for the two doses.5. It is concluded that chronic administration of CDP-choline to aged animals promoted a partial recovery of the striatum dopamine and acetylcholine receptor function normally reduced with aging, which might be explicable in terms of mechanisms involving fluidity of the brain neuronal membrane.",

Fourteen young men admitted to the neurosurgery service after sustaining mild to moderate CHI were randomized to oral CDP-choline (1 g) and placebo control groups which were matched for age, education and severity of impaired consciousness. Baseline (prior to discharge) and one month examinations consisted of a structured postconcussional symptom interview and neuropsychological tests. Results (Wilcoxon test) showed that CDP-choline produced a greater reduction of postconcussional symptoms than placebo (P less than 0.005). Analysis of the neuropsychological findings revealed a significantly greater improvement in recognition memory for designs in the CDP-choline treated patients (P less than 0.02) whereas other changes in test performance did not differ for the two groups. Pending replication in a larger series of patients, our findings suggest that CDP-choline may be effective in treating sequelae of mild to moderate CHI.",

The study was performed on 237 fully evaluable patients with the use of the reduced geriatric scale of Plutchik and al., for clinical evaluation of the symptomatology. The clinical data obtained demonstrate that treatment with CDP-choline is able to determine an improvement of symptomatology since the 1st cycle of therapy (p less than 0.001), and a further improvement in the 2nd cycle (p less than 0.001). Particularly, the therapeutic effect of the 1st cycle is persistent in the intermediate wash-out period (suspension of treatment) with a further decrease, of symptomatology regarding some items of Plutchik's scale (p less than 0.01). Finally, treatment with CDP-choline 1000 mg/die for two 21-day cycles in 237 patients suffering from brain aging determined a statistically significant improvement of the cognitive and behavioural parameters taken into consideration: independence/autonomous life; human relations/social life; interest and attentive capacity; individual behaviour. Therefore citicoline is confirmed as a valid therapeutic remedy for the clinical, functional and social recovery of these patients.",

The protection obtained with CDP-choline was analyzed by a morphometric analysis and showed that pretreatment of neuronal cultures with CDP-choline maintained the number of cell aggregates and of primary neuronal processes at control values after hypocapnic shock. Various experiments showed that the intact molecule was responsible for the protective action, since pretreatment with different concentrations of various nucleosides and nucleotides (up to 10(-5) M), choline, and phosphorylcholine was without protective effect. The addition of CDP-choline after the hypocapnic injury resulted in a protection of the cultures as shown by morphological observation. Incubation of neurons with radioactive choline showed that hypocapnia increased the incorporation of the label into phospholipids whereas the presence of CDP-choline reduced it. The de novo synthesis of choline was affected by neither hypocapnia nor CDP-choline treatment. The results indicate that CDP-choline may have the capacity to protect neurons under conditions of basic pH and that cellular proliferation may be stimulated by the compound.",

The antiaggregatory activity of aortic walls was also concomitantly reduced. After chronic treatment, the major effect was a greater antiaggregatory activity of the vessel wall in respect of the control values, whereas platelet function was not affected.

      "abstract": "Various anomalies of pulmonary surfactant have been described in relation to acute respiratory distress syndromes, hypersensitivity lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the essential phospholipid component of pulmonary surfactant. Cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) is an essential intermediary in the biosynthesis of PC. The authors studied two groups of patients: one group consisted of diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and the other consisted of pulmonary sarcoidosis with parenchymal involvement. They observed quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of the phospholipid fractions of surfactant and more particularly of PC. The finding of a marked decrease in this phospholipid, especially in the cases of pulmonary fibrosis, justified the study of the therapeutic effects of CDP-choline. After one month of treatment with this substance, at a dose of 1 g I.M. per day, the PC fraction had returned to normal and, at the same time, there was an improvement in the PaO2 at rest and after exercise. Long term administration of CDP-choline appears to be valuable in the maintenance of the phospholipid equilibrium of pulmonary surfactant and in the improvement of the quality of alveolar gas exchange.",

      "abstract": "Lipid synthesis has been tested in vivo in different brain areas of 12-month-old male rats. Cortex, striatum, brainstem, and subcortex of brain have been examined. The cerebellum was discarded. Mixtures of (2-3H)glycerol and (Me-14C)choline were injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain as lipid precursors, and their incorporation into total lipid, water-soluble intermediates and choline-containing phospholipids was examined 1 hr after isotope injection. In another series of experiments cytidine-5'-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline) was injected intraventricularly to the aged rats 10 min before sacrifice with a simultaneous injection, and radioactivity assays were performed as above. Distribution of radioactivity content of CDP-choline among brain areas 10 min after its administration showed a noticeable enrichment of the nucleotide and water-soluble-related compounds in the examined areas, but to a lesser degree in the cerebral cortex. The incorporation of labelled glycerol, which is severely depressed in aged rats in all four areas [Gaiti et al, 1982, 1983], was increased only in the cortex, and apparently decreased in the other areas. This last result is probably due to a dilution effect brought about by the administered cold CDP-choline upon the (14C)-containing water-soluble metabolites. As a consequence, the (3H)/(14C) ratio in total lipid and in isolated phosphatidylcholine and choline plasmalogen increased after CDP-choline treatment.",

They were suffering from several neurological processes, mainly the vasculocerebral insufficiency and senile involution. Treatment was carried out for between 15 days and 2 months, the mean dose being 6 ml/d. The efficacy of the treatment was determined on the basis of the disappearance, improvement or worsening of clinical manifestations, most frequently shown by patients. The most benefited clinical manifestations by the treatment were: dizziness disappearing in 48.4% of the cases, and improving in 25.2%, cephalea disappearing in 46.5% and improving in 26.7%, insomnia with 38.6% and 24.9%, respectively; depression with 36.9% and 24.1% and memory shortage with 21.2% and 44.7% respectively. The best results were obtained in chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency, the improvements obtained in dizziness, cephalea, insomnia, fatigue and speech troubles being the most important. The safety of the drug was excellent since side effects were observed only in 5.01% of the patients. Among these effects, the most frequently seen were digestive troubles, observed in 3.6% of the cases.",

CDP-Choline-treated cats exhibited a statistically significant increase in resistance to the effects of mechanical compression of the brain when compared with the vehicle-treated group.

CDP-Choline also imparted protection against the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of brain compression; animals were apparently less susceptible to cardiac and respiratory failure under the influence of the test compound. A statistically significant protection against the lethal effects of epidural compression was also noted in CDP-choline treated cats.

Clinical evaluations were carried out using the Webster Rating Scale (WRS), the Northwestern University Disability Scale (NUDS) and a semiquantitative rating scale for tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. CDP-choline treatment showed a significant improvement of rigidity and bradykinesia and a less important amelioration of tremor. NUDS and WRS showed a similar positive result. Comparing the results obtained by placebo, we found that the actual clinical efficacy of CDP-choline regards mainly bradykinesia and rigidity (23 and 33% improvement, respectively). The positive effect of CDP-choline on parkinsonian patients already treated with L-dopa + dopa decarboxylase inhibitor stands for a possible action on the DA receptor through an activation of the phospholipid metabolism.",

Definite changes in the energy status of brain demonstrated that carotid occlusion was effective. Five minutes before ligation, an intraventricular injection of either saline or cytidine disphosphate choline (CDP-choline, 0.6 micromol/brain, 3 microliter) was given to groups of animals. Control animals, with and without CDP-choline, together with the ischemic groups, were decapitated directly into liquid nitrogen; 10 min after arterial ligation. Brain free fatty acids, neutral lipids and phospholipids, which were labeled in vivo by the intraventricular injection of [1-14C]arachidonic acid (0.4-0.6 micro Ci, 6-9 nmol) 2 hr prior to ligation, were extracted, purified, and separated by thin-layer chromatographic procedures. The CDP-choline treatment noticeably corrected the increase of total and individual fatty acids due to ischemia and the increase of their radioactivity content. The changes in neutral lipids, particularly in the diacyl glycerol fraction, were also corrected by the injection of the nucleotide. CDP-choline partially reversed the decreased of brain phosphatidylcholine and of its labeling, which was due to ischemia. All the data indicate that the prior injection of CDP-choline stimulates the choline phosphotransferase reaction of brain towards synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and prevents the release of free fatty acids, particularly of arachidonic acid, associated with ischemia.",

The labeling of macromolecules extracted from the various subcellular fractions of these brain regions was also determined. Hypoxic treatment affected macromolecular labeling to a different extent in the three brain regions examined. CDP-choline treatment was not able to reverse the effect of hypoxia on DNA labeling, but it was able to remove the effect of hypoxia on RNA and protein labeling. The action of CDP-choline was particularly evident on the labeling of RNA in nuclei and mitochondria of the cerebellum and on the labeling of proteins in microsomes of the three brain regions examined.",

      "abstract": "1. Administration of estradiol-17 beta to pregnant rabbits at 25 days gestation (term, 31 days) resulted n a significant increase in the incorporation of [14C]-choline, but not [14C]ethanolamine, into the lipids of fetal lung slices. The incorporation of [35S]methionine was not affected. 2. Enzymatic assays conducted in vitro revealed no significant effect on either the activities of several enzyme markers for subcellular organelles, the activities of the enzymes responsible for the production of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol, membrane-bound or aqueously dispersed phosphatidate-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activities or the activities of the auxiliary enzymes responsible for the synthesis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. 3. The activity of the enzymes involved in the choline pathway for the de novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine were not significantly altered except for a 66% increase in the CTP:cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase activity assayed in the cytosol. The addition of phosphatidylglycerol stimulated cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase activity approx. 3-fold. However, in the presence of this lipid, the activities in cytosol from control and treated fetuses were similar, indicating that the increased activity noted in the absence of phosphatidylglycerol was due to an activation of existing cytidylyltransferase activity rather than an increase in total enzyme units. 4. Estrogen treatment of the does was also associated with a marked decrease in the levels of cholinephosphate in fetal lung and significant increases in the levels of CDPcholine and phosphatidylcholine. These alterations in pool size are consistent with an increase in the activity of cholinephosphate cytidyltransferase in vivo. The results suggest that cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase may catalyse an important rate-determining reaction in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in fetal lung. The data also support the view that the reaction catalysed by CDPcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase also has a regulatory role during development.",

      "abstract": "To further assess the effects of CDP (cytidine diphosphate)-choline on Parkinsonian symptoms, striatal dopamine (DA) was measured fluorometrically in rats after injection of CDP-choline. CDP-choline (300 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the DA content in the striatum (p less than 0.05) one hour after injection. The behavioral effect of CDP-choline was then tested in rats in which the unilateral nigro-striatal DA neurons had degenerated following an intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). CDP-choline alone did not produce behavioral changes in these rats. However, pretreatment with a single dose of CDP-choline (900 mg/kg, i.p.) suppressed both the apomorphine-induced contralateral and the d-amphetamine-induced ipsilateral circling. The same dose of CDP-choline suppressed the number of treadmill revolutions in mice. On the other hand, a 7-day consecutive treatment with 300 mg/kg of CDP-choline enhanced the apomorphine-induced contralateral circling (by 42%, p less than 0.05). The same treatment with CDP-choline raised the striatal DA content by 29% (p less than 0.05) on the intact side, but not on the 6-OHDA injected side. These results indicate that CDP-choline has either a direct nor an indirect DA agonistic effect. The increase in DA content, decrease in locomotion and enhancement of the effect of apomorphine can be explained on the hypothesis that CDP-choline may act as an antagonist on the DA neurons and receptors. The validity of this apparently paradoxical use of CDP-choline with antagonistic effect on DA neurons in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is discussed.",

After CDP-choline treatment, an increase of the specific radioactivity of total lipids and of phospholipids was observed in mitochondria purified from the three above-mentioned brain regions of the hypoxic animals, while no effect on the other subcellular fractions was found. CDP-Choline had a stimulating effect particularly on the incorporation of both precursors into mitochondrial PC, PE, and polyglycerophosphatides isolated form the three brain regions examined. The results obtained show that the action of CDP-choline in restoring lipid metabolism was more pronounced in brain mitochondria, which, among subcellular fractions, were the most affected by the hypoxic treatment.",
