      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis is a progressive joint disease that affects one or more joints, leading to restricted movement, pain, and eventual disability. Despite the availability of various treatments and supportive care, managing osteoarthritis symptoms remains challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Hydroalcoholic olive leaf extract on pain reduction and daily functioning in elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis. METHOD: A randomized, controlled, factorial clinical trial was conducted in 2022-2023 with 100 elderly participants suffering from knee osteoarthritis. Participants were selected through consecutive sampling and randomly assigned to four groups using block-stratified randomization. In addition to routine treatment, participants in group I received topical olive leaf extract ointment, Group II received oral olive leaf extract capsules, and Group III received a combination of both treatments. The intervention was administered three times daily for eight weeks. The control group did not receive any olive leaf extract-based interventions. Pain intensity was assessed using a visual analog scale, and daily functioning and joint stiffness were measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The intervention groups showed significantly more significant reductions in mean pain scores than the control group (p < 0.05). The combination of oral capsules and topical ointment among the intervention groups demonstrated the most pronounced pain reduction. The mean score for daily functioning improved significantly over time in all groups (p = 0.007). A decrease of 1.19 units per time increment was observed in the group using the ointment, while the oral capsule group showed a decrease of 0.89 units, both statistically significant (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Hydroalcoholic olive leaf extract effectively reduces pain and improves physical functioning in elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis, offering a promising complementary treatment option for managing osteoarthritis symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maintaining optimum glycaemic control is essential to reducing comorbidity and mortality in diabetes. However, research indicates that <50 % of patients achieve their target HbA1c ranges. Laboratory studies suggest that olive leaf extract (OLE) may improve glycaemic control, however clinical studies in persons with diabetes are lacking. METHODS: ESOLED is a pilot, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Adults with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes of ≥12 months duration, and not receiving insulin therapy, were eligible to participate. Participants were randomised to receive OLE or placebo capsules for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included changes in the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, diabetes-related stress, health-related quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: Thirty-one participants were randomly assigned to the OLE (n = 16) and placebo (n = 15) groups. Analyses found no statistically significant time-group interactions for HbA1c, diabetes-related distress or health-related quality of life. Although participants receiving OLE demonstrated greater improvements in insulin sensitivity than those on placebo, there was no significant difference between groups over time. OLE and placebo were found to be well-tolerated, with no severe or serious adverse events reported in either group. CONCLUSION: The ESOLED trial has provided preliminary evidence on the tolerability of OLE in adults with type 2 diabetes, but was inconclusive in determining whether OLE is effective at improving glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity, diabetes-related distress and quality of life. Larger trials and further exploration of the bioavailability of OLE are needed to fully assess the therapeutic potential of OLE in diabetes.

This study investigates the therapeutic potential of olive leaf extracts and stem cells in mitigating GDM-induced complications, particularly focusing on renal function, oxidative stress, and pancreatic cell regeneration. METHODS: Measurements were made in gravid female rats with or without intraperitoneal administration of Streptozotocin (35 mg/kg body weight). Biochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate renal function markers (urea, uric acid, creatinine) and oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase levels). Histopathological and immunohistopathological evaluations of kidney tissues were performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and specific markers (p53, Insulin, and PCNA) to assess cellular changes. RESULTS: The diabetic group exhibited significantly elevated levels of urea, uric acid, and creatinine (p<0.01) compared to the control group. Treatment with stem cells and olive leaf extracts significantly reduced these levels. Malondialdehyde levels were elevated in the diabetic group (p<0.01) but showed marked improvement in the treatment groups. Additionally, glutathione and superoxide dismutase activities were diminished in the diabetic rats (p<0.05) but increased following treatment. Histopathological and immunohistopathological analyses revealed cellular regeneration and improved tissue morphology in the treatment groups compared to the diabetic group. CONCLUSION: Stem cells and olive leaf extracts exhibit significant therapeutic potential in ameliorating renal dysfunction, oxidative stress, and tissue damage associated with GDM, highlighting their role in enhancing pancreatic cell regeneration.",

This study investigates the intricate effects of Streptozotocin on pregnant rats, unraveling its impact on Gestational Type 2 Diabetes (GTD). The research delves into the potential therapeutic roles of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and olive leaf extract (OLE) in mitigating the consequences of Streptozotocin-induced pancreatic impairment. METHODS: Female rats were divided into control group, diabetic group, group treated with stem cells after diabetes, group treated with olive leaf extract after diabetes, and group treated with olive leaf extract and stem cells after diabetes. A comprehensive analysis was conducted for all study groups, including diabetic patients' files, hormonal dynamics, histopathological changes, tissue immune responses, and antioxidant mechanisms for all study groups. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that diabetes causes changes in the level of insulin, HB A1C, Fructosamine, HOMA-IR and hormones compared to control group. On the contrary, there was a noticeable improvement in these parameters after treatment with olive leaf extract and stem cells. The results of the present study demonstrated that the combination of OLE and MSCs emerges as a promising approach, demonstrating enhanced glycemic control, modulation of insulin resistance, and improvements in pancreatic islet health. Aso, histopathological results underscore positive effects on pancreatic islet integrity.

      "abstract": "Mast cell-mediated reactions promote various allergic disease, including anaphylaxis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. Different data demonstrated an intricate relationship between the use of antihistaminic drugs, the onset of side effects, and the development of resistance, underscoring the importance to find novel therapeutic approaches to treat allergic diseases. Olive leaf extract (OLE), is a by-product of the olive tree rich in bioactive compounds, known for its numerous therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, anti-tumoral and antidiabetic effects. In this study, we investigated the effect of OLE on the mast-cell-mediated allergic inflammation using human mast cells HMC-1.2. OLE reduced histamine and β-Hexosaminidase release from HMC cells activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore A23187 (PMACI) through modulation of calcium signal. Moreover, OLE decreased the PMACI-stimulated gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human mast cells. This result was confirmed by multiplex assay in which the pre-treatment with OLE reduced the effective secretion of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8. These effects were correlated to ROS reduction and modulation of both mitochondrial mass and membrane potential. Finally, the inhibitory effect of OLE was nuclear factor (NF)-kB dependent as demonstrated by both activity assay and Western Blot analysis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that OLE inhibits mast-cell-derived allergic inflammation modulating mast cells degranulation, proinflammatory cytokines release and NF-kB activation. Therefore, OLE could represent a novel potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of mast cell-associated disorders.",

      "abstract": "Olive Leaves Extract (OLE) holds therapeutic potential, traditionally used to treat hepatic ailments, though its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study evaluated the efficacy of ethanolic OLE against Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative stress in a rat model. Phytochemical analysis was performed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). For this porous, thirty rats were divided into six groups (n = 5): Group 1 (negative control) received a standard diet, while Groups 2-6 were subjected to CCl4-induced toxicity. Group 2 served as the disease control, and Group 3 was treated with silymarin (100 mg/kg). Groups 4, 5, and 6 received OLE at 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg, respectively, for 21 days. OLE significantly modulated hepatic biomarkers (ALT, AST, ALP), increased Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC), decreased Total Oxidation Capacity (TOC), and restored levels of SOD, GSH, and CAT compared to the CCl4 group. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, elevated in the disease group, however downregulated by OLE, particularly at 300 mg/kg. Histological examination revealed normal liver integrity in the OLE-treated groups. Additionally, OLE modulated the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, NF-kB, Bcl2, and p-53. Apoptotic markers such as Nrf2, HO-1, Cytochrome c, caspase 3, caspase 7, and Bax were normalized with OLE treatment. The inhibition of KEAP1-NRF2 protein-protein interaction showed OLE's superior efficacy compared to silymarin, with a better docking score. These findings suggest that OLE exerts significant hepatoprotective effects against CCl4-induced oxidative stress and inflammation via the Nrf2-NFκB pathway.",

This randomized, triple-blinded study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of olive leaf extract (OLE) compared to acyclovir cream (Veramid 5%) in managing vesicular stage of RHL lesions. Forty patients were randomly divided into two equal groups and were instructed to apply the prescribed medication five times a day for five consecutive days. The evaluation was carried out by measuring the pain intensity on the first day before the treatment was applied (T0), 48 h (T1), and 7 days later (T2). Additionally, the day when the pain completely healed and the day when the lesion's crust fell off spontaneously were recorded. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney test at a significance level of α = 0.05. The study results indicated that there were no significant differences in pain intensity between the two groups during the three evaluation times: T0 (P = 920), T1 (P = 0.596), and T2 (P = 1.00). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the day when the pain was completely healed (P = 0.697). However, the OLE showed a statistically significant advantage regarding the day the lesions' crust fell off (P = 0.040). In conclusion, OLE may be a potential alternative treatment for RHL.Trial registration: isrctn.com ID: ISRCTN87606522, 04/09/2023.",

The characterization of PAW composition and the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content (TPC) of OLE were determined. Also, physicochemical and microbiological properties and lipid oxidation of cooked meat product coated with EF stored at +4°C for 14 d were evaluated. Cold plasma treatment increased the nitrite/nitrate concentrations and ORP value and decreased the pH value of distilled water (DW). The amount of TPC, IC50 value, and the antioxidant activity of OLE were 71.52 mg GAE/g, 0.46 mg/mL, and 77.39%, respectively. The combined use of OLE and PAW in EF during storage reduced the pH of cooked meat product. Furthermore, the addition of OLE in EF increased the b* values and reduced the a* values of cooked meat product, whereas the addition of PAW did not influence the CIE L*, a*, b* color values. The use of EF prevented lipid oxidation in cooked meat product during storage, especially the addition of OLE to the EF reduced the TBARS values. In this research, the addition of OLE to EF prepared with PAW has a promising application potential in the preservation of RTE-cooked meat products. Also, these findings suggested that OLE, a by-product from production of olive oil, might be applied as active packaging in biodegradable films."

Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate whether an olive leaf extract (OLE) improves postmenopausal symptoms, body composition, handgrip strength and blood lipid profile in postmenopausal women. In a randomized, double-blinded parallel study design, 60 healthy postmenopausal women aged 47-70 years received either OLE (250 mg/day) or placebo supplementation for 12 weeks. Postmenopausal symptoms were assessed with the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQoL), the Hot Flash Interference scale (HFI), and body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) with a DXA scan; the lipid profile was measured in the blood serum. After six and twelve weeks of OLE supplementation, the overall MENQoL score significantly improved (estimated mean difference [95% CI]: -0.2 [-0.4-0.2], p = 0.027) compared to the placebo. A significant improvement (+0.017 [0.003, 0.030], p = 0.019) was recorded in the BMD in the right arm in the OLE group compared to the placebo. The intervention did not affect other body composition outcomes. TG concentrations and the TG/HDL-C ratio were significantly decreased (-0.1 [-0.2, 0.0], p = 0.010; -0.1 [-0.2, -0.0], p = 0.029, respectively) in the OLE group compared to the placebo. Twelve weeks of daily OLE supplementation improved postmenopausal symptoms. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed effects.",

Objective: To examine, for the first time, in humans the effect of the daily consumption of a beverage containing olive leaf extract (OLE) versus a Mediterranean diet (MeDi) on patients diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD), in addition to their regular treatment. Methods: A randomized clinical trial compared OLE's effects on cognitive and functional performance in 55 mild AD patients. Each participant was randomly assigned to two groups: (1) Group 1 was given olive leaves for making a daily beverage and MeDi instructions through monthly diet programs; (2) Group 2 received only the MeDi instructions. After six months, all participants underwent a second neuropsychological evaluation. Results: Group 1 participants had statistically significantly higher MMSE scores compared to Group 2 with a p-value of 0.0135. Specifically, the mean MMSE difference in patients receiving OLE was close to 0, indicating no memory deterioration, whereas in controls it was -4.1, indicative of cognitive decline. The remaining neuropsychological assessments (FRSSD, FUCAS, ADAS-Cog, CDR, GDS, and NPI) revealed better results in the OLE group, except for GDS, which showed no change, but without statistically significant differences between the two groups."

METHODS: Rats were allocated into six groups; group I served as the negative control. Group II received 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in its drinking water for 1 week. Group III was injected with a single dose of 1 × 106 bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) intravenously. Group IV was treated as in group III after 5% DSS treatment. Group V was given 5% DSS, followed by olive leaf extract (OLE) (1000 mg/ kg, oral). Group VI: 5% DSS for 1 week, then was exposed to low-dose gamma radiation (LDR) (0.05 Gy). RESULTS: Rats treated with OLE, BM-MSCs, or exposed to LDR exerted significant alleviation in all hepatic biomarkers, significant enhancements in oxidative stress parameters, and improvements in inflammatory biomarkers Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and Interferon gamma (INF-γ) hepatic contents compared with those of the DSS group. Histological pictures emphasized the biochemical findings. CONCLUSIONS: BM-MSCs might be a valuable therapeutic approach to overcome hepatic injury. Exposure to LDR provided protective mechanisms that allow the body to survive better."

They have been shown to protect various played a role in protecting organs from damage. This current study aims to evaluate the impact of the treatment of olive leaf extract (OLE), bone marrow-derived (BM-MSCs), and their combination on hepatotoxicity in pregnant rats with diabetes. METHODS: Animals were divided into five groups (10 pregnant rats each) as follows: control, GDM group, and OLE group (rats received streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 35 mg/kg body weight). GD + OLE set (pregnant rats were administered OLE at a dose of 200 mg extract/kg of body weight). GD + MSCs group (pregnant rats treated with MSCs). GD + OLE + MSCs group (pregnant rats were treated with both MSCs and OLE). RESULTS: STZ induced significant changes in liver parameters, lipid profile, and oxidative stress. Treatment with OLE, BM-MSCs, and their combination significantly ameliorated STZ-induced liver damage and oxidative stress. STZ resulted in a significant change in liver parameters, lipid profile, and oxidative stress. OLE, BM-MSC, and combination have significantly improved STZ-induced deterioration in liver and improved oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that OLE and BM-MSCs have beneficial effects in mitigating diabetes-related liver alterations. These outcomes showed that OLE and BM-MSC have beneficial effects in alleviating diabetes-related alterations in the liver.",

MATERIALS AND METHOD: The susceptibility of 60 clinical isolates of the Candida species (36 C. albicans, 16 C. krusei, 5 C. glabrata and 3 C. tropicalis) was tested with four concentrations of OLE (60 µg/µL, 120 µg/µL, 240 µg/µL and 333 µg/µL) and the synergistic effect of standard antifungal therapy and OLE (miconazole (MIC) + 333 µg/µL OLE and nystatin (NYS) + 333 µg/µL OLE). The antimicrobial activity was tested using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: All concentrations (60 µg/µL, 120 µg/µL, 240 µg/µL and 333 µg/µL) of OLE showed a statistically significant effect on all Candida species compared to the control (DMSO) except for the lowest concentration (60 µg/µL) tested on C. glabrata. There was a dose-dependent effect of OLE on tested samples. Concentrations of 240 µg/µL and 333 µg/µL showed statistically significant higher antifungal activity compared to the lowest concentration of 60 µg/µL. No statistically significant synergistic effect of OLE and standard antifungal therapy was found compared with standard therapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study present the significant antimicrobial effect of OLE against all tested Candida species except for the lowest concentration on C. glabrata. Increasing the concentration of OLE also increases its effect on Candida species. This indicates the possible potential effect of OLE in the treatment of Candida-related oral diseases."

      "abstract": "Despite recent medical progress, cervical cancer remains a major global health concern for women. Current standard treatments have limitations such as non-specific toxicity that necessitate development of safer and more effective therapeutic strategies. This research evaluated the combinatorial effects of olive leaf extract (OLE), rich in anti-cancer polyphenols, and the oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) against human cervical cancer cells. OLE was efficiently encapsulated (>94% loading) within MF59 lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs; contains Precirol as NLC-P, contains Lecithin as NLC-L) to enhance stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. Physicochemical analysis confirmed successful encapsulation of OLE within nanoparticles smaller than 150 nm. In vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrated significantly higher toxicity of the OLE-loaded nanoparticle formulations on HeLa cancer cells versus HDF normal cells (P<0.05). MF59 achieved the highest encapsulation efficiency, while NLC-P had the best drug release profile. NDV selectively infected and killed HeLa cells versus HDF cells. Notably, combining NDV with OLE-loaded nanoparticles led to significantly enhanced synergistic cytotoxicity against cancer cells (P<0.05), with NLC-P (OLE) and NDV producing the strongest effects. Apoptosis and cell cycle analyses confirmed the increased anti-cancer activity of the combinatorial treatment, which induced cell cycle arrest. This study provides evidence that co-delivery of OLE-loaded lipid nanoparticles and NDV potentiates anti-cancer activity against cervical cancer cells in vitro through a synergistic mechanism, warranting further development as a promising alternative cervical cancer therapy.",

As such, we aimed to evaluate the capacity of Oleuropein (OLE), the major bio-phenol in olive leaf, to protect human sperm against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inducing sperm oxidative stress and defective sperm functions. The toxic effect of OLE on human sperm was firstly investigated by evaluating sperm parameters after incubation during 60 minutes with different concentrations. Determined non-toxic concentration was then used to evaluate the capacity of OLE to protect sperm against LPS oxidative damages and sperm parameters alterations. Thus, sperms were consecutively incubated with LPS (10 µg/mL) and OLE (40 µg/mL) during 60 minutes, then submitted to sperm parameters analysis and oxidative stress assessment by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl groups (CG) levels and the activity of some antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). A significant decrease of sperm parameters as well as a significant increase in MDA levels, CG levels, SOD and CAT activities was found after stimulation by LPS. However, a non-significant difference was shown comparing sperms treated by LPS and OLE with LPS-treated control sperms. Consequently, despite the high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of OLE reported in diverse cells, this phenolic compound seems to be not appropriate to protect human sperm in vitro against induced LPS oxidative stress and seems to have a \"double-edged sword\" behavior.",

With no definitive treatment available, urgent research into affordable and biocompatible therapeutic agents is extremely urgent. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2), and Furin enzymes, which allow the virus to enter cells, are particularly important as potential drug targets among scientists. Olive leaf extract (OLE) has garnered attention for its potential against Coronavirus Disease-9 (COVID-19), yet its mechanism remains understudied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of OLE on ACE-2, TMPRSS2, and Furin protein expressions by cell culture study. Total phenol, flavonoid content, and antioxidant capacity were measured by photometric methods, and oleuropein levels were measured by liquid LC-HR-MS. Cell viability was analyzed by ATP levels using a luminometric method. ACE-2, TMPRSS2, and Furin expressions were analyzed by the Western Blotting method. ACE-2, TMPRSS2, and Furin protein expression levels were significantly lower in a dose dependent manner and the highest inhibition was seen at 100 μg/ml OLE. The results showed that OLE may be a promising treatment candidate for COVID-19 disease. However, further studies need to be conducted in cells co-infected with the virus.",

Cardiovascular diseases, primarily coronary heart disease and stroke, are leading causes of mortality globally. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to assess the impact of OLE on cardiometabolic risk factors in adults. The selection of studies was based on intervention and outcomes, using relevant search descriptors. DATA SOURCES: The databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched for pertinent studies published up to August 2021. DATA EXTRACTION: Only randomized clinical trials, either cross-over or parallel, involving adult individuals aged ≥18 years, were considered. Additionally, trials that had a comparative or placebo group and used pure OLEs for oral treatment were included. DATA ANALYSIS: Twelve randomized clinical trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. These trials had follow-up periods ranging from 2 days to 12 weeks and involved 703 patients aged 18 years-79 years. The outcomes demonstrated a positive correlation between the intervention group and glucose metabolism (4 RCTs), blood pressure (2 RCTs), lipid profile (2 RCTs), and inflammatory markers (2 RCTs). The RoB2 tool and the GRADE system were used to evaluate the risk of bias and the quality of evidence in the studies. CONCLUSIONS: In the meta-analysis, fasting glycemia, as evaluated in studies using a low dose of OLE, showed a significant result favoring the control group. To obtain more consistent results, further clinical studies in humans, using similar methodologies, are required. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration no. CRD42020200877.",

The present study was designed to evaluate whether pretreatment of olive oil and leaf extract can attenuate the most important destructive processes in cerebral ischemia called excitotoxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The male rats were categorized into control, virgin olive oil (OVV), MCAO, MCAO + OVV (with doses of 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 ml/kg as treatment groups), olive leaf extract, MCAO + olive leaf extract (with doses 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg as treatment groups) groups. Rats of treatment groups received gastric gavage with olive oil or leaf extract for 30 consecutive days. After pretreatment, the intraluminal filament technique was used to block middle cerebral artery (MCA) transiently. Neurological deficits, infarct volume and expression of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3) proteins were measured. RESULTS: The results revealed that olive oil at doses of 0.50 and 0.75 ml/kg reduced the infarction and neurological score and upregulated NCXs expression in rat brain. In addition, olive leaf extract at doses of 75 and 100 mg/kg attenuated the infarction and neurological score and enhanced NCXs expression in rat brain. CONCLUSION: These findings support the view that olive oil and leaf extract play the neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia due to the upregulation of NCXs protein expression.",

Thus, 96 laying hens of the ISA-Brown breed were allocated to 48 experimental cages with two hens in each cage, resulting in 12 replicates per treatment. Treatments were: T1 (Control: basal diet); T2 (1% olive leaf extract); T3 (2.5% olive leaf extract); T4 (Positive control: 0.1% encapsulated oregano oil). Eggshell weight and thickness were improved in all treatments compared to the control, with T2 being significantly higher till the end of the experiment (p < 0.001). Egg yolk MDA content was lower for the T2 and T4 groups, while total phenol content and Haugh units were greater in the T2. The most improved fatty acid profile was the one of T3 yolks. The α-tocopherol yolk content was higher in all groups compared to T1. No effect was observed on cholesterol content at any treatment. Based on the findings, it can be inferred that the inclusion of olive leaf extract at a concentration of 1% in the diet leads to enhancements in specific egg quality attributes, accompanied by an augmentation of the antioxidant capacity."

AIM: This study was conducted to demonstrate the pathogenetic, morphologic, and toxicologic effects of doxorubicin on the heart and to investigate how the MAPK /TNF-α pathway can be modulated to improve doxorubicin-Induced cardiac lesions using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and olive leaf extract (OLE). METHODS: During the study, 40 adult male rats were used. Ten were used to donate MSCs, and the other 30 were split into 5 equal groups: Group I was the negative control, Group II obtained oral OLE, Group III obtained an intraperitoneal cumulative dose of DOX (12 mg/kg) in 6 equal doses of 2 mg/kg every 48 h for 12 days, Group IV obtained intraperitoneal DOX and oral OLE at the same time, and Group V obtained intraperitoneal DOX and BM-MSCs through the tail vein at the same time for 12 days. Four weeks after their last dose of DOX, the rats were euthanized. By checking the bioinformatic databases, a molecularly targeted path was selected. Then the histological, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression of ERK, JNK, NF-κB, IL-6, and TNF-α were done. RESULTS: Myocardial immunohistochemistry revealed severe fibrosis, cell degeneration, increased vimentin, and decreased CD-31 expression in the DOX-treated group, along with a marked shift in morphometric measurements, a disordered ultrastructure, and overexpression of inflammatory genes (ERK, NF-κB, IL-6, and TNF-α), oxidative stress markers, and cardiac biomarkers. Both groups IV and V displayed reduced cardiac fibrosis or inflammation, restoration of the microstructure and ultrastructure of the myocardium, downregulation of inflammatory genes, markers of oxidative stress, and cardiac biomarkers, a notable decline in vimentin, and an uptick in CD-31 expression. In contrast to group IV, group V showed a considerable beneficial effect. CONCLUSION: Both OLE and BM-MSCs showed an ameliorating effect in rat models of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, with BM-MSCs showing a greater influence than OLE.",

      "abstract": "Natural resources have recently received considerable attention as complementary or alternative hematinic agents. In this regard, olive leaf extract, which is rich in bioactive phenolic compounds, has been reported to induce erythroid differentiation in human hematopoietic stem cells. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to explore the potential hematinic properties of aqueous olive leaf extract (WOL) in vivo. After 24 days of administering WOL to healthy mice orally, red blood cell (RBC), hematocrit, reticulocyte, and reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) showed a significant increase. Additionally, WOL promoted plasma iron levels and the expression of splenic ferroportin (Fpn), an iron transporter. Additionally, a single-arm pilot study involving a limited number of healthy volunteers was conducted to assess WOL's feasibility, compliance, and potential benefits. Following an 8-week intervention with WOL, RBC count and hemoglobin level were significantly increased. Notably, there were no significant changes in the safety measures related to liver and kidney functions. Furthermore, we identified oleuropein and oleuroside as the active components in WOL to induce erythroid differentiation in the K562 cell line. Altogether, our study presents evidence of the hematinic potential of WOL in the in vivo studies, opening up exciting possibilities for future applications in preventing or treating anemia.",

      "abstract": "Olive leaves are byproducts οf the agro-industrial sector and are rich in bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties. They could be supplemented in poultry diets powdered or less frequently as extracts to improve performance, health and product quality. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible beneficial effects of an aqueous isopropanol olive leaf extract-purified through filtration (250-25 µm) and a resin (XAD-4)-when supplemented in broiler chickens' diets, on meat quality parameters, focusing mainly on antioxidant parameters as there is limited published information. For this purpose, four-hundred-and-eighty-day-old broilers were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: T1 (control: basal diet); T2 (1% olive leaf extract); T3 (2.5% olive leaf extract); T4 (positive control: 0.1% encapsulated oregano oil commercially used as feed additive). At the end of the experimental period (day 42), the birds were slaughtered, and samples from breast, thigh meat and liver were collected for antioxidant parameters evaluation. On day 1, after slaughter, in thigh meat, Malondialdehyde (MDA) was lower in T2 compared to T3, and total phenolic content (TPC) was higher in T2 compared to T3 and T4. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was increased in T2 and T4 breast meat compared to the control. In liver, T4 treatment resulted in higher TPC. The lack of dose-dependent effect for olive leaf extract may be attributed to the pro-oxidant effects of some bioactive compounds found in olive leaves, such as oleuropein, when supplemented at higher levels. In summary, it can be inferred that the inclusion of 1% olive leaf extract in the feed of broilers has the potential to mitigate oxidation in broiler meat and maybe enhance its quality."

Under optimal conditions, CNPs were able to accommodate the OLE with a loading capacity of 97.5%. The resulting OLE-CNPs had a spherical morphology, and their average diameter was approximately 100 nm. The cytotoxic influence, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis stage of OLE and OLE-CNPs were analyzed on lung carcinoma (A549) and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines. In an in vitro cytotoxic assay, IC50 values of OLE-CNPs were determined to be 540 μg/mL for A549 and 810 μg/mL for MCF-7. The treatment of both A549 and MCF-7 with OLE-CNPs caused the highest cell arrest in G0/G1 in a dose-independent manner. OLE-CNPs affected cell cycle distribution in a manner different from free OLE treatment in both cancer cells. A549 and MCF-7 cells were predominantly found in the late apoptosis and necrosis phases, respectively, upon treatment of 1000 μM OLE-CNPs. Our results suggest that CNPs enhance the utility of OLEs as nutraceuticals in cancer and that OLE-CNPs can be utilized as an adjunct to cancer therapy."

In this study, we immobilized olive leaf extract (OLE) by calcium alginate (CA) and chitosan-coated CA (CCA) and characterized the OLE-loaded CA and CCA. The cytotoxic effect, the cell cycle arrest, and the apoptotic effect of OLE and its microcapsules were investigated against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and lung carcinoma (A549). As a result, the loading capacity of OLE-CA and OLE-CCA was found to be 80 and 99%, respectively, in optimal conditions. Also, OLE-CA and OLE-CCA were characterized by unique FTIR peaks and morphological display relative to the empty CCA microcapsules. The cytotoxicity analysis showed that the IC50 values of OLE-CA and OLE-CCA were determined to be 312 and 0.94 μg mL-1 against A549, respectively, whereas these were found to be 865.4 and 425.5 μg mL-1 for MCF-7 cells. On the other hand, the OLE microcapsules did not possess in any concentration of cytotoxic influence on the BEAS 2B healthy cell line. Also, the exposure of OLE-CCA to MCF-7 and A549 resulted in the arrest of more MCF-7 and A549 cells at the G0/G1 phase compared to the OLE. A549 and MCF-7 cells were predominantly found in the late apoptosis phase and necrosis phase, respectively. Optical microscopy images confirmed that OLE microcapsules were more effective against MCF-7 and A549 than free OLE. The present work suggested that the OLE microcapsules might be administered as nutrition supplements for cancer therapy."

The lack of normal CFTR channel activity is associated with chronic infection and inflammation which are the primary causes of declining lung function in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Moreover, LPS-dependent oxidative stress downregulates CFTR function in airway epithelial cells. Olive leaf extract (OLE) is used in traditional medicine for its effects, including anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory ones. We found that OLE decreased the intracellular ROS levels in a dose-response manner in CFBE cells. Moreover, OLE attenuates the inflammatory response to LPS or IL-1β/TNFα stimulation, mimicking the infection and inflammatory status of CF patients, in CFBE and primary nasal epithelial (HNE) cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OLE restored the LPS-mediated decrease of TrikfaftaTM-dependent F508del-CFTR function in CFBE and HNE cultures. These findings provide strong evidence of OLE to prevent redox imbalance and inflammation that can cause chronic lung damage by enhancing the antioxidant activity and attenuating inflammation in CF airway epithelial cells. Additionally, OLE might be used in combination with CFTR modulators therapy to improve their efficacy in CF patients.",

      "abstract": "Fatty liver is a disease characterized by a buildup of lipids in the liver, often resulting from excessive consumption of high-fat-containing foods. Fatty liver can degenerate, over time, into more severe forms of liver diseases, especially when oxidative stress occurs. Olive leaf extract (OLE) is a reliable source of polyphenols with antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties that have been successfully used in medicine, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. Using \"green\" solvents with minimal impact on the environment and human health, which simultaneously preserves the extract's beneficial properties, represents one of the major challenges of biomedical research. In the present study, we assayed the potential antioxidant and lipid-lowering effect of a \"green\" OLE obtained by a water ultrasound-assisted extraction procedure, on the human hepatic HuH7 cell line, treated with a high concentration of free fatty acids (FFA). We found that high FFA concentration induced lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, as measured by increased hydrogen peroxide levels. Moreover, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, was reduced upon FFA treatment. Coincubation of high FFA with OLE reduced lipid and H2O2 accumulation and increased the activity of peroxide-detoxifying enzymes. OLE ameliorated mitochondrial membrane potential, and hepatic parameters by restoring the expression of enzymes involved in insulin signaling and lipid metabolism. Electron microscopy revealed an increased autophagosome formation in both FFA- and FFA + OLE-treated cells. The study of the autophagic pathway indicated OLE's probable role in activating lipophagy.",

The degree of 'secondary damage,' which is caused by a variety of cellular, molecular, and biochemical cascades is linked to the outcome of SCI. According to research, the beneficial effects of oleuropein and its derivatives have been linked to radical scavenging/antioxidant actions and anti-inflammatory effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was divided into six groups: control negative (sham-operated) group, control positive 1 and 2 (early chronic and chronic), treatment groups 1, 2, and 3 (prophylactic, concomitant, and late). Olive leaf extract (OLE) given dose was 350 mg/kg body weight. Blood was taken from the left corotic artery before the animals were terminated, seromarker assessment, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of IL-6, TNF-α, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and assessment of functional motoric outcome before the animal was terminated. RESULTS: Chronic spinal cord compression increased serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and decreased serum level of BDNF. OLE 350 mg/kg body weight decreased serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α and increased functional motoric outcome, especially in prophylactic and concomitant therapy. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that OLE may be effective in protecting chronic SCI model. CONCLUSION: Oleuropein has a potential effect to reduce the IL-6 and TNF-α in rabbit model of SCI, and the BDNF value risen after the administration of Oleuropein."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study focused on the effect of isothermal treatment (5-90 °C) and pH (2.0-6.0) of aqueous olive leaf phenolic extract solutions on the kinetics of degradation of single and total phenolic compounds and radical scavenging activity, with the objective of predicting and optimizing the thermal treatments in foods enriched with olive leaf extracts. RESULTS: The major compound, oleuropein, showed higher degradation at low pH 2.0 and temperature-dependent reaction rates, which fitted well a first-order kinetic model, with an estimated activation energy of 98.03 ± 0.08 kJ mol-1 . Oleuropein hydrolysis resulted in a zero-order increase in hydroxytyrosol concentration at same pH (Ea  = 71.59 ± 1.5 kJ mol-1 ), whereas a 100-fold slower degradation rate was observed at higher pH. Verbascoside was only degraded at pH 6.0, also following first-order kinetics. These changes in oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol concentrations led to significant changes in fluorescence maximum intensities centered around 315 and 360 nm and in the 425-500 nm spectral zone for samples at pH 6.0, which could be associated with verbacoside degradation. Conversely, analysis of total phenolic content and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity showed little changes, indicating a rather constant overall reducing capacity of the resulting pool of compounds after thermal treatments. CONCLUSION: The present study can contribute to the knowledge related to oleuropein and phenolic fraction degradation as a result of matrix (pH) and processing. The kinetic parameters obtained could be applied for predicting and optimizing the thermal treatments in foods and drinks enriched with olive leaf extracts. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "The key role of fibrosis and hypertrophy processes in developing diabetes-induced heart injury has been demonstrated. Considering the known hypoglycemic effects of olive leaf extract (OLE), we decided to investigate its potential effect and associated mechanisms on cardiac fibrosis and myocardial hypertrophy in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Eight groups were included in this study: control, diabetic, diabetic-OLEs (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), diabetic-metformin (300 mg/kg), diabetic-valsartan (30 mg/kg), and diabetic-metformin/valsartan (300/30 mg/kg). After a treatment period of 6 weeks, echocardiography was used to assess cardiac function. Heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) were measured. Myocardial histology was examined by Masson's trichrome staining. Gene expressions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), TGF-β1, TGF-β3, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen were evaluated by the quantitative real-time PCR in heart tissue. A reduction in the FBS level and HW/BW ratio in the extract groups was obvious. The improvement of left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac myocytes hypertrophy, and myocardial interstitial fibrosis was also observed in treated groups. A lowering trend in the expression of all hypertrophic and fibrotic indicator genes was evident in the myocardium of OLE treated rats. Our data indicated that OLE could attenuate fibrosis and reduce myocardial hypertrophy markers, thus improving the cardiac function and structure in the STZ-induced diabetic rats. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that olive leaf extract in addition to lowering blood glucose levels and the heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) may also improve cardiac function and reduce cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in cardiac tissue, which leads to inhibition of diabetic heart damage. Thus it is possible that including olive leaf extracts in the diets of individuals with diabetes may assist in lowering cardiovascular disease risk factors.",

Olive leaf extract (OLE) exhibits potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties. Twenty-two mature male rats were divided into four groups: control (saline), CPF (9 mg/kg), OLE (150 mg/kg), and CPF + OLE. Treatment was administered orally for 80 days. The CPF significantly reduced serum sex hormones, sperm counts and motility, high oxidants (MDA), and depleted antioxidants (GSH, SOD, TAC) in the brain and testes homogenate; additionally, it decreased serum AChE and brain neurotransmitters, increased Bax, decreased Bcl-2, and boosted caspase-3 immune expression in neural and testicular cells. Immunological expression of Ki 67 in the cerebrum, cerebellum, choroid plexus, and hippocampus was reduced, and α-SMA in testicular tissue also decreased. Histopathological findings were consistent with the above impacts. OLE co-administration significantly normalized all these abnormalities.

Due to their biocompatibility and biodegradation, PHAs have been proposed for biomedical applications, including tissue engineering scaffolds. Olive leaf extract (OLE) can be obtained from agri-food biowaste and is a source of polyphenols with remarkable antioxidant properties. This study aimed at incorporating OLE inside poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBHV) fibers via electrospinning to obtain bioactive bio-based blends that are useful in wound healing. PHBHV/OLE electrospun fibers with a size of 1.29 ± 0.34 µm were obtained. Fourier transform infrared chemical analysis showed a uniform surface distribution of hydrophilic -OH groups, confirming the presence of OLE in the electrospun fibers. The main OLE phenols were released from the fibers within 6 days. The biodegradation of the scaffolds in phosphate buffered saline was investigated, demonstrating an adequate stability in the presence of metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), an enzyme produced in chronic wounds. The scaffolds were preliminarily tested in vitro with HFFF2 fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes, suggesting adequate cytocompatibility. PHBHV/OLE fiber meshes hold promising features for wound healing, including the treatment of ulcers, due to the long period of durability in an inflamed tissue environment and adequate cytocompatibility.",

      "abstract": "Olive tree leaves are an abundant source of bioactive compounds with several beneficial effects for human health, including a protective role against many types of cancer. In this study, we investigated the effect of an extract, obtained from olive tree (Olea europaea L.) leaves (OLE), on proliferation, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) on metastatic melanoma, the highly aggressive form of skin cancer and the deadliest diseases. Our results demonstrated that OLE inhibited melanoma cells proliferation through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, OLE suppressed the migration, invasion, and colonies formation of human melanoma cells. Similar to our in vitro findings, we demonstrated that the oral administration of OLE inhibited cutaneous tumor growth and lung metastasis formation in vivo by modulating the expression of EMT related factors. In addition, the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects of OLE against melanoma were also related to a simultaneous targeting of mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3K pathways, both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our findings suggest that OLE has the potential to inhibit the metastatic spread of melanoma cells thanks to its multifaceted mechanistic effects, and may represent a new add-on therapy for the management of metastatic melanoma.",

      "abstract": "Nutraceuticals are products of natural origin widely used for the treatment and/or prevention of some chronic diseases that are highly prevalent in Western countries, such as obesity or type II diabetes, among others. However, its possible use in the prevention of acute diseases that can put life at risk has been poorly studied. Sepsis is an acute condition that causes cardiovascular and skeletal muscle damage due to a systemic inflammatory state. The aim of this work was to evaluate the possible beneficial effect of a new nutraceutical based on a mixture of algae oil (AO) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) supplemented with an olive leaf extract (OLE) in the prevention of cardiovascular alterations and skeletal muscle disorders induced by sepsis in rats. For this purpose, male Wistar rats were treated with the nutraceutical or with water p.o. for 3 weeks and after the treatment they were injected with 1mg/kg LPS twice (12 and 4 h before sacrifice). Pretreatment with the nutraceutical prevented the LPS-induced decrease in cardiac contractility before and after the hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. At the vascular level, supplementation with the nutraceutical did not prevent hypotension in septic animals, but it attenuated endothelial dysfunction and the increased response of aortic rings to the vasoconstrictors norepinephrine and angiotensin-II induced by LPS. The beneficial effects on cardiovascular function were associated with an increased expression of the antioxidant enzymes SOD-1 and GSR in cardiac tissue and SOD-1 and Alox-5 in arterial tissue. In skeletal muscle, nutraceutical pretreatment prevented LPS-induced muscle proteolysis and autophagy and significantly increased protein synthesis as demonstrated by decreased expression of MURF-1, atrogin-1, LC3b and increased MCH-I and MCH -IIa in gastrocnemius muscle. These effects were associated with a decrease in the expression of TNFα, HDAC4 and myogenin. In conclusion, treatment with a new nutraceutical based on a mixture of AO and EVOO supplemented with OLE is useful to prevent cardiovascular and muscular changes induced by sepsis in rats. Thus, supplementation with this nutraceutical may constitute an interesting strategy to reduce the severity and mortality risk in septic patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory process and apoptosis are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac injury and oxidative damage caused by diabetes mellitus. The cardioprotective effects of standardized aqueous ethanolic olive leaf extract (OLE), metformin (as a cardiovascular protective agent) and valsartan (as an angiotensin receptor blocker) in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were evaluated. METHODS: Wistar rats divided into control, diabetic, OLE-treated (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), metformin (300 mg/kg)-treated, valsartan (30 mg/kg)-treated and metformin/valsartan-treated diabetic groups. Biochemical parameters, including malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activates, and the total contents of thiol were measured, and histopathological and gene expression studies were done on cardiac tissues. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) and cardiac injury markers were examined in serum. KEY FINDINGS: FBS; the serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST); and heart tissue MDA levels due to diabetes were significantly alleviated by OLE treatment (effect size; ηp2 = 0.934, 0.888, 0.848, 0.888 and 0.879, respectively), and SOD and CAT activity and the thiol content in heart tissue were significantly increased (effect size; ηp2 = 0.770, 0.749 and 0.753, respectively). Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells were reduced in cardiac tissues of OLE-treated groups compared with the diabetic rats (effect size; ηp2 = 0.969 and 0.949, respectively). OLE up-regulated BCL2 gene expression and down-regulated BAX gene expression in cardiac tissue (effect size; ηp2= 0.490 and 0.522, respectively). CONCLUSION: OLE in a dose-dependent manner ameliorates cardiac damage in diabetic cardiomyopathy, perhaps through attenuating inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

HHP and P led to a significant reduction in yeast and aerobic mesophiles after the conservation treatment and during storage (300 days). The physical-chemical properties changed slightly during storage, except for olive hardness; olives treated with HHP presented a higher hardness than pasteurized ones. The CIELAB parameter L* decreased until day 300 in most of the treatments, as well as phenols. The HHP treatment led to significantly higher contents of phenolics (even during storage) than olives submitted to P. Some sensory attributes (colour, aspect, hardness, and overall evaluation) decreased during storage. P treatment caused a decrease in appearance, aroma, hardness, and overall evaluation compared to olives treated with HHP. Thus, the application of HHP in table olives to increase the shelf-life can be considered a valid alternative to P.",

Recent studies suggest that olive extracts suppress inflammation and reduce stress oxidative injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential neuroprotective effects of olive leaf extract (OLE) in an experimental cervical spondylotic myelopathy model. METHODS: This study was divided into 6 groups; Control Negative (Sham-Operated) Group, Control Positive 1 & 2 (early chronic and chronic), Treatment Groups 1, 2 & 3 (prophylactic, concomitant & late). Olive leaf extract (OLE) give 350 mg/kg BW and spinal cord sample was taken at the compression level C5. Histopathological assessment and immunohistochemistry of Amyloid-β, p-Tau, TDP-43 dan CD-68 dan evaluation of functional motoric outcome was done before animals were terminated. RESULTS: Chronic spinal cord compression increased the expression of Amyloid-β, p-Tau, TDP-43 dan CD-68. OLE 350 mg/kg BW decreased the expression of these biomarkers and increased functional motoric outcome, especially as prophylactic dan concomitant treatment. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that OLE may be effective in protecting cervical spondylotic myelopathy."

      "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a regulated foodborne pathogen that is known to cause listeriosis, a disease associated with high mortality rates in humans. Olive leaf extract (OLE) has been shown to act as a plant antimicrobial and inhibit the growth of pathogens, such as L. monocytogenes, although its mode of action has not been defined. To help identify the cellular mechanisms important for conveying these beneficial traits, RNA-Seq was used to study the transcriptome of L. monocytogenes upon exposure to a sublethal level of OLE. Results obtained from cells cultured both with and without OLE at two different time points (3.5-h and 24-h) revealed 661 genes that were differentially expressed. Of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified, transcription was altered for 171 genes in response to the 3.5-h OLE treatment while 490 genes were altered in response to the 24-h OLE treatment. These DEGs included but were not limited to genes encoding for signal transduction, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and the phosphotransferase system. Interestingly, several virulence-related genes were downregulated including an ABC transporter permease previously shown to negatively regulate biofilm formation, genes involved in flagella assembly and binding/entry into host cells as well as those regulating acid resistance suggesting that OLE may decrease the virulence potential of L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR was used to validate the data obtained via RNA-Seq. Our study provides insight into the mode of action of OLE treatment against L. monocytogenes and may aid in identifying synergetic strategies to inhibit L. monocytogenes in food."

We carried out an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial. The participants were randomly stratified according to age and they were assigned to one of the two study groups: Standard weight loss diet (estimated daily energy requirements minus 500 kcal) + OLE supplementation (n = 35) in intervention group or Standard weight loss diet (estimated daily energy requirements minus 500 kcal) + placebo (n = 35) in placebo group. The study groups were homogeneous regarding the baseline age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumferences, married status, and physical activity levels (p > 0.05). The results of analysis of covariance presented significant decreases in BMI, fat mass, and body weight in the OLE group compared to those in the placebo group (p < 0.05). At the end of the study, the serum levels of fasting blood sugar, insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, leptin, fatty free acid, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance significantly decreased, and serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin elevated in the intervention group (p < 0.05). Based on results it seems that the addition of OLE to a hypocaloric diet for 8-week compared with a hypocaloric diet alone may be more effective in modifying obesity and metabolic risk factors.

In this study, the addition of OLE 4:0.15 (w/w) to a mixture of algae oil (AO) rich in n-3 PUFA and EVOO (25:75, w/w) prevents peroxides formation after 12 months of storage at 30 °C. Furthermore, the treatment with the oil mixture (2.5 mL/Kg) and OLE (100 mg/Kg) to 24 month old Wistar rats for 21 days improved the lipid profile, increased the HOMA-IR and decreased the serum levels of miRNAs 21 and 146a. Treatment with this new nutraceutical also prevented age-induced insulin resistance in the liver, gastrocnemius and visceral adipose tissue by decreasing the mRNA levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Oil mixture + OLE also attenuated the age-induced alterations in vascular function and prevented muscle loss by decreasing the expression of sarcopenia-related markers. In conclusion, treatment with a new nutraceutical based on a mixture of EVOO, AO and OLE is a useful strategy for improving the stability of n-3 PUFA in the final product and to attenuate the cardiometabolic and muscular disorders associated with aging."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of olive leaf (Olea europea L.) extract (OLE) against PbAc-induced sperm toxicity, sex hormone changes, oxidative stress, and histopathological changes in rats. Twenty male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (group 1, as control; group 2, OLE; group 3, PbAc; group 4, PbAc+OLE). In the PbAc group, the body weight, testis and epididymis weights, sexual hormones, sperm characteristics, GR, GPx, GST, GSH, SOD, and CAT were significantly decreased, and the sperm abnormality and TBARS level were significant increase when compared with control and OLE groups. Also, numerous damages to testicular tissue were observed in the PbAc group when compared to the control group, while the treatment with OLE in the fourth group led to improvement of sex hormones, semen characteristics, oxidative stress, and testicular tissue damage caused by PbAc. It can be concluded that OLE has a protective and ameliorative effects against PbAc-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis and alterations in testicular tissue, and sperm quality in rats.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Olive (Olea europaea L.) plays a promising role in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic production. On the other hand, olive leaf is widely used in folk medicine due to its antihyperglycemic activity. For this aim, possible effects of olive leaf extract (OLE) in the brain tissue of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were investigated. METHODS: A total of 28 male rats were divided into four equal groups as control, diabetic (single dose of 45 mg/kg streptozotocin, i.p.), OLE (500 mg/kg/day), and diabetic + OLE groups. The study was terminated 21 days after the diabetes model was formed. At the end of the study, all the animals were sacrificed and blood and brain tissues were isolated. Relative brain weights, complete blood count, blood glycated hemoglobin, serum glucose, total protein, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, gonadal hormone levels, production and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators, total thiol, total oxidative stress, and total antioxidant status levels and fatty acid composition in brain tissue were measured in all study groups. RESULTS: In diabetic rats, relative brain weight and serum insulin level decreased, glycated hemoglobin, oxidative stress, production and mRNA level of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators increased, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, degraded fatty acid composition, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred. After OLE treatment, a remarkable improvement in most of these parameters, except gonadal hormones, has been observed in diabetic rats. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that olive leaf can be a precious neuroprotective agent in diabetes."

In this study, we aimed to analyze whether 3-week supplementation with a phenolic-rich olive leaf extract (OLE) to 24 months-old male Wistar rats orally (100 mg/kg) attenuated the aging-induced alterations in body composition and insulin resistance. OLE treatment increased brown adipose tissue and attenuated the aging-induced decrease in protein content and gastrocnemius weight. Treatment with OLE prevented the aging-induced increase in the expression of PPAR-γ in visceral and brown adipose tissues, while it significantly increased the expression of PPAR-α in the gastrocnemius of old rats and reduced various markers related to sarcopenia such as myostatin, HDAC-4, myogenin and MyoD. OLE supplementation increased insulin sensitivity in explants of gastrocnemius and epididymal visceral adipose tissue from aged rats through a greater activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, probably through the attenuation of inflammation in both tissues. In conclusion, supplementation with OLE prevents the loss of muscle mass associated with aging and exerts anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects on adipose tissue and skeletal muscle."

Increasing evidence has addressed the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory roles of olive leaf extract (OLE) in neurodegenerative diseases. So, the current study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective roles of OLE in epilepsy. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Forty rats were divided into 4 groups including a control group, sham group, kainic acid (KA) group, and KA + OLE group. KA (4 μg/rat) was injected intrahippocampal, and OLE (300 mg/kg) was orally administrated for 4 weeks. Animals were sacrificed, and their hippocampi were isolated. KA- induced seizure activity was recorded. Oxidative stress index was assessed by measuring its indicators including malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite, nitrate, and glutathione (GSH) as well as the catalase (CAT) activity. The supernatant concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the apoptosis rate in neurons were measured. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Treatment with OLE significantly reduced the seizure score. OLE decreased oxidative stress index by reducing the concentration of MDA, nitrite, and nitrate as well as increasing the level of GSH. OLE had a significant anti-apoptotic effect on neurons. However, CAT activity and the level of TNF-α were not affected. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicated neuroprotective properties of OLE, which is mainly mediated by its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects, therefore, could be considered as a valuable therapeutic supplement for epilepsy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of olive leaf extract on cardiometabolic profiles among prehypertensive and hypertensive groups. METHODOLOGY: The Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Medline (1966 to April week 1, 2020), Embase (1966 to April week 1, 2020) and trial registries for relevant randomized clinical trials were used. Published and unpublished randomized clinical trials were reviewed and evaluated. Random effects models were used to estimate the continuous outcomes and mean differences (MDs); both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic BP. The secondary outcomes were changes in lipid profile, glucose metabolism, inflammatory markers for CVD, kidney and liver functions safety parameters. We assessed the data for risk of bias, heterogeneity, sensitivity, reporting bias and quality of evidence. RESULTS: Five trials were included involving 325 patients aged 18-80 years. Two trials involved high-income countries and three trials involved moderate-income countries. The analysis performed was based on three comparisons. No significant changes were found between systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) for the first comparison, 1,000 mg per day for a combined formulation of olive leaf extract versus a placebo. The second comparison, 500 mg per day of olive leaf extract versus placebo or no treatment, showed a significant reduction in systolic BP over a period of at least 8 weeks of follow up (MD -5.78 mmHg, 95% CI [-10.27 to -1.30]) and no significant changes on diastolic BP. The third comparison, 1,000 mg per day of olive leaf extract versus placebo shows no significant difference but an almost similar reduction in systolic BP (-11.5 mmHg in olive leaf extract and -13.7 mmHg in placebo, MD 2.2 mmHg, 95% CI [-0.43-4.83]) and diastolic BP (-4.8 mmHg in olive leaf extract and -6.4 mmHg in placebo, MD 1.60 mmHg, 95% CI [-0.13-3.33]). For secondary outcomes, 1,000 mg per day of olive leaf extract versus captopril showed a reduction in LDL (MD -6.00 mg/dl, 95% CI [-11.5 to -0.50]). The 500 mg per day olive leaf extract versus placebo showed a reduction in inflammatory markers for CVD IL-6 (MD -6.83 ng/L, 95% CI [-13.15 to -0.51]), IL-8 (MD -8.24 ng/L, 95% CI [-16.00 to -0.48) and TNF-alpha (MD -7.40 ng/L, 95% CI [-13.23 to -1.57]). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this review suggest the reduction of systolic BP, LDL and inflammatory biomarkers, but it may not provide a robust conclusion regarding the effects of olive leaf extract on cardiometabolic profile due to the limited number of participants in the included trials.

      "abstract": "A novel strategy involving Olive Leaf Extract (OLE) and Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) was developed as a green antimicrobial treatment. Specifically, we reported a preliminary investigation on the combined use of OLE + CAP against three pathogens, chosen to represent medical and food industries (i.e., E. coli, S. aureus and L. innocua). The results indicated that a concentration of 100 mg/mL (total polyphenols) in OLE can exert an antimicrobial activity, but still insufficient for a total bacterial inactivation. By using plain OLE, we significantly reduced the growth of Gram positive S. aureus and L. innocua, but not Gram-negative E. coli. Instead, we demonstrated a remarkable decontamination effect of OLE + CAP in E. coli, S. aureus and L. innocua samples after 6 h. This effect was optimally maintained up to 24 h in S. aureus strain. E. coli and L. innocua grew again in 24 h. In the latter strain, OLE alone was most effective to significantly reduce bacterial growth. By further adjusting the parameters of OLE + CAP technology, e.g., OLE amount and CAP exposure, it could be possible to prolong the initial powerful decontamination over a longer time. Since OLE derives from a bio-waste and CAP is a non-thermal technology based on ionized air, we propose OLE + CAP as a potential green platform for bacterial decontamination. As a combination, OLE and CAP can lead to better antimicrobial activity than individually and may replace or complement conventional thermal procedures in food and biomedical industries.",

      "abstract": "Benolea® (EFLA®943) is a standardized dry olive leaf extract (DOLE) considered safe for food consumption and has demonstrated superior pharmaceutical benefits such as antioxidant, anti-obesity, and anti-hypertensive activities. However, there is no study on its effects on melanogenesis yet. Disruption in the sequence of steps in melanogenesis can lead to hypopigmentary disorders which occur due to reduced production or export of pigment melanin in the skin. There is a need for safe and nontoxic therapeutics for the treatment of hypopigmentation disorders. Herein, we studied the effects of DOLE over a concentration range of 10-200 µg/mL on melanin synthesis and melanin secretion in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and MNT-1 human melanoma cells and validated our results in primary human melanocytes (obtained from lightly pigmented (LP) and moderately pigmented (MP) cells) as well as their cocultures with keratinocytes. The capacity of melanocytes to export melanosomes was also estimated indirectly by the quantitation of melanocyte dendrite lengths and numbers. Our results show that DOLE significantly enhanced levels of extracellular melanin in the absence of effects on intracellular melanin, demonstrating that this plant extract's pro-melanogenic activity is primarily based on its capacity to augment melanin secretion and stimulate melanocyte dendricity. In summary, our preliminary results demonstrate that DOLE may hold promise as a pro-pigmenting agent for vitiligo therapy and gray hair treatment by its exclusive and novel mechanism of functioning as a dendrite elongator. Further studies to elucidate the mechanisms of action of the pro-melanogenic activity and effects of DOLE on melanosome export as well as the last steps of melanogenesis are warranted."

Several disorders, including hypertension and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), are associated with abnormalities in water homeostasis. It has been shown that certain phytocompounds are beneficial to human health. Here, the effects of the Olive Leaf Extract (OLE) have been evaluated using in vitro and in vivo models. Confocal studies showed that OLE prevents the vasopressin induced AQP2 translocation to the plasma membrane in MCD4 cells and rat kidneys. Incubation with OLE decreases the AVP-dependent increase of the osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf). To elucidate the possible effectors of OLE, intracellular calcium was evaluated. OLE increases the intracellular calcium through the activation of the Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR). NPS2143, a selective CaSR inhibitor, abolished the inhibitory effect of OLE on AVP-dependent water permeability. In vivo experiments revealed that treatment with OLE increases the expression of the CaSR mRNA and decreases AQP2 mRNA paralleled by an increase of the AQP2-targeting miRNA-137. Together, these findings suggest that OLE antagonizes vasopressin action through stimulation of the CaSR indicating that this extract may be beneficial to attenuate disorders characterized by abnormal CaSR signaling and affecting renal water reabsorption.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Herpes simplex virus (HSV), as a common infection in healthy individuals, is treated symptomatically, but drug resistance and the side effects of drugs have drawn the attention of researchers to complementary medicine. Olive Leaf Extract (OLE) has antiviral effects that may treat HSV. The current study aimed to compare the clinical effects of OLE and Acyclovir on HSV-1. METHODS: This randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted on 66 patients who had already been diagnosed with HSV-1. The participants were randomized into two groups, receiving 2% OLE cream or 5% acyclovir cream five times a day for six days. The symptoms were evaluated before, and three and six days after the interventions. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, chi-squared, t-test, and repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: The results showed clinical symptoms decreased in both groups during the study and both medications were effective in the treatment of HSV-1. However, the OLE group experienced less bleeding (P = 0.038), itching (P = 0.002), and pain (P = 0.001) on the third day as well as less irritation (P = 0.012), itching (P = 0.003) and color change (P = 0.001) on the sixth day compared to the acyclovir group. The treatment course for participants in the OLE group was shorter than in the acyclovir group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The evidence from these trials suggests the OLE cream is superior in the healing of episodes of HSV-1 over the acyclovir cream. Future studies are recommended to investigate if OLE could be an adjunct to acyclovir treatment.",

      "abstract": "Breast and ovarian cancers are the leading and fifth reason for tumor death among females, respectively. Recently, many studies demonstrated antiproliferative activities of natural aliments in cancer. In this study, we investigated the antitumor potential of Olive Leaf Extract (OLE) in triple-negative breast and ovarian cancer cells. A HPLC/DAD analysis on OLE has been performed to assess the total polyphenolics and other secondary metabolites content. HCEpiC, MDA-MB-231, and OVCAR-3 cell lines were used. MTS, Cytofluorimetric, Western Blot analysis were performed to analyze cell viability, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Fluorimetric and IncuCyte® analyses were carried out to evaluate apoptosis and mitochondrial function. We confirmed that OLE, containing a quantity of oleuropein of 87 % of the total extract, shows anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity on MDA-MB-231 cells. For the first time, our results indicate that OLE inhibits OVCAR-3 cell viability inducing cell cycle arrest, and it also increases apoptotic cell death up-regulating the protein level of cleaved-PARP and caspase 9. Moreover, our data show that OLE treatment causes a significant decrease in mitochondrial functionality, paralleled by a reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential. Interestingly, OLE increased the level of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) together with a decreased activity of ROS scavenging enzymes, confirming oxidative stress in both models. Our data demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS generation represented the primary mechanism of OLE antitumor activity, as pretreatment with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevented OLE-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.",

The juvenile fish (55 ± 7.6 g) were divided into different groups according to the use of added OLE (80 g kg-1 food), the presence/absence of FFC (15 mg kg-1 body weight for 10 consecutive days), and the streptococcal infectivity (2.87 × 107 CFU mL-1 as 30% of LD50-96h). The extract's chemical composition was analyzed using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The skin mucus and intestine of fish were sampled after a 10-day therapeutic period for all groups, and their noted indices were measured. Our results signified that the oleuropein, quercetin, and trans-ferulic acid were the most obvious active components of OLE which were found by HPLC analysis. The combined use of OLE and FFC could lowered some skin mucus immunological indices (e.g., TP, TIg, and ALP), and the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-1β) of rainbow trout. Moreover, lysozyme and protease activities respectively were invigorated by the FFC and OLE treatment. Also, the use of OLE as a potential medicine induced the gene expression of HAMP.

The aim was to investigated the effects of OLE on the hyperlipidemia, antioxidant defense, heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase (HO/BVR) pathway, inflammation, and fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS, a progressive form of chronic kidney disease) induced by adriamycin (2 mg/kg, i.v., twice in a 21-day period). Daily treatment of OLE (80 mg/kg, p.o.) for 6 weeks suppressed protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation (p < .01 and p < .001, respectively), significantly increased antioxidant enzymes activities and normalized antioxidant capacity, leading to the improvement of antioxidant defense independently of the HO/BVR pathway. Furthermore, the values of triglycerides (p < .01), total, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < .05, both) were improved by OLE. OLE strongly prevented glomerulosclerosis, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis (renal injury score, FSGS: 8 ± 0.45 vs. FSGS+OLE: 4.20 ± 1.07; p < .01), as evidenced by normalized fibronectin content (p < .001), suppressed interstitial inflammatory cells infiltration and collagen deposition, without changing cytokines expressions.

Evidence from previous studies has shown that extracts from olive leaves rich in olive phenolics are able to positively affect CVD risk factors, such as high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 8-week olive leaf extract (OLE) administration on blood lipid profiles in overweight/obese subjects with mildly elevated cholesterol levels. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 77 healthy adult overweight/obese subjects (aged 56 ± 10 years and BMI 29.0 ± 2.7 kg/m2) with total cholesterol levels of 5.0-8.0 mmol/L (5.9 ± 0.7 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to receive 500 mg of OLE (n = 39) or placebo (n = 38) for 8 weeks. In total, 74 subjects completed the entire study protocol. At baseline, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks of supplementation, blood lipid profiles, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), blood pressure, glucose, and insulin levels were assessed. In addition, liver function parameters were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. RESULTS: OLE supplementation did not significantly affect blood lipid levels after 4 weeks or after 8 weeks compared to placebo (all p > 0.05). For oxLDL, blood pressure, glucose, and insulin levels and liver function parameters, also no statistically significant differences were found between the two intervention groups (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Blood lipid profiles were not significantly affected by 8 weeks OLE supplementation in overweight/obese subjects with mildly elevated cholesterol levels.

There have been some studies showing the effect of olive leaf on hyperglycemia and diabetic complications due to its antioxidant properties. In many studies the effect of olive leaf on plasma total antioxidant level has been measured by different methods. Our study represents the first time it has been measured by a new method of total thiol disulfide homeostasis. Aim: chronic exposure to hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic complications through oxidative stress mediators. Thiol is one of the most important antioxidant barriers in humans, and thiol disulfide homeostasis is a new oxidative stress marker. We aimed to investigate the effect of olive leaf extract (OLE) obtained from fresh leaves of Olea europaea, var oleaster on diabetic complications through their hypoglycemic and antioxidant effect in diabetic rats. Methods: twenty-eight Wistar albino rats aged 12-13 weeks were used in the study. The rats were divided into a control group (C), a diabetic control group (DC), a diabetic group treated with 200 mg/kg OLE (D+200), and a diabetic group treated with 400 mg/kg OLE (D+400), having 7 rats in each group. The treatment groups received OLE by the gavage method for 21 days. At the end of the study, all rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Blood samples collected from the heart were centrifuged and glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, urea, uric acid, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) level, and thiol-disulfide homeostasis were determined. The hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) analysis was performed on complete blood. In addition, a tail flick test and hot plate modeling were performed to indicate pain perception loss. Results: it was observed that OLE had no effect on serum glucose and HbA1c levels. On the contrary, OLE reduced the levels of total cholesterol (p < 0.01), urea (p < 0.01) and hot plate latency (p < 0.01) in a significant manner. Also, OLE showed a tendency to reduce LOOH levels and to increase thiol levels in a dose-dependent manner (p > 0.05). Conclusion: OLE supplementation for 21 days, at the amounts used, cannot protect against hyperglycemia but may be protective against hypercholesterolemia and tissue damage as caused by diabetes mellitus in rats.",

Oleuropein was identified to have various medical properties. It was also found to inhibit the effects of both acute and chronic UVB-induced skin damage as well as accelerate wound healing activity. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of olive leaf extract-containing cream on facial rejuvenation. METHODS: This is a prospective pilot study with a total of 36 participants, who presented with photoaging skin. All participants applied the olive leaf extract-containing cream (SUPERHEAL™ O-Live Cream, PhytoCeuticals, Inc, USA) to their whole face twice daily for 2 months. Primary outcomes measured in the study were the changes in the biophysical properties of the skin assessed with the following parameters: melanin and erythema index, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration, skin pH, sebum level, texture, and wrinkles. RESULTS: After 2 months, TEWL decreased significantly (P = .007) and maintained the results 1 month after discontinuation of the treatment (P = .007). Skin hydration also increased significantly after 2 months (P = .004). Wrinkles improved significantly on all follow-ups (P < .001, P = .001, P = .001, respectively). An image of the skin captured using Visioscan® showed improvement of the skin texture 2 months after treatment. Majority of the participants (64%) noted improvement in their skin texture. CONCLUSION: Olive leaf extract-containing cream provided benefits on skin rejuvenation in human skin.",

      "abstract": "The present study was conducted to examine the protective effect of olive leaf extract (OLE) against glycerol-induced oxidative stress in rats. Sixty male albino rats were used and allocated randomly into four groups, each of 15 rats. Groups (1) and (2) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) a single dose of 500 μL normal saline and hypertonic glycerol solution (10 mL/kg b.wt., 50% v/v, in sterile saline), respectively, followed by a 24-h period of water deprivation. Group (3) was orally given OLE (500 mg/kg b.wt.) for 22 days and glycerol as mentioned above on the 14th day of OLE administration followed by a 24-h period of water deprivation. Group (4) was administered OLE alone. Five rats from each group were sacrificed and samples were collected 1, 5, and 8 days after water deprivation. Alterations in hematobiochemical parameters, renal and hepatic oxidative stress markers, as well as histopathology of the kidney and liver, were evaluated. Glycerol treatment resulted in significant hematological and biochemical alterations as well as significant renal and hepatic oxidative stress. Administration of OLE has significantly ameliorated renal dysfunction, morphological alterations of kidney and liver, and relieved the oxidative stress. These findings show obviously the role of oxidative stress and its relevance to renal dysfunction and suggest the ameliorative impact of OLE in glycerol-induced acute kidney damage in rats, possibly due to its antioxidant properties.",

      "abstract": "While acyclovir, a nucleoside analogue, is widely used for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), emergence of drug-resistant viruses due to frequent usage of this class of medicines, and their toxic side effects require exploring novel active molecules. Despite the studies on developing synthetic molecules in medical sciences and pharmacology, herbs as a natural source of biologically-active compounds remain popular. In this in vitro study, olive leaf extract (OLE) and propolis alone or in combination with acyclovir were investigated for their antiviral efficacy in HSV-1.Toxic doses of OLE, propolis, and dimethyl sulfoxide, propolis diluent, for Hep-2 (ATCC, CCL-23) cells were determined by conventional cell culture. Using \"endpoint\" method, the viral dose infecting half of the cell culture (TCID50) was calculated, and viral quantity was determined with Spearman-Karber method. Antiviral effects of OLE and propolis on HSV-1 were investigated by conventional cell culture and real-time cell analysis (RTCA). Combinations of the two extracts with one another and with acyclovir were evaluated by RTCA. Active substances prepared at three different dilutions were added to tubes with HSV-1 of logTCID50: 11.5 in descending order starting from the highest non-toxic concentration, and they were left at room temperature for two different durations (one hour and three hours). The aliquots taken from the tubes were cultured in plates containing Hep-2 cells and evaluated after 72 hours. Combinations of extracts and acyclovir at concentrations at least four times lower than the lowest concentration showing antiviral efficacy against HSV-1 were cultured with Hep-2 cells in the e-plates of the xCELLigence RTCA device, measurements were obtained at 30 minute intervals, and data were recorded in real time. In the test with two different durations and at different concentrations of OLE and propolis, antiviral efficacy was observed both with one-hour and three-hour incubation at a concentration of 10 μg/ ml for propolis and 1.2 mg/ml for OLE with RTCA. The duration and concentration of the greatest decrease in viral quantity were in the first one hour and 10 μg/ml for propolis, and in the first one hour and 1.2 mg/ ml for OLE. Combination of propolis and OLE with acyclovir caused no cytopathic effects, and the combination of extracts led to delayed cytopathic effect. According to these results, propolis and OLE, alone and in combinations with acyclovir, have antiviral efficacy against HSV-1. These agents may reduce the dose and side effects of acyclovir in case of co-administration since they exert their effects through a different mechanism than acyclovir,possibly through direct virucidal activity, inhibition of virus internalization or viral inhibition in early stages of replication (inhibition of adsorption/binding of viral particles to the cell). These extracts that do not require conversion to active form have the potential to reduce infectivity in oral lesions, prevent spread, and be used in the topical treatment of acyclovir-resistant HSV infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. However, in vivo studies should be conducted to determine their medicinal properties and potential toxicities. These results should be supported by further comprehensive studies and the efficacy against other viruses should also be investigated.",

This study is intended to investigate whether an olive leaf extract enriched in Ole (OLEO) may counteract the aerobic glycolysis exploited by tumor cells. We found that OLEO decreased melanoma cell proliferation and motility. OLEO was also able to reduce the rate of glycolysis of human melanoma cells without affecting oxidative phosphorylation. This reduction was associated with a significant decrease of glucose transporter-1, protein kinase isoform M2 and monocarboxylate transporter-4 expression, possible drivers of such glycolysis inhibition. Extending the study to other tumor histotypes, we observed that the metabolic effects of OLEO are not confined to melanoma, but also confirmed in colon carcinoma, breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. In conclusion, OLEO represents a natural product effective in reducing the glycolytic metabolism of different tumor types, revealing an extended metabolic inhibitory activity that may be well suited in a complementary anti-cancer therapy."

Dry olive (Olea europaea L.) leaf extract is known to contain bioactive and antioxidative components and to have an ability to modulate the effects of various oxidants in cells. The main goal of this study was to investigate antigenotoxic potential of a standardized dry olive leaf extract on DNA damage induced by 17β-estradiol and diethylstilbestrol in human whole blood cells in vitro, using comet assay. Our results indicated that both hormones showed a genotoxic effect at a concentration of 100 μM (P < 0.05, n = 6). Dry olive leaf extract was efficient in reducing number of cells with estrogen-induced DNA damage at tested concentrations (0.125, 0.5 and 1 mg/mL) (P < 0.05, n = 6) and under two experimental protocols, pre-treatment and post-treatment, exhibiting antigenotoxic properties. Analysis of antioxidant properties of the extract revealed moderate ABTS radical scavenging properties and reducing power. Overall, our results suggested that the protective potential of dry olive leaf extract could arise from the synergistic effect of its scavenging activity and enhancement of the cells' antioxidant capacity.",

Nuggets that did not contain any additive (C1) and the samples prepared with the coating solution that did not include any additives (C2) were assigned as controls.2. Nuggets were stored at two different temperatures, either in a refrigerator (4°C) or in a deep freezer (-18°C) for 21 days and 90 days respectively. Moisture content (%), pH, antioxidant status (TBARS), colour and microbial count (total mesophilic and psychrophilic aerobic bacteria) analyses were carried out during storage.3. At the end of refrigerator storage (day 21), TBARS values for samples in which OLE and HS were directly added were found to be lower than those with OLE and HS coatings (P < 0.05). Total number of mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria were found to be the lowest in the treatment in which HS was directly incorporated into nugget patty (P < 0.05).4.

The term 'prediabetes' applies to patients with insulin resistance but without overt T2D. The improvement of glucose homeostasis in these patients may prevent or delay the development of T2D and its complications. Data suggest that fenugreek, olive leaf polyphenols and bergamot extract may improve carbohydrate metabolism. We examined the effect of an agent containing fenugreek, olive leaf polyphenols and bergamot extract (active agent) on glucose homeostasis in patients with prediabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial; patients with prediabetes (N = 100) were randomized to treatment with the active agent or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 6 months after treatment initiation. Secondary endpoints included changes in other parameters of glucose metabolism and lipid profile. RESULTS: Overall 87 patients completed the study. No significant change in HbA1c was observed in either treatment group. Similarly, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index and lipid profile remained unaltered in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of an agent containing fenugreek, olive leaf polyphenols and bergamot extract for 6 months did not improve glycemia or lipid parameters in patients with prediabetes."

However, the use of such additives and antibiotics associated with side effects such as liver damage. Oxidative stress occurs due to an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants. Studies have shown that olive leaves have an antioxidant effect on free radicals. This study was to evaluate the possible effect of olive leaf extract on carbon tetrachloride (CCL4)-induced liver damage (molecular and tissue) and changes of enzymes in chickens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 chickens were used and classified into5 groups. Treatment groups received 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg of the olive leaf extract from day 21 of the experiment. Two control groups-healthy and poisoned-did not receive any extract. On the day 35 of the experiment, 1cc of CCL4 was dissolved with olive oil and injected intraperitoneally into the experimental and poisoned control groups. Blood and liver tissue sampling were performed. RESULTS: The histopathology results showed that at high doses of olive leaf extract, the cells and vessels were regularly curable, and sinusoids were healthy. The expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) increased, and that of BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID )decreased. Enzymatic tests, including serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, showed a reduction in BID expression in the experimental group compared with the control group(P<0.005). CONCLUSION: We concluded that olive leaf extract boosts the BCL2 -an antiapoptotic gene-and reduces BID -an apoptosis gene-in the liver of chicken. It prevents the liver cells from disintegrating and destroys sinusoids and liver blood vessels. The high doses of the olive leaf extract caused liver resistance to CCL4 toxicity in chicken."

      "abstract": "Consumption of dietary bioactives is an avenue to enhancing the effective healthiness of diets by attenuating the glycaemic response. The intestinal brush border enzyme sucrase-isomaltase (SI) is the sole enzyme hydrolysing consumed sucrose, and we previously showed the acute effects of olive leaf extract (OLE) on sucrase activity when given together with sugars both in vitro and in vivo. Here we tested whether OLE could affect sucrase expression when pre-incubated chronically, a \"priming\" effect not dependent on competitive interaction with SI, in both a cell model and a human intervention. Using differentiated Caco-2/TC7 cells, long-term pre-treatment with oleuropein-rich olive leaf extract (OLE) lowered SI mRNA, surface protein and activity, and attenuated subsequent sucrose hydrolysis. Based on these results, a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study was conducted. OLE (50 mg oleuropein) was consumed in capsule form 3 times a day for 1 week by 11 healthy young women followed by an oral sucrose tolerance test in the absence of OLE. However this treatment, compared to placebo, did not induce a change in post-prandial blood glucose maximum concentration (Glcmax), time to reach Glcmax and incremental area under the curve. These results indicate that changes in SI mRNA, protein and activity in an intestinal cell model by OLE are not sufficient under these conditions to induce a functional effect in vivo in healthy volunteers.",

Female BALB/c adult mice were divided into four groups. Three days prior to oral treatments, tumors were transplanted. First group were treated with distilled water and other three groups were received, respectively, 75, 150, and 225 mg/kg/day of OLE for three weeks. For assessment of anti-angiogenesis and pro-apoptotic effect of OLE on tumor tissue, tumor volume, cell mitosis and apoptosis, and also vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin levels were assessed. OLE treatment with 150 and 225 mg/kg/day lead to significant reduction in tumor volume and cell mitosis compared with the control group, while the same doses significantly increase tumor cell apoptosis. OLE treatment with 150 mg/kg/day increase endostatin levels, while the same dose did not significantly decrease VEGF levels. The VEGF level is significantly reduced by the treatment with OLE 225 mg/kg/day for three weeks. Although, further studies are needed to clarify anti-angiogenesis and anti-apoptotic mechanism of OLE, consumption of OLE polyphenols after tumor transplantation reduced spontaneous mouse mammary tumor growth.",

Excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, involving interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8, from placental tissues is associated with pregnancy complications. Olive leaf extract has several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory functions. OleaVita is a new commercial olive leaf extract; it is hypothesized to suppress placental inflammation. In human placental tissue culture, OleaVita treatment inhibited the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB p65 protein expression. OleaVita also suppressed toll-like receptor ligands-induced IL-1β secretion in human placental tissues. IL-1β is regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasomes, a pivotal regulator of various diseases. OleaVita significantly decreased NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β protein expression, suggesting that it has an inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, OleaVita is beneficial as an inhibitor of inflammation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and may be used as a supplement for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases.",

Five diets were prepared for fed fish (mean body weight 15.90 ± 0.93 g) with different rates of OLE (0.0%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.50% and 1.0%). A control diet was prepared non-supplemented with OLE.

In conclusion, results of the present study show that feeding common carp with a diet containing 1 g/kg OLE over a period of 60 days might be adequate to improve fish immune parameters, and survival rate against E. tarda. Therefore, OLE can be used as a dietary additive to prevent E. tarda in common carp.",

The kidney is the major organ at risk of damage from chronic exposure to cadmium as a contaminant in food and water. This study aims to investigate the beneficial effects of OLE in renal collecting duct MCD4 cells exposed to a low dose cadmium (1 μM). In MCD4 cells cadmium caused an increase in ROS production, as well as generation of lipid droplets and reduced cell viability. Moreover, cadmium exposure led to a remarkable increase in the frequency of micronuclei and DNA double-strand breaks, assessed using the alkaline comet assay. In addition, cadmium dramatically altered cell cytoskeleton architecture and caused S-glutathionylation of actin. Notably, all cadmium-induced cellular deregulations were prevented by co-treatment with OLE, possibly due to its antioxidant action and to the presence of bioactive phytocompounds. Indeed, OLE treatment attenuated Cd-induced actin S-glutathionylation, thereby stabilizing actin filaments. Taken together, these observations provide a novel insight into the biological action of OLE in renal cells and support the notion that OLE may serve as a potential adjuvant against cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity.",

In this study we investigated whether an olive leaf extract (OLE), rich in polyphenols, was able to exert anti-tumor effects in human cervical cancer cells (HeLa). MTT assay results showed a reduction of HeLa cells viability OLE-induced, concomitantly with a gene and protein down-regulation of Cyclin-D1 and an up-regulation of p21, triggering intrinsic apoptosis. OLE reduced NFkB nuclear translocation, which constitutive activation, stimulated by HPV-oncoproteins, promotes cancer progression and functional studies revealed that OLE activated p21Cip/WAF1 in a transcriptional-dependent-manner, by reducing the nuclear recruitment of NFkB on its responsive elements. Furthermore, OLE treatment counteracted epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition and inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth EGF-induced. Finally, MTT assay results revealed that OLE plus Cisplatin strengthened the reduction of cells viability Cisplatin-induced, as OLE inhibited NFkB, AkT and MAPK pathways, all involved in Cisplatin chemoresistance. In conclusion, we demonstrated that in HeLa cells OLE exerts pro-apoptotic effects, elucidating the molecular mechanism and that OLE could mitigate Cisplatin chemoresistance. Further studies are needed to explore the potential coadiuvant use of OLE for cervical cancer treatment.",

Since the available treatment for ADPKD is limited, there is emerging interest for natural compounds as potential therapeutic candidates. The aim of our study was to investigate whether an olive leaf extract may be able to counteract the cyst growth in an in vitro model of ADPKD. We treated WT9-12 cells with an olive leaf extract (OLE). In monolayer culture we evaluated cell viability by the MTT assay, protein expression by western-blot analysis and apoptosis by DNA laddering and TUNEL assays. For functional studies we used transient transfection and ChIP assays. Intracellular calcium measurement was performed with a spectrofluorimeter using a fluorescent probe. 3D-cell-culture was used for cyst growth studies. OLE reduced the WT9-12 cell growth rate and affected intracellular signaling due to high c-AMP levels, as OLE reduced PKA levels, enhanced p-AKT, restored B-Raf-inactivation and down-regulated p-ERK. We elucidated the molecular mechanism by which OLE, via Sp1, transactivates the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter, whose levels are down-regulated by mutated PKD1. We demonstrated that p-AKT up-regulation also played a crucial role in the OLE-induced anti-apoptotic effect and that OLE ameliorated intracellular calcium levels, the primary cause of ADPKD. Finally, using a 3D-cell-culture model we observed that OLE reduced the cyst size. Therefore, multifaceted OLE may be considered a new therapeutic approach for ADPKD treatment.",

After 5 days of CDDP treatment, body and testicular weights, histopathological alteration, and serum male sex hormone levels were determined. In addition to the biochemical and immunohistochemical changes in the testes, CDDP caused the disorganization of germinal epithelium and apoptosis by inducing Bax and inhibiting Bcl-2 protein expression. Testicular weights, catalase, serum testosterone, testicular enzymatic (including glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase) along with nonenzymatic (glutathione) antioxidants, and levels of luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones were significantly reduced in addition to a significant increase in testicular malondialdehyde and nitrite/nitrate levels when compared with the control group. OLE treatment markedly attenuated both biochemical and histopathological changes. The reproductive beneficial effects of OLE were mediated, at least partly, by inducing the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway.",

Endoplasmic reticulum stress is involved in the pathology of myocardial infarction-mediated apoptosis. In the present study, myocardial cell line H9c2 cells were treated with cobalt chloride (CoCl2) to induce hypoxia. Isoproterenol was used for two successive days to induce myocardial infarction in SD rats. The cardioprotective effect of olive leaf extract (OLE) and its main constituent hydroxytyrosol and the underlying mechanisms were evaluated. The results showed that hydroxytyrosol markedly protected H9c2 cells against CoCl2-induced apoptosis. Hydroxytyrosol could reduce the mRNA and protein expression of GRP78 and CHOP induced by CoCl2 in vitro. In vivo, the decreased ejection fraction and fractional shortening, increased heart weight/body ratio, the formation of infarction, disordered cardiac muscle fibers and infiltration of inflammatory cells induced by isoproterenol could be significantly ameliorated by pretreatment with OLE for a month. Similarly, OLE could also reverse the increase of GRP78 and CHOP expression induced by isoproterenol. Therefore, OLE and hydroxytyrosol exert a cardioprotective effect through endoplasmic reticulum stress, which could be a new target for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases."

      "abstract": "Many studies reported that air pollution particulate matter (PM) exposure was associated with myocardial infarction (MI). Acrolein representing the unsaturated aldehydes, the main component of PM, derives from the incomplete combustion of wood, plastic, fossil fuels and the main constitute of cigarette smoking. However, the effect of acrolein on MI remains not that clear. In the current study, the effect of acrolein-exacerbated MI was investigated. In vivo, male Sprague-Dawley rats received olive leaf extract (OLE) followed by acrolein, then isoprenaline (ISO) was received by subcutaneous injection to induce MI. Results showed that the expression levels of GRP78 and CHOP, two major components of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were higher in the combination of acrolein and ISO than those in ISO treatment. The apoptosis marker, Bax, was also higher while the anti-apoptosis indicator, Bcl2 expression was lower both at protein and mRNA levels in the combination group. Also, the acrolein-protein adducts and myocardial pathological damage increased in the combination of acrolein and ISO relative to the ISO treatment. Besides, cardiac parameters, ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) were reduced more significantly when acrolein was added than in ISO treatment. Interestingly, all the changes were able to be ameliorated by OLE. Since hydroxytyrosol (HT) and oleuropein (OP) were the main components in OLE, we next investigated the effect of HT and OP on cardiomyocyte H9c2 cell apoptosis induced by acrolein through ER stress and Bax pathway. Results showed that GRP78, CHOP and Bax expression were upregulated, while Bcl2 expression was downregulated both at the protein and mRNA levels, when the H9c2 cells were treated with acrolein. In addition, pretreatment with HT can reverse the expression of GRP78, CHOP, Bax and Bcl2 on the protein and mRNA levels, while there was no effect of OP on the expression of GRP78 and CHOP on the mRNA levels. Overall, all these results demonstrated that OLE and the main components (HT and OP) could prevent the negative effects of acrolein on myocardium and cardiomyocytes.",

Therefore, olive leaf extract (OLE) is considered as a natural supplement. In this study we evaluated the antibacterial and the anti-inflammatory effect of OLE and its individual phenolic components in vitro. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNCs) were isolated from the whole blood using Histopaque solution and cultured in RPMI-enriched medium. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) level was determined by ELISA after 24 h of lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The antibacterial activity of OLE was determined by well diffusion assay. We found a significant decrease in TNFα secretion level in PMNCs culture treated with OLE. Oleuropein is the only OLE component that has shown anti-inflammatory effects at a concentration of 20 μg/mL. Furthermore, OLE exhibited antibacterial activity against some gram positive bacterial strains; however, gram negative bacterial strains were resistant to OLE. Downregulation of TNFα secretion in PMNCs culture in response to OLE treatment indicates that this polyphenol-rich extract has an anti-inflammatory effect, and oleuropein is the major OLE component responsible for this effect. The antibacterial activity of OLE is limited to gram positive bacteria.",

      "abstract": "Citrus fruit and olive leaves are a source of bioactive compounds such as biophenols which have been shown to ameliorate obesity-related conditions through their anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-inflammatory effect, and by regulating lipoproteins and cholesterol body levels. Citrolive™ is a commercial extract which is obtained from the combination of both citrus fruit and olive leaf extracts; hence, it is hypothesised that Citrolive™ may moderate metabolic disorders that are related to obesity and their complications. Initially, an in vitro study of the inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity was made, however, no effect was found. Both preliminary and long-term evaluations of Citrolive™ on lipid metabolism were conducted in an animal model using Wistar rats. In the preliminary in vivo screening, Citrolive™ was tested on postprandial plasma triglyceride level after the administration of an oil emulsion, and a significant reduction in postprandial triacylglycerol (TAG) levels was observed. In the long-term study, Citrolive™ was administered for 60 days on Wistar rats that were fed a high-fat diet. During the study, several associated lipid metabolism indicators were analysed in blood and faeces. At the end of the experiment, the livers were removed and weighed for group comparison. Citrolive™ treatment significantly reduced the liver-to-body-weight ratio, as supported by reduced plasma transaminases compared with control, but insignificantly reduced plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) and postprandial TAG plasma levels. In addition, faecal analysis showed that the treatment significantly increased total cholesterol excretion. On the other hand, no effect was found on faecal TAG and pancreatic lipase in vitro. In conclusion, treatment ameliorates liver inflammation symptoms that are worsened by the effects of high fat diet.",

Dry olive leaf extract (DOLE) is natural product with antioxidant and DNA protective properties. The effects of DOLE on the levels of DNA damage were investigated ex vivo in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of 19 workers occupationally exposed to lead (Pb), before and after CaNa2EDTA chelation therapy. DOLE demonstrated pronounced radical scavenging activity in concentrations ≥1 mg/mL, and showed no genotoxicity per se, in concentrations 0.125-1 mg/mL. The level of DNA damage in PBLs of workers before chelation therapy was elevated (24.21 ± 14.26) compared to controls (6.0 ± 3.37). The incubation of PBLs before chelation therapy with selected concentration of DOLE lead to a severe increase of DNA damage (64.03 ± 20.96), exhibiting prooxidant rather than antioxidant effect. After the five-day CaNa2EDTA chelation regimen, DNA damage in PBLs of workers decreased (8.26 ± 4.62) significantly compared to baseline. Treatment of PBLs with DOLE after chelation, again produced high level of damage (41.82 ± 23.17) and the acute prooxidant effects of DOLE remained, but, DNA damage was less severe than before chelation. The DOLE exhibits prooxidant effect in presence of Pb in lymphocytes of exposed workers, and its effect is less pronounced following the removal of Pb after standard chelation therapy.",

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the healing effects of olive leaf extract on 5-fluorouracil-induced OM in golden hamster. MATERIALS AND METHOD: OM was induced in 63 male golden hamsters by the combination of 5-fluorouracil injections (days 0, 5 and 10) and the abrasion of the cheek pouch (days 3 and 4). On day 12, hamsters were received topical olive leaf extract ointment, base of ointment, or no treatment (control) for 5 days. Histopathology evaluations, blood examinations, and tissue malondialdehyde level measurement were performed 1, 3 and 5 days after treatments. RESULTS: Histopathology score and tissue malondialdehyde level were significantly lower in olive leaf extract treated group in comparison with control and base groups (p= 0.000). Significant decreases in white blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit , and mean corpuscular volume and an increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were observed in olive leaf extract treated group in comparison with control and base groups (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that daily application of olive leaf extract ointment had healing effect on 5-fluorouracil induced OM in hamsters. Moreover, the beneficial effect of olive leaf extract on OM might be due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties."

Although recent literature has described a link between ailments such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer and a protective effect of polyphenols in the OLE, the mode of action is still unclear. Here, we describe a double-blinded placebo (PBO)-controlled trial, in which gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy male volunteers (n = 29) were analysed to identify genes that responded to OLE, following an eight-week intervention with 20 mL daily consumption of either OLE or PBO. Differences between groups were determined using an adjusted linear model. Subsequent analyses indicated downregulation of genes important in inflammatory pathways, lipid metabolism and cancer as a result of OLE consumption. Gene expression was verified by real-time PCR for three genes (EGR1, COX-2 and ID3). The results presented here suggest that OLE consumption may result in health benefits through influencing the expression of genes in inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Future studies with a larger study group, including male and female participants, looking into direct effects of OLE on lipid metabolism and inflammation are warranted.",

METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EBSCO host databases. Selected articles, with no date restriction in the search process, were assessed independently by the authors using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. Data from eight trials on 162 rats were reviewed. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 3.0. RESULTS: Combined random effects analysis revealed that treatment of diabetic rats with OLE significantly increased insulin levels (standardized mean difference [SMD] 4.83 μIU/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.13, 7.54) and reduced blood glucose levels (SMD -4.21 mg/dL; 95% CI -5.75, -2.67). Secondary outcomes included significant reductions in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, with a forest plot showing hypolipidemic effects among OLE-treated rats compared with placebo (SMD -6.32 mg/dL [95% CI -9.75, -2.88] and -4.22 mg/dL [95% CI -6.96, -1.48], respectively). There was no significant difference in body weight between OLE-treated rats and the placebo groups (SMD 0.46 g; 95% CI -0.05, 0.96; P  = 0.98). CONCLUSION: Olive leaf extract is beneficial for both the lipid profile and glycemic control in diabetes-induced rats and may be as effective among humans.",

      "abstract": "Olive leaves contain a wide variety of phenolic compounds belonging to phenolic acids, phenolic alcohols, flavonoids, and secoiridoids, and include also many other pharmacological active compounds. They could play an important role in human diet and health because of their ability to lower blood pressure, increase coronary arteries blood flow and decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of olive leaf extract (OLE) from Sicilian cultivar on adipogenic differentiation of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells and its impact on lipid metabolism. We showed that OLE treatment during adipogenic differentiation reduces inflammation, lipid accumulation and induces thermogenesis by activation of uncoupling protein uncoupling protein 1, sirtuin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, and coactivator 1 alpha. Furthermore, OLE significantly decreases the expression of molecules involved in adipogenesis and upregulates the expression of mediators involved in thermogenesis and lipid metabolism. Taken together, our results suggest that OLE may promote the brown remodeling of white adipose tissue inducing thermogenesis and improving metabolic homeostasis."

Patients were assigned to groups: the early phase RA group on MTX monotherapy (E MTX), and the two RA groups that received co-treatment with DOLE and MTX: early (E MTX + DOLE) and long-term phase patients (L-t MTX+ DOLE). Baseline values indicated increased parameters of cell damage and disruption of redox balance in all groups. After three weeks the E MTX + DOLE group maintained high catalase activity, exhibited decrease of lipid peroxidation and protein damage indicators-thiols and nitrites, while levels of DNA damage and pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 were significantly reduced. In E MTX group catalase activity remained unaltered while significant lipid peroxidation and DNA damage reductions were seen only after six weeks. L-t MTX + DOLE group showed only modest alterations of cell damage parameters during six weeks. Combined administration of DOLE with MTX contributes to faster reduction of cell damage, restores oxidative balance and improves interleukin-6 suppression during high disease activity in early phase RA, but not in long term patients.

      "abstract": "Malignant mesothelioma is a poor prognosis cancer in urgent need of alternative therapies. Oleuropein, the major phenolic of olive tree (Olea europaea L.), is believed to have therapeutic potentials for various diseases, including tumors. We obtained an oleuropein-enriched fraction, consisting of 60% w/w oleuropein, from olive leaves, and assessed its effects on intracellular Ca(2+) and cell viability in mesothelioma cells. Effects of the oleuropein-enriched fraction on Ca(2+) dynamics and cell viability were studied in the REN mesothelioma cell line, using fura-2 microspectrofluorimetry and MTT assay, respectively. Fura-2-loaded cells, transiently exposed to the oleuropein-enriched fraction, showed dose-dependent transient elevations of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). Application of standard oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, and of the inhibitor of low-voltage T-type Ca(2+) channels NNC-55-0396, suggested that the effect is mainly due to oleuropein acting through its hydroxytyrosol moiety on T-type Ca(2+) channels. The oleuropein-enriched fraction and standard oleuropein displayed a significant antiproliferative effect, as measured on REN cells by MTT cell viability assay, with IC50 of 22 μg/mL oleuropein. Data suggest that our oleuropein-enriched fraction from olive leaf extract could have pharmacological application in malignant mesothelioma anticancer therapy, possibly by targeting T-type Ca(2+) channels and thereby dysregulating intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics."

Ten Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and twenty SHR were randomly assigned to three groups: a control WKY group, a control SHR group and a SHR group treated with OLE (30 mg kg(-1)) for 5 weeks. Long-term administration of OLE reduced systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac and renal hypertrophy. OLE treatment reversed the impaired aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine observed in SHR. OLE restored aortic eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177 and Thr-495 and increased eNOS activity. OLE eliminated the increased aortic superoxide levels, and reduced the elevated NADPH oxidase activity, as a result of reduced NOX-1 and NOX-2 mRNA levels in SHR. OLE reduced the enhanced vascular TLR4 expression by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling with the subsequent reduction of proinflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, OLE exerts antihypertensive effects on genetic hypertension related to the improvement of vascular function as a result of reduced pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory status.",

METHODS: Male wistar rats age 4 and 18 months were randomized into control and experimental groups. A single daily dose of 50 mg/kg of olive leaf extract was administered orally by gavage to each rat for 6 months. The control group received only distilled water. All rats were sacrificed 2 hours after the last gavage and their midbrains were separated for Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzyme activitiy analysis. TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were used for evaluation of the number of neurons in the Substantia Nigra. RESULTS: The level of Catalase, Glutathione Peroxidase and Superoxide Dismutase enzyme activity were significantly increased in experimental young and old groups compared to their control groups. However the level of Superoxide Dismutase enzyme activity was significantly increased in experimental old group when compared to control group (P< 0.05), the level of Superoxide Dismutase enzyme activity was not significantly changed in young groups. MDA level was decreased significantly in experimental young and old rats compared to their control groups. Histological analysis demonstrated that the number of neurons in Substantia Nigra of experimental old group was more than the control group (P<0.05). The number of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased in experimental old group compared to the corresponding control group (P<0.05). In IHC and TUNEL assay, no change was observed in the number of neurons between experimental and control young groups. CONCLUSION: Long term treatment with olive leaf extract increases antioxidant enzyme activity and protects the neurons in Substantia Nigra against oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Olive leaves are traditionally used in the Mediterranean basin in many medical conditions for its potent antioxidant activity. Cyclosporine A, a well-known immunosuppressant, can induce nephrotoxicity through oxidative stress. This study investigated the effect of olive leaf extract (OLE) on cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty Wistar rats (180 g to 200 g) were classified into 5 groups, each containing 6 rats. The first group received normal saline and served as control. The second group was treated with cyclosporine, 25 mg/kg for 21 days for nephrotoxicity induction. Groups 3 to 5 were treated with cyclosporine, 25 mg/kg in addition to different doses of OLE (40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, and 120 mg/kg), respectively, for 21 days. After 21 days, the rats' body weights were recorded and the rats were sacrificed. Blood samples were collected and the animals were necropsied. Both kidneys were removed, one for histopathological and one for antioxidant activity evaluations. RESULTS: Cyclosporine significantly reduced body weight and kidney weight; serum total protein, albumin, and sodium levels; and renal glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. It also increased serum urea, creatinine, and calcium levels as compared to the control group. Groups 4 and 5 showed a significantly greater body weight and kidney weight; higher serum sodium, total protein, and albumin levels; greater glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase; and lower serum urea, creatinine, and calcium levels as compared to group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with OLE can alleviate cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity when used in a proper dose.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Oleuropein (OP), the predominant natural constituent of leaves of the olive tree, exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The purpose of this study was to assess the protective effects of OP under the conditions of paraquat (PQ)-induced oxidative stress in vitro, using the human hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2. METHODS: Cell viability and death were determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-propidium iodide staining, respectively. Superoxide anion and lipid peroxidation levels were evaluated using nitroblue tetrazolium and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assays, respectively. Apoptosis was assessed by measuring poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 (Casp-3) cleavage via immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses. RESULTS: PQ induced a decrease in cellular viability by promoting necrosis through a mechanism involving superoxide generation and nuclear translocation of cleaved Casp-3. Co-treatment with OP afforded significant protection against the suppressive effects of PQ, as evident from increased cell viability, reduction of Casp-3 immunofluorescence, and normalization of β-tubulin expression levels. Unexpectedly, these OP-mediated protective effects were associated with increased superoxide and malondialdehyde generation and PARP cleavage. DISCUSSION: OP protects HepG2 cells against PQ-induced necrosis by suppressing Casp-3 cleavage while concomitantly acting as a pro-oxidant agent. This paradoxical mechanism of action of OP requires further investigation.",

Such polyphenols have been demonstrated to favourably modify a variety of cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of the present intervention was to investigate the influence of olive leaf extract (OLE) on vascular function and inflammation in a postprandial setting and to link physiological outcomes with absorbed phenolics. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, acute intervention trial was conducted with eighteen healthy volunteers (nine male, nine female), who consumed either OLE (51 mg oleuropein; 10 mg HT), or a matched control (separated by a 4-week wash out) on a single occasion. Vascular function was measured by digital volume pulse (DVP), while blood collected at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 h was cultured for 24 h in the presence of lipopolysaccharide in order to investigate effects on cytokine production. Urine was analysed for phenolic metabolites by HPLC. DVP-stiffness index and ex vivo IL-8 production were significantly reduced (P< 0.05) after consumption of OLE compared to the control. These effects were accompanied by the excretion of several phenolic metabolites, namely HT and oleuropein derivatives, which peaked in urine after 8-24 h. The present study provides the first evidence that OLE positively modulates vascular function and IL-8 production in vivo, adding to growing evidence that olive phenolics could be beneficial for health.",

DOX (30mg/kg; i.p.) was administered to rats, which were sacrificed 4 days after DOX. The rats received OLE (6 and 12mL/L in drinking water) for 12 days. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, urea and creatinine levels, as well as prooxidant and antioxidant status in organs were measured. DOX was found to increase serum markers that indicate tissue injury, malondialdehyde (MDA), diene conjugate (DC), and protein carbonyl (PC) levels, and to decrease glutathione (GSH) levels in organs. Histopathologic changes were also evaluated. OLE, especially OLE 1000, led to decreases in serum cTnI and urea levels, ALT and AST activities, and amelioration in histopathologic findings. Decreases in MDA, DC, and PC, and increases in GSH levels were observed in organs of DOX-treated rats due to OLE. We conclude that OLE treatment may be effective in decreasing DOX-induced cardiac, hepatic and renal oxidative stress and injury."

      "abstract": "A new differential metabolomic approach has been developed to identify the phenolic cellular metabolites derived from breast cancer cells treated with a supercritical fluid extracted (SFE) olive leaf extract. The SFE extract was previously shown to have significant antiproliferative activity relative to several other olive leaf extracts examined in the same model. Upon SFE extract incubation of JIMT-1 human breast cancer cells, major metabolites were identified by using HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS). After treatment, diosmetin was the most abundant intracellular metabolite, and it was accompanied by minor quantities of apigenin and luteolin. To identify the putative antiproliferative mechanism, the major metabolites and the complete extract were assayed for cell cycle, MAPK and PI3K proliferation pathways modulation. Incubation with only luteolin showed a significant effect in cell survival. Luteolin induced apoptosis, whereas the whole olive leaf extract incubation led to a significant cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The antiproliferative activity of both pure luteolin and olive leaf extract was mediated by the inactivation of the MAPK-proliferation pathway at the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2). However, the flavone concentration of the olive leaf extract did not fully explain the strong antiproliferative activity of the extract. Therefore, the effects of other compounds in the extract, probably at the membrane level, must be considered. The potential synergistic effects of the extract also deserve further attention. Our differential metabolomics approach identified the putative intracellular metabolites from a botanical extract that have antiproliferative effects, and this metabolomics approach can be expanded to other herbal extracts or pharmacological complex mixtures.",

As oxidative stress plays an important role in aging, we investigated the effect of OLE on oxidative stress in the liver, heart and brain of aged rats. METHODS: Young (age 3 months) and aged (age 20 months) Wistar rats were used. Aged rats received OLE (500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 2 months. Malondialdehyde (MDA), diene conjugate (DC), protein carbonyl (PC), glutathione (GSH), vitamin E and vitamin C levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities were determined. RESULTS: MDA, DC and PC levels increased in tissues of aged rats. GSH levels decreased in the liver, but not in the heart and brain. There was no change of other anti-oxidant parameters in tissues. Hepatic SOD and GSH-Px protein expressions also remained unchanged. OLE treatment caused decreased tissue MDA, DC and PC levels, and increased hepatic GSH levels in aged rats. Other anti-oxidant parameters, hepatic SOD and GSH-Px protein expressions did not alter in aged rats by OLE treatment. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that OLE seems to be useful for decreasing oxidative stress in examined tissues by acting as an anti-oxidant itself without affecting the anti-oxidant system.",

Phenolic-rich plant product dry olive leaf extract (DOLE) is known to modulate effects of various oxidants in human cells. The aim was to evaluate the effect of commercial DOLE against adrenaline induced DNA damage in human leukocytes by using comet assay. Peripheral blood leukocytes from 6 healthy subjects were treated in vitro with three final concentrations of DOLE (0.125, 0.5, and 1mg/mL) for 30 min at 37°C under two different protocols, pretreatment and post-treatment. Protective effect of DOLE was assessed from its ability to attenuate formation of DNA lesions induced by adrenaline. Compared to cells exposed only to adrenaline, DOLE displayed significant reduction (P<0.001) of DNA damage at all three concentrations and under both experimental protocols. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive association between DOLE concentration and leukocytes DNA damage (P<0.05). Antigenotoxic effect of the extract was more pronounced at smaller concentrations. Post-treatment with 0.125 mg/mL DOLE was the most effective against adrenaline genotoxicity. Results indicate genoprotective and antioxidant properties in dry olive leaf extract, strongly supporting further explorations of its underlying mechanisms of action.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study utilized a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, and cross-over design. Twenty-five patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive a mouth wash containing OLE, benzydamine hydrochloride, or placebo in 3 different cycles of chemotherapy. Oral mucositis severity was assessed using the World Health Organization criteria and Oral Mycositis Assessment Scale. Patients were evaluated weekly until 15 days after chemotherapy for each cycle. Salivary levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. RESULTS: Oral mucositis rates and severity after 2 weeks were significantly lower in the OLE and benzydamine groups compared to the placebo group. The IL-1β and TNF-α levels were significantly decreased in the OLE group compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: Preliminary findings indicate that OLE is effective in reducing IL-1β and TNF-α levels after chemotherapy and exert a therapeutic effect and prevent development of severe oral mucositis."

First and second groups (control, and sham) received distilled water, while three treatment groups received oral olive leaf extract (OLE) for 30 days (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively). Two hours after the last dose, each main group was subdivided to Middle cerebral artery occlusion-operated and intact subgroup for assessment of neuropathology (neurologic deficit scores and infarct volume), brain lipid analysis and brain glutathione levels, respectively. RESULTS: OLE increased the brain cholesterol ester, cholesterol, cerebroside and phosphatidylcholine levels in doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day. OLE increased the brain triglyceride levels in doses of 75 and 100 mg/kg/day and OLE reduced the brain ceramide levels in doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day in comparison to the control group (p<0.05).

They contain several potentially bioactive compounds that may have hypoglycemic properties. To examine the efficacy of 500 mg oral olive leaf extract taken once daily in tablet form versus matching placebo in improving glucose homeostasis in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In this controlled clinical trial, 79 adults with T2DM were randomized to treatment with 500 mg olive leaf extract tablet taken orally once daily or matching placebo. The study duration was 14 weeks. Measures of glucose homeostasis including Hba1c and plasma insulin were measured and compared by treatment assignment. In a series of animal models, normal, streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic, and sand rats were used in the inverted sac model to determine the mechanism through which olive leaf extract affected starch digestion and absorption. In the randomized clinical trial, the subjects treated with olive leaf extract exhibited significantly lower HbA1c and fasting plasma insulin levels; however, postprandial plasma insulin levels did not differ significantly by treatment group. In the animal models, normal and STZ diabetic rats exhibited significantly reduced starch digestion and absorption after treatment with olive leaf extract compared with intestine without olive leaf treatment. Reduced digestion and absorption was observed in both the mucosal and serosal sides of the intestine. Though reduced, the decline in starch digestion and absorption did not reach statistical significance in the sand rats. Olive leaf extract is associated with improved glucose homeostasis in humans. Animal models indicate that this may be facilitated through the reduction of starch digestion and absorption. Olive leaf extract may represent an effective adjunct therapy that normalizes glucose homeostasis in individuals with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Permethrin is a common synthetic chemical, widely used as an insecticide in agriculture and other domestic applications. The previous reports indicated that permethrin is a highly toxic synthetic pyrethroid pesticide to human and environmental health. Therefore, the present experiment was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of olive leaf extract in modulating the permethrin induced genotoxic and oxidative damage in rats. The animals used were broadly divided into four (A, B, C and D) experimental groups. Group A rats served as control animals and received distilled water intraperitoneally (n = 5). Groups B and C rats received intraperitoneal injections of permethrin (60 mg kg(-1) b.w) and olive leaf extract (500 mg kg(-1) b.w), respectively. Group D rats received permethrin (60 mg kg(-1) b.w) plus olive leaf extract (500 mg kg(-1) b.w). Rats were orally administered their respective feed daily for 21 days. At the end of the experiment rats were anesthetized and serum and bone marrow cell samples were obtained. Genotoxic damage was assessed by micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays. Total antioxidant capacity and total oxidant status were also measured in serum samples to assess oxidative status. Treatment of Group B with permethrin resulted in genotoxic damage and increased total oxidant status levels. Permethrin treatment also significantly decreased (P < 0.05) total antioxidant capacity level when compared to Group A rats. Group C rats showed significant increases (P < 0.05) in total antioxidant capacity level and no alterations in cytogenetic parameters. Moreover, simultaneous treatments with olive leaf extract significantly modulated the toxic effects of permethrin in Group D rats. It can be concluded that olive leaf extract has beneficial influences and could be able to antagonize permethrin toxicity. As a result, this investigation clearly revealed the protective role of olive leaf extract against the genetic and oxidative damage by permethrin in vivo for the first time."

This study investigated the effect of OLE on the development of kaolin and carrageenan-induced arthritis, a murine model of OA. Administration of OLE significantly ameliorated paw swelling, the paw Evans blue content and the histopathological scores. In the human monocyte cell line, THP-1, the OLE reduced the LPS-induced TNF-α production and was dose dependent. Croton oil-induced ear edema in mice also revealed that treatment with OLE suppressed ear edema, myeloperoxidase (MPO) production and was dose dependent. These results indicated that OLE is an effective antiarthritis agent through an antiinflammation mechanism. Also OLE may be beneficial for the treatment of OA in humans.",

      "abstract": "Virtually ever since it was first commercialized in 1995, there have been several studies focusing on the use of olive leaf extract (OLE) as a natural therapy and its medical properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three different concentrations of OLE on the function of mice livers over the course of 14 weeks. Female ICR mice were divided into four groups, depending on OLE concentration used: 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 0.75%. Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and albumin serum concentrations were all measured. Histopathological changes of the liver were observed after haematoxylin and eosin, reticulin, and Masson's trichrome staining was carried out while liver mitochondrial bioenergetics were also evaluated. Alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase serum enzyme activities increased significantly in the groups in which 0.5% and 0.75% OLE concentrations were used. Histologically, all the groups exposed to OLE exhibited hyperplasia of the bile ducts, cholestasis, hepatocyte necrosis and inflammatory infiltrated. Hepatic fibrosis was observed in the groups featuring 0.5% and 0.75% OLE concentrations. The mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory control ratio and ADP/O of samples from animals fed the higher OLE concentration was significantly decreased when compared to the control group.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that olive extracts suppress inflammation and reduce stress oxidative injury. We sought to extend these observations in an in vivo study of rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Four groups, each of 18 Wister rats, were studied. One (control) group received distilled water, while three treatment groups received oral olive leaf extract (50, 75 and 100mg/kg/day respectively). After 30 days, blood lipid profiles were determined, before a 60 min period of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). After 24h reperfusion, neurological deficit scores, infarct volume, brain edema, and blood-brain barrier permeability were each assessed in subgroups of six animals drawn from each main group. Olive leaf extract reduced the LDL/HDL ratio in doses 50, 75, and 100mg/kg/day in comparison to the control group (P<0.001), and offered cerebroprotection from ischemia-reperfusion. For controls vs. doses of 50mg/kg/day vs. 75 mg/kg/day vs. 100mg/kg/day, attenuated corrected infarct volumes were 209.79 ± 33.05 mm(3) vs. 164.36 ± 13.44 mm(3) vs. 123.06 ± 28.83 mm(3) vs. 94.71 ± 33.03 mm(3); brain water content of the infarcted hemisphere 82.33 ± 0.33% vs. 81.33 ± 0.66% vs. 80.75 ± 0.6% vs. 80.16 ± 0.47%, and blood-brain barrier permeability of the infarcted hemisphere 11.22 ± 2.19 μg/g vs. 9.56 ± 1.74 μg/g vs. 6.99 ± 1.48 μg/g vs. 5.94 ± 1.73 μg/g tissue (P<0.05 and P<0.01 for measures in doses 75 and 100mg/kg/day vs. controls respectively). Oral administration of olive leaf extract reduces infarct volume, brain edema, blood-brain barrier permeability, and improves neurologic deficit scores after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.",

      "abstract": "Various constituents of the olive tree (Olea europaea) have been traditionally used in the treatment of infection, inflammation, prevention of chronic diseases, cardiovascular disorders and cancer. The anticancer potential of dry olive leaf extract (DOLE) represents the net effect of multilevel interactions between different biologically active compounds from the extract, cancer cells and conventional therapy. In this context, it was of primary interest to evaluate the influence of DOLE on progression of the highly malignant, immuno- and chemoresistant type of skin cancer-melanoma. DOLE significantly inhibited proliferation and subsequently restricted clonogenicity of the B16 mouse melanoma cell line in vitro. Moreover, late phase tumor treatment with DOLE significantly reduced tumor volume in a syngeneic strain of mice. DOLE-treated B16 cells were blocked in the G(0) /G(1) phase of the cell cycle, underwent early apoptosis and died by late necrosis. At the molecular level, the dying process started as caspase dependent, but finalized as caspase independent. In concordance, overexpression of antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and diminished expression of their natural antagonists, Bim and p53, were observed. Despite molecular suppression of the proapoptotic process, DOLE successfully promoted cell death mainly through disruption of cell membrane integrity and late caspase-independent fragmentation of genetic material. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that DOLE possesses strong antimelanoma potential. When DOLE was applied in combination with different chemotherapeutics, various outcomes, including synergy and antagonism, were observed. This requires caution in the use of the extract as a supplementary antitumor therapeutic.",
