      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by dopaminergic neuronal loss and chronic neuroinflammation, leading to significant motor and non-motor deficits. This study explores the therapeutic potential of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine model of PD. Male Balb-C mice were divided into control, LPS-treated, LPS + ALA-treated and ALA-only groups. Behavioural assessments, including the pole test, rotarod test and open field test, revealed significant motor impairments in LPS-treated mice. Co-treatment with ALA partially ameliorated motor deficits in LPS-treated mice compared to the healthy control group. However, no direct comparison was made with standard PD treatments such as levodopa. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a 68% reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of LPS-treated mice. Notably, ALA co-treatment preserved dopaminergic neurons, demonstrating its neuroprotective effects. Western blotting and ELISA revealed heightened expression of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-1β and NF-κB, in LPS-treated mice. ALA treatment significantly reduced these markers, indicating its capacity to mitigate neuroinflammation. Molecular docking analysis revealed moderate binding affinities of ALA to NF-κB (-5.1 kcal/mol), TNF-α (-5.7 kcal/mol) and IL-1β (-3.9 kcal/mol), suggesting possible interactions with key inflammatory pathways. These interactions were comparable to known inhibitors, indicating ALA's potential for neuroprotection. This study highlights the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of ALA in reducing dopaminergic neuronal loss and mitigating neuroinflammation in an LPS-induced PD model. Although behavioural improvements were moderate, these findings underscore ALA's potential as an adjunct therapeutic candidate for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is warranted to explore its translational applications in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Behavioural reactivity in horses poses a welfare and safety risk to both the horse and the handler, however, beneficial effects have been observed when dietary fat is increased in replacement of sugar. Supplementation with the fatty acids (FA) eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) appear to improve negative behaviours in rodents and humans, but the effect of α-linolenic acid (ALA), EPA, and DHA, specifically, on reactivity in horses is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of camelina oil (CAM; ALA-enriched) and a mix of camelina and algal oil (ALG; ALA-, EPA-, and DHA-enriched) both fed at a dose of 0.37 g oil/kg body weight on plasma FA, behaviour, and heart rate variability (HRV) in young horses compared to a negative control (CON). Thirty-four client-owned horses aged 7 months - 6 years were enrolled. Horses were assigned to either CAM, ALG, or CON and underwent a novel object test (NOT) before and after a 6-week supplementation period. Prior to each NOT, blood was collected for evaluation of plasma FA profile (n = 28). During the NOT, behaviour was recorded using a pre-determined ethogram and assessed in BORIS software by two raters (n = 29). Electrocardiogram (ECG) data was collected at baseline, during the NOT, and after the NOT (recovery). The ECG data was analyzed in Kubios software for determination of heart rate (HR) and several HRV parameters (n = 24). The treatment oils were treated as fixed effects, baseline measurements as covariates, and location as a random effect. Plasma DHA (P < 0.01) was greater and n-6:n-3 ratio (P < 0.01) was reduced in ALG than in CAM and CON, while ALA and EPA were similar among treatments (P > 0.05). When treatments were pooled, the maximum HR (P < 0.01) and the low frequency to high frequency ratio HRV parameter (P < 0.01) were greater during the NOT compared to baseline and recovery. Bucking (P = 0.03) and backing (P = 0.02) behaviours were reduced in the CAM group compared to the CON group, but neither group differed from ALG. All other behaviours, HR, and HRV parameters were similar among treatments (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that the NOT was successful in creating acute stress, however, feeding either CAM or ALG at this dose did not reduce reactivity in this cohort of horses. Further research is needed to understand the effects of specific FA, if any, on behaviour and HRV in more specific populations of horses and specifically those deemed highly reactive."

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and L-carnitine co-supplementation on migraine symptoms, mental health, and life quality in women with migraine. METHODS: In this randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with migraine were randomly assigned to receive either ALA (1000 mg) plus L-carnitine (500 mg) or matching placebos daily for 12 weeks. Migraine characteristics, mental health parameters, and quality of life measures were assessed at baseline and study end. RESULTS: The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in migraine frequency (-2.96; 95% CI (-3.48, -2.45) vs -0.07; 95% CI (-0.68, 0.53), P < 0.001), severity (-1.6; 95% CI (-2.05, -1.15) vs - 0.44; 95% CI (-0.91, 0.02), P = 0.001), and duration (-4.9; 95% CI (-6.34, -3.45) vs -0.5; 95% CI (-1.06, 0.66) hours, P < 0.001) compared to the placebo group. Mental health improvements were observed in depression (-7.4; 95% CI (-9.24, -5.55) vs 0.05; 95% CI (-1.16, 1.26), P < 0.001), and anxiety scores (-5.7; 95% CI (-7.26, -4.14) vs - 0.65; 95% CI (-2.33, 1.03), P < 0.001). Quality of life measures showed significant enhancement, with increased migraine-specific quality of life (9.75; 95% CI (8.01, 11.49) vs 1.22; 95% CI (-0.66, 3.11), P < 0.001) and decreased headache impact test-6 scores (-8.57; 95% CI (-11.79, -5.36) vs -1.35; 95% CI (-3.41, 0.71), P = 0.005) in the intervention group compared to the controls. CONCLUSION: Co-supplementation with ALA and L-carnitine may offer a promising adjuvant therapy for managing migraine in women, addressing both physical symptoms and psychological burdens.

      "abstract": "Camelina sativa is an oilseed crop rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA), an n-3 fatty acid (FA), and is resistant to harsh climates and pests. Previously, supplementation with camelina oil (CAM) in horses had no adverse effects on basic health parameters and had comparable skin and coat parameters as both flaxseed oil (FLX) and canola oil (OLA). Further, the plasma FA profile of horses was reflective of their respective treatment oil. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of dietary CAM supplementation on skin FA profile, immune, and inflammatory responses as compared to 2 commonly used oils in the equine industry, OLA and FLX, in healthy adult horses. Twenty-four adult horses, from 2 separate herds, were enrolled in this experiment. The horses underwent a gradual 4-wk fat acclimation period to sunflower oil (approximately 0.28% ALA), then were supplemented with either CAM (approximately 34.9% ALA), OLA (approximately 12.0% ALA), or FLX (56.0% ALA) at an inclusion rate of 0.37 g/kg body weight (BW) per day for an additional 16 wk. Immune and inflammatory responses were assessed by measuring antibody concentrations across time after sensitization to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) at weeks 10 and 12, and a subsequent delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) challenge. Skin biopsy samples were collected at weeks 0, 8, and 16, and FA composition was determined using gas-chromatography. All data were analyzed as a repeated measures ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. Antibody and DTH responses to KLH did not differ among groups (P = 0.262 and 0.813, respectively), and no treatment by time effects were observed (P = 0.764 and P = 0.817, respectively). Most FA in the skin changed in composition across time, with the sum of n-3 FA increasing (P < 0.001) and the sum of n-6 FA and skin n-6:n-3 ratio decreasing over time (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Only dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (P = 0.025) and the sum of n-3 FA (P = 0.031) had treatment-by-week effects. At week 16, the composition of eicosapentaenoic acid in the skin was greater in FLX than OLA, but neither differed from CAM (P = 0.049). These results suggest that ALA supplementation may beneficially impact skin FA profile. However, due to the small differences in n-3 FA and n-6:n-3 ratio among CAM, FLX, and OLA, a comparable skin FA profile, immune, and inflammatory response was observed among treatments at a dose of 0.37 g oil/kg BW. Therefore, CAM may be a suitable alternative to FLX in equine diets for the delivery of ALA.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite progress in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment, challenges persist in medication adherence due to side effects and costs. Precision nutrition, particularly adjusting fatty acid intake, offers a cost-effective strategy for enhancing SLE management. Prior research, including our own, indicates that increased consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) correlates with improved outcomes in SLE patients. Here we build upon these findings by investigating associations between serum fatty acids-grouped as PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and saturated fatty acids (SFAs)-and lupus activity, pain, and sleep disturbance. METHODS: Using data from 418 participants with SLE in the Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance (MILES) Cohort, we examined associations between serum levels of 25 fatty acids determined by GC-MS and patient-reported outcomes. Disease activity, pain, and sleep quality were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Generalized additive models and partial residual plots were utilized to examine the linearity of fatty acid effects. Variable selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), followed by multiple linear regression adjusting for sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: Findings indicated favorable associations between ω-3 PUFAs-and, to a lesser extent, ω-6 PUFAs-and patient-reported outcomes, while MUFAs and SFAs showed unfavorable associations. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 PUFA, exhibited the most robust favorable associations across all outcomes. Additionally, the omega-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA) was linked to reduced pain, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), another omega-3, was associated with worsened disease activity and pain. Among omega-6 PUFAs, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA) was favorably associated with disease activity, while the omega-9 PUFA Mead acid was linked to increased pain. DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the prospect that increased tissue levels of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA, are favorably associated with SLE outcomes. Although further research is needed to establish causal relationships, existing evidence supports the role of omega-3 PUFAs in managing cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease, common SLE comorbidities. Most study participants exhibited low omega-3 PUFA status, suggesting substantial potential for improvement through targeted dietary interventions and supplementation. This study supports a potential role for precision nutrition in comprehensive SLE management, considering the impact of PUFAs, SFAs and MUFAs.",

(chia) seed, rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA), was able to reduce visceral adiposity and improves insulin sensitivity in a rodent experimental model of adiposity induced by the administration of a sucrose-rich diet (SRD). The evidence suggests that the pathological expansion of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is accompanied by changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which can lead to fibrosis, and/or a greater expression of pro-inflammatory adipokines. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of chia seed administration upon key components and modulators of ECM remodeling and inflammation in different white adipose tissues (WAT) (epididymal-eWAT- and retroperitoneal-rWAT-) in a SRD-induced adiposity rodent model. The results showed that chia seed reduced the increased hydroxyproline levels observed in SRD-fed group and this was accompanied by changes in the activity/expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. No changes were observed in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) expression levels. In addition, this nutritional intervention was able to reduce the levels of PAI-1 and MCP-1, and to increase the levels of adiponectin in both VAT. An increase in the ratio of n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the membrane phospholipids of both VAT was also observed. The present study demonstrated that chia seed have anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory actions in the VAT which could play a key role in the amelioration of visceral adiposity and whole-body insulin insensitivity developed in SRD-fed rats.",

Data were collected from a variety of studies: randomized intervention trials, observational and interventional studies, case reports, and epidemiological studies. The evidence suggests that PUFAs are beneficial for mental health, brain function, and behavior. ALA, EPA, and DHA have very significant neuroprotective properties, particularly in inducing changes to the synaptic membrane and modulating brain cell signaling. In the case of neurodegenerative disorders, PUFAs incorporated into cellular membranes have been shown to protect against cell atrophy and death. The formal analyses of the included studies pointed to a decrease in ALA, EPA, and DHA levels in various populations (e.g., children, adolescents, adults, and seniors) presenting with different types of mental disorders. These results indicate that PUFA supplementation may be considered as an innovative therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of neuronal degeneration.",

      "abstract": "Salmonella is a major foodborne pathogen that can be transmitted from livestock and poultry to humans through the food chain. Due to the widespread use of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance Salmonella has become an important factor threatening food safety. Combining antibiotic and non-antibiotic agents is a promising approach to address the widespread emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In this study, we investigated the antibiotic resistance profile and molecular characterization of different serotypes of Salmonella isolated from large-scale egg farms using drug susceptibility testing and whole genome sequencing. The synergistic effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) with antibiotics was evaluated using the checkerboard test and time-kill curve. The molecular mechanism of α-linolenic acid synergism was explored using biochemical assays, pull-down assays, and molecular docking. In vivo efficacy of ALA in combination with florfenicol (FFC) or tetracycline (TET) against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium was also investigated using a mouse model. We found that ALA reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tetracycline and florfenicol in all strains tested. When ALA (512 mg/L) was combined with florfenicol (32 mg/L) or tetracycline (16 mg/L), we observed disruption of cell membrane integrity, increased outer membrane permeability, lowered cell membrane potential, and inhibition of proton-drive-dependent efflux pumps. The synergistic treatment also inhibited biofilm production and promoted oxidative damage. These changes together led to an increase in bacterial antibiotic susceptibility. The improved efficacy of ALA combination treatment with antibiotics was validated in the mouse model. Molecular docking results indicate that ALA can bind to membrane proteins via hydrogen bonding. Our findings demonstrated that combined treatment using ALA and antibiotics is effective in preventing infections involving MDR bacteria. Our results are of great significance for the scientific and effective prevention and control of antibiotic resistance Salmonella, as well as ensuring food safety.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phosphatidylserine (PS) and α-Linolenic acid (ALA), are positively associated with cognitive function, but their combination effects and possible mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to explore the effects on cognition and potential mechanism of the supplements. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited 190 MCI patients in Tianjin, China, and randomly assigned in intervention group and placebo group. Each group consumed two capsules every day for 12 months. Each capsule for intervention group contains 144 mg ALA, 31.5 mg PS and 3.6 mg Ginkgo total flavonoids as main functional components, with 0.48 mg Vitamin B1 (as thiamine hydrochloride), 0.48 mg Vitamin B6 (as pyridoxine hydrochloride) and 90 μg folic acid as supplement. Capsules for placebo group were identical but contain no active ingredients. Cognitive function, serum n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and neurotransmitters were assessed at baseline and 12 months. Linear mixed effects model and causal mediation analysis were conducted to explore the effects and potential mechanism of the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 190 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.95 [5.62] years; 70 (36.8 %) male and 120 (63.2 %) female) were randomized to the placebo group (n = 95) and intervention group (n = 95). Compared with placebo group, the intervention group had statistically significant improvements in arithmetic testing (β, 0.688; 95 % CI, 0.103-1.274), the similarity test (β, 1.070; 95 % CI, 0.472-1.667) and short-term memory (β, 0.600; 95 % CI, 0.399-0.800). Besides, the intervention group had statistically significant increases in serum ALA (β, 1.620; 95 % CI, 0.967-2.265), DHA (β, 2.797; 95 % CI, 1.075-4.532), EPA (β, 1.472; 95 % CI, 0.296-2.643), acetylcholine (β, 0.441; 95 % CI, 0.415-0.468), GABA (β, 0.009; 95 % CI, 0.001-0.016) and 5-HT (β, 0.160; 95 % CI, 0.081-0.238) compared to the placebo group. And the intervention may improve short-term memory by increasing serum ALA levels (average causal mediation effect = 0.132, 95 % CI, 0.053-0.225) with 19.7 % mediation proportion. CONCLUSIONS: This food supplement containing phosphatidylserine could improve different cognitive functions of MCI patients, especially short-term memory, and increase serum n-3 PUFAs and neurotransmitters levels. Serum ALA level might play a mediation role.",

The neuroprotective role of walnut oil (WO) was investigated in Drosophila melanogaster treated with rotenone (Rot), as a PD model, WO, or their combination, and compared to controls. WO reduced mortality and improved locomotor activity impairment after 3 and 7 days, induced by Rot. LC-MS analyses of fatty acid levels in Drosophila heads showed a significant increase in linolenic (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) both in flies fed with the WO-enriched diet and in those treated with the association of WO with Rot. Flies supplemented with the WO diet showed an increase in brain dopamine (DA) level, while Rot treatment significantly depleted dopamine content; conversely, the association of Rot with WO did not modify DA content compared to controls. The greater intake of ALA and LA in the enriched diet enhanced their levels in Drosophila brain, suggesting a neuroprotective role of polyunsaturated fatty acids against Rot-induced neurotoxicity. The involvement of the dopaminergic system in the improvement of behavioral and biochemical parameters in Drosophila fed with WO is also suggested.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder that is poorly treated by current therapies. Emerging evidence indicates that SCZ is closely correlated with a persistent neuroinflammation. α-linolenic acid (ALA) is highly concentrated in the brain and represents a modulator of the immune system by decreasing the inflammatory response in chronic metabolic diseases. This study was first designed to investigate the potential role of dietary ALA on cognitive function and neuroinflammation in mice with SCZ. METHODS: In vivo, after 2 weeks of modeling, mice were treated with dietary ALA treatment for 6 weeks. In vitro, inflammation model was created using lipopolysaccharide as an inducer in BV2 microglial cells. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that ALA alleviated cognitive impairment and enhanced synaptic plasticity in mice with SCZ. Moreover, ALA mitigated systematic and cerebral inflammation through elevating IL-10 and inhibiting IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-α. Furthermore, ALA notably inhibited microglia and pro-inflammatory monocytes, as well as microglial activation andpolarization. Mechanistically, ALA up-regulated the expressions of G protein coupled receptor (GPR) 120 and associated β-inhibitor protein 2 (β-arrestin2), accompanied by observable weakened levels of transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1), NF-κB p65, cysteine proteinase-1 (caspase-1), pro-caspase-1, associated speck-like protein (ASC) and NLRP3. In vitro, ALA directly restrained the inflammation of microglia by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors and regulating microglial polarization via GPR120-NF-κB/NLRP3inflammasome signaling pathway, whereas AH7614 definitely eliminated this anti-inflammatory effect of ALA. CONCLUSION: Dietary ALA ameliorates microglia-mediated neuroinflammation by suppressing the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway via binding GPR120-β-arrestin2.",

Thus, we investigated whether changes in mitochondrial function are associated with the genetic variation in FADS1 (rs174550) in human adipocytes isolated from individuals consuming diets enriched with either dietary alpha-linolenic (ALA) or linoleic acid (LA). Two cohorts of men homozygous for the genotype of FADS1 (rs174550) were studied: FADSDIET2 dietary intervention study with ALA- and LA-enriched diets and Kuopio Obesity Surgery study (KOBS), respectively. We could demonstrate that differentiated human adipose-derived stromal cells from subjects with the TT genotype had higher mitochondrial metabolism compared with subjects with the CC genotype of FADS1-rs174550 in the FADSDIET2. Responses to PUFA-enriched diets differed between the genotypes of FADS1-rs174550, showing that ALA, but not LA, -enriched diet stimulated mitochondrial metabolism more in subjects with the CC genotype when compared with subjects with the TT genotype. ALA, but not LA, proportion in plasma phospholipid fraction correlated positively with adipose tissue mitochondrial-DNA amount in subjects with the CC genotype of FADS1-rs174550 in the KOBS. These findings demonstrate that the FADS1-rs174550 is associated with modification in mitochondrial function in human adipocytes. Additionally, subjects with the CC genotype, when compared with the TT genotype, benefit more from the ALA-enriched diet, leading to enhanced energy metabolism in human adipocytes. Altogether, the FADS1-rs174550 could be a genetic marker to identify subjects who are most suitable to receive dietary PUFA supplementation, establishing also a personalized therapeutic strategy to improve mitochondrial function in metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Myosteatosis occurs in response to excess circulating fatty acids and is associated with muscle dysfunction. This study aimed to characterize the sequence of events of lipid-induced toxicity within muscle cells and the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as potential preventive factors. Myosteatosis was induced in C2C12 myotubes exposed to palmitic acid (PAL 500µM). Furthermore, cells were co-incubated with PUFA (α-linolenic acid = ALA, Eicosapentaenoic acid = EPA, Docosahexaenoic acid = DHA; Arachidonic acid = ARA) over a period of 48 h. Cell viability, morphology, and measures of lipid and protein metabolism were assessed at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. We observed that myotube integrity was rapidly and progressively disrupted by PAL treatment after 12 h, ultimately leading to cell death (41.7% cell survival at 48 h, p < .05). Cell death did not occur in cells exposed to PAL+ARA and PAL+DHA. After 6 h of PAL treatment, an accumulation of large lipid droplets was observed within the cell (6 folds, p < .05). This was associated with an increase in ceramides (CER x3 fold change) and diacylglycerol (DAG x150 fold change) contents (p < .05). At the same time, insulin was no longer able to stimulate protein synthesis (p < .05) nor leverage autophagic flux (p < .05). DHA and ARA were able to completely reverse the defect in protein synthesis and partially modulate the accumulation of CER and DAG. These findings present new and intriguing research avenues in the field of muscle metabolism and nutrition, particularly in the context of aging, chronic muscle disorders, and insulin resistance.",

Our investigation encompassed characterization of the liposomal formulation, encompassing aspects like particle size, surface morphology, chemical structure, drug release kinetics, and stability. Compatibility studies were performed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). By utilizing the Box-Behnken design (BBD), we developed ALA-based liposomes with satisfactory particle size and entrapment efficiency. It is noteworthy that ALA incorporation led to a slight increase in particle size but did not notably affect drug entrapment. In vitro drug release assessments unveiled a sustained release pattern, with ALA-PTX liposomes demonstrating release profiles comparable to PTX liposomes. Morphological examinations confirmed the spherical structure of the liposomes, indicating that substituting ALA with phosphatidylcholine did not alter the physicochemical properties. Cellular uptake investigations showcased enhanced uptake of ALA-based liposomes in contrast to PTX liposomes, likely attributed to the heightened fluidity conferred by ALA. Efficacy against MCF-7 cells demonstrated concentration-dependent reductions in cell viability, with ALA-PTX liposomes exhibiting the lowest IC50 value. Morphological analysis confirmed apoptotic changes in cells treated with all formulations, with ALA-PTX liposomes eliciting more pronounced changes, indicative of enhanced anticancer efficacy."

A large body of evidence suggests that flaxseed oil (FSO), as one of the richest sources of essential omega-3 fatty acids, i.e., α-linolenic acids (ALA), displays neuroprotective properties. Here, we report the preventive effects of dietary FSO treatment in a rat model of TMT intoxication. The administration of FSO (1 mL/kg, orally) before and over the course of TMT intoxication (a single dose, 8 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced hippocampal cell death, prevented the activation of astrocytes, and inhibited their polarization toward a pro-inflammatory/neurotoxic phenotype. The underlying protective mechanism was delineated through the selective upregulation of BDNF and PI3K/Akt and the suppression of ERK activation in the hippocampus. Pretreatment with FSO reduced cell death and efficiently suppressed the expression of inflammatory molecules. These beneficial effects were accompanied by an increased intrahippocampal content of n-3 fatty acids. In vitro, ALA pretreatment prevented the TMT-induced polarization of cultured astrocytes towards the pro-inflammatory spectrum. Together, these findings support the beneficial neuroprotective properties of FSO/ALA against TMT-induced neurodegeneration and accompanied inflammation and hint at a promising preventive use of FSO in hippocampal degeneration and dysfunction.",

Our study aimed to simultaneously investigate the liver phospholipid fatty acid composition in response to chronic linseed, palm, or sunflower oil diets. We used adult female C57/BL6 mice and randomly divided them into control and three groups treated with 25 % dietary oils. Prior to treatment, we analyzed the fatty acid profiles in dietary oils and hepatocytes and, after 100 days, the fatty acid composition in the liver using gas-liquid chromatography. Linseed oil treatment elevated alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosapentaenoic acids and reduced arachidonic and docosatetraenoic acids, consequently lowering the n-6/n-3 ratio. Palm oil treatment increased linoleic acid and decreased docosahexaenoic acid, contributing to an elevated n-6/n-3 ratio. Sunflower oil treatment elevated total monounsaturated fatty acids by increasing palmitoleic, oleic, and vaccenic acids. The estimated activity of Δ9 desaturase was significantly elevated in the sunflower oil group, while Δ5 desaturase was the highest, and Δ6 desaturase was the lowest after the linseed oil diet. Our findings demonstrate that chronic consumption of linseed, palm, or sunflower oil alters the distribution of liver phospholipid fatty acids differently. Sunflower oil diet elevated total monounsaturated fatty acids, proposing potential benefits for liver tissue health. Considering these outcomes, a substantial recommendation emerges to elevate linseed oil intake, recognized as the principal ALA source, thereby aiding in reducing the n-6/n-3 ratio. Moreover, modifying dietary habits to incorporate specific vegetable oils in daily consumption could substantially enhance overall health.",

      "abstract": "One of the most devastating diseases of apples is scab, caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. Most commercial apple varieties are susceptible to this disease; only a few are resistant. Breeding approaches are being used to develop better apple varieties that are resistant to scab. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contribute greatly to a plant's phenotype, and their emission profile largely depends on the genotype. In the non-destructive phenotyping of plants, VOCs can be used as biomarkers. In this study, we assessed non-destructively the scab tolerance potential of resistant (cv. 'Prima') and susceptible (cv. 'Oregon Spur') apple cultivars by comparing their major leaf VOC compositions and relative proportions. A comparison of the leaf VOC profiles of the two cultivars revealed 16 different VOCs, with cis-3-hexenyl acetate (3HA) emerging as a biomarker of cultivar differences. V. inaequalis growth was significantly inhibited in vitro by 3HA treatment. 3HA was significantly effective in reducing scab symptoms on V. inaequalis-inoculated leaves of 'Oregon Spur.' The resistant cultivar 'Prima' also exhibited higher lipoxygenase (LOX) activity and α-linolenic acid (ALA) levels, suggesting that V. inaequalis resistance is linked to LOX activity and 3HA biosynthesis. This study proposes 3HA as a potential biomarker for rapid non-destructive screening of scab-resistant apple germplasm of 'Prima' based on leaf VOCs.",

The study was designed to examine CFTR modulator-associated changes in nutrition status, including bile acids and fatty acids after lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy for 24 weeks. METHODS: Children 2 to 5.9 years were recruited from US and Canadian CF Centers. Eligible children were lumacaftor/ivacaftor naïve and approved to initiate therapy. Anthropometrics, diet, energy expenditure, nutrition biomarkers, pancreatic status, serum and fecal calprotectin, serum bile acids and plasma fatty acids were measured. Changes from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks were examined using mixed effects linear regression modeling. RESULTS: Weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) increased at 12 (0.15 ± 0.1, p = 0.01) and 24 weeks (0.23 ± 0.1, p = 0.001) from baseline following modulator therapy. Head circumference-for-age (HCZ) increased at 12 weeks compared to baseline (0.22 ± 0.1, p = 0.03) and subscapular Z score increased from baseline at 24 weeks following therapy (0.33 ± 0.1, p = 0.02). There were no changes in energy expenditure. Serum total bile acids (6.7 ± 2.0, p = 0.001), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (2.4 ± 1.1, p = 0.001), and cholic acid (CA) (3.5 ± 0.8, p < 0.0001) increased at 24 weeks compared to baseline. Fecal calprotectin decreased at 12 and 24 weeks compared to baseline (-463 ± 310, p = 0.03 and 566 ± 347, p = 0.047). A number of plasma fatty acids changed over the course of 24 weeks of therapy. Noteably, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) decreased at 12 and 24 weeks (-24 ± 10,p = 0.03 and -18 ± 10, p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, young children experienced favorable changes in nutritional and growth, with the exception of plasma ALA status in the first 24 weeks of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy.",

      "abstract": "Both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids (FA) have numerous significant physiological roles for mammals. The interplay between these families of FA is of interest in companion animal nutrition due to the influence of the n-6:n-3 FA ratio on the modulation of the inflammatory response in disease management and treatment. As both human and animal diets have shifted to greater consumption of vegetable oils rich in n-6 FA, the supplementation of n-3 FA to canine, feline, and equine diets has been advocated for. Although fish oils are commonly added to supply the long-chain n-3 FA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a heavy reliance on this ingredient by the human, pet food, and equine supplement industries is not environmentally sustainable. Instead, sustainable sourcing of plant-based oils rich in n-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA), such as flaxseed and camelina oils, emerges as a viable option to support an optimal n-6:n-3 FA ratio. Moreover, ALA may offer health benefits that extend beyond its role as a precursor for endogenous EPA and DHA production. The following review underlines the metabolism and recommendations of n-6 and n-3 FA for dogs, cats, and horses and the ratio between them in promoting optimal health and inflammation management. Additionally, insights into both marine and plant-based n-3 FA sources will be discussed, along with the commercial practicality of using plant oils rich in ALA for the provision of n-3 FA to companion animals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are the most critical risk factors for chronic diseases. The quality of dietary fatty acids as one of the factors affecting fat accumulation has received little attention. This study investigates the association between dietary linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) with body fat indices in a sample of healthy Iranian adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cohort-based cross-sectional study, 3,195 individuals aged 20 to 60 who participated in the Shiraz University of Medical Science Employees Health Cohort study were included. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 118-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and body composition was assessed by the bioelectrical impedance analysis method. Multiple linear regression adjusted for relevant confounders was used to determine the associations. RESULTS: Mean dietary intake of LA was 14.20 ± 7.01 mg/day for men and 13.90 ± 6.71 mg/day for women. Additionally, the daily intake of ALA was 0.18 ± 0.18 mg/day in men and 0.17 ± 0.19 mg/day in women. Dietary intake of ALA for men had an inversely significant association with body fat mass (BFM) (β: -0.585, 95% CI: -1.137, -0.032, P=0.038), percentage of body fat (PBF) (β: -0.537, 95% CI: -0.945, -0.129, P=0.010), Visceral Fat Area (VFA) (β: -2.998, 95% CI: -5.695, -0.302, P=0.029), and Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) (β: -0.689, 95% CI: -1.339, -0.040, P=0.038). CONCLUSION: Higher dietary ALA intake was associated with lower BFM, BFP, VAF, and WHR in men. The present study confirms that ALA intake should be considered a preventive treatment to improve body composition. However, further research is recommended in this regard."

      "abstract": "Epilepsy ranks fourth among neurological diseases, featuring spontaneous seizures and behavioural and cognitive impairments. Although anti-epileptic drugs are currently available clinically, 30 % of epilepsy patients are still ineffective in treatment and 52 % of patients experience serious adverse reactions. In this work, the neuroprotective effect of α-linolenic acid (ALA, a nutrient) in mice and its potential molecular mechanisms exposed to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was assessed. The mice were injected with pentetrazol 37 mg/kg, and ALA was intra-gastrically administered for 40 d. The treatment with ALA significantly reduced the overall frequency of epileptic seizures and improved the behaviour impairment and cognitive disorder caused by pentetrazol toxicity. In addition, ALA can not only reduce the apoptosis rate of brain neurons in epileptic mice but also significantly reduce the content of brain inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-α). Furthermore, we predicted that the possible targets of ALA in the treatment of epilepsy were JAK2 and STAT3 through molecular docking. Finally, through molecular docking and western blot studies, we revealed that the potential mechanism of ALA ameliorates PTZ-induced neuron apoptosis and neurological impairment in mice with seizures by down-regulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. This study aimed to investigate the anti-epileptic and neuroprotective effects of ALA, as well as explore its potential mechanisms, through the construction of a chronic ignition mouse model via intraperitoneal PTZ injection. The findings of this research provide crucial scientific support for subsequent clinical application studies in this field.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nephritis is a pivotal catalyst in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Although epidemiological studies have explored the impact of plasma circulating metabolites and drugs on nephritis, few have harnessed genetic methodologies to establish causal relationships. METHODS: Through Mendelian randomization (MR) in two substantial cohorts, spanning large sample sizes, we evaluated over 100 plasma circulating metabolites and 263 drugs to discern their causal effects on nephritis risk. The primary analytical tool was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis. Our bioinformatic scrutiny of GSE115857 (IgA nephropathy, 86 samples) and GSE72326 (lupus nephritis, 238 samples) unveiled anomalies in lipid metabolism and immunological characteristics in nephritis. Thorough sensitivity analyses (MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out analysis) were undertaken to verify the instrumental variables' (IVs) assumptions. RESULTS: Unique lipoprotein-related molecules established causal links with diverse nephritis subtypes. Notably, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) emerged as a protective factor for acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) (OR1 = 0.84, [95% CI 0.78-0.90], p1 = 0.013; OR2 = 0.89, [95% CI 0.82-0.97], p2 = 0.007). Conversely, multivitamin supplementation minus minerals notably increased the risk of ATIN (OR = 31.25, [95% CI 9.23-105.85], p = 0.004). Reduced α-linolenic acid (ALA) levels due to lipid-lowering drugs were linked to both ATIN (OR = 4.88, [95% CI 3.52-6.77], p < 0.001) and tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) (OR = 7.52, [95% CI 2.78-20.30], p = 0.042). While the non-renal drug indivina showed promise for TIN treatment, the use of digoxin, hydroxocobalamin, and liothyronine elevated the risk of chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN). Transcriptome analysis affirmed that anomalous lipid metabolism and immune infiltration are characteristic of IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis. The robustness of these causal links was reinforced by sensitivity analyses and leave-one-out tests, indicating no signs of pleiotropy. CONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia significantly contributes to nephritis development. Strategies aimed at reducing plasma low-density lipoprotein levels or ALA supplementation may enhance the efficacy of existing lipid-lowering drug regimens for nephritis treatment. Renal functional status should also be judiciously considered with regard to the use of nonrenal medications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal, genetically determined cardiovascular risk factor. Limited evidence suggests that dietary unsaturated fat may increase serum Lp(a) concentration by 10-15 %. Linoleic acid may increase Lp(a) concentration through its endogenous conversion to arachidonic acid, a process regulated by the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster. We aimed to compare the Lp(a) and other lipoprotein trait-modulating effects of dietary alpha-linolenic (ALA) and linoleic acids (LA). Additionally, we examined whether FADS1 rs174550 genotype modifies Lp(a) responses. METHODS: A genotype-based randomized trial was performed in 118 men homozygous for FADS1 rs174550 SNP (TT or CC). After a 4-week run-in period, the participants were randomized to 8-week intervention diets enriched with either Camelina sativa oil (ALA diet) or sunflower oil (LA diet) 30-50 mL/day based on their BMI. Serum lipid profile was measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: ALA diet lowered serum Lp(a) concentration by 7.3 % (p = 0.003) and LA diet by 9.5 % (p < 0.001) (p = 0.089 for between-diet difference). Both diets led to greater absolute decreases in individuals with higher baseline Lp(a) concentration (p < 0.001). Concentrations of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), non-HDL-C, remnant-C, and apolipoprotein B were lowered more by the ALA diet (p < 0.01). Lipid or lipoprotein responses were not modified by the FADS1 rs174550 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable increase in either dietary ALA or LA from vegetable oils has a similar Lp(a)-lowering effect, whereas ALA may lower other major atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins to a greater extent than LA. Genetic differences in endogenous PUFA conversion may not influence serum Lp(a) concentration.",

      "abstract": "Iridovirus poses a substantial threat to global aquaculture due to its high mortality rate; however, the molecular mechanisms underpinning its pathogenesis are not well elucidated. Here, a multi-omics approach was applied to groupers infected with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), focusing on the roles of key metabolites. Results showed that SGIV induced obvious histopathological damage and changes in metabolic enzymes within the liver. Furthermore, SGIV significantly reduced the contents of lipid droplets, triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipoproteins. Metabolomic analysis indicated that the altered metabolites were enriched in 19 pathways, with a notable down-regulation of lipid metabolites such as glycerophosphates and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), consistent with disturbed lipid homeostasis in the liver. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data revealed that the top enriched pathways were related to cell growth and death and nucleotide, carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, supporting the conclusion that SGIV infection induced liver metabolic reprogramming. Further integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis indicated that SGIV infection activated crucial molecular events in a phagosome-immune depression-metabolism dysregulation-necrosis signaling cascade. Of note, integrative multi-omics analysis demonstrated the consumption of ALA and linoleic acid (LA) metabolites, and the accumulation of L-glutamic acid (GA), accompanied by alterations in immune, inflammation, and cell death-related genes. Further experimental data showed that ALA, but not GA, suppressed SGIV replication by activating antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses in the host. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive resource for understanding host response dynamics during fish iridovirus infection and highlight the antiviral potential of ALA in the prevention and treatment of iridoviral diseases.",

Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has been reported to exhibit multiple pharmaceutical effects. This study aimed to explore the effects of ALA on obesity-induced adipose tissue accumulation, cognitive impairment, inflammation, and colonic mucosal barrier integrity. METHODS: Mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) and were treated with ALA (60 or 100 mg/kg). Body weight, adipose tissue, serum glucose and lipid levels, glucose resistance, and insulin resistance were measured. Cognitive ability was analyzed using the behavior tests. PTP1B and IRS/p-AKT/p-GSK3β/p-Tau signaling were examined to evaluate inflammation and synaptogenesis. Colon mucosal barrier integrity was examined by Alcian blue staining and expression of the tight junction proteins. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and liver damages were evaluated. 3T3-L1 cells were used for in vitro experiments. Cell viability, migration and invasion were detected. The levels of ROS, iron, and ferrous ions were measured to assess ferroptosis. Metabolomic analysis of adipose tissues was performed. RESULTS: ALA treatment prevented HFD-induced adipose tissue accumulation, improved glucose and lipid homeostasis and metabolism. Administration of ALA repressed the HFD-induced increase in insulin levels and insulin resistance index. Serum and colon levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were decreased after ALA treatment. ALA elevated mitochondrial content in brown adipose tissues. ALA ameliorated obesity-induced cognitive impairment and hippocampal inflammation, enhanced colon mucosa integrity. ALA treatment ameliorated HFD-induced liver damage and lipid accumulation and inhibited differentiation of preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells into mature adipocytes and induces ferroptosis. Metabolomic analysis suggested that ALA may target the glycerolipid metabolism pathway to ameliorate obesity. Knockdown of AGPAT2 abolished the protective effects of ALA. CONCLUSION: ALA treatment suppressed adipose accumulation in adipocytes, improved cognitive ability and colon integrity, and alleviated liver damage by modulating the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2)."

The ALA and total n-3 PUFA content in the breast and leg meat of HE-treated quail were, respectively, 1.3 and 1.1 times higher (p < 0.01) than in the C group but the accumulation was lower compared to the CA group. The content of γ-linolenic acid was found to be 1.21-1.31 times higher in HE quail meat (p < 0.01). However, hempseed cake supplementation had a negative effect on growth performance. The supplementation of quail feed with camelina or hempseed cakes resulted in the production of healthy meat with an increased n-3 PUFA content."

The direct pathways and specific mechanisms in the central nervous system (CNS) for addressing fatty acid imbalances in MetS have not yet been fully elucidated. Among polyunsaturated acids, linoleic acid (LA, n6-PUFA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA, n3-PUFA), which are two essential fatty acids that should be provided by food sources (e.g., vegetable oils and seeds), have been reported to regulate various cellular mechanisms including apoptosis, inflammatory responses, mitochondrial biogenesis, and insulin signaling. Furthermore, inadequate intake of LA and ALA is reported to be involved in neuropathology and neuropsychiatric diseases as well as imbalanced metabolic conditions. Herein, we review the roles of LA and ALA on metabolic-related dementia focusing on insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, synaptic plasticity, cognitive function, and neuropsychiatric issues. This review suggests that LA and ALA are important fatty acids for concurrent treatment of both MetS and neurological problems.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral infection with cysts is the main transmission route of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), which leads to lethal intestinal inflammation. It has been widely recognized that T. gondii infection alters the composition and metabolism of the gut microbiota, thereby affecting the progression of toxoplasmosis. However, the potential mechanisms remain unclear. In our previous study, there was a decrease in the severity of toxoplasmosis after T. gondii α-amylase (α-AMY) was knocked out. Here, we established mouse models of ME49 and Δα-amy cyst infection and then took advantage of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis to identify specific gut microbiota-related metabolites that mitigate T. gondii-induced intestinal inflammation and analyzed the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the intestinal inflammation between ME49 cyst- and Δα-amy cyst-infected mice, and transferring feces from mice infected with Δα-amy cysts into antibiotic-treated mice mitigated colitis caused by T. gondii infection. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the relative abundances of gut bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, [Prevotella], Paraprevotella and Macellibacteroides, were enriched in mice challenged with Δα-amy cysts. Spearman correlation analysis between gut microbiota and metabolites indicated that some fatty acids, including azelaic acid, suberic acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and citramalic acid, were highly positively correlated with the identified bacterial genera. Both oral administration of ALA and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and restrained the MyD88/NF-κB pathway, which mitigated colitis and ultimately improved host survival. Furthermore, transferring feces from mice treated with ALA reshaped the colonization of beneficial bacteria, such as Enterobacteriaceae, Proteobacteria, Shigella, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings demonstrate that the host gut microbiota is closely associated with the severity of T. gondii infection. We provide the first evidence that ALA can alleviate T. gondii-induced colitis by improving the dysregulation of the host gut microbiota and suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the MyD88/NF-κB pathway. Our study provides new insight into the medical application of ALA for the treatment of lethal intestinal inflammation caused by Toxoplasma infection. Video Abstract.",

      "abstract": "Camelina (Camelina sativa) is a hardy, low-input oilseed crop that provides a rich source of the n-3 fatty acid, α-linolenic acid (ALA). The primary purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of dietary camelina oil (CAM) consumption on various health parameters, as compared to horses fed canola oil (OLA) or flax oil (FLX). Secondly, to determine how dietary CAM, FLX, and OLA alter circulating plasma total lipids across time. Thirty horses, from three separate herds, were used for this study [14.9 years ± 5.3 years; 544 ± 66 kg calculated BW (mean ± SD)]. After a 4-week gradual acclimation period using sunflower oil mixed with soaked hay cubes, horses were balanced by location, age, sex, weight, and breed and randomly allocated to one of three treatment oils (CAM, OLA, or FLX) at an inclusion of 370 mg of oil/kg BW/day. Horses had ad libitum access to hay and/or pasture for the duration of the study. Body condition score (BCS), BW, oil intake, complete blood counts, plasma biochemical profiles, and plasma total lipids were measured on weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 throughout the 16-week treatment period. BW, BCS, and oil intake were analyzed using an ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS Studio. Complete blood counts and biochemical profiles were analyzed using an ANCOVA, and fatty acids were analyzed using an ANOVA in PROC MIXED in SAS Studio. No differences were observed among treatment groups for BW, BCS, oil intake, complete blood counts, and biochemical parameters. Individual fatty acids that differed among treatments and/or across time were largely reflective of the different FA profiles of the oils provided. Most notably, plasma ALA was greater for FLX than OLA, but neither differed from CAM (P = 0.01). Linoleic acid did not differ among treatments or over time (P > 0.05). The n-6:n-3 ratio decreased over time for both CAM and FLX, and ratios were lower for FLX than OLA at week 16, but not different from CAM (P = 0.02). These results suggest that dietary CAM had no adverse effects on health parameters and that daily supplementation of CAM and FLX at 370 mg of oil/kg BW/day induces positive changes (a decrease) in the n-6:n-3 status of the horse. Consequently, CAM may be considered as an alternative oil to FLX in equine diets.",

      "abstract": "Oral cancer ranks sixth among Taiwan's top 10 cancers and most patients with poor prognosis acquire metastases. The essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has been found to diminish many cancer properties. However, the anti-cancer activity of ALA in oral cancer has yet to be determined. We examined the mechanisms underlying ALA inhibition of metastasis and induction of apoptotic cell death in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Migration and invasion assays confirmed the cancer cells' EMT capabilities, whereas flow cytometry and Western blotting identified molecular pathways in OSCC. ALA dramatically reduced cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner according to the findings. Low concentrations of ALA (100 or 200 μM) inhibit colony formation, the expression of Twist and EMT-related proteins, the expression of MMP2/-9 proteins, and enzyme activity, as well as cell migration and invasion. Treatment with high concentrations of ALA (200 or 400 μM) greatly increases JNK phosphorylation and c-jun nuclear accumulation and then upregulates the FasL/caspase8/caspase3 and Bid/cytochrome c/caspase9/caspase3 pathways, leading to cell death. Low concentrations of ALA inhibit SAS and GNM cell migration and invasion by suppressing Twist and downregulating EMT-related proteins or by decreasing the protein expression and enzyme activity of MMP-2/-9, whereas high concentrations of ALA promote apoptosis by activating the JNK/FasL/caspase 8/caspase 3-extrinsic pathway and the Bid/cytochrome c/caspase 9 pathway. ALA demonstrates potential as a treatment for OSCC patients.",

      "abstract": "Globally, penaeid shrimp are the most farmed and traded aquatic organisms, although they are easily susceptible to microbial pathogens. Moreover, there is a desire to increase the nutritional value of shrimp, especially the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which also possess immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Some aquatic animals can synthesize EPA and DHA from dietary plant-sourced alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), but penaeid shrimps' ability to synthesize these n-3 PUFAs is unknown. Here, molecular biology techniques, including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, qPCR, ELISA, etc., were used to demonstrate that exogenous ALA or Vibrio parahaemolyticus could modulate EPA and DHA levels and immune genes in Penaeus vannamei by inducing key enzymes involved in n-3 PUFAs biosynthesis, such as delta desaturases and elongation of very long-chain fatty acid (ELOVLs). Most importantly, knockdown or inhibition of ∆6 desaturase significantly decreased EPA and DHA levels and immune gene expression even with exogenous ALA treatment, consequently affecting shrimp antibacterial immunity and survival. This study provides new insight into the potential of P. vannamei to synthesize n-3 PUFAs from exogenous ALA or upon bacteria challenge, which could be leveraged to increase their nutritional content and antimicrobial immunity.",

Although the main mechanism of the toxic effect of MTX is not known, it is stated that it causes oxidative stress and inflammation. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) protects against oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. For this reason, we aimed to find out the useful effect of ALA on MTX-induced nephrotoxicity MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mice were divided into 4 groups randomly. The control group was treated with physiological saline solution; the ALA group was treated with ALA (200 mg/kg) by gavage; MTX-treated group received 20 mg/kg i.p. (intraperitoneal) MTX; and MTX+ALA treated group received 20 mg/kg i.p. MTX and ALA 200 mg/kg by gavage. All of the drugs were performed once a day for 9 days. RESULTS: Alpha-linolenic acid significantly decreased oxidative stress parameters and MTX-induced inflammatory and apoptotic mediators. Furthermore, histopathological examination showed that MTX induced significant edematous damage, and ALA treatment attenuated this damage in renal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that ALA may be helpful against MTX-induced nephrotoxicity in mice via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",

Thus play a major role not only in their development, but also exerts as a crucial linking factor among those diseases. In this regard, one of the strategies for tackling this problem is application of antioxidants to treat such diseases. The present study was performed to evaluate the synergistic effects of punicic acid (PUA) and alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) as antioxidants and radical scavenging reagents on the expression of some inflammatory and metabolism-related genes under oxidative stress in the muscle cells. The experimental treatments consisted of a range of 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 µM of PUA, and 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µM of ALA with a 200 µM concentration of H2 O2 as an oxidative stress inducer. Accordingly, fatty acid treatments were applied for 24 h, and H2 O2 was treated for 1 h. Our results indicated that the simultaneous treatment of PUA and ALA at optimal concentrations (80 and 50 µM, respectively) decreased the expression of inflammation genes and increased the expression of regulatory genes (Pparγ, Pgc-1α) related to metabolism (p < .05). Unexpectedly, H2 O2 treatment increased the Fndc5 expression (p < .05). Maximal upregulation of Pparγ, Pgc-1α were obtained when fatty acids combination (PUA and ALA) were used in the culture of H2 O2 treated cells (p < .05). Therefore, our findings suggest that the simultaneous use of PUA and ALA fatty acids could reduce oxidative stress, and the expression of inflammatory genes, thereby improving the cell metabolism.",

      "abstract": "A major obstacle for chemotherapeutics in Glioblastoma (GB) is to reach the tumour cells due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and chemoresistance of anticancer drugs. The present study reports two polyunsaturated fatty acids, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) appended nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) of a CNS negative chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel (DTX) for targeted delivery to GB. The ligand appended DTX-NLCs demonstrated particle size < 160 nm, PDI < 0.29 and a negative surface charge. The successful linkage of GLA (41 %) and ALA (30 %) ligand conjugation to DTX- NLCs was confirmed by diminished surface amino groups on the NLCs, lower surface charge and FTIR profiling. Fluorophore labelled GLA-DTX-NLCs and ALA-DTX-NLCs permeated the in-vitro 3D BBB model with Papp values of 1.8 × 10-3 and 1.9 × 10-3 cm/s respectively. Following permeation, both formulations showed enhanced uptake by GB immortalised cells while ALA-DTX-NLCs showed higher uptake in patient-derived GB cells as evidenced in an in-vitro 3D blood brain tumour barrier (BBTB) model. Both surface functionalised formulations showed higher internalisation in GB cells as compared to bare DTX-NLCs. ALA-DTX-NLCs and GLA-DTX-NLCs showed 13.9-fold and 6.8-fold higher DTX activity respectively at 24 h as indicated by IC50 values when tested in patient-derived GB cells. ALA-DTX-NLCs displayed better efficacy than GLA-DTX-NLCs when tested against 3D tumour spheroids and patient-derived cells. These novel formulations will contribute widely to overcoming biological barriers for treating glioblastoma.",

However, no research exists assessing the effects of feeding camelina oil to horses in contrast to other commonly used oils. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of supplementing camelina oil to that of flaxseed and canola oil supplementation, on outcomes related to skin and coat health in horses. Thirty adult horses [23 mares, 7 geldings; 14.9 years ± 5.3 years; 544 ± 66 kg body weight (BW) (mean ± SD)] underwent a 4-week wash-in period consuming hay and sunflower oil. Following the wash-in period, horses were blocked by location, age, and BW, and assigned to one of three treatment oils for 16 weeks (370 mg oil/kg BW): camelina (CAM), canola (OLA), or flaxseed (FLX) oil. Blood samples were collected and plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; ELISA), nitric oxide (NO; Griess Reaction), and glycosaminoglycan (GAG; DMMB) concentrations were measured on weeks 0 (n = 30), 14 (n = 24), and 16 (n = 30). On weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured pre- and post-acetone application using a VapoMeter (n = 26), and a 5-point-Likert scale was used to assess skin and coat characteristics on the side and rump of the horses (n = 30). All data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. Independent of treatment, coat color, and quality increased from baseline. There were no differences in the outcomes assessed between the horses supplemented camelina oil and those supplemented canola or flaxseed oil. These results suggest that independent of treatment, all oil supplements improved coat color and quality in horses. This provides indication that camelina oil is comparable to existing plant-based oil supplements in supporting skin and coat health and inflammation in horses.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of influencing factors (sex, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) status at baseline, linoleic acid (LA) intake, milk fat intake) on the conversion of α-linolenic acid (ALA) obtained from linseed oil into its long-chain metabolites. In addition, the effect of ALA on cardiovascular risk markers was investigated. This study used a parallel design approach by randomly assigning the 134 subjects to one of four diets (high in LA (HLA); low in LA (LLA); high in milk fat (MF); control (Western diet)) each enriched with linseed oil (10 en%, 22-27 mL ≙ 13-16 g ALA). Blood samples were taken at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of dietary intervention. The study was fully completed by 105 subjects (57.4 ± 12.1 years; 65.7% female). Results showed that ALA (296-465%), C-20:4n3 (54-140%), and EPA (37-73%) concentrations in erythrocytes increased in all groups (p < 0.01). In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (19-35%, p < 0.01) and n-3 index (10-21%, p < 0.05) dropped in the HLA, LLA, and control groups. An increase in C-22:5n3 was only observed in the MF (36%) and control groups (11%) (p < 0.05). In addition, an increase in LA (7-27%) was found in the HLA, LLA, and control groups, whereas C-20:3n6 (16-22%), arachidonic acid (10-16%), C-22:4n6 (12-30%), and C-22:5n6 (32-47%) decreased (p < 0.01). The conversion into EPA was higher in men than in women (69 vs. 39%, p = 0.043) and in subjects with low EPA status compared to participants with high EPA status (79 vs. 29%, p < 0.001). A high LA status attenuates the conversion rate. In line with the literature, no clear effects on blood lipids and parameters of glucose metabolism were found in relation to ALA supplementation.",

Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a plant-based essential polyunsaturated fatty acid associated with reduced CVD risks. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of supplementation with ALA compared with the placebo on CVD risk factors in people with obesity or overweight (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews Registration No. CRD42023429563). This review included studies with adults using oral supplementation or food or combined interventions containing vegetable sources of ALA. All studies were randomly assigned trials with parallel or crossover designs. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used for assessing the risk of bias (Version 1). PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to April 2023. Nineteen eligible randomized controlled trials, including 1183 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, dietary ALA supplementation significantly reduced C-reactive protein concentration (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.38 mg/L; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.72, -0.04), tumor necrosis factor-α concentration (SMD = -0.45 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.73, -0.17), triglyceride in serum (SMD = -4.41 mg/dL; 95% CI: -5.99, -2.82), and systolic blood pressure (SMD = -0.37 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.66, -0.08); but led to a significant increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (SMD = 1.32 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.05, 2.59). ALA supplementation had no significant effect on interleukin-6, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P ≥ 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that ALA supplementation at a dose of ≥3 g/d from flaxseed and flaxseed oil had a more prominent effect on improving CVD risk profiles, particularly where the intervention duration was ≥12 wk and where the baseline CVD profile was poor.",

A comprehensive search was performed across four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and PubMed) to evaluate the influence of the low-ratio LA/ALA. Relevant references were screened up until February 2023. Intervention effects were analyzed by calculating change values as weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effects models. Additionally, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were employed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Twenty-one randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, and the low-ratio LA/ALA diet had no significant effect on fasting blood sugar (FBS, WMD: 0.00 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.06, p = 0.989, I2 = 0.0%), insulin levels (WMD: 0.20 μIU/mL, 95% CI: -0.23, 0.63, p = 0.360, I2 = 3.2%), homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, WMD: 0.09, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.23, p = 0.243, I2 = 0.0%), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, WMD: -0.01%, 95% CI: -0.07, 0.06, p = 0.836, I2 = 0.0%). Based on subgroup analyses, it was observed that the impact of a low-ratio LA/ALA diet on elevated plasma insulin (WMD: 1.31 μIU/mL, 95% CI: 0.08, 2.54, p = 0.037, I2 = 32.0%) and HOMA-IR (WMD: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.84, p = 0.012, I2 = 0.0%) levels exhibited greater prominence in North America compared to Asian and European countries. Publication bias was not detected for FBS, insulin, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c levels according to the Begg and Egger tests. Furthermore, the conducted sensitivity analyses indicated stability, as the effects of the low-ratio LA/ALA diet on various glycemic and related metrics remained unchanged even after removing individual studies. Overall, based on the available studies, it can be concluded that the low-ratio LA/ALA diet has limited impact on blood glucose-related biomarker levels.",

One of the alternative systems to drug therapy to minimize the risk of CVDs is represented by alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential fatty acid of the omega-3 series, known for its cholesterol-lowering effect. The main purpose of this review is to analyze the effects of ALA and investigate the relevant omega-6/omega-3 ratio in order to maintain functionally beneficial effects. Concerning the lipid-lowering preventive effects, ALA may favorably affect the values of LDL-C and triglycerides in both adult and pediatric populations. Furthermore, ALA has shown protective effects against hypertension, contributing to balancing blood pressure through customary diet. According to the 2009 EFSA statement, dietary ALA may contribute to reducing the risk of CVDs, thanks to anti-hypertensive, anti-atherosclerotic and cardioprotective effects.",

There was no significant effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (HDL-C, WMD: -0.00 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.02, p = 0.895, I2 = 0.0%). Subgroup analysis showed that low-ratio LA/ALA supplementation significantly decreased plasma TC, LDL-C, and TG concentrations when the intervention period was less than 12 weeks. In the subgroup analysis, a noteworthy decrease in both TC and LDL-C levels was observed in individuals receiving low-ratio LA/ALA supplementation in the range of 1-5. These findings suggest that this specific range could potentially be effective in reducing lipid profiles. The findings of this study provide additional evidence supporting the potential role of low-ratio LA/ALA supplementation in reducing TC, LDL-C, and TG concentrations, although no significant impact on HDL-C was observed."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a global concern. Studies on the impact of ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs) on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are almost non-existent. The aim was to investigate the change in whole-blood PUFA and nutrition and health markers among Cambodian children with SAM after treatment with RUTFs. METHODS: The trial was an 8-week randomised clinical trial of the effectiveness of locally produced fish-based RUTF (L-RUTF) vs standard milk-based RUFT (S-RUTF). Whole-blood fatty acids were analysed using dried blood spots. Nutrition and health markers were assessed using anthropometric assessment and blood samples for markers of inflammation. The trial was conducted at the National Pediatric Hospital, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, with one hundred and twenty-one 6-59-month-old children in treatment for SAM. RESULTS: L-RUTF had a higher content of n-3 PUFA and a higher content of arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), while S-RUTF had the highest content of n-6 PUFA. At baseline, the children presented with a Mead acid level in whole-blood of around 0.08% of total fatty acids (FA%) and an omega-3 index of ∼0.91 ± 0.44. After eight weeks of S-RUTF treatment, linoleic acid (LA), AA, n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, and Mead acid levels were increased. The L-RUTF intervention did not change the whole-blood PUFAs from baseline. At discharge, the children in the L-RUTF group had a lower n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio than the children in the S-RUTF group, driven by a lower alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (0.20 vs 0.27 FA%, p = 0.004) and lower LA (15.77 vs 14.21 FA%, p = 0.018) with no significant differences in AA or DHA levels. Weight-for-height z-score at discharge was negatively associated with total PUFA (β -1.4 FA%, 95%CI. -2.7; -0.1), n-6 LCPUFA (β -1.3 FA%, 95%CI. -1.3; -0.3), and AA (β -0.6 FA%, 95%CI. -1.0; -0.2). Age-adjusted height was negatively associated with the Mead acid:AA ratio (β -1.2 FA%, 95%CI. -2.2; -0.2). No significant change was seen in inflammation markers within groups or between groups during treatment, and n-3 and n-6 PUFAs were not associated with markers of inflammation or haemoglobin status at discharge. CONCLUSION: The trial found that whole-blood markers of PUFA status were low in children at admission and discharge from SAM treatment, indicating that the currently recommended composition of RUTFs are not able to correct their compromised essential fatty acid status. The higher content of DHA and AA in L-RUTF did not give rise to any improvement in PUFA status. No changes in health markers or associations between PUFA and health markers were found.

These viruses have added to the existing respiratory infection burden along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. There are limited therapies for respiratory viruses, with broad-spectrum treatment remaining an unmet need. Since gut fermentation of fiber produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral potential, developing a fatty acid-based broad-spectrum antiviral was investigated. Molecular docking of fatty acids showed α-linolenic acid (ALA) is likely to interact with CoV-2-S, NL63-CoV-S, and RSV-F, and an ALA-containing liposome interacted with CoV-2 directly, degrading the particle. Furthermore, a combination of ALA and a SCFA-acetate synergistically inhibited CoV2-N expression and significantly reduced viral plaque formation and IL-6 and IL-1β transcript expression in Calu-3 cells, while increasing the expression of IFN-β. A similar effect was also observed in RSV-infected A549 cells. Moreover, mice infected with a murine-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) and treated with an ALA-liposome encapsulating acetate showed significant reductions in plaque-forming units present in lung tissue and in infection-associated lung inflammation and cytokines. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ALA liposome-encapsulating acetate can be a promising broad antiviral therapy against respiratory infections.",

Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr. et Maxim.) Harms (ASH) (aqueous ethanol extract), a Chinese herbal medicine, provides obvious and noticeable therapeutic effects on PD. To further investigate the ASH's mechanism of action in treating PD, the structural and functional gut microbiota, as well as intestinal metabolite before and after ASH intervention in the PD mice model, were examined utilizing metagenomics and fecal metabolomics analysis. α-syn transgenic mice were randomly divided into a model and ASH groups, with C57BL/6 mice as a control. The ASH group was gavaged with ASH (45.5 mg/kg/d for 20d). The time of pole climbing and autonomous activity were used to assess motor ability. The gut microbiota's structure, composition, and function were evaluated using Illumina sequencing. Fecal metabolites were identified using UHPLC-MS/MS to construct intestinal metabolites. The findings of this experiment demonstrate that ASH may reduce the climbing time of PD model mice while increasing the number of autonomous movements. The results of metagenomics analysis revealed that ASH could up-regulated Firmicutes and down-regulated Actinobacteria at the phylum level, while Clostridium was up-regulated and Akkermansia was down-regulated at the genus level; it could also recall 49 species from the phylum Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes. Simultaneously, metabolomics analysis revealed that alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism might be a key metabolic pathway for ASH to impact in PD. Furthermore, metagenomics function analysis and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ASH might influence unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and purine metabolism pathways. These metabolic pathways are connected to ALA, Palmitic acid, Adenine, and 16 species of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes. Finally, these results indicate that ASH may alleviate the movement disorder of the PD model, which may be connected to the regulation of gut microbiota structure and function as well as the modulation of metabolic disorders by ASH."

The extensive biochemical analysis of flaxseed resulted in the identification of its bioactive, i.e., lignans with potential application in the improvement of human health. Flaxseed oil, fibers, and lignans exert potential health benefits including reduction of cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, and autoimmune and neurological disorders that have led to the diversification of flaxseed plant applications. This comprehensive review focuses on flaxseed oil as the major product of flaxseed with emphasis on the interrelationship between its chemical composition and biological effects. Effects reviewed include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, antiulcer, anti-osteoporotic, cardioprotective, metabolic, and neuroprotective. This study provides an overview of flaxseed oil effects with the reported action mechanisms related to its phytochemical composition and in comparison, to other PUFA-rich oils.

      "abstract": "Both linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) are essential dietary fatty acids, and a balanced dietary supply of these is of the utmost importance for health. In many countries across the globe, the LA level and LA/ALA ratio in breast milk (BM) are high. For infant formula (IF), the maximum LA level set by authorities (e.g., Codex or China) is 1400 mg LA/100 kcal ≈ 28% of total fatty acid (FA) ≈ 12.6% of energy. The aims of this study are: (1) to provide an overview of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels in BM across the world, and (2) to determine the health impact of different LA levels and LA/ALA ratios in IF by reviewing the published literature in the context of the current regulatory framework. The lipid composition of BM from mothers living in 31 different countries was determined based on a literature review. This review also includes data from infant studies (intervention/cohort) on nutritional needs regarding LA and ALA, safety, and biological effects. The impact of various LA/ALA ratios in IF on DHA status was assessed within the context of the current worldwide regulatory framework including China and the EU. Country averages of LA and ALA in BM range from 8.5-26.9% FA and 0.3-2.65% FA, respectively. The average BM LA level across the world, including mainland China, is below the maximum 28% FA, and no toxicological or long-term safety data are available on LA levels > 28% FA. Although recommended IF LA/ALA ratios range from 5:1 to 15:1, ratios closer to 5:1 seem to promote a higher endogenous synthesis of DHA. However, even those infants fed IF with more optimal LA/ALA ratios do not reach the DHA levels observed in breastfed infants, and the levels of DHA present are not sufficient to have positive effects on vision. Current evidence suggests that there is no benefit to going beyond the maximum LA level of 28% FA in IF. To achieve the DHA levels found in BM, the addition of DHA to IF is necessary, which is in line with regulations in China and the EU. Virtually all intervention studies investigating LA levels and safety were conducted in Western countries in the absence of added DHA. Therefore, well-designed intervention trials in infants across the globe are required to obtain clarity about optimal and safe levels of LA and LA/ALA ratios in IF.",

However, there are no licensed vaccines or drugs against ZIKV infection. Pregnant women have the greatest need for treatment, making drug safety crucial. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a polyunsaturated ω-3 fatty acid, has been used as a health-care product and dietary supplement due to its potential medicinal properties. Here, we demonstrated that ALA inhibits ZIKV infection in cells without loss of cell viability. Time-of-addition assay revealed that ALA interrupts the binding, adsorption, and entry stages of ZIKV replication cycle. The mechanism is probably that ALA disrupts membrane integrity of the virions to release ZIKV RNA, inhibiting viral infectivity. Further examination revealed that ALA inhibited DENV-2, HSV-1, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection dose-dependently. ALA is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral agent.",

This study investigated the effects of ALA on testosterone biosynthesis and the possible mechanism underlying the signaling pathway in primary Leydig cells of the rooster. METHODS: Primary rooster Leydig cells were treated with ALA (0, 20, 40, or 80 μmol/L) or pretreated with a p38 inhibitor (50 μmol/L), a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (20 μmol/L), or an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (20 μmol/L) before ALA treatment. Testosterone content in the conditioned culture medium was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of steroidogenic enzymes and JNK-SF-1 signaling pathway factors was detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Supplementation with ALA significantly increased testosterone secretion within culture media (P < 0.05), and the optimized dose was 40 μmol/L. Compared with the control group, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) mRNA expression significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the 40 μmol/L ALA group; 17-hydroxylase/c17-20 lyase (P450c17) and p38 mRNA expressions were not significantly different in the 40 μmol/L ALA group; ERK and JNK mRNA expressions were significantly upregulated (P < 0.05) in 40 μmol/L ALA group. In the inhibitor group, testosterone levels were significantly downregulated (P < 0.05). Compared with the 40 μmol/L ALA group, StAR, P450scc, and P450c17 mRNA expressions were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and 3β-HSD mRNA expression in the p38 inhibitor group did not change; StAR, P450scc, and 3β-HSD mRNA expressions were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and P450c17 mRNA expression in ERK inhibitor group did not change; StAR, P450scc, 3β-HSD, and P450c17 mRNA expressions were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in JNK inhibitor group. Additionally, the increased steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) gene expression levels induced by ALA were reversed when the cells were pre-incubated with JNK and ERK inhibitors. The levels in the JNK inhibitor group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ALA may promote testosterone biosynthesis by activating the JNK-SF-1 signaling pathway to upregulate StAR, P450scc, 3β-HSD, and P450c17 expression in primary rooster Leydig cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects and could be beneficial in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Higher dietary intake and plasma levels of PUFAs, in particular alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), have been associated with a lower risk of ALS in large epidemiologic cohort studies, but data on disease progression in patients with ALS are sparse. We examined whether plasma levels of ALA and other PUFAs contributed to predicting survival time and functional decline in patients with ALS. METHODS: We conducted a study among participants in the EMPOWER clinical trial who had plasma samples collected at the time of randomization that were available for fatty acid analyses. Plasma fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography. We used Cox proportional hazards models and linear regression to evaluate the association of individual fatty acids with risk of death and joint rank test score of functional decline and survival. RESULTS: Fatty acid analyses were conducted in 449 participants. The mean (SD) age of these participants at baseline was 57.5 (10.7) years, and 293 (65.3%) were men; 126 (28.1%) died during follow-up. Higher ALA levels were associated with lower risk of death (age-adjusted and sex-adjusted hazard ratio comparing highest vs lowest quartile 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.86, p-trend = 0.041) and higher joint rank test score (difference in score according to 1 SD increase 10.7, 95% CI 0.2-21.1, p = 0.045), consistent with a slower functional decline. The estimates remained similar in analyses adjusted for body mass index, race/ethnicity, symptom duration, site of onset, riluzole use, family history of ALS, predicted upright slow vital capacity, and treatment group. Higher levels of the n-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid and the n-6 fatty acid linoleic acid were associated with a lower risk of death during follow-up. DISCUSSION: Higher levels of ALA were associated with longer survival and slower functional decline in patients with ALS. These results suggest that ALA may have a favorable effect on disease progression in patients with ALS.",

However, failure to adhere to dietary recommendations can result in both unsatisfactory weight loss and metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of bariatric surgery on the anthropometric parameters and selected nutrient intake. A total of 12 months postoperatively, percent excess weight loss (%EWL) was significantly higher after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (93.78% vs. 56.13% and 55.65%, p < 0.001). The same was true for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (p = 0.017) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) changes (p = 0.022). There was a significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after RYGB. A significant decrease (p < 0.05) in daily intake was found for energy (4278.4 kcal vs. 1355.17 kcal), sucrose (122.23 g vs. 38.22 g), dietary fiber (30.90 g vs. 14.20 g), eicosapentaenoic fatty acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) (142.46 mg vs. 52.90 mg) and % energy from fats (42.43% vs. 35.17%), saturated fatty acids (SAFAs) (19.96% vs. 14.11%) and alpha-linolenic fatty acid (ALA) (0.87% vs. 0.69%). Energy intake and energy % from fats positively correlated with body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), WHR, and WHtR, and negatively with %EWL. The percentage of unsaturated fatty acids positively correlated with WC and WHR. Energy intake correlated positively with serum triglycerides (TGs) and energy % from fats and carbohydrates. Despite significant weight loss, the patient's diet deviated from recommendations and may have contributed to metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and its derivatives eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are \"essential\" fatty acids mainly obtained from diet sources comprising plant oils, marine blue fish, and commercially available fish oil supplements. Many epidemiological and retrospective studies suggested that ω-3 PUFA consumption decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease, but results of early intervention trials have not consistently confirmed this effect. In recent years, some large-scale randomized controlled trials have shed new light on the potential role of ω-3 PUFAs, particularly high-dose EPA-only formulations, in cardiovascular prevention, making them an attractive tool for the treatment of \"residual\" cardiovascular risk. ω-3 PUFAs' beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes go far beyond the reduction in triglyceride levels and are thought to be mediated by their broadly documented \"pleiotropic\" actions, most of which are directed to vascular protection. A considerable number of clinical studies and meta-analyses suggest the beneficial effects of ω-3 PUFAs in the regulation of blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. These effects occur mostly through regulation of the vascular tone that could be mediated by both endothelium-dependent and independent mechanisms. In this narrative review, we summarize the results of both experimental and clinical studies that evaluated the effect of ω-3 PUFAs on blood pressure, highlighting the mechanisms of their action on the vascular system and their possible impact on hypertension, hypertension-related vascular damage, and, ultimately, cardiovascular outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Hyperexcitability is a major mechanism implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as organophosphate-induced status epilepticus (SE), primary epilepsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. Underlying mechanisms are diverse, but a functional impairment and loss of GABAergic inhibitory neurons are common features in many of these disorders. While novel therapies abound to correct for the loss of GABAergic inhibitory neurons, it has been difficult at best to improve the activities of daily living for the majority of patients. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid found in plants. ALA exerts pleiotropic effects in the brain that attenuate injury in chronic and acute brain disease models. However, the effect of ALA on GABAergic neurotransmission in hyperexcitable brain regions involved in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, is unknown. Administration of a single dose of ALA (1500 nmol/kg) subcutaneously increased the charge transfer of inhibitory postsynaptic potential currents mediated by GABAA receptors in pyramidal neurons by 52% in the BLA and by 92% in the CA1 compared to vehicle animals a day later. Similar results were obtained in pyramidal neurons from the BLA and CA1 when ALA was bath-applied in slices from naïve animals. Importantly, pretreatment with the high-affinity, selective TrkB inhibitor, k252, completely abolished the ALA-induced increase in GABAergic neurotransmission in the BLA and CA1, suggesting a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated mechanism. Addition of mature BDNF (20 ng/mL) significantly increased GABAA receptor inhibitory activity in the BLA and CA1 pyramidal neurons similar to the results obtained with ALA. ALA may be an effective treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders where hyperexcitability is a major feature.",

Knowledge as to whether the type and concentrations of α-linolenic acid (ALA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the diet can make a difference to the birds' immune responses when subjected to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge is limited. OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to determine the potential nutritional and health benefits to laying hens when receiving dietary omega-3 PUFA from either ALA or DHA. METHODS: A total of 80 Lohmann LSL-Classic (white egg layer, 20 wk old) were randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment diets (10 hens/treatment), provided 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, or 0.8% of total dietary omega-3 PUFA, provided as either ALA-rich flaxseed oil or DHA-enriched algal biomass. After an 8-wk feeding period, the birds were challenged with Escherichia coli-derived LPS (8 mg/kg; i.v. injection), with terminal sample collection 4 h after challenge. Egg yolk, plasma, liver, and spleen samples were collected for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Increasing dietary omega-3 supplementation yielded predictable responses in egg yolk, plasma, and liver fatty acid concentrations. Dietary intake of ALA contributed mainly to ALA-derived oxylipins. Meanwhile, eicosapentaenoic acid- and DHA-derived oxylipins were primarily influenced by DHA dietary intake. LPS increased the concentrations of almost all the omega-6 PUFA-, ALA-, and DHA-derived oxylipins in plasma and decreased hepatic mRNA expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX (P < 0.001) involved in the biosynthesis of oxylipins. LPS also increased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and receptor TLR-4 (P < 0.001) in the spleen. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that dietary intake of ALA and DHA had unique impacts on fatty acid deposition and their derived oxylipins and inflammatory responses under the administration of LPS in laying hens.",

Alpha-linolenic acid [cis-9, cis-12, cis-15-octadecatrienoic acid (18:3)] (ALA) as dietary supplementation can reduce inflammation and allergic symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential therapeutic effect and mechanism of ALA in AR mouse model. METHODS: Ovalbumin sensitized AR mouse model were challenged with oral ALA administration. Nasal symptoms, tissue pathology, immune cell infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia were investigated. Levels of IgE, TNF-β, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13 and IL-25 were determined by ELISA in serum and nasal fluid. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence were performed for occludin and zonula occludens-1 expression. CD3+CD4+ T-cells from peripheral blood and splenic lymphocytes were isolated and Th1/Th2 ratio were determined. Mouse naive CD4+ T cell were isolated and Th1/Th2 ratio, IL-4Rα expression, and IL5/IL13 secretion were determined. IL-4Rα-JAK2-STAT3 pathway change in AR mice were performed by western blot. RESULTS: Ovalbumin induced AR, nasal symptoms, pathological performance, IgE, and cytokine production. ALA treated mice showed reduced nasal symptoms, nasal inflammation, nasal septum thickening, goblet cell hyperplasia, and eosinophil infiltration. In serum and nasal fluid of ovalbumin challenged mice, ALA decreased IgE, IL-4 levels, and the increase of Th2-cells. ALA prevented the disruption of the epithelial cell barrier in ovalbumin-challenged AR mice. Simultaneously, ALA prevents IL-4 induced barrier disruption. ALA treatment of AR by affecting the differentiation stage of CD4+T cells and block IL-4Rα-JAK2-STAT3 pathway. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that ALA has the potential therapeutic effect to ovalbumin-induced AR. ALA can affect the differentiation stage of CD4+T cells and improve epithelial barrier functions through IL-4Rα-JAK2-STAT3 pathways. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: ALA might be considered as drug candidate for improving epithelial barrier function through Th1/Th2 ratio recovery in AR.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary metabolizable energy (ME) level and the ratio of linoleic acid:α-linolenic acid (LA:ALA) on the growth performance, lipid metabolism, circulatory and joint inflammatory status, and synovial fluid proteome of grow-finish pigs. A total of 224 pigs (BW = 41.5 ± 6.1 kg; PIC Genus 337 × 1050, Hendersonville, TN) were randomly assigned to either a high (3.55 Mcal/kg; HE) or low (3.29 Mcal/kg; LE) ME dietary treatment with a high (23:1) or low (12:1) LA:ALA in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Diets were fed across three 28-d phases. Pigs were housed either four barrows or four gilts per pen. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 21, 42, and 84. Synovial fluid was collected from the hock and carpus joints on days 0 and 84. Liver and adipose tissue samples were collected on day 84. Data were analyzed as repeated measures using PROC MIXED (SAS 9.4) with pen as the experimental unit and energy level, essential fatty acid ratio, sex, phase, and their interactions as fixed effects. Compared to LE, HE increased days 28, 56, and 84 body weight (BW; P = 0.005). For the overall period, HE increased average daily gain (ADG) compared to LE (P < 0.001) and improved feed efficiency (P = 0.001), while LE increased feed intake compared to HE (P < 0.001). Gilts receiving diets with low LA:ALA had similar final BW to barrows receiving a low LA:ALA at days 28, 56, and 84 (P = 0.024), resulting from improved overall days 0-84 ADG compared to gilts receiving the high LA:ALA (P = 0.031). In the liver, HE decreased the mRNA abundance of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACACA; P = 0.004), cluster of differentiation 36 (P = 0.034), and tended to decrease fatty acid synthase (FASN; P = 0.056). In adipose tissue, HE decreased ACACA (P = 0.001) and FASN (P = 0.017). Plasma inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) were reduced on day 84 compared to day 0 (P ≤ 0.014). In the hock and carpus synovial fluid, LE tended to reduce CRP and TNFα (P ≤ 0.096). Hock and carpus synovial fluid CRP were also reduced on day 84 compared to day 0 (P = 0.001). Age of the pig impacted serum and hock synovial fluid protein abundance, but not energy level, LA:ALA, or their interactions (P < 0.05). To conclude, the high and low LA:ALA ratios utilized in this study can be fed at varying energy levels without impacting growth. Additionally, LA:ALA ratios can differentially impact the growth of barrows and gilts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Omega-3 fatty acids are critical for neuropsychological functioning. Adolescence is increasingly believed to entail brain vulnerability to dietary intake. The potential benefit on adolescent neurodevelopment of consuming walnuts, a source of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a 6-month multi-school-based randomised controlled nutrition intervention trial to assess whether walnut consumption has beneficial effects on the neuropsychological and behavioural development of adolescents. The study took place between 04/01/2016 and 06/30/2017 in twelve different high schools in Barcelona, Spain (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02590848). A total of 771 healthy teenagers aged 11-16 years were randomised into two equal groups (intervention or control). The intervention group received 30 g/day of raw walnut kernels to be incorporated into their diet for 6 months. Multiple primary endpoints concerning neuropsychological (working memory, attention, fluid intelligence, and executive function) and behavioural (socio-emotional and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] symptoms) development were assessed at baseline and after intervention. Red blood cell (RBC) ALA status was determined at baseline and 6 months as a measure of compliance. Main analyses were based on intention-to-treat using a linear mixed-effects model. A per-protocol effect of the intervention was analysed using inverse-probability weighting to account for post-randomisation prognostic factors (including adherence) using generalised estimating equations. FINDINGS: In intention-to-treat analyses, at 6 months there were no statistically significant changes between the intervention and control groups for all primary endpoints. RBC ALA (%) significantly increased only in the intervention group, coefficient = 0.04 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.03, 0.06; p < 0.0001). The per-protocol (adherence-adjusted) effect on improvement in attention score (hit reaction time variability) was -11.26 ms (95% CI = -19.92, -2.60; p = 0.011) for the intervention group as compared to the control group, improvement in fluid intelligence score was 1.78 (95% CI = 0.90, 2.67; p < 0.0001), and reduction of ADHD symptom score was -2.18 (95% CI = -3.70, -0.67; p = 0.0050). INTERPRETATION: Our study suggested that being prescribed eating walnuts for 6 months did not improve the neuropsychological function of healthy adolescents. However, improved sustained attention, fluid intelligence, and ADHD symptoms were observed in participants who better complied with the walnut intervention. This study provides a foundation for further clinical and epidemiological research on the effect of walnuts and ALA on neurodevelopment in adolescents. FUNDING: This study was supported by Instituto de Salud Carlos III through the projects 'CP14/00108, PI16/00261, PI21/00266' (co-funded by European Union Regional Development Fund 'A way to make Europe'). The California Walnut Commission (CWC) has given support by supplying the walnuts for free for the Walnuts Smart Snack Dietary Intervention Trial."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tissue levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been inversely related with risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Whether ratios of n-3 to n-6 PUFAs, reflecting both dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs and competing n-6 PUFAs, are better predictors of future MI than n-3 PUFA fractions is unclear. We aimed at investigating whether such ratios in adipose tissue better predict MI than n-3 PUFA fractions. METHODS: Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained in a random sample (n = 3,500) of the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort (n = 57,053). Adipose tissue content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid was determined using gas chromatography. Fractions of selected n-3 PUFAs and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios were correlated to the 15-year occurrence of MI in a case-cohort design. RESULTS: A total of 2,406 participants experienced an MI during follow-up. Adipose tissue total marine n-3 PUFAs, EPA+DHA, EPA, EPA/AA, DHA/AA and (EPA + DPA + DHA)/AA were all inversely associated with risk of incident MI. Evaluating the predictive power (Harrel's C-index) of the selected metrics, fractions of marine n-3 PUFAs and ratios of EPA/AA, DHA/AA, (EPA + DHA)/AA and (EPA + DPA + DHA)/AA all refined risk prediction over age and sex alone. At multivariable analyses, however, the above ratios were the only metrics providing additional risk prediction. Differences in ratios were related to differences in food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Both adipose tissue n-3 PUFAs fractions and ratios of n-3 PUFAs/AA were associated with a lower occurrence of MI, but ratios provided superior risk prediction. Dietary strategies affecting n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios should be further investigated for prediction of MI with dietary interventions at the population level and in intervention studies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Observational studies demonstrated controversial effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on Parkinson's disease (PD) with limited causality evidence. Randomized control trials showed possible improvement in PD symptoms with PUFA supplement but had small study population and limited intervention time. METHODS: A two-sample Mendelian randomization was designed to evaluate the causal relevance between PUFAs and PD, using genetic variants of PUFAs as instrumental variables and PD data from the largest genome-wide association study as outcome. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was applied to obtain the primary outcome. Mendelian randomization Egger regression, weighted median and weighted mode methods were exploited to assist result analyses. Strict Mendelian randomization and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) were used to estimate direct effects of PUFAs on PD, eliminating pleiotropic effect. Debiased inverse variance weighted estimator was implemented when weak instrument bias was introduced into the analysis. A variety of sensitivity analyses were utilized to assess validity of the results. RESULTS: Our study included 33,674 PD cases and 449,056 controls. Higher plasma level of arachidonic acid (AA) was associated with a 3% increase of PD risk per 1-standard deviation (SD) increase of AA (IVW; Odds ratio (OR)=1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.04], P = 2.24E-04). After MVMR (IVW; OR=1.03 [95% CI 1.02-1.04], P =6.15E-08) and deletion of pleiotropic single-nucleotide polymorphisms overlapping with other lipids (IVW; OR=1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.05], P =5.88E-04), result was still significant. Increased level of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) showed possible relevance with increased PD risk after adjustment of pleiotropy (MVMR; OR=1.05 [95% CI 1.01-1.08], P =5.40E-03). Linoleic acid (LA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) were found not causally relevant to PD risk. Various sensitivity analyses verified the validity of our results. In conclusion, our findings from Mendelian randomization suggested that elevated levels of AA and possibly EPA might be linked to a higher risk of PD. No association between PD risk and LA, DHA, DPA, or ALA was found. DISCUSSION: The odds ratio for plasma AA and PD risk was weak. It is important to approach our results with caution in clinical practice and to conduct additional studies on the relationship between PUFAs and PD risk."

The quality of C. oleifera oil (tea oil) is mainly determined by the contents of linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA). However, how to increase the contents of LA and ALA in tea oil and the corresponding regulating mechanism have not been clarified. In the present study, we found that the LA and ALA contents in C. oleifera seeds were significant positively associated with the concentrations of ethephon and were decreased by ethylene inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, 1.5 g L-1 ethephon could receive an optimal LA and ALA contents without adverse effects to the growth of 'Huashuo' trees in this study. The ethephon treatment also increased the contents of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), sucrose, soluble sugar and reducing sugar contents in seeds. Transcriptome analysis further suggested that exogenous ethephon application enhanced the accumulation of LA and ALA via regulating genes involved in LA and ALA metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction pathways, and starch and sucrose metabolism. Our findings confirm the role of ethylene in LA and ALA regulation and provide new insights into the potential utilization of ethylene as a LA and ALA inducer in C. oleifera cultivation."

This prospective study aimed to examine the effect of hindmilk, the milk at the end of a breast expression session, on growth and plasma fatty acids (FAs) of infants born <30 weeks' gestation who had been on full enteral feeds for ≥2 weeks and had a weight gain of <15 g/kg/day despite optimizing energy and protein intakes. Weight and plasma FAs were assessed before and two weeks after feeding hindmilk. Growth anthropometrics were assessed weekly for four weeks. Paired t-tests and multiple linear regression were used for statistical analyses of data from 34 infants and their 29 mothers. There was a significant increase in weight gain in the two weeks after feeding hindmilk (MD 3.9, 95%CI 1.2-6.5 g/kg/day). Weight Z-scores were larger at two weeks (MD 0.61, 95%CI 0.02-1.20) and onwards. Head circumference Z-scores were larger at three weeks (MD 0.83, 95%CI 0.20-1.47) and onwards. Plasma linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) increased after feeding hindmilk. In conclusion, hindmilk may improve weight and head growth and increase LA and ALA in very preterm infants with suboptimal growth.

      "abstract": "Inflammation is an important risk factor for bone-destroying diseases. Our preliminary research found that Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (ZBSO) is abundant in unsaturated fatty acids and could inhibit osteoclastogenesis in receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-induced RAW264.7 cells. However, the key constituents in ZBSO in the prevention of osteoclastogenesis and its possible mechanism related to inflammation are still unclear. Therefore, in this study, oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), palmitoleic acid (PLA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in ZBSO, havingthe strongest effect on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, were selected by a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining method. Furthermore, the effects of the selected fatty acids on anti-inflammation and anti-osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo were assessed using RT-qPCR. Among the four major unsaturated fatty acids we tested, ALA displayed the strongest inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis. The increased expression of free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) and β-arrestin2 (βarr2), as well as the decreased expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in RAW264.7 cells after ALA treatment were observed. Moreover, in ovariectomized osteoporotic rats with ALA preventive intervention, we found that the expression of TNF-α, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), NFATc1, and TRAP were decreased, while with the ALA therapeutic intervention, downregulated expression of NF-κB, NFATc1, TRAP, and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) were noticed. These results indicate that ALA, as the major unsaturated fatty acid in ZBSO, could inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis via the FFAR4/βarr2 signaling pathway and could prevent inflammation, suggesting that ZBSO may be a promising potential natural product of unsaturated fatty acids and a dietary supplement for the prevention of osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory diseases."

For that purpose, fish (body weight of 90 g) were intraperitoneally (IP) injected (time 0 h) with five long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, namely, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:5n3); eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:4n3); α-linolenic (ALA; C18:3n3); linoleic acid (LA; C18:2n6) and oleic acid (OA; C18:1n9) at a dose of 300 μg kg-1, or with 0.9% saline solution (control). Feed intake (FI) was recorded at 3, 6, and 24 h after the IP injection. One week later, fish were IP injected with the same FA, and the hypothalamus was collected 3 h after the IP injection for measurement of molecules related to FI regulation and FA-sensing mechanisms. Cumulative FI (g/kg/day) was not affected by treatments. However, compared to the control, FI increased with the OA treatment at 6 h after the IP injection. FI decreased with mealtime in the DHA and LA groups. Gene expression of orexigenic (npy/agrp) and anorexigenic (cart2/pomc1) neurons was not affected by the FA treatments. Attending the enzymes involved in the FA-sensing mechanisms activation, compared to the control carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) and ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) activity were not affected by FA treatments. Contrarily the key enzymes of lipid metabolisms, malic enzyme and hydroxyacylCoA dehydrogenase was higher in fish that received the EPA and OA treatment, than fish treated to the control. Overall, the results of the present study indicate that gene expression of orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons was not affected at 3 h after IP injection with different FA. However, the activity of key enzymes of lipid metabolism was differently affected by circulating FA, indicating that FA-sensing mechanisms respond to different FA. Further studies are required involving different sampling times to further characterize the response of FA-sensing mechanisms to FA. These findings may be of relevance to the aquaculture industry in an era where alternative lipid sources are being increasingly used.",

      "abstract": "Objective. The intent of the present study was to test two hypotheses. The primary hypothesis was that there would be differences between blood serum individual free fatty acids (SIFFA) and serum individual total fatty acids (SITFA) in terms of their different relationships (correlations) to each of homeostatic model assessment-individual insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and homeostatic model assessment-individual insulin resistance-percentage β-cell function (HOMA-% β) remaining in human type 2 diabetic patients with pre-flaxseed oil (FXO) and pre-safflower oil (SFO) administration. The secondary hypothesis was that FXO (rich in alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) supplementation would alter these correlations differently in the SIFFA and STIFFA pools in comparison with the placebo SFO (poor in ALA). Methods. Patients were recruited via a newspaper advertisement and two physicians. All patients came to visit 1 and three months later to visit 2. At visit 2, the subjects were randomly assigned (double-blind) to flaxseed or safflower oil (placebo) treatment for three months until visit 3. Results. There were pre-intervention differences in the SIFFA and STIFA pool's relationships with each of HOMA-IR and HOMA-% β. These relatioships remained either unchanged or became significant after intervention (treatment or placebo). There was a negative correlation found between HOMA-IR and serum free ALA (SFALA) mol % after FXO. Serum total ALA (STALA) mol % had no significant correlations with HOMA-IR and HOMA- % β before and after flaxseed oil administration. Conclusions. The SIFFA and SITFA pools have different relationships with HOMA-IR and HOMA-% β for each of pre- and post-intervention. It is concluded that the data support both the primary and the secondary hypotheses indicating that they are correct.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The majority of the population do not consume adequate omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA), leading to global deficiencies, as evidenced by poor omega-3 status. An indicator of overall n-3 FA status, omega3-index (O3i) ≥8% has been associated with reduced risk of chronic disease, most notably cardiovascular disease. Thus, a synthesis of current research summarizing the effects of n-3 FA intake on O3i is warranted to develop and refine clinical recommendations. The purpose of this scoping review was to evaluate the effect of n-3 FA interventions and estimate sufficient n-3 FA intake to improve O3i to meet recommendations. METHODS: Search criteria were human studies published in English from 2004 to 2022 that assessed O3i at baseline and following an n-3 FA intervention. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies that met inclusion criteria were identified. Protocols included fish consumption, fortified foods, combined eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplements, supplements of single n-3 FA (alpha linolenic acid (ALA), EPA, DHA, etc.), and supplements providing multiple n-3 FA. Dietary supplements varied in chemical composition; the most common were triglycerides or ethyl esters. The lowest supplementation protocol was 100 mg/d, and the largest was 4,400 mg/d EPA and DHA. Supplementation time period ranged from 3 weeks to 1 year. At baseline, three study samples had mean O3i >8%, although many intervention protocols successfully increased O3i. DISCUSSION: Generally, the lowest doses shown to be effective in raising O3i to recommended levels were >1,000 mg/d of combination DHA plus EPA for 12 weeks or longer. Supplements composed of triglycerides were more bioavailable and thus more effective than other formulas. Based on the data evaluated, practical recommendations to improve O3i to ≥8% are consumption of 1,000-1,500 mg/d EPA plus DHA as triglycerides for at least 12 weeks."

      "abstract": "The effects of rice bran oil (RBO) as an alternative dietary energy source on nutritional properties and fatty acid deposition in broiler chickens are scarce in the literature. One-day-old chickens (broiler Ross 308) were assigned in a completely randomized design with three treatment diets and nine replicates of four chickens per replicate. A basal control diet contained 4~5% palm oil (T1) in the starter and finisher phases, respectively. Treatments 2 to 3 were fed diets formulated with 50% (T2) and 100% (T3) of RBO as a fat source instead of palm oil (PO). Replacing dietary PO with RBO improved the feed conversion ratio (FCR) by 6% (p = 0.017) over the total period of the experiment (1−38 d of age). The feeding of RBO (T3) showed the highest (p < 0.001) cooking loss values in the breast meat. However, compared with other groups, the blend of PO and RBO group (T2) displayed a lower cooking loss value in the thigh meat. In breast meat, the protein content was lowered (p = 0.007), while the fat content was higher (p < 0.001) in male broiler chickens fed dietary RBO (T2 and T3). Total inclusion of dietary RBO (T3) decreased (p = 0.034) the proportion of saturated fatty acids (ΣSFAs) but increased (p = 0.02) linoleic acid. In addition, α-linolenic acid (ALA) increased (p < 0.001) in male broiler chickens fed dietary RBO (T2 and T3), and the highest deposit level occurred by the total inclusion of RBO (T3). Total omega 3 fatty acids (∑n-3) increased (p = 0.013), while the ratio of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) decreased (p = 0.046) in male broiler chickens fed dietary RBO (T3) as compared with the control diet (PO; T1). In conclusion, compared with dietary PO (control diet, T1), the total inclusion of dietary RBO at 50 kg/metric ton feed (T3) increased ∑n-3, ALA, and reduced n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio in the breast meat, but cooking loss values were larger in breast and thigh meats. The blend of dietary PO and RBO (T2) was better for both production performance targets (feed intake and FCR), cooking loss values, and deposition of ALA in the breast meat. The inclusion of dietary RBO into broiler diets needs further study, but the present experiment aids in expanding research knowledge to make that possible."

However, the effect of dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency on pancreatic injury and whether the supplementation of n-3 PUFA could prevent the development of pancreatic injury are still not clear. In the present study, an n-3 PUFA deficiency mouse model was established by feeding them with n-3 PUFA deficiency diets for 30 days. Results showed that n-3 PUFA deficiency aggravated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced pancreas injury by reducing the insulin level by 18.21% and the HOMA β-cell indices by 31.13% and the area of islet by 52.58% compared with the STZ group. Moreover, pre-intervention with DHA and EPA for 15 days could alleviate STZ-induced pancreas damage by increasing the insulin level by 55.26% and 44.33%, the HOMA β-cell indices by 118.81% and 157.26% and reversed the area of islet by 196.75% and 205.57% compared to the n-3 Def group, and the effects were significant compared to γ-linolenic acid (GLA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) treatment. The possible underlying mechanisms indicated that EPA and DHA significantly reduced the ration of n-6 PUFA to n-3 PUFA and then inhibited oxidative stress, inflammation and islet β-cell apoptosis levels in pancreas tissue. The results might provide insights into the prevention and alleviation of pancreas injury by dietary intervention with PUFAs and provide a theoretical basis for their application in functional foods.",

      "abstract": "Toad venom, a dried product of secretion from Bufo bufo gargarizans Cantor or Bufo melanostictus Schneider, has had the therapeutic effects of hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed. Bufalin and cinobufagin were considered as the two most representative antitumor active components in toad venom. However, the underlying mechanisms of this antitumor effect have not been fully implemented, especially the changes in endogenous small molecules after treatment. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the intrinsic mechanism on hepatocellular carcinoma after the cotreatment of bufalin and cinobufagin based on untargeted tumor metabolomics. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was performed to identify the absorbed components of toad venom in rat plasma. In vitro experiments were determined to evaluate the therapeutic effects of bufalin and cinobufagin and screen the optimal ratio between them. An in vivo HepG2 tumor-bearing nude mice model was established, and a series of pharmacodynamic indicators were determined, including the body weight of mice, tumor volume, tumor weight, and histopathological examination of tumor. Further, the entire metabolic alterations in tumor after treating with bufalin and cinobufagin were also profiled by UHPLC-MS/MS. Twenty-seven active components from toad venom were absorbed in rat plasma. We found that the cotreatment of bufalin and cinobufagin exerted significant antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, which were reflected in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of HepG2 cells and thereby causing cell necrosis. After cotherapy of bufalin and cinobufagin for twenty days, compared with the normal group, fifty-six endogenous metabolites were obviously changed on HepG2 tumor-bearing nude mice. Meanwhile, the abundance of α-linolenic acid and phenethylamine after the bufalin and cinobufagin intervention was significantly upregulated, which involved phenylalanine metabolism and α-linolenic acid metabolism. Furthermore, we noticed that amino acid metabolites were also altered in HepG2 tumor after drug intervention, such as norvaline and Leu-Ala. Taken together, the cotreatment of bufalin and cinobufagin has significant antitumor effects on HepG2 tumor-bearing nude mice. Our work demonstrated that the in-depth mechanism of antitumor activity was mainly through the regulation of phenylalanine metabolism and α-Linolenic acid metabolism.",

As Lacticaseibacillus casei ATCC334 potentially affects microbial ecosystem, the study hypothesizes that it may improve radiation-induced intestinal injury in rats by modulating the \"gut microbiota-metabolite-barrier axis.\" METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats are fed one of three or no doses of L. casei ATCC334 for 7 days and then expose to a single dose of 9 Gy X-ray total abdominal irradiation. Supplementation with L. casei ATCC334 promote the proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), increase the expression of tight junction proteins, reduce intestinal permeability, and protect intestinal barrier integrity. Moreover, 16S rRNA sequencing show that medium and high doses of L. casei ATCC334 inhibit the growth of Escherichia/Shigella and favor Akkermansia proliferation. L. casei ATCC334 intervention reprogram the metabolic profile and inhibit putrescine production but promote alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) production. Notably, a decrease in putrescine and an increase in ALA are significantly correlated with the proliferation of ISCs and enhanced intestinal barrier function following L. casei ATCC334 intervention. CONCLUSION: These results highlight that medium and high doses of L. casei ATCC334 alleviate radiation-induced intestinal damage by enhancing the mucosal barrier and remodeling the gut microbiota structure and metabolic activity.",

We investigated the interactions between dietary PUFAs and FADS1 rs174550 variant. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants (n = 118), homozygous for FADS1 rs174550 variant (TT and CC) followed a high alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 5 percent of energy (E-%)) or a high linoleic acid (LA, 10 E-%) diet during an 8-week randomized controlled intervention. Fatty acid composition of plasma lipids and PUFA-derived lipid mediators were quantified by gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. The high-LA diet increased the concentration of plasma LA, but not its lipid mediators. The concentration of plasma arachidonic acid decreased in carriers of CC and remained unchanged in the TT genotype. The high-ALA diet increased the concentration of plasma ALA and its cytochrome P450-derived epoxides and dihydroxys, and cyclooxygenase-derived monohydroxys. Concentrations of plasma eicosapentaenoic acid and its mono- and dihydroxys increased only in TT genotype carriers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential for genotype-based recommendations for PUFA consumption, resulting in modulation of bioactive lipid mediators which can exert beneficial effects in maintaining health.",

Natural herbal compounds are considered the primary source of active agents with the potential to prevent or treat inflammatory-related pathologies such as CVD and diabetes. Flaxseed contains phytochemicals, including secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), α-linolenic acid (ALA), and lignans, termed \"SAL.\" Hence, we evaluated the effect of the SAL on the H9c2 cardiac cells in hyperlipidemic and hyperglycemic conditions. Here, candidate hub genes, TNF-α, IL6, SIRT1, NRF1, NPPA, and FGF7, were selected as effective genes in diabetic cardiovascular pathogenesis based on in-silico analysis and chemoinformatic. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced using H9c2 cardiac cells in hyperlipidemic and hyperglycemic conditions. Real-time qPCR was conducted to assess the expression level of hub genes. This study indicated that SAL compounds bound to the Il-6, SIRT1, and TNF-α active sites as druggable candidate proteins based on the chemoinformatics analysis. This study displayed that the TNF-α, IL6, SIRT1, NRF1, NPPA, and FGF7 network dysfunction in MI models were ameliorated by SAL consumption. Furthermore, SAL compounds improved the function and myogenesis of H9c2 cells in hyperlipidemic and hyperglycemic conditions. Our data suggested that phytochemicals obtained from flaxseed might have proposed potential complementary treatment or preventive strategies for MI. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Phytochemicals obtained from flaxseed (SAL) could reverse diabetic heart dysfunction hallmarks and provide new potential treatment approaches in cardiovascular therapy. SAL could be considered complementary and alternative medicines for treating various disorders/diseases singly or synchronizing with prescription drugs.",

Recent studies have shown the antitumor potential of active biological phytochemical structures of flavonoids for the prevention and treatment of cancerous cells. In this study, two quercetin fatty acid esters (α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA)) compounds were evaluated in terms of inducing apoptotic human melanoma cells (A375) death in vitro. MAIN METHODS: The MTT assay was utilized for comparing the effects of quercetin, ALA, and LA on A375 cell viability concentrations of 5, 25, 35, 50, and 100μg/mL for 24 and 48 h to obtain IC50. To detect the effects on apoptosis and to determine p-ERK/ERK apoptosis-related signaling pathway proteins level, flow-cytometry and western blot were used. Finally, the nano-mechanical properties of the melanoma A375 membrane structure containing elastic modulus value and cell-cell adhesion forces were investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Statistical data was analyzed in GraphPad v.8.0.0. KEY FINDINGS: The most significant A375 cell viability amplified effect of Q-LA was observed with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 35 μg/mL, 48 h), proportional to dose. Ester compounds, especially Q-LA, showed the highest cell proliferation inhibition with improved elastic modulus, cell-cell adhesion forces (253 ± 11.2), and elevated apoptosis-inducing effect (p < 0.01**). Moreover, Q-LA significantly decreased the mean levels of p-ERK phosphorylation (0.1439) and, subsequently, apoptosis in A375 cells. SIGNIFICANCE: The data presented in this study confirmed the antitumor activity of ester compounds against A375 cells, high-lighting the ability of the tested compounds to induce apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "α-Linolenic acid (ALA) is a natural essential fatty acid widely found in plant seed oils and beans, which shows positive anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects. In our previous study, ALA was proven to bind tightly to the seven protein targets closely associated with allergic rhinitis (AR) by molecular docking, which indicates that ALA may have a potential role in the treatment of AR. A mouse model of AR induced by ovalbumin (OVA) was adopted in this study to explore the therapeutical effect and potential mechanism of ALA in treating AR. Results demonstrated that ALA remarkably relieved the nasal symptoms, reduced the OVA-sIgE level in the serum, relieved the histopathological injuries, and downregulated the mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and IL-1β in the nasal mucosa. ALA also remarkably moderated the imbalance of Th1/Th2 cells, increased the mRNA expression levels of T-bet and STAT1, and reduced GATA3 and STAT6. ALA was proven to have a substantial therapeutic effect on mice with AR, and the underlying mechanism was likely to be the regulation of Th1/Th2 imbalance through the JAK/T-bet/STAT1 and JAK/GATA3/STAT6 pathways. This study provides a specific experimental basis for the clinical use and drug development of ALA in the treatment of AR.",

      "abstract": "The reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are produced during storage of boar semen are causing oxidative stress and leads to poor fertility. Also, tropical and sub-tropical weather condition adversely impacts the physicomorphological quality and fertility of boar sperm. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of feeding linseed oil to boar on its seminal attributes, sperm kinetics, biomarkers of antioxidant, fatty acid profile of seminal plasma (SP) and sperm and in vivo fertility. Six Hampshire crossbreed boars were fed with 90 ml linseed oil (LIN) whereas six Hampshire crossbreed boars were fed 90 ml canola oil (CON) for 16 weeks. Sperm quality was evaluated (60 ejaculates for each group; a total of 120 ejaculates) for motility, livability, abnormal morphology, acrosomal membrane integrity, hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) and sperm kinetic parameters by computer assisted semen analysis (CASA) at 0 h and at 72 h of storage at 17°C. Biomarkers of antioxidant (glutathione peroxidase; GPx, catalase; CAT, total antioxidant capacity; TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in SP and serum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for the estimation of fatty acid composition of SP and sperm. Boars fed with linseed oil had higher semen volume (p < .01) and more total sperm numbers (p < .01). Feeding linseed oil to boar enhanced seminal attributes (p < .05) at 0 h as well as at 72 h of storage. Linseed oil feeding (p < .01) improved biomarkers of antioxidants and significantly (p < .01) lowered the lipid peroxidation in serum and SP. Linseed oil feeding (p < .05) increased the proportion of alpha linolenic (ALA), arachidonic and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids in SP. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids in sperm increased significantly (p < .01) in treatment group. Farrowing rate was significantly (p < .05) higher in treatment group. In conclusion, feeding linseed oil to boar improved the in vivo fertility, enhanced antioxidant capacity and increased the DHA content of SP and sperm.",

      "abstract": "The current study employed the high-fat diet (HFD) induced murine model to assess the relationship between the effect of Jian Pi Tiao Gan Yin (JPTGY) and the alterations of gut microbiota and fecal metabolism. C57BL/6 mice were used to establish an animal model of obesity via HFD induce. Serum biochemical indicators of lipid metabolism were used to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of JPTGY in obese mice. Bacterial communities and metabolites in the feces specimens from the controls, the Group HFD, and the JPTGY-exposed corpulency group were studied by 16s rDNA genetic sequence in combination with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based untargeted fecal metabolomics techniques. Results revealed that JPTGY significantly decreased the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, JPTGY could up-regulate the abundance and diversity of fecal microbiota, which was characterized by the higher phylum of proteobacteria. Consistently, at the genus levels, JPTGY supplementation induced enrichments in Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Oscillibacter, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, and Intestinimonas, which were intimately related to 14 pivotal fecal metabolins in respond to JPTGY therapy were determined. What is more, metabolomics further analyses show that the therapeutic effect of JPTGY for obesity involves linoleic acid (LA) metabolism paths, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) metabolism paths, glycerophospholipid metabolism paths, arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism paths, and pyrimidine metabolism paths, which implied the potential mechanism of JPTGY in treating obesity. It was concluded that the linking of corpulency phenotypes with intestinal flora and fecal metabolins unveils the latent causal link of JPTGY in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and obesity."

      "abstract": "Omega-3 fatty acids are critical for brain function. Adolescence is increasingly believed to entail brain vulnerability to dietary intake. In contrast to the abundant research on the omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in cognition, research on DHA and attention in healthy adolescents is scarce. In addition, the role of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the vegetable omega-3 fatty acid, is unexplored. We examined associations between DHA and ALA and attention function among a healthy young population. In this cross-sectional study conducted in 372 adolescents (13.8 ± 0.9 years-old), we determined the red blood cell proportions of DHA and ALA by gas chromatography (objective biomarkers of their long-term dietary intake) and measured attention scores through the Attention Network Test. We constructed multivariable linear regression models to analyze associations, controlling for known confounders. Compared to participants at the lowest DHA tertile (reference), those at the highest DHA tertile showed significantly lower hit reaction time-standard error (higher attentiveness) (28.13 ms, 95% confidence interval [CI] =  - 52.30;  - 3.97), lower hit reaction time ( - 38.30 ms, 95% CI =  - 73.28;  - 3.33) and lower executive conflict response ( - 5.77 ms, 95% CI =  - 11.44;  - 0.09). In contrast, higher values were observed in those at the top tertile of ALA in hit reaction time compared to the lowest one (46.14 ms, 95% CI = 9.90; 82.34). However, a beneficial association was observed for ALA, with decreasing impulsivity index across tertiles. Overall, our results suggest that DHA (reflecting its dietary intake) is associated with attention performance in typically developing adolescents. The role of dietary ALA in attention is less clear, although higher blood levels of ALA appear to result in lower impulsivity. Future intervention studies are needed to determine the causality of these associations and to better shape dietary recommendations for brain health during the adolescence period.",

The study aimed to assess the effect of essential fatty acids (EFAs) against biofilm formation and mature biofilms of C. albicans strains, which were isolated from vulvovaginal candidiasis and candidemia. METHODS: The biofilm formation ability of C. albicans and antifungal activities of fluconazole were determined. Additionally, the effects of six EFAs [α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), linoleic acid (LOA), γ-linolenic acid (GLA), and arachidonic acid (AA)] against C. albicans under planktonic and biofilm conditions were evaluated. RESULTS: 94.1% of C. albicans exhibited biofilm formation capacity, and 98.5% of C. albicans were susceptible to fluconazole. The biofilms of C. albicans were highly resistant to fluconazole with minimum biofilm eradication concentration values ≥ 64 µg/mL. The EFAs attenuated biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner, and GLA displayed a remarkable inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of C. albicans. In addition, EPA, DHA, and GLA at 0.1 mM could inhibit the biofilm formation of C. albicans without affecting the planktonic growth rate. Notably, EPA and AA at 1 mM had both inhibitory and eradication activities on C. albicans biofilms. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to directly compare different EFAs for their capacity to affect C. albicans biofilm formation as well as biofilm eradication. These results suggest EPA and AA could serve as potential new antifungal agents for the treatment of clinical infections caused by C. albicans biofilms."

      "abstract": "The content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in complex lipids essentially influences their physicochemical properties and has been linked to health and disease. To investigate the incorporation of dietary PUFA in the human plasma lipidome, we quantified glycerophospholipids (GPL), sphingolipids, and sterols using electrospray ionization coupled to tandem mass spectrometry of plasma samples obtained from a dietary intervention study. Healthy individuals received foods supplemented with different vegetable oils rich in PUFA. These included sunflower, linseed, echium, and microalgae oil as sources of linoleic acid (LA; FA 18:2 n-6), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; FA 18:3 n-3), stearidonic acid (SDA; FA 18:4 n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; FA 22:6 n-3). While LA and ALA did not influence the species profiles of GPL, sphingolipid, and cholesteryl ester drastically, SDA and DHA were integrated primarily in ethanolamine-containing GPL. This significantly altered phosphatidylethanolamine and plasmalogen species composition, especially those with 38-40 carbons and 6 double bonds. We speculate that diets enriched with highly unsaturated FA more efficiently alter plasma GPL acyl chain composition than those containing primarily di- and tri-unsaturated FA, most likely because of their more pronounced deviation of FA composition from typical western diets.",

Thirty Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. Cows were fed a total mixed ration without flaxseed (CK), 1500 g of whole flaxseed (WF), and 1500 g of ground flaxseed (GF) supplementation. There were no differences observed in dry matter intake, milk yield, energy-corrected milk, and 4% fat-corrected milk (p > 0.05). Compared with the CK group, the contents of α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosatrienoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid increased in the plasma and milk WF and GF groups, and the content of docosahexaenoic acid and total n-3 PUFA was higher in GF than the other groups (p < 0.001). The ALA yield increased to 232% and 360% in WF and GF, respectively, compared to the CK group. Compared with the WF group, GF supplementation resulted in an increased milk ALA/ALA intake ratio (p < 0.001). Flaxseed supplementation increased the activity of GSH-Px and decreased the concentration of MDA in milk (p < 0.001). Plasma parameters did not differ among the treatments (p > 0.05). This result indicated that compared with the WF group, GF supplementation in the diet showed higher efficiency in increasing the total n-3 PUFA levels and the milk ALA/ALA intake ratio, and decreased the ratio of n-6 PUFAs to n-3 PUFAs in milk."

      "abstract": "The essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is present in high amounts in oils such as flaxseed, soy, hemp, rapeseed, chia, and perilla, while stearidonic acid is abundant in echium oil. ALA is metabolized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by desaturases and elongases in humans. The conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is limited, and these long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are mainly provided from dietary sources (fish and seafood). This review provides an overview of studies that explored the effects of dietary supplementation with ALA in obesity and related diseases. The obesity-associated changes of desaturase and elongase activities are summarized, as they could influence the metabolic conversion of ALA. Generally, supplementation with ALA or ALA-rich oils leads to an increase in EPA levels and has no effect on DHA or omega-3 index. According to the literature data, stearidonic acid could enhance conversion of ALA to long-chain n-3 PUFA in obesity. Recent studies confirm that EPA and DHA intake should be considered as a primary dietary treatment strategy for improving the omega-3 index in obesity and related diseases.",

As an adjuvant of chemotherapeutic agents, LO and other ALA-rich vegetable oils have been studied in only a handful of studies at the experimental level. However, the efficacy of antitumoral therapy using doxorubicin (Dox) in combination with ALA and ALA-rich substrates has not yet been investigated. In this work, the antitumor activity of LO in a wide dose range was studied with monotherapy and combined with Dox in animal models with Pliss lymphosarcoma (PLS) and Lewis lung adenocarcinoma (LLC). It was founded the daily oral administration of LO (1, 3, and 10 ml per 1 kg) to rats (PLS) and 6 ml/kg to mice (LLC) for 11-12 days from 7 days after subcutaneous transplantation of tumors has a stable statistically significant effect on the dynamics of tumor growth, reducing the intensity of tumor growth and increasing the frequency of complete tumor regressions (CR) compared with the control. LO showed high antimetastatic activity in the LLC model. Furthermore, LO at a dose of 3 ml/kg potentiates the antitumor effect of Dox in the PLS model, reducing the volume of tumors at the end of treatment by 2.0 times (p = 0.013), the value of the tumor growth index by 1.6 times (p < 0.03) and increasing the frequency of CR 60 days after the start of therapy by 3.5 times (p = 0.019) compared with the use of Dox alone. The combination of Dox and LO or fish oil allows growing efficiency therapy of LLC in comparison with Dox alone, increasing the frequency of CR to 73.68% and 94.4%, respectively, and reducing the frequency of metastasis to zero."

The present study aimed to examine the heat stress alleviating effects of dietary linseed oil on semen quality and antioxidant status of boar, in the summer and winter seasons in sub-tropical climate. Six Hampshire crossbreed boars were fed with 90 mL linseed oil (treatment) whereas six boars of the same breed were fed 90 mL vegetable oil (control) for sixteen weeks during both season. Sperm quality was assessed for motility, viability, abnormality, acrosomal integrity, and Hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST). Sperm velocity attributes were assessed by computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). Antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase; GPx, catalase; CAT, total antioxidant capacity; TAC and nitric oxide; NO) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde; MDA) were measured in seminal plasma and serum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for the estimation of fatty acid composition of seminal plasma and spermatozoa. Feeding linseed oil to the boars significantly (p < 0.05) improved sperm quality at the fresh stage and after 72 h of liquid storage in both season. There was a significant (p < 0.01) effect of treatment and season on semen quality parameters. Significant boar (p < 0.05) effect was recorded on reaction time, semen volume, sperm abnormality, acrosomal integrity and HOST reactive sperm.

Linseed oil supplementation significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced antioxidant and lowered MDA levels in serum as well as seminal plasma. The concentration of alpha-linolenic (ALA), arachidonic and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids were significantly (p < 0.01) increased in seminal plasma and sperm after linseed oil supplementation. In conclusion, linseed oil supplementation to boar during high THI months improved the semen quality parameters viz. semen volume, sperm concentration, and progressive motile sperm, along with enhanced antioxidant capacity.",

Herein, we present a 12-month, randomised, double-blind, parallel-armed intervention trial examining the effects of PO supplementation alone or in combination with A. cordifolia leaf powder on brain function in healthy elderly Japanese individuals. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: the PO group received 1.47 mL PO (0.88 g ALA) daily via soft gelatine capsules, and the POAC group received 1.47 mL PO and 1.12 g A. cordifolia leaf powder (1.46 mg vitexin and 1.12 mg adenosine) daily. After 12 months of intervention, the POAC group showed generally higher cognitive index scores than the PO group. The beneficial effects of combined supplementation on cognitive function were associated with increased ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid levels in red blood cell plasma membranes, increased serum biological antioxidant potential, and decreased serum triglyceride, glucose, and N-(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), an advanced glycation end-product and biochemical marker of oxidative stress levels. The effects of combined supplementation on cognitive function also showed a significant negative correlation with serum CML levels after 12 months of intervention. Our findings suggest that combined long-term supplementation with PO and A. cordifolia more effectively ameliorates age-related cognitive decline than PO alone. These findings may serve as a basis for the development of new supplements for brain health. Clinical Trial Registry, UMIN000040863.",

      "abstract": "The present study evaluated the effect of supplementation alpha-linolenic fatty acid source (ALA) with different rumen undegradable to degradable protein ratios [low ratio (LR) = 26:74; high ratio (HR) = 36:64 based on CP%] on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal score, animal feeding behavior, and urinary purine derivatives (PD) in young lambs during hot season. Forty 10-day-old lambs (averaging body weight of 7.9 ± 0.8 kg) were used in a completely randomized block design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement as following treatments (10 lambs/treatment): (1) no n-3 FA supplementation with LR diet (NALA-LR), (2) no ALA supplementation with HR diet (NALA-HR), (3) supplementation of ALA with LR diet (ALA-LR), and (4) supplementation of ALA with HR diet (ALA-HR). Results showed that ALA supplementation slightly increased feed efficiency (FE; tendency, P = 0.076), improved fecal score (P = 0.045), and reduced rectal temperature (tendency, P = 0.064) during pre-weaning period. The HR diets improved average daily gain (ADG; P < 0.01), wither height (post-weaning; P = 0.015), and final BW (P = 0.048) compared with LR diets. The greatest ADG (pre-weaning; P = 0.012), structural growth, and the lowest urinary nitrogen exertion (P = 0.043) were found in the ALA-HR treatment. No change was found for ruminal fermentation, nutrient digestibility, and animal behavior in lambs fed different experimental treatments. In summary, results indicated that concurrent feeding of ALA and high dietary RUP:RDP ratio can be recommendable that is likely due to more efficient nitrogen utilization when young lambs are raised during hot season. HIGHLIGHTS: • The interaction of n-3 FA and nitrogen was evaluated in pre-weaning lambs raised under heat condition. • Supplementation of n-3 FA increased FE and improved fecal score in heat-exposed lambs during pre-weaning period. • The high RUP:RDP ratio improved skeletal growth during post-weaning period. • Concurrent feeding of n-3 FA and high dietary RUP:RDP ratio is recommendable in young lambs raised during hot season.",

It is unclear whether regular intake of α-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, raises n-3 index in older adults. Of the 356 participants at the Loma Linda, CA centre from the original study, a randomly selected subset (n 192) was included for this secondary analysis (mostly Caucasian women, mean age 69 years). Participants were assigned to either the walnut (15 % of daily energy from walnuts) or the control group (usual diet, no walnuts) for 2 years. Erythrocyte fatty acids were determined at baseline and 1-year following intervention. No differences were observed for erythrocyte EPA, but erythrocyte DHA decreased albeit modestly in the walnut group (-0·125 %) and slightly improved in the control group (0·17 %). The change in n-3 index between the walnut and control groups was significantly different only among fish consumers (those who ate fish ≥ once/month). Longitudinal analyses combining both groups showed significant inverse association between the 1-year changes of the n-3 index and fasting plasma TAG (ß = -10), total cholesterol (ß = -5·59) and plasma glucose (ß = -0·27). Consuming ALA-rich walnuts failed to improve n-3 index in elders. A direct source of EPA/DHA may be needed to achieve desirable n-3 index, as it is inversely associated with cardiometabolic risk. Nevertheless, incorporating walnuts as part of heart healthy diets is still encouraged."

Our results showed that PS-ALA improved Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in both in vivo and in vitro models. Moreover, PS-ALA treatment can attenuate ERS and associated apoptosis via inhibiting IRE1α/TRAF2/JNK signal pathway. Furthermore, we found that the protective effect of PS-ALA on ERS-triggered apoptosis was mediated by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as pretreatment with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of PS-ALA.

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Mitochondria are the cells' main source of energy. Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a key hallmark of aging and is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Maintaining mitochondrial function might contribute to healthy aging and the prevention of AD. The Mediterranean diet, including walnuts, seems to prevent age-related neurodegeneration. Walnuts are a rich source of α-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential n3-fatty acid and the precursor for n3-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA), which might potentially improve mitochondrial function. (2) Methods: We tested whether a lipophilic walnut extract (WE) affects mitochondrial function and other parameters in human SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the neuronal amyloid precursor protein (APP695). Walnut lipids were extracted using a Soxhlet Extraction System and analyzed using GC/MS and HPLC/FD. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations were quantified under basal conditions in cell culture, as well as after rotenone-induced stress. Neurite outgrowth was investigated, as well as membrane integrity, cellular reactive oxygen species, cellular peroxidase activity, and citrate synthase activity. Beta-amyloid (Aβ) was quantified using homogenous time-resolved fluorescence. (3) Results: The main constituents of WE are linoleic acid, oleic acid, α-linolenic acid, and γ- and δ-tocopherol. Basal ATP levels following rotenone treatment, as well as citrate synthase activity, were increased after WE treatment. WE significantly increased cellular reactive oxygen species but lowered peroxidase activity. Membrane integrity was not affected. Furthermore, WE treatment reduced Aβ1-40 and stimulated neurite growth. (4) Conclusions: WE might increase ATP production after induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. Decreased Aβ1-40 formation and enhanced ATP levels might enhance neurite growth, making WE a potential agent to enhance neuronal function and to prevent the development of AD. In this sense, WE could be a promising agent for the prevention of AD.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the treating effect of Yiqi-Bushen-Tiaozhi (YBT) recipe on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice, determine whether the outcome was associated with gut microbiota, and clarify the regulating mechanism. METHODS: NASH mice were induced by high-fat and high-fructose diets (HFFD). In the fifth week, mice in the YBT group were orally administrated YBT (22.12g·kg-1·d-1) daily for 12 weeks. Fresh stool of mice was collected at the 16th week for fecal 16S rDNA analysis. Hepatic pathology and biochemical indicators were used to reflect the improvement of YBT on hepatic inflammation and lipid metabolism in NASH mice. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the results of PICRUSt analysis. RESULTS: Results of the pathological and biochemical index showed that YBT could improve NASH mice. Compared with improving inflammation and hepatocyte damage, YBT may be more focused on enhancing metabolic disorders in mice, such as increasing HDL-c level. The diversity and richness of the gut microbiota of NASH mice induced by HFFD are significantly different from the normal control (NC) group. After YBT treatment, the diversity and richness of the mice microbiota will be increased to similar NC mice. Intestinimonas, Acetatifactor, Alistipes, Intestinimonas, Acetatifactor, and Alistipes have the most significant changes in the class level. PICRUSt analysis was performed to predict genomic functions based on the 16S rDNA results and reference sequencing. The efficacy of YBT in the treatment of NASH can be achieved by regulating the diversity and richness of gut microbiota. PICRUSt analysis results showed that the most relevant function of the microbiota construction variations is α- Linolenic acid (ALA) metabolism. Results of qRT-PCR showed significant differences between groups in the expression of Fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), Fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), Acyl-CoA Oxidase 1 (ACOX1), and Acyl-CoA Oxidase 2 (ACOX2) related to ALA metabolism. The expression of the above genes will be inhibited in the liver and small intestine of the HFFD group mice, and the expression can be restored after YBT treatment. CONCLUSION: YBT could treat NASH mice by improving the diversity and richness of gut microbiota and further the improvement of ALA metabolism.",

Longzuantongbi granules (LZTBG) is an in-hospital preparation used at the First Affiliated Hospital of the Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine. This medicine is based on traditional Zhuang medicine theory for the treatment of \"Fawang\", and has an effectiveness of over 86.67%. It comprises eight medicinal materials, including the main drug Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. and Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A.C. Smith, the assisting drugs Alangium chinense (Lour.) Harms, Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC., Sinomenium acutum (Thunb.) Rehd.et Wils., Bauhinia championii (Benth.) Benth., Spatholobus suberectus Dunn, and Ficus hirta Vahl. All of these herbs are commonly used in Zhuang medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to reveal the effect of LZTBG on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, to discover the potential efficacy-related biomarkers and explore the intervention mechanism of LZTBG from a molecular level, based on metabolomics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into a normal group, a CIA model group, a positive control (MTX) group and two different LZTBG treatment groups (5.4 g/kg/d and 2.7 g/kg/d). Body weight, arthritis index (AI), paw swelling, and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining experiments were used to evaluate the efficacy of the established model. A metabolomics method based on an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique was established to analyze plasma taken from the rats, and to explore the interventional mechanism of LZTBG. RESULTS: LZTBG showed a positive effect on the CIA model rats. Thirty-one differential metabolites were screened out, and combined with pathway analysis, 11 potential efficacy-related biomarkers were then mapped in the pathway. These included linoleic acid (LA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), arachidonic acid (AA), 12-HETE, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), 13(S)-HOT, 2-oxobutanoate, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, L-Valine, and acetylcholine. Furthermore, it was found that these metabolites may exhibit an intervention effect by means of modulating pathways related to both lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism to associated with inflammation. CONCLUSION: LZTBG can effectively alleviate symptoms of RA, an effect that can primarily be attributed to the regulation of multiple pathways and multiple targets These results demonstrate that LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics is an advantageous technique for the investigation of the intervention effect and molecular mechanism of traditional compound medicine.",

      "abstract": "Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) is an 18-carbon essential fatty acid found in plant-based foods and oils. While much attention has been placed on conversion of ALA to long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, alternative routes of ALA metabolism exist and may lead to formation of other bioactive metabolites of ALA. The current study employed a non-targeted metabolomics approach to profile ALA metabolites that are significantly upregulated by ALA treatment. H4IIE hepatoma cells (n=3 samples per time point) were treated with 60 μM ALA or vehicle for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h. Samples were then extracted with methanol and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We observed selective changes in ALA incorporation into phospholipid classes and subclasses over the 12 h following ALA treatment. While levels of specific molecular species of ALA-containing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and lysophospholipids were elevated with ALA treatment, others were not affected. Of the phospholipids that were increased, some (e.g., PC[18:3/18:1], PC[18:3/18:4], PE[18:3/18:2], PE[18:3/18:3]) were elevated almost immediately after exposure to ALA, while others [e.g., PE[18:1/18:3] PA[18:3/22:6], and PA[18:3/18:2]) were not elevated until several hours after ALA treatment. Overall, these results suggest that ALA incorporation into phospholipids is selective and support a metabolic hierarchy for ALA incorporation into specific phospholipids. Given the functionality of phospholipids based on their fatty acid composition, future studies will need to investigate the implications of ALA incorporation into specific phospholipids on cell function.",

Although DHA can be provided to humans through nutrition and synthesized in vivo from its precursor alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), deficiencies in cerebral DHA level were associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The aim of this review was to develop a complete understanding of previous and current approaches and suggest future approaches to target the brain with DHA in different lipids' forms for potential prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Since glycerophospholipids (GPs) play a crucial role in DHA transport to the brain, we explored their biosynthesis and remodeling pathways with a focus on cerebral PUFA remodeling. Following this, we discussed the brain content and biological properties of phospholipids (PLs) and Lyso-PLs with omega-3 PUFA focusing on DHA's beneficial effects in healthy conditions and brain disorders. We emphasized the cerebral accretion of DHA when esterified at sn-2 position of PLs and Lyso-PLs. Finally, we highlighted the importance of DHA-rich Lyso-PLs' development for pharmaceutical applications since most commercially available DHA formulations are in the form of PLs or triglycerides, which are not the preferred transporter of DHA to the brain.",

Our study is aimed at evaluating the association between fatty acids (FA) in red blood cell (RBC) membranes, as a quantitative biomarker of regular dietary fat intake, and incident type 2 diabetes in a Spanish population. We included 1032 adult Spaniards (57% women, age 49 ± 15 years, 18% prediabetes), without diabetes at study entry, from the Di@bet.es cohort. Incident diabetes was diagnosed at the end of the study follow-up. The FA percentage in RBC was determined at baseline by gas chromatography. Participants were followed on average 7.5 ± 0.6 years. Lower percentages of linoleic acid (LA), α-linolenic (ALA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and higher percentages of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in RBC membranes were associated, independently of classical risk factors, with worse glucose metabolism at the end of the study follow-up. In addition, higher percentages of ALA and EPA, and moderate percentages of DHA, were associated with lower risk of diabetes. No significant associations were found for LA and diabetes risk. Dietary patterns rich in vegetables are independently associated with lower risk of both deterioration of glucose regulation and incident diabetes, and should be reinforced for the prevention of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is closely associated with abnormally chronic low-grade inflammation and gut dysbiosis. Flaxseed oil (FO) rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are mainly composed of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3 omega-3), has been demonstrated to exhibit pleiotropic benefits in chronic metabolic diseases. However, the impact of dietary ALA-rich FO on AS and its associated underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Thus, the present study was designed as two phases to investigate the effects in atherosclerotic Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice. In the initial portion, the ApoE -/- mice were randomly allocated to three groups: control group (CON), model group (MOD), and FO-fed model group (MOD/FO) and were treated for 12 weeks. The second phase used antibiotic (AB)-treated ApoE -/- mice were divided into two groups: AB-treated model group (AB/MOD) and FO-fed AB-treated model group (AB/FO). In the results, the dietary ALA-rich FO administration ameliorated atherosclerotic lesion, as well as the parameters of AS (body weights (BWs) and the total bile acids (TBA). Chronic systemic/vascular inflammatory cytokines and in situ macrophages (Mψs) were reduced with FO intervention. In addition, the FO improved the gut integrity and permeability by decreasing the plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, gut dysbiosis and metabolites [short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs)] in AS were modulated after FO treatment. Intriguingly, during an AB-treated condition, a significantly weakened amelioration of FO-treated on AS proposed that the intestinal microbiota contributed to the FO effects. A correlation analysis showed close relationships among gut bacteria, metabolites, and inflammation. Collectively, these results suggested that the dietary ALA-rich FO ameliorated the AS in ApoE -/- mice via the gut microbiota-inflammation-artery axis."

      "abstract": "Vitiligo is a depigmented skin disorder caused by a variety of factors, including autoimmune, metabolic disturbance or their combined effect, etc. Non-targeted metabolomic analyses have denoted that dysregulated fatty acids metabolic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. However, the exact category of fatty acids that participate in vitiligo development and how they functionally affect CD8+ T cells remain undefined. We aimed to determine the difference in specific fatty acids among vitiligo patients and healthy individuals and to investigate their association with clinical features in patients with vitiligo. Serum levels of fatty acids in 48 vitiligo patients and 28 healthy individuals were quantified by performing ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to evaluate the significance of differences. Moreover, flow cytometry was used to explore the effect of indicated fatty acids on the function of CD8+ T cells derived from patients with vitiligo. We demonstrated that serological level of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was markedly upregulated, while that of arachidonic acid (ARA), arachidic acid (AA) and behenic acid were significantly downregulated in patients with vitiligo. Moreover, ALA levels were positively associated with vitiligo area scoring index (VASI) and ARA was a probable biomarker for vitiligo. We also revealed that supplementation with ARA or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) could suppress the function of CD8+ T cells. Our results showed that vitiligo serum has disorder-specific phenotype profiles of fatty acids described by dysregulated metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Supplementation with ARA or NDGA might promote vitiligo treatment. These findings provide novel insights into vitiligo pathogenesis that might add to therapeutic options.",

This study hypothesized that it may be a biohydrogenation product of ALA in rumen and aimed to explore whether it was present in the rumen and help to understand the rumen biohydrogenation mechanisms of ALA. The in vitro experiment included two treatments, a control check (CK group) with 50 µL ethanol added, and ALA group with 50 µL ethanol and 2.6 mg ALA (ALA addition calculated by 1.30% of dry matter base of diet); each sample of fermentation fluid had the composition of C18 fatty acids analyzed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h. The results showed that no t9,c12,c15-C18:3 was detected in the CK group, but ALA addition increased the concentration of t9,c12,c15-C18:3 in fermentation fluid. The content of t9,c12,c15-C18:3 peaked 1 h after fermentation, then declined gradually. At 1 h, no t9c12c15-C18:3 was detected in the fermentation fluid of the CK treatment. The results suggested that ALA converted to the isomer t9,c12,c15-C18:3 through biohydrogenation in the rumen. The addition of ALA can also increase the concentration of t9,c12-C18:2, c9,t11-C18:2, c12-C18:1, t11-C18:1, t9-C18:1, and c6-C18:1 in fermentation fluid. It was concluded using an in vitro experiment that t9,c12,c15-C18:3 was a product of rumen biohydrogenation of ALA."

Here, supplements containing either PO alone or PO with nobiletin-rich air-dried immature ponkan powder were examined for their effects on cognitive function in 49 healthy elderly Japanese individuals. Patients were enrolled in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, parallel-armed study. Randomized participants in the PO group received soft gelatin capsules containing 1.47 mL (0.88 g of ALA) of PO daily, and those in the PO + ponkan powder (POPP) group received soft gelatin capsules containing both 1.47 mL of PO and 1.12 g ponkan powder (2.91 mg of nobiletin) daily. At the end of intervention, the POPP group showed significantly higher cognitive index scores than the PO group. The pro-cognitive effects of POPP treatment were accompanied by increases in ALA and docosahexaenoic acid levels in red blood cell plasma membranes, serum brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels, and biological antioxidant potential. We demonstrate that 12-month intervention with POPP enhances serum BDNF and antioxidant potential, and may improve age-related cognitive impairment in healthy elderly people by increasing red blood cell ω-3 fatty acid levels.

      "abstract": "Obesity is associated with elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs). Excessive saturated fatty acids (SFAs) exhibit significant deleterious cytotoxic effects in many types of cells. However, the effects of palmitic acid (PA), the most common circulating SFA, on cell cycle progression in neuronal cells have not been well-examined. The aim of this study was to examine whether PA affects the proliferation and cell cycle progression in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. Our studies found that 200 µM PA significantly decreased DNA synthesis and mitotic index in N2a cells as early as 4 h following treatment. 24 h treatment with 200 µM PA significantly decreased the percentage of diploid (2 N) cells while dramatically increasing the percentage of tetraploid (4 N) cells as compared to the BSA control. Moreover, our studies found that 24 h treatment with 200 µM PA increased the percentage of binucleate cells as compared to the BSA control. Our studies also found that unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), including linoleic acid, oleic acid, α-linolenic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, were able to abolish PA-induced decrease of 2 N cells, increase of 4 N cells, and accumulation of binucleate cells. Taken together, these results suggest that PA may affect multiple aspects of the cell cycle progression in N2a cells, including decreased DNA synthesis, G2/M arrest, and cytokinetic failure, which could be abolished by UFAs.Abbreviations: 4-PBA, 4-Phenylbutyric Acid; ALA, α-linolenic acid; BrdU, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine; DAPI, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FFA, free fatty acids; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LA, linoleic acid; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; N2a, Neuro-2a; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; OA, oleic acid; PA, palmitic acid; pHH3, Phosphorylation of histone H3; PI, propidium iodide; SFA, saturated fatty acids; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; UFA, unsaturated fatty acids.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between dietary fat intake and the onset of several metabolic diseases. This association is particularly evident in a diet rich in saturated fatty acids, typical of animal foods, such as dairy products. However, these foods are the main source of fatty acids with a proven nutraceutical effect, such as the ω-3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid (ALA) and the conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which have demonstrated important roles in the prevention of various diseases. In the present study, the effect of a supplementation with cheese enriched with ω-3 fatty acids and CLA on the metabolism and lipid profiles of C57bl/6 mice was evaluated. In particular, the analyses were conducted on different tissues, such as liver, muscle, adipose tissue and brain, known for their susceptibility to the effects of dietary fats. Supplementing cheese enriched in CLA and ω-3 fats reduced the level of saturated fat and increased the content of CLA and ALA in all tissues considered, except for the brain. Furthermore, the consumption of this cheese resulted in a tissue-specific response in the expression levels of genes involved in lipid and mitochondrial metabolism. As regards genes involved in the inflammatory response, the consumption of enriched cheese resulted in a reduction in the expression of inflammatory genes in all tissues analyzed. Considering the effects that chronic inflammation associated with a high-calorie and high-fat diet (meta-inflammation) or aging (inflammaging) has on the onset of chronic degenerative diseases, these data could be of great interest as they indicate the feasibility of modulating inflammation (thus avoiding/delaying these pathologies) with a nutritional and non-pharmacological intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary fatty acids intake affects the composition of erythrocyte fatty acids, which is strongly correlated with glycolipid metabolism disorders. This study aimed at investigating the different effects of marine-derived and plant-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) on the fatty acids of erythrocytes and glycolipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: The randomized double-blinded trial that was performed on 180 T2DM patients. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups for the six-month intervention. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups for the six-month intervention. The fish oil (FO) group was administered with FO at a dose of 3 g/day containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the perilla oil (PO) group was administered with PO at a dose of 3 g/day containing α-linolenic (ALA), the linseed and fish oil (LFO) group was administered with mixed linseed and fish oil at a dose of 3 g/day containing EPA, DHA and ALA. Demographic information were collected and anthropometric indices, glucose and lipid metabolism indexes, erythrocyte fatty acid composition were measured. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients finished the trial, with 52 of them in the FO group, 50 in the PO group and 48 in the LFO group. There were significant effects of time × treatment interaction on fast blood glucose (FBG), insulin, HOMA-IR and C-peptide, TC and triglyceride (TG) levels (P < 0.001). Glucose and C-peptide in PO and LFO groups decreased significantly and serum TG in FO group significantly decreased (P < 0.001) after the intervention. Erythrocyte C22: 5 n-6, ALA, DPA, n-6/n-3 PUFA, AA/EPA levels in the PO group were significantly higher than FO and LFO groups, while EPA, total n-3 PUFA and Omega-3 index were significantly higher in the FO and LFO groups compared to PO group. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with perilla oil decreased FBG while fish oil supplementation decreased the TG level. Marine-based and plant-based n-3 PUFAs exhibit different effects on fatty acid compositions of erythrocytes and regulated glycolipid metabolism.

      "abstract": "This article contains raw and processed data related to research published by Kra et al. [1]. There is a scarce knowledge on the proteome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during the transition period in dairy cows. In human research, proteomics PBMC is used in order to gain insight into inflammatory diseases and syndromes. Dietary fats, and specifically omega-3 (n-3) FA, can moderate the immune fluctuation caused by parturition through improvements of the immune function [2]. Therefore, this study aim was to characterize the changes that may occur in proteome of PBMC during transition, as influenced by different n-3 FA supplementation. Proteomics data of PBMC was obtained from postpartum dairy cows supplemented peripartum with either encapsulated saturated fat (CTL), encapsulated flaxseed oil that is enriched with ALA (α-linolenic acid; FLX) or encapsulated fish oil that is enriched with EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid; FO).The analysis was done by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry from PBMCs protein extraction. The cells were collected from six cows per treatment during the 1st week postpartum. Quantification of differential abundance between groups was done using MS1 intensity based label-free. Label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics was used for characterization. This novel dataset of proteomics data from PBMC contains 3807 proteins; 44, 42 and 65 were differently abundant (P ≤ 0.05 and FC ± 1.5), in FLX vs. CTL, FO vs. CTL and FLX vs. FO, respectively; these findings are discussed in our recent research article (Kra et al., 2021). The present dataset of PBMC proteome adds new information regarding the effects of n-3 FA on the immune system, while providing reference for PBMC proteome in postpartum dairy cows."
