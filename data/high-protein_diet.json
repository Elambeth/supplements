      "abstract": "Hippocampal dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including deficits in spatial learning and memory, represent a significant challenge to overall health. Dietary interventions are considered effective therapeutic approaches for managing metabolic parameters in T2DM, with a low-carbohydrate and high-protein (LC-HP) diet being a representative example. However, the impact of an LC-HP diet on hippocampal dysfunction in T2DM remains unclear. In this study, we examined the potential role of an LC-HP diet to alleviate spatial memory impairments. C57BL/6J and ob/ob mice were assigned to either an LC-HP diet group (25.1% carbohydrate, 57.2% protein, and 17.7% fat as percentages of calories) or a control diet group (58.9% carbohydrate, 24.0% protein, and 17.1% fat as percentages of calories). After four weeks of dietary intervention, all mice underwent the Morris water maze test, followed by hippocampal mRNA expression analysis. The findings demonstrated that the LC-HP diet improved spatial memory performance in ob/ob mice. This dietary regimen mitigated the downregulation of hippocampal mRNA levels for low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6), IGF-1 receptor (Igf1r), and Wnt3a observed in ob/ob mice. These results suggest that modulating biochemical molecules may play a role in ameliorating memory deficits associated with T2DM through LC-HP dietary interventions, highlighting potential targets for developing nutritional strategies to address hippocampal dysfunction caused by T2DM."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Telomere length (TL) is a key biomarker of cellular aging, with shorter telomeres associated with age-related diseases. Lifestyle interventions mitigating telomere shortening are essential for preventing such conditions. This study aimed to examine the effects of two weight loss dietary strategies, based on a moderately high-protein (MHP) diet and a low-fat (LF) diet on TL in individuals with overweight or obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 164 participants, aged 18-65 years from the OBEKIT trial received the MHP (n = 83) or the LF diet (n = 81) for 4 months and had TL data for analyses. TL was measured at baseline and after 4 months of the intervention using monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (MMqPCR). Both groups experienced significant improvements in anthropometric and biochemical parameters after the dietary intervention (p < 0.001). The MHP group showed an increase in TL (+0.16 ± 0.13) compared to the LF group (-0.05 ± 0.13) in multiple-adjusted models (p = 0.016). An interaction was observed between the sex and dietary group, where women in the MHP group had increased TL (+0.23 ± 0.16) after 4 months compared to women in the LF group (-0.13 ± 0.15; p = 0.001); no differences between dietary groups were found in men. This increase in TL for women was associated with an increase in protein intake (p = 0.006), measured through dietary questionnaires. CONCLUSION: This study shows that a MHP diet may have a protective effect on TL during weight loss, particularly in women, potentially contributing to healthier aging. These results highlight the importance of considering macronutrient composition in dietary interventions aimed at preserving TL.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Despite beneficial cardiovascular effects, substantial long-term modulation of food pattern could only be achieved in a limited number of participants. The impact of attitude towards healthy nutrition (ATHN) on successful modulation of dietary behavior is unclear, especially in the elderly. We aimed to analyze whether the personal ATHN influences 12-month adherence to two different dietary intervention regimes within a 36-month randomized controlled trial. METHODS: 502 subjects were randomized to an intervention group (IG; dietary pattern focused on high intake of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), plant protein and fiber) or control group (CG; dietary recommendation in accordance with the German Society of Nutrition) within a 36-month dietary intervention trial. Sum scores for effectiveness, appreciation and practice of healthy nutrition were assessed using ATHN questionnaire during the trial (n = 344). Linear regression models were used to investigate associations between ATHN and dietary patterns at baseline and at month 12. RESULTS: Retirement, higher education level, age and lower body mass index (BMI) were associated with higher ATHN sum scores. ATHN was similar in CG and IG. Higher baseline intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and fiber as well as lower intake in saturated fatty acids (SFA) were associated with higher scores in practice in both groups. The intervention resulted in a stronger increase of UFA, protein and fiber in the IG after 12 months, while intake of SFA declined (p < 0.01). Higher scores in appreciation were significantly associated with higher intake of fiber and lower intake of SFA in the CG at month 12, whereas no associations between ATHN and macronutrient intake were observed in the IG after 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: While ATHN appeared to play a role in general dietary behavior, ATHN did not affect the success of the specific dietary intervention in the IG at month 12. Thus, the dietary intervention achieved a substantial modification of dietary pattern in the IG and was effective to override the impact of the individual ATHN on dietary behavior.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Demographic changes are resulting in a continual increase in the proportion of individuals over 65 years old. Simultaneously, muscle mass (MM) tends to decrease with age, with a decline noticeable from the middle of the fourth decade of life. While physical activity is considered a modulator for maintaining MM, the interaction with nutrient uptake, especially protein intake, is getting more into focus. Due to a lack of data on the effect of a high-protein diet on middle-aged individuals (40-65 years), this study aimed to investigate the influence of a high-protein diet in middle-aged physically active persons on body composition and performance. METHODS: Using stratified randomization, participants were allocated to either a high-protein group (>2.3 g/kg FFM/day) (n = 12, age = 57.83 ± 7.74 years, height = 170.42 cm ± 11.04 cm, BMI = 30.26 ± 4.46, MM = 31.71 ± 6.89 kg) or a control group (<2.3 g/kg/FFM/day) (n = 14, age = 58.21 ± 6.44 years, height = 170.57 cm ± 8.28 cm, BMI = 26.31 ± 5.59, MM = 29.67 ± 8.08 kg). Body composition [fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), MM] and strength were assessed at baseline (T0), after four weeks (T1) and after eight weeks (T2). Exercise habits were not changed over the entire period and dietary habits were recorded using FDDB Explorer. Statistical analysis was performed using the current version of R and linear mixed models. RESULTS: No significant differences in energy intake were found between the groups (p = .974). In macronutrient distribution, a significantly higher consumption of protein was found in the high-protein group (p < .0001, d = 2.22) [140 ± 70 g/day (HPG) vs. 79 ± 40 g/day (CG)]. A trivial reduction in FM over time in both groups (p = .046, d = 0.04, Δt=-.83±1.60kg) was observed. No significant differences were detected in FFM (p = .887) and MM (p = .711). Trivial interaction effects (time*group) were observed for upper (p = .007, d = 0.12, ΔHPG = 4.38 ± 3.25 kg) and lower body strength (p = .0507, d = 0.07, ΔHPG = 3.33 ± 2.36 kg). DISCUSSION: Our results indicate no to only trivial effects of adding a high-protein diet to otherwise physically active middle-aged individuals. Trivial effects could be seen for an increase in muscle strength after this eight-week intervention. However, MM and FFM were not significantly affected. Based on the small effect sizes we observed in our results we do not see a benefit of a high-protein diet on body composition and strength capacity without altering the exercise habits."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) are increased in type 2 diabetes and are potential regulators of metabolism. The effect of changes in caloric intake and macronutrient composition on their circulating levels in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet with and without a clinically significant weight loss on circulating levels of FGF21 and GDF15 in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We measured circulating FGF21 and GDF15 in patients with type 2 diabetes who completed 2 previously published diet interventions. Study 1 randomized 28 subjects to an isocaloric diet in a 6 + 6-week crossover trial consisting of, in random order, a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) or a conventional diabetes (CD) diet. Study 2 randomized 72 subjects to a 6-week hypocaloric diet aiming at a ∼6% weight loss induced by either a CRHP or a CD diet. Fasting plasma FGF21 and GDF15 were measured before and after the interventions in a subset of samples (n = 24 in study 1, n = 66 in study 2). RESULTS: Plasma levels of FGF21 were reduced by 54% in the isocaloric study (P < .05) and 18% in the hypocaloric study (P < .05) in CRHP-treated individuals only. Circulating GDF15 levels increased by 18% (P < .05) following weight loss in combination with a CRHP diet but only in those treated with metformin. CONCLUSION: The CRHP diet significantly reduced FGF21 in people with type 2 diabetes independent of weight loss, supporting the role of FGF21 as a \"nutrient sensor.\" Combining metformin treatment with carbohydrate restriction and weight loss may provide additional metabolic improvements due to the rise in circulating GDF15."

      "abstract": "\"Exploring AMH Levels, Homeostasis and Primordial Follicle Activation in Pubertal Infected Sheep on a High Protein Diet \". The first activation wave of ovarian primordial follicles is part of the onset of puberty and fertility. Abomasal helminth infection may cause an undesirable delay in puberty manifestation. Helminth-infected animals demand a higher amount of protein in their diet to repair the damage caused by the parasite in sheep's tissues, replenish the blood losses, and build the host's immune response. Helminths become resistant to drug therapy shortly after being exposed to a new treatment. Besides, there is the possibility of contamination by anthelmintic drugs in ovine products, possibly affecting human health and the environment. This study's objective was to evaluate if ovarian and clinical parameters can be improved by supplementing their diet with protein, offering a more sustainable management approach than relying on anthelmintic usage. We used a 2 × 2 factorial model where eighteen ewe lambs (Ovis aries) between 6 and 7 months old - born to the same ram - were fed one of two diet protein levels (12% or 19%). After 35 days on this diet, they were infected or left uninfected with 10,000 Haemonchus contortus L3 larvae. We evaluated Anti-Mullerian Hormone serum levels, blood cells and biochemical parameters at four different time points. Following 42 days of infection and 77 days on the diet, the lambs had their left ovaries removed, and we examined ovarian morphometrics through histological analysis. The groups Supplemented Protein-Infected(n = 5), Control Protein- Infected(n = 5), Supplemented Protein-Not Infected (n = 4) and Control Protein-Not Infected (n = 4) did not differ in their bodyweight gain. In the factorial ANOVA analysis examining the relationship between plasma protein, diet, and infection, the protein level of the diet showed significance (p = 0.02). Primordial follicle size varied with the interaction between diet and infection (p < 0.05), and oocyte size was affected by the level of protein in the diet (p = 0.047). Additionally, to understand how all homeostasis parameters relate to the primordial follicle and oocyte size, we applied an explanatory linear mixed model. In conclusion, serum AMH levels remained stable despite the infection and variations in diet protein levels, indicating its reliability as a marker for ovarian reserve in pubertal sheep. The number of blood cells, biochemical parameters, and primordial follicle activation were affected by both diet and infection.",

However, no studies have examined the effects of these diets in obese adults. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of low-calorie high protein diets on sleep quality in obese adults. METHODS: This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted on 60 obese adults (BMI > 29.9 kg/m2) diagnosed with low-quality sleep. All participants were given a diet with a 750-calorie energy deficit. While the control group was given a normal diet, the intervention group received a diet with 30% more protein. RESULTS: The results showed a significant difference between the control group and intervention group with respect to sleep apnea at 30-, 60-, and 90-day follow-up (p < 0.01). Sleep quality, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), sleep latency (SL), and polysomnography were significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05), showing an improvement in sleep quality and obstructive sleep apnea in the intervention group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study shows that low-calorie high-protein diets can effectively improve apnea, sleep quality, and body composition indices in obese adults."

The present study investigated the effects of a high-protein diet, including a high-protein drink consumed immediately after high-intensity interval training (HIIT), on appetite and weight loss in obese middle-aged individuals. A total of 52 obese middle-aged individuals (58.2 ± 4.11 years old) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the exercise group (E, n=19), exercise and high-protein diet group (ED, n=21), and a control group (n=12). The E and ED groups engaged in cycling HIIT (comprising 90 % of peak heart rate (HRpeak) for 3 min, followed by 70 % of HRpeak for 3 min, for a total of 5 cycles) three times a week for 3 months. The ED group consumed a high-protein drink immediately after HIIT and had a daily protein intake of 1.6g/kg. Body composition and eating behavior were assessed before and after the intervention. Additionally, appetite levels were measured before and after each exercise session, before dinner, and before bedtime during three phases of the intervention: the first phase (weeks 3-4), the second phase (weeks 5-8), and the third phase (weeks 9-12). Results showed that only the ED group experienced a decrease in body mass index (from 27.4 ± 4.28 to 26.8 ± 4.09 kg/m2, p=0.04). Appetite significantly increased after exercise in both E and ED groups (p values for the three phases ranged from 0.04 to 0.001 for the E group and from 0.042 to 0.003 for the ED group). The desire to eat significantly increased after exercise in the E group (phase 1: p = 0.026; phase 2: p = 0.011; phase 3: p = 0.003), but not in the ED group. Furthermore, the frequency of late-night snacking decreased in the ED group (the score changed from 2.4 ± 0.86 to 2.7 ± 0.80, p = 0.034). Notably, the E group tended to have a higher pre-dinner appetite score than the ED group in the third phase (p = 0.063). In summary, a high daily protein intake, combined with the consumption of high-protein drinks after exercise, resulted in reduced post-exercise appetite and a decrease in the frequency of late-night snacking.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The last decade has seen the increased prevalence of obesity as a public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. At the same time, studies have shown that there is a two-way relationship between low-calorie diets and depression in obese individuals. This study was designed and implemented to investigate the effect of a low-calorie high-protein diet on psychometric variables in obese individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study is a Randomized Clinical Trial. Individuals meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (low-calorie diet with increased protein percentage) or the control group (standard protein percentage) using block stratification. Psychometric characteristics of the participants were evaluated using the DASS-21 questionnaire. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in enrollment between the two groups with respect to anthropometric variables, body composition, and physical activity (p-value > .05). Similarly, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of psychological variables (depression, anxiety and stress) (p-value > .05). However, the intervention groups had significantly lower depression and anxiety scores 15 days into the intervention (p-value < .05). After 30 and 60 days of intervention, significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of depression, stress, and anxiety (p-value < .05), indicating a relative improvement in psychometric variables in the intervention group (p-value < .05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that low-calorie diets with a high-protein percentage can significantly improve psychometric variables in obese people.Trial registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials identifier: IRCT20221101056371N1..",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that a high-fat and high-protein diet (HFHPD) causes constipation. This study focuses on understanding how the use of Zhishi Daozhi decoction (ZDD) affects the intricate balance of intestinal microorganisms. The insights gained from this investigation hold the potential to offer practical clinical approaches to mitigate the constipation-related issues associated with HFHPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into five groups: the normal (MN) group, the natural recovery (MR) group, the low-dose ZDD (MLD) group, the medium-dose ZDD (MMD) group, and the high-dose ZDD (MHD) group. After the constipation model was established by HFHPD combined with loperamide hydrochloride (LOP), different doses of ZDD were used for intervention. Subsequently, the contents of cholecystokinin (CCK) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in serum, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver were determined. The DNA of intestinal mucosa was extracted, and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to analyze the changes in intestinal mucosal microbiota. RESULTS: After ZDD treatment, CCK content in MR group decreased and CGRP content increased, but the changes were not significant. In addition, the SOD content in MR group was significantly lower than in MLD, MMD, and MHD groups, and the MDA content in MR group was significantly higher than in MN, MLD, and MHD groups. Constipation modeling and the intervention of ZDD changed the structure of the intestinal mucosal microbiota. In the constipation induced by HFHPD, the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Aerococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Desulfovibrio, Clostridium, and Prevotella increased. After the intervention of ZDD, the relative abundance of these pathogenic bacteria decreased, and the relative abundance of Candidatus Arthromitus and the abundance of Tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis pathways increased in MHD group. CONCLUSION: Constipation induced by HFHPD can increase pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal mucosa, while ZDD can effectively relieve constipation, reduce the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria, and alleviate oxidative stress injury. In addition, high-dose ZDD can increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria, which is more conducive to the treatment of constipation."

      "abstract": "Excessive protein intake causes liver and brain damage and neurotransmitter disorders, thereby inducing cognitive dysfunction. L-theanine can regulate the neurotransmitter content and show great potential in liver and brain protection. However, it remains unclear whether l-theanine effectively regulates neurotransmitter content under high-protein diet. A 40-day feeding experiment was performed in Sprague Dawley rats to investigate the regulatory effects and mechanisms of l-theanine on neurotransmitters via liver-brain axis in high-protein diets. The results showed that a 30% protein diet increased the liver and brain neurotransmitter content while maintaining the normal structure of liver and the hippocampal CA1 of brain and improving the autonomous behavior of rats. In contrast, 40% and 50% protein diets decreased the content of neurotransmitters, affected autonomous behavior, destroyed the hippocampal CA1 of brain structure, increased hepatic inflammatory infiltration, lipid degeneration, and hepatocyte eosinophilic change in liver, increased liver AST, ALT, MDA, CRP, and blood ammonia level, and decreased liver SOD and CAT level. However, l-theanine improved liver and brain neurotransmitter content, autonomous behavior, liver and hippocampal brain structure, and liver biochemical indicators in 40% and 50% protein diets. To explore how LTA can eliminate the adverse effects of a high-protein diet, we analyzed different metabolites and proteomes and using western blotting for validate quantitatively. We found that l-theanine regulates the activity of PF4 and G protein subunit alpha i2, increases the content of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and dopamine under a 20% protein diet. In addition, l-theanine can activate the adenylate cyclase-protein kinase A pathway through the protein alpha/beta-hydrolase domain protein 12 to regulate the content of neurotransmitters under a 40% protein diet, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect.",

The present study investigated the effect of 10 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and a high-protein diet (HPD) on gut microbiota composition and body weight changes in obese male Wistar rats. Forty obese rats were randomly divided into five groups, including HPD, HIIT + HPD, HIIT + high-fat diet (HFD) (continuing HFD during intervention), obese control 1 (continuing HFD during intervention), obese control 2 (cutting off HFD at the beginning of the intervention and continuing standard diet), and eight non-obese Wistar rats as a non-obese control (NOC) group (standard diet). Microbial community composition and diversity analysis by sequencing 16S rRNA genes derived from the fecal samples, body weight, and Lee index were assessed. The body weight and Lee index in the NOC, HIIT + HFD, HPD, and HIIT + HPD groups were significantly lower than that in the OC1 and OC2 groups along with the lower body weight and Lee index in the HPD and HIIT + HPD groups compared with the HIIT + HFD group. Also, HFD consumption and switching from HFD to a standard diet or HPD increased gut microbiota dysbiosis. Furthermore, HIIT along with HFD increased the adverse effects of HFD on gut microbiota, while the HIIT + HPD increased microbial richness, improved gut microbiota dysbiosis, and changed rats' phenotype to lean. It appears that HFD discontinuation without doing HIIT does not improve gut microbiota dysbiosis. Also, the HIIT + HFD, HPD, and HIIT + HPD slow down HFD-induced weight gain, but HIIT + HPD is a more reliable strategy for weight management due to its beneficial effects on gut microbiota composition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of a high protein diet in combination with chronic resistance training (RT) on skeletal muscle adaptation responses in untrained older ex-military men is unknown. Therefore, we compared the effects of 8 weeks of RT in combination with either a high (1.6 g/kg/d) or low protein diet (0.8 g/kg/d) on body composition [skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and body fat percentage (BFP)], muscular strength, power, and endurance (upper and lower body), markers of liver [alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)] and kidney (creatinine and urea) function, and lipid profile low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and cholesterol levels in a cohort of healthy, untrained older ex-military males. METHODS: Forty healthy untrained older ex-military males (age: 61 ± 2 yr, body mass index: 23.2 ± 1.3 kg.m-2) performed 8 weeks (three sessions·w-1) of RT with either 1.6 g/kg/d (RHP; n = 20) or 0.8 g/kg/d of protein (RLP; n = 20). Body composition (assessed by Inbody 720), muscular strength (1-RM for chest and leg press), power (Wingate test), endurance (75% 1-RM for chest and leg press), and markers of liver and kidney function (biochemical kits) were assessed pre and post-intervention. RESULTS: SMM and muscular strength (upper and lower body) increased post-intervention in both groups and were significantly greater in RHP compared to RLP, while muscular power increased to the same extent in both groups (p < 0.05) with no between-group differences (p > 0.05). In contrast, there were no post-intervention changes in muscular endurance, HDL, and BFP remained in either group (p > 0.05). ALT and creatinine significantly increased in RHP compared to RLP while GGT, AST, and urea only increased in the RLP group (p < 0.05). LDL and cholesterol significantly decreased in both groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A daily intake of 1.6 g/kg/d protein was superior to 0.8 g/kg/d (current recommended daily intake) for promoting greater improvements in SMM and muscle strength and thus may be a more suitable level of intake for promoting such adaptive responses. Notwithstanding observed between-group differences in ALT and creatinine and the fact that levels remained within normal ranges, it is feasible to conclude that this daily protein intake is efficacious and well tolerated by healthy, untrained older ex-military males."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hyperuricemia is widespread in humans and birds which is a necessary physiological factor leading to gout. Studies have shown an inextricable relationship between gut microbiota and hyperuricemia. This study explored the association between intestinal flora and hyperuricemia in Goslings. METHODS AND RESULTS: The hyperuricemia model was established in gosling by a high protein diet (HPD). 16S rDNA sequencing showed that the cecal microbiota differed significantly between the HPD and control groups (fed with the normal protein). The abundance of Firmicutes was higher in the HPD group, while the Bacteroidetes were lower than in controls. To investigate the role of intestinal flora in hyperuricemia, the cecum microbiotas from the HPD group and the control group were transplanted to the newly born goslings by gavage. The serum uric acid levels of the goslings that transplanted the cecal microbiota of the HPD group were significantly higher than the goslings that transplanted the cecal microbiota of the controls. Furthermore, the transplantation of cecal microbiota also affects the production and excretion of uric acid in goslings. Then we identify the gut bacterium Bacteroides xylanisolvens as an effective anti-hyperuricemia in the Goslings. B. xylanisolvens reduces serum uric acid concentrations in hyperuricemia in the Goslings' model, and it can up-regulation ABCG2 mRNA expression in the kidney and down-regulation XDH mRNA expression in the liver. DISCUSSION: The intestinal flora acts as a novel target for the therapeutic approach to hyperuricemia and gout, suggest Bacteroides xylanisolvens is a possible route to therapy for hyperuricemia and gout in goslings."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Yinlai Decoction (YD) on the microstructure of colon, and activity of D-lactic acid (DLA) and diamine oxidase (DAO) in serum of pneumonia mice model fed with high-calorie and high-protein diet (HCD). METHODS: Sixty male Kunming mice were randomly divided into 6 groups by the random number table method: normal control, pneumonia, HCD, HCD with pneumonia (HCD-P), YD (229.2 mg/mL), and dexamethasone (15.63 mg/mL) groups, with 10 in each group. HCD mice were fed with 52% milk solution by gavage. Pneumonia mice was modeled with lipopolysaccharide inhalation and was fed by gavage with either the corresponding therapeutic drugs or saline water, twice daily, for 3 days. After hematoxylin-eosin staining, the changes in the colon structure were observed under light microscopy and transmission electron microscope, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the protein levels of DLA and DAO in the serum of mice. RESULTS: The colonic mucosal structure and ultrastructure of mice in the normal control group were clear and intact. The colonic mucosal goblet cells in the pneumonia group tended to increase, and the size of the microvilli varied. In the HCD-P group, the mucosal goblet cells showed a marked increase in size with increased secretory activity. Loose mucosal epithelial connections were also observed, as shown by widened intercellular gaps with short sparse microvilli. These pathological changes of intestinal mucosa were significantly reduced in mouse models with YD treatment, while there was no significant improvement after dexamethasone treatment. The serum DLA level was significantly higher in the pneumonia, HCD, and HCD-P groups as compared with the normal control group (P<0.05). Serum DLA was significantly lower in the YD group than HCD-P group (P<0.05). Moreover, serum DLA level significantly increased in the dexamethasone group as compared with the YD group (P<0.01). There was no statistical significance in the serum level of DAO among groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YD can protect function of intestinal mucosa by improving the tissue morphology of intestinal mucosa and maintaining integrity of cell connections and microvilli structure, thereby reducing permeability of intestinal mucosa to regulate the serum levels of DLA in mice.",

METHODS: Thirty male Kunming (KM) mice were randomly divided into normal (NM), model (MD), and BPD groups. Diarrhea models were manufactured using HFHPD combined with a gavage of vegetable oil. At the end of modeling, the BPD group was given BPD (6.63 g·kg-1d-1) intervention twice daily for 3 d. The NM and MD groups were given equal amounts of sterile water. Subsequently, the intestinal mucosa of the mice was collected, one portion was used for microbial and lactase activity measurement, and the other portion was used for its lactase-producing bacterial characteristics by high-throughput sequencing technology. RESULTS: Our results showed that microbial and lactase activity of intestinal mucosa decreased significantly following diarrhea in mice (Pmicrobial < 0.05, Plactase < 0.001). After BPD intervention, microbial and lactase activity increased significantly (P < 0.01). The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), richness, and diversity index of lactase-producing bacteria increased in the BPD group compared to the MD group (P > 0.05), and the community structure were significant differences (P < 0.01). Compared to other groups, Saccharopolyspora, Rhizobium, Cedecea, and Escherichia were enriched in the BPD group. Notably, the relative abundance of the dominant lactase-producing genus Bifidobacterium decreased after BPD intervention. DISCUSSION: The mechanism of BPD in relieving diarrhea induced by HFHPD is closely related to the promotion of lactase activity in the intestinal mucosa, which may be achieved by regulating the structure of lactase-producing bacteria."

The microbiota in PC and DC was dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, in which Bacteroidetes were more abundant in DC (∼60% versus 50%) and Firmicutes were more abundant in PC (∼40% versus 25%). Most of the tryptophan catabolites were determined at a higher concentration in PC samples than in DC samples, but the overall concentration of tryptophan catabolites was over 10-fold higher in DC samples than that in PC samples. Interestingly, indole-3-propionic acid and oxindole were only identified in DC samples. A two-week dietary intervention by the HF diet enriched the abundance of Firmicutes in PC, whereas the HP diet enriched the abundance of Proteobacteria. Compared to the HP diet, the HF diet favored the microbial production of indole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, indole-3-aldehyde, and indole-3-propionic acid in both PC and DC compartments. To conclude, these findings increase the understanding of the effect of diets on the microbial production of tryptophan catabolites in the colon.",

Secondary analyses were conducted from a randomized trial of an adaptive behavioral intervention to assess the relationship between post-exercise and daily protein (g/kg) intake on glycemia following moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adolescents with T1D. Adolescents (n = 112) with T1D, 14.5 (13.8, 15.7) years of age, and 36.6% overweight or obese, provided measures of glycemia using continuous glucose monitoring (percent time above range [TAR, >180 mg/dL], time-in-range [TIR, 70-180 mg/dL], time-below-range [TBR, <70 mg/dL]), self-reported physical activity (previous day physical activity recalls), and 24 h dietary recall data at baseline and 6 months post-intervention. Mixed effects regression models adjusted for design (randomization assignment, study site), demographic, clinical, anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, and timing covariates estimated the association between post-exercise and daily protein intake on TAR, TIR, and TBR from the cessation of MVPA bouts until the following morning. Daily protein intakes of ≥1.2 g/kg/day were associated with 6.9% (p = 0.03) greater TIR and -8.0% (p = 0.02) less TAR following exercise, however, no association was observed between post-exercise protein intake and post-exercise glycemia. Following current sports nutrition guidelines for daily protein intake may promote improved glycemia following exercise among adolescents with T1D.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the effect of diarrhea induced by a high-fat and high-protein diet on lactase-producing bacteria in the intestinal contents of mice from the perspective of diarrhea-related genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten specific pathogen-free Kunming male mice were chosen and randomly divided into the normal group and model group. The mice in the normal group were fed with high-fat and high-protein diet plus gavage of vegetable oil, while those in the model group were fed with general diet plus gavage of distilled water. After successful modeling, the distribution and diversity of lactase-producing bacteria in the intestinal contents were characterized by metagenomic sequencing technology. RESULTS: After high-fat and high-protein diet intervention, Chao1, observed species index, and operational taxonomic units number decreased in the model group (P > .05), while the Shannon, Simpson, Pielou's evenness, and Goods coverage indices increased (P > .05). The principal coordinate analysis showed that the composition of lactase-producing bacteria differed between the normal group and model group (P < .05). The lactase-producing bacterial source in the intestinal contents of mice was Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, of which Actinobacteria was the most abundant phylum. At the genus level, both groups had their unique genera, respectively. Compared to the normal group, the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Rhizobium, and Sphingobium increased, while Lachnoclostridium, Lactobacillus, Saccharopolyspora, and Sinorhizobium decreased in the model group. CONCLUSION: High-fat and high-protein diet altered the structure of lactase-producing bacteria in the intestinal contents, elevating the abundance of dominant lactase-producing bacteria, while decreasing the richness of lactase-producing bacteria, which may further induce the occurrence of diarrhea.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12-week tailored lifestyle intervention, consisting of physical training and a high protein diet (2 grams/kg), in children with Pompe disease. This randomized controlled semi-crossover trial investigated the effects of a lifestyle intervention on the primary outcome: exercise capacity. Secondary outcomes were: muscle strength, core stability, motor function, physical activity levels, quality of life, fatigue, fear of exercise, caloric intake, energy balance, body composition, and safety. Fourteen Pompe patients with a median age of 10.6 [IQR: 7.2-14.5], of whom six classic infantile patients, participated in the lifestyle intervention. At baseline, patients had a lower exercise capacity compared to healthy peers (median 70.3% [IQR: 54.8%-98.6%] of predicted). After the intervention, absolute Peak VO2 improved significantly (1279 mL/min [1012.5-2006] vs. 1352 mL/min [1101.5-2069], p = 0.039), but not compared to the control period. Muscle strength of the hip flexors, hip abductors, elbow extensors, neck extensors, knee extensors, and core stability improved significantly compared to the control period. Children reported a significant increase on the change in health domain of quality of life, parents reported significantly better scores on the quality of life domains: physical functioning, change in health, family cohesion, and fatigue. A 12-week tailored lifestyle intervention for children with Pompe disease seemed safe and led to improvements in muscle strength, core stability, quality of life, and parent-reported fatigue. Pompe patients with a stable disease trajectory seemed to benefit the most from the intervention.",

Exercise and nutrition, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, are able to affect inflammation. Therefore, we examined the effects of an 8-week exercise and dietary intervention on the inflammatory response in community-dwelling old adults. All participants received weekly vibration and home-based resistance exercise. Furthermore, participants were randomized to either a control, high-protein (1.2-1.5 g/kg), or high-protein, omega-3-enriched (2.2 g/day) diet. Before and after treatment, inflammatory markers in fasting serum and after whole-blood ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation were assessed. Gene expression levels of inflammatory markers were quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Sixty-one participants (age: 70.6 ± 4.7 years; 47% men) completed the study. According to generalized linear mixed models, a high-protein, omega-3-enriched diet decreased circulating anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL-) 10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). Sex-stratified analyses showed also significantly reduced pro-inflammatory markers in men with a high-protein, omega-3-enriched diet. Gene expression of IL-1RA was significantly reduced after both protein-enriched diets compared with controls. In comparison to a high-protein diet, exercise alone showed lower LPS-induced release of c-c motif chemokine ligand-2 (CCL-2), which tended to be more pronounced in men compared with women. Eight weeks of a high-protein, omega-3-enriched diet combined with exercise decreased circulating anti-inflammatory markers, and pro-inflammatory markers in men. A high-protein diet attenuated anti-inflammatory markers on gene expression level in PBMC. Exercise alone resulted in a lower pro-inflammatory response to LPS-exposure in whole-blood cultures.",

Studies exploring interventions with a plant-based, high-protein diet on fatigue and body composition are lacking. The effects of these interventions on fatigue, body mass index (BMI), and body composition were evaluated. METHOD: Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who were scheduled for adjuvant CT (n = 103) were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Study outcomes included fatigue using fatigue symptom inventory and body composition using bioelectric impedance analyzer done at the start of CT, 3rd CT, and 3 weeks after CT. Linear mixed models were used to compare groups over time. RESULTS: Fatigue decreased from 57% to 28% in the intervention group and increased from 65% to 78% in the control group (p < 0.001). BMI decreased by 0.7 ± 0.8 kg/m2 in the intervention group, while the decrease was 0.4 ± 1.3 kg/m2 in the control group (p = 0.015). Fat mass decreased in the intervention group (p < 0.001) and muscle mass improved in the intervention group and decreased in the control group (p < 0.05).

Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO), a form of dietary fiber, could induce the afferent signal that causes appetite suppression. However, the direct effect of fiber supplementation in the form of IMO combined with a high-protein diet (HPF) on those parameters is still unknown. This study aims to investigate the effect of HPF on anthropometric parameters and blood glucose regulation of healthy subjects.  . METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects were given a hypocaloric high protein diet (HPD) mixed with their prepared meals for two weeks. Followed by the HPF diet for another two weeks. Their anthropometric parameters, such as body composition (total body weight, body fat percentage, and fat-free mass), BMI and waist circumference, and fasting plasma glucose, were measured. RESULTS: Compared to pre-intervention, HPF could significantly (p ≤ 0.004) reduce the anthropometric parameters and fasting plasma glucose. Compared to HPD, HPF could significantly (p ≤ 0.005) reduce more total body weight, body fat percentage, and BMI. In addition, HPF could induce more satiety than HPD (higher VAS score). CONCLUSION: HPF could improve the subject's anthropometric parameters which is obviously beneficial in preventing the risk of developing diabetes."

However, it is unknown whether it regulates protein metabolism in individuals on high-protein diets (HPDs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, Sprague-Dawley rats are fed HPDs with different protein supply ratios and administered a diverse dose of LTA for 40 days. Results show that HPDs with an energy supply ratio from protein >40% impair the liver and kidneys, elevate serum ammonia and urea nitrogen, induce amino acid (AA) catabolism, and promote fatty acid (FA) synthesis via FA-binding protein 5 (Fabp5) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). LTA intervention alleviates HPD-induced hepatic and renal injury and improves serum biochemical indices. It increases hepatic free AA content and inhibits FA synthesis by downregulating Fabp5 and ACC1. It promotes protein synthesis by acting on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thereby alleviating HPD-induced metabolic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that LTA mitigates kidney and liver damage induced by long-term excess HPDs by regulating protein metabolism.",

METHODS: Outpatients with COPD and severe or very severe (GOLD grade III-IV) disease and malnutrition commencing pulmonary rehabilitation were randomised to a high-protein diet or standard care. FFM was measured by bio-impedance analysis (BIA), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and mid-thigh circumference (MTC), peripheral muscle function by six-minute walking distance (6MWD) and handgrip strength (HGS), symptoms by the COPD Assessment Trial (CAT) and dyspnoea by the Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale and Borg scores; all at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Ten out of 13 randomised patients completed the trial. The intervention group was superior to the control group with respect to 6MWD (97 ± 93 m, p = 0.04) at 12 weeks. No differences were observed between the groups in HGS, anthropometrics, symptom burden or dyspnoea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP), DisGeNET, UniProt, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and GeneCards databases were used to collect the potential targets with active ingredients of Baohe pill decoction, diarrhea, and lactase, and then construct correlation networks. Fifteen Kunming mice were randomly divided into the control group (CN), natural recovery group (NR), and Baohe pill decoction treatment group (BHP), with five mice in each group. After constructing a mouse diarrhea model by HFHPD induction, BHP was gavaged with Baohe pill decoction, and the other groups were gavaged with distilled water of equal. The intestinal contents were collected from ileal to jejunal and analyzed using metagenomic sequencing to characterize the intestinal content of lactase-producing bacteria in mice. RESULTS: The core active ingredients related to diarrhea in Baohe pill decoction were quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, forsythin, and wogonin. And there was no intersection between the potential targets with the active ingredient of Baohe pill, lactase, and diarrhea. After the intervention of Baohe pill decoction, the Observed species, Chao1 index, and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) number increased in BHP (P > 0.05), while the Pielous evenness and Shannon index decreased (P > 0.05). In Beta diversity, the community structure of the NR was significantly different from CN and BHP (P < 0.05), and the community structure of the CN was not significant difference from BHP (P > 0.05). Compared to NR, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Amycolatopsis increased, while the relative abundance of Lachnoclostridium, Sinorhizobium, Cedecea, and Escherichia decreased in BHP, but none of the significant differences (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effect of Baohe pill decoction on diarrhea induced by HFHPD does not appear to involve the body's lactase gene targets directly, but is associated with the change of the construction of lactase-producing bacterial communities.",

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the influence of a habitual diet (CON) with either a diet containing the recommended protein intake (RP) or a high protein intake (HP), both with and without strength training, on the plasma proteome in older adults. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six women and men (65-85 years) were randomly assigned to three intervention groups. CON continued their habitual diet; participants of the HP and RP group consumed either high protein or standard foods. After 6 weeks of dietary intervention, HP and RP groups additionally started a strength training intervention twice per week for 8 weeks. Twenty-four hours dietary recalls were performed every 7-10 days. Body composition was assessed and blood taken. Plasma proteomics were assessed with LC-MS. RESULTS: Participants of the HP group doubled their baseline protein intake from 0.80 ± 0.31 to 1.63 ± 0.36 g/kg BW/d; RP increased protein intake from 0.89 ± 0.28 to 1.06 ± 0.26 g/kg BW/d. The CON group kept the protein intake stable throughout the study. Combined exercise and HP initiated notable changes, resulting in a reduction in bodyfat and increased muscle mass. Proteomics analyses revealed 14 significantly affected proteins by HP diet, regulating innate immune system, lipid transport and blood coagulation, yet the additional strength training did not elicit further changes. CONCLUSIONS: Combined HP and resistance exercise in healthy older adults seem to induce favorable changes in the body composition. Changes in the plasma proteome due to the high protein diet point to a beneficial impact for the innate immune system, lipid transport and blood coagulation system, all of which are involved in chronic disease development.

However, the application of IGIB on overweight or obese adults still needs further research to confirm its efficacy. (2) Methods: We retrospectively collected medical data from 1 July 2021 to 1 January 2022 from a total of 71 patients without diabetes who participated in the bariatric clinic with a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2. Forty-nine participants opted for intragastric botulinum injection (IGBI) using 300 units of botulinum injected into the antrum, body, and fundus, followed with a low-calorie high-protein diet course. Another 22 people participated only in the low-calorie high-protein diet course as a placebo group. This study analyzes the weight loss percentage of the two groups. Adverse events after IGBI are also reported in a safety assessment. (3) Results: In terms of the characteristics of the two groups, the mean BMI was 29.3 kg/m2 in the IGBI group and 28.0 kg/m in the placebo group (p = 0.63 without significant difference). Comparing the percent weight loss from baseline in the two groups after 12 weeks, the IGBI group lost 11.5% of their body weight and the placebo group lost 1.8%. In terms of group analysis, the percentages of participants with a weight reduction of at least 5% for the IGBI and placebo groups were 95% and 4%, respectively. For weight reduction of at least 10%, these values for the IGBI and placebo groups were 63% and 4%, respectively. In terms of adverse events after IGBI for 12 weeks, 12 participants (24.4%) had constipation, which was the main side effect. No serious adverse events were observed during the study period. (4) Conclusion: The combination of a low-calorie high-protein diet and IGBI is an effective and safe procedure in overweight or obese adults for weight reduction, but further larger studies are needed."

Methods: By using the block randomization method, the eligible participants were randomized into two groups. The first group received high-intensity aerobic training with a high-protein diet (Group A; n = 38) and the second group were allowed to do regular physical activities and eat a regular diet (Group B; n = 38) for 8 weeks. Clinical (basal metabolic index (BMI) and muscle-mass-cross-sectional area (CSA)) and biochemical (Adiponectin, leptin, TNF-α, and IL-6) measures were measured at baseline, on the 8th week, and at 6-months follow-up. Results: Baseline demographic and clinical attributes show homogenous presentation among the study groups (p > 0.05). After eight weeks of intervention, and at the end of 6-months follow-up, the basal metabolic index (BMI) (6.3) (CI 95% 4.71 to 7.88), mid-arm CSA (17) (CI 95% 14.70 to 19.29), mid-thigh CSA (13.10) (CI 95% 10.60 to 15.59), mid-calf CSA (11.3) (CI 95% 9.30 to 13.29), adiponectin (−1.9) (CI 95% −2.13 to −1.66), leptin (5.64) (CI 95% 5.50 to 5.77), TNF-α (0.5) (CI 95% 0.42 to 0.57), and IL-6 (0.21) (CI 95% 0.18 to 0.23) showed more improvement (p < 0.001) in Group A than Group B (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Overall, this trial found that high-intensity aerobic training with a high-protein diet decreased the BMI percentile and muscle mass (arm, thigh, and calf), and positively altered the biochemical variables in children with obesity.",

METHODS: 45 KM male mice were randomly divided into the control group, the high-fat and high-protein diet group, and the Baohe pill intervention group. The mice in the high-fat and high-protein diet group and the Baohe pill intervention group were fed with the self-made high-fat and high-protein diet as the sole food source of the mice, and the mice in the control group were fed with the normal diet. Starting from the 7th day of the feed intervention, mice in the Baohe pill intervention group were given 0.28 g/mL of Baohe pill decoction twice a day at the dose of 6.67 g/(kg·day), each time of 0.35 mL for 6 days. Mice in the control group and the high-fat and high-protein diet group were given the same amount of distilled water by gavage. The general state of mice in each group was observed, and the changes of intestinal microorganisms and intestinal enzyme activities were analyzed by culturable microorganism technology and intestinal functional enzyme detection technology. RESULTS: The excrement of mice fed with a high-fat and high-protein diet was relatively thin and wet, and the Baohe pill intervention could not improve the symptoms well. In the high-fat and high-protein diet group, the number of bacteria, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium, was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01). Baohe pills could obviously increase the high-fat, high-protein diet for the number of culturable microorganisms in mice, the total number of bacteria, and the number of Bifidobacteria in the most significant (P < 0.01), but the number of bacteria, Escherichia coli, and the Lactobacillus are still significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.01). In terms of enzyme activity, both contents and mucosa, the Baohe pill could improve the activities of amylase, protease, sucrase, and lactase in high-fat and high-protein diet mice, which were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05). In terms of microbial activity, the intestinal contents of high-fat and high-protein mice were lower than those of the control group, while the intestinal mucosa was higher than that of the control group, but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). Baohe pills could improve the intestinal contents and intestinal mucosal microbial activity of mice, and the difference was significant in the high-fat and high-protein diet group (P < 0.05). Discussion. A high-fat and high-protein diet can destroy the physiological balance of the body, which is mainly reflected in the disturbance of intestinal flora and the decrease of some enzyme activities and microbial activity. Baohe pills can restore the number of intestinal flora to a certain extent and improve the activities of various digestive enzymes including protease and amylase.",

Methods: This was a Meta-analysis. The randomized controlled trials on the effects of a high-protein diet on anthropometric indices and blood lipid in overweight and obese children published up to January 19, 2022 were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library and CNKI database, with the key words of \"child\" \"adolescent\" \"obesity\" \"overweight\" \"pediatric obesity\" \"weight loss\" \"dietary protein\" \"dietary carbohydrate\" \"caloric restrict\" both in English and Chinese. The quality of the included literature was evaluated according to the \"risk of bias\" assessment tool, which included bias from the randomization process, deviation from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome and selection of the reported results. Moreover, calculated the pooled mean difference, perform heterogeneity test, and assess publication bias. Results: A total of 8 articles were selected from the retrieved 4 836 articles, all in English. The sample sizes ranged from 4 to 120. The analysis showed that the post-intervention body mass index (mean difference (MD)=-0.66, 95%CI -1.76-0.44), body mass index Z-scores (MD=-0.09, 95%CI-0.23-0.05), fat content percentage (MD=-1.07, 95%CI-2.88-0.74), high density lipoprotein (MD=0.02, 95%CI-0.02-0.06) and low density lipoprotein (MD=0.04, 95%CI-0.08-0.17) were not significantly different with those of the standard protein diet group, with P values being 0.240, 0.220, 0.250, 0.360 and 0.480, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that after excluding one study, the difference in body mass index between the short-term intervention group and control group was statistically significant (MD=-1.60, 95%CI-3.14--0.06, P=0.040). Conclusions: A short-term high-protein diet intervention seems to improve the body mass index status of overweight and obese children. Nevertheless, a high-protein diet does not affect any other selected anthropometric indices and blood lipids. More studies with large sample sizes, higher quality and comparable standard of high-protein diet are needed for further demonstration.",

DESIGN: A single-center randomized parallel controlled trial. SETTING: Research University. PARTICIPANTS: Adult participants with chronic SCI (N=19, 3 years or more after the injury, C2-L2, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A-D). Participants were insulin resistant and had not received antibiotics within 4 weeks before enrolling in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to the LC/HP diet group (40% energy from carbohydrates, 30% energy from protein, and 30% energy from fat and met dietary guideline recommendations) or the control group for 8 weeks. Participants assigned to the LC/HP group were provided with all meals delivered weekly to their homes. Participants assigned to the control group were asked to continue their usual diet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stool samples were collected at baseline and the end of week 8. The gut microbiome 16S ribosomal RNA V4 region was sequenced, and gut microbiome diversity and taxonomical abundance were computed using the QIIME2 suite. RESULTS: Participants in the LC/HP group had significant changes in alpha-diversity (reduced operational taxonomic unit and Faith's phylogenetic diversity) and beta-diversity (unweighted UniFrac), while no significant differences were observed among participants in the control group after the intervention. Moreover, several taxa changed differently over time between groups, including increased Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Coprococcus 3, Fusicatenibacter, Tannerellaceae, and decreased Tyzzerella, Phascolarctobacterium, Romboutsia, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Hungatella, Ruminococcus gauvreauii, family XI, and Bacillales among participants in the diet group, while these taxa did not change in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: An LC/HP diet with healthy dietary components improved gut microbiome composition in individuals with SCI, including increased bacteria implicated in fiber metabolism and reduced bacteria communities linked to cardiometabolic disorders.",

However, there is still insufficient exploration on interaction within the gut microbiota under high-protein diet (HPD) intervention. We analyzed the gut microbial network and marker taxa from patients with Crohn's disease in public database (GMrepo, https://gmrepo.humangut.info) combined with investigation of the changes of composition and function of intestinal microbiome in mice fed on HPD by metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that there was an indirect negative correlation between Escherichia coli and Lachnospiraceae in patients with Crohn's disease, and Escherichia coli was a marker for both Crohn's disease and HPD intervention. Besides, enriched HH_1414 (one of the orthologs in eggNOG) related to tryptophan metabolism was from Helicobacter, whereas reduced orthologs (OGs) mainly contributed by Lachnospiraceae after HPD intervention. Our research indicates that some compositional changes in gut microbiota after HPD intervention are consistent with those in patients with Crohn's disease, providing insights into potential impact of altered gut microbes under HPD on Crohn's disease."

      "abstract": "A testosterone deficiency potentially increases osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms, and dietary protein and exercise affect them. However, their efficacy and their interactions are still unclear. We hypothesized that a high-protein diet (HPD) and regular exercise modulated OA symptoms in testosterone-deficient rats, and it was examined in bilateral orchidectomized (ORX) and monoiodoacetate (MIA)-injected rats. The ORX rats were given a 30 energy percent (En%) protein (HPD) or 17.5 En% protein (CD). Both groups had 39 En% fat in the diet. Non-ORX-CD rats (sham-operation of ORX) were given the CD and no exercise (normal control). After an eight-week intervention, all rats had an injection of MIA into the left knee, and the treatments were continued for an additional four weeks. The non-ORX-CD rats showed a significant increase in body weight compared to the ORX rats, but the ORX rats had elevated fat mass. ORX exacerbated the glucose tolerance by lowering the serum insulin concentrations and increasing insulin resistance. ORX exacerbated the OA symptoms more than the non-ORX-CD. The HPD and exercise improved bone mineral density and glucose metabolism without changing serum testosterone concentrations, while only exercise increased the lean body mass and decreased fat mass, lipid peroxide, and inflammation. Exercise, but not HPD, reduced the OA symptoms, the weight distribution in the left leg, and running velocity and provided better relief than the non-ORX-CD rats. Exercise with HPD improved the histology of the knee joint in the left leg. Exercise reduced lipid peroxide contents and TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA expression in the articular cartilage, while exercise with HPD decreased MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression as much as in the non-ORX-CD group. In conclusion, moderate aerobic exercise with HPD alleviated OA symptoms and articular cartilage degradation in a similar way in the non-ORX rats with OA by alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress."

In this study, male Wistar rats were fed two diets for 88 weeks: normal control diet (NCD, 20.5% of energy as protein) or HPD (30.5% of energy as protein). At 88 weeks intervention, compared to NCD rats, HPD rats had lower fat tissue and higher skeletal muscle to body weight ratio, but there were no significantly differences in body weight and food intake. To explore the mechanism underlying metabolism and diet, we further collected rat urine samples at 16, 40, 64 and 88 weeks diet treatment and analyzed metabolomics profiles using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) scores plots from ESI- or ESI+ model revealed a perfect separation between two diets at four time points. We identified 11 dramatically different metabolites (with VIP cut-off value > 1) in HPD, including 3 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated. And these 11 metabolites were identified as effective biomarkers, which were significantly related to HPD-induced metabolism related outcomes (fat tissue and skeletal muscle to body weight ratio). Our results provided vital information regarding metabolism in long-term HPD and more importantly, a few potentially promising metabolites were firstly identified which may related to metabolic responses.",

In a 21-day randomized controlled inpatient crossover feeding trial of 20 insulin-resistant obese women, we assessed the extent to which two isocaloric dietary interventions-Mediterranean (M) and high protein (HP)-improved metabolic parameters. Obese women were assigned to one of the following dietary sequences: M-HP or HP-M. Cardiometabolic parameters, body weight, glucose monitoring and gut microbiome composition were assessed. Sixteen women completed the study. Compared to the M diet, the HP diet was more effective in (i) reducing insulin resistance (insulin: Beta (95% CI) = -6.98 (-12.30, -1.65) µIU/mL, p = 0.01; HOMA-IR: -1.78 (95% CI: -3.03, -0.52), p = 9 × 10-3); and (ii) improving glycemic variability (-3.13 (-4.60, -1.67) mg/dL, p = 4 × 10-4), a risk factor for T2D development. We then identified a panel of 10 microbial genera predictive of the difference in glycemic variability between the two diets. These include the genera Coprococcus and Lachnoclostridium, previously associated with glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance. Our results suggest that morbidly obese women with insulin resistance can achieve better control of insulin resistance and glycemic variability on a high HP diet compared to an M diet.",

We hypothesized that a nutritional intervention designed to reduce aerobic glycolysis may boost the EGFR-directed antibody (Ab)-based therapy of pre-existing colitis-driven colorectal carcinoma (CRC). CRC development was induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administration to C57BL/6 mice. AOM/DSS-treated mice were fed a glucose-free, high-protein diet (GFHPD) or an isoenergetic control diet (CD) in the presence or absence of an i.p. injection of an anti-EGFR mIgG2a or respective controls. AOM/DSS-treated mice on a GFHPD displayed a reduced systemic glucose metabolism associated with reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex IV expression and diminished tumor loads. Comparable but not additive to an anti-EGFR-Ab therapy, the GFHPD was accompanied by enhanced tumoral goblet cell differentiation and decreased colonic PD-L1 and splenic CD3ε, as well as PD-1 immune checkpoint expression. In vitro, glucose-free, high-amino acid culture conditions reduced proliferation but improved goblet cell differentiation of murine and human CRC cell lines MC-38 and HT29-MTX in combination with down-regulation of PD-L1 expression. We here found GFHPD to systemically dampen glycolysis activity, thereby reducing CRC progression with a similar efficacy to EGFR-directed antibody therapy."

It is believed that transcriptional regulation is responsible for adaptation after HPD feeding and Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), a zinc finger transcription factor that has been proved to perform transcriptional regulation over amino acid, lipid and glucose metabolism, is known to be involved at least in part in this HPD response. To gain more insight into molecular mechanisms by which HPD controls expressions of genes involved in amino acid metabolism in the liver, we performed RNA-seq analysis of mice fed HPD for a short period (3 days). Compared to a low protein diet, HPD feeding significantly increased hepatic expressions of enzymes involved in the breakdown of all the 20 amino acids. Moreover, using KLF15 knockout mice and in vivo Ad-luc analytical system, we were able to identify Cth (cystathionine gamma-lyase) as a new target gene of KLF15 transcription as well as Ast (aspartate aminotransferase) as an example of KLF15-independent gene despite its remarkable responsiveness to HPD. These findings provide us with a clue to elucidate the entire transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of amino acid metabolic pathways.",

En (12.5 μM for the in-vitro study) protected the H9C2-cells against H2O2-induced cell apoptosis, whereas stepwise-increased H2O2 concentrations induced a significant increase in protein expressions of Mfn2/phosphorylated (p)-DRP1/mitochondrial-Bax in H9C2-cells. En downregulated H2O2-induced mitochondrial fission/upregulated mitochondrial fusion and deletion of Mfn2 gene (i.e., shMfn2) to significantly reduce H2O2-induced ROS production. En significantly suppressed and shMfn2 further significantly suppressed both H2O2-reduced mitochondrial-membrane potential and H2O2-induced ROS production/cell apoptosis/mitochondrial damage/mitochondrial-Bax released from mitochondria in H9C2 cells. En significantly reduced protein expressions of Mfn2 and p-DRP1. Additionally, En significantly suppressed and shMfn2 further significantly suppressed the protein expressions of mitochondrial-damaged (DRP1)/oxidative-stress (NOX-1/NOX-2)/apoptosis (mitochondrial-Bax/caspase-3/PARP)/autophagic (LC3B-II/LC3B-I) biomarkers (all p < 0.01). Rats were categorized into group 1 [sham-control + high-protein-diet (HPD)], group 2 (CRS + HPD) and group 3 (CRS+ HPD + En/100 mg/kg/day). By day 63 after CRS induction, the LVEF was significantly lower in group 3 and more significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1, whereas the protein expressions of oxidative-stress (NOX-1/NOX-2/p22phox/oxidized protein)/apoptotic (mitochondrial-Bax/caspase-3/PARP), fibrotic (Smad-3/TGF-ß), autophagic (Beclin-1/Atg5/ratio of LC3B-II/LC3B-I) and mitochondrial-damaged (DRP1/cyclophilin-D/cytosolic-cytochrome-C) biomarkers exhibited an opposite pattern of LVEF among the groups. Downregulation of Mfn2 by En or shMfn2 in cardiomyocytes avoided H2O2 damage and En improved the cardiac function in HPD-feeding CRS rat via adjusting Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial functional integrity.",

The middle-aged population is the age group with the highest prevalence of obesity. Thus, improving cardiometabolic health is important to prevent CVD and metabolic diseases in middle-aged obese adults. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of exercise alone or in combination with a high-protein diet on markers of cardiometabolic health in middle-aged adults with obesity. Methods: Sixty-nine middle-aged adults with obesity were assigned randomly to the control group (C; n = 23), exercise group (E; n = 23), or exercise combined with high-protein diet group (EP; n = 23). Individuals in the E and EP groups received supervised exercise training and individuals in the EP group received high-protein diet intervention. Body composition (assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), lipid profiles, and inflammatory markers were determined before and after 12 weeks of intervention. Insulin sensitivity index (ISI0,120) was calculated from values of fasting and 2-h insulin and glucose concentration of OGTT. Insulin-peak-time during the OGTT was recorded to reflect β-cell function. Analysis of covariance with baseline values as covariates was used to examine the effects of the intervention. The significant level was set at 0.05. Results: After 12 weeks of intervention, the E group had a greater percentage of individuals with early insulin-peak-time during the OGTT than that in the C and EP groups (p = 0.031). EP group had lower total cholesterol and triglycerides than that in the C group (p = 0.046 and 0.014, respectively). Within-group comparisons showed that the 2-h glucose of OGTT and C-reactive protein decreased in the EP group (p = 0.013 and 0.008, respectively) but not in the E and C groups; insulin sensitivity improved in the EP group (p = 0.016) and had a trend to improve in the E group (p = 0.052); and abdominal fat mass and total body fat mass decreased in both intervention groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Combined high-protein diet and exercise intervention significantly decreased fat mass and improved lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and inflammation in middle-aged adults with obesity.

In addition, the middle-aged population is often overlooked when talking about the prevention of sarcopenia. This study investigated the effects of exercise alone or in combination with a high-protein diet on muscle function and physical fitness in middle-aged obese adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine middle-aged (50-64 years old) obese adults were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control group (C; n=23), exercise group (E; n=23) or exercise plus high-protein group (EP; n=23). Individuals within the E and EP groups received 12 weeks of exercise training; whereas, the individuals in the EP group also received a high-protein diet intervention (1.6g/kg/day). Individuals within the C group were asked to maintain their lifestyle for 12 weeks. Participants were evaluated before and after the intervention. Outcome measures included maximal exercise capacity, muscle function and functional physical performance. Analysis of covariance was used to determine the effects of the intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, the E and EP groups had greater maximal work rate, peak oxygen consumption, and muscle power during muscle contractions at 180°/sec than that in the C group (P<0.05). The EP group, but not the E group, showed significant improvement in the sit-to-stand test and climbing stairs test than the C group after the intervention (P<0.05). Within group comparisons showed that the anaerobic threshold only increased in the EP group (+12% from pre-test).

We aimed to identify the effect of high-protein diets from different dietary proteins (casein, whey protein, soy protein) on experimental colitis and its impact on microbiota, structure and function of colonic mucus layer. METHODS: Female BALB/c mice were fed by standard diet, high-casein diet (HCD), high whey protein diet or high soy protein diet for 4 weeks. The susceptibility of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice and thickness of colonic mucus layer were compared after different dietary interventions, associated with the identification of the reversal effect of broad-spectrum antibiotic intervention (0.5 g/L of vancomycin and 1 g/L of neomycin sulfate, metronidazole and ampicillin in drinking water). Further analysis was performed on the synthesis of mucin, microbiota and sialidase involved in degradation of mucus layer. RESULTS: High-protein diets aggravated acute DSS-induced colitis independent of protein composition, while broad-spectrum antibiotics reversed this effect. HCD significantly altered the composition of bacteria in the colonic mucus layer, especially Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and total mucin-degrading bacteria; besides, it increased sialidase concentration and reduced the thickness of mucus layer. However, it exhibited no significant effect on the synthesis of Muc2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics decreased the abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria and sialidase concentration while increased the thickness of mucus layer. CONCLUSION: High-protein diet shifts microbial composition and thickness of colonic mucus layer, leading to the aggravation of acute DSS-induced colitis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Dietary strategies to promote successful aging are divergent. Higher-protein diets are recommended to preserve skeletal muscle mass and physical function. Conversely, increased B-vitamin intake, supporting one-carbon (1C) metabolism, reduces the risk of cognitive decline and cardiovascular disease. On the hypothesis that higher protein intake through animal-based sources will benefit 1C regulation by the supply of B vitamins (folate, riboflavin, and vitamins B6 and B12) and methyl donors (choline) despite higher methionine intake, this study explored the effect of a higher-protein diet on 1C metabolite status in older men compared to current protein recommendations. METHODS: Older men (age, 74 ± 3 y) were randomized to receive a diet for 10 wk containing either the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of protein (0.8 g/kg body weight/d, n = 14), or double that amount (2RDA, n = 15), with differences in protein accounted for by modifying carbohydrate intake. Intervention diets were matched to each individual's energy requirements based on the Harris-Benedict equation and adjusted fortnightly as required depending on physical activity and satiety. Fasting plasma 1C metabolite concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry at baseline and after 10 wk of intervention. RESULTS: Plasma homocysteine concentrations were reduced from baseline to follow-up with both diets. Changes in metabolite ratios reflective of betaine-dependent homocysteine remethylation were specific to the RDA diet, with an increase in the betaine-to-choline ratio and a decrease in the dimethylglycine-to-betaine ratio. Comparatively, increasing folate intake was positively associated with a change in choline concentration and inversely with the betaine-to-choline ratio for the 2RDA group. CONCLUSIONS: Adding to the known benefits of higher protein intake in older people, this study supports a reduction of homocysteine with increased consumption of animal-based protein, although the health effects of differential response of choline metabolites to a higher-protein diet remain uncertain.",

Therefore, the present study investigated a concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise training program in older adults, in the absence or presence of a high protein whole food-based dietary intervention, for effects on strength, physical function, and body composition. Community-dwelling older adults (n = 56; M/F, 28/28; age, 69.3 ± 4.0 years; BMI, 26.6 ± 3.7 kg m-2) participated in a 12-week intervention after randomization to either nutrition only (NUTR; n = 16), exercise only (EX, n = 19), or nutrition plus exercise (NUTR + EX, n = 21) groups. NUTR and NUTR + EX followed a dietary intervention targeting an increase in protein-rich meals at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Exercise training in EX and NUTR + EX consisted of 24 min sessions of concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise performed three times per week. Daily protein intake increased in NUTR and NUTR + EX, but not EX. The increase in 1RM leg press strength was greater (Interaction effect, P = 0.012) in NUTR + EX [29.6 (18.1, 41.0) kg] than increases observed in NUTR [11.1 (-1.3, 23.6) kg] and EX [12.3 (0.9, 23.8) kg]. The increase in 1RM chest press strength was greater (interaction effect, P = 0.031) in NUTR + EX [6.3 (4.0, 8.6) kg] than the increase observed in NUTR [2.9 (0.3, 5.5) kg], but not EX [6.3 (3.9, 8.7) kg]. Hand-grip strength and sit-to-stand performance were each improved in all three groups, with no differences observed between groups (interaction effect, P = 0.382 and P = 0.671, respectively). An increase in percentage body fat was observed in NUTR, but not in EX or NUTR + EX (interaction effect, P = 0.018). No between-group differences were observed for change in lean body mass (interaction effect, P = 0.402). Concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise training improves strength and physical function in older adults, but combining this training with an increase in daily protein intake through whole foods may be advantageous to increase lower limb strength."

The diets are known to alter energy metabolism, which can affect the quality of [18F]FDG PET heart images. In this preclinical study, we therefore explore the impact of a prolonged HP diet on myocardial [18F]FDG uptake. METHODS: C57BL/6J (Black six (Bl6)) and apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice were fed chow, a HP diet, or a low protein (LP) diet for 12 weeks. At baseline and after treatment, the animals were injected with 33.0 MBq of [18F]FDG and a 30 min PET/CT scan was made. Myocardial volume and [18F]FDG uptake were quantified using PET and the % of body fat was calculated from CT. RESULTS: Myocardial [18F]FDG uptake was similar for all diets at the follow-up scan but an increase between baseline and follow-up scans was noticed in the LP groups. Myocardial volume was significantly smaller in the C57BL HP group compared to the other Bl6 groups. Body weight increased less in the two HP groups compared to the chow and LP groups. Body fat percentage was significantly higher in the LP groups. This effect was stronger in C57BL mice (28.7%) compared to apoE-/- mice (15.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial uptake of [18F]FDG in mice is not affected by increased protein intake but [18F]FDG uptake increases when the amount of protein is lowered. A lower body weight and percentage of body fat were noticed when applying a HP diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe muscle mass (MM) loss is a defining feature of cancer observed across all types and stages of disease and is an independent predictor of poor clinical outcomes including higher incidences of chemotherapy toxicity and decreased survival. Protein is essential to build MM, yet the optimal amount for preventing or treating muscle loss in patients with cancer remains undefined. METHODS: The Protein Recommendation to Increase Muscle (PRIMe) study is a single-center, two-armed, parallel, randomized, controlled pilot trial that assesses the feasibility of utilizing a high protein (HP) diet to positively impact clinical outcomes in people undergoing chemotherapy to treat colorectal cancer. Forty patients with newly diagnosed stage II-IV colorectal cancer who are scheduled to receive chemotherapy will be included. Participants are randomly assigned to a HP or normal protein (NP) diet for twelve weeks. The HP and NP groups receive nutrition recommendations to achieve 2.0 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (g∙kg-1∙d-1) and 1.0 g⋅kg-1⋅d-1, respectively. These values refer to the upper and lower recommended range of protein intake for people with cancer. Energy recommendations are based on measured energy expenditure. Assessments are completed within two weeks of starting chemotherapy (baseline), at week 6, and at week 12. Changes to skeletal MM, physical function, anthropometrics, body composition, muscle strength, physical activity, energy metabolism, metabolic markers, nutritional status, quality of life, readiness to change and psychosocial determinants of behavioural change are assessed between the HP and NP groups. Feasibility of the nutritional intervention is assessed by change in MM as a surrogate marker. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence-based study investigates the feasibility of increasing protein intake following a diagnosis of cancer on clinical outcomes during treatment for colorectal cancer. This study will inform larger trials assessing the impact of increasing protein intake in cancer to determine their importance and integration into standard clinical care for people with cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High protein diet (HDP) promotes improvement of lean body mass in elderly without cancer; but the impact of high protein intake on muscle strength and mortality in cancer patients remains to be elucidated. This study evaluates the association between HPD on handgrip strength (HGS) and survival in older adults outpatients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. METHODS: Ninety-one patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer (>65% tumor stage III-IV) undergoing radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery were enrolled. Upon first oncological visit, tumor stage was assessed by a physician. Then, a nutritionist or a dietitian measured the body mass index (BMI), HGS by means of a dynamometer, and dietary food intake by using 24h food recall. Patients were stratified in HPD (i.e, ≥1.5 g/kg/d) or low protein diet (LPD: <1.5 g/kg/d). Kaplan-Meier curve was used to assess the survival since the cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: HPD was reported by approximately 30% of patients. Protein intake was significantly higher in HPD vs LPD patients (2.2 ± 0.8 vs. 0.8 ± 0.4 g/kg/d, respectively; p < 0.0001). No significant association was found between HPD and HGS, even after adjustment for physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking, sex, age, tumor stage, oncologic treatment and BMI (OR: 0.97 [95%CI: 0.88-1.08], p = 0.64), or for energy intake kcal/kg/day, leucine g/d and lipids g/d (OR: 0.93 [95%CI: 0.85-1.03, p = 0.19]. In addition, HPD group showed higher overall survival than LPD group (HPD: 14.7 vs. LPD: 7.3 months, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: HPD is not associated with better muscle function as measured by HGS, but with overall survival in older adults outpatients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. HPD may represent a strategy to mitigate the cancer-induced mortality and should be further explored.",

We hypothesised that a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet would reduce GV acutely in patients with T2D compared with a conventional diabetes (CD) diet. METHODS: In this controlled, randomised crossover study, 16 patients with metformin-treated T2D (median (IQR) age: 64.0 (58.8-68.0) years; HbA1c: 47 (43-57) mmol/mol; duration of T2D: 5.5 (2.8-10.3) years) were assigned to an energy-matched CRHP diet and CD diet (31E%/54E% carbohydrate, 29E%/16E% protein and 40E%/30E% fat, respectively) for two separate 48-h intervention periods. Interstitial continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed to assess accepted measures of glycaemic variability, i.e. standard deviation (SD) around the sensor glucose level; coefficient of variation in percent (CV); mean amplitude of glucose excursions (MAGE); continuous overlapping net glycaemic action (CONGA1, CONGA4) of observations 1 and 4 h apart; and mean absolute glucose (MAG) change. RESULTS: All indices of glycaemic variability (mean ± SD) were significantly reduced during CRHP diet compared with CD diet; including SD (1.0 ± 0.3 (CRHP) vs 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/L (CD)), CV (12.3 ± 3.8 vs 19.3 ± 5.5%), MAGE (2.3 ± 0.9 vs 4.2 ± 1.3 mmol/L), CONGA1 (0.8 ± 0.3 vs 1.5 ± 0.4 mmol/L), CONGA4 (1.4 ± 0.5 vs 2.5 ± 0.8 mmol/L), and MAG change (0.9 ± 0.3 vs 1.4 ± 0.4 mmol/L/h) (p < 0.001 for all). Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet improved the diurnal glucose profile by reducing 24-h mean sensor glucose (7.7 ± 1.6 vs 8.6 ± 2.0 mmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: In T2D patients treated with diet and metformin, two days of iso-energetic replacement of dietary carbohydrates by protein and fat reduced all indices of glycaemic variability by 36%-45% when compared with a conventional diabetes diet. These data may support reduction of carbohydrates as dietary advice for T2D patients. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02472951.",

METHODS: Using a double-blind, independent group design, 10 males and eight females (age 57 ± 4 years; mass 72.3 ± 5.6 kg; height 1.7 ± 6.5 m) were supplied with a higher protein (2.50 g·kg-1·day-1) or moderate protein (1.25 g·kg-1·day-1) diet for 48 hr after 140 squats with 25% of their body mass. Maximal isometric voluntary contractions, muscle soreness, creatine kinase, Brief Assessment of Mood Adapted, and inflammatory markers were measured preexercise, and 24 hr and 48 hr postexercise. RESULTS: The maximal isometric voluntary contractions decreased postexercise (p = .001, ηp2=.421), but did not differ between groups (p = .822, ηp2=.012). Muscle soreness peaked at 24 hr post in moderate protein (44 ± 30 mm) and 48 hr post in higher protein (70 ± 46 mm; p = .005; ηp2=.282); however, no group differences were found (p = .585; ηp2=.083). Monocytes and lymphocytes significantly decreased postexercise, and eosinophils increased 24 hr postexercise (p < 0.05), but neutrophils, creatine kinase, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and Brief Assessment of Mood Adapted were unchanged by exercise or the intervention (p > .05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, 2.50 g·kg-1·day-1 of protein is not more effective than 1.25 g·kg-1·day-1 for attenuating indirect markers of muscle damage and inflammation following strenuous exercise in older adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The proportion of older citizens is increasing worldwide. A well-known syndrome in old age is physical frailty which is associated with a greater risk of disabilities in activities of daily living, greater reliance on in-home services, hospitalization, institutionalization, and premature mortality. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of an intervention with high-protein diet alone or in combination with power training in pre-frail and frail old adults. METHODS: The study is a community-based assessor-blinded parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT), consisting of two phases. Phase 1 is a 1-month stabilization phase, where self-reliant community-dwelling adults + 80 years old will receive individual guidance regarding protein intake, to prevent the risk of negative protein balance prior to phase 2 and to only include participants who have reached the minimum recommended level of protein intake (1.0 g/kg/day) in the randomized controlled trial. Phase 2 is a 4-month RCT where 150 participants will be randomized into the following three arms: protein-only where participants will be provided with dairy products to increase their protein intake to 1.5 g/kg/day, protein + exercise where participants will be provided with the protein intervention in combination with power training two times a week, and recommendation group where participants will continue as in phase 1. Primary outcome is lower leg muscle power. Secondary outcomes include physical function and mobility, frailty status, muscle mechanical function, body composition, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life. The statistical analysis will include an intention-to-treat analysis of all randomized participant and per-protocol analysis of all compliant participants. The study hypothesis will be tested with mixed linear models to assess changes in the main outcomes over time and between study arms. DISCUSSION: The finding of this study may add to the knowledge about the beneficial effects of high-protein diet from dairy products combined with power training to counteract frailty in community-dwelling older adults. This may ultimately have an impact on the ability to live well and independent for longer. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03842579 . Registered on 15 February 2019, version 1.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming increasingly prevalent and nutrition intervention remains the most important therapeutic approach for NAFLD. Our aim was to investigate whether low- (LP) or high-protein (HP) diets are more effective in reducing liver fat and reversing NAFLD and which mechanisms are involved. METHODS: 19 participants with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery were randomized into two hypocaloric (1500-1600 kcal/day) diet groups, a low protein (10E% protein) and a high protein (30E% protein), for three weeks prior to surgery. Intrahepatic lipid levels (IHL) and serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) were measured before and after the dietary intervention. Autophagy flux, histology, mitochondrial activity and gene expression analyses were performed in liver samples collected during surgery. RESULTS: IHL levels decreased by 42.6% in the HP group, but were not significantly changed in the LP group despite similar weight loss. Hepatic autophagy flux and serum FGF21 increased by 66.7% and 42.2%, respectively, after 3 weeks in the LP group only. Expression levels of fat uptake and lipid biosynthesis genes were lower in the HP group compared with those in the LP group. RNA-seq analysis revealed lower activity of inflammatory pathways upon HP diet. Hepatic mitochondrial activity and expression of β-oxidation genes did not increase in the HP group. CONCLUSIONS: HP diet more effectively reduces hepatic fat than LP diet despite of lower autophagy and FGF21. Our data suggest that liver fat reduction upon HP diets result primarily from suppression of fat uptake and lipid biosynthesis.",

However, there are several case reports of rhabdomyolysis after WB-EMS application. Thus, we asked if this training could potentially lead to deteriorations of the cardiac as well as the renal function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sarcopenic obese men aged 70 years and older were randomly balanced (1-1-1) and allocated to one of the three study arms. During 16 weeks of intervention, these groups either performed WB-EMS and took a protein supplement (WB-EMS&P), solely received the protein supplement (Protein) or served as control group (CG). WB-EMS consisted of 1.5×20 min (85 Hz, 350 μs, 4 s of strain to 4 s of rest) applied with moderate-to-high intensity while moving. We further generated a daily protein intake of 1.7-1.8 g/kg/body mass per day. At baseline and 8-10 days after completion of the intervention, blood was drawn and biomarkers of muscle, cardiac and renal health were assessed. RESULTS: Hereby, we found slight but significant elevations of creatine kinase (CK) levels in the WB-EMS group pointing to minor damages of the skeletal muscle (140 U/l [81-210], p < 0.001). This was accompanied by a significant, low-grade increase of creatine kinase-muscle brain (CK-MB, 0.43 ng/mL [-0.29-0.96], p < 0.01) and high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT, 0.001 ng/mL. [0.000-0.003], p < 0.001) but without a higher risk of developing heart failure according to N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, -5.7 pg/mL [-38.8-24.6], p = 0.17). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was impaired neither by the high-protein supplementation alone nor in combination with WB-EMS (CG 76.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 [71.9-82.2] vs Protein 73.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 [63.0-78.9] vs WB-EMS&P 74.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 [62.8-84.1], p = 0.478). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, even in the vulnerable group of sarcopenic obese seniors, the combination of WB-EMS with a high-protein intake revealed no short-term, negative impact on the eGFR, but potential consequences for the cardiovascular system need to be addressed in future studies.",

This study sought to compare the effects of UA and a placebo on muscle strength and mass in young men undergoing resistance training (RT) and consuming a high-protein diet. METHODS: A clinical, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted for 8 weeks. The Control + RT group (CON n = 12) received 400 mg/d of placebo, and the UA + RT group (UA n = 10) received 400 mg/d of UA. Both groups ingested ~1.6 g/kg of protein and performed the same RT program. Pre- and post-intervention, both groups were evaluated for anthropometric measures, body composition, food intake and muscle strength. RESULTS: Food intake remained unchanged throughout the study. Both groups showed significant increases in body weight (CON Δ: 2.12 ± 0.47 kg, p = 0.001 vs. UA Δ: 2.24 ± 0.67 kg, p = 0.009), body mass index (BMI) (CON Δ: 0.69 ± 0.15 kg/m2, p = 0.001 vs. UA Δ: 0.75 ± 0.23, p = 0.011) and thigh circumference (CON Δ: 1.50 ± 0.36, p = 0.002 vs. UA Δ: 2.46 ± 0.50 cm, p = 0.003 vs. UA 1.84 ± 0.82 cm, p = 0.001), with differences between them. There was no difference in the arm, waist and hip circumferences. Both groups showed increases in muscle mass (CON Δ: 1.12 ± 0.26, p = 0.001 vs. UA Δ: 1.08 ± 0.28 kg, p = 0.004), but there was no significant difference between them. Additionally, there were significant increases in the one repetition maximum test in the bench press and in the 10-repetition maximum test in the knee extension (CON Δ: 5.00 ± 2.09, p = 0.036 vs. UA Δ: 7.8 ± 1.87, p = 0.340 and CON Δ: 3.58 ± 1.15, p = 0.010 vs. UA Δ: 1.20 ± 0.72, p = 0.133), respectively, with no difference between them.

In this clinical trial, fifty NWO women were randomly allocated to HP (n 25) or SP (n 25) diet groups. Women in the HP and SP groups consumed 25 and 15 % of their total energy intake from protein for 12 weeks. Weight, fat mass (FM), lean body mass (LBM), waist circumference (WC) and appetite were evaluated at baseline and following their 3-month intervention. After 12 weeks, the LBM was higher in HP compared with no significant changes in the SP group (mean between-group difference = 1·5 kg; 95 % CI 3·1, 0·01; effect size (d) = 0·4). Furthermore, the HP group had lower FM (mean between-group difference -1·1 kg; 95 % CI 1, -3·3; d = -0·2), body fat percentage (BFP) (mean between-group difference -2 %; 95 % CI 0·7, -5·2; d = -0·3) and WC (mean between-group difference -1·4 cm; 95 % CI 0·6, -3·6; d = -0·2) at the end of the study in comparison with the SP group. In both groups, weight and appetite were unchanged over time without significant differences between groups. Twelve weeks of euenergetic diets with different dietary protein contents resulted in no significant weight loss in women with NWO. However, an HP diet significantly improved body composition (LBM, FM, BFP and WC) in this population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Late onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a lysosomal neuromuscular disorder which can progressively impair the patients' exercise tolerance, motor and respiratory functions, and quality of life. The available enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) does not completely counteract disease progression. We investigated the effect of exercise training alone, or associated with a high-protein diet, on the exercise tolerance, muscle and pulmonary functions, and quality of life of LOPD patients on long term ERT. METHODS: The patients were asked to participate to a crossover randomized study comprehending a control period (free diet, no exercise) followed by 2 intervention periods: exercise or exercise + diet, each lasting 26 weeks and separated by 13 weeks washout periods. Exercise training included moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer, stretching and balance exercises, strength training. The diet was composed by 25-30% protein, 30-35% carbohydrate and 35-40% fat. Before and after each period patients were assessed for: exercise tolerance test on a cycle-ergometer, serum muscle enzymes, pulmonary function tests and SF36 questionnaire for quality of life. Compliance was evaluated by training and dietary diaries. Patients were contacted weekly by researchers to optimize adherence to treatments. RESULTS: Thirteen LOPD patients, median age 49 ± 11 years, under chronic ERT (median 6.0 ± 4.0 years) were recruited. Peak aerobic power (peak pulmonary O2 uptake) decreased after control, whereas it increased after exercise, and more markedlyafter exercise + diet. Serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) significantly decreased after exercise + diet; both creatine kinase (CK) and LDH levels were significantly reduced after exercise + diet compared to exercise. Pulmonary function showed no changes after control and exercise, whereas a significant improvement of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) was observed after exercise + diet. SF36 showed a slight improvement in the \"mental component\" scale after exercise, and a significant improvement in \"general health\" and \"vitality\" after exercise + diet. The compliance to prescriptions was higher than 70% for both diet and exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise tolerance (as evaluated by peak aerobic power) showed a tendency to decrease in LOPD patients on long term ERT. Exercise training, particularly if combined with high-protein diet, could reverse this decrease and result in an improvement, which was accompanied by improved quality of life. The association of the two lifestyle interventions resulted also in a reduction of muscle enzyme levels and improved pulmonary function.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Resistance training combined with consumption of a high-protein diet (HPD) is typically recommended to increase muscle mass, as both acute resistance exercise (RE) and dietary protein intake stimulate mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and muscle protein synthesis (MPS). However, the effect of chronic HPD consumption on MPS response to an acute RE remains to be determined. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 10 wk were fed HPD (50 kcal % protein, for 4 wk) or normal protein diet (NPD; 20 kcal % protein). After the 4-wk dietary intervention, the rats were fasted overnight and the right gastrocnemius muscle was subjected to percutaneous electrical stimulation to mimic acute RE, whereas the left gastrocnemius muscle served as control. The rats were sacrificed 6 h after exercise and the tissues were sampled immediately. RESULTS: The HPD group showed significantly lower fat mass and higher skeletal muscle mass than the NPD group without affecting body weight. Resting mTORC1 activity did not differ between the groups. Additionally, resting MPS was also unchanged after HPD. Acute RE significantly increased mTORC1 activity and MPS in both groups. However, differences in diet did not influence the response of mTORC1 activation to acute RE. Furthermore, HPD did not affect the response of MPS to acute RE. CONCLUSION: The present results suggested that although 4 wk of HPD reduces body fat and increases skeletal muscle mass, it does not affect muscle protein synthesis at basal state, and in response to acute RE.",

      "abstract": "An unfavorable lipid profile and being overweight are known mediators in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The effect of diet, particularly high in protein, remains under discussion. Therefore, this study examines the effects of a high-protein (HP) diet on cardiometabolic health and vascular function (i.e., endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and retinal microvascular structure), and the possible association with plasma endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-related compounds in overweight participants. Thirty-eight participants (64.5 ± 5.9 (mean ± SD) years; body mass index (BMI) 28.9 ± 4.0 kg/m2) were measured for 48 h in a respiration chamber after body-weight maintenance for approximately 34 months following weight reduction. Diets with either a HP (n = 20) or moderate protein (MP; n = 18) content (25%/45%/30% vs. 15%/55%/30% protein/carbohydrate/fat) were provided in energy balance. Validated markers for cardiometabolic health (i.e., office blood pressure (BP) and serum lipoprotein concentrations) and vascular function (i.e., brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation, pulse wave analysis and velocity, and retinal microvascular calibers) were measured before and after those 48 h. Additionally, 24 h ambulatory BP, plasma anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and pregnenolone (PREG) were analyzed throughout the day. Office and ambulatory BP, serum lipoprotein concentrations, and vascular function markers were not different between the groups. Only heart rate (HR) was higher in the HP group. HR was positively associated with OEA, while OEA and PEA were also positively associated with total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. Vascular function markers were not associated with endocannabinoids (or endocannabinoid-related substances). In conclusion, the HP diet did not affect cardiometabolic health and vascular function in overweight participants after completing a weight-loss intervention. Furthermore, our data indicate a possible association between OEA and PEA with TC and LDL cholesterol.",

      "abstract": "Carbohydrate-restricted diets are increasingly recognized as options for dietary management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We investigated the effects of a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) and a conventional diabetes (CD) diet on oxidative stress and inflammation in weight stable individuals with T2DM. We hypothesized that the CRHP diet would improve markers of oxidatively generated RNA and DNA modifications as well as inflammatory parameters. Thirty participants with T2DM were randomized to 6 weeks of CRHP or CD dietary treatment (30/50 energy percentage (E%) carbohydrate, 30/17E% protein, 40/33E% fat), followed by a cross-over to the opposite diet for a subsequent 6-week period. All meals were provided during the study and body weight was controlled. Diurnal urine samples were collected after 4 weeks on each diet and oxidatively generated RNA and DNA modifications were measured as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), respectively. Fasting concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 were measured before and after 6 weeks of interventions. Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet increased 24-hour urinary excretion of 8-oxoGuo by 9.3% (38.6 ± 12.6 vs. 35.3 ± 11.0 nmol/24 h, p = .03), whereas 8-oxodG did not differ between diets (24.0 ± 9.5 vs. 24.8 ± 11.1 nmol/24 h, p = .17). Changes in plasma inflammatory parameters did not differ between CRHP and CD diets, all p ≥ .2. The clinical implications of increased RNA oxidation following a CRHP diet as well as long-term effects of carbohydrate-restriction on markers of oxidatively generated nucleic acid modifications should be a field of future study.",

However, none of these studies combined this procedure with a calorie-restricting high-protein diet. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effects of IG-BTxA application combined with a calorie-restricting high-protein diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study is conducted with eighty-seven grade 2 obese patients treated between January 2019 and August 2019. Group 1: IG-BTxA + refused to consult the dietitian; group 2: IG-BTxA + get calorie-restricting high-protein diet; group 3: only get a calorie-restricting high-protein diet. Loss of weight, treatment adaptation (visual analog scale score), the status and changes of comorbid conditions, and changes in eating behaviors (Self-Regulation of Eating Behaviour Questionnaire score) were assessed. RESULTS: Loss of weight, treatment adaptation, and positive behavioral change in eating preferences were significantly higher in group 2 (p = 0.01; p = 0.001; p < 0.01, respectively). Additionally, the decrease in medication requirement for diabetes and hypertension was higher in group 2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IG-BTxA application before calorie-restricting high-protein diet facilitates adaptation to the new diet style and helps to lose weight faster in grade 2 obese patients. Also, more positive results were achieved in terms of controlling comorbid diseases.",

Experiments were carried out on 8-week-old Wistar albino male rats (n = 64) weighing 200 ± 20 g. By dietary and pharmacological treatment, all animals were divided into 8 groups: 1. CTRL group; 2. CTRL + OLZ group; 3. CTRL + FA group; 4. CTRL + OLZ + FA group; 5. PD group; 6. PD + OLZ group; 7. PD + FA group; 8. PD + OLZ + FA group. After 6 weeks of pharmacological/diet treatment, all animals were sacrificed to collect blood samples and determine the biomarkers of oxidative stress. The following oxidative stress markers were measured spectrophotometrically: superoxide anion radical (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO-), index of lipid peroxidation measured as TBARS, reduced glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase. The study has shown that Olanzapine treatment was associated with increased release of pro-oxidants and diminished activity of anti-oxidant markers. Additional supplementation with PD and FA succeeded in abolishing the negative influence in most of the measured parameters. However, these beneficial impacts were stronger in the case of their separate application, which could be the practical and clinical importance of these results.",

However, high-protein diets (HPDs) including animal-sourced foods may negatively perturb the microbiota, and provision of probiotics and prebiotics may mitigate these effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of HPD, with and without a probiotic and/or prebiotic, on gut microbiota and wellness in older women. DESIGN: We conducted an 18-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were healthy, older women (mean age±standard deviation=73.7±5.6 years; n=26) recruited from Florida. INTERVENTION: Participants received a weight-maintenance HPD for 2-week periods and the following, in random order: HPD alone (1.5 to 2.2 g/kg/day protein); HPD plus multistrain probiotic formulation (1.54×109Bifidobacterium bifidum HA-132, 4.62×109Bifidobacterium breve HA-129, 4.62×109Bifidobacterium longum HA-135, 4.62×109Lactobacillus acidophilus HA-122, and 4.62×109Lactobacillus plantarum HA-119), HPD plus prebiotic (5.6 g inulin), and HPD plus synbiotic (probiotic plus inulin), separated by 2-week washouts. Stools were collected per period for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (strain recovery) and 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses (microbiota profile). Measures of gastrointestinal and general wellness were assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microbiota composition and probiotic strain recovery were measured. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Microbiota composition was analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test and t test. Secondary outcomes were analyzing using generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: The microbiota profile demonstrated relative stability with the HPD; representation of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus were enhanced, whereas butyrate producers, Roseburia and Anaerostipes, were suppressed. Lactococcus was suppressed with synbiotic vs other HPD periods. Recovery was confirmed for all probiotic strains. Indicators of wellness were unchanged, with the exception of a minimal increase in gastrointestinal distress with inulin. Fat-free mass increased from baseline to study end. CONCLUSIONS: An HPD adhering to the recommended acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges maintains wellness in healthy older women and exerts minor perturbations to the microbiome profile, a group that may benefit from a higher protein intake.

RESULTS: Mitogen-stimulated proliferative activity of blood leukocytes revealed a quadratic effect for the dietary supplementation of arginine (P = .02) and ornithine (P = .03) (means for ConA-stimulation: w/o = 6.96; Arg 1 = 9.31; Arg 2 = 11.4; Arg 3 = 8.04; Orn 1 = 15.4; Orn 2 = 9.43; Orn 3 = 9.28; pooled SEM: 0.96). The number (% gated) of phagocytic granulocytes linearly decreased with increasing dietary concentrations of arginine (P = .05) and ornithine (P = .03) (means: w/o = 95.5; Arg 1 = 93.0; Arg 2 = 92.5; Arg 3 = 92.6; Orn 1 = 92.6; Orn 2 = 92.6; Orn 3 = 91.5; pooled SEM = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study could demonstrate immunomodulating properties of dietary arginine and ornithine in cats.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has a peripheral to central distribution in adults, higher in peripheral bones. Similarly, the spine has a caudal to cephalad MAT distribution, higher in lumbar vertebras. Diet and the level of physical activities are known modulators of MAT with significant impact on bone; however, whether these can modulate the MAT gradient is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of high protein diet and bed rest interventions on the lumbar MAT gradient. DESIGN PARTICIPANTS INTERVENTION: In a prospective randomized crossover trial, 10 healthy men participated in 2 consecutive campaigns of 21days head-down-tilt-bed-rest (HDTBR). They received either whey protein and potassium bicarbonate-supplemented or control diet separated by a 4-month washout period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ten serial MRI measures of lumbar vertebral fat fraction (VFF) were performed at baseline, 10days and 20days of HDTBR and 3 and 28days after HDTBR of each bed rest campaign. RESULTS: The mean L5-L1 VFF difference of 4.2 ± 1.2 percentage point higher at L5 (p = 0.008) constituted a caudal to cephalad lumbar MAT gradient. High protein diet did not alter the lumbar VFF differences during both HDTBR campaigns (all time points p > 0.05). Similarly, 2 campaigns of 21days of HDTBR did not change the lumbar VFF differences (all time points p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study established that the lumbar vertebral MAT gradient was not altered by a high protein nor by 2 × 21days bed rest interventions. These findings demonstrated that this lack of mechanical stimulus was not an important modulator of the lumbar MAT gradient. The highly preserved MAT gradient needs to be measured in more situations of health and disease and may potentially serve to detect pathological situations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a well-known risk factor of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and it is commonly accompanied by T2DM. It is estimated that almost two thirds of the population with T2DM is also affected by hypertension. Elevated arterial blood pressure would increase the risk for diabetes development. Recently some studies indicated that a high-protein diet was effective for weight loss, and therefore we hypothesized that a high-protein diet could help control blood glucose, mitigate insulin resistance (IR) and improve blood pressure by weight management in T2DM patients. AIM: The study aimed to systematically review the effects of a high-protein diet on glycemic control, IR and blood pressure in T2DM patients. METHODS: We searched four electronic databases until May 1st 2018 and included all randomized clinical trials comparing a high-protein diet with other diets. Two reviewers independently identified the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data. Either a fixed- or a random-effects model was used to combine the changes in each outcome from baseline to the end of the intervention. The meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: Twelve articles (thirteen studies) including 1138 T2DM patients met our inclusion criteria. Glycemic control was not significantly different between the high-protein diet and control group, with the changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (-0.13 (95% CI (-0.46, 0.19), p = 0.43) mmol/L) and HbA1c% (-0.05 (95% CI (-0.18, 0.08, p = 0.92))) from baseline to the end of intervention. However, the difference in IR between the two groups was statistically significant. Most changes in lipids profiles were favorable. The changes in HDL, LDL, TC, and TG were +0.03 (95% CI (-0.04,0.11), p = 0.35) mmol/L, -0.10 (95% CI (-0.18, -0.02), p = 0.02) mmol/L, -0.21 (95% CI (-0.31, -0.12), p < 0.01) mmol/L and -0.19 (95% CI (-0.33, -0.05), p < 0.01) mmol/L, respectively. The result of HOMA-IR was -0.27 (95% CI (-0.47, -0.06), p < 0.01). Additionally, the difference in blood pressure in terms of systolic blood pressure (-0.57 (95% CI (-2.45, 1.32), p = 0.55)) and diastolic blood pressure (-0.73 (95% CI (-2.48, 1.02), p = 0.41)) was not significant. CONCLUSION: This review showed that a high-protein diet does not significantly improve glycemic control and blood pressure, but can lower LDL, TC, TG and HOMA-IR levels in T2DM patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of a high-protein diet on glycemic control, IR and blood pressure control in T2DM patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: After proteolysis, the majority of released amino acids from dietary protein are transported to the liver for gluconeogenesis or to peripheral tissues where they are used for protein synthesis and eventually catabolized, producing ammonia as a byproduct. High ammonia levels in the brain are a major contributor to the decreased neural function that occurs in several pathological conditions such as hepatic encephalopathy when liver urea cycle function is compromised. Therefore, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of human ammonia metabolism. The objective of this study was to predict changes in blood ammonia levels resulting from alterations in dietary protein intake, from liver disease, or from partial loss of urea cycle function. METHODS: A simple mathematical model was created using MATLAB SimBiology and data from published studies. Simulations were performed and results analyzed to determine steady state changes in ammonia levels resulting from varying dietary protein intake and varying liver enzyme activity levels to simulate liver disease. As a toxicity reference, viability was measured in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells following differentiation and ammonium chloride treatment. RESULTS: Results from control simulations yielded steady state blood ammonia levels within normal physiological limits. Increasing dietary protein intake by 72% resulted in a 59% increase in blood ammonia levels. Simulations of liver cirrhosis increased blood ammonia levels by 41 to 130% depending upon the level of dietary protein intake. Simulations of heterozygous individuals carrying a loss of function allele of the urea cycle carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) gene resulted in more than a tripling of blood ammonia levels (from roughly 18 to 60 μM depending on dietary protein intake). The viability of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells was decreased by 14% by the addition of a slightly higher amount of ammonium chloride (90 μM). CONCLUSIONS: Data from the model suggest decreasing protein consumption may be one simple strategy to decrease blood ammonia levels and minimize the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy for many liver disease patients. In addition, the model suggests subjects who are known carriers of disease-causing CPS1 alleles may benefit from monitoring blood ammonia levels and limiting the level of protein intake if ammonia levels are high.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic disorders (e.g., impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes) are more prevalent in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) than able-bodied individuals. Dietary modification is a more cost-effective treatment option than pharmacological therapies for reducing the risk of metabolic dysfunction. Lowering carbohydrate, increasing protein, and maintaining a proper dietary fat intake are expected to induce favorable adaptations in glucose control, body fat distribution, and the composition of the gut microbiome. However, dietary modification has not been rigorously investigated in people with SCI. The purpose of this study is to determine if an 8-week low-carbohydrate/high-protein (LC/HP) dietary intervention will show improvements in clinically important metrics of metabolic function, body composition, the composition of gut bacteria, and quality of life. METHODS/DESIGN: We intend to recruit 100 participants with chronic traumatic SCI (3 years postinjury, C5-L2, American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale A-D, and aged 18-65 years) and insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance or untreated type 2 diabetes and randomly assign them to an 8-week LC/HP dietary intervention group or a control group. The daily LC/HP dietary intervention includes ~ 30% total energy as protein (1.6 g/kg per day) with a carbohydrate-to-protein ratio < 1.5 and fat intake set at ~ 30% of the total energy intake. The control group does not receive any dietary intervention and are continuing with their regular daily diets. Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, body composition, gut microbiome composition, and quality of life measures are assessed at week 1, before starting the LC/HP dietary intervention, and at week 8, after completion of the LC/HP dietary intervention. DISCUSSION: New information derived from this project will result in the development of a low-cost, simple, self-administered LC/HP dietary intervention for improving metabolic function in individuals with chronic SCI, improved understanding of the composition of gut bacteria in SCI, and how a LC/HP dietary intervention alters gut bacteria composition. In addition, this project will improve our understanding of the relationship between metabolic function and quality of life in individuals with long-standing SCI.

      "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Dietary recommendations for treating type 2 diabetes are unclear but a trend towards recommending a diet reduced in carbohydrate content is acknowledged. We compared a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet with an iso-energetic conventional diabetes (CD) diet to elucidate the effects on glycaemic control and selected cardiovascular risk markers during 6 weeks of full food provision of each diet. METHODS: The primary outcome of the study was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes reported in the present paper include glycaemic variables, ectopic fat content and 24 h blood pressure. Eligibility criteria were: men and women with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c 48-97 mmol/mol (6.5-11%), age >18 years, haemoglobin >6/>7 mmol/l (women/men) and eGFR >30 ml min-1 (1.73 m)-2. Participants were randomised by drawing blinded ballots to 6 + 6 weeks of an iso-energetic CRHP vs CD diet in an open label, crossover design aiming at body weight stability. The CRHP/CD diets contained carbohydrate 30/50 energy per cent (E%), protein 30/17E% and fat 40/33E%, respectively. Participants underwent a meal test at the end of each diet period and glycaemic variables, lipid profiles, 24 h blood pressure and ectopic fat including liver and pancreatic fat content were assessed at baseline and at the end of each diet period. Data were collected at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants completed the study. Fourteen participants carried out 6 weeks of the CRHP intervention followed by 6 weeks of the CD intervention, and 14 participants received the dietary interventions in the reverse order. Compared with a CD diet, a CRHP diet reduced the primary outcome of HbA1c (mean ± SEM: -6.2 ± 0.8 mmol/mol (-0.6 ± 0.1%) vs -0.75 ± 1.0 mmol/mol (-0.1 ± 0.1%); p < 0.001). Nine (out of 37) pre-specified secondary outcomes are reported in the present paper, of which five were significantly different between the diets, (p < 0.05); compared with a CD diet, a CRHP diet reduced the secondary outcomes (mean ± SEM or medians [interquartile range]) of fasting plasma glucose (-0.71 ± 0.20 mmol/l vs 0.03 ± 0.23 mmol/l; p < 0.05), postprandial plasma glucose AUC (9.58 ± 0.29 mmol/l × 240 min vs 11.89 ± 0.43 mmol/l × 240 min; p < 0.001) and net AUC (1.25 ± 0.20 mmol/l × 240 min vs 3.10 ± 0.25 mmol/l × 240 min; p < 0.001), hepatic fat content (-2.4% [-7.8% to -1.0%] vs 0.2% [-2.3% to 0.9%]; p < 0.01) and pancreatic fat content (-1.7% [-3.5% to 0.6%] vs 0.5% [-1.0% to 2.0%]; p < 0.05). Changes in other secondary outcomes, i.e. 24 h blood pressure and muscle-, visceral- or subcutaneous adipose tissue, did not differ between diets. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A moderate macronutrient shift by substituting carbohydrates with protein and fat for 6 weeks reduced HbA1c and hepatic fat content in weight stable individuals with type 2 diabetes.

      "abstract": "The widely used db/db mouse as a model of diabetic nephropathy (DN) only mimics the early changes in human DN with a slow disease progression. Since high protein diet (HPD) has been reported to affect progression of nephropathy in both humans and mice, we investigated whether HPD could accelerate nephropathy in db/db mice. Diabetic (C57BLKS-Leprdb/db) and non-diabetic (C57BLKS-Leprdb/+) mice were fed either HPD (60 kcal% protein) or control diet (22 kcal% protein), from 7 to 22 weeks of age. In db/db mice, HPD was found to significantly increase all measured readouts of renal injury including albuminuria, renal hypertrophy, mesangial expansion and expression of a panel of DN related markers, including KIM-1, Ki67 and Collagen III, which increased on both gene and protein levels. Furthermore, HPD activated the Renin-angiotensin system significantly and increased hyperfiltration, measured as reduced plasma Cystatin C. Usefulness of the HPD db/db mouse as a model for faster drug efficacy studies was investigated in a 5-week treatment study with the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin. Expectedly, dapagliflozin normalised blood glucose levels and improved glucose intolerance in both HPD and control diet mice. Only HPD db/db mice, not the control diet db/db mice, showed clear hyperfiltration that was significantly reduced with dapagliflozin treatment at both 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, these studies confirm that HPD can significantly accelerate progression of nephropathy in db/db mice, and that this model could be useful for rapid evaluation of drug targets with potential to ameliorate features of DN, especially glomerular hyperfiltration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is fundamental for many cellular processes, yet it is often dysregulated with aging. Increased amino acid (AA) availability is correlated with the expression of AA transporters (AAT) and mTORC1 activity. Although many AA sensors and mediators have been proposed to relay the AA signal to mTORC1, it has not yet been determined if chronic dietary intervention affects the expression of AAT, sensors and mediators and their relationships with mTORC1 activity. OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: This study investigated whether the consumption of a diet containing either the current recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein intake (0.8 g/kg/d) or twice the RDA (2RDA) for ten weeks affected the expression of targets associated with AA transport, sensing and mTORC1 regulation in 26 older men (70-81 years). METHOD: Muscle biopsies were collected before and after the intervention under fasting conditions. Diets were controlled by providing fully prepared meals and snacks. Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to measure protein and gene expression respectively. RESULTS: Consumption of 2RDA reduced the protein expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). However, plasma leucine concentration and basal mTORC1 activity were unaltered. The downregulation of LAT1 did not affect the expression of AA sensors and mediators, including leucyl tRNA synthetase (LRS), cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 (CASTOR1), Sestrin2 and Rag proteins. Instead, total ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) was upregulated with 2RDA. CONCLUSION: Ten weeks of 2RDA diet did not affect the fasting mTORC1 signaling, but increased total RPS6 might suggest improved muscular translational capacity to maintain muscular mass.",

      "abstract": "Arsenic toxicity purportedly threats a broad spectrum of female reproductive functions. We investigated the remedial role of a casein- and pea protein-enriched high-protein diet (HPD) in combating the arsenic insult. Cyclic female rats maintained on standard diet (n = 6) or an isocaloric HPD (n = 6) were gavaged with As2O3 at 3 mg/kg BW/rat/day (n = 12) for 28 days. Vehicle-fed rats (n = 6) maintained on the standard diet served as the control. We monitored the estrus cycles and performed the histomorphometric analyses of the uterus and ovary. Uterine luminal epithelial (ULE) ultrastructure was appraised by scanning electron microscopy. Uterine oxidative stress was evaluated in the forms of ROS generation and activities of the ROS scavengers. The uterine apoptotic manifestation was blueprinted by Western blot analysis of caspase-3 and Bax expression. Arsenic treatment arrested the follicular maturation and disrupted the estrus cycles with a typical increase in the diestrus index. Shrunken endometrial glands and thinned microvilli density of the ULE reflected loss of cell polarity and mislaid uterine homeostasis. Increased ROS generation and attenuated activities of the ROS scavengers marked a state of uterine oxidative imbalance and loss of redox regulation. Superfluous expression of procaspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax mirrored an inflated state of uterine apoptosis. HPD supplementation, by and large, counteracted these arsenic impacts and maintained the frameworks close to the control levels. In conclusion, arsenic mediates its reproductive toxicity, at least in part, by upsetting the uterine ROS homeostasis and redox regulation. Pea proteins and casein-supplemented HPD can counteract the arsenic effects and maintain the reproductive functions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive hepatic fat is associated with increased metabolic risk factors, production of inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress. High protein intake might trigger an increased hepatic lipid oxidation through an increase in hepatic energy expenditure. Furthermore, the majority of randomized controlled trials (RCT) in humans have failed to show whether carotenoids can be used to prevent and treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, it is notable and contradictory that NAFLD is rapidly escalating in Iran and other countries with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables (as sources of β-cryptoxanthin [β-CX] and carbohydrates) and higher intake of carbohydrates (as an agent of NAFLD); and the effects of β-CX and a high protein diet (HPD) on NAFLD need to be investigated further. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for 12 weeks to receive daily β-CX 6 mg supplementation combined with a HPD on levels of metabolic factors, β-CX, glycemic and lipid profiles, inflammatory factors, adipocytokines, and body composition. Ninety-two eligible patients, aged 18-60 years, of both genders, who are obese and overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25-40 kg/m2) will be randomly assigned to four groups as follow: HPD + placebo; normal protein diet + β-CX (NPD + β-CX); HPD + β-CX; and NPD + placebo (control group). Two populations will be analyzed in this work. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population includes all patients who will be randomized, while the per-protocol (PP) population includes all individuals who complete the 12- week intervention (i.e. study completers). DISCUSSION: Our findings from this trial will contribute to the knowledge of the relationship between β-CX supplementation and a HPD on NAFLD patients and determination of optimal macronutrient ratios without energy restriction.

However, there is little evidence among postpartum women. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a high protein diet on weight loss among postpartum women. A parallel-randomized controlled trial with 94 postpartum women was conducted in a maternity ward in Mesquita county (recruitment from February 2009 to December 2010) and in a polyclinic in Rio de Janeiro city (recruitment from December 2010 to December 2011). Women were randomized to the intervention group (IG) or control group (CG), and both groups received an isocaloric diet (1,800 kcal). Additionally, the IG received approximately 25 g of protein obtained from 125 g per week of sardine to increase daily dietary protein content and was advised to restrict carbohydrate intake. The CG received nutritional counselling to follow the national nutrition guidelines (15% protein, 60% carbohydrates, and 25% lipids). A linear mixed-effects model was used to test the effect of high protein intake and macronutrient intake on weight loss during the postpartum period. Body weight decreased in the IG compared with the CG (ß = -0.325; p = 0.049) among overweight and obese postpartum women. The percentage of energy intake from lipid (ß = -0.023; p = 0.050) was negatively associated with body weight, and carbohydrate intake (ß = 0.020; p = 0.026) was positively associated with body weight over time among all women. Protein intake and lower carbohydrate intake may be used as a dietary strategy to improve body weight loss during the postpartum period.",

      "abstract": "Glycogen disease type III (GSDIII), a rare incurable autosomal recessive disorder due to glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency, presents with liver, heart and skeletal muscle impairment, hepatomegaly and ketotic hypoglycemia. Muscle weakness usually worsens to fixed myopathy and cardiac involvement may present in about half of the patients during disease. Management relies on careful follow-up of symptoms and diet. No common agreement was reached on sugar restriction and treatment in adulthood. We administered two dietary regimens differing in their protein and carbohydrate content, high-protein (HPD) and high-protein/glucose-free (GFD), to our mouse model of GSDIII, starting at one month of age. Mice were monitored, either by histological, biochemical and molecular analysis and motor functional tests, until 10 months of age. GFD ameliorated muscle performance up to 10 months of age, while HPD showed little improvement only in young mice. In GFD mice, a decreased muscle glycogen content and fiber vacuolization was observed, even in aged animals indicating a protective role of proteins against skeletal muscle degeneration, at least in some districts. Hepatomegaly was reduced by about 20%. Moreover, the long-term administration of GFD did not worsen serum parameters even after eight months of high-protein diet. A decreased phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activities and an increased expression of Krebs cycle and gluconeogenesis genes were seen in the liver of GFD fed mice. Our data show that the concurrent use of proteins and a strictly controlled glucose supply could reduce muscle wasting, and indicate a better metabolic control in mice with a glucose-free/high-protein diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumption of added sugars has been considered a worldwide public health concern by its association with metabolic syndrome and its comorbidities. Meanwhile, current studies have suggested high-protein diets to promote weight loss and improved metabolic outcomes. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of long-term high-protein diet (HPD, 34.3% protein) intake on high-sucrose-fed rats. METHODS: Weaned male Wistar rats were randomized into two groups: rats fed a standard chow (CT/CT, 10% sucrose) or rats fed a high-sucrose diet (HSD, 25% sucrose) for a 20-week observational period. Subsequently, HS/HS animals were randomized into 3 new groups: rats maintained on HSD diet (HS/HS); rats submitted to HSD replacement by standard chow (HS/CT); and those with HSD replaced by HPD (HS/HP). All groups were followed up for 12 weeks during which we investigated the effects of HPD on body weight, energy intake, obesity development, glicemic/lipid profile, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, tissue weight (adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscles), lipolytic activity, liver lipoperoxidation and histology, as well as serum markers of hepatic function. RESULTS: Post-weaning exposure to HSD led to metabolic syndrome phenotype at adulthood, herein characterized by central obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance. Only HPD feeding was able to revert weight gain and adipose tissue accumulation, as well as restore adipose tissue lipolytic response to sympathetic stimulus. On the other hand, either HPD or withdrawal from HSD promoted very similar metabolic outcomes upon 12-week nutritional intervention. HS/HP and HS/CT rats showed reduced fasting serum levels of glucose, triacylglycerol and total cholesterol, which were correlated with the improvement of peripheral insulin sensitivity, as inferred from kITT and TyG Index values. Both nutritional interventions restored liver morphofunctional patterns, but only HPD restored lipid peroxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that 12-week intake of an isocaloric moderately high-protein diet consistently restored high-sucrose-induced central adiposity and obesity in addition to the attenuation of other important metabolic outcomes, such as improvement of glucolipid homeostasis associated to increased insulin sensitivity and reversal of hepatic steatosis. On the other hand, simple withdrawal from high-sucrose consumption also promoted the abovementioned metabolic outcomes with no impact on body weight."

The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of early high-protein diet on neurofunctional recovery in rats with ischemic stroke as well as their cerebral infarct areas and molecular expressions of oxidative stress. MATERIAL AND METHODS The middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) was established, and 48 adult, male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats of clean grade aged seven to eight months (250-280 g body weight) were randomized into four groups: the MCAO group with high-protein diet (MH), the MCAO group with standard-protein diet (MS), the sham group with high-protein diet (SH), and the sham group with standard-protein diet (SS). High-protein diet intervention started on the first day of the surgery, and the rats' body weights and their neurological deficit scores were measured on each postoperative day while the scores of motors coordination and balance ability were recorded every other day. In addition, their cerebral infant areas and the molecular expressions of oxidative stress injuries were detected as well. RESULTS Compared to the MS group, the rats in the MH group gained faster weight growth (p<0.05), presented significantly lower neurological impairment scores (p<0.05), remarkably improved motor coordination and balance ability (p<0.05) as well as showed smaller cerebral infarct areas (p<0.05), increased expression of SOD (superoxide dismutase), and reduced expressions of MDA (malondialdehyde) and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase). However, there was no significant difference between the SS group and the SH group (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Early high-protein diet facilitates the recovery of body weights and neurological functions as well the reduction of the cerebral infarct areas of rats, thus alleviating ischemic stroke-caused oxidative stress injuries.",

      "abstract": "This study compares the effects of an 8-wk isocaloric high-protein (HP) diet versus a combination exercise (Comb-Ex) regimen on paralytic vastus lateralis (VL) and nonparalytic deltoid muscle in individuals with long-standing spinal cord injury (SCI). Fiber-type distribution, cross-sectional area (CSA), levels of translation initiation signaling proteins (Erk-1/2, Akt, p70S6K1, 4EBP1, RPS6, and FAK), and lean thigh mass were analyzed at baseline and after the 8-wk interventions. A total of 11 participants (C5-T12 levels, 21.8 ± 6.3 yr postinjury; 6 Comb-Ex and 5 HP diet) completed the study. Comb-Ex training occurred 3 days/wk and consisted of upper body resistance training (RT) in addition to neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)-induced-RT for paralytic VL muscle. Strength training was combined with high-intensity arm-cranking exercises (1-min intervals at 85-90%, V̇o2peak) for improving cardiovascular endurance. For the HP diet intervention, protein and fat each comprised 30%, and carbohydrate comprised 40% of total energy. Clinical tests and muscle biopsies were performed 24 h before and after the last exercise or diet session. The Comb-Ex intervention increased Type IIa myofiber distribution and CSA in VL muscle and Type I and IIa myofiber CSA in deltoid muscle. In addition, Comb-Ex increased lean thigh mass, V̇o2peak, and upper body strength ( P < 0.05). These results suggest that exercise training is required to promote favorable changes in paralytic and nonparalytic muscles in individuals with long-standing SCI, and adequate dietary protein consumption alone may not be sufficient to ameliorate debilitating effects of paralysis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first to directly compare the effects of an isocaloric high-protein diet and combination exercise training on clinical and molecular changes in paralytic and nonparalytic muscles of individuals with long-standing spinal cord injury. Our results demonstrated that muscle growth and fiber-type alterations can best be achieved when the paralyzed muscle is sufficiently loaded via neuromuscular electrical stimulation-induced resistance training.",

      "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a major etiology of cancer. Accumulating epidemiological and experimental evidences suggest that intake of high protein diet (HPD) is associated with colitis-associated colon cancer, however, most of the studies were confined in colon. Systemic influence of HPD on inflammation indices in different tissues of an organism has never been studied. We therefore investigated the effect of HPD on mouse skin and colonic inflammation using the well characterized inflammation induction protocol in both tissues (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [TPA] for skin and dextran sodium sulfate [DSS] for colon). ICR mice were grouped to normal diet (ND, 20% casein) or HPD (50% casein) groups. In each diet group, mice were treated with either vehicle (acetone or H2O), TPA, TPA and DSS, or DSS. Experimental diet was fed for total 4 weeks. After 1 week of diet feeding, 6.5 nmol of TPA was topically applied twice a week for 2 weeks on the shaved mouse dorsal skin. Drinking water containing 2% DSS was administered for 7 days at the final week of experiment. The results showed that TPA-induced skin hyperplasia, epidermal cell proliferation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression were reduced in HPD group compared to ND group. In contrast, HPD increased DSS-induced colon mucosal hyperplasia, colonocyte proliferation, COX-2 expression, and plasma nitric oxide compared to ND group. This suggests that HPD exerts differential effect on different tissue inflammation which implies efficacy of protein intervention to human also should be monitored more thoroughly."

      "abstract": "Acute illness and hospitalization in elderly individuals are often accompanied by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and malnutrition, both associated with wasting and mortality. Nutritional support and resistance training were shown to increase muscle anabolism and reduce inflammation in healthy elderly. We hypothesized that nutritional support and resistance training would accelerate the resolution of inflammation in hospitalized elderly patients with SIRS. Acutely admitted patients aged >65 years with SIRS were randomized to an intervention consisting of a high-protein diet (1.7 g/kg per day) during hospitalization, and daily protein supplement (18.8 g) and 3 weekly resistance training sessions for 12 weeks after discharge (Intervention, n=14), or to standard-care (Control, n=15). Plasma levels of the inflammatory biomarkers soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), interleukin-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and albumin were measured at admission, discharge, and 4 and 13 weeks after discharge. The Intervention group had an earlier decrease in suPAR levels than the Control group: -15.4% vs. +14.5%, P=.007 during hospitalization, and -2.4% vs. -28.6%, P=.007 between discharge and 4 weeks. There were no significant effects of the intervention on the other biomarkers. All biomarkers improved significantly between admission and 13 weeks, although with different kinetics (suPAR: -22%, interleukin-6: -86%, CRP: -89%, albumin: +11%). Nutritional support during hospitalization was associated with an accelerated decrease in suPAR levels, whereas the combined nutrition and resistance training intervention after discharge did not appear to affect the inflammatory state. Our results indicate that improved nutritional care during hospitalization may accelerate recovery in acutely ill elderly medical patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Xiao'er Qixingcha (EXQ) has been extensively applied to relieve dyspepsia and constipation in children for hundreds of years in China. However, the therapeutic mechanism underlying its efficacy remained to be defined. The present study aimed to clarify the possible laxative and immune-regulating effects of EXQ on two models of experimental constipation in mice, which mimicked the pediatric constipation caused by high-heat and high-protein diet (HHPD). METHODS: The two models of constipated mice were induced by HHPD or HHPD + atropine respectively. To investigate the laxative and immune-regulating activities of EXQ, animals were treated with three doses of EXQ (0.75, 1.5 and 3 g/kg) for 7 consecutive days. The fecal output parameters (number and weight), weight of intestinal content and, the thymus and spleen indexes were measured. The levels of sIgA, IL-10, TNF-α and LPS in colon and serum were determined by ELISA. Furthermore, the pathological changes of colon tissue were examined after routine H&E staining. RESULTS: Both HHPD and HHPD + atropine treatments obviously inhibited the fecal output and reduced the colonic sIgA, prominently increased the levels of IL-10 and TNF-α in colonic tissue and elevated the contents of LPS in serum and colonic tissues. In contrast, oral administration of EXQ significantly improved the feces characters and dose-dependently decreased the intestinal changes in both models. In HHPD model test, EXQ efficaciously boosted the sIgA level in a dose-dependent manner, significantly elicited decreases in TNF-α and IL-10 levels, and evidently decreased the spleen and thymus indexes. In HHPD + atropine model test, EXQ treatment reversed the pathological changes by not only dramatically decreasing the spleen index and the levels of LPS and IL-10, but also markedly elevating the thymus index. Furthermore, microscopic observation revealed that EXQ treatment maintained the integrity of colonic mucosa, and protected the colonic tissues from inflammation in the both models. CONCLUSIONS: EXQ exhibited prominent laxative activity and effectively protected the colonic mucosal barrier in two models of constipated mice, of which the mechanism might be closely associated with its propulsive and immune-regulating properties. The current results not only validated the rationale for the clinical application of EXQ in pediatric constipation related symptoms, but also threw new light on the immune-inflammatory responses accompanied with chronic constipation pathology.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intentional weight loss in obese older adults is a risk factor for accelerated muscle mass loss. We investigated whether a high protein diet and/or resistance exercise preserves fat free mass (FFM) during weight loss in overweight and obese older adults. METHODS: We included 100 overweight and obese adults (55-80 year) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 2 × 2 factorial design and intention-to-treat analysis. During a 10-week weight loss program all subjects followed a hypocaloric diet. Subjects were randomly allocated to either a high protein (1.3 g/kg body weight) or normal protein diet (0.8 g/kg), with or without a resistance exercise program 3 times/week. FFM was assessed by air displacement plethysmography. RESULTS: At baseline, mean (±SD) BMI was 32 ± 4 kg/m2. During intervention, protein intake was 1.13 ± 0.35 g/kg in the high protein groups vs. 0.98 ± 0.29 in the normal protein groups, which reflects a 16.3 ± 5.2 g/d higher protein intake in the high protein groups. Both high protein diet and exercise did not significantly affect change in body weight, FFM and fat mass (FM). No significant protein*exercise interaction effect was observed for FFM. However, within-group analysis showed that high protein in combination with exercise significantly increased FFM (+0.6 ± 1.3 kg, p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: A high protein diet, though lower than targeted, did not significantly affect changes in FFM during modest weight loss in older overweight and obese adults. There was no significant interaction between the high protein diet and resistance exercise for change in FFM. However, only the group with the combined intervention of high protein diet and resistance exercise significantly increased in FFM.

      "abstract": "The impact of the dietary protein level on the process of colonic mucosal inflammation and subsequent recovery remains largely unknown. In this study, we fed DSS-treated mice with either a normoproteic (NP) or a high-protein (HP) isocaloric diet from the beginning of the 5-day dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment to 14 days later. Measurements of colitis indicators (colon weight:length ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine expressions) showed a similar level of colonic inflammation in both DSS groups during the colitis induction phase. However, during the colitis resolution phase, inflammation intensity was higher in the DSS-HP group than in the DSS-NP group as evidenced by higher inflammatory score and body weight loss. This coincided with a higher mortality rate. In surviving animals, an increase in colonic crypt height associated with a higher number of colon epithelial cells per crypt, and TGF-β3 content was observed in the DSS-HP vs. DSS-NP group. Moreover, colonic expression patterns of tight junction proteins and E-cadherin were also different according to the diet. Altogether, our results indicate that the HP diet, when given during both the induction and resolution periods of DSS-induced colitis, showed deleterious effects during the post-induction phase. However, HP diet ingestion was also associated with morphological and biochemical differences compatible with higher colonic epithelium restoration in surviving animals, indicating an effect of the dietary protein level on colonic crypt repair after acute inflammation. These data highlight the potential impact of the dietary protein amount during the colitis course.",

Current standard treatment focuses on lifestyle interventions. The primary aim of this study was to assess the effects of a short-term low-calorie diet on hepatic steatosis, using the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) as quantitative tool. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 60 patients with hepatic steatosis were monitored during a hypocaloric high-fiber, high-protein diet containing 1,000 kcal/day. At baseline and after 14 days, we measured hepatic fat contents using CAP during transient elastography, body composition with bioelectrical impedance analysis, and serum liver function tests and lipid profiles using standard clinical-chemical assays. RESULTS: The median age was 56 years (25-78 years); 51.7% were women and median body mass index was 31.9 kg/m(2) (22.4-44.8 kg/m(2)). After 14 days, a significant CAP reduction (14.0%; P<0.001) was observed from 295 dB/m (216-400 dB/m) to 266 dB/m (100-353 dB/m). In parallel, body weight decreased by 4.6% (P<0.001), of which 61.9% was body fat. In addition, liver stiffness (P=0.002), γ-GT activities, and serum lipid concentrations decreased (all P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time that non-invasive elastography can be used to monitor rapid effects of dietary treatment for hepatic steatosis. CAP improvements occur after only 14 days on short-term low-calorie diet, together with reductions of body composition parameters, serum lipids, and liver enzymes, pointing to the dynamics of hepatic lipid turnover."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Eight weeks of a high protein diet (>3 g/kg/day) coupled with a periodized heavy resistance training program has been shown to positively affect body composition with no deleterious effects on health. Using a randomized, crossover design, resistance-trained male subjects underwent a 16-week intervention (i.e., two 8-week periods) in which they consumed either their normal (i.e., habitual) or a higher protein diet (>3 g/kg/day). Thus, the purpose of this study was to ascertain if significantly increasing protein intake would affect clinical markers of health (i.e., lipids, kidney function, etc.) as well as performance and body composition in young males with extensive resistance training experience. METHODS: Twelve healthy resistance-trained men volunteered for this study (mean ± SD: age 25.9 ± 3.7 years; height 178.0 ± 8.5 cm; years of resistance training experience 7.6 ± 3.6) with 11 subjects completing most of the assessments. In a randomized crossover trial, subjects were tested at baseline and after two 8-week treatment periods (i.e., habitual [normal] diet and high protein diet) for body composition, measures of health (i.e., blood lipids, comprehensive metabolic panel) and performance. Each subject maintained a food diary for the 16-week treatment period (i.e., 8 weeks on their normal or habitual diet and 8 weeks on a high protein diet). Each subject provided a food diary of two weekdays and one weekend day per week. In addition, subjects kept a diary of their training regimen that was used to calculate total work performed. RESULTS: During the normal and high protein phase of the treatment period, subjects consumed 2.6 ± 0.8 and 3.3 ± 0.8 g/kg/day of dietary protein, respectively. The mean protein intake over the 4-month period was 2.9 ± 0.9 g/kg/day. The high protein group consumed significantly more calories and protein (p < 0.05) than the normal protein group. There were no differences in dietary intake between the groups for any other measure. Moreover, there were no significant changes in body composition or markers of health in either group. There were no side effects (i.e., blood lipids, glucose, renal, kidney function etc.) regarding high protein consumption. CONCLUSION: In resistance-trained young men who do not significantly alter their training regimen, consuming a high protein diet (2.6 to 3.3 g/kg/day) over a 4-month period has no effect on blood lipids or markers of renal and hepatic function. Nor were there any changes in performance or body composition. This is the first crossover trial using resistance-trained subjects in which the elevation of protein intake to over four times the recommended dietary allowance has shown no harmful effects.",

Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to determine if a high protein diet in conjunction with a periodized heavy resistance training program would affect indices of body composition, performance and health. METHODS: Forty-eight healthy resistance-trained men and women completed this study (mean ± SD; Normal Protein group [NP n = 17, four female and 13 male]: 24.8 ± 6.9 yr; 174.0 ± 9.5 cm height; 74.7 ± 9.6 kg body weight; 2.4 ± 1.7 yr of training; High Protein group [HP n = 31, seven female and 24 male]: 22.9 ± 3.1 yr; 172.3 ± 7.7 cm; 74.3 ± 12.4 kg; 4.9 ± 4.1 yr of training). Moreover, all subjects participated in a split-routine, periodized heavy resistance-training program. Training and daily diet logs were kept by each subject. Subjects in the NP and HP groups were instructed to consume their baseline (~2 g/kg/d) and >3 g/kg/d of dietary protein, respectively. RESULTS: Subjects in the NP and HP groups consumed 2.3 and 3.4 g/kg/day of dietary protein during the treatment period. The NP group consumed significantly (p < 0.05) more protein during the treatment period compared to their baseline intake. The HP group consumed more (p < 0.05) total energy and protein during the treatment period compared to their baseline intake. Furthermore, the HP group consumed significantly more (p < 0.05) total calories and protein compared to the NP group. There were significant time by group (p ≤ 0.05) changes in body weight (change: +1.3 ± 1.3 kg NP, -0.1 ± 2.5 HP), fat mass (change: -0.3 ± 2.2 kg NP, -1.7 ± 2.3 HP), and % body fat (change: -0.7 ± 2.8 NP, -2.4 ± 2.9 HP). The NP group gained significantly more body weight than the HP group; however, the HP group experienced a greater decrease in fat mass and % body fat. There was a significant time effect for FFM; however, there was a non-significant time by group effect for FFM (change: +1.5 ± 1.8 NP, +1.5 ± 2.2 HP). Furthermore, a significant time effect (p ≤ 0.05) was seen in both groups vis a vis improvements in maximal strength (i.e., 1-RM squat and bench) vertical jump and pull-ups; however, there were no significant time by group effects (p ≥ 0.05) for all exercise performance measures. Additionally, there were no changes in any of the blood parameters (i.e., basic metabolic panel). CONCLUSION: Consuming a high protein diet (3.4 g/kg/d) in conjunction with a heavy resistance-training program may confer benefits with regards to body composition. Furthermore, there is no evidence that consuming a high protein diet has any deleterious effects.",

A positive net protein balance may support fat free mass accrual. However, few data are available on the impact of more prolonged changes in habitual protein intake on whole-body protein metabolism and basal muscle protein synthesis rates. OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in whole-body protein turnover and basal muscle protein synthesis rates following 12 weeks of adaptation to a low versus high dietary protein intake. METHODS: A randomized parallel study was performed in 40 subjects who followed either a high protein (2.4 g protein/kg/d) or low protein (0.4 g protein/kg/d) energy-balanced diet (30/35/35% or 5/60/35% energy from protein/carbohydrate/fat) for a period of 12 weeks. A subgroup of 7 men and 8 women (body mass index: 22.8±2.3 kg/m2, age: 24.3±4.9 y) were selected to evaluate the impact of prolonged adaptation to either a high or low protein intake on whole body protein metabolism and basal muscle protein synthesis rates. After the diet, subjects received continuous infusions with L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine and L-[ring-2H2]tyrosine in an overnight fasted state, with blood samples and muscle biopsies being collected to assess post-absorptive whole-body protein turnover and muscle protein synthesis rates in vivo in humans. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of intervention, whole-body protein balance in the fasted state was more negative in the high protein treatment when compared with the low protein treatment (-4.1±0.5 vs -2.7±0.6 μmol phenylalanine/kg/h;P<0.001). Whole-body protein breakdown (43.0±4.4 vs 37.8±3.8 μmol phenylalanine/kg/h;P<0.03), synthesis (38.9±4.2 vs 35.1±3.6 μmol phenylalanine/kg/h;P<0.01) and phenylalanine hydroxylation rates (4.1±0.6 vs 2.7±0.6 μmol phenylalanine/kg/h;P<0.001) were significantly higher in the high vs low protein group. Basal muscle protein synthesis rates were maintained on a low vs high protein diet (0.042±0.01 vs 0.045±0.01%/h;P = 0.620). CONCLUSIONS: In the overnight fasted state, adaptation to a low-protein intake (0.4 g/kg/d) does not result in a more negative whole-body protein balance and does not lower basal muscle protein synthesis rates when compared to a high-protein intake.

In this study, we analyzed short-term and sustainable effects of a prenatal versus early postnatal maternal high-protein diet on growth and hepatic gene expression in mouse offspring. METHODS: Dams were exposed to an isoenergetic high-protein (HP, 40 % w/w) diet during pregnancy or lactation. Growth and hepatic expression profiles of male offspring were evaluated directly after weaning and 150 days after birth. Offspring from two dietary groups, high-protein diet during pregnancy and control diet during lactation (HPC), and control diet during pregnancy and high-protein diet during lactation (CHP), were compared with offspring (CC) from control-fed dams. RESULTS: Maternal CHP treatment was associated with sustained offspring growth retardation, but decreased numbers of affected hepatic genes in adults compared to weanlings. In contrast, offspring of the HPC group did not show persistent effects on growth parameters, but the number of affected hepatic genes was even increased at adult age. In both dietary groups, however, only a small subset of genes was affected in weanlings as well as in adults. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) prenatal and early postnatal maternal HP diet caused persistent, but (2) different effects and partially complementary trends on growth characteristics and on the hepatic transcriptome and associated pathways and that (3) only a small number of genes and associated upstream regulators might be involved in passing early diet-induced imprints to adulthood.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a three-week low-calorie diet with and without supplementation on body composition. METHODS: Thirty-seven recreationally-trained women (n = 37; age = 27.1 ± 4.2; height = 165.1 ± 6.4; weight = 68.5 ± 10.1; BMI = 25.1 ± 3.4) completed one of the following three-week interventions: no change in diet (CON); a high-protein, low-calorie diet supplemented with a thermogenic, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a protein gel, and a multi-vitamin (SUP); or the high-protein diet with isocaloric placebo supplements (PLA). Before and after the three-week intervention, body weight, %Fat via dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), segmental fat mass via DXA, %Fat via skinfolds, and skinfold thicknesses at seven sites were measured. RESULTS: SUP and PLA significantly decreased body weight (SUP: PRE, 70.47 ± 8.01 kg to POST, 67.51 ± 8.10 kg; PLA: PRE, 67.88 ± 12.28 kg vs. POST, 66.38 ± 11.94 kg; p ≤ 0.05) with a greater (p ≤ 0.05) decrease in SUP than PLA or CON. SUP and PLA significantly decreased %Fat according to DXA (SUP: PRE, 34.98 ± 7.05% to POST, 32.99 ± 6.89%; PLA: PRE, 34.22 ± 6.36% vs. POST, 32.69 ± 5.84%; p ≤ 0.05), whereas only SUP significantly decreased %Fat according to skinfolds (SUP: PRE, 27.40 ± 4.09% to POST, 24.08 ± 4.31%; p ≤ 0.05). SUP significantly (p ≤ 0.05) decreased thicknesses at five skinfolds (chest, waist, hip, subscapular, and tricep) compared to PLA, but not at two skinfolds (axilla and thigh). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a thermogenic, CLA, protein, and a multi-vitamin to a three-week low-calorie diet improved weight loss, total fat loss and subcutaneous fat loss, compared to diet alone.",

      "abstract": "Dietary factors continue to preside as dominant influences in prostate cancer prevalence and progression-free survival following primary treatment. We investigated the influence of a low carbohydrate diet, compared to a typical Western diet, on prostate cancer (PCa) tumor growth in vivo. LNCaP xenograft tumor growth was studied in both intact and castrated mice, representing a more advanced castration resistant PCa (CRPC). No differences in LNCaP tumor progression (total tumor volume) with diet was observed for intact mice (P = 0.471) however, castrated mice on the Low Carb diet saw a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth rate compared with Western diet fed mice (P = 0.017). No correlation with serum PSA was observed. Steroid profiles, alongside serum cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels, were significantly altered by both diet and castration. Specifically, DHT concentration with the Low Carb diet was 58% that of the CRPC-bearing mice on the Western diet. Enzymes in the steroidogenesis pathway were directly impacted and tumors isolated from intact mice on the Low Carb diet had higher AKR1C3 protein levels and lower HSD17B2 protein levels than intact mice on the Western diet (ARK1C3: P = 0.074; HSD17B2: P = 0.091, with α = 0.1). In contrast, CRPC tumors from mice on Low Carb diets had higher concentrations of both HSD17B2 (P = 0.016) and SRD5A1 (P = 0.058 with α = 0.1) enzymes. There was no correlation between tumor growth in castrated mice for Low Carb diet versus Western diet and (a) serum insulin (b) GH serum levels (c) insulin receptor (IR) or (d) IGF-1R in tumor tissue. Intact mice fed Western diet had higher serum insulin which was associated with significantly higher blood glucose and tumor tissue IR. We conclude that both diet and castration have a significant impact on the endocrinology of mice bearing LNCaP xenograft tumors. The observed effects of diet on cholesterol and steroid regulation impact tumor tissue DHT specifically and are likely to be mechanistic drivers behind the observed tumor growth suppression.",

      "abstract": "A high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet has been regarded as a dietary intervention for weight loss in the obese population. We integrated metabolomics profiles and correlation-based network analysis to reveal the difference in metabolism under diets with different protein:carbohydrate ratios. Rats were fed a control diet (moderate-protein moderate-carbohydrate: MPMC; 20 % protein, 56 % carbohydrate) or HPLC diet (high-protein low-carbohydrate: 45 % protein, 30 % carbohydrate) for 6 weeks. The fat content was equal for both diets. HPLC feeding induced weight loss and reduced adipose weight and plasma triglyceride. Compared to the MPMC diet, HPLC significantly increased plasma α-tocopherol, pyruvate, 2-oxoisocaproate, and β-hydroxybutyrate, and reduced linoleate, palmitate, α-glycerophosphate and pyroglutamic acid. The HPLC-associated urinary metabolite profile was signified with an increase in palmitate and stearate and a reduction of citrate, 2-ketoglutarate, malate, and pantothenate. Pathway analysis implicated a significant alteration of the TCA cycle in urine. Biomarker screening demonstrated that individual metabolites, including plasma urea, pyruvate, and urinary citrate, robustly distinguished the HPLC group from the MPMC group. Correlation-based network analysis enabled to demonstrate that the correlation of plasma metabolite was strengthened after the HPLC diet, while the energy-metabolism relatives 2-ketoglutarate and fumarate correlated positively with phenylalanine, methionine, and serine. The correlation network between plasma-urinary metabolites revealed a negative correlation of plasma valine with urinary β-hydroxybutyrate in MPMC rats. In HPLC rats, plasma 2-oxoisocaproate negatively correlated with urinary pyruvate and glycine. This study using metabolomics analysis revealed the systemic metabolism in response to diet treatment and identified the significantly distinct profiles associated with a HPLC diet.",

We measured blood protein and albumin concentrations, lipid profiles, white blood cell (WBC) counts, proinflammatory cytokine production, and splenocyte proliferation in rats that had been treated with a 17.5 Gy dose of radiation 30 days prior. A high-protein diet affected plasma total cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, which were increased by the radiation treatment. In addition, the lymphocyte percentage and immunoglobulin M (IgM) concentration were increased, and the neutrophil percentage was decreased in rats fed a high-protein diet. Resveratrol supplementation decreased the triglyceride (TG) level, but increased the IgM concentration and splenocyte proliferation. Proinflammatory cytokine production was lower in rats fed a high-protein diet supplemented with resveratrol than in rats fed a control diet. The results of the present study indicate that high-protein diets, with or without resveratrol supplementation, might assist with recovery from radiation-induced inflammation by modulating immune cell percentages and cytokine production."

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a HP diet on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in hyperlipidaemic mice. Hyperlipidaemic male and female APOE2 knock-in (APOE2ki) mice were fed a semi-synthetic low-protein (LP) or HP diet in combination with a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet for 3 weeks. The HP diets reduced hepatic fat and cholesterol concentrations to 40-55 % of those induced by the corresponding LP diets and attenuated hepatic inflammation mildly. The VLDL-associated plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased to 60-80 %, but those of TAG increased 3-4-fold. APOE2-mediated restriction of fat import into the liver did not modify the effects of a HP diet previously observed in wild-type mice. Female APOE2ki mice exhibited a higher expression of lipogenic, cholesterol-synthesising, inflammatory and cell-stress genes than wild-type female or male APOE2ki mice, but a similar response to HP diets. Low Apob expression and unchanged plasma APOB100 concentrations suggest that HP diets increase the plasma concentrations of TAG by slowing their clearance. The decrease in plasma leptin and hepatic fat and glycogen concentrations and the increase in fatty acid-oxidising gene and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 protein expression suggest a HP diet-mediated increase in mitochondrial metabolism. In conclusion, a HP diet reduces hepatic lipid content in dyslipidaemic mice and lowers the activation status of inflammatory cells in the liver.",

Based on our previous study, the period of 10 days after ART was used as an acute inflammation model. Rats were exposed to a radiation dose of 17.5 Gy and were supplied with a control (C), 30% high-protein diet (HP), resveratrol supplementation (RES), or HP with RES diet ([HP+RES]). At day 10 after ART, we measured profiles of lipids, proteins, and immune cells in blood. The levels of clusters of differentiating 4(+) (CD4(+)) cells and regulatory T cells, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in urine were also measured. ART caused significant disturbances of lipid profiles by increasing triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The proinflammatroy cytokine levels were also increased by ART. All the experimental diets (HP, RES, and [HP+RES]) significantly decreased levels of TG, monocytes, proinflammatory cytokines, and 8-OHdG, whereas the platelet counts were increased. In addition, the HP and [HP+RES] diets decreased the concentrations of plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Also, the HP and RES diets decreased regulatory T cells compared with those of the control diet in ART group. Further, the HP diet led to a significant recovery of white blood cell counts, as well as increased percentages of lymphocyte and decreased percentages of neutrophils. In summary, RES appeared to be significantly effective in minimizing radiation-induced damage to lipid metabolism and immune responses. Our study also demonstrated the importance of dietary protein intake in recovering from acute inflammation by radiation.",

It has been posited that intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day are needed for physically active individuals. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of a very high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/d) on body composition in resistance-trained men and women. METHODS: Thirty healthy resistance-trained individuals participated in this study (mean ± SD; age: 24.1 ± 5.6 yr; height: 171.4 ± 8.8 cm; weight: 73.3 ± 11.5 kg). Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Control (CON) or high protein (HP). The CON group was instructed to maintain the same training and dietary habits over the course of the 8 week study. The HP group was instructed to consume 4.4 grams of protein per kg body weight daily. They were also instructed to maintain the same training and dietary habits (e.g. maintain the same fat and carbohydrate intake). Body composition (Bod Pod®), training volume (i.e. volume load), and food intake were determined at baseline and over the 8 week treatment period. RESULTS: The HP group consumed significantly more protein and calories pre vs post (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the HP group consumed significantly more protein and calories than the CON (p < 0.05). The HP group consumed on average 307 ± 69 grams of protein compared to 138 ± 42 in the CON. When expressed per unit body weight, the HP group consumed 4.4 ± 0.8 g/kg/d of protein versus 1.8 ± 0.4 g/kg/d in the CON. There were no changes in training volume for either group. Moreover, there were no significant changes over time or between groups for body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, or percent body fat. CONCLUSIONS: Consuming 5.5 times the recommended daily allowance of protein has no effect on body composition in resistance-trained individuals who otherwise maintain the same training regimen. This is the first interventional study to demonstrate that consuming a hypercaloric high protein diet does not result in an increase in body fat."

We examined the effect of a high-protein diet on the maintenance of reduced BP after weight loss in 420 overweight adults from the Diet, Obesity and Genes study. After an 8-week weight-loss period (>8% BW), subjects (42±6 years) were randomized to either a high-protein diet (23-28 en% protein) or a lower-protein control diet (10-15 en% protein) for 26 weeks. BMI after weight loss was 30.3±4.3 kg m(-2), BP was 118/73 mm Hg and 28 subjects (6.5%) used antihypertensive agents. Systolic BP during 26 weeks of weight maintenance dietary intervention increased in both treatment groups, but it was 2.2 mm Hg less (95% CI: -4.6 to 0.2 mm Hg, P=0.08) in the high-protein group than in the lower-protein control group. In 191 (pre)hypertensive subjects (baseline systolic BP⩾120 mm Hg), a larger difference was observed (-4.2 mm Hg (-7.7, -0.7), P=0.02). The effect was attenuated after adjustment for initial BP (-3.4 mm Hg (-6.9, -0.03), P=0.048), and after additional adjustment for weight change (-2.7 mm Hg (-6.1, 0.4), P=0.11). Adjustment for 24-h urinary excretion of sodium and potassium did not change the results. Diastolic BP yielded similar results. These findings suggest that a BP reduction after weight loss is better maintained when the intake of protein is increased at the expense of carbohydrates. This effect is partly mediated by body weight.",

      "abstract": "Heart failure treatment guidelines provide no recommendations regarding the intake of protein, though it has been proposed that increasing protein intake may result in clinical improvement. High-protein intake might improve protein synthesis and cell function, and prevent deterioration in mitochondrial and left ventricular function. We assessed the effects of a high-protein diet on the development of heart failure characterized by cardiac hypertrophy, impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and contractile dysfunction induced by transverse aortic constriction in rats. A standard diet with 18% of energy intake from protein was compared with a high-protein diet (30% of energy intake). First, we evaluated the effects of protein intake on the development of heart failure during 14 weeks of aortic constriction, and found similar cardiac hypertrophy, contractile dysfunction, ventricular dilation, and decreased cardiac mitochondrial oxidative capacity with both 18% and 30% protein. We then assessed more advanced heart failure, with 22 weeks of aortic constriction. We again saw no difference in cardiac mass, left ventricular volume, mitochondrial oxidative capacity or resistance to permeability transition between the 18% and 30% protein diets. There was a modest but significant decrease in survival with heart failure with the 30% protein diet compared with 18% protein (p < 0.003). In conclusion, consumption of a high-protein diet did not affect cardiac mass, left ventricular volumes or ejection fraction, or myocardial mitochondrial oxidative capacity in rats with pressure overload induced heart failure, but significantly decreased survival.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Chyluria is an inappropriate urinary excretion of chyle that turns the urine milky. A nutritional approach based on low-fat/high-protein content diet associated or not with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) showed to be an efficient conservative treatment to improve the milky urine appearance in a patient with chyluria. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old female patient was admitted with chyluria of unknown etiology. An ureteropyeloscopy revealed a single lesion in each kidney, both with linear aspect and measuring 5 mm in extension. These lesions were located close to the renal papillae and were leaking a cloudy and milky fluid. Both lesions were laser cauterized followed by improvement of the milky urine. However, the chyluria relapsed after few months and a low-fat/high-protein content diet with 10 g of soybean oil to meet the requirements essential fatty acids (EFA) and with MCT from coconut oil as alternative to prepare foods was started. Few weeks later the patient returned reporting consistent improvement of the milky urine appearance related with the use of the diet. However since the diet was tasteless and time consuming to prepare, she reported low compliance to diet with MCT and the milky urine relapsed. The MCT was discontinued and the diet with EFA source was maintained with better compliance. Since then the chyluria remains in remission. In conclusion, the dramatic improvement of the milky urine with low-fat/high-protein diet with EFA source observed in our patient demonstrates that this nutritional approach is efficient with fast results to treat chyluria during long term.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is an increasing health problem. Because drug treatments are limited, diets remain popular. High-protein diets (HPD) reduce body weight (BW), although the mechanisms are unclear. We investigated physiological mechanisms altered by switching diet induced obesity (DIO) rats from Western-type diet (WTD) to HPD. Male rats were fed standard (SD) or WTD (45% calories from fat). After developing DIO (50% of rats), they were switched to SD (15% calories from protein) or HPD (52% calories from protein) for up to 4 weeks. Food intake (FI), BW, body composition, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and intestinal hormone plasma levels were monitored. Rats fed WTD showed an increased FI and had a 25% greater BW gain after 9 wk compared with SD (P < 0.05). Diet-induced obese rats switched from WTD to HPD reduced daily FI by 30% on day 1, which lasted to day 9 (-9%) and decreased BW during the 2-wk period compared with SD/SD (P < 0.05). During these 2 wk, WTD/HPD rats lost 72% more fat mass than WTD/SD (P < 0.05), whereas lean mass was unaltered. WTD/HPD rats had lower blood glucose than WTD/SD at 30 min postglucose gavage (P < 0.05). The increase of pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY during the 2-h dark-phase feeding was higher in WTD/HPD compared with WTD/SD (P < 0.05). These data indicate that HPD reduces BW in WTD rats, which may be related to decreased FI and the selective reduction of fat mass accompanied by improved glucose tolerance, suggesting relevant benefits of HPD in the treatment of obesity.",
