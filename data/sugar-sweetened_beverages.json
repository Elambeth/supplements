      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite continuing efforts to reduce teenagers' consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), intake remains high across the globe. Currently, we lack a holistic understanding that also includes the lived experiences of teenagers in today's online and offline environments regarding the role of SSB's. The aim of the present paper is therefore twofold: (1) to gain a holistic understanding of teenagers' perspectives, beliefs, barriers, contextual triggers and latent needs (that is, their lived experiences) in relation to SSB consumption; and (2) to explore their views about which intervention strategies would be most likely to reduce their SSB consumption. METHODS: A qualitative context-mapping approach, including prior sensitising assignments, was used to gain in-depth insights into the lived experiences with regard to SSB consumption of teenagers attending prevocational-level secondary school (VMBO) and living in low socioeconomic position neighbourhoods in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From March to April 2021, 48 teenagers, aged 12 to 16, took part in the study. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, data were collected partly online and partly in person. All data were coded and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified that appeared to influence the teenage SSB consumption: (1) social norms - drinking SSBs is normal; (2) attitudes and beliefs with regard to health versus enjoyment; (3) the easy availability and affordability of SSBs; and (4) intense industry marketing efforts. We additionally explored teenage views about changes most likely to reduce their SSB consumption and found that they would be receptive to population-level interventions such as taxation. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides comprehensive insights into teenagers' lived experiences in relation to SSBs. It highlights the prominent roles of strong social norms, conflicting beliefs, and the pervasive marketing, easy availability and low prices of SSBs. This underlines the need for a systems approach, applying combinations of effective, integrated strategies that can be specifically tailored to the perspectives of today's teenagers.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is recognized as a significant risk factor for chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Accurate estimates of the burden of SSBs are crucial for preventing, controlling, and treating associated diseases to achieve the Third United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of reducing premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. In this study, we aim to systematically assess the regional patterns and trends in the burden of SSBs in the North Africa and the Middle East (NAME) region. By analyzing regional differences, the study identifies specific areas where SSBs consumption has a more significant impact on public health. METHODS: The study data were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021. This study analyzed the impact of SSBs on mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 21 countries in the NAME region from 1990 to 2021. Our analysis considered various factors, including sex, age, region, and socio-demographic index. RESULTS: In 2021, DALYs attributable to SSBs there were 315,312 (95% uncertainty interval, 140,854 to 503,347) in absolute terms reflecting 518.3% (424.9 to 642.2) increase over three decades. From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized rate of DALYs attributable to SSBs increased by 118.5%, from 27.9 (11.4 to 43.9) to 61.0 (27.6 to 97.0) per 100,000 population. Qatar (246.7 [113.1 to 404.5]), Saudi Arabia (201.2 [87.1 to 314.2]), and Bahrain (180.1 [78.4 to 295.8]) had the highest age-standardized rate of DALYs. The highest attributable DALYs and mortality from SSBs consumption were due to diabetes mellitus in all countries in 1990 and 2021. In 2021, Qatar (224.7 [104.9 to 365.5]), Bahrain (167.0 [74.8 to 274.8]), and Saudi Arabia (153.1 [75.3 to 230.4]) had the three highest age-standardized rates of DALYs from diabetes mellitus attributed to SSBs. CONCLUSIONS: NAME witnessed a substantial increase in the burden attributable to SSBs. Alarmingly, exposure to SSBs has principally contributed to the increased burden of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Among the region's countries, exposure and attributable burden trends vary considerably. It is imperative that governments and health authorities within the NAME region work together to combat SSBs' detrimental effects. Local, socioeconomic, and educational factors need to be considered when developing prevention and treatment strategies at the individual, community, and national levels.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Higher-than-recommended sugar consumption (< 10% of total energy intake; WHO) leads to negative health impacts and the development of serious diseases. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) proved to be among the leading sources of free sugar intake, as they contain large amounts of added sugar. Our article aims to propose tax measures that will help change consumer behaviour and reduce SSBs consumption. METHODS: For a comparison of the forms of taxation, the experience of seven countries (Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Catalonia - Spain, and the UK) were analysed. The evolution of sugar consumption, consumption of sweetened drinks and obesity before and after the introduction and/or abolition of the sugar tax were reviewed. RESULTS: States that implemented a tax on SSBs were able to reduce SSBs consumption in the first year after the tax was introduced when states with a sugar-content-based tax have implemented it more effectively than states with a volume-based tax. Based on this finding, we propose basic design assumptions for the tax that can be used in European countries that have not yet introduced the tax. Progressive taxation divides beverages into 3 bands. The basic assumption is to encourage the desired consumer behaviour, i.e., consumption of SSBs with lower sugar content. The proposed tax design is applied to the conditions of the Czech Republic as a model case study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that SSBs taxation could be an effective policy intervention to improve population health by reducing the health impacts of SSBs among children and adolescents, although further studies are needed to prove the causality of the described associations.",

To address this concern, we culturally tailored and tested the feasibility of an evidence-based SSB-reducing curriculum. The modified curriculum was designed for Indigenous men and is thematically based on traditional values, ancestral teachings, and community strengths while promoting healthy lifestyles. A community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach was used to develop an interview guide using an Indigenous-centered theoretical framework. Two Indigenous content experts conducted both individual and focus group interviews (n = 14) with urban community leaders and athletes. Two Indigenous qualitative scientists analyzed the data with the support of an inter-tribal community advisory board. Results included imagery utilization, the importance of water, marketing, taste, and building routine. These findings guided the development of 6-month Indigenous focused SSB intervention consisting of 12 in-person intervention sessions and 27 short messaging service (SMS) messages.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with obesity, metabolic diseases, and incremental healthcare costs. Given their health consequences, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that countries implement taxes on SSB. Over the last 10 years, obesity prevalence has almost doubled in Brazil, yet, in 2016, the Brazilian government cut the existing federal SSB taxes to their current 4%. Since 2022, a bill to impose a 20% tax on SSB has been under discussion in the Brazilian Senate. To simulate the potential impact of increasing taxes on SSB in Brazil, we aimed to estimate the price-elasticity of SSB and the potential impact of a new 20% or 30% excise SSB tax on consumption, obesity prevalence, and cost savings. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using household purchases data from the Brazilian Household Budget Survey (POF) from 2017/2018, we estimated constant elasticity regressions. We used a log-log specification by income level for all beverage categories: (1) sugar-sweetened beverages; (2) alcoholic beverages; (3) unsweetened beverages; and (4) low-calorie or artificially sweetened beverages. We estimated the adult nationwide baseline intake for each beverage category using 24-h dietary recall data collected in 2017/2018. Taking group one as the taxed beverages, we applied the price and cross-price elasticities to the baseline intake data, we obtained changes in caloric intake. The caloric reduction was introduced into an individual dynamic model to estimate changes in weight and obesity prevalence. No benefits on cost savings were modeled during the first 3 years of intervention to account for the time lag in obesity cases to reduce costs. We multiplied the reduction in obesity cases during 7 years by the obesity costs per capita to predict the costs savings attributable to the sweetened beverage tax. SSB price elasticities were higher among the lowest tertile of income (-1.24) than in the highest income tertile (-1.13), and cross-price elasticities suggest SSB were weakly substituted by milk, water, and 100% fruit juices. We estimated a caloric change of -17.3 kcal/day/person under a 20% excise tax and -25.9 kcal/day/person under a 30% tax. Ten years after implementation, a 20% tax is expected to reduce obesity prevalence by 6.7%; 9.1% for a 30% tax. These reductions translate into a -2.8 million and -3.8 million obesity cases for a 20% and 30% tax, respectively, and a reduction of $US 13.3 billion and $US 17.9 billion in obesity costs over 10 years for a 20% and 30% tax, respectively. Study limitations include using a quantile distribution method to adjust self-reported baseline weight and height, which could be insufficient to correct for reporting bias; also, weight, height, and physical activity were assumed to be steady over time. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a 20% to 30% excise tax on top of Brazil's current federal tax could help to reduce the consumption of ultra-processed beverages, empty calories, and body weight while avoiding large health-related costs. Given the recent cuts to SSB taxes in Brazil, a program to revise and implement excise taxes could prove beneficial for the Brazilian population.",

A genetically determined size polymorphism in apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], determined by the number of Kringle (K) repeats, inversely regulates Lp(a) levels. Nongenetic factors including dietary saturated fat influence Lp(a) levels. However, less is known about the effects of carbohydrates including dietary sugars. In this double-blind, parallel arm study among 32 overweight/obese adults, we investigated the effect of consuming glucose- or fructose-sweetened beverages providing 25% of energy requirements for 10 weeks on Lp(a) level and assessed the role of the apo(a) size polymorphism. The mean (±SD) age of participants was 54 ± 8 years, 50% were women, and 75% were of European descent. Following the 10-week intervention, Lp(a) level was reduced by an average (±SEM) of -13.2% ± 4.3% in all participants (P = 0.005); -15.3% ± 7.8% in the 15 participants who consumed glucose (P = 0.07); and -11.3% ± 4.5% in the 17 participants who consumed fructose (P = 0.02), without any significant difference in the effect between the two sugar groups. Relative changes in Lp(a) levels were similar across subgroups of lower versus higher baseline Lp(a) level or carrier versus noncarrier of an atherogenic small (≤22K) apo(a) size. In contrast, LDL-C increased. In conclusion, in older, overweight/obese adults, consuming sugar-sweetened beverages reduced Lp(a) levels by ∼13% independently of apo(a) size variability and the type of sugar consumed. The Lp(a) response was opposite to that of LDL-C and triglyceride concentrations. These findings suggest that metabolic pathways might impact Lp(a) levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is a global health concern. Additionally, sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is disproportionately high among adolescents and adults in rural Appalachia. The primary study objective is to determine the intervention effects of Kids SIPsmartER on students' SSB consumption. Secondary objectives focus on caregivers' SSB consumption and secondary student and caregiver outcomes [e.g, body mass index (BMI), quality of life (QOL)]. METHODS: This Type 1 hybrid, cluster randomized controlled trial includes 12 Appalachian middle schools (6 randomized to Kids SIPsmartER and 6 to control). Kids SIPsmartER is a 6-month, 12 lesson, multi-level, school-based, behavior and health literacy program aimed at reducing SSB among 7th grade middle school students. The program also incorporates a two-way text message strategy for caregivers. In this primary prevention intervention, all 7th grade students and their caregivers from participating schools were eligible to participate, regardless of baseline SSB consumption. Validated instruments were used to assess SSB behaviors and QOL. Height and weight were objectively measured in students and self-reported by caregivers. Analyses included modified two-part models with time fixed effects that controlled for relevant demographics and included school cluster robust standard errors. RESULTS: Of the 526 students and 220 caregivers, mean (SD) ages were 12.7 (0.5) and 40.6 (6.7) years, respectively. Students were 55% female. Caregivers were mostly female (95%) and White (93%); 25% had a high school education or less and 33% had an annual household income less than $50,000. Regardless of SSB intake at baseline and relative to control participants, SSB significantly decreased among students [-7.2 ounces/day (95% CI = -10.7, -3.7); p < 0.001, effect size (ES) = 0.35] and caregivers [-6.3 ounces/day (95% CI = -11.3, -1.3); p = 0.014, ES = 0.33]. Among students (42%) and caregivers (28%) who consumed > 24 SSB ounces/day at baseline (i.e., high consumers), the ES increased to 0.45 and 0.95, respectively. There were no significant effects for student or caregiver QOL indicators or objectively measured student BMI; however, caregiver self-reported BMI significantly decreased in the intervention versus control schools (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Kids SIPsmartER was effective at reducing SSB consumption among students and their caregivers in the rural, medically underserved Appalachian region. Importantly, SSB effects were even stronger among students and caregivers who were high consumers at baseline. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clincialtrials.gov: NCT03740113.

METHODS: The study comprised longitudinal data retrieved from Finnish registries during the years 2011-2020. Basic oral treatment needs, and total operating cost of PDS, total excise tax revenue generated from sugary products and average sugar consumed (kg per capita) during the years 2011-2020 were obtained. Simplified panel analyses and sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate the effects of explanatory variables on outcomes.  Results: An approximate one EUR 1,000,000 increase in total excise tax revenue generated from sugary products corresponds to a 0.4% increase in total operating cost of PDS. There was a significant positive trend in total operating cost of PDS in Finland over the study period. Similarly, an approximate one EUR 1,000,000 rise in total excise tax revenue corresponds to a 0.2% increase in basic oral treatment needs. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference in the average excise tax revenue for sugary products between the periods before and after 2017. CONCLUSION: No change in average sugar consumption was observed despite implementing the new sugar policy. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to reconsider the excise tax on sweets and ice cream as it will significantly increase the total national revenues.",

In the first year, students in the Intervention Group received one-year intervention measures, including monthly monitoring, aiming to decrease the consumption of SSBs. Students in the Control Group only received regular monitoring without interventions. In the second year, both groups received only regular monitoring, without active interventions. A generalized estimating equations model (GEE) was used to assess the intervention effects. After two years, relative to the Control Group, the Intervention Group had a significantly improved knowledge of SSBs and an improved family environment with parents. In the Intervention Group, 477 students (97.3%) had adequate knowledge about SSBs, compared to 302 students (83.2%) in the Control Group (X2 = 52.708, p < 0.001). Two years later, the number of students who stated 'my home always has SSBs' in the Intervention Group (7.8%) was fewer than that in the Control Group (12.4%), which was a statistically significant finding (p < 0.05). One year later, both the frequency and the quantity of SSB consumption in the Intervention Group were less than those in the Control Group; such differences between the groups remained statistically significant for the quantity but not for the frequency of SSB consumption two years later. In the Intervention Group, the frequency of SSB consumption was significantly reduced by 1.0 times per week, compared to a reduction of 0.1 times per week in the Control Group in the first year (p < 0.05). In the second year, the frequency of SSB consumption was reduced by 0.8 times per week in the Intervention Group, compared to 0.5 times per week in the Control Group (p > 0.05). In the first year, the volume of SSB consumption was significantly reduced by 233 mL per week in the Intervention Group, compared to an increase of 107 mL per week in the Control Group (p < 0.05). In the second year, the volume of SSB consumption was reduced by 122 mL per week in the Intervention Group compared to an increase of 31 mL per week in the Control Group (p > 0.05). The combined school-based and family-based interventions had a positive effect on the students' knowledge of SSBs and their family dynamics during the first and second year. Relative to the Control Group, the Intervention Group had a statistically significant reduction in SSB consumption after 1 year, but not after 2 years.",

It is uncertain if replacing an existing use of sugar-sweetened beverages with non-caloric beverages results in long-term reduction in body weight. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore if a long-term reduction in body weight can be achieved by replacing an existing intake of sugar-sweetened beverages with non-caloric beverages. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for literature. Studies with a \"substitution\" design were included, that is, studies where subjects substituted an existing intake of sugar-sweetened beverages with either artificially sweetened beverages or unsweetened beverages/water. Studies with 6 months or longer follow-up of weight change were included. RESULTS: Six trials with a total of 1729 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Replacing an existing intake of sugar-sweetened beverages with a non-caloric beverage resulted in a long-term BMI reduction of 0.31 kg/m2 compared with the sugar-sweetened beverage-group (95% CI; 0.17-0.44). One study with 1 year's intervention and 2 years follow-up showed a regression towards baseline BMI after the intervention had ended. CONCLUSION: Replacing an existing use of sugar-sweetened beverages with artificially sweetened beverages or unsweetened beverages resulted in a long-term 0.31 kg/m2 reduction in BMI equivalent to 0.5-1 kg in children and adults, respectively, as long as the interventions lasted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of actions to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage (SB) consumption in children still needs to be improved. Furthermore, the growing concern about sustainable food systems encourages to develop sustainability-based interventions. The objective of this cluster randomised controlled trial is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of nutrition- and environmental sustainability-based interventions on the reduction in SB intake and on the increase in tap water consumption in 3rd to 6th grade primary school children (8 to 11 years of age). METHODS: Forty-eight French-speaking Belgian primary schools (equivalent to around 3500 pupils involved in the evaluation) are randomised using a factorial plan: (i) control, (ii) nutrition-based intervention, (iii) sustainability-based intervention, and (iv) both. The interventions (encouragement of water breaks; provision of posters, leaflets, reusable cups, and glass bottles; website; meetings at school) were undertaken from February 2022 to June 2023. Evaluation includes questionnaires for the children and their parents on various determinants of dietary behaviour, a 4-day diary to collect information on the child's beverage consumption, and audits at schools. The first evaluation was conducted in Spring 2021 before any intervention, with the two post-intervention evaluations being held in 2022 and 2023. The main quantitative judgement criterion will be the change over time in the mean SB consumption (in ml/day) in the intervention groups compared with the control group. Given the context of the research (school), the safety of the intervention, and the content of data collection, a consent was acknowledged as unnecessary by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Psychology (ULB; n°073/2021), but children and parents are explicitly informed of their right to refuse to fill in the questionnaires. DISCUSSION: Multicomponent interventions based on nutrition and on environmental sustainability, alone or mixed, will provide an original and topical insight into health promotion at school around dietary behaviours. The dissemination plan will enable to widely inform stakeholders, school staff, and families, in addition to the scientific community through the usual medium (articles, conferences), about the research findings in 2024-2025.

This research aimed to determine the association between smartphone usage and dietary consumption of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages among young female adults in Indonesia. This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey in Malang City. There were 217 female university students aged 18-25 years old who were eligible as participants. The dependent variable was a preference for SSBs consumption, while the independent variables included sociodemographics, BMI, food allergies, smartphone usage, and dietary habits. Chi-square and binary logistics were used to analyse the association between independent variables and SSBs. The results showed that 62.2% of respondents preferred to consume SSBs, and 12.9% of participants were classified as overnutrition (BMi>25). More than half of the respondents had breakfast every day, and a majority of them like to consume high carbohydrates (96.8%) and high-sugar snacks (55.3%). The binary logistic regression showed an association between BMI status, breakfast consumption, watching movies, and eating frequency with high sugar beverage consumption preference (p<0.05). Reducing sugar beverages consumption intervention should consider using media accessible with smartphone."

      "abstract": "Dental caries is the most prevalent oral disease across the life course. This study modeled the population health and economic impact of a 20% sugar sweetened beverages tax (SSB) for preventing dental caries compared to no intervention (societal and healthcare perspective). A cost-effectiveness analysis according to quintiles of area-level socioeconomic disadvantage was performed for the 2020 Australian population (0-100 years old) using a closed cohort Markov model. A qualitative assessment of implementation considerations (e.g., acceptability, equity, sustainability) was undertaken. Health outcomes were modeled as decayed teeth prevented and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. The 10-year and lifetime scenarios were modeled with probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Monte Carlo simulation, 2000 cycles). The 10-year scenario from a societal perspective yielded cost-savings of AUD$63.5M, healthcare cost-savings of AUD$42.2M, 510,977 decayed teeth averted and 98.1 DALYs averted. The lifetime scenario resulted in societal cost savings of AUD$176.6M, healthcare cost-savings of AUD$122.5M, 1,309,211 decayed teeth averted and 254.9 DALYs averted. Modeling indicated 71.5% and 74.5% cost-effectiveness for the 10-year and lifetime scenarios, respectively. A three-fold health benefit for the least advantaged was found compared to the most advantaged. A 20% SSB tax in Australia is cost-effective and promotes health equity.",

DESIGN: A controlled trial of ethnically diverse, full-time employees who consumed SSB heavily (sales ban n 315; control n 342). Outcomes included standardised measures of change in SSB consumption in the workplace (primary) and at home between baseline and 6 months post-sales ban. SETTING: Sutter Health, a large non-profit healthcare delivery system in Northern California. PARTICIPANTS: Full-time employees at Sutter Health screened for heavy SSB consumption. RESULTS: Participants were 66·1 % non-White. On average, participants consumed 34·7 ounces (about 1 litre) of SSB per d, and the majority had an elevated baseline BMI (mean = 29·5). In adjusted regression analyses, those exposed to a workplace SSB sales ban for 6 months consumed 2·7 (95 % CI -4·9, -0·5) fewer ounces of SSB per d while at work, and 4·3 (95 % CI -8·4, -0·2) fewer total ounces per d, compared to controls. Sales ban participants with an elevated BMI or waist circumference had greater post-intervention reductions in workplace SSB consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace sales bans can reduce SSB consumption in ethnically diverse employee populations, including those at higher risk for cardiometabolic disease.",

Over 22 weeks, caregivers of seventh graders in 10 Appalachian middle schools received a two-way SMS Baseline Assessment and four monthly follow-up assessments to report their and their child's SSB intake and select a personalized strategy topic. Between assessments, caregivers received two weekly one-way messages: one information or infographic message and one strategy message. Of 1873 caregivers, 542 (29%) enrolled by completing the SMS Baseline Assessment. Three-quarters completed Assessments 2-5, with 84% retained at Assessment 5. Reminders, used to encourage adherence, improved completion by 19-40%, with 18-33% completing after the first two reminders. Most caregivers (72-93%) selected a personalized strategy and an average of 28% viewed infographic messages. Between Baseline and Assessment 5, daily SSB intake frequency significantly (p < 0.01) declined for caregivers (-0.32 (0.03), effect size (ES) = 0.51) and children (-0.26 (0.01), ES = 0.53). Effect sizes increased when limited to participants who consumed SSB twice or more per week (caregivers ES = 0.65, children ES = 0.67). Findings indicate that an SMS-delivered intervention is promising for engaging rural caregivers of middle school students and improving SSB behaviors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To avoid the low engagement and limited efficacy of digital behavioral health interventions, robust human-centered design (HCD) processes are needed. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to describe a flexible, step-by-step HCD process to develop digital behavioral health interventions by illustrating iSIPsmarter as an example. iSIPsmarter is a digital intervention for reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) that comprises 6 internet-based cores metered out over time to deliver the program content, an integrated SMS text message strategy to engage users in reporting SSB behaviors, and an electronic cellular-enabled scale for in-home weighing. The secondary objective is to illustrate the key components and characteristics of iSIPsmarter that resulted from the HCD process. METHODS: The methods were guided by the Model for Internet Interventions and by best practices in HCD and instructional design processes (eg, rapid prototype development and think-aloud protocol). The 3-phased (ie, contextual, prototype testing, end user testing phases) process followed in this study included a series of 13 semistructured one-on-one interviews with 7 advisory team participants from the targeted Appalachian user group. The interviews were content coded by 2 researchers and then deductively coded to the suggested areas of digital behavioral health interventions. RESULTS: The participants provided rich perspectives pertaining to iSIPsmarter's appearance, behavioral prescriptions, burdens, content, delivery, message, participation, and assessment. These inputs included requests for built-in flexibility to account for varying internet and SMS text message accessibility among users; ideas to resolve the issues and problems encountered when using the prototypes, including those related to navigation and comprehension of content; ideas to enhance personalized feedback to support motivation and goal setting for SSB consumption and weight; and feedback to refine the development of realistic and relatable vignettes. The participants were able to interact with multiple prototype drafts, allowing researchers to capture and incorporate feedback related to the iSIPsmarter dashboard, daily SSB and weight diaries, action planning, core content, interactions, and vignettes. CONCLUSIONS: Using scientific models and established processes is critical for building robust and efficacious interventions. By applying an existing model and HCD and instructional design processes, we were able to identify assumptions and address the key areas of the iSIPsmarter intervention that were hypothesized to support users' engagement and promote behavior change. As evidenced by the rich feedback received from the advisory team members and the resulting iSIPsmarter product, the HCD methodology was instrumental in the development process. Although the final iSIPsmarter content is specific to improving SSB consumption behaviors among adults in rural areas, the intent is that this HCD process will have wide applications in the development of digital behavioral health interventions across multiple geographic and behavioral contexts."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is among the main risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This study aimed to estimate the financial costs of hospitalizations and procedures of high and medium complexity for NCDs attributable to the consumption of SSBs in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in 2019. METHODS: This ecological study used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 and the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS). The attributable costs were estimated from the population-attributable fraction (PAF) and the costs in the treatment of chronic diseases [type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease (IHD)], stratified by sex, age group, level of complexity of treatment, and federative units. RESULTS: In 2019, in Brazil, US$ 14,116,240.55 were the costs of hospitalizations and procedures of high and medium complexity in the treatment of NCDs attributable to the consumption of SSBs. These values were higher in males (US$ 8,469,265.14) and the southeast and southern regions, mainly in the state of São Paulo. However, when evaluating these results at a rate per 10,000 inhabitants, it was observed that the states of Paraná, Tocantins, and Roraima had higher costs per 10,000 inhabitants. Regarding the age groups, higher costs were observed in the older age groups. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the high financial impact of the NCDs treatment attributed to the consumption of SSBs in Brazil and the variability among Brazilian macro-regions. The results demonstrate the urgency and need for the expansion of policies to reduce the consumption of SSBs in Brazil with strategies that consider regional particularities."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity and the associated non-communicable diseases contribute significantly to the disease burden in Tanzania. Obesity can be attributed to the consumption of Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSB) due to their high sugar content that leads to high caloric intakes. This study estimates the effect of SSB tax on the prevalence of obesity. METHODS: A mathematical model that compares the reference population which is unchanged and a counterfactual population in which tax intervention has been introduced is developed. Changes in price and consumption of SSBs, and subsequent changes in energy intake are applied to estimate the body mass change by age groups. The change in body mass by age groups is merged with the reference population to estimate changes in body mass index and obesity. RESULTS: Imposing a 20% SSB tax in Tanzania is estimated to reduce the average overall energy intake by 76.1 kJ per person per day. This change is associated with an overall reduction of prevalence of obesity by 6.6%; and by 12.9% and 5.2% in adult males and adult females, respectively. The number of obese people will potentially decrease by about 47,000 among adult males and about 85,000 among adult females from the current levels. CONCLUSIONS: The SSB tax is a potential strategy to complement efforts to reduce obesity prevalence in Tanzania. The revenue generated from the tax should be channelled towards public health promotion programs."

Primary studies that evaluated the impact of any kind of SSB tax on oral health-related outcomes (that is, decayed, missing and filled teeth, caries increment and dental treatment costs) were included.Data synthesis Of 503 search results, five studies met the inclusion criteria. All five were modelling studies, from which four studies predicted an SSB tax to have a positive impact on oral health-related outcomes, whereas one study in a developing country did not find an SSB tax to be solely successful. According to three studies, the younger population and men are likely to benefit the most from such a tax. One study demonstrated the benefits of an SSB tax to be potentially more significant among low-income individuals.Conclusion While no empirical studies are available to support the benefits of an SSB tax, the studies covered in this review altogether anticipate a positive impact. Furthermore, this review discusses some of the obstacles and limitations of implementing such a tax predicted by the included studies."

      "abstract": "Human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a multifaceted metabolic regulator considered to control sugar intake and to exert beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Elevated serum FGF21 levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, suggesting a state of FGF21 resistance. Further, given the evidence of a hepatic ChREBP and FGF21 signaling axis, it can be assumed that SSBs containing fructose would possibly increase FGF21 concentrations. We investigated the effects of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption on fasting FGF21 levels in healthy, lean men, discriminating the effects of glucose, fructose, and their disaccharide sucrose by secondary data analysis from a randomized controlled trial. Seven weeks of daily SSB consumption resulted in increased fasting FGF21 in healthy, lean men, irrespective of the sugar type. Medians of ΔFGF21 between post-SSB intervention values (week 7) and no-intervention period values (IQR) in pg/mL were: glucose 17.4 (0.4-45.8), fructose 22.9 (-8.6-35.1), and sucrose 13.7 (2.2-46.1). In contrast, this change in FGF21 concentration was only 6.3 (-20.1-26.9) pg/mL in the control group. The lack of a fructose-specific effect on FGF21 concentrations is contrary to our assumption. It is concluded that SSB intake may impact FGF21 concentrations and could contribute to the increased FGF21 concentrations observed in subjects suffering from metabolic syndrome that is possibly associated with decreased FGF21 responsiveness.",

      "abstract": "To examine whether reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is associated with reduced body mass index z-score gain among Chinese schoolchildren in Nanjing, China, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in four selected primary schools from September 2019 to September 2020. Students in the third grade in the Intervention Group received school-based and home-based interventions for two consecutive semesters to reduce SSB consumption, while two schools in the Control Group did not receive any interventions. Weight changes were expressed as body mass index (BMI) z-scores as standard deviations of the BMI distribution per age and sex group. Changes in SSB consumption before and after the interventions were categorized into Level-Up if it increased, Level-Same if it was maintained and Level-Down if it decreased. Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore the association of different levels of changes in SSB consumption pre- and post-intervention with the BMI z-score. Among 1633 participants who completed the trial, the mean age at baseline was 9.36 years (±0.48 SD).The median baseline BMI z-score was −0.24 (25th percentile −0.72; 75th percentile 0.58). After the intervention, the median BMI z-score increased by 0.06 (−0.17~0.37) in the Intervention Group and by 0.14 (−0.08~0.41) in the Control Group (p < 0.001). A higher increase in BMI was found in the Control Group than in the Intervention Group (1.20 vs. 0.94) during the 12-month period. Among participants whose parents’ educational attainment was above 9 years, the median BMI z-score increased by 0.07 (−0.17~0.37) in the Intervention Group and by 0.16 (−0.06~0.41) in the Control Group (p < 0.001). In a linear regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders, the BMI z-score decreased by 0.057 more in Level-Down than in Level-Up (95% CI: −0.103 to −0.012, p = 0.014). These results indicate that the decreased consumption of SSBs might have reduced the prevalence of overweight in schoolchildren in China, especially in students whose parents had high educational levels.",

Parents in both groups had reported statistically significant reductions in sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and increases in water intake post-intervention. DESIGN: Qualitative explanatory in-depth interviews analysed thematically and deductively. SETTING: Washington, DC metropolitan area, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Low-income Latino parents of infants/toddlers who had participated in the Water Up! @Home randomised controlled trial. RESULTS: The filter-stimulated water consumption in both groups by (1) increasing parents' perception of water safety; (2) acting as a cue to action to drink water; (3) improving the flavour of water (which was linked to perceptions of safety) and (4) increasing the perception that this option was more economical than purchasing bottled water. Safe and palatable drinking water was more accessible and freely available in their homes; participants felt they did not need to ration their water consumption as before. Only intervention participants were able to describe a reduction in SSB intake and described strategies, skills and knowledge gained to reduce SSB intake. Among the comparison group, there was no thematic consensus about changes in SSB or any strategies or skills to reduce SSB intake. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost water filter facilitated water consumption, which actively (or passively for comparison group) displaced SSB consumption. The findings have implications for understanding and addressing the role of water security on SSB consumption.",

The solution is therefore highly entangled in the complex of social and intersectoral interests generating a number of opportunities and threats affecting its feasibility. AIMS: The study aims to depict the views of Polish stakeholders on the implementation of the sugar tax in Poland, particularly the perception of success determinants, barriers, as well as views on the features of the implemented solutions and possible alternatives. METHODS: We used semi-structured interviews with 18 individuals representing key public health stakeholders in Poland. The interview consisted of four parts, where first concentrated on the advantages and disadvantages of the SSB tax, the second part explored stakeholder involvement and stances, third concerned the feasibility of the project, and in the fourth part respondents were asked for suggestions for decision-makers regarding the content of the project and its implementation process. To reconstruct position of 4 main political parties we applied desk research. We used MAXQDA v2020 to analyse the collected data. RESULTS: Stakeholders tend to expressed conflicting views on the effectiveness, relevance and socio-economic impact of the SSB tax. All of them agreed that the tax may appear severe for the poorest groups, children and adolescents, while disagreeing about the economic impact of the levy. The allocation of additional tax revenues was raising doubts, with stakeholders believing that the fiscal aim is the basic reason for implementing the tax, while these resources should be primarily dedicated to health promotion intervention and prevention of diet-related diseases. On the other hand, the political debate on the tax was highly superficial with strong populism arising of the presented positions. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to conduct a thorough public debate and improvements in terms of public communication to increase social awareness, sealing and refining the implemented solutions. Close cooperation with market players and non-governmental organizations is highly recommended."

This is the first study to analyze the Spanish population’s support for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. (2) Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of a representative sample of the Spanish adult population (n = 1002), using a computer-aided telephone interview with a questionnaire on nutritional policies. The support for the tax was calculated by the percentage of those who agreed plus those who strongly agreed with the measure. The sociodemographic determinants of support for the tax were analyzed using chi-squared test (χ2) and Poisson multiple regression models with robust variance. (3) Results: Of the participants, 66.9% supported a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Support for the tax was 9.2% higher (70% vs. 64.1%) when responders were first asked about support for tax relief and subsidies for healthy foods (p = 0.049). Support for the tax was 16% and 35% lower among persons reporting center and right-wing political sympathies (p < 0.01), and 16% lower among regular consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages (p = 0.01). (4) Conclusions: A clear majority of the Spanish population is in favor of imposing a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Awareness-raising campaigns and a policy of combining the measure with subsidies or tax cuts on healthy foods could increase the level of support among those currently against the intervention.",

We included three experimental (n = 508) and one control school (n = 164) in Slovenia (672 children; 10-16 years) to evaluate interventions that influence behaviour change via environmental (E), communication (C), or combined (i.e., double) environmental and communication approaches (EC) compared to no intervention (NOI). Data of children from the 'intervention' and 'non-intervention' schools were compared before and after the interventions. The quantity of water consumed (average, mL/day) by children increased in the C and EC schools, while it decreased in the E and NOI schools. Children in the C and EC schools consumed less beverages with sugar (SSBs + fruit juices), and sweet beverages (beverages with: sugar, low-calorie and/or noncaloric sweeteners) but consumed more juices. The awareness about the health risks of SSB consumption improved among children of the 'combined intervention' EC school and was significantly different from the awareness among children of other schools (p = 0.03). A communication intervention in the school environment has more potential to reduce the intake of SSBs than a sole environmental intervention, but optimum results can be obtained when combined with environmental changes.",

DESIGN: We conducted a comprehensive Ovid Medline and Scopus search. Articles had to be peer-reviewed, full-text and published in English. Studies had to be controlled intervention, published between 1 January 2010 to 7 February 2021, and in children and adolescents. Study quality was measured using the Quality Assessment Tool for Controlled Intervention Studies. RESULTS: Forty intervention articles were included in this review involving 25,069 children and adolescents. All studies employed a quantitative research method using the Randomized Controlled Trial designs. Twenty-eight out of forty interventions used psychosocial theories. Study quality ranged from 'fair' to 'good.' Results showed that education intervention effectively reduced SSBs, and reduced 100% fruit juice in children. EXPERT OPINION: Reducing the SSBs consumption in children should be initiated by conducting school-based programs consisting of interactive learning process, psychosocial theories and the involvement of parents or caregivers. Theories that focus on personal, behavior and environment factors improve the effectiveness of the intervention. More research is warranted to investigate the impacts of 100% fruit juice on obesity, dental caries and risk of co-morbidities in children.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The World Health Organisation urges countries to levy specific excise taxes on SSBs. Currently, more than 50 countries have introduced some type of tax on SSBs. In March 2017, the Autonomous Region of Catalonia approved the introduction of a tiered excise tax on SSBs for public health reasons. To evaluate the effect of the Catalonian excise tax on the price and purchase of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and their possible substitutes, i.e., non-sugar-sweetened beverages (NSSBs) and bottled water, three and half years after its introduction, and 1 year after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analysed purchase data on soft drinks, fruit drinks and water, sourced from the Ministry of Agriculture food-consumption panel, in a random sample of 12,500 households across Spain. We applied the synthetic control method to infer the causal impact of the intervention, based on a Bayesian structural time-series model which predicts the counterfactual response that would have occurred in Catalonia, had no intervention taken place. RESULTS: As compared to the predicted (counterfactual) response, per capita purchases of SSBs fell by 0.17 l three and a half years after implementing the SSB tax in Catalonia, a 16.7% decline (95% CI: - 23.18, - 8.74). The mean SSB price rose by 0.11 €/L, an 11% increase (95% CI: 9.0, 14.1). Although there were no changes in mean NSSB prices, NSSB consumption rose by 0.19 l per capita, a 21.7% increase (95% CI: 18.25, 25.54). There were no variations in the price or consumption of bottled water. The effects were progressively greater over time, with SSB purchases decreasing by 10.4% at 1 year, 12.3% at 2 years, 15.3% at 3 years, and 16.7% at three and a half years of the tax's introduction. CONCLUSIONS: The Catalonian SSB excise tax had a sustained and progressive impact over time, with a fall in consumption of as much as 16.7% three and half years after its introduction. The observed NSSB substitution effect should be borne in mind when considering the application of this type of tax to the rest of Spain.",

A multi-stage cluster random sampling method was applied to select four primary schools, two in urban areas and two in rural areas, in Nanjing, eastern China. Classes of the third grade in the selected four schools were randomly assigned to the intervention group and control group. Among selected students in those classes, aged 9-10 years, those in the intervention group received intervention measures comprising school-based and family-based measures and accepted monthly monitoring along with interventions, for two consecutive semesters, while those in the control group did not receive any specific interventions. After intervention, there was a significant increase in SSB knowledge and an improvement in the family environment with parents in the intervention group. The proportion of frequent consumption (≥4 times/week) of any SSBs in the intervention group was lower than that in the control group (31.5% vs. 56.2%, p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated that parental education level is positively associated with reduced SSB consumption. Interventions showed an average decrease in SSBs consumption by 1.77 units, those living in urban areas decreased by 2.05 units. The combination of school-based and family-based interventions appears effective in reducing SSB consumption among Chinese schoolchildren, especially in urban areas and for those with parents with lower educational levels.",

A large body of evidence identifies specific features that increase message efficacy, including tailoring messages to the target audience and using a storytelling format. Yet most message testing research has focused on individual-level outcomes, ignoring the social and environmental determinants of health behaviors, which require collective action and political will to change. Grounded in an ecological approach to communication, we will carry out two double-blinded randomized experiments to test the relative effectiveness of message tailoring (culturally-tailored vs. standard) and format (narrative vs. didactic) to increase the intention to reduce individual sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, the understanding of social and commercial determinants of health, and the sense of empowerment among young adult Latinas. Based on power analyses (80% power at alpha = 0.05), we will randomize 438 participants to two groups (traditional standard infographic and culturally-tailored infographic) in the first study, and 662 participants to two groups (culturally-tailored infographic and culturally-tailored comic book) in the second study. All participants will be measured by a pre-treatment test and an immediate post-treatment test. We hypothesize that culturally-tailored comic book will be most effective, and traditional standard infographic will be least effective, on all levels of outcomes. This study will provide empirical evidence in communication strategies to help young Latinos or other racial/ethnic minority young people to pursue positive dietary behaviors that both benefit themselves and contribute to change of social norms.",

      "abstract": "ISSUE ADDRESSED: This study investigated the impact of removing sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) from sale in a regional health service. Drink purchasing patterns were measured by product ordering data. Consumer opinion regarding the intervention, self-reported packaged drink purchase and consumption were also explored. METHODS: Packaged drinks were classified into two categories, SSB or non-SSB and drink types. Drink sales were determined by the collection of product ordering data for all packaged drink types sold, six months prior to and twelve months after the removal of SSBs. A consumer survey was undertaken six months after SSB removal to assess consumer opinion regarding SSB removal, self-reported SSB consumption and purchase. Descriptive and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests analyses assessed differences in packaged drinks purchase, self-reported SSB consumption and purchase. Open-ended survey responses were thematically analysed. RESULTS: The median monthly number of juices, and diet drinks ordered increased significantly (P = .05). 59% of the survey respondents regularly consumed SSBs and 58% agreed or strongly agreed with removing SSBs from sale. However, some consumers felt it was a removal of their freedom of choice. CONCLUSIONS: Removing SSBs from sale can result in consumers making healthier purchases. There was support for the initiative as it is seen as the responsibility of the health service to role model healthy eating behaviours. SO WHAT?: This study indicates removal of SSBs from sale is a promising health promotion intervention that can contribute to positive behaviour change, and potentially influence longer-term health and wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "The design and implementation of applications for behavior change should be preceded by careful analysis of the behavior change process and the target population. We, therefore, present on the basis of a blended research approach a rationale, opportunities and basic requirements for an application that offers a program for reducing intake of sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) by adolescents. This paper discusses the role of e-coaching and gamification as two high-touch design patterns in the behavior change process. Both design patterns aim at supporting the individual in a transformational journey from a current state toward a desired state where the detrimental behavior should be replaced by healthy alternative behavior. First, an elementary behavior scheme is introduced that frames three empirical studies. In the first study (plenary focus groups; n = 13), participants advised to include system recommendations for alternative healthy behavior, stressed the need for personalization of the e-coach and showed strong appreciation for the inclusion of gamification elements. The second study (online survey; n = 249) showed that SSB-intake is highly contextual and that reasons for (limiting) consumption SSB varies greatly between individuals, which the e-coach application should take into account. In a final small-scale pilot study (n = 27), we observed the potential of the inclusion of gamification elements, such as challenges and rewards, to increase compliance to the self-monitoring process of SSB consumption. Building upon these insights and prior studies, we argue that an e-coach mimics the collaborative practice of the program; its main task is to enrich the interaction with cooperative conversational experiences, in particular with respect to the alignment between user and system, motivational encouragement, personalized advice, and feedback about the activities. In addition, we outline that gamification not only has the potential to increase self-monitoring of the target behavior, user engagement, and commitment with the intervention program, but also enables a designer to shift long-term negative outcome of excessive intake in real life to short-term consequences in a virtual environment. In future larger follow-up studies, we advise to integrate the two design patterns within a social network of virtual and human agents that play a variety of competitive, normative and supportive roles."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the prolongation of life expectancy, the gap between lifespan and \"health span,\" the disease-free lifespan, has been widening due to the massive burden of age-related chronic diseases and research on healthy aging has been gaining momentum. A growing body of evidence suggests that diet is a strong determinant of healthy aging and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), a major source of added sugars, predicts poor health outcomes in the aging population, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Evidence further supports a link between sugar-sweetened beverages-triggered pathological processes and biologic factors of aging, including inflammaging, oxidative stress, and alterations in intestinal microbiota. At present, substitution of sugar-sweetened beverages with healthier alternative beverage remains the most robust strategy to limit the deleterious effects of sugar-sweetened beverages on health worldwide and may help achieve healthy longevity. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of mechanisms by which sugar-sweetened beverages consumption may impact the physiological aging process and how a simple intervention of beverage replacement may promote healthy aging. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings indicate that SSB are associated with accelerated aging phenotype and activate various adverse biological processes such as chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and gut dysbiosis. Replacing SSB with healthier beverages may be a reasonable option to reduce the burden of chronic disease in the aging population and even prolong life and healthspan.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While policies to address \"obesity\" have existed for decades, they have commonly focused on behavioral interventions. More recently, the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages is gaining traction globally. This study sought to explore individuals' attitudes and beliefs about sugar-sweetened beverages being taxed in a rural Michigan setting. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted using critical policy analysis. Data were collected in 25 semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews with adult Michiganders. Following data collection, transcripts were coded into themes using NVivo software. RESULTS: Four themes emerged in participants' perspectives regarding sugar-sweetened beverages being taxed: resistance, unfamiliarity, tax effects, and need for education. While some participants were unfamiliar with sugar-sweetened beverage taxes, many viewed taxation as a \"slippery slope\" of government intervention, which invoked feelings of mistrust. In addition, participants predicted a sugar-sweetened beverage tax would be ineffective at reducing intake, particularly among regular consumers, who were frequently perceived as mostly low income and/or of higher weight. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to explore perceptions of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes in different geographic areas in the USA to examine how perceptions vary. Policymakers should be aware of the potential implications of this health policy with respect to government trust and stigma towards lower income and higher-weight individuals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Around 184,000 deaths per year could be attributable to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption worldwide. Epidemiological and decision models are important tools to estimate disease burden. The purpose of this study was to identify models to assess the burden of diseases attributable to SSBs consumption or the potential impact of health interventions. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review and literature search up to August 2018. Pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted, and assessed the quality of the included studies through an exhaustive description of each model's features. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. The inclusion criteria were epidemiological or decision models evaluating SSBs health interventions or policies, and descriptive SSBs studies of decision models. Studies published before 2003, cost of illness studies and economic evaluations based on individual patient data were excluded. RESULTS: We identified a total of 2766 references. Out of the 40 included studies, 45% were models specifically developed to address SSBs, 82.5% were conducted in high-income countries and 57.5% considered a health system perspective. The most common model's outcomes were obesity/overweight (82.5%), diabetes (72.5%), cardiovascular disease (60%), mortality (52.5%), direct medical costs (57.35%), and healthy years -DALYs/QALYs- (40%) attributable to SSBs. 67.5% of the studies modelled the effect of SSBs on the outcomes either entirely through BMI or through BMI plus diabetes independently. Models were usually populated with inputs from national surveys -such us obesity prevalence, SSBs consumption-; and vital statistics (67.5%). Only 55% reported results by gender and 40% included children; 30% presented results by income level, and 25% by selected vulnerable groups. Most of the models evaluated at least one policy intervention to reduce SSBs consumption (92.5%), taxes being the most frequent strategy (75%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide range of modelling approaches of different complexity and information requirements to evaluate the burden of disease attributable to SSBs. Most of them take into account the impact on obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, mortality, and economic impact. Incorporating these tools to different countries could result in useful information for decision makers and the general population to promote a deeper implementation of policies to reduce SSBs consumption.

Fifty-six healthy participants, with a self-reported SSB consumption of at least 330 ml per day, were randomized to 6 sessions of real or sham AAT. In the real AAT condition, participants were trained to react with avoidance movements to pictures of SSBs in an implicit learning paradigm (i.e. participants were instructed to respond to a task-irrelevant feature), whereas in the sham AAT condition the same pictures were used but no systematic (avoidance) reaction was trained. Approach bias, craving for SSB and SSB intake in a bogus taste test were assessed. Real AAT was not superior to sham AAT in any outcome measure. AAT in its current form and as a stand-alone intervention does not appear to be effective in reducing SSB consumption.",

This trial aimed to assess the impact of school environmental strategies, delivered as part of a broader intervention, among Year 7-9 students' SSB consumption. METHODS: Between March and July 2018, we conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial with 862 students attending six secondary schools (3 intervention and 3 control) in New South Wales. The intervention targeted SSB availability, placement, promotion and pricing, and increased availability and promotion of water. Control schools followed their usual programmes. Primary outcomes included mean daily SSB consumption (millilitres) and mean daily percentage energy from SSB (kilojoules). Sub-group analysis explored primary outcomes for gender, school year level and frequency of canteen use. RESULTS: Of the 2265 eligible students, 1092 (50.2%) provided active parental consent and 940 (86.0%) participated in baseline data collection. No significant differences were observed between groups at follow-up for mean daily SSBs consumed (-10.17 mL, CI: -24.78; 45.12, P = 0.57) or mean daily percentage energy from SSBs (-0.20%, CI: -0.87; 0.47, P = .56). Significant effects were observed among girls in intervention compared to girls in control schools for mean daily SSB consumption (-52.02 mL, CI 99.8; 94.14, P = .03) and mean daily percentage of energy from SSBs (-0.90%, CI: -1.82; 0.02, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: At 3-month mid-intervention evaluation, the intervention failed to impact on mean daily consumption and mean percentage energy from SSBs, overall. However, an intervention effect was observed in girls. The limited overall effect is likely due to inadequate intervention dose related to the short duration, limiting opportunities for schools to fully implement the environmental strategies. SO WHAT?: A longer intervention duration with additional implementation support to allow adequate time to embed the strategies within the school is recommended. Implementation support strategies would ensure staff are supported throughout the process.",

Regular cola purchases decreased 12.1% and their penetration rate decreased by 1.27 points during the two post-intervention years using the preferred model. Diet cola purchases increased 17.0% and their penetration rate also increased by 1.65 points. Only regular cola results were robust to all placebo test checks.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to synthesize the evidence on the effect of sugar- or health-related sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) warning labels or signage on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs, and SSB purchase and consumption. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases - Ovid Medline, Emerald Insight, Scopus, Informit, Business Source Complete, CINAHL, Global Health, PsychINFO, and SocIndex - were searched along with grey literature from inception to December 2019. The PRISMA guidelines were applied for reporting this systematic review. STUDY SELECTION: Studies examining the impact of front of pack (FOP) labels and/or point of sale (POS) signage highlighting added sugar content or its health risks were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted data on items, including study details, study design, population characteristics, intervention label details (type, duration, and settings), and outcomes measures. The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool was used to assess the study quality. DATA ANALYSIS: Findings were synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies published between 1992 and 2019 were included. Of these, 16 studies examined the impact of FOP labels and 5 studies examined the impact of POS signage. Both FOP labels and POS signage were associated with improved health knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding SSBs and reduced SSB purchases. Warning labels with diet-related health consequences were found to be particularly effective. Overall quality of studies was assessed as mixed. CONCLUSION: Health- or sugar-related FOP labels and POS signage for SSBs are promising public health measures and may improve consumers' health behaviors toward reduced SSB purchase and consumption.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization highlights fiscal policies as priority interventions for the promotion of healthy eating in its Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases. The taxation of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) in particular is noted to be an effective measure, and SSBs taxes have already been implemented in several countries worldwide. However, although the evidence base suggests that this will be effective in helping to combat rising obesity rates, opponents of SSBs taxation argue that it is illiberal and paternalistic, and therefore should be avoided. Bioethical analysis may play an essential role in clarifying whether policymakers should adopt SSBs taxes as part of wider obesity strategy. In this article we argue that no single ethical theory can account for the complexities inherent in obesity prevention strategy, especially the liberal theories relied upon by opponents of SSBs taxation. We contend that a pluralist approach to the ethics of SSBs taxation must be adopted as the only suitable way of accounting for the multiple overlapping, and sometimes, conflicting factors that are relevant to determining the moral acceptability of such an intervention.",

The Chi-square test was employed to analyze the association between consumption and non-consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and biochemical and anthropometric factors. The sample consisted of 2,172 individuals, mostly men (58.5%), elderly (63.6%), C-rated economic class (57.3%), and overweight (62.7%). A statistically significant difference was found between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and higher BMI values (p=0.029), waist circumference (p=0.004) and triglycerides (p=0.023). These results emphasize the need for nutritional intervention regarding the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages as part of the dietary treatment of this population.",

In New Jersey, African Americans, Hispanics, and those of low income have the highest rates of SSB consumption. This study evaluates the impact of NJ Sugarfreed, a campaign designed to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption across New Jersey. From 12/1/17-9/30/18, we used a collective impact model to create targeted statewide campaigns that reduce SSB consumption among New Jersey residents, with an emphasis on African American and Hispanic low-income mothers/caregivers who are often gatekeepers to children's SSB consumption. Passaic County, New Jersey received a higher dose intervention. Messages were disseminated through social media, partner organizations, and community partnerships. Campaign impact was examined through evaluation surveys and analysis of beverage sales. Baseline and follow-up surveys (n = 800 baseline; n = 782 follow-up) showed positive trends toward decreased soda consumption and increased knowledge about SSBs. Passaic respondents showed a 5% decrease in those who consume 1+ soda per day, compared to a 1% decrease among New Jersey respondents. Analysis of overall SSB beverage sales showed the most pronounced decreases in Passaic (7% decrease) compared to New Jersey (6%). By drawing upon best practices in message development and the use of various platforms for dissemination, combined with community-based participation, we have provided more evidence to support the use of a collective impact model as a way of reducing unhealthy behaviors that impact health disparities.",

We investigated the effects of SSBs commonly consumed by adolescents and their relationships to glucose metabolism and fatty liver. METHODS: We treated 7-week old male C57BL/6 mice with water (control) or one of three different SSBs, carbonated soda (Coca-Cola), sweetened milk coffee (Maxwell), or chocolate-added cocoa (Choco-Latte), for 13 weeks (n=10 in each group). Half of the animals were fed a regular chow diet and the other half a high-fat diet (40% fat). Body composition and biochemical variables were investigated at the end of treatment. Histology of the liver and adipose tissue, as well as molecular signaling related to glucose and lipid metabolism, were also evaluated. RESULTS: During the 13-week treatment, mice treated with chocolate-added cocoa or sweetened milk coffee showed significantly greater increases in body weight compared with controls, especially when fed a high-fat diet. Fasting glucose level was higher in the three SSB-treated groups compared with the control group. Lipid droplets in the liver, fat cell size, and number of CD68-positive cells in adipose tissue were greater in the SSB-treated groups than in the control group. SSB treatments increased the expression of genes related to inflammatory processes in the liver and adipose tissue. Phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase in muscle was significantly reduced in SSB-treated groups. CONCLUSION: Daily consumption of SSBs over 3 months lead to metabolic impairment and weight gain and may contribute to development of metabolic diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Restricting price promotions on unhealthy foods and beverages has been identified by governments as a promising approach for improving population diets. Using a limited societal perspective, this study assessed the potential cost-effectiveness of mandatory restrictions on price promotions for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in Australia. METHODS: Australian dietary consumption data, together with UK data on the SSB sales uplift associated with price promotions, were used to estimate reductions in SSB purchases and consequent changes in body mass index following the intervention. A multi-state, multiple-cohort Markov model was used to estimate the obesity-related health and cost impacts over the lifetime of the 2010 Australian population. Costs included passing legislation, assisting retailer implementation, and compliance monitoring. RESULTS: The intervention was estimated to result in a mean change in daily energy intake of -12.52 kJ (95% Uncertainty Interval, UI: -15.91 to -9.58) per person, which translated to a mean body weight change of -0.11 kg (95%UI: -0.14 to -0.08) per person. Total Health Adjusted Life Years gained were estimated at 34,260 (95%UI: 24,922-45,504). Estimated costs were AUD17.0 million, with estimated healthcare cost savings of AUD376.0 million. The intervention was considered dominant (cost-saving and health promoting). The intervention remained cost-effective if retailers reduced average non-discounted SSB prices in response to the intervention by less than 5.36%. CONCLUSIONS: Restricting price promotions on SSBs is likely to be highly cost-effective, although its impact would depend on how industry and shoppers respond. Although Australian data are used, these results are likely to be transferable and highly relevant to the UK context. Policies for restricting price promotions should be considered as part of a comprehensive obesity prevention strategy.",

On 28 March 2017, Catalonia enacted a law levying an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages for public health reasons. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the tax on the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in Catalonia (Spain). METHODS: Before-and-after study to assess changes in the prevalence of consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among 1929 persons aged 12 to 40 years residing in low-income neighbourhoods of Barcelona (intervention) and Madrid (control). Beverage consumption frequency was ascertained via a validated questionnaire administered during the month prior to the tax's introduction (May 2017) and again at 1 year after it had come into force. The effect of the tax was obtained using Poisson regression models with robust variance weighted using propensity scores. RESULTS: While the prevalence of regular consumers of taxed beverages fell by 39% in Barcelona as compared to Madrid, the prevalence of consumers of untaxed beverages remained stable. The main reason cited by more than two-thirds of those surveyed for reducing their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was the increase in price, followed by a heightened awareness of their health effects. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the Catalonian excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages was followed by a reduction in the prevalence of regular consumers of taxed beverages.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Reductions in sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake can improve health, but are difficult for individuals to achieve on their own. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether a workplace SSB sales ban was associated with SSB intake and cardiometabolic health among employees and whether a brief motivational intervention provides added benefits to the sales ban. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This before-after study and additional randomized trial conducted from July 28, 2015, to October 16, 2016, at a Northern California university and hospital assessed SSB intake, anthropometrics, and cardiometabolic biomarkers among 214 full-time English-speaking employees who were frequent SSB consumers (≥360 mL [≥12 fl oz] per day) before and 10 months after implementation of an SSB sales ban in a large workplace, with half the employees randomized to receive a brief motivational intervention targeting SSB reduction. INTERVENTIONS: The employer stopped selling SSBs in all workplace venues, and half the sample was randomized to receive a brief motivational intervention and the other half was a control group that did not receive the intervention. This intervention was modeled on standard brief motivational interventions for alcohol used in the workplace that promote health knowledge and goal setting. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included changes in SSB intake, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and measures of abdominal adiposity. The primary associations tested were the correlation between changes in SSB intake and changes in HOMA-IR. RESULTS: Among the 214 study participants, 124 (57.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 41.2 (11.0) years and a baseline mean (SD) body mass index of 29.4 (6.5). They reported a mean daily intake of 1050 mL (35 fl oz) of SSBs at baseline and 540 mL (18 fl oz) at follow-up-a 510-mL (17-fl oz) (48.6%) decrease (P < .001). Reductions in SSB intake correlated with improvements in HOMA-IR (r = 0.16; P = .03). Those not randomized to receive the brief intervention reduced their SSB intake by a mean (SD) of 246.0 (84.0) mL (8.2 [2.8] fl oz), while those also receiving the brief intervention reduced SSB intake by 762.0 (84.0) mL (25.4 [2.8] fl oz). From baseline to follow-up, there were significant reductions in mean (SE) waist circumference (2.1 [2.8] cm; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings suggest that the workplace sales ban was associated with a reduction in SSB intake and a significant reduction in waist circumference among employees within 10 months. The randomized clinical trial portion of this study found that targeting those at high risk with a brief motivational intervention led to additional improvements. Workplace sales bans may offer a promising new private-sector strategy for reducing the health harms of SSB intake. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02585336.",

DESIGN: Cross-sectional population-based survey. Respondents were recruited using a random digit dialling procedure (landline telephone) and a random selection of telephone numbers (mobile telephone). Sampling quotas were applied for age, and the sample was stratified according to administrative regions. SETTING: The province of Québec, Canada. SUBJECTS: One thousand adults aged between 18 and 64 years and able to answer the survey questionnaire in French or English. RESULTS: Support was observed for a number of public health interventions, but the more intrusive approaches were less supported. Support for taxation as well as for sale and access restriction was positively associated with the perceived relevance of the government intervention, perceived effectiveness, and perceived associations between SSB consumption and chronic diseases. Believing that SSB consumption is a personal choice and daily consumption were generally negatively associated with strong support and positively associated with strong opposition. Sparse associations between sociodemographic and socio-economic characteristics were observed, with the exception of sex and age: women were generally more likely to support the examined public health strategies, while younger respondents were less likely to express support. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing perceived effectiveness and government responsibility for addressing the issue of SSB consumption could lead to increased support for SSB interventions. Increasing the belief that SSB consumption could be associated with chronic diseases would increase support, but SSB consumers and younger individuals are expected to be resistant.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), as a component of a comprehensive strategy, has emerged as an apparent effective intervention to counteract the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity. Insight into the political and public acceptability may help adoption and implementation in countries with governments that are considering an SSBs tax. Hence, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the existing qualitative and quantitative literature on political and public acceptability of an SSBs tax. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched until November 2018. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Qualitative studies were analyzed using a thematic synthesis. Quantitative studies were analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis for the pooling of proportions. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles reporting on forty studies were eligible for inclusion. Five themes derived from the thematic synthesis: (i) beliefs about effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, (ii) appropriateness, (iii) economic and socioeconomic benefit, (iv) policy adoption and implementation, and (v) public mistrust of the industry, government and public health experts. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that of the public 42% (95% CI = 0.38-0.47) supports an SSBs tax, 39% (0.29-0.50) supports an SSBs tax as a strategy to reduce obesity, and 66% (0.60-0.72) supports an SSBs tax if revenue is used for health initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: Beliefs about effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, appropriateness, economic and socioeconomic benefit, policy adoption and implementation, and public mistrust of the industry, government and public health experts have important implications for the political and public acceptability of an SSBs tax. We provide recommendations to increase acceptability and enhance successful adoption and implementation of an SSBs tax: (i) address inconsistencies between identified beliefs and scientific literature, (ii) use raised revenue for health initiatives, (iii) communicate transparently about the true purpose of the tax, and (iv) generate political priority for solutions to the challenges to implementation.",

The population sample included 15,179 adults (median age=34.0 years, interquartile range=25, range=15-98 years) who participated in the SANHANES-1. Results: Overall, the study participants consumed 33.9% none, 48.3% 1-3 times, 7.2% 4-6 times, and 10.6% every day soft drinks in the past week (or an equivalent of an average of 0.30 servings, SD=0.3, per day); 43.4% had consumed no sweetened fruit juice, 42.3% 1-3 times, 5.2% 4-6 times; and 9.1% daily sweetened fruit juice (or an equivalent of an average of 0.25 servings, SD=0.3, per day). The prevalence of daily SSB (soft drink and/or sweetened fruit juice) consumption was 16.0% (or an equivalent of an average of 0.54 servings, SD=0.5, per day). In the final logistic regression model, younger age, urban residence, perceived overweight, fruit consumption, fresh fruit juice consumption, and having had processed meat and fried food from street vendors were associated with SSB consumption. In addition, problem drinking and physical activity were associated with daily soft drink consumption, and higher sedentary time was associated with daily sweetened fruit juice consumption. Conclusions: The study found a high prevalence of daily SSB consumption and identified several socio-behavioral factors that can be targeted in public health intervention programs."

      "abstract": "The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is disproportionately high in Appalachia, including among adolescents whose intake is more than double the national average and more than four times the recommended daily amount. Unfortunately, there is insufficient evidence for effective strategies targeting SSB behaviors among Appalachian youth in real-world settings, including rural schools. Kids SIPsmartER is a 6-month, school-based, behavior and health literacy program aimed at improving SSB behaviors among middle school students. The program also integrates a two-way short message service (SMS) strategy to engage caregivers in SSB role modeling and supporting home SSB environment changes. Kids SIPsmartER is grounded by the Theory of Planned Behavior and health literacy, media literacy, numeracy, and public health literacy concepts. Guided by the RE-AIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance), this type 1 hybrid design and cluster randomized controlled trial targets 12 Appalachian middle schools in southwest Virginia. The primary aim evaluates changes in SSB behaviors at 7-months among 7th grade students at schools receiving Kids SIPsmartER, as compared to control schools. Secondary outcomes include other changes in students (e.g., BMI, quality of life, theory-related variables) and caregivers (e.g., SSB behaviors, home SSB environment), and 19-month maintenance of these outcomes. Reach is assessed, along with mixed-methods strategies (e.g., interviews, surveys, observation) to determine how teachers implement Kids SIPsmartER and the potential for institutionalization within schools. This paper discusses the rationale for implementing and evaluating a type 1 hybrid design and multi-level intervention addressing pervasive SSB behaviors in Appalachia.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Frequent consumption of excess amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is a risk factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dental caries. Environmental interventions, i.e. interventions that alter the physical or social environment in which individuals make beverage choices, have been advocated as a means to reduce the consumption of SSB. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of environmental interventions (excluding taxation) on the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened milk, diet-related anthropometric measures and health outcomes, and on any reported unintended consequences or adverse outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 11 general, specialist and regional databases from inception to 24 January 2018. We also searched trial registers, reference lists and citations, scanned websites of relevant organisations, and contacted study authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies on interventions implemented at an environmental level, reporting effects on direct or indirect measures of SSB intake, diet-related anthropometric measures and health outcomes, or any reported adverse outcome. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) and interrupted-time-series (ITS) studies, implemented in real-world settings with a combined length of intervention and follow-up of at least 12 weeks and at least 20 individuals in each of the intervention and control groups. We excluded studies in which participants were administered SSB as part of clinical trials, and multicomponent interventions which did not report SSB-specific outcome data. We excluded studies on the taxation of SSB, as these are the subject of a separate Cochrane Review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies. We classified interventions according to the NOURISHING framework, and synthesised results narratively and conducted meta-analyses for two outcomes relating to two intervention types. We assessed our confidence in the certainty of effect estimates with the GRADE framework as very low, low, moderate or high, and presented 'Summary of findings' tables. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 14,488 unique records, and assessed 1030 in full text for eligibility. We found 58 studies meeting our inclusion criteria, including 22 RCTs, 3 NRCTs, 14 CBA studies, and 19 ITS studies, with a total of 1,180,096 participants. The median length of follow-up was 10 months. The studies included children, teenagers and adults, and were implemented in a variety of settings, including schools, retailing and food service establishments. We judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain, and most studies used non-randomised designs. The studies examine a broad range of interventions, and we present results for these separately.Labelling interventions (8 studies): We found moderate-certainty evidence that traffic-light labelling is associated with decreasing sales of SSBs, and low-certainty evidence that nutritional rating score labelling is associated with decreasing sales of SSBs. For menu-board calorie labelling reported effects on SSB sales varied.Nutrition standards in public institutions (16 studies): We found low-certainty evidence that reduced availability of SSBs in schools is associated with decreased SSB consumption. We found very low-certainty evidence that improved availability of drinking water in schools and school fruit programmes are associated with decreased SSB consumption. Reported associations between improved availability of drinking water in schools and student body weight varied.Economic tools (7 studies): We found moderate-certainty evidence that price increases on SSBs are associated with decreasing SSB sales. For price discounts on low-calorie beverages reported effects on SSB sales varied.Whole food supply interventions (3 studies): Reported associations between voluntary industry initiatives to improve the whole food supply and SSB sales varied.Retail and food service interventions (7 studies): We found low-certainty evidence that healthier default beverages in children's menus in chain restaurants are associated with decreasing SSB sales, and moderate-certainty evidence that in-store promotion of healthier beverages in supermarkets is associated with decreasing SSB sales. We found very low-certainty evidence that urban planning restrictions on new fast-food restaurants and restrictions on the number of stores selling SSBs in remote communities are associated with decreasing SSB sales. Reported associations between promotion of healthier beverages in vending machines and SSB intake or sales varied.Intersectoral approaches (8 studies): We found moderate-certainty evidence that government food benefit programmes with restrictions on purchasing SSBs are associated with decreased SSB intake. For unrestricted food benefit programmes reported effects varied. We found moderate-certainty evidence that multicomponent community campaigns focused on SSBs are associated with decreasing SSB sales. Reported associations between trade and investment liberalisation and SSB sales varied.Home-based interventions (7 studies): We found moderate-certainty evidence that improved availability of low-calorie beverages in the home environment is associated with decreased SSB intake, and high-certainty evidence that it is associated with decreased body weight among adolescents with overweight or obesity and a high baseline consumption of SSBs.Adverse outcomes reported by studies, which may occur in some circumstances, included negative effects on revenue, compensatory SSB consumption outside school when the availability of SSBs in schools is reduced, reduced milk intake, stakeholder discontent, and increased total energy content of grocery purchases with price discounts on low-calorie beverages, among others. The certainty of evidence on adverse outcomes was low to very low for most outcomes.We analysed interventions targeting sugar-sweetened milk separately, and found low- to moderate-certainty evidence that emoticon labelling and small prizes for the selection of healthier beverages in elementary school cafeterias are associated with decreased consumption of sugar-sweetened milk. We found low-certainty evidence that improved placement of plain milk in school cafeterias is not associated with decreasing sugar-sweetened milk consumption. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence included in this review indicates that effective, scalable interventions addressing SSB consumption at a population level exist. Implementation should be accompanied by high-quality evaluations using appropriate study designs, with a particular focus on the long-term effects of approaches suitable for large-scale implementation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: While taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have frequently been proposed to reduce non-communicable diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes, relatively little is known about the caries-related impacts of SSB taxation. We assessed the effect of a 20% ad valorem tax on SSBs on dental caries and related treatment costs, specifically taking into account that consumers may switch from SSBs to other (non-taxed) sugar-containing drinks. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A tooth-level Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost and effects of SSB taxation. Tax-related changes in sugar consumption were calculated using available evidence on SSBs price and cross-price elasticities, thereby taking changes in drinks consumption behaviors into account. The model was used to establish lifetime disease-free tooth years, caries lesions prevented, caries-related treatment costs avoided, tax revenues, and administrative costs (reference case: the Netherlands). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to address uncertainties. RESULTS: A 20% SSB taxation would result in an average of 2.13 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2.12-2.13) caries-free tooth years per person and, on population level, prevention of 1,030,163 (95% UI 1,027,903-1,032,423) caries lesions. The intervention was found to save an aggregate total of € 159.01 (95% UI 158.67-159.35) million in terms of dental care expenditures. The estimated lifetime tax revenues (€3.49billion) were larger than the administrative costs for taxation (€37.3 million). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that SSB taxation may substantially improve oral health and reduce the caries-related economic burden. Benefits would be the greatest for younger age groups.",

      "abstract": "It is unclear whether sugar sweetened beverages bypass regulatory controls of food intake (FI) in boys. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of isovolumetric preloads (350 mL) of a fruit-flavoured drink (154 kcal), cola (158 kcal), 1% M.F. chocolate milk (224 kcal), and water (0 kcal) on subjective appetite and FI in boys aged 9⁻14 years. On four separate mornings, boys consumed one of the preloads in a random order; subjective appetite was measured at 15 min intervals, and FI was measured via an ad libitum pizza lunch at 60 min post-beverage consumption. In the 32 boys (age: 11.8 ± 0.3 years), FI was reduced (p < 0.001) after cola (940 ± 46 kcal) and chocolate milk (878 ± 41 kcal) compared with the water control (1048 ± 35 kcal) and after chocolate milk compared to the fruit drink (1005 ± 44 kcal). Cumulative FI after the fruit drink was greater than the water control (1159 ± 44 vs. 1048 ± 35 kcal; p = 0.03). Average appetite was not affected by the treatment, but the cola treatment resulted in greater fullness (p = 0.04) and lower prospective food consumption (p = 0.004) compared with the fruit drink. In conclusion, chocolate milk and cola suppressed next-meal FI at 60 min, while fruit drink increased cumulative FI (beverage + next meal) over 60 min in boys. Results from this study suggest that beverage composition is an important determinant of FI suppression in boys.",

      "abstract": "SIPsmartER is a theory-based, 6-month, multi-component health literacy intervention shown to improve sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) behaviors among adults in rural, southwest Virginia. The objective of this pilot trial was to understand the reach and effectiveness of SIPsmartER when delivered by existing staff in public health practice settings. This pre-post research design was conducted in partnership with four medically underserved southwest Virginia Department of Health (VDH) districts. Validated measures and standardized data collection techniques were used. Analyses included descriptive statistics and multilevel mixed-effects linear regressions models. Of 928 individuals screened, 586 (63%) were eligible and 117 (20% of eligible) enrolled in SIPsmartER (79% retained). The sample was majority female (71%) and white (94%) and had ≤high school education (59%) and an annual income of approximately $12,500. Relative to the county population, the enrolled study sample was representative for age and race, yet underrepresented for men and overrepresented for low income and low educational attainment. Significant improvements from baseline to 6 months were observed for the primary SSB outcome (-403 [confidence interval [CI] = -528, -278] SSB kcals/day) (p < .001). SSB-related attitudes, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intentions, and media literacy also significantly improved (all p < .05). SIPsmartER appears to be promising for VDH and potentially other health departments in medically underserved areas. When compared to the previous effectiveness trial, existing VDH staff achieved similar reach and effectiveness for some, but not all, outcomes. Future work is needed on methods to support health departments in developing strategies to reach new participants and to integrate SIPsmartER into sustained practice.",

Young people consume the largest amounts of SSBs and have experienced the greatest relative gains in obesity in the past several decades. There is evidence of addictive properties of both caffeine and sugar, the primary ingredients in SSBs, but little research into such properties of SSBs in naturally occurring consumption patterns. Thus, in this exploratory study, we sought to examine potentially addictive properties of SSBs during a 3-day SSB cessation intervention in overweight and obese adolescents who typically consume ≥3 SSBs daily. Participants (n = 25) were aged 13-18 years, mostly female (72%), and African American (56%) or Hispanic (16%) with a BMI≥95th percenttile (76%). Withdrawal symptoms and SSB craving were assessed approximately 1-week apart, during both regular SSB consumption and a 3-day period of SSB cessation in which participants were instructed to drink only plain milk and water. During SSB cessation, adolescents reported increased SSB cravings and headache and decreased motivation, contentment, ability to concentrate, and overall well-being (uncorrected Ps < 0.05). After controlling the false discovery rate, changes in motivation, craving, and well-being remained significant (corrected Ps < 0.05). Using 24-hr recalls and drink journals, participants reported lower total daily consumption of sugar (-80 g) and added sugar (-16 g) (Ps < 0.001) during cessation. This study provides preliminary evidence of withdrawal symptoms and increased SSB cravings during cessation in a diverse population of overweight or obese adolescents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fiscal policies to fight obesity such as taxation of unhealthy foods or sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have gained considerable attention in recent years. Many studies modelling the impact of various magnitudes of taxes on SSB purchasing and their potential effects on various health outcomes have been published; however, legislation and implementation of such taxes have encountered many obstacles in the countries that have implemented them to date. We investigated the perceptions and views of key opinion leaders, policy makers and various other Israeli stakeholders on taxation of SSBs and unhealthy snacks. We also evaluated the challenges and barriers that may be expected for initiating such a policy. METHODS: A qualitative study based on 39 in-depth interviews with Israeli stakeholders in the fields of health, nutrition, economics, public advocacy and policymaking. RESULTS: All stakeholders viewed obesity as a combined societal and personal issue that should be under government responsibility. Only stakeholders from economic sectors thought that taxation of SSBs and unhealthy snacks would reduce their consumption, while the prevailing notion among non-economists was that such a tax would not be acceptable because the higher price would not decrease consumption. Concerns were raised that the tax would mostly affect individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Some of the stakeholders indicated that they would support such a tax only if its revenue would be directed to specific causes such as health-promoting plans. Potential barriers to taxation include: opposition of various sectors, technical and bureaucratic obstacles impeding tax implementation, difficulties in defining which products to tax, and opposition of the treasury to earmark tax revenue for health education. CONCLUSIONS: Taxation should be a part of a multipronged strategy rather than a sole measure for fighting obesity. Dedicating tax revenues to specific predefined causes should be considered, particularly towards health promotion activities, obesity treatment and prevention, education, and subsidies of healthy food.",

METHODS: Data was collected from Chinese Nutrition and Health Surveillance: 2010-2012. Multi-stage stratified random cluster and probability proportionate sampling method was used, and 45 203 respondents aged 18 and over from 150 sites of 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities were involved in the analysis. The consumption rate of sugar-sweetened beverages, distribution of the classification of the consumption frequency and percentage of variety beverages consumption frequency were calculated. RESULTS: There were 50. 1% of Chinese adults in2010-2012 consuming sugar-sweetened beverages, men and women were 49. 2% and 50. 8%, for age groups of 18-44, 45-59 and 60 and over, the consumption rates were65. 4% %, 47. 0% % 36. 3%, respectively. The prevalence in cities was 49. 0% and in counties was 51. 3%. The rate of consuming 1 time/week and over was 15. 3% and consuming 1 time/day was 1. 3%. As the economical level decreased, the two rates decreased. Carbonated beverages had the highest consumption frequency( 39. 8%), and the lactic acid beverages had the lowest( 10. 8%). Consumption of carbonated beverages in men( 44. 8%) was higher than that in women( 35. 3%), while for the fruit and vegetable juice, lactic acid beverages, disposable milk beverages and coffee, the consumption in women were higher than that in men. As the economical level decreased, consumption of carbonated and disposable milk beverages were increasing, and lactic acid beverages and coffee were decreasing significantly. CONCLUSION: The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among adults in 2010-2012 was relatively high. The targeted nutrition health education and intervention was needed and implemented to decrease the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the LiveLighter 'Sugary Drinks' campaign impact on awareness, knowledge and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption. DESIGN: Cohort study with population surveys undertaken in intervention and comparison states at baseline (n=900 each), with 78% retention at follow-up (intervention: n=673; comparison: n=730). Analyses tested interactions by state (intervention, comparison) and time (baseline, follow-up). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 25-49 years residing in the Australian states of Victoria and South Australia. INTERVENTION: The 6-week mass media campaign ran in Victoria in October/November 2015. It focused on the contribution of SSBs to the development of visceral 'toxic fat', graphically depicted around vital organs, and ultimately serious disease. Paid television advertising was complemented by radio, cinema, online and social media advertising, and stakeholder and community engagement. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported consumption of SSBs, artificially sweetened drinks and water. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Campaign recall and recognition; knowledge of the health effects of overweight and SSB consumption; perceived impact of SSB consumption on body weight and of reduced consumption on health. RESULTS: A significant reduction in frequent SSB consumption was observed in the intervention state (intervention: 31% compared with 22%, comparison: 30% compared with 29%; interaction p<0.01). This was accompanied by evidence of increased water consumption (intervention: 66% compared with 73%; comparison: 68% compared with 67%; interaction p=0.09) among overweight/obese SSB consumers. This group also showed increased knowledge of the health effects of SSB consumption (intervention: 60% compared with 71%, comparison: 63% compared with 59%; interaction p<0.05) and some evidence of increased prevalence of self-referent thoughts about SSB's relationship to weight gain (intervention: 39% compared with 45%, comparison: 43% compared with 38%; interaction p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide evidence of reduced SSB consumption among adults in the target age range following the LiveLighter campaign. This is notable in a context where public health campaigns occur against a backdrop of heavy commercial product advertising promoting increased SSB consumption.",

      "abstract": "While sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has declined in the last 15 years, consumption of SSBs is still high among children and adolescents. This research synthesis updates a prior review on this topic and examines the evidence regarding the various health impacts of SSBs on children's health (overweight/obesity, insulin resistance, dental caries, and caffeine-related effects). We searched PubMed, CAB Abstracts and PAIS International to identify cross-sectional, longitudinal and intervention studies examining the health impacts of SSBs in children published after January 1, 2007. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. Overall, most studies found consistent evidence for the negative impact of SSBs on children's health, with the strongest support for overweight/obesity risk and dental caries, and emerging evidence for insulin resistance and caffeine-related effects. The majority of evidence was cross-sectional highlighting the need for more longitudinal and intervention studies to address this research question. There is substantial evidence that SSBs increase the risk of overweight/obesity and dental caries and developing evidence for the negative impact of SSBs on insulin resistance and caffeine-related effects. The vast majority of literature supports the idea that a reduction in SSB consumption would improve children's health."

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among primary and junior high school students selected from 32 primary schools and 16 junior high schools using a multi-stage random sampling method, with a total number of 10,091 participants involved. The mean age of Grade 4 is 9.04 ± 0.38, while the mean age of Grade 7 is 12.03 ± 0.41. Blood pressure was measured and SSBs consumption was reported using a validated questionnaire. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 4.5% among the participants. After adjustment for school, parental education, physical activity, diet intake including meat and snacks, participants who had an experience of SSBs intake were at a higher risk of developing hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15, 1.70) compared with those who had no experience of SSBs intake. A significant association between the consumption of SSBs and hypertension was observed among the students who were at a healthy weight (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.20, 2.65), as well as who were overweight or obese (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.61). SSBs may play a contributing role in developing childhood hypertension in this population in China, which is of important implications for future population-based childhood hypertension intervention in China and other countries.",

Numerous behavioral interventions aimed at reducing the intake of SSBs among children have been reported, yet evidence of their effectiveness is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explored the effectiveness of educational and behavioral interventions to reduce SSB intake and to influence health outcomes among children aged 4 to 16 years. DATA SOURCES: Seven databases were searched for randomized controlled trials published prior to September 2016. Studies identified were screened for eligibility. STUDY SELECTION: Trials were included in the review if they met the PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study design) criteria for inclusion of studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 2 reviewers following Cochrane guidelines and using Review Manager software. RESULTS: Of the 16 trials included, 12 were school based and 4 were community or home based. Only 3 trials provided data that could be pooled into a meta-analysis for evaluating change in SSB intake. Subgroup analyses showed a trend toward a significant reduction in SSB intake in participants in school-based interventions compared with control groups. Change in body mass index z scores was not statistically significant between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of evidence from included trials was considered moderate, and the effectiveness of educational and behavioral interventions in reducing SSB intake was modest.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Partly inconsistent findings from previous reviews have fueled discussions on the impact of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on obesity development. The aim was to systematically review the recent evidence in children and adults. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library for the period January 2013 to October 2015. A systematic review of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relating SSBs to weight measures was conducted. RESULTS: 30 publications met the inclusion criteria. Prospective cohort studies (96%; n = 26) showed a positive association between consumption of SSBs and weight/BMI in adults and children (n = 242,352), and only one cohort study in children showed no association. Findings from three RCTs in children demonstrated that SSB consumption had an effect on BMI/BMI z-score. The one RCT in adults showed no significant effect of the intervention. 63% of the studies were of good, 30% of medium quality, and none was funded by industry. CONCLUSION: Recent evidence suggests that SSB consumption is positively associated with or has an effect on obesity indices in children and adults. By combining the already published evidence with the new one, we conclude that public health policies should aim to reduce the consumption of SSBs and encourage healthy alternatives such as water.",

This study modelled the potential cost-effectiveness of: a package size cap on single-serve sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) &gt;375 mL ( package size cap ), and product reformulation to reduce energy content of packaged SSBs ( energy reduction ). The cost-effectiveness of each intervention was modelled for the 2010 Australia population using a multi-state life table Markov model with a lifetime time horizon. Long-term health outcomes were modelled from calculated changes in body mass index to their impact on Health-Adjusted Life Years (HALYs). Intervention costs were estimated from a limited societal perspective. Cost and health outcomes were discounted at 3%. Total intervention costs estimated in AUD 2010 were AUD 210 million. Both interventions resulted in reduced mean body weight ( package size cap : 0.12 kg; energy reduction : 0.23 kg); and HALYs gained ( package size cap : 73,883; energy reduction : 144,621). Cost offsets were estimated at AUD 750.8 million ( package size cap ) and AUD 1.4 billion ( energy reduction ). Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that both interventions were \"dominant\", and likely to result in long term cost savings and health benefits. A package size cap and kJ reduction of SSBs are likely to offer excellent \"value for money\" as obesity prevention measures in Australia.",

      "abstract": "Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption increases obesity risk and is linked to adverse health consequences. Large packages increase food consumption, but most evidence comes from studies comparing larger with standard packages, resulting in uncertainty regarding the impact of smaller packages. There is also little research on beverages. This qualitative study explores the experiences of consuming cola from smaller compared with larger bottles, to inform intervention strategies. Sixteen households in Cambridge, England, participating in a feasibility study assessing the impact of bottle size on in-home SSB consumption, received a set amount of cola each week for four weeks in one of four bottle sizes: 1500 ml, 1000 ml, 500 ml, or 250 ml, in random order. At the study end, household representatives were interviewed about their experiences of using each bottle, including perceptions of i) consumption level; ii) consumption-related behaviours; and iii) factors affecting consumption. Interviews were semi-structured and data analysed using the Framework approach. The present analysis focuses specifically on experiences relating to use of the smaller bottles. The smallest bottles were described as increasing drinking occasion frequency and encouraging consumption of numerous bottles in succession. Factors described as facilitating their consumption were: i) convenience and portability; ii) greater numbers of bottles available, which hindered consumption monitoring and control; iii) perceived insufficient quantity per bottle; and iv) positive attitudes. In a minority of cases the smallest bottles were perceived to have reduced consumption, but this was related to practical issues with the bottles that resulted in dislike. The perception of greater consumption and qualitative reports of drinking habits associated with the smallest bottles raise the possibility that the 'portion size effect' has a lower threshold, beyond which smaller portions and packages may increase consumption. This reinforces the need for empirical evidence to assess the in-home impact of smaller bottles on SSB consumption.",

This study determined attitudes, behaviors, future intentions, and perceived barriers of pediatric dentists regarding efforts to prevent childhood obesity and reduce children's consumption of SSBs. METHODS: The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry conducted an online electronic survey with a convenience sample of approximately 7,450 pediatric dentists and pediatric dental residents during spring 2016. RESULTS: Over 17 percent of pediatric dentists offer childhood obesity interventions. Of those not providing interventions, 67 percent were interested in offering obesity-prevention services. Nearly 94 percent of pediatric dentists offer information or other interventions on consumption of SSBs. Statistically significant barriers to providing healthy weight interventions were fear of offending parents, appearing judgmental, or creating parent dissatisfaction and a lack of parental acceptance of guidance about weight management from a dentist. Significant barriers to SSB interventions were sufficient time and health professional education. CONCLUSIONS: More pediatric dentists stated they offer childhood obesity interventions than in previous surveys reporting 6 percent, but respondents suggested that a child's weight is seen as a medical rather than dental issue. Most pediatric dentists provide interventions related to consumption of SSBs, perceiving the issue as integral to their care of children.",

Intervention studies have shown that SSB overconsumption increases intra-abdominal obesity and ectopic lipid deposition in the liver, and also exacerbates cardiometabolic risk. Similar to the prevalence of obesity and T2D, national surveys of food consumption have shown that chronic overconsumption of SSBs is skyrocketing in many parts of the world, yet with marked heterogeneity across countries. SSB overconsumption is also particularly worrisome among children and adolescents. Although the relationships between SSB overconsumption and obesity, T2D, and CVD are rather consistent in epidemiological studies, it has also been shown that SSB overconsumption is part of an overall poor dietary pattern and is particularly prevalent among subgroups of the population with low socioeconomic status, thereby questioning the major focus on SSBs to target/prevent cardiometabolic diseases. Public health initiatives aimed specifically at decreasing SSB overconsumption will most likely be successful in influencing SSB consumption per se. However, comprehensive strategies targeting poor dietary patterns and aiming at improving global dietary quality are likely to have much more impact in addressing the unprecedented public health challenges that we are currently facing.",

This study was performed to assess the possible association between SSBs consumption and obesity in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. METHODS: T2DM adults with no insulin treatment entered the study. Abdominal obesity and general adiposity were determined using waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI), respectively. SSBs intake was extracted from a validated food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean SSBs intake was 0.6 serving/d (145.6mL/d). There was no considerable association between SSBs intake and gender. About 46% of patients consumed at least one serving of SSBs per week. SSBs consumption was correlated neither to WC nor to BMI. After adjustment for confounding factors, abdominal obesity was associated with drinking SSBs ≥1 serving/week (OR=4.93, 95% CI: 1.35-18.03), and SSB ≥3 serving/week (OR=5.07, 95% CI: 1.22-21.15) compared to those consumed <1 serving/week. This association was not found for general obesity (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.60-1.23). Ex-smokers had higher SSBs intake compared to those never smoked (OR=3.94, 95% CI=1.06-14.71). Energy intake and macronutrients were similar in both SSBs sub-groups. Mean daily energy supplied by SSBs was 120kcal in participants having ≥1 serving of SSBs/week and 2.7kcal in <1 serving SSBs/week (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.09-1.20). Lower SSBs drinkers had 17% higher fiber intake (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.73-0.96). CONCLUSION: SSBs intake might increase abdominal obesity in diabetic population and therefore should be considered in diabetes control procedure.",

We evaluated the campaign with pre- and post-telephone surveys of adults aged 18 to 45 years in the intervention area and by examining changes in beverage sales in the intervention and a matched comparison area in western Virginia. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of postcampaign respondents recalled seeing a campaign advertisement. After the campaign, 53% of respondents believed SSBs were a cause of heart disease, and respondents were more likely postcampaign to consider SSBs a \"big cause of diabetes\" (75% vs 60%; P < .001). Compared with 12 months before, after the start of the campaign, SSB sales decreased 3.4%, including a 4.1% decrease in soda sales in the intervention area relative to the comparison area (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: This brief media campaign on SSBs was followed by intended changes in beliefs and consumption. Public Health Implications. Additional media campaigns on SSBs should be attempted and evaluated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumption of sugars-sweetened beverages (SSB) increases energy intake and the risk of obesity. Large packages increase consumption of food, implying that smaller bottle sizes may help curb SSB consumption, but there is a lack of relevant evidence relating to these products. This study explores the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of different bottle sizes on SSB consumption at home. METHODS: Households in Cambridge, England, which purchased at least 2 l of regular cola drinks per week, received a set amount of cola each week for four weeks, in bottles of one of four sizes (1500 ml, 1000 ml, 500 ml, or 250 ml) in random order. The total volume received consisted of a modest excess of households' typical weekly purchasing, but was further increased for half the study households to avoid ceiling effects. Consumption was measured by recording the number of empty bottles at the end of each week. Eligible households were invited to complete a run-in period to assess levels of active participation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 111 eligible households with an interest in the study completed the run-in period. The study procedures proved feasible. The target for recruitment (n = 16 households) was exceeded. Measuring consumption was feasible: over three quarters (n = 30/37) of households returned all bottles on the majority (n = 88/101) of the study weeks completed across households. The validity of this measure was compromised by guests from outside the household who drank the study cola (n = 18/37 households on 48/101 study weeks) and consumption of the study cola outside the home. Supplying enhanced volumes of cola to nine households was associated with higher consumption (11,592 ml vs 7869 ml). The intervention and study procedures were considered acceptable. Thirteen households correctly identified the study aims. CONCLUSION: The findings support the feasibility and acceptability of running a randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of presenting a fixed volume of SSB in different bottle sizes on in-home consumption. However, methods that avoid consumption being influenced by the amount of cola supplied weekly by the study and that capture out of home consumption are needed before conducting a randomised controlled trial.

We, therefore, assessed whether replacing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) with artificially-sweetened beverages (ASB) in the diet of overweight and obese subjects would decrease these parameters. METHODS: Twenty-six participants of the REDUCS study, which assessed the effects of replacing SSB by ASB over 12 weeks on intra-hepatocellular lipid concentration, were included in this sub-analysis. All were studied after a four-week run-in period during which they consumed their usual diet and SSBs, and after a 12-week intervention in which they were randomly assigned to replace their SSBs with ASBs (ASB arm) or to continue their usual diet and SSBs (control arm, CTRL). At the end of run-in (week 4) and again at the end of intervention (week 16), they took part in an 8.5 h metabolic investigation during which their plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, lactate, triglyceride (TG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and uric acid concentrations were measured over a 30 min fasting period (-30-0 min), then every 2 h over 480 min. with ingestion of standard breakfast at time 0 min and a standard lunch at time 240 min. Breakfast and lunch were consumed together with a 3.3 dL SSB at week 4 and with either an ASB (ASB arm) or a SSB (CTRL arm) at week 16. After analyzing the whole group, a secondary analysis was performed on 14 subjects with hepatic steatosis (seven randomized to ASB, seven to CTRL) and 12 subjects without hepatic steatosis (six randomized to ASB and six to CTRL). RESULTS: Ingestion of meals increased plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, lactate, and TG concentrations and decreased NEFA concentrations, but with no significant difference of integrated postprandial responses between week 4 and week 16 in both ASB and CTRL, except for a slightly decreased glucagon response in ASB. There was, however, no significant postprandial increase in uric acid concentration in both arms. In the secondary analysis, replacing SSBs with ASBs did not significantly change postprandial TG and uric acid concentrations irrespective of the presence or not of hepatic steatosis, Conclusions: In overweight, high SSB consumers, replacing SSBs with ASBs during 12 weeks did not significantly alter post-prandial TG and uric acid concentration, in spite of the lower energy and fructose content of the meals. These effects were globally the same in subjects without and with hepatic steatosis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether functional sugars with low compared to high glycemic index (GI) have beneficial effects on arterial stiffness during a period of low-physical activity. In a controlled cross-over dietary intervention (55% CHO, 30% fat, 15% protein), 13 healthy men (age: 23.7 ± 2.2 years, body mass index: 23.6 ± 1.9 kg/m²) completed 2 × 1 week of low physical activity following 1 week of normal physical activity (2363 ± 900 vs. 11,375 ± 3124 steps/day). During inactive phases participants consumed either low-GI (isomaltulose) or high-GI SSB (maltodextrin-sucrose), providing 20% of energy requirements. Postprandial vasodilatation (augmentation index, AIx), insulin sensitivity (IS) and Glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) responses were measured during a meal test before and after SSB-intervention. Compared to maltodextrin-sucrose-SSB, postprandial vasodilatation was prolonged (AIx after 120 min: 9.9% ± 4.3% vs. 11.4% ± 3.7%, p < 0.05) and GLP-1 secretion was higher with isomaltulose-SSB (total area under the GLP-1 curve (tAUCGLP)-1: 8.0 ± 4.4 vs. 5.4 ± 3.4 pM × 3 h; p < 0.05). One week of low-physical activity led to impaired IS that was attenuated with low-GI SSB consumption, but did not affect arterial stiffness (p > 0.05). Higher postprandial GLP-1 secretion after intake of low compared to high-GI beverages may contribute to improved postprandial vasodilatation. Although one week of low-physical activity led to marked impairment in IS, it had no effect on arterial stiffness in healthy men.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intake of free sugars in the population exceeds recommendations, with the largest source in the diet being sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). SSB consumption is linked to adverse health consequences and contributes to health inequalities, given greater consumption amongst the most deprived. One possible intervention is to reduce the available sizes of SSB packaging but there is an absence of evidence that this would reduce consumption. Based on evidence from studies targeting food consumption that people consume less when exposed to smaller package sizes, we hypothesise that presenting SSBs in smaller containers reduces consumption. We are planning a crossover randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of presenting a fixed volume of SSB in different bottle sizes on consumption at home. To reduce the uncertainties related to this trial, we propose a preliminary study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the recruitment, allocation, measurement, retention and intervention procedures. METHODS/DESIGN: Households which purchase at least 2 l of regular cola drinks per week and live in Cambridgeshire, UK will have a set amount of a cola SSB (based on their typical weekly purchasing of cola) delivered to their homes each week by the research team. This total amount of cola will be packaged into bottles of one of four sizes: (i) 1500 ml, (ii) 1000 ml, (iii) 500 ml or (iv) 250 ml. A crossover design will be used in which households will each receive all four of the week-long interventions (the four different bottle sizes) over time, randomised in their order of presentation. Approximately 100 eligible households will be approached to assess the proportion interested in actively participating in the study. Of those interested, 16 will be invited to continue participation. DISCUSSION: The findings will inform the procedures for a crossover randomised controlled trial assessing the impact of presenting a fixed volume of SSB in different bottle sizes on consumption at home. The findings from such a trial are expected to provide the best estimate to date of the effect of container size on beverage consumption and inform ongoing scientific and policy discussions about the effectiveness of this intervention at reducing population intake of free sugars in beverages.

      "abstract": "Caries increment is affected by sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption. Taxing SSBs could reduce sugar consumption and caries increment. The authors aimed to estimate the impact of a 20% SSB sales tax on caries increment and associated treatment costs (as well as the resulting tax revenue) in the context of Germany. A model-based approach was taken, estimating the effects for the German population aged 14 to 79 y over a 10-y period. Taxation was assumed to affect beverage-associated sugar consumption via empirical demand elasticities. Altered consumption affected caries increments and treatment costs, with cost estimates being calculated under the perspective of the statutory health insurance. National representative consumption and price data were used to estimate tax revenue. Microsimulations were performed to estimate health outcomes, costs, and revenue impact in different age, sex, and income groups. Implementing a 20% SSB sales tax reduced sugar consumption in nearly all male groups but in fewer female groups. The reduction was larger among younger than older individuals and among those with low income. Taxation reduced caries increment and treatment costs especially in younger (rather than older) individuals and those with low income. Over 10 y, mean (SD) net caries increments at the population level were 82.27 (1.15) million and 83.02 (1.08) million teeth at 20% and 0% SSB tax, respectively. These generated treatment costs of 2.64 (0.39) billion and 2.72 (0.35) billion euro, respectively. Additional tax revenue was 37.99 (3.41) billion euro over the 10 y. In conclusion and within the limitations of this study's perspective, database, and underlying assumptions, implementing a 20% sales tax on SSBs is likely to reduce caries increment, especially in young low-income males, thereby also reducing inequalities in the distribution of caries experience. Taxation would also reduce treatment costs. However, these reductions might be limited in the total population.",

In a between-subjects randomized manipulation of implementation intentions and Go/No-Go training to learn to inhibit sugary drink consumption, 168 adolescents reporting inhibitory control problems over sugary drinks and foods were recruited from high schools in southern California to participate. Analysis of covariance overall test of effects revealed no significant differences between the groups regarding calories consumed, calories from SSBs, grams of sugar consumed from drinks, or the number of unhealthy drinks chosen. However, subsequent contrasts revealed SSB implementation intentions significantly reduced SSB consumption following intervention while controlling for inhibitory control failure and general SSB consumption during observation in a lab setting that provided SSBs and healthy drinks, as well as healthy and unhealthy snacks. Specifically, during post-intervention observation, participants in the sugar-sweetened beverage implementation intentions (SSB-II) conditions consumed significantly fewer calories overall, fewer calories from drinks, and fewer grams of sugar. No effects were found for the drink-specific Go/No-Go training on SSB or calorie consumption. However, participants in SSB-II with an added SSB Go/No-Go training made fewer unhealthy drink choices than those in the other conditions. Implementation intentions may aid individuals with inhibitory (executive control) difficulties by intervening on pre-potent behavioral tendencies, like SSB consumption.",

Our aim was to test whether 355 and 600 ml of commercial sugar-sweetened soft drinks would acutely raise plasma uric acid. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Forty-one participants were randomised to a control group or an intervention group. The control group consumed 600 ml of fructose and 600 ml of glucose beverages. The soft drink group consumed 355 and 600 ml of beverages in random order. The control beverages were matched for fructose content with 600 ml of soft drink (26.7 g). Blood samples were collected at baseline, 30 and 60 min and analysed for plasma uric acid. RESULTS: Plasma uric acid concentrations were 13 (95% confidence interval: (CI): 3, 23) and 17 μmol/l (95% CI: 6, 28) higher 30 and 60 min after consumption of 600 ml of soft drink compared with the glucose control. The corresponding values for the fructose beverage were 22 (95% CI: 16, 29) and 23 μmol/l (95% CI: 14, 33). There was no significant difference in the increase in uric acid following the 600-ml soft drink compared with the fructose control at 30 min (6 μmol/l; 95% CI: -4, 15) or 60 min (5 μmol/l; 95% CI: -7, 17). There was no difference in the uric-acid-raising effect between the 355 and 600 ml volumes at 30 min (-1 μmol/l; 95% CI: -9, 6) or 60 min (-5 μmol/l; 95% CI: -10, 1). CONCLUSION: Small and transient increases in plasma uric acid are likely after consumption of sucrose-sweetened commercially available single-serve soft drinks in volumes as small as 355 ml.",

METHODS: We compared acceptability, in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA), of government interventions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Three nudge interventions were assessed: i. reducing portion Size, ii. changing the Shape of the drink containers, iii. changing their shelf Location; alongside two traditional interventions: iv. Taxation and v. Education. We also tested the hypothesis that describing interventions as working through non-conscious processes decreases their acceptability. Predictors of acceptability, including perceived intervention effectiveness, were also assessed. Participants (n = 1093 UK and n = 1082 USA) received a description of each of the five interventions which varied, by randomisation, in how the interventions were said to affect behaviour: (a) via conscious processes; (b) via non-conscious processes; or (c) no process stated. Acceptability was derived from responses to three items. RESULTS: Levels of acceptability for four of the five interventions did not differ significantly between the UK and US samples; reducing portion size was less accepted by the US sample. Within each country, Education was rated as most acceptable and Taxation the least, with the three nudge-type interventions rated between these. There was no evidence to support the study hypothesis: i.e. stating that interventions worked via non-conscious processes did not decrease their acceptability in either the UK or US samples. Perceived effectiveness was the strongest predictor of acceptability for all interventions across the two samples. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, nudge interventions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages seem similarly acceptable in the UK and USA, being more acceptable than taxation, but less acceptable than education. Contrary to prediction, we found no evidence that highlighting the non-conscious processes by which nudge interventions may work decreases their acceptability. However, highlighting the effectiveness of all interventions has the potential to increase their acceptability.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), little is known about behavioral interventions to reduce SSB intake among adults, particularly in medically-underserved rural communities. This type 1 effectiveness-implementation hybrid RCT, conducted in 2012-2014, applied the RE-AIM framework and was designed to assess the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention targeting SSB consumption (SIPsmartER) when compared to an intervention targeting physical activity (MoveMore) and to determine if health literacy influenced retention, engagement or outcomes. METHODS: Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and health literacy strategies, the 6 month multi-component intervention for both conditions included three small-group classes, one live teach-back call, and 11 interactive voice response calls. Validated measures were used to assess SSB consumption (primary outcome) and all secondary outcomes including physical activity behaviors, theory-based constructs, quality of life, media literacy, anthropometric, and biological outcomes. RESULTS: Targeting a medically-underserved rural region in southwest Virginia, 1056 adult participants were screened, 620 (59%) eligible, 301 (49%) enrolled and randomized, and 296 included in these 2015 analyses. Participants were 93% Caucasian, 81% female, 31 % ≤ high-school educated, 43% < $14,999 household income, and 33% low health literate. Retention rates (74%) and program engagement was not statistically different between conditions. Compared to MoveMore, SIPsmartER participants significantly decreased SSB kcals and BMI at 6 months. SIPsmartER participants significantly decreased SSB intake by 227 (95% CI = -326,-127, p < 0.001) kcals/day from baseline to 6 months when compared to the decrease of 53 (95% CI = -88,-17, p < 0.01) kcals/day among MoveMore participants (p < 0.001). SIPsmartER participants decreased BMI by 0.21 (95% CI = -0.35,-0.06; p < 0.01) kg/m(2) from baseline to 6 months when compared to the non-significant 0.10 (95 % CI = -0.23, 0.43; NS) kg/m(2) gain among MoveMore participants (p < 0.05). Significant 0-6 month effects were observed for about half of the theory-based constructs, but for no biological outcomes. Health literacy status did not influence retention rates, engagement or outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: SIPsmartER is an effective intervention to decrease SSB consumption among adults and is promising for translation into practice settings. SIPsmartER also yielded small, yet significant, improvements in BMI. By using health literacy-focused strategies, the intervention was robust in achieving reductions for participants of varying health literacy status.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sugar-sweetened-beverages (SSB) provide high amounts of rapidly absorbable sugar and have been shown to impair insulin sensitivity and promote weight gain. We hypothesized that when compared with high-glycemic index (GI) SSB low-GI SSB lead to lower insulin secretion and thus an improved preservation of insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation during an inactive phase. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a controlled cross-over dietary intervention 13 healthy men (age: 23.7±2.2 years, body mass index: 23.6±1.9 kg m(-)(2)) consumed low-GI (isomaltulose) or high-GI (75% maltodextrin+25% sucrose, adapted for sweetness) SSBs providing 20% of energy requirement for 7 days. During this phase, participant's habitual high physical activity (11 375±3124 steps per day) was reduced (2363±900 steps per day). The provided ad libitum diet comprised 55% CHO, 30% fat and 15% protein. Glycemic and insulinemic responses were assessed: Day-long (7-day continuous interstitial glucose monitoring, 24-h-urinary c-peptide excretion), during meal test (37 g isomaltulose vs 28 g maltodextrin+9g sucrose) and measures of insulin sensitivity (basal: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), postprandial: Matsuda-ISI). Macronutrient oxidation was assessed by non-protein respiratory quotient (npRQ) in the fasted state (npRQfasting) and postprandial as the area under the npRQ-curve during meal test (npRQtAUC-meal). RESULTS: Day-long glycemia was lower with low-GI compared with high-GI SSB (-5%, P<0.05). Low-GI SSB led to lower insulin secretion during meal test (-28%, P<0.01) and throughout the day (-31%, P<0.01), whereas postprandial glucose levels did not differ between low-GI and high-GI SSBs. Insulin sensitivity deteriorated on inactivity with both SSBs, but was better preserved with low-GI isomaltulose compared with high-GI maltodextrin-sucrose (ΔHOMA-IR: +0.37±0.52 vs +0.85±0.86; ΔMatsuda-ISI: -5.1±5.5 vs -9.6±5.1, both P<0.05). Both, fasting and postprandial fat oxidation declined on inactivity, with no difference between high-GI and low-GI SSBs. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with high-GI SSB, 7-day consumption of beverages sweetened with low-GI isomaltulose had beneficial effects on inactivity-induced impairment of glucose metabolism without effecting fuel selection.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) such as sodas, fruit-flavored drinks, and sports drinks is a major contributor to childhood obesity. One strategy to reduce children's SSB consumption has been to restrict the sale of SSBs in schools. However, such policies may not sufficiently curb students' SSB intake, because students can obtain SSBs elsewhere, including from stores located on their school commute. Little is known about students' purchases of beverages during the school commute or about whether this purchasing behavior is related to in-school SSB consumption. The objective of this study was to describe where students from low-income, ethnically diverse communities obtain the SSBs they drink during school lunchtime and to examine whether students who purchase beverages while traveling to and from school are more likely to drink SSBs during school lunchtime. METHODS: We analyzed survey data from a random sample of low-income, ethnically diverse middle school students (N = 597) who participated in a randomized controlled trial of a water promotion intervention. We used logistic regression analysis to examine the association between students' purchase of beverages during the school commute and their SSB consumption during school lunchtime. RESULTS: One-fifth (20.4%) of students drank an SSB during lunch. Approximately 23% of SSBs were obtained during the school commute. Students who reported buying beverages during their school commute (50.1% of all students) were more likely to report drinking SSBs during lunch than students who reported that they do not buy beverages during the school commute (adjusted odds ratio 3.32, 95% confidence interval, 2.19-5.05, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Students' purchase of beverages during the school commute was strongly associated with SSB consumption during school lunchtime. Interventions could benefit from focusing on retail environments (e.g., encouraging retailers to promote healthy beverages, posting beverage calorie information).",

      "abstract": "Adverse health consequences of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages are frequently cited as an example of market failure, justifying government intervention in the marketplace, usually in the form of taxation. However, declining sales of sugar-sweetened beverages in Australia and a corresponding increase in sales of drinks containing non-nutritive sweeteners, in the absence of significant government regulation, appear to reflect market forces at work. If so, the public health challenge in relation to sugar-sweetened beverages may have less to do with regulating the market and more to do with harnessing it. Contrary to assertions that consumers fail to appreciate the links between their choice of beverage and its health consequences, the health conscious consumer appears to be driving the changes taking place in the beverage market. With the capacity to meet consumer expectations for convenience and indulgence without unwanted kilojoules, drinks containing non-nutritive sweeteners enable the \"small change\" in health behaviour that individuals are willing to consider. Despite the low barriers involved in perpetuating the current trend of replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with drinks containing non-nutritive sweeteners, some public health advocates remain cautious about advocating this dietary change. In contrast, the barriers to taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages appear high.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interventions conducted in school-aged children often involve parents, but few studies have reported effects on parents' own behaviour as a result of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: To determine if a multi-component, cluster randomized controlled trial targeting 11-13 year olds influenced their consumption of fruit, vegetables, sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fruit drinks, and to explore whether the results varied by gender, adolescent weight status or parental educational level. A final aim was to assess whether the parents' intakes were affected by the intervention. DESIGN: Participants were 1,418 adolescents, 849 mothers and 680 fathers. Baseline and post-intervention data from the 20 months intervention study HEIA (HEalth In Adolescents) were included. Data were collected assessing frequency (and amounts; beverages only). RESULTS: No significant differences were found at baseline between the intervention and control groups, except for the parental groups (educational level and intakes). At post-intervention, the adolescents in the intervention group consumed fruit more frequently (P<0.001) and had a lower intake of sugar-sweetened fruit drinks compared to the control group (P=0.02). The parental educational level moderated the effect on intake of sugar-sweetened fruit drinks in adolescents. The intake was less frequent in the intervention groups compared to the control groups (P=0.02) for those who had parents with low and medium educational level. Furthermore, the intervention may have affected mothers' fruit intake and the vegetable intake in higher educated fathers. CONCLUSION: Favourable effects in favour of the intervention group were found for intake of fruit and sugar-sweetened fruit drinks among the adolescents in the HEIA study. Our results indicate that it is possible to reduce adolescents' intake of sugar-sweetened fruit drinks across parental education, and potentially affect sub-groups of parents."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mexico's sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake is among the highest globally. Although evidence shows that increases in SSB intake are linked with increased energy intake, weight gain, and cardiometabolic risks, few randomized clinical trials have been conducted in adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if replacing SSBs with water affects plasma triglycerides (TGs) (primary outcome), weight, and other cardiometabolic factors. METHODS: We selected overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 and <39 kg/m(2)) women (18-45 y old) reporting an SSB intake of at least 250 kcal/d living in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Women were randomly allocated to the water and education provision (WEP) group (n = 120) or the education provision (EP)-only group (n = 120). The WEP group received biweekly water deliveries, and both groups received equal monthly nutrition counseling. During nutrition counseling, the WEP group sessions included activities to encourage increased water intake, reduced SSB intake, and substitution of water for SSBs. Repeated 24-h dietary recalls, anthropometric measurements, and fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and at 3, 6, and 9 mo. The Markov-Monte Carlo method was used for multiple imputation; separate mixed-effects models tested each outcome. RESULTS: An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis indicated that the WEP group increased water intake and decreased SSB intake significantly over time, but there were no differences in plasma TG concentrations between groups at the end of the intervention (WEP at baseline: 155 ± 2.10 mg/dL; WEP at 9 mo: 149 ± 2.80 mg/dL; EP at baseline: 150 ± 1.90 mg/dL; EP at 9 mo: 161 ± 2.70 mg/dL; P for mean comparisons at 9 mo = 0.10). Secondary analyses showed significant effects on plasma TGs (change from baseline to 9 mo: WEP, -28.9 ± 7.7 mg/dL; EP, 8.5 ± 10.9 mg/dL; P = 0.03) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence at 9 mo (WEP: 18.1%; EP: 37.7%; P = 0.02) among obese participants. CONCLUSIONS: Providing water and nutritional counseling was effective in increasing water intake and in partially decreasing SSB intake. We found no effect on plasma TGs, weight, and other cardiometabolic risks in the ITT analysis, although the intervention lowered plasma TGs and MetS prevalence among obese participants. Further studies are warranted. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01245010.",

Therefore, our objective was to summarize current evidence for an association between SSB consumption and cardiovascular risk factors and events. DESIGN: The article search was performed in August 2013. Two independent researchers performed the article search and selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Eligible studies reported the intake of SSB and one of the following outcomes: change in blood pressure, blood lipid or blood sugar, or CVD events such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Only intervention and longitudinal studies were included. SUBJECTS: Only studies in adults (aged 18+ years old) were considered. RESULTS: Two of four prospective studies found clear direct associations between SSB consumption and CHD, while two of three studies, including both men and women, found direct associations between SSB consumption and stroke; however, the association was significant among women only. All included studies examining vascular risk factors found direct associations between SSB consumption and change in blood pressure, blood lipid or blood sugar. CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed studies generally showed that SSB intake was related to vascular risk factors, whereas associations with vascular events were less consistent. Due to a limited number of published papers, especially regarding vascular events, the strength of the evidence is still limited and hence more studies are needed before firm conclusions can be made.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both the prevalence of childhood obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have increased globally. The present review describes interventions that reduce the consumption of SSBs in children and determines whether this leads to subsequent changes in body fatness. METHODS: Three databases were searched from 2000 to August 2013. Only intervention control trials, ≥6 months in duration, which aimed to reduce the consumption of SSBs in >100 children aged 2-18 years, and reporting changes in body fatness, were included. The quality of selected papers was assessed. RESULTS: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Six interventions achieved significant (P < 0.05) reductions in SSB intake, although this was not always sustained. In the two interventions providing replacement drinks, significant differences in body mass index (12- or 18-month follow-up) were reported (P = 0.001 and 0.045). The risk of being overweight/obesity was reduced (P < 0.05) in three of the five education programmes but in one programme only for girls who were overweight at baseline and in one programme only for pupils perceived to be at greater risk at baseline. In the one study that included both provision of water and education, the risk of being overweight was reduced by 31% (P = 0.04) in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that school-based education programmes focusing on reducing SSB consumption, but including follow-up modules, offer opportunities for implementing effective, sustainable interventions. Peer support and changing the school environment (e.g. providing water or replacement drinks) to support educational programmes could improve their effectiveness. Home delivery of more suitable drinks has a big impact on reducing SSB consumption, with associated reductions in body weight.",

For example, we suggest that people might have more negative views toward the idea of consuming 28 sugar cubes (concrete information), compared to consuming \"70g\" of sugar (abstract information). Indeed, we found that, without any intervention, people struggle to convert sugar grams into a concrete, physical sugar representation (Experiment 1). But, when people are provided ways to convert abstract sugar-nutrition information into a concrete representation, they find SSBs less attractive (Experiment 2) and are less likely to select SSBs in favor of sugar-free beverage options (Experiments 3 and 4). These findings offer direct applications to the design of public-health messages and nutrition-education interventions. Such applications might benefit society in its battle with the obesity epidemic.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) may contribute to the development of overweight in children, effective interventions to reduce their consumption are needed. Here we evaluated the effect of a combined school- and community-based intervention aimed at reducing children's SSB consumption by promoting the intake of water. Favourable intervention effects on children's SSB consumption were hypothesized. METHODS: In 2011-2012, a controlled trial was conducted among four primary schools, comprising 1288 children aged 6-12 years who lived in multi-ethnic, socially deprived neighbourhoods in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Intervention schools adopted the 'water campaign', an intervention developed using social marketing. Control schools continued with their regular health promotion programme. Primary outcome was children's SSB consumption, measured using parent and child questionnaires and through observations at school, both at baseline and after one year of intervention. RESULTS: Significant positive intervention effects were found for average SSB consumption (B -0.19 litres, 95% CI -0.28;-0.10; parent report), average SSB servings (B -0.54 servings, 95% CI -0.82;-0.26; parent report) and bringing SSB to school (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36;0.72; observation report). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the effectiveness of the water campaign intervention in reducing children's SSB consumption. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings.

      "abstract": "Inhibitory control and sensitivity to reward are relevant to the food choices individuals make frequently. An imbalance of these systems can lead to deficits in decision-making that are relevant to food ingestion. This study evaluated the relationship between dietary behaviors - binge eating and consumption of sweetened beverages and snacks - and behavioral control processes among 198 adolescents, ages 14 to 17. Neurocognitive control processes were assessed with the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a generic Go/No-Go task, and a food-specific Go/No-Go task. The food-specific version directly ties the task to food cues that trigger responses, addressing an integral link between cue-habit processes. Diet was assessed with self-administered food frequency and binge eating questionnaires. Latent variable models revealed marked gender differences. Inhibitory problems on the food-specific and generic Go/No-Go tasks were significantly correlated with binge eating only in females, whereas inhibitory problems measured with these tasks were the strongest correlates of sweet snack consumption in males. Higher BMI percentile and sedentary behavior also predicted binge eating in females and sweet snack consumption in males. Inhibitory problems on the generic Go/No-Go, poorer affective decision-making on the IGT, and sedentary behavior were associated with sweetened beverage consumption in males, but not females. The food-specific Go/No-Go was not predictive in models evaluating sweetened beverage consumption, providing some initial discriminant validity for the task, which consisted of sweet/fatty snacks as no-go signals and no sugar-sweetened beverage signals. This work extends research findings, revealing gender differences in inhibitory function relevant to behavioral control. Further, the findings contribute to research implicating the relevance of cues in habitual behaviors and their relationship to snack food consumption in an understudied population of diverse adolescents not receiving treatment for eating disorders.",

We conducted a systematic review exploring the relation between consumption of SSB and BP. A comprehensive search in 5 electronic databases along with a bibliography search was performed. The keywords \"sugar sweetened beverages,\" \"sugary drinks,\" \"added sugars,\" \"blood pressure,\" and \"hypertension\" were indexed in all combinations. Studies were included that reported the effects of intake of SSBs on BP. We excluded studies with <100 subjects and those involving subjects aged <12 years. Of 605 potentially relevant studies, a total of 12 studies (409,707 participants) met our inclusion criteria; 6 were cross sectional studies, whereas the rest were prospective cohort studies. All 12 studies showed positive relation between increased SSB intake and hypertension; however, statistical significance was reported in 10 of these studies. Of the 12 studies, 5 reported an increase in mean BP whereas 7 reported an increase in the incidence of high BP. In conclusion, our systematic review shows that the consumption of SSBs is associated with higher BP, leading to increased incidence of hypertension. Restriction on SSB consumption should be incorporated in the recommendations of lifestyle modifications for the treatment of hypertension. Interventions to reduce intake of SSBs should be an integral part of public health strategy to reduce the incidence of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: The impact of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) on lipid metabolism when consumed in moderate amounts by normal weight subjects is debated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of different types of sugars in SSB on fatty acid metabolism (ie, fatty acid synthesis and oxidation) in healthy young men. DESIGN: Thirty-four normal-weight men were studied in a randomized crossover study. Four isocaloric 3-week interventions with SSB were performed in random order: medium fructose (MF; 40 g/d); high fructose (HF; 80 g/d), high sucrose (HS; 80 g/d), and high glucose (HG; 80g/d). Fasting total plasma fatty acid composition was measured after each intervention. Acylcarnitines were measured in the fasting state and after a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in nine subjects. RESULTS: The relative abundance of palmitate (16:0) and the molar fatty acid ratio of palmitate to linoleic acid (16:0 to18:2) as markers of fatty acid synthesis were increased after HF [relative abundance of palmitate: 22.97% ± 5.51% (percentage of total fatty acids by weight ±SD)] and MF (26.1% ± 1.7%) compared with HS (19.40% ± 2.91%, P < .001), HG (19.43% ±3.12 %, P < .001), or baseline (19.40% ± 2.79%, P < .001). After HS and HG, the relative abundance of palmitate was equal to baseline. Fasting palmitoylcarnitine was significantly increased after HF and HS (HF and HS vs. HG: P = .005), decreasing after inhibition of lipolysis by insulin in the clamp. CONCLUSIONS: When consumed in moderate amounts, fructose but not sucrose or glucose in SSB increases fatty acid synthesis (palmitate), whereas fasting long-chain acylcarnitines are increased after both fructose and sucrose, indicating an impaired β-oxidation flux.",

RESULTS: Four studies were found. In one of the studies, after the reduction of SSB consumption, a small reduction of BMI was observed (p = 0.045). Another study showed that the reduction of 355 ml/day was associated with a weight loss of 0.7 kg (95% CI: 0.2-1.1, p = 0.01). In a different study, in the group consuming regular Coke, an increase in the visceral: abdominal subcutaneous fat ratio, was observed (p = 0.01). In another study, there were no differences on adiposity between the intervention and control groups.

OBJECTIVE: We expanded evidence mapping methods by demonstrating their usefulness as a tool for organizing epidemiologic research on sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake and health outcomes: obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease/stroke. DESIGN: We performed a search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases and a hand search of references. Studies selected were reviews and longitudinal studies (intervention and cohort) published between 1 January 1966 and 31 October 2012. RESULTS: We identified and mapped 77 studies (18 review and 59 primary research articles); most of the research focused on obesity (n = 47). For all outcomes, >30% (n = 18) of the primary research studies we identified were not referenced in published reviews. We found considerable variability among primary research studies of SSBs and the 4 health outcomes in terms of designs, definitions of SSBs, and definitions of outcomes, which renders these studies difficult to interpret collectively. For example, we counted 14 different definitions of weight/obesity in 29 observational cohort studies, and ≤6 studies reported the use of the same outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing field standards in the study of SSB intake and health outcomes would facilitate interpretation across research studies and thereby increase the utility of systematic reviews/meta-analyses and ultimately the efficiency of research efforts. Rapid publication of new data suggests the need for regular updates and caution when reading reviews.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sucrose-sweetened beverages (SSB) have for decades been implicated in cardiometabolic diseases. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent epidemiological but particularly recent human intervention studies on the metabolic effects associated/induced by SSB. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiological studies support the positive association between SSB intake and enhanced risk for metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart diseases, and stroke. From the human intervention studies rather similar results are obtained with enhanced accumulation of fat in the liver, muscle, and in the visceral fat depot induced by SSB. Moreover, SSB induces enhanced levels of circulating triglycerides and enhanced de-novo lipogenesis in the liver. The specific effect of SSB on body weigh/obesity is still not completely elucidated but SSB enhances body weight/fat mass even though not to a significant degree in all studies. Concerning the mechanisms for SSB to induce these metabolic aberrations most of the studies are in agreement with the fact that it is mainly fructose (free or as part of the sucrose molecule) that is the main driver of these metabolic aberrations presumably primarily by inducing lipid synthesis in and release from the liver. SUMMARY: There are now convincing evidences for enhanced cardiometabolic risk after higher intake of SSB where both epidemiological studies and human intervention studies are pointing in the same direction. A so-called 'well tolerated' intake of SSB is not determined. Accordingly, intake of SSB should generally be reduced as much as possible to improve the health of the population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages may cause excessive weight gain. We aimed to assess the effect on weight gain of an intervention that included the provision of noncaloric beverages at home for overweight and obese adolescents. METHODS: We randomly assigned 224 overweight and obese adolescents who regularly consumed sugar-sweetened beverages to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received a 1-year intervention designed to decrease consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, with follow-up for an additional year without intervention. We hypothesized that the experimental group would gain weight at a slower rate than the control group. RESULTS: Retention rates were 97% at 1 year and 93% at 2 years. Reported consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was similar at baseline in the experimental and control groups (1.7 servings per day), declined to nearly 0 in the experimental group at 1 year, and remained lower in the experimental group than in the control group at 2 years. The primary outcome, the change in mean body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) at 2 years, did not differ significantly between the two groups (change in experimental group minus change in control group, -0.3; P=0.46). At 1 year, however, there were significant between-group differences for changes in BMI (-0.57, P=0.045) and weight (-1.9 kg, P=0.04). We found evidence of effect modification according to ethnic group at 1 year (P=0.04) and 2 years (P=0.01). In a prespecified analysis according to ethnic group, among Hispanic participants (27 in the experimental group and 19 in the control group), there was a significant between-group difference in the change in BMI at 1 year (-1.79, P=0.007) and 2 years (-2.35, P=0.01), but not among non-Hispanic participants (P>0.35 at years 1 and 2). The change in body fat as a percentage of total weight did not differ significantly between groups at 2 years (-0.5%, P=0.40). There were no adverse events related to study participation. CONCLUSIONS: Among overweight and obese adolescents, the increase in BMI was smaller in the experimental group than in the control group after a 1-year intervention designed to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, but not at the 2-year follow-up (the prespecified primary outcome).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few data are available linking intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, findings from these studies are inconsistent and most are from Western societies; no information is available in this regard from Middle Eastern populations. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the relationship between SSB consumption and metabolic syndrome in an Iranian adult population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data from 1,752 people (782 men and 970 women) that were selected with the multistage cluster random sampling method from three counties of Isfahan, Najafabad and Arak were used. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess participants' usual dietary intakes. Consumption of SSBs was calculated by summing up the consumption of 'soft drinks' and 'artificially sweetened fruit juices'. To categorize participants, we used three levels of SSB consumption: <1 time/week, 1-3 times/week, and >3 times/week. Biochemical assessments were done after an overnight fasting. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the guidelines of Adult Treatment Panel III. RESULTS: Subjects with high consumption of SSBs (>3 times/week) were younger than those with low consumption (<1 time/week). Mean BMI was not significantly different across SSB categories. High consumption of SSBs was associated with greater intakes of energy and almost all food groups. We found a significant difference in serum triglyceride levels between men consuming SSBs 1-3 times/week and those consuming <1 time/week. However, after controlling for potential confounders, this association disappeared. In crude models, no significant associations were found between SSB intake and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in either gender. After adjustment for potential confounders including BMI, we found that men in the top category of SSB intake were 17% more likely to have the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.56-2.46), while women in the highest category were 20% less likely to have the syndrome (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.46-1.42) as compared with those in the bottom category. However, these associations were not significant in either men or women. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the previous findings on the association between SSB consumption and metabolic syndrome. Prospective studies are needed to further explore for this association.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We examined the effect of an intervention to provide caloric information about sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on the number of SSB purchases. METHODS: We used a case-crossover design with 4 corner stores located in low-income, predominately Black neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland. The intervention randomly posted 1 of 3 signs with the following caloric information: (1) absolute caloric count, (2) percentage of total recommended daily intake, and (3) physical activity equivalent. We collected data for 1600 beverage sales by Black adolescents, aged 12-18 years, including 400 during a baseline period and 400 for each of the 3 caloric condition interventions. RESULTS: Providing Black adolescents with any caloric information significantly reduced the odds of SSB purchases relative to the baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36, 0.89). When examining the 3 caloric conditions separately, the significant effect was observed when caloric information was provided as a physical activity equivalent (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.31, 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Providing easily understandable caloric information--particularly a physical activity equivalent--may reduce calorie intake from SSBs among low-income, Black adolescents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with overweight in observational studies. A possible explanation is that liquid sugars do not satiate and that their intake is not compensated by reduced caloric intake from other foods. However, evidence from intervention studies for this hypothesis is inconclusive because previous studies were not blinded. Hence results may have been influenced by expectations and behavioral cues rather than by physiological mechanisms. METHODS: We designed the Double-blind, Randomized INtervention study in Kids (DRINK) to examine the effect on body weight of covertly replacing sugar-sweetened by sugar-free beverages. Children were only eligible if they habitually drank sugar-sweetened beverages. We recruited 642 healthy children (mean age 8.2, range 4.8-11.9). We designed, tested and produced custom-made beverages containing 10% sugar and sugar-free beverages with the same sweet taste and look. Children receive one 250 mL can of study beverage daily for 18 months. We perform body measurements at 0, 6, 12 and 18 months. The primary outcome is the z-score of BMI for age. The maximum predicted difference in this score between groups is 0.72, which corresponds with a difference in body weight of 2.3 kg. DISCUSSION: The double-blind design eliminates behavioral factors that affect body weight. If children gain less body fat when drinking sugar-free than when drinking sugar-sweetened beverages that would show that liquid sugar indeed bypasses biological satiation mechanisms. It would also suggest that a reduction in liquid sugars could decrease body fat more effectively than reduction of other calorie sources.",
