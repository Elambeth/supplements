      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Numerous barriers to moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) exist for youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The virtual exercise games for youth with T1D (ExerT1D) intervention implements synchronous support of MVPA including T1D peers and role models. OBJECTIVE: To understand the acceptability of this intervention to participants. METHODS: We conducted post-program, semi-structured, televideo interviews with participating youth to elicit perspectives on acceptability of the intervention and experience with the program. Two coders independently reviewed and analyzed each transcript using a coding scheme developed inductively by senior researchers. Discrepancies were resolved by team discussion, and multiple codes were grouped together to produce four main thematic areas. RESULTS: All 15 participants provided interviews [14-19 years old; 2 non-binary, 6 females; 7.8% median HbA1c, 5 with HbA1c≥10.0%]. Qualitative data revealed four themes. (1) Motivation to engage in PA: Improving their physical capabilities and/or stabilizing glucose levels were cited as motivation for PA. Challenges of living with T1D were cited as PA barriers. (2) Experience with and motivation to manage diabetes while engaging in PA: Participants provided details of accommodating the inherent uncertainty or limitations of PA with diabetes. Sometimes preparing for PA involved psychological and motivational adjustments. Some relayed feelings of avoidance. (3) Peer support encouraged engagement with the intervention: Participants appreciated the peer aspects of components of ExerT1D. Participants' reflections of the facilitated group experience highlight many benefits of a small-group virtual program. (4) Improvements in PA and diabetes self-management efficacy: All participants credited the program with improving and/or raising awareness of T1D management skills. CONCLUSIONS: Our virtual PA intervention using an active video game and discussion component provided adolescents with T1D the confidence and peer support to engage in PA, improve awareness of diabetes-specific tasks to prepare for exercise, and improved understanding of the effect of PA on glucose levels. Engaging youth with a virtual videogame intervention is a viable approach to overcome barriers to PA for adolescents with T1D. CLINICALTRIAL: Interviewed participants of clinical trial NCT05163912."

      "abstract": "Many neurological conditions, e.g., a stroke, can cause patients to experience upper limb (UL) motor impairments that hinder their daily activities. For such patients, while rehabilitation therapy is key for regaining autonomy and restoring mobility, its long-term nature entails ongoing time commitment and it is often not sufficiently engaging. Virtual reality (VR) can transform rehabilitation therapy into engaging game-like tasks that can be tailored to patient-specific activities, set goals, and provide rehabilitation assessment. Yet, most VR systems lack built-in methods to track progress over time and alter rehabilitation programs accordingly. We propose using arm kinematic modeling and capability maps to allow a VR system to understand a user's physical capability and limitation. Next, we suggest two use cases for the VR system to utilize the user's capability map for tailoring rehabilitation programs. Finally, for one use case, it is shown that the VR system can emphasize and assess the use of specific UL joints.Clinical relevance-This paper's VR-based system can tailor a rehabilitation tool to a user's capability and limit.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to promote a coherent pedagogical framework for integrating mobile exergames into physical education (PE) as a strategy to reduce sedentary behavior. The intervention was grounded in the game-based learning methodology, assessing the impact of exergame practice on the physical and mental well-being of prospective PE teachers. The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale and a mental effort scale were used to evaluate perceived exertion across various mini-games, measuring physical intensity, motor engagement, and mental effort with participation from 130 undergraduate students in Physical Activity and Sport Sciences. Additionally, the pedagogical and motivational aspects of the Active Arcade v3.11 video game were analyzed to support its future integration into secondary education PE classes. Participants reported high levels of motor engagement throughout the program, accompanied by moderate physical intensity. They also emphasized the user-friendly nature of these augmented reality exergames and expressed enjoyment during the sessions. The findings suggest that mobile exergames hold considerable potential for enhancing skill acquisition and fundamental motor skills while promoting healthy habits among students in PE classes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional rehabilitation programs for children with cerebral palsy and acquired brain injuries aim to enhance motor and cognitive abilities through repetitive exercises, which are often perceived as tedious and demotivating. Extended reality technologies, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality, offer more engaging methods through exergames. However, to date, no AR exergames simultaneously integrate cognitive and motor aspects within navigational tasks. Developing these exergames necessitates rigorous methodological steps, especially when using emerging technologies such as AR. The MIDE (Multidisciplinary Iterative Design of Exergames) framework advocates a participatory design approach, involving users from the outset, the objective being to optimize the interface and validate game mechanics through user experience (UX) assessment. Some researchers initially test these mechanisms on healthy children before applying them to clinical populations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the UX of our AR exergames, consisting of two games (AR Corsi and AR Zoo), in typically developing children. METHODS: Typically developing children participated in two 1.5-hour sessions. During each session, they played one of two AR games using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 headset: AR Corsi and AR Zoo, both of which are designed to engage executive functions and motor skills through navigational capabilities. UX was assessed after each session using the following measures: System Usability Scale scores for usability, AttrakDiff for attractiveness and game quality, MeCue for emotional experience, and Rating scale of Perceived Exertion for Children for pre- and postsession mental and physical fatigue. RESULTS: A total of 27 participants (mean age 11.9, SD 1.2 years) were included in the study. Mean System Usability Scale scores were 79.9 (SD 11.4) for AR Corsi and 76.3 (SD 12.1) for AR Zoo, indicating good usability. The AttrakDiff questionnaire yielded favorable results, with scores between 1 and 3 for overall attractiveness, pragmatic quality, and stimulation for both AR games. However, the hedonic quality \"identity\" received neutral scores (mean 0.6, SD 0.5 for AR Corsi and mean 0.7, SD 0.8 for AR Zoo). The MeCue emotions module yielded average scores of 5.2 (SD 0.7) for AR Corsi and 5.3 (SD 0.8) for AR Zoo, significantly exceeding the theoretical mean of 4 (P<.001). We observed a significant effect of physical fatigue (P=.02) and mental fatigue (P=.002) after exposure to both games. A comparative analysis of UX between the two games showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that our exergame, comprising two AR games, is user-friendly and well-received by typically developing children, eliciting positive emotions and overall appeal. Although some children reported fatigue, favorable UX evaluation confirms the validity of the game's content and mechanisms, suggesting its suitability for use among children with cerebral palsy and acquired brain injuries."

      "abstract": "Exergames have the potential to be used as physical-cognitive training tools. Although numerous studies investigated the physical and motivational effects of Exergaming, a comprehensive summary of training effects in healthy adults is still missing. This scoping review aims to identify available evidence and research gaps on absolute and relative effects of Exergame training on physical indicators (effectiveness) and motivation (attractiveness) compared to no or conventional training in healthy adults. A systematic literature search was performed in EBSCOhost, WoS CC, SURF, and Science Research for studies meeting the following criteria: a) randomized controlled trials with Exergames compared to conventional training and/ or no treatment; b) healthy adults (age: 18 to 64 years); c) Exergame training interventions; d) assessment of pre-post differences, primary outcomes: endurance, strength, flexibility, speed, balance, sensorimotor coordination, sports skills, player experience; secondary outcomes: adverse events, physical activity level, attitudes, and knowledge. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the PEDro Scale. Charted data were categorized according to the PICOS framework. Mean differences, 95% confidence intervals, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated for continuous outcomes. Evidence Maps were created to illustrate the estimated Risk of Bias, estimated effect, and sample sizes. Eighteen publications with 907 participants were included. The number of studies per outcome was low (2 to 9balance:). Studies on coordination and knowledge were lacking. No study analyzed the relative effects of speed training with Exergames. Absolute effects of Exergame training ranged from no to large effects. Significant ES were consistently found for skill training. Negative effects were found for individual parameters. Relative effects of Exergame training ranged from no to large effects (one exception). A moderate absolute effect favoring traditional training was found for skill training. The remaining results suggest that Exergaming elicited similar training effects compared to conventional training. A high variance of applied training, corresponding training parameters (FITT-VP), outcome measures, as well as methodological deficits and incomplete reporting were identified in included studies. Therefore, a lack of high-quality studies and reviews was identified. Future research should conduct high quality RCT studies analyzing the effectiveness and attractiveness in Exergames. In addition, more suitable, well-designed Exergames should be developed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The worldwide rise in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases has increased the recognition of the need to identify modifiable risk factors for preventing and managing these diseases. The office worker, as a representative group of physically inactive workers, is exposed to risk factors for metabolic syndrome, which is a primary driver of noncommunicable diseases. The use of virtual reality (VR) exergames may offer a potential solution to the problem of increasing noncommunicable disease prevalence, as it can help individuals increase their physical activity levels while providing a more immersive experience. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aims to examine the interventional efficacy of at-home immersive VR exergames on metabolic syndrome biomarkers among office workers. Additionally, it seeks to investigate the impacts of at-home immersive VR exergames on the active and sedentary behaviors of office workers. METHODS: A 3-arm, single-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted to examine the therapeutic effects of at-home immersive VR exergames. A total of 120 Chinese office workers, engaging in less than 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity, will be recruited via a convenience sampling method. The participants, who will be tested over a 12-week period, will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) the VR exergame intervention group, (2) the regular physical activity control group, and (3) the nonexercise control group. Throughout the 12-week trial, three categories of variables will be collected across the three groups: clinical risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, active and sedentary behaviors, and demographics. To analyze variance among the groups, a mixed linear model will be applied to assess the efficacy of each group. Differences in metabolic syndrome clinical risk factors among all groups will be used to evaluate the effects of at-home immersive VR exergames. Changes in active and sedentary behaviors will also be used to determine the impacts of VR exergames on metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: The ethics committee of Guangzhou University, China, approved this study on September 25, 2024. Participant recruitment will begin in early 2025 and continue for approximately 3 months. Data will be analyzed after the 12-week trial is completed, with full results expected to be presented in early 2026. CONCLUSIONS: This study explores an emerging topic by applying an at-home immersive VR exergame intervention, potentially contributing to understanding the effects of an exergame program on metabolic syndrome risk among office workers.

Exergames have emerged as promising tools for rehabilitating this demographic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize the combined evidence from meta-analyses that assessed the effects of exergames in the rehabilitation of stroke survivors. METHODS: The umbrella review was conducted utilizing several databases, including MEDLINE® (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), CINAHL® (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, SPORTDiscus®, and Scopus®. It included studies published until December 2023 without any restrictions based on publication date. RESULTS: The analysis included 11 meta-analyses involving approximately 9,615 patients, reflecting a growing adoption of exergames in post-stroke rehabilitation since 2015, focusing on using Nintendo Wii. The analyzed studies varied widely in intervention duration (from 1 to 16 weeks) and were applied across different phases of post-stroke rehabilitation, from the acute to the chronic phase. Significant improvements were observed in balance and upper limb functionality, although there was notable methodological heterogeneity and variability in the results. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the value of exergames in the rehabilitation of stroke survivors and recommends future research that adopts rigorous methodological designs with clearly specified intervention stages. It underscores the importance of additional qualitative studies to explore the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals regarding exergames, aiming to refine rehabilitation strategies and enhance the clinical benefits achieved.",

Materials and Methods: In a single-blinded clinical trial, 40 participants with CLBP were randomly assigned to either the EXG group or the CSEs group. The EXG group engaged in a single session of exergames using the Xbox Kinect device, while the CSEs group completed a single session of common core stability exercises. Measurements of attention, working memory, pain intensity, mood states, and FAB were taken before and after each intervention. Results: The results showed that a single session of EXG was significantly more effective than CSEs in improving cognitive reaction time, pain intensity, FAB, and positive mood states (P ≤ 0.05). Additionally, participants reported lower perceived exertion due to exercising following EXG compared with CSEs. Conclusion: EXG may have potential therapeutic advantages over traditional exercise interventions for CLBP."

Because of its simplicity, time spent in therapy is the most commonly used measure of therapy intensity. However, time spent in therapy is only a vague estimate of how hard a patient works during therapy. Several measures have been proposed to better capture the amount of work a patient puts forth during therapy. Still, it has never been analyzed how these measures respond to changes in therapist-selected exercise intensity in children with neurological conditions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the response and the reliability of heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance (SC), activity counts per minute (AC/min), movement repetitions per minute (MOV/min), and perceived exertion to different therapist-tailored intensity levels of upper limb technology-assisted therapy in children with neurological conditions. METHODS: In this pilot cross-sectional study, participants engaged in three personalized, randomized exergame intensity levels (\"very easy\", \"challenging\", \"very difficult\") for eight minutes each. We assessed all measures at each intensity level. The experiment was conducted twice on two consecutive days. We quantified reliability using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: We included 12 children and adolescents aged 11.92 (±3.03) years. HRV, MOV/min, and perceived exertion could differentiate among the three intensity levels. HRV, MOV/min, perceived exertion, and AC/min showed moderate to excellent (0.62 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.98) test-retest reliability. CONCLUSION: HRV, MOV/min, and perceived exertion show potential for becoming valid and reliable intensity measures for an upper limb robotic rehabilitative setting. However, studies with larger sample sizes and more standardized approaches are needed to understand these measures' responses better."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of exergaming on physical fitness, body composition and perceived enjoyment in elementary school children. METHODS: Sixty-four male students (mean age 9.5 years) were randomly assigned to an exergaming group (EG, n = 32), engaging in Kinect Adventures three times a week for six months, or a control group (CG, n = 32), which continued standard physical education. Assessments were conducted pre- and post-intervention, including anthropometric measures, physical fitness tests (standing long jump, countermovement jump, sit-and-reach, 20-m sprint), aerobic fitness (20-m shuttle run), and perceived enjoyment measured with the PACES scale. RESULTS: The EG demonstrated significant reductions in body weight, BMI, and relative fat mass compared to the CG (p < 0.01). Improvements in physical fitness were evident in EG, with increases in standing long jump distance (+12.8%; p < 0.0001), countermovement jump height (+65%, p < 0.0001), and flexibility (+75%; p < 0.0001). Aerobic fitness improved significantly in EG (+87.8m) compared to CG. Perceived enjoyment was notably higher in EG, especially at week three, compared to CG (69.3 ± 5.8 vs. 44.2 ± 11.6; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Exergaming offers benefits for physical fitness and body composition in children, while also enhancing enjoyment. Incorporating exergames into physical education programs could be an effective strategy for addressing childhood obesity, improving physical skills, and increasing student enjoyment, encouraging long-term physical activity adherence."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of a single session of a VR exergame (Beat Saber) and a VR nature video (Ireland 4K) on attentional performance, using the Flanker and Attentional Blink (AB) tasks. The objective was to assess whether these VR interventions could enhance attentional control, as measured by improvements in response times and accuracy. METHODS: A total of 39 psychology students, aged 19-25, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VR exergame, VR nature video, or control. Participants completed the Flanker and AB tasks before and after the intervention. A repeated measures design was employed to analyze changes in response times and accuracy across pre- and post-test sessions. RESULTS: The study revealed significant improvements in response times and accuracy across all groups in the post-test measures, indicating a strong training effect. In the AB task, shorter stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) led to decreased accuracy and slower response times, emphasizing the difficulty in processing closely spaced targets. The interaction between Type and Group in response times for target stimuli suggested that the intervention types differentially influenced processing speed in specific conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that while brief VR interventions did not produce significant differences between groups, the training effect observed highlights the influence of task-specific factors such as SOA and target presence. Further research is needed to explore whether longer or repeated VR sessions, as well as the optimization of task-specific parameters, might lead to more pronounced cognitive benefits."

      "abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative autoimmune disease caused by myelin loss in the central nervous system, which leads to motor and non-motor problems. The main objective of this study was to explore whether an immersive virtual reality (IVR) exercise programme would be feasible as a form of physical therapy for people with MS (pwMS). Methods: 18 participants (13 women; 45.06 years) were assigned to an experimental group (EG, n = 8) and a control group (CG, n = 10). The EG took part in a twice-weekly IVR exergame physical therapy programme-ExeRVIEM programme. A randomised, single-blind clinical trial was conducted and was registered in clinicaltrials (NCT05870254). Results: The intervention was feasible and safe. The participants completed the programme with no adverse effects (no symptoms on the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire), high usability (System Usability Scale 90.31%), and outstandingly positive post-game experiences (Game Experience Questionnaire 3.10/4). In addition, the GE significantly improved several of their functional capacities: increased lower limb strength (Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test p = 0.042), improved functional mobility, and reduced fall risk (Timed Up and Go Test-simple p = 0.009; Timed Up and Go Test-cognitive p = 0.003). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups. Conclusions: The findings support that the use of exergames and IVR as physical therapy in pwMS is feasible and safe. Furthermore, there is the suggestion of possible benefits to participants' functional abilities, all of which position IVR as a promising tool for the rehabilitation of this neurodegenerative pathology affecting young adults."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prolonged sedentary behavior, such as sitting or reclining, has consistently been identified as a stand-alone risk factor for heightened cardiometabolic risk and overall mortality. Conversely, interrupting sedentary periods by incorporating short, active microbreaks has been shown to mitigate the negative effects of sedentary behavior. Casual exergames, which mix elements of casual gaming with physical activity, are one prospective intervention to reduce sedentary behavior because they require physical exertion. Casual exergames have shown promise in fostering emotional and physical advantages when played in specific circumstances. However, little research exists on how different types of movement interactions impact the psychological effects as well as the physical exertion of playing casual exergames. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this work was to explore the psychological effects and physical exertion of playing casual exergames lasting 2 minutes. More precisely, the investigation focused on comparing upper body and full body movement interactions. In addition, the work examined variations in body positions, considering both standing and seated positions during upper body movement interactions. METHODS: Two casual exergames were developed and investigated through 2 quasi-experimental studies. In study 1, we investigated how players' perceptions of control, exertion, and immersion were affected by using upper body as opposed to full body exergame controllers when playing casual exergames. In study 2, we investigated differences in positive affect, performance, enjoyment, and exertion when playing casual exergames with upper body movement interactions in seated and standing positions. RESULTS: Study 1 showed that perceived control was significantly higher for upper body movement interactions than for full body movement interactions (P=.04), but there were no significant differences regarding perceived exertion (P=.15) or immersion (P=.66). Study 2 showed that positive affect increased significantly for both standing (P=.003) and seated (P=.001) gameplay. The participants in the standing gameplay group showed slightly higher actual exertion; however, there were no differences between the groups in terms of positive affect, perceived exertion, enjoyment, or performance. CONCLUSIONS: Casual exergames controlled by upper body movement interactions in seated gameplay can produce similar psychological effects and physical exertion as upper body movement interactions in standing gameplay and full body movement interactions. Therefore, upper body and seated casual exergames should not be overlooked as a suitable microbreak activity."

Their use in the home environment enables an expanded understanding about its applicability and its impact on clinical outcomes that can contribute to improved functionality and quality of life in this population. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the evidence on the usability of exergames as a tool for home-based balance training in older adults. METHODS: The search was realized in 6 electronic databases and were included 1) randomized controlled trials with exergames home-based training as intervention, 2) studies involving older adults (aged 60 years or older) described as having impaired static or dynamic balance, 3) that compared the effects of exergames to usual care, health education or no intervention, and 4) reported usability and balance outcomes. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials version 2 and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation were used to evaluate the methodological quality of studies and levels of evidence for outcomes. RESULTS: After screening 1107 records, we identified 4 trials were included. The usability score of exergames was classified as an acceptable, good, and feasible tool. The pooled effect indicated improvements in favor of the exergame group for functional balance by TUG test (MD = -5.90; 95%CI = -10.29 to -1.51) with low-certainty evidence and Tinetti scale (MD = 4.80; 95%CI = 3.36 to 6.24) with very low-certainty evidence. Analyzing the different immersion level, it was observed a significant difference in the experimental group for the immersive exergames (MD = -9.14; 95%CI = -15.51 to -2.77) with very low-certainty evidence. CONCLUSION: Exergames applied at home showed good usability and had significant effects on functional balance compared to usual care or no intervention, especially in the immersive modality.

Method: We engaged 48 participants, primarily from low-SES communities in Singapore for a 4-week community-based exergaming intervention. Participants were divided into four groups as follows: (1) conventional exercise alone, (2) exergames alone, (3) exergames with a health coach, and (4) exergames with a peer. Using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, we analyzed the effects of these interventions. Results: The findings revealed that all exergaming modes positively influenced exercise intentions, fear of falling, and emotional well-being to varying extents. Notably, exergaming with a health coach significantly improved participants' exercise intentions and emotional well-being, underscoring the value of expert guidance in motivating and supporting older adults in adopting healthier lifestyles. Exergaming with a peer was most effective in reducing fear of falling, highlighting the importance of social support and peer interaction in addressing physical health concerns among this population. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the potential of tailored exergame interventions incorporating various social interactions to improve health outcomes for older adults, contributing to more inclusive health promotion strategies.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Exergames are an innovative method that can promote neuroplasticity and improve the cognitive abilities of the elderly. This study aimed to compare the effects of single-task and multi-task exergames on the cognitive ability of the elderly with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Computerized literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Elsevier, ProQuest, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and VIP database to identify relevant articles from the establishment of the database from inception to April 1, 2024. The inclusion criteria were: (i) participants aged 60 or older diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, regardless of gender; (ii) use of randomized controlled trials (RCTs); (iii) interventions involving exergames with physical activity or as the primary variable; and (iv) outcome measures using standardized neuropsychological instruments to assess cognitive function, including statistical data on sample size, mean, and standard deviation. Finally, the included study comprised a total of 526 participants. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to synthesize the effect size in the data. RESULTS: 11 studies were included. Due to the differences in the intervention methods, subgroup analysis was performed on the included research. Compared with the control group assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, the single-task intervention improved the cognitive ability of the elderly with MCI (MD 3.40, 95% CI 2.43-4.37), the Mini-Mental State Examination Scale (MD 2.38, 95% CI -2.03 to 2.72), the Trail Making Test (MD -3.89, 95% CI -6.45 to -1.33), and the Digit Span Forward test (MD 1.16, 95% CI 0.73-1.60). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis supports that exergames could be an effective cognitive rehabilitation method for MCI patients. Our study recommends that patients implement a customized exergames program and adhere to it for a long time. It is necessary to pay attention to the exercise guidelines and provide evidence from clinicians. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY: (1) This meta-analysis supports that exergames could be an effective cognitive rehabilitation method for MCI patients. Our study recommends that patients implement a customized exergames program and adhere to it for a long time. It is necessary to pay attention to the exercise guidelines and provide evidence from clinicians. (2) This research provides preliminary evidence for the clinical utility of VR tasks developed for mild cognitive impairment. (3) In this paper, only relevant studies in Chinese and English were searched, and no studies in other languages were searched."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Falls prevention is a global priority given its substantial impact on older adults and cost to healthcare systems. Advances in telerehabilitation technology such as `exergaming' show potential for delivering accessible, engaging exercise programs for older adults. This study aimed to establish the feasibility, acceptability and usability of exergaming in sheltered housing. METHODS: A mixed-methods study with participants randomised in 2 sheltered housing facilities to intervention (n = 1 home, 12 participants) and control (n = 1 home 2, 12 participants) provided usual care for all, (physiotherapy prescribed strength and balance exercises and falls prevention advice) and a 6-week supervised exergaming programme (MIRA) offered 3 times per week to the intervention group only. At 6 weeks, feasibility, usability and acceptability outcomes were collected and analysed using descriptive statistics; qualitative focus groups with participants and interviews with staff were also completed and thematically analysed to elicit barriers and facilitators to usability and acceptability. RESULTS: Mean exercise per week increased from 10.6 to 14.1 minutes in the control group and 9.6 to 36.8 minutes in the intervention group. All study processes and measures appeared feasible; 72% of those invited consented to taking part and 92% completed 6-week follow-up. Individual domains for the System Usability Scores (SUS) showed participants felt `very confident' using the system with support (70%), would `like to use exergames frequently' (50%) and found the system `easy to use' (90%). However, they also felt they `needed to learn a lot at the beginning' (40%) and would `need technical support' (70%) for independent use of the exergames. Mean overall SUS was 63 reflecting moderate usability for independent use. Qualitative data indicated exergames were well received and highlighted motivational and social aspects; costs and set up. Staff also felt exergaming complemented traditional care. DISCUSSION: Our study contributes to the evidence guiding the use of exergames to deliver suitable falls prevention interventions for older adults within sheltered housing in community settings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is on the rise globally, and the use of antidepressant medications for its treatment does not usually result in full remission. However, the combination of physical exercise and psychotherapy for the treatment of MDD increase the rate of full remission among patients. This three-armed, parallel-group, double-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess and compare the effects between the combination of exergame and acceptance and commitment therapy (e-ACT) programme, ACT only and treatment-as-usual (TAU) control groups on the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, the degree of experiential avoidance and quality of life (QoL) and the serum levels of depression biomarkers (such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, C-reactive protein and vascular endothelial growth factor) among patients with MDD across three time points. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This RCT will recruit 126 patients with MDD who will be randomised using stratified permuted block randomisation into three groups, which are the combined e-ACT programme, ACT-only and TAU control groups in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The participants in the e-ACT and ACT-only intervention groups will undergo once a week intervention sessions for 8 weeks. Assessments will be carried out through three time points, such as the pre-intervention assessment (t0), assessment immediately after completion of the intervention at 8 weeks (t1) and assessment at 24 weeks after completion of the intervention (t2). During each assessment, the primary outcome to be assessed includes the severity of depression symptoms, while the secondary outcomes to be assessed are the severity of anxiety symptoms, experiential avoidance, QoL and depression biomarkers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval of this study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM/JEPeM/PP/23050420). The findings of the study will be published in academic peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05812001 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Registered on 12 April 2023.",

The clinical management of gout is mostly drug-based, and other treatment options are often ignored. This research proposal will explore whether exergames combined with ice therapy can help patients with gout to lose weight, relieve pain, improve the range of movement, improve quality of life, decrease uric acid level, decrease kinesiophobia and improve mental health of patients with gout. METHODS: This experiment will use a two-arm randomized controlled design. The study setting is at the Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (AMDI), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). Obese patients with gout (N = 30) will be randomly assigned to the control group (receive an exergames intervention) and intervention group (receive an exergames intervention combined with ice therapy). The outcomes measurement will be conducted before (baseline) and after intervention (4 weeks). Then, it will be followed up at 12 weeks. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of exergames and ice therapy among gout patients. This study is expected to demonstrate that exercise rehabilitation facilitated by exergames with ice therapy is more effective in gout management compared to a conventional rehabilitation intervention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA statement. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched in Pubmed, Scopus, WoS, CINAHL, and PEDro (inception to November 2023). Studies that applied non-immersive exergames and assessed physical, functional, cognitive, pain, and psychosocial outcomes were included. Comparisons were other exercise modalities and non-intervention. Methodological quality was assessed with PEDro scale, and risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with Cochrane RoB-2 tool. RESULTS: Eight studies were included (total of participants = 401). The mean PEDro score was 6.1, and seven studies had high RoB. Seven studies involved knee OA and one cervical OA. The most frequent duration for interventions was four weeks. Exergames were more effective than controls in at least one outcome in all studies. The outcomes for which exergames were most effective were functional disability, postural balance, muscle strength, proprioception, gait, range of motion, pain, quality of life, depression, and kinesiophobia. CONCLUSION: Non-immersive exergames constitute an effective strategy for optimizing several relevant outcomes in rehabilitation. However, more RCTs with high methodological quality are required to deepen the knowledge about the multidimensional effects of exergames in OA patients.",

METHODS: PubMed, SCOPUS and CINAHL Plus databases were searched from January 2007 to August 2023. Studies considered eligible for inclusion had to report one or more of the following outcomes: functional capacity (e.g. VO 2 max), quality of life, mortality, hospital admissions, physical activity level, and engagement/satisfaction of the intervention. Only studies reported in English were included. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for their eligibility. RESULTS: Two studies (in four reports) were included. Included studies reported only data on functional capacity (6-min walking test) and on physical activity level (accelerometers). Due to the low number of included studies, no meta-analysis was performed, and results were discussed narratively. CONCLUSION: Exergames may potentially be a promising tool for exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure; however, the low number of included studies was insufficient to drawn proper conclusions. Benefits of exergames compared with traditional interventions could be the possibility of it being delivered at home, reducing some of the barriers that patients with heart failure must face. Further studies are required to assess the efficacy of exergame interventions in patients with heart failure, and to define proper guidelines to deliver exergame interventions in this population.This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023446948).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many senior adults are at risk of mental and physical disorders due to a lack of sufficient exercise. Therefore, adherent exercise should be urgently promoted to improve senior adults' muscle strength, preventing falls and conditions caused by physical and cognitive decline. However, off-the-shelf exercise games, so-called exergames, are mainly targeted at the younger generation or children, while senior adults are neglected, when this age group strongly needs exercise. Exergames could serve as a health intervention for promoting exercise. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate senior adults' experience, perceptions, and acceptance of game technology to promote exercise in order to suggest game design guidelines. METHODS: In this usability study, participants engaged in playing Nintendo Switch and Xbox Kinect games, after which semistructured interviews were conducted. Before the gameplay, the participants provided their background information, exercise habits, and use of technology products. Next, all participants completed a workshop including 3 activities (brief instructions on how to play the games: 20 minutes; playing the selected exergames: 80 minutes; semistructured interviews: 20 minutes) for 2 hours a day for 3 days each. The participants played the latest Nintendo Switch games (eg, Just Dance, Boxing, Ring Fit Adventure) and Xbox Kinect games (eg, Kinect Adventures!, Mini Games). Just Dance, Zumba, and Boxing were played in activity 1; Ring Fit Adventure and Mini Games in activity 2; and Kinect Adventures! in activity 3. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied to identify the relative themes generated from the interviews. RESULTS: In total, 22 participants (mean age 70.4, SD 6.1 years) were enrolled in the workshop in May 2021. The results of the generated themes included incomprehension of game instructions, psychological perception of game technology, and game art preferences. The subthemes generated from game art preferences included favorite game genres, characters, and scenes. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant need for customized game tutorials considering senior adults' cognitive and physical aging. Furthermore, the adventure game genre is preferable to other games. Humanlike game characters are preferable, especially those with a fit and healthy body shape. Nature scenes are more enjoyable than indoor stages or rooms. Furthermore, the game intensity design and playing time should be carefully planned to meet the World Health Organization's criteria for physical activity in older adults. Intelligent recommendation systems might be helpful to support older adults with various health conditions. The guidelines suggested in this study might be beneficial for game design, exercise training, and game technology adoption of exergames for older adults to improve health."

METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The PubMed, Ovid, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant studies from inception until June 1, 2023. The reviewers independently completed the study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the sources of between-study heterogeneity and to determine whether participant or intervention characteristics influenced effect sizes. RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for qualitative and quantitative synthesis. The overall methodological quality was relatively high, and the overall evidence grade was moderate. VR exergames had a large effect on physical function, including mobility [SMD=-0.66, P < 0.001], balance [SMD=0.95, P < 0.001], and lower limb strength [SMD=0.53, P = 0.0009]; and a moderate effect on cognition [SMD=0.48, P = 0.02] and depression [SMD=-0.72, P = 0.03]. Subgroup analyses revealed that a training frequency of 2 sessions per week and coordinating with physiotherapists yielded greater improvements in mobility (P = 0.009; P = 0.0001). VR exergames had especially beneficial effects on balance for physically fit participants (P = 0.03) and on cognition for participants with cognitive impairment (P = 0.01). Additionally, regarding the improvement of depression, commercial VR exergames were superior to self-made systems (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: VR exergames can provide a positive impact on physical function, cognition and depression among older nursing home residents. The study also demonstrated the different benefits of exergames between participants who were physically fit and those with cognitive impairment, which is considered as an innovative, cost-efficient and sustainable approach. Specifically, commercial VR exergame programs with a frequency of 2 sessions per week and coordinating with physiotherapists may be the most appropriate and effective option.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of exergame rehabilitation in improving independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and patient balance after abdominal cancer surgery. METHODS: A randomized control-group study was carried out in an oncological hospital in Portugal. Seventy postoperative patients were included, and data collection took place between January 2023 and May 2023. The patients were randomly assigned to either an exergame rehabilitation program (n = 35) or a traditional rehabilitation program (n = 35). The assessed outcomes were the Barthel and Berg scales, and data collection occurred at 3 different time points: admission, 48 hours postoperatively, and on the seventh day after surgery. RESULTS: At the third assessment, a statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups for both indicators, ADLs and balance. CONCLUSIONS: There was an improvement in ADLs and balance in the exergames group. By the seventh day after surgery, the intervention group showed improvement in balance and ADLs compared with the control group. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The use of exergames can be a solution to the challenges of traditional rehabilitation methods after abdominal surgery for cancer for postoperative patients.

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to December 7, 2023. Interventional studies using immersive or nonimmersive virtual reality platforms conducted on older adults ≥60 years old were eligible. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random effects model by pooling mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences. Outcomes were narratively synthesized when meta-analysis was not possible. RESULTS: Forty-three articles from 37 studies were included (n = 1 139 participants at baseline). Postintervention, dynamic balance measured using Berg Balance Scale (pooled MD = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.73-3.57, p < .0001), Timed-Up-and-Go times (pooled MD = -1.04, 95% CI: -2.06 to -0.03, p = .04), choice stepping reaction time (pooled MD = -92.48, 95% CI: -167.30 to -17.67, p = .02), and movement time (pooled MD = -50.33, 95% CI: -83.34 to -17.33, p = .003) were significantly better in the experimental group compared to the control group. Adherence ranged from 76.5% to 100%, whereas attrition ranged from 9.1% to 31.9%. Most participants completed the intervention with no or minimal adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Dance exergames are effective, feasible, usable, and safe for older adults. Further research is needed as the findings were limited by small sample sizes.

Home-based exergame training can be a solution to overcome physical inactivity. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of home-based exergame interventions and evaluate their effectiveness in improving cognitive and physical functions through physical activity enhancement in older adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a systematic literature search including studies examining (1) community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years and older without any specific disease, (2) exergame-based exercise programs that take place at least partially in a home setting, and (3) intervention-related physical and/or cognitive outcomes. We will include randomized controlled trials and any other type of pre-post study published in English. There are no restrictions in terms of control group type and publication date. A search string was created and used in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL. In addition, a hand search is carried out. This involves checking the references of the included studies and searching Google Scholar for further studies. The included studies will be summarized and, if homogeneity is sufficient, a random-effects meta-analysis will be performed. We will assess the risk of bias using RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I. CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review will help to define the most suitable exergame programs to counteract cognitive and physical decline in older adults. Additionally, they will inform the development of effective home-based exergame systems and point to future pathways of digital rehabilitation in older adults.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the early 2000s, there has been a growing interest in using exercise video games (exergames) and virtual reality (VR)-based interventions as innovative methods to enhance physical rehabilitation for individuals with multiple disabilities. Over the past decade, researchers and exercise professionals have focused on developing specialized immersive exercise video games for various populations, including those who have experienced a stroke, revealing tangible benefits for upper limb rehabilitation. However, it is necessary to develop highly engaging, personalized games that can facilitate the creation of experiences aligned with the preferences, motivations, and challenges communicated by people who have had an episode of stroke. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to explore the customization potential of an exergame for individuals who have undergone a stroke, concurrently evaluating its usability as a technological tool in the realm of physical therapy and rehabilitation. METHODS: We introduce a playtest methodology to enhance the design of a VR exergame developed using a user-centered approach for upper limb rehabilitation in stroke survivors. Over 4 playtesting sessions, stroke survivors interacted with initial game versions using VR headsets, providing essential feedback for refining game content and mechanics. Additionally, a pilot study involving 10 stroke survivors collected data through VR-related questionnaires to assess game design aspects such as mechanics, assistance, experience, motion sickness, and immersion. RESULTS: The playtest methodology was beneficial for improving the exergame to align with user needs, consistently incorporating their perspectives and achieving noteworthy results. The pilot study revealed that users had a positive response. In the first scenario, a carpenter presents a game based on the flexion-extension movement of the elbow; the second scenario includes a tejo game (a traditional Colombian throwing game) designed around game mechanics related to the flexion-extension movement of the shoulder; and in the third scenario, a farmer challenges the player to perform a movement combining elbow flexion and extension with internal and external rotation of the shoulder. These findings suggest the potential of the studied exergame as a tool for the upper limb rehabilitation of individuals who have experienced a stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of exergames in rehabilitation for stroke-induced hemiparesis has significantly benefited the recovery process by focusing on essential shoulder and elbow movements. These interactive games play a crucial role in helping users regain mobility and restore practical use of affected limbs. They also serve as valuable data sources for researchers, improving the system's responsiveness. This iterative approach enhances game design and markedly boosts user satisfaction, suggesting exergames have promising potential as adjunctive elements in traditional therapeutic approaches."

AIM: This study aims to investigate the effects of innovative games particularly designed for neurological patients on upper extremity performance, trunk mobility and cognition in patients with PD. METHOD: Twenty-three patients were enrolled in this randomized controlled study and randomly allocated into two groups: Exergames Program (EP) and Conventional Exercise Program (CP). Both groups received supervised physiotherapy sessions for 3 days a week and 8 weeks in total (24 sessions). Each session lasted 1 h. Evaluations were applied before and after the treatment: 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT), Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Reach Test (FRT), and Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). RESULTS: Twenty patients were included in the analysis because of the dropouts. Our findings showed that both groups improved significantly in 9-HPT dominant side, MMDT, TIS, MDS-UPDRS, TUG, FRT, and PDQ-39 (p < 0.05). MoCA scores of EP group improved significantly (p < 0.05) while CP group's did not (p > 0.05). It was found that EP group had better improvements in 9-HPT dominant side, MMDT turning test, and MoCA than CP group when the differences in the changes within the groups were compared (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Game-based training can be a useful rehabilitation tool to improve upper extremities performance, trunk mobility, cognition, functional mobility, balance, and quality of life and may have superiority over conventional exercises in improving cognition and upper extremity functions.

This article explores the benefits of exergames in improving cognitive function in older adults through a literature review, with aim of contributing to the development of healthy aging. METHODS: Using PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, dimensional spectrum, search for research papers from 2005 to April 2023 by using keywords such as a somatosensory game, cognitive function, execute function, working memory, aged and suppression control. PEDro Scale was used to check the quality of the literature. RESULTS: A total of 16 papers were included in the review. Exergames improve the executive function of the elderly and support the relationship between exergames and cognitive performance in older adults. From a mechanistic perspective, somatosensory play promotes signal transduction of brain neurotrophin, thereby protecting the structure and function of neurons in specific brain regions and delays the decline of executive function in older adults as much as possible. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended to use exergames as an intervention measure for the physical and mental health preservation of older adults. Suggest adopting personalised exergames in the future to explore the impact of cognitive and physical functions in elderly people, as well as measurable changes in brain structure.",

      "abstract": "Serious Exergames (SEGs) have been little concerned with flexibility/equivalence, complementarity, and monitoring (functionalities of systems that deal with a wide variety of inputs). These functionalities are necessary for health SEGs due to the variety of treatments and measuring requirements. No known SEG architectures include these three functionalities altogether. In this paper, we present the 123-SGR software architecture for the creation of an SEG that is appropriate to the needs of professionals and patients in the area of rehabilitation. An existing SEG was adapted and therapy-related sensor devices (Pneumotachograph, Manovacuometer, Pressure Belt, and Oximeter) were built to help the patient interact with the SEG. The architecture allows the most varied input combinations, with and without fusion, and these combinations are possible for both conscious and unconscious signals. Health and Technology professionals have assessed the SEG and found that it had the functionalities of flexibility/equivalence, complementarity, and monitoring, and that these are really important and necessary functionalities. The 123-SGR architecture can be used as a blueprint for future SEG development.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a 12-week training program with Dance Exergames on the mood and functional fitness profile of elderly women. METHODS: The sample (n = 22) was divided into Exergames (EG, n = 9, 70.6 ± 1.6 years) and Control Groups (CG, n = 13, 73.6 ± 2.2 years). Evaluations were carried out before and after the interventions. Each participant played, in pairs, the electronic game Dance Central 3, with the XBOX 360 Kinect console (Slim, Microsoft, USA). The EG trained for 12 weeks (24 sessions), with two weekly sessions of 50 min and the CG performed manual activities workshops. RESULTS: In functional fitness, both exercise training with exergame (EG) and the intervention model for the CG did not produce significant effects regarding interaction (group*time). Mood state presented significant effect of time intervention regarding tension (p = <0.001), depression (p = 0.001), anger (p = 0.030), fatigue (p = 0.001), and mental confusion (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of training with a dance exergame (for, EG) and manual activities (for, CG) is enough to promote improvements in the mood state of healthy elderly women. This is an interesting result, as it shows that social interaction is as important a component as improving functional capacity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exergames are promising exercise tools for improving health. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has compared the effects of commercial exergames and conventional exercises on improving executive functions (EFs) in children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of commercial exergames and conventional exercises on improving EFs in children and adolescents. METHODS: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, 5 randomized controlled trial (RCT) databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus) were searched from their inception to July 7, 2022, to identify relevant RCTs. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias for each study. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to evaluate the overall quality of evidence. RESULTS: In total, 8 RCTs including 435 children and adolescents were included in the analysis. Commercial exergames had no significant benefit on overall EFs compared to conventional exercises (Hedges g=1.464, 95% CI -0.352 to 3.280; P=.06). For core EFs, there was no evidence to suggest that commercial exergames are more beneficial for improving cognitive flexibility (g=0.906, 95% CI -0.274 to 2.086; P=.13), inhibitory control (g=1.323, 95% CI -0.398 to 3.044; P=.13), or working memory (g=2.420, 95% CI -1.199 to 6.038; P=.19) than conventional exercises. We rated the evidence for overall EFs, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, and working memory as being of very low quality due to inconsistency (large heterogeneity) and imprecision (low number of people). Additionally, no effects of the intervention were observed in the acute and chronic groups. CONCLUSIONS: We do not have strong evidence to support the benefit of commercial exergaming on EFs because we did not observe a Hedges g close to 0 with tight CIs. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42022324111; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=324111."

The design of this study involved the collection of physiological and perceptual responses (i.e., heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion, and enjoyment score) during exergames in three different sports (bowling, tennis, and boxing) with players in different positions (sitting and standing). The participants played each game for 10 min while their HR was recorded. After the gameplay, each perceptual response was retrieved. The results revealed a significant increase in HR above rest during exergaming overall (p < 0.001). Standing gameplay resulted in a significantly higher HR (p < 0.001) than seated gameplay. Compared to tennis and bowling, boxing produced the highest physiological response (p < 0.001) and perceived exertion (p < 0.05) in both positions. The participants perceived all the sports exergames to be enjoyable, as their enjoyment scores did not significantly differ for each game (p > 0.5). For all the variables, no statistically significant differences between genders were identified (p > 0.5). This home-based intervention demonstrated that sports exergames are not only enjoyable; overall, they can provide at least moderately intense physical activity, whether played seated or standing."

Materials and Methods: Fifty independent older adults were randomly assigned to CPT and exergames (CPT+ExG group; n = 25; age = 71.8 ± 6.8 years) or CPT alone (CPT group; n = 25; age = 71.3 ± 7.4 years). CPT was performed twice a week (60 min/session) for 8 weeks. The CPT+ExG group added exergames for 30 minutes in each session. The Senior Fitness Test was applied, considering the 30-second chair stand test as the primary outcome. Additionally, dynamometric muscle performance during the STS maneuver was assessed. Results: The CPT+ExG group improved the 30-second chair stand (lower body strength), back scratch (upper body flexibility), and 8-foot up-and-go (agility/dynamic balance) tests (all P < 0.05). Both groups improved the kinetic dynamometric variables peak force, peak power, and total work (all P < 0.05). Also, both groups improved the 30-second arm curl test (upper body strength) (P < 0.05), although the increase was higher in the CPT+ExG group compared with the CPT group (time × group; P < 0.05). Conclusion: Adding exergames to a CPT program only significantly increases upper limb strength compared with CPT alone. The findings of this study have implications for the design of future exergame interventions focused on improving STS maneuver performance in older adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dual-task training in Parkinson's disease (PD) improves spatiotemporal gait parameters, cognition, and quality of life. Virtual reality (VR) has been used as a therapeutic tool for patients to participate in activities in a safe environment, engage in multisensory experiences, and improve motivation and interest in rehabilitation. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of fully immersive VR exergames with dual-task components in patients with PD. METHODS: We developed VR exergames (go/no-go punch game, go/no-go stepping game, and number punch game) to improve habitual behavior control using motor-cognitive dual-task performance in patients with PD. The participants underwent 10 sessions 2-3 times a week, consisting of 30 min per session. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Timed Up and Go test (TUG) under single- and dual-task (cognitive and physical) conditions, Berg balance scale (BBS), Stroop test, trail-making test, and digit span were evaluated before and after intervention. The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was used to assess VR cybersickness. Usability was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled and completed the entire training session. The mean age of participants was 73.83 ± 6.09 years; mean disease duration was 128.83 ± 76.96 months. The Hoehn and Yahr stages were 2.5 in seven patients and 3 in five patients. A significant improvement was observed in BBS and Stroop color-word test (p = 0.047 and p = 0.003, respectively). TUG time and dual-task interferences showed positive changes, but these changes were not statistically significant. The median SSQ total score was 28.05 (IQR: 29.92), 13.09 (IQR: 11.22), and 35.53 (IQR: 52.36) before, after the first session, and after the final session, respectively; the differences were not significant. Overall satisfaction with the intervention was 6.0 (IQR: 1.25) on a 7-point Likert-type scale. CONCLUSIONS: Fully immersive VR exergames combined with physical and cognitive tasks may be used for rehabilitation of patients with PD without causing serious adverse effects. Furthermore, the exergames using dual-task components improved executive function and balance. Further development of VR training content may be needed to improve motor and dual-task performances.

We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, and Embase up to January 2023. Initially, 52,294 records were screened. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 studies were included in this systematic review. Meta-analyses revealed statistically significant reductions in the risk of falls and improvements in balance. Exergaming tended to produce positive benefits according to the results obtained using different instruments (TUG, PPA, BBS, and others), control groups, and times of intervention. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of studies exhibited a high risk of bias and only one had a long follow-up period. Although a large body of evidence supports the view that exergaming is suitable for reducing fall risk and improving balance in older adults, some gaps remain in our knowledge about such benefits."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a condition that imposes a significant disease burden, with cognitive impairment being one of its costly symptoms. While cognitive rehabilitation is crucial, it is also challenging. Although some studies have investigated the impact of exergames on cognitive function improvement, these have primarily focused on the elderly population, with limited attention given to individuals with depression. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the effects of exergames on cognitive functions in adolescents with depression and compare the effectiveness of exergames with traditional exercise. METHOD: The present investigation is a single-center randomized controlled trial that employs the ANOVA method to calculate the sample size using G*Power software, assuming a 25% dropout rate. The study enrolls fifty-four eligible patients with depression who are randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: the exergames group, which receives standard treatment and exergames intervention; the exercise group, which receives standard treatment and traditional exercise intervention; and the control group, which receives standard treatment exclusively. The study provides a comprehensive regimen of 22 supervised exercise and exergame sessions over an 8-week period, with a frequency of twice per week for the initial two weeks and three times per week for the subsequent six weeks. The researchers gather cognitive, mood, and sleep metrics at the onset of the first week, as well as at the conclusion of the fourth and eighth weeks. The researchers employ a wearable device to track participants' heart rate during each intervention session and evaluate the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale at the conclusion of each session. DISCUSSION: The findings from this study make several contributions to the current literature. First, this study comprehensively reports the efficacy of an exergames intervention for multidimensional symptoms in adolescents with depression. Second, this study also compares the efficacy of exergames with that of traditional exercise. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of exergames as an adjunctive intervention for depression and lay the groundwork for future research.

      "abstract": "Exergames are defined as digital games that require bodily movements to play, stimulating an active gaming experience to function as a form of physical activity (PA). The players interact with the game through whole-body movements improving energy expenditure. Exergames may be effective in improving physical and psychological aspects of children and adolescents with obesity. In this narrative review, we synthesized the current evidence regarding the role of exergames in modifying body composition and weight and in promoting changes in sedentary behavior to define the benefits of active video games as useful tools for fighting sedentarism and to outline the future directions of exergaming as a supplementation exercise rather than a replacement in educational programs for pediatric obesity. Data from the literature indicate that exergames may offer an interesting impact on childhood obesity and may be considered a potential strategy for controlling weight gain and body composition, promote PA, and decrease time spent on sedentary behavior in children and adolescents with obesity. However, exergame use also has some limits, such as children's poor self-regulation and poor structuring of exergame use. Therefore, a prudent approach should be maintained, and additional high-quality research is needed to determine if exergames can be effectively used in the treatment of childhood obesity and if new digital media, as a supplementation of exercise rather than a replacement, could be considered to combat sedentary behavior in educational programs for pediatric obesity prevention."

This study aims at conducting a systematic review about the use and the efficacy of digital games in pediatric neurorehabilitation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In accordance with the PRISMA approach, a rather wide-ranging search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases by using different combinations of keywords based on MeSH terms. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fifty-five papers have been included into this review, namely, 38 original studies and 17 reviews. The total number of children and adolescents is 573, with 58% of them being affected by cerebral palsy. Despite a wide variability in the adopted protocols, devices, assessment tools, and a more frequent focus on motor aspects than on cognitive ones, the results of the majority of the analyzed studies support the safety (i.e., absence of severe adverse effects) and efficacy of the videogame-based therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Videogames, when administered by means of commercial consoles or ad-hoc digital systems, seem to be a valid support for physical therapy. Further researchers are needed to deeply investigate the role of this approach in cognitive therapy and cognitive outcomes.",

Materials and Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial pretest-posttest including 36 children with DD who were allocated to the cooperative exergame group (CGG), competitive exergame group (CmGG), and solitary exergame group (SGG). The exergame program was performed two times a week for 8 weeks and the outcome measurements were conducted before and after the program. A paired sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the changes within and between the groups. Results: The result indicated a significant improvement in memory, attention, and visual perception in all groups; the CGG and CmGG showed a high increase in attention compared with the SGG. However, only the CGG presented a significant improvement in the language subscale. In terms of anxiety, only the CGG presented substantial improvements in all anxiety subscales. The CmGG showed improvement in social phobia and the SGG in physical injury fears, social phobia, and general anxiety fears. Conclusion: The findings suggest that cooperative and competitive exergames may be used to effectively improve cognitive functions; cooperative exergames can be applied as the most effective method to reduce anxiety compared with the other game types for children with DD.",

Combined, multi-dimensional and interactive programs appear to be relevant. On one hand, for the characteristics to be implemented in the physical dimension of a program, multimodal interventions stimulating the aerobic pathway and muscle strengthening during the solicitation of gross motor activities, seem to be interesting. On the other hand, regarding the cognitive dimension of a program, complex and variable cognitive stimuli appear to hold the greatest promise for generating cognitive benefits and the broadest transfers to untrained tasks. The field of video games also brings interesting enrichment through the gamification of situations and the feeling of immersion. However, some gray areas remain to be clarified, notably the ideal response dose, the balance between physical and cognitive solicitation and the programs' customization."

Methods: A 12-week randomized controlled trial was conducted. Quality of life was measured using the short-form 36-item version (SF-36) scale. All the participants were between 20 and 24 years old in Taiwan. Participants in the intervention group (n = 55) were asked to play exergames for 12 weeks, three times a week and 30 minutes at a time, while participants in the control group (n = 62) did not play exergames. The changes in the scores on quality of life between the beginning and the end of the 12-week trial were calculated. Independent t-tests were used to analyze the differences. Results: The intervention group participants experienced an enhanced quality of life in terms of physical functioning, role-physical (role limitations due to physical health), general health, and social functioning. Moreover, the intervention group participants who were not enthusiastic about exercisers experienced an enhanced quality of life in physical functioning, role-physical, and general health. The intervention group participants who attempted to control their weight experienced enhanced general health, vitality, and mental health. Conclusion: Playing exergaming could contribute to users' quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson`s disease (PD) often suffer from both motor and cognitive impairments. Simultaneous motor and cognitive training stimulates neurobiological processes which are important especially for people with PD. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and effects of simultaneous cognitive-motor training in form of exergames in the setting of inpatient rehabilitation of persons with PD. METHODS: Forty participants (72.4 ± 9.54 years; Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-4) were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which trained five times a week in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, or the control group, which underwent the standard rehabilitation treatment only. Primary outcome was feasibility (measured by adherence rate, attrition rate, occurrence of adverse events, system usability scale (SUS), and NASA TLX score). In addition, various cognitive (Go/No-Go test, reaction time test (RTT), color word interference test (D-KEFS) and Trail Making Test A and B (TMT)) and motor (preferred gait speed, maximum gait speed, dual-task gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and 5 times Sit-to-Stand (5xStS)) tests were conducted before and after the intervention phase in order to determine training effects RESULTS: Adherence rate was 97%, there were just two dropouts due to reasons unrelated to the study and there were no adverse events. The mean NASA TLX value was 56.2 and the mean value of the SUS was 76.7. Significant time-group interaction effects were observed for the 5xStS, the SPPB, the RTT, the Go/No-Go test and the D-KEFS 2. DISCUSSION: Exergaming, as applied in this study, showed to be feasible, safe and likely effective for the improvement of cognitive and motor functions of PD inpatients. Because of this future randomized controlled trials with a main focus on testing the efficacy of this new intervention are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04872153).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We developed the Blexer system consisting of a database and a web interface for therapists that can host different types of adaptive and personally configurable virtual reality exergames based on Kinect (Microsoft Corp) motion capture to provide entertaining exercises for children with motor disabilities. It allows for parameter adjustment and the monitoring of results remotely, thereby providing a useful tool to complement traditional physical therapy sessions with home exercises. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to observe the motor benefits achieved through the use of a video exergame and the importance and implications of correctly setting the game's difficulty parameters. METHODS: This was an observational case study of 6 children with different physical disabilities receiving physical therapy at school combined with the use of a fully configurable exergame under research that forms a part of the Blexer environment. The game integrates 4 repeatedly appearing upper limb exercises with individually adjustable difficulties (intermittent arm rising, arm forward and backward movement, rising and holding of one arm, and trunk control in all directions). The outcomes were 3 assessments of 2 efficacy measures: Box and Block Test and Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. RESULTS: A total of 5 children with cerebral palsy (mean 8.4, SD 2.7 years; Gross Motor Function Classification II-2/5, 40%; III-2/5, 40%; and IV-1/5, 20%) and 1 child with obstetric brachial plexus palsy (aged 8 years; Mallet Classification III) received between 8 and 11 sessions of training (10-20 minutes per session), depending on age, motivation, and fatigue. Significant associations were observed between game parameter settings and improvements in motor function, on the one hand, and between the type of improvement and disability severity, on the other: with adjusted game parameters goal and time in the range of 70% to 100%, only less affected children improved in the Box and Block Test (+11 blocks vs -1 block), and more affected children improved more in the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (+90 seconds vs +27 seconds). CONCLUSIONS: When defining the difficulty parameters for an exergame, we suggest a classification in levels ranging from very easy to very hard. For practical use, we suggest setting the difficulty for the player to an easy or medium level rather than high-commitment goals, as this leads to a longer playtime with more fun and, therefore, seems to improve the results of the game and, consequently, mobility."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical activity leads to improvements in morbidity, mortality, and quality of life, especially when it is progressive, challenging, and regular. There is strong evidence that strength and balance exercises decrease the risk of falling. However, traditional exercises may be tedious and not very motivating for participants. Exergames have been found to increase engagement and enjoyment for older users. OBJECTIVE: This study will conduct a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the use of MIRA Rehab Exergames among older male residents in a care home setting in Saudi Arabia. A sample of 30 eligible participants will be recruited to meet feasibility study requirements. METHODS: We will recruit 38 residents in the care home who will be randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group. The intervention participants will perform gamified exercises using the MIRA telerehabilitation platform (30 minutes 3 times per week for 6 weeks). The control group will receive educational advice based on booklets of the Otago exercise program and be encouraged to exercise (30 minutes 3 times per week for 6 weeks). Participants will be assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12. Assessments will include feasibility measures (eligibility, recruitment and attrition rates, and practicalities of data collection methods) and participant outcome measures (balance, strength, mobility, adherence, quality of life, fear of falling, depression, acceptability, and usability). RESULTS: Data collection started in November 2021 and ended in March 2022. The study is currently in the data analysis stage, which commenced in May 2022. The findings from this feasibility RCT will be used to design a definitive RCT to test whether the MIRA Rehab Exergame program benefits older people in Saudi Arabia who may not like participating in traditional exercise programs and may be unwilling or unable to leave their homes. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to our understanding of how to recruit in this specific population and provide information to inform the design of a future RCT.

Recently, virtual reality and exergaming have been emerged as promising tools for gait and balance rehabilitation in PD patients. Our purpose is to evaluate an innovative treatment for older patients with PD, based on non-immersive virtual reality exergames, improving gait and balance and reducing falling risk. (2) Methods: Thirty PD patients were recruited and randomly divided into two groups, to receive a traditional rehabilitation (CG) or a technological rehabilitation (TG). (3) Results: A statistical improvement of balance at the end of treatments was observed in both groups (CG: 12.4 ± 0.7 vs. 13.5 ± 0.8, p = 0.017; TG: 13.8 ± 0.5 vs. 14.7 ± 0.4, p = 0.004), while the overall risk of falling was significantly reduced only in the TG (POMA Total: 24.6 ± 0.9 vs. 25.9 ± 0.7, p = 0.010). The results between groups shows that all POMA scores differ in a statistically significant manner in the TG, emphasizing improvement not only in balance but also in gait characteristics (9.7 ± 0.8 vs. 11.4 ± 0.2, p = 0.003). Moreover, TG also improves the psychological sphere, measured thorough MSC-(17.1 ± 0.4 vs. 16.5 ± 0.4, p = 0.034). Although an improvement in FES-I and Gait Speed can be observed, this increase does not turn out to be significant.

This aims to provide a tool that can be individually tailored and adapted to people with different needs, making it applicable to different diseases and states of disease. The game is based on motion capturing and integrates four example exercises that can be configured via our therapeutic web platform \"Blexer-med\". To prove the feasibility for a wide range of different users, evaluation tests were performed on 14 patients with various types and degrees of neuromuscular disorders, classified into three groups based on strength and autonomy. The users were free to choose their schedule and frequency. The game scores and three surveys (before, during, and after the intervention) showed similar experiences for all groups, with the most vulnerable having the most fun and satisfaction. The players were motivated by the story and by achieving high scores. The average usage time was 2.5 times per week, 20 min per session. The pure exercise time was about half of the game time. The concept has proven feasible and forms a reasonable basis for further developments. The full 3D exercise needs further fine-tuning to enhance the fun and motivation."

      "abstract": "Combining physical, motor, and cognitive exercises is expected to be effective to attenuate age-related declines of brain and cognition in older adults. This can be achieved either by conventional interventions or by exergames. This paper aimed to determine whether conventional combined training and exergame interventions are two comparable ways for delivering combined training. In total, 24 studies on conventional training and 23 studies on exergames were selected and compared. A common framework was used to analyze both types of combined training interventions. Our analysis showed that conventional combined training interventions were more effective than separated physical and motor training to improve brain and cognition, while their superiority over cognitive training alone remains to be confirmed. Exergames scarcely led to cognitive benefits superior to those observed after physical, motor, or cognitive training alone. Thus, although both conventional training interventions and exergames allowed delivering combined training programs, they are not two facets of the same coin. Further studies that are more theoretically grounded are necessary to determine whether interventions delivered via exergames may lead to superior benefits compared to conventional separated and combined training interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Canada, stroke survivors have difficulty accessing community-based rehabilitation services because of a lack of resources. VirTele, a personalized remote rehabilitation program combining virtual reality exergames and telerehabilitation, was developed to provide stroke survivors an opportunity to pursue rehabilitation of their chronic upper extremity (UE) deficits at home while receiving ongoing follow-up from a clinician. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the behavioral and motivational techniques used by clinicians during the VirTele intervention, explore the indicators of empowerment among stroke survivors, and investigate the determinants of VirTele use among stroke survivors and clinicians. METHODS: This multiple case study involved 3 stroke survivors with chronic UE deficits and their respective clinicians (physiotherapists) who participated in the VirTele intervention, a 2-month remote rehabilitation intervention that uses nonimmersive virtual reality exergames and telerehabilitation aimed at improving UE deficits in stroke survivors. Study participants had autonomous access to Jintronix exergames and were asked to use them for 30 minutes, 5 times a week. The VirTele intervention included 1-hour videoconference sessions with a clinician 1 to 3 times a week, during which the clinician engaged in motivational interviewing, supervised the stroke survivors' use of the exergames, and monitored their use of the affected UE through activities of daily living. Semidirected interviews were conducted with the clinicians and stroke survivors 4 to 5 weeks after the end of the VirTele intervention. All interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. An abductive thematic analysis was conducted to generate new ideas through a dynamic interaction between data and theory. RESULTS: Three stroke survivors (n=2, 67%, women and n=1, 33%, man), with a mean age of 58.8 (SD 19.4) years, and 2 physiotherapists participated in the study. Five major determinants of VirTele use emerged from the qualitative analyses, namely technology performance (usefulness and perception of exergames), effort (ease of use), family support (encouragement), facilitators (considerations of the stroke survivors' safety as well as trust and understanding of instructions), and challenges (miscommunication and exergame limits). During the VirTele intervention, both clinicians used motivational and behavioral techniques to support autonomy, competence, and connectivity. All these attributes were reflected as empowerment indicators in the stroke survivors. Lessons learned from using telerehabilitation combined with exergames are provided, which will be relevant to other researchers and contexts. CONCLUSIONS: This multiple case study provides a first glimpse into the impact that motivational interviewing can have on adherence to exergames and changes in behavior in the use of the affected UE in stroke survivors. Lessons learned regarding the supportive role caregivers play and the new responsibilities clinicians have when using the VirTele intervention may inform the use of exergames via telerehabilitation. These lessons will also serve as a model to guide the implementation of similar interventions. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/14629."

This research questionnaire was adapted from a previous study and modified with an additional section to assess high school students' exergames experiences. Content validity, construct validity, and reliability was verified using different tests. Only one item (slimming tea and other drugs could be used in place of exercise to achieve the same effects) did not reach the required level of content validity index in terms of their relevance, clarity, simplicity, and ambiguity. Therefore, this item was removed from the instrument. For factor analysis, three questions were removed from the instrument due to those questions having a factor loading lower than 0.4. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient values for the test-retest reliability after an interval of two weeks for all questions were > 0.7. Kappa coefficient ranges between 0.67-0.96. The SME value ranged from 0.34 to 1.47. Repeated measured ANOVA did not reveal any significant differences between the test and re-test. This questionnaire has strong validity and reliability that can be used to measure high school student's knowledge, attitude, and practice about exercise and their exergames experiences.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is limited understanding of how older adults can reach kinematic goals in rehabilitation while performing exergames and conventional exercises, and how similar or different the kinematics during exergaming are when compared with conventional therapeutic exercise with similar movement. The aim of this study was to describe the movement characteristics performed during exercise in custom-designed exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises among patients who have undergone unilateral total knee replacement (TKR). In addition, the secondary aim was to assess the relation of these exercise methods, and to assess participants' perceived exertion and knee pain during exergaming and exercising. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients up to 4 months after the TKR surgery were invited in a single-visit exercise laboratory session. A 2D motion analysis and force plates were employed to evaluate movement characteristics as the volume, range, and intensity of movement performed during custom-designed knee extension-flexion and weight shifting exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises post TKR. The perceived exertion and knee pain were assessed using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion and Visual Analog Scale, respectively. RESULTS: Evaluation of seven patients with TKR [age median (IQR), 65 (10) years] revealed that the volume and intensity of movement were mostly higher during exergames. Individual goniometer-measured knee range of motion were achieved either with exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises, especially in knee extension exercises. The perceived exertion and knee pain were similar after exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises. CONCLUSIONS: During custom-designed exergaming the patients with TKR achieve the movement characteristics appropriate for post-TKR rehabilitation without increasing the stress and pain experienced even though the movement characteristics might be partly different from conventional therapeutic exercises by the volume and intensity of movement. Physical therapists could consider implementing such exergames in rehabilitation practice for patients with TKR once effectiveness have been approved and they are widely available."

The system integrates persuasive elements, adjusted when physiotherapists progress the therapeutic settings, such as the treadmill speed, auditory feedback, and game challenges. We followed a scenario-based design method to develop the system, which comprised an observational study of conventional GR sessions and evaluations with 6 and 9 rehabilitation specialists who provided feedback about the system design. They perceived that the proposed method was valuable for physiotherapists to adapt the rehabilitation based on the children's performance. Also, they remarked that the system's visual and auditory stimulus would help engage the children in the therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exergames are increasingly being used among survivors of stroke with chronic upper extremity (UE) sequelae to continue exercising at home after discharge and maintain activity levels. The use of virtual reality exergames combined with a telerehabilitation app (VirTele) may be an interesting alternative to rehabilitate the UE sequelae in survivors of chronic stroke while allowing for ongoing monitoring with a clinician. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the feasibility of using VirTele in survivors of chronic stroke at home and explore the impact of VirTele on UE motor function, quantity and quality of use, quality of life, and motivation in survivors of chronic stroke compared with conventional therapy. METHODS: This study was a 2-arm feasibility clinical trial. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group (receiving VirTele for 8 weeks) or a control group (receiving conventional therapy for 8 weeks). Feasibility was measured from the exergame and intervention logs completed by the clinician. Outcome measurements included the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-UE, Motor Activity Log-30, Stroke Impact Scale-16, and Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire-15, which were administered to both groups at four time points: time point 1 (T1; before starting the intervention), time point 2 (after the intervention), time point 3 (1 month after the intervention), and time point 4 (T4; 2 months after the intervention). RESULTS: A total of 11 survivors of stroke were randomized and allocated to an experimental or a control group. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, participants pursued the allocated treatment for 3 months instead of 8 weeks. VirTele intervention dose was captured in terms of time spent on exergames, frequency of use of exergames, total number of successful repetitions, and frequency of videoconference sessions. Technical issues included the loss of passwords, internet issues, updates of the system, and problems with the avatar. Overall, most survivors of stroke found the technology easy to use and useful, except for 9% (1/11) of participants. For the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-UE and Motor Activity Log-30, both groups exhibited an improvement in >50% of the participants, which was maintained over time (from time point 3 to T4). Regarding Stroke Impact Scale-16 scores, the control group reported improvement in activities of daily life (3/5, 60%), hand function (5/5, 100%), and mobility (2/5, 40%), whereas the experimental group reported varied and inconclusive results (from T1 to T4). For the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire-15, 75% (3/4) of the experimental group demonstrated an increase in the autonomous motivation score (from T1 to time point 2), whereas, in the control group, this improvement was observed in only 9% (1/11) of participants. CONCLUSIONS: The VirTele intervention constitutes another therapeutic alternative, in addition to conventional therapy, to deliver an intense personalized rehabilitation program for survivors of chronic stroke with UE sequelae.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the proven benefits of exercise in older adults, challenges such as access and motivation can deter their engagement. Interactive virtual reality (VR) games combined with exercise (exergames) are a plausible strategy to encourage physical activity among this population. However, there has been little research on the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefits of deploying at-home VR exergames among community-dwelling older adults. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to estimate the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a co-designed VR exergame in community-dwelling older adults; examine intervention feasibility and assessment protocols for a future large-scale trial; and provide pilot data on outcomes of interest (physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, mood, cognition, perception, and gameplay metrics). METHODS: The study will be a remote, 6-week intervention comprising an experimental and a control group. A sample of at least 12 community-dwelling older adults (with no or mild cognitive impairment) will be recruited for each group. Both groups will follow the same study procedures and assessment methods. However, the experimental group will engage with a co-designed VR exergame (Seas The Day) thrice weekly for approximately 20 minutes using the Oculus Quest 2 (Facebook Reality Labs) VR headset. The control group will read (instead of playing Seas The Day) thrice weekly for approximately 20 minutes over the 6-week period. A mixed methods evaluation will be used. Changes in physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, mood, cognition, and perception will be compared before and after acute data as well as before and after the 6 weeks between the experimental (exergaming) and control (reading) groups. Qualitative data from postintervention focus groups or interviews and informal notes and reports from all participants will be analyzed to assess the feasibility of the study protocol. Qualitative data from the experimental group will also be analyzed to assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of at-home VR exergames and explore perceived facilitators of and barriers to uptaking VR systems among community-dwelling older adults. RESULTS: The screening and recruitment process for the experimental group started in May 2021, and the data collection process will be completed by September 2021. The timeline of the recruitment process for the control group is September 2021 to December 2021. We anticipate an estimated adherence rate of ≥80%. Challenges associated with VR technology and the complexity of remote assessments are expected. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study will provide important information on the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a custom-made VR exergaming intervention to promote older adults' well-being. Findings from this study will be useful to inform the methodology, design, study procedures, and assessment protocol for future large-scale trials of VR exergames with older adults as well as deepen the understanding of remote deployment and at-home use of VR for exercise in older adults.

Moreover, it is still unknown whether they yield to equal or superior benefits as compared to other forms of physical exercise. However, until now, a review of exergaming literature was lacking, that would reverse the \"product first\" approach to replacing it with a \"training first\" approach that is, an analysis of the different studies based on a detailed description of the type of combined training interventions that was supported by the utilized exergames. In the present review, thanks to a structured framework build around seven interacting constructs (stimuli, settings, targets, markers, outcomes, moderators, and mechanisms), which collectively afford a global picture of the determining factors of exergames training, we aimed to determine whether and under which conditions exergames could be more effective than conventional training. Twenty three studies were finally selected for review and analyzed. We concluded that, in spite of their potential to improve brain and cognition, beneficial factors contributing to exergaming efficacy as well as its underlying mechanisms need to be investigated more systematically thanks to common experimental designs based on gold standards. We proposed some directions in this respect."

      "abstract": "A major concern of public health authorities is to also encourage adults to be exposed to enriched environments (sensory and cognitive-motor activity) during the pandemic lockdown, as was recently the case worldwide during the COVID-19 outbreak. Games for adults that require physical activity, known as exergames, offer opportunities here. In particular, the output of the gaming industry nowadays offers computer games with extended reality (XR) which combines real and virtual environments and refers to human-machine interactions generated by computers and wearable technologies. For example, playing the game in front of a computer screen while standing or walking on a force plate or treadmill allows the user to react to certain infrastructural changes and obstacles within the virtual environment. Recent developments, optimization, and minimizations in wearable technology have produced wireless headsets and sensors that allow for unrestricted whole-body movement. This makes the virtual experience more immersive and provides the opportunity for greater engagement than traditional exercise. Currently, XR serves as an umbrella term for current immersive technologies as well as future realities that enhance the experience with features that produce new controllable environments. Overall, these technology-enhanced exergames challenge the adult user and modify the experience by increasing sensory stimulation and creating an environment where virtual and real elements interact. As a therapy, exergames can potentially create new environments and visualizations that may be more ecologically valid and thus simulate real activities of daily living that can be trained. Furthermore, by adding telemedicine features to the exergame, progress over time can be closely monitored and feedback provided, offering future opportunities for cognitive-motor assessment. To more optimally serve and challenge adults both physically and cognitively over time in future lockdowns, there is a need to provide long-term remote training and feedback. Particularly related to activities of daily living that create opportunities for effective and lasting rehabilitation for elderly and sufferers from chronic non-communicable diseases (CNDs). The aim of the current review is to envision the remote training and monitoring of physical and cognitive aspects for adults with limited mobility (due to disability, disease, or age), through the implementation of concurrent telehealth and exergame features using XR and wireless sensor technologies."

      "abstract": "Background: Utilizing information technology (IT) systems, for example in form of computerized cognitive screening or exergame-based (also called active videogames) training, has gained growing interest for supporting healthy aging and to detect, prevent and treat neurocognitive disorders (NCD). To ameliorate the effectiveness of exergaming, the neurobiological mechanisms as well as the most effective components for exergame-based training remain to be established. At the same time, it is important to account for the end-users' capabilities, preferences, and therapeutic needs during the design and development process to foster the usability and acceptance of the resulting program in clinical practice. This will positively influence adherence to the resulting exergame-based training program, which, in turn, favors more distinct training-related neurobiological effects. Objectives and Methods: This methodological paper describes the design and development process of novel exergame-based training concepts guided by a recently proposed methodological framework: The 'Multidisciplinary Iterative Design of Exergames (MIDE): A Framework for Supporting the Design, Development, and Evaluation of Exergames for Health' (Li et al., 2020). Case Study: A step-by-step application of the MIDE-framework as a specific guidance in an ongoing project aiming to design, develop, and evaluate an exergame-based training concept with the aim to halt and/or reduce cognitive decline and improve quality of life in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorder (mNCD) is illustrated. Discussion and Conclusion: The development of novel exergame-based training concepts is greatly facilitated when it is based on a theoretical framework (e.g., the MIDE-framework). Applying this framework resulted in a structured, iterative, and evidence-based approach that led to the identification of multiple key requirements for the exergame design as well as the training components that otherwise may have been overlooked or neglected. This is expected to foster the usability and acceptance of the resulting exergame intervention in \"real life\" settings. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to implement a theoretical framework (e.g., the MIDE-framework) for future research projects in line with well-known checklists to improve completeness of reporting and replicability when serious games for motor-cognitive rehabilitation purposes are to be developed."

The hypothesis herein established is that an ultrafast neurophysiological adaptation occurs in prefrontal cortex of elderly after completion of a single exergames session. To reinforce the aforementioned hypothesis, individuals living in a Long-Term Care Home (LTCH) participated in the study and were randomly allocated into two groups (Virtual Reality Group, VRG, n = 5; and Active Control Group, ACG n = 5). VRG performed six exercises with exergames and ACG performed exercises with the same VRG movements but with no virtual reality. Assessment of frontal cortical activity at rest and during cognitive testing via electroencephalographic activity (EEG) was performed before and immediately after the intervention. Significant decrease in relative power of EEG (RPEEG) Beta brainwave (-29 ± 18%) in the left prefrontal cortex of VRG compared to ACG (4 ± 9%) (p = 0.007). A slight improvement on semantic fluency in VRG (ES=0.21) was noted. An ultrafast prefrontal cortical adaptation may occur as an effect of a single exergames session, causing a small improvement on cognition of institutionalized elderly."

The primary outcome was feasibility, as measured by e.g., adherence rate, attrition rate, occurrence of adverse events, System Usability Scale (SUS) and NASA-TLX score. Secondary outcomes included measures of physical and cognitive functioning such as comfortable walking speed, maximal walking speed, dual task walking speed, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Color-Word Interference test (D-KEFS), Trail Making test A and B (TMT), Go/No-Go test and Step Reaction Time test (SRTT). All secondary outcome measures were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: Thirty-nine persons were included in the study. Average adherence rate was 99%, there were no intervention-related dropouts and no adverse events. The mean System Usability Scale (SUS) score was 83.6 and the mean NASA-TLX score 45.5. Significant time-group interaction effects were found for the dual task walking speed, the Go/No-Go test and Step Reaction Time test (SRTT). Conclusion: Exergaming is a feasible, safe and effective cognitive-motor training approach in inpatient rehabilitation of geriatric patients. Incorporating exergaming in the rehabilitation program of geriatric patients offers potential to reduce fall risk factors and to increase patients' exercise motivation and rehabilitation success."

      "abstract": "Recently, exergames have been widely applied as exercise platforms among older adults. However, studies on the influence of exergames on older adults' physical activity remain scarce. The review article highlights the potential benefit of exergames as a physical activity tool for older adults. The literature search followed the PRISMA guidelines on databases PubMed (Public/Publisher MEDLINE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane, and Scopus. The literature included studies that evaluated the influence of exergames on older adults' physical activity. Articles were excluded if the mixed intervention was used, emphasizing specific limbs, improving specific tasks, or not mentioning intervention. The review article identified 25 studies that reported on 855 older adults 55 years of age and older. In addition, the common exergaming technology platforms examined were Microsoft Kinect™, Nintendo® Wii™, cybercycling, and interactive video dance games. Meanwhile, 11 studies used a pretest/post-test design and randomized controlled trial design in 14 studies. The review found that exergames significantly impacted the older adults' physical activity level as participants experienced improved balance and cognitive function, and enjoyed playing exergame, thus prolonging their game engagement. Although research on exergames is still new, current evidence showed a significant potential benefit of exergames as a physical activity tool for older adults. To overcome the limitation on various parameters that showed different effects and outcomes of exergames, the study recommends implementing randomized controlled trials with long-term observation using a mixed-method approach. Moreover, a multidisciplinary method involving exercise and neuromotor control experts could determine potential mechanisms of action that benefited from the exercises.",

METHODS: The rehabilitation program comprised different customised exergames and was delivered in 5 weekly sessions of 30 min for 4 weeks. Pre-, post-, and 1-month Follow-up assessments included the following metrics: Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), Posturography, and Gait analysis. RESULTS: We observed increased scores after the intervention of 9/72 points in GMF - Module E (Walk, Run and Jump) and of 9/56 points in BBS, sustained at Follow-up. Changes in function, specifically in the quality and independence of the performance of specific movements such as turning 360°, increased distance reaching forward, walk behind, step over obstacles, and step stairs up and down were also observed. Gait kinematics and Spatio-temporal parameters tended to get closer to the 50th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: We observed positive changes in motor function of a teenager with cerebral palsy, with sustained increased scores at a 1-month Follow-up. Findings are suggestive that intensive rehabilitation programs using exergames with high customisation features are a potentially valuable rehabilitation tool for training balance in teenagers with Cerebral Palsy.Implications for rehabilitationExergames may be a useful for providing balance training for teenagers who have a mixed form of cerebral palsy.Exergames that require body displacement may be suitable for modulating gait kinematics and spatio-temporal parameters.The customisation of virtual rehabilitation tools seems to impact the motivation and effort of the user positively.",

Materials and Methods: Community-dwelling older adults participated in a randomized controlled trial (N = 31) consisting of two weekly exercise sessions of 60 minutes for 12 weeks. Participants allocated to the exergames group (n = 15) had one individual session of exergames and one traditional exercise group session per week. Control group participants (n = 16) had two weekly traditional exercise group sessions. Outcome measures on fitness, balance, and health-related quality of life were measured at the start of the intervention, 6th, 12th, and 16th week (1-month follow-up). Results: The exergames group showed a significant increase in lower-body and upper-body strength from pre- to postintervention. When compared with control, participants had significantly higher developments of upper-body strength from pre- to postassessments. There was a significant decrease in shoulder range of motion between the end of the intervention and follow-up for participants in both conditions. Balance increased significantly during the intervention but decreased at follow-up in both conditions. The mental component of health-related quality of life was significantly higher at the end compared with the start of the intervention in the exergames group, and this difference was significantly higher when compared with control. Conclusion: Integrating personalized exergames designed for multidimensional fitness training in traditional settings can be an effective strategy to enhance older adults' motor performance and mental well-being.",

Exergames, an emerging tool in fall prevention, combine exercise with interactive and adaptive game elements. This review examines the extent to which exergame interventions reduce fear of falling among community-dwelling older adults. Method: Guided by the PRISMA methodology, we reviewed peer-reviewed studies that were published in English between 2006 and 2019 and employed a comparative design to test the effect of exergames on fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults. Two reviewers screened the literature and extracted data on the exergame platform, participants, study design, and results. A modified PEDro scale was used to assess study quality. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Results: Our literature search resulted in 23 eligible studies on exergame interventions where fear of falling was the primary or secondary outcome. Most interventions (35%) occurred within hospitals and were delivered via a Wii-based system (61%). Fear of falling was most commonly measured using the Falls Efficacy Scale, the Activities-specific Balance Scale and their modified versions. A total of 15 of the 23 studies reported statistically significant changes in fear of falling. Quality assessment showed 10 studies to be rated as 'good.' Conclusion: This review showed that exergame may have a positive effect in reducing fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults. The finding provides a direction for clinical practice in the research area of intervention on fear of falling in older adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Canada, only 11% of stroke survivors have access to outpatient and community-based rehabilitation after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Hence, innovative community-based strategies are needed to provide adequate postrehabilitation services. The VirTele program, which combines virtual reality exergames and a telerehabilitation app, was developed to provide stroke survivors with residual upper extremity deficits, the opportunity to participate in a personalized home rehabilitation program. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the feasibility of VirTele for remote upper extremity rehabilitation in a chronic stroke survivor; explore the preliminary efficacy of VirTele on upper extremity motor function, the amount and quality of upper extremity use, and impact on quality of life and motivation; and explore the determinants of behavioral intention and use behavior of VirTele along with indicators of empowerment. METHODS: A 63-year-old male stroke survivor (3 years) with moderate upper extremity impairment participated in a 2-month VirTele intervention. He was instructed to use exergames (5 games for upper extremity) for 30 minutes, 5 times per week, and conduct videoconference sessions with a clinician at least once per week. Motivational interviewing was incorporated into VirTele to empower the participant to continue exercising and use his upper extremities in everyday activities. Upper extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment-upper extremity), amount and quality of upper extremity use (Motor Activity Log-30), and impact on quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale-16) and motivation (Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire-15) were measured before (T1), after (T2) VirTele intervention, and during a 1- (T3) and 2-month (T4) follow-up period. Qualitative data were collected through logs and semistructured interviews. Feasibility data (eg, number and duration of videoconference sessions and adherence) were documented at the end of each week. RESULTS: The participant completed 48 exergame sessions (33 hours) and 8 videoconference sessions. Results suggest that the VirTele intervention and the study protocol could be feasible for stroke survivors. The participant exhibited clinically meaningful improvements at T2 on the Fugl-Meyer and Stroke Impact Scale-16 and maintained these gains at T3 and T4. During the follow-up periods, the amount and quality of upper extremity use showed meaningful changes, suggesting more involvement of the affected upper extremity in daily activities. The participant demonstrated a high level of autonomous motivation, which may explain his adherence. Performance, effort, and social influence have meaningful weights in the behavioral intention of using VirTele. However, the lack of control of technical and organizational infrastructures may influence the long-term use of technology. At the end of the intervention, the participant demonstrated considerable empowerment at both the behavioral and capacity levels. CONCLUSIONS: VirTele was shown to be feasible for use in chronic stroke survivors for remote upper extremity rehabilitation. Meaningful determinants of behavioral intention and use behavior of VirTele were identified, and preliminary efficacy results are promising.

This review was aimed to assess the possible role of exergames in reducing weight-related outcomes among overweight/obese children and/or adolescents. The databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus were interrogated to detect controlled studies involving healthy overweight/obese children and adolescents in interventions based exclusively on exergames. Out of a total of 648 articles found, 10 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The included studies differ for duration, setting and type of intervention, frequency of active game sessions, and outcomes considered. Seven out of ten studies reported better outcomes in children/adolescents involved in the interventions, with significant differences between groups in four, while three studies found better outcomes in control groups. These results suggest a possible positive effect of active video games on weight-related outcomes in obese children and adolescents. However, further research is still needed to define if they can be effectively used in childhood obesity treatment and which may be the most effective approach.

METHODS: X-Torp is a serious exergame combining motor and cognitive activities. Ninety-one subjects (mean age = 81.7 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination = 18.3) were recruited in 16 centers. Centers were randomized into intervention and control centers. Subjects underwent assessment for cognitive and behavioral symptoms at baseline (BL), the end of the intervention (W12), and 12 weeks after the end of the intervention (W24). RESULTS: The comparison of neuropsychiatric symptoms between BL and W12 and W24 showed that subjects of the intervention group improved in apathy between BL and W12. Mixed analysis (time BL, W12, W24 x group) indicated a significant increase in apathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the control subjects. DISCUSSION: The use of X-Torp improved neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly apathy. Future studies should more consistently use behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms as outcome measures."

Increased physical fitness may have a positive influence on physical and mental health outcomes in children with DCD. Yet, little has been done to develop interventions to improve fitness performance in this group. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of graded exergames in 7 to 12-year-old children with DCD and typically developing (TD) peers. Participants (32 DCD and 28 TD children) received a 30-min training session twice weekly for 10 weeks. Performance on motor coordination (MABC-2 test), balance, aerobic, and anaerobic fitness tests were assessed at the beginning and end of training. In addition, enjoyment and perception of exertion were measured for each participant during the training period. Both children with DCD and TD children significantly improved on motor coordination, balance, aerobic, and anaerobic fitness at the end of the training. A significant Group by Time interaction was observed on the MABC-2 total [F (1, 55) = 13.19; p < 0.001] and balance scores [F (1, 55) = 26.83; p < 0.0001], with the DCD group demonstrating larger improvements than the TD children. Both groups enjoyed the program throughout the training period even though they rated the training to be of high intensity. These findings indicate that graded exergames may serve as potential treatment for impaired fitness in children with DCD. Regular participation in graded exergames in school settings may be needed to enhance and maintain fitness performance in young children with and without DCD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. Patients with MS experience a wide range of physical and cognitive dysfunctions that affect their quality of life. A promising training approach that concurrently trains physical and cognitive functions is video game-based physical exercising (ie, exergaming). Previous studies have indicated that exergames have positive effects on balance and cognitive functions in patients with MS. However, there is still a need for specific, user-centered exergames that function as a motivating and effective therapy tool for patients with MS and studies investigating their usability and feasibility. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this interdisciplinary research project is to develop usable and feasible user-centered exergames for the pressure-sensitive plate Dividat Senso by incorporating theoretical backgrounds from movement sciences, neuropsychology, and game research as well as participatory design processes. METHODS: Focus groups (patients and therapists) were set up to define the user-centered design process. This was followed by the field testing of newly developed exergame concepts. Two sequential usability and feasibility studies were conducted on patients with MS. The first study included a single exergaming session followed by measurements. Between the first and second studies, prototypes were iterated based on the findings. The second study ran for 4 weeks (1-2 trainings per week), and measurements were taken before and after the intervention. For each study, participants answered the System Usability Scale (SUS; 10 items; 5-point Likert Scale; score range 0-100) and interview questions. In the second study, participants answered game experience-related questionnaires (Flow Short Scale [FSS]: 13 items; 7-point Likert Scale; score range 1-7; Game Flow questionnaire: 17 items; 6-point Likert Scale; score range 1-6). Mixed methods were used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: In the first study (N=16), usability was acceptable, with a median SUS score of 71.3 (IQR 58.8-80.0). In the second study (N=25), the median SUS scores were 89.7 (IQR 78.8-95.0; before) and 82.5 (IQR 77.5-90.0; after), and thus, a significant decrease was observed after training (z=-2.077; P=.04; r=0.42). Moreover, high values were observed for the overall FSS (pre: median 5.9, IQR 4.6-6.4; post: median 5.8, IQR 5.4-6.2) and overall Game Flow Questionnaire (pre: median 5.0, IQR 4.7-5.3; post: median 5.1, IQR 4.9-5.3). A significant decrease was observed in the item perceived importance (FSS: z=-2.118; P=.03; r=0.42). Interviews revealed that user-centered exergames were usable, well accepted, and enjoyable. Points of reference were identified for future research and development. CONCLUSIONS: The project revealed that the newly developed, user-centered exergames were usable and feasible for patients with MS. Furthermore, exergame elements should be considered in the development phase of user-centered exergames (for patients with MS). Future studies are needed to provide indications about the efficacy of user-centered exergames for patients with MS."

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are a concrete answer to many needs in the healthcare framework since they enable remote support for patients and foster continuity of care. Currently, frail elderly people are among end users who most need and would benefit from IoT solutions from both a social and a healthcare point of view. Indeed, IoT technologies can provide a set of services to monitor the healthcare of the elderly or support them in order to reduce the risk of injuries, and preserve their motor and cognitive abilities. The main feature of IoT solutions for the elderly population is ease of use. Indeed, to fully exploit the potential of an IoT solution, patients should be able to autonomously deal with it. The remote-monitoring validation engineering system (ReMoVES) described here is an IoT solution that caters to the specific needs of frail elderly individuals. Its architecture was designed for use at rehabilitation centers and at patients' homes. The system is user-friendly and comfortably usable by persons who are not familiar with technology. In addition, exergames enhance patient engagement in order to curb therapy abandonment. Along with the technical presentation of the solution, a real-life scenario application is described referring to sit-to-stand activity.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The customisable Personalized In-home eXErgames for Rehabilitation (PIXER) system captures the user's image, generates a live model, and incorporates it into a virtual exergame. PIXER provides a recording system for home exercise programs (HEPs) by adapting virtual objects, customizes the exergame and creates a digital diary. Ten persons with stroke, performed HEPs with PIXER for 1 month, and without PIXER for 2 additional months. In-game performance data, measures of physical functioning (PF) including Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Timed Up & Go (TUG) and Goal Attainment (GA) Scale obtained at baseline, 1- and 3 months were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy percent of participants completed the 1-month timepoint, 50% completed all timepoints. In-game data: Number of repetitions completed; Anomalies reported; and Percentage of bubbles hit showed positive trends. Compared to baseline, all SIS physical functioning (PF) scores were higher at 1 month, TUG scores showed no overall improvement and GA scale scores were 77% at 3 months. CONCLUSION: It is feasible for community-dwelling patients to perform HEP after stroke using PIXER, a novel, exergames system, and potentially improve their function.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONHome Exercises performed using a novel, 3-dimensional, customizable Personalized In-home eXErgames for Rehabilitation (PIXER) system is feasible for community-dwelling patients after stroke.In-game performance data obtained in this clinical pilot study showed positive trends of improvement in several study participants.PIXER has potential to improve functional outcomes for community-dwelling adults with stroke.",

VR exergames are active video games controlled by bodily movements in a safe surrounding with advantages of physical activity engagement and interactions. The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of VR exergames in improving older adults' cognition and ameliorating depressive outcome by a systematic review, meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression. DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults over 60 years old. METHODS: Four electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane, were searched for related articles. After evaluation, 18 randomized control trials were selected for qualitative and quantitative synthesis. RESULTS: The meta-analytical results found moderate effects of VR exergames on overall cognitive function and memory, and a large effect on depressive outcomes in older adults. Commercial VR games had more-significant and larger effects on depressive outcomes than exergames with VR devices. The meta-regression results revealed that the total intervention duration had a significant effect on depressive outcomes. A higher intervention duration had greater effects on depressive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This meta-analytical study suggests that VR exergames can provide potential positive influences on cognition, memory, and depression in older adult populations. VR exergames could be an interesting strategy for active aging and a good mental health status.",

PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science, SciELO, Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde, and Google Scholar were searched, and manual searches of the reference lists of included studies and hand-searches on Physiotherapy Evidence Database and ResearchGate were conducted from inception to August 10, 2020. Randomized and non-randomized exergame intervention studies with or without a non-exercise group and/or a \"usual care intervention group\" (any other intervention that did not incorporate exergames), which evaluated muscle strength through direct measurements, were included. Forty-seven and 25 studies were included in the qualitative review and meta-analysis, respectively. The between-groups meta-analyses showed no significant differences between exergames and non-exercise control groups for handgrip strength in heathy/unhealthy middle-aged/older adults or knee extension maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in healthy older adults. However, exergames provided a greater increase in handgrip strength, knee flexion MVIC, and elbow extension MVIC, but not knee extension MVIC or elbow flexion MVIC, in individuals with different health statuses when compared to usual care interventions. Also, there was a greater increase in handgrip strength in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy favouring usual care plus exergames compared to usual care interventions. These results suggest that exergames may improve upper and lower limb muscle strength in individuals with different heath statuses compared to usual care interventions, but not muscle strength in middle age/older adults after accounting for random error. Also, exergames appear to be a useful tool for improving handgrip strength in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy when added to usual care. However, as the exergame interventions were applied in different populations and there currently are many different approaches to perform exergames, future randomized controlled trials with high methodological quality and large sample sizes are needed to provide more compelling evidence in favour of a specific exergame protocol, or to elucidate exergame protocol design principles that appear to strongly influence outcomes.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of an exergame program (TennisVirtua-4, Playstation Kinect) combined with traditional tennis training on autonomic regulation, tennis technique, gross motor skills, clinical reaction time, and cognitive inhibitory control in children. Sixty-three children were randomized into four groups (1st - two exergame and two regular trainings sessions/week, 2nd - one exergame and one regular training sessions/week, 3rd - two regular trainings sessions/week, and 4th - one regular training session/week) and compared at baseline, 6-month immediately post intervention and at 1-year follow-up post intervention. At 6-month post intervention the combined exergame and regular training sessions revealed: higher breathing frequency, heart rate (all ps ≤ 0.001) and lower skin conductance levels (p = 0.001) during exergaming; additional benefits in the point of contact and kinetic chain elements of the tennis forehand and backhand technique (all ps ≤ 0.001); negative impact on the shot preparation and the follow-through elements (all ps ≤ 0.017); higher ball skills (as part of the gross motor skills) (p < 0.001); higher percentages of clinical reaction time improvement (1st -9.7% vs 3rd group -7.4% and 2nd -6.6% vs 4th group -4.4%, all ps ≤ 0.003) and cognitive inhibitory control improvement in both congruent (1st -20.5% vs 3rd group -18.4% and 2nd -11.5% vs 4th group -9.6%, all ps ≤ 0.05) and incongruent (1st group -19.1% vs 3rd group -12.5% and 2nd group -11.4% vs 4th group -6.5%, all ps ≤ 0.001) trials. The 1-year follow-up test showed no differences in the tennis technique, clinical reaction time and cognitive inhibitory control improvement between groups with the same number of trainings per week. The findings support exergaming as an additional training tool, aimed to improve important cognitive-motor tennis skills by adding dynamics to the standardized training process. Caution should be placed to planning this training, e.g., in a mesocycle, since exergaming might decrease the improvement of specific tennis technique parts of the trainees.

Aerobic exercise and cognitive training represent two promising interventions for AD prevention, but their synergistic effect has yet to be assessed in persons with SCD. METHODS/DESIGN: The purpose of this single-blinded, 3-parallel group randomized controlled trial is to test the synergistic efficacy of an exergame intervention (simultaneous moderate-intensity aerobic cycling and cognitive training) on cognition and aerobic fitness in community-dwelling older adults with SCD. The Exergames Study will randomize 96 participants on a 2:1:1 allocation ratio to 3-month exergame, cycling only, or attention control (stretching). Primary outcomes include global cognition and aerobic fitness, which will be assessed at baseline and after 3 months. The specific aims of the Exergames Study are to (1) determine the efficacy of the exergame in older adults with SCD and (2) assess the distraction effect of exergame on aerobic fitness. Data will be analyzed using ANOVA following intention-to-treat. DISCUSSION: This study will test the synergistic effects of exergame on cognition and aerobic fitness. It has the potential to advance prevention research for AD by providing effect-size estimates for future trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04311736 . Registered on 17 March 2020.",

This study describes a single-blind randomised clinical trial that will aim to investigate the effects of exergames training on postural balance in patients with chronic stroke. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Forty-two individuals with chronic stroke (>6 months), aged 20-75 years, will be randomised into two groups: the experimental group, which will be subjected to an exergames protocol, and control group, which will undergo a kinesiotherapy protocol. Both protocols are based on postural balance. The intervention will consist of 40-minute sessions two times per week for 10 consecutive weeks. The volunteers will be evaluated before the treatment, at the end of the interventions and 8 weeks thereafter. The primary outcome will be postural balance (Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test, Timed Up and Go test and Centre of Pressure variables) and secondary outcomes will include gait (6 m timed walk and Kinovea Software), cortical activation patterns (electroencephalography Emotiv EPOC), functional independence (Functional Independence Measure), quality of life (Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale) and motivation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (number 3.434.350). The results of the study will be disseminated to participants through social networks and will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and scientific meetings.

      "abstract": "Stroke is currently the world's second cause of disability. It can cause deficits such as postural control, and telerehabilitation could improve the therapeutic dose as well as functional results. The aim of this work is to determine the effectiveness and usability of a low-cost telerehabilitation system in patients with stroke. We developed a telerehabilitation system based on exergames on smartphones, inertial sensors, and a cloud database. We trained the balance of six participants (three men and three women) in early subacute stroke (seven weeks of progress). In addition to their conventional treatment, these participants trained for a total of nine sessions of 30 min per week, for four weeks. The telerehabilitation group was compared with a control group of four clinically similar participants (three men and one woman). Clinical and usability measurements were made before and after the training. The results show a significant improvement of 11.3 ± 3.5 points in the Berg Balance Scale, 8.3 ± 3.01 points in the Mini-BESTest, and 17.5 ± 9.87 points in the Barthel scale for the telerehabilitation group. However, only the improvements of Berg and Barthel scales were statistically higher for the telerehabilitation group compared to the control group. The proposed system achieved excellent usability on the System Usability Scale (87.5 ± 11.61). Our results demonstrate that a complementary low-cost telemedicine approach is feasible, and that it can significantly improve the balance of stroke patients; therefore, the proposed clinical strategy could potentially improve dosage and overall treatment effectiveness."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Older adults with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to have high body mass index (BMI) and chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. A sedentary lifestyle, which may be attributed to pharmacologic side effects and the symptoms of mental illness, has been difficult to treat. Patients experiencing negative symptoms (e.g. apathy, anhedonia) may be more likely to exercise in a group setting with activities that are designed to stimulate the mind and encourage engagement. \"Exergames,\" or exercise-based videogames, are an interactive and stimulating method to provide aerobic activities. Exercise has also been shown to reduce the symptoms of depression. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a 10-week exergame program on depressive and negative symptoms in older adults with SMI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-group pretest posttest study was conducted with 52 older adults diagnosed with SMI. Participants engaged in group exergame activities for 50-minute sessions three times a week for 10 weeks. The Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) were conducted at enrollment, 5 weeks, and 10 weeks. RESULTS: Participants achieved statistically significant reductions in self-reported depressive symptoms (-0.83, LL -1.46, UL -0.12) and observed negative symptoms (-5.29, LL -7.67, UL -3.14) over a 10-week period. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest utilization of exergames as an adjunct treatment can be an effective, engaging, and cost-efficient method to reducing depressive and negative symptoms in older adults with SMI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Performing physiotherapy exercises in front of a physiotherapist yields qualitative assessment notes and immediate feedback. However, practicing the exercises at home lacks feedback on how well patients are performing the prescribed tasks. The absence of proper feedback might result in patients performing the exercises incorrectly, which could worsen their condition. We present an approach to generate performance scores to enable tracking the progress by both the patient at home and the physiotherapist in the clinic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to propose the use of 2 machine learning algorithms, dynamic time warping (DTW) and hidden Markov model (HMM), to quantitatively assess the patient's performance with respect to a reference. METHODS: Movement data were recorded using a motion sensor (Kinect V2), capable of detecting 25 joints in the human skeleton model, and were compared with those of a reference. A total of 16 participants were recruited to perform 4 different exercises: shoulder abduction, hip abduction, lunge, and sit-to-stand exercises. Their performance was compared with that of a physiotherapist as a reference. RESULTS: Both algorithms showed a similar trend in assessing participant performance. However, their sensitivity levels were different. Although DTW was more sensitive to small changes, HMM captured a general view of the performance, being less sensitive to the details. CONCLUSIONS: The chosen algorithms demonstrated their capacity to objectively assess the performance of physical therapy. HMM may be more suitable in the early stages of a physiotherapy program to capture and report general performance, whereas DTW could be used later to focus on the details. The scores enable the patient to monitor their daily performance. They can also be reported back to the physiotherapist to track and assess patient progress, provide feedback, and adjust the exercise program if needed."

We searched for systematic reviews or meta-analyses assessing the effects of cognitive-motor dual-task and exergame interventions on cognitive, physical and dual-task functions in cognitively healthy older adults through eight databases (CDSR (Cochrane), MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest and SportDiscus). Two reviewers performed the selection, data extraction and risk of bias evaluation independently (PROSPERO ID: CRD42019143185). Eighteen reviews were included in this overview. Overall, positive effects of cognitive-motor dual-task interventions on cognitive, physical and dual-task functions, as well as exergames on cognitive functions only, were observed in cognitively healthy older adults. In contrast, the effects of exergames on physical functions are more controversial, and their effects on dual-task functions have not been studied. The feasibility, safety, adherence, transfer and retention of benefits for both intervention types are still unclear. Future studies should follow more rigorous methodological standards in order to improve the quality of evidence and provide guidelines for the use of cognitive-motor dual-task and exergame interventions in older adults.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To systematically evaluate the efficacy of exergames in individuals with major neurocognitive disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and PEDro were systematically searched from inception until October 2019 for randomised and clinical controlled trials. Methodological quality of the trials was assessed with the PEDro rating scale or Risk of Bias in Nonrandomised Studies of Interventions-I (ROBINS-I), when appropriate. Grading of Recommendations Assessments, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the overall quality of the evidence. RESULTS: Eight trials, all of moderate to high methodological quality (i.e., PEDro score of 6 or higher or a Robins-I moderate quality score) were included. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to high according to the GRADE criteria. Improvements in gait, mobility and balance and beneficial effects on activities of daily living performance, cognitive function, fear of falls, quality of life and mood following exergaming were reported. Heterogeneity in outcome measures, intervention characteristics and included participants precluded a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature is of moderate to high quality and demonstrates that exergames have a wide range of physical and mental benefits in people with major neurocognitive disorder. More controlled trials are however needed to confirm the existing evidence before exergames can be recommended in treatment guidelines for people with major neurocognitive disorder.Implications for rehabilitationExergames have many physical and mental benefits in people with major neurocognitive disorderExergaming can enhance gait, mobility and balance in people with major neurocognitive disorderEvidence for beneficial cognitive effects of exergaming is emerging.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exergaming is a fun, engaging, and interactive form of exercising that may help overcome some of the traditional exercise barriers and help improve adherence on the part of older adults, providing therapeutic applications for balance recovery and functional mobility. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the effects of exergames on mobility and balance in older adults. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. The following databases were searched from inception to August 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, CINAHL, and INSPEC. We selected randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of exergames on balance or mobility of older adults without neurological conditions, in comparison to no intervention or health education. Two review authors independently screened the trials' titles and abstracts and identified trials for inclusion according to the eligibility criteria. An almost perfect agreement between the authors was observed with respect to interrater reliability of trial selection (kappa = 0.84; P < 0.001). We performed descriptive analysis of the quantitative data to summarize the evidence. Meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan. A random effects model was used to compute the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: After screening 822 records, 12 trials comparing exergames with no intervention were included. A total of 1520 older adults participated in the studies, with a mean age of 76 ± 6 years for the experimental group and 76 ± 5 years for the control group. Quantitative synthesis showed significant improvements in balance and mobility based on the center of pressure sway (SMD = - 0.89; 95%CI = - 1.26 to - 0.51; P = 0.0001; I2 = 58%), Berg Balance Scale (MD = 2.15; 95%CI = 1.77 to 2.56; P = 0.0001; I2 = 96%), and on Timed Up and Go test (MD = - 2.48; 95%CI = - 3.83 to - 1.12; P = 0.0003; I2 = 0). CONCLUSIONS: Exergames improved balance and mobility in older adults without neurological disorders and motivate patients to keep performing balance exercises. High quality studies with standardized assessment protocols are necessary to improve the strength of the evidence.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed wide applications of exergames to balance training among the older adults. However, research concerning balance training with the use of Kinect for Xbox has remained scarce. While previous studies have shown the positive effects of exergames on improving balance and preventing falling among the older adults, there has been a paucity of empirical evidence supporting the superiority of Kinect exercise to conventional exercise over balance training among the older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of Kinect exercise against conventional exercise over balance training among the community older adults. METHOD: A total of 20 participants were randomly assigned to the Kinect Exercise Group (N = 10) or the Conventional Exercise Group (N = 10) for a 5-week balance training (45 minutes a time, 2 times a week). Assessor blinding was employed to assess the participants' performance before and after the treatment, including 30-Second Chair Stand Test (30-sec CST), Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Reach Test (FRT), and One-Leg Stance Test (OLST) respectively with eyes open and closed. Subjective feeling of the intensity of pain and side effects were recorded throughout the investigation period. Nonparametric statistics was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Within-group comparison between the pre-test and post-test indicated that significant differences existed in all of the 5 tests (30-sec CST, TUG, FRT, OLST with eyes open, and OLST with eyes closed) in the Kinect exercise group. To the Conventional exercise group, however, significant differences were only observed in 30-sec CST, FRT and OLST with eyes open. With regard to between-group comparison, significant differences were only found in FRT. CONCLUSION: Such results indicated that both treatments were helpful in improving the participants' balance performance, that Kinect exercise was more effective in terms of overall balance ability, and that Kinect exercise was particularly beneficial to functional reach enhancement in comparison with traditional exercise. Kinect exercise could be a feasible, safe, and effective alternative for dynamic balance training among older adults.",

The search generated 957 articles for consideration, which were narrowed to 17 articles after applying exclusion criteria. In studies that required depressive symptoms as an inclusion criterion, there was an improvement in depressive symptoms in older adults following the exergame intervention. In studies that did not require depressive symptoms as an inclusion criterion, researchers found mixed results. Future older adult exergame research should measure depression as a primary outcome, utilize control groups with random sampling, consist of larger sample sizes, and include people with disabilities.",

A total of eight research papers were obtained, in which intervention programs based on the use of exergames were applied to improve different parameters, such as adherence to Physical Activity practice or improvement on a psychological level. As the main findings, it was possible to observe the need to include these types of devices in the classroom since they can work transversally across much content, and the resources are so accessible that they allow improvements at academic level. Likewise, they favor motivation to physical exercise since with adequate volume and intensity parameters, they are related to healthier lifestyles, and the areas of motor skills and logical thinking benefited the most.",

      "abstract": "Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder associated with various etiologies and characterized by deficits in social interaction, emotional reciprocity, communication, motor skills and cognitive functions. Studies have proposed that limited levels of physical activity and late motor skills and fitness, particularly in children and adolescents with ASD, may accentuate social and emotional deficits. In view of this, exergames, which are active video-games, can be considered a low-cost and safe type of exercise for children and adolescents with ASD, since they are more enjoyable than ordinary physical activities, influencing on treatment adherence. Thus, our study aims to evidence the effects of exergames on physical fitness, cognitive functions, and repetitive behaviors in children and adolescents with ASD. Despite the small number of studies investigating the effects of exergames as new strategy in children and adolescents with ASD, results suggest exergames as potential tool for the treatment of children and adolescents with ASD for improvement in physical fitness, cognitive functions and repetitive behavior. Our review pointed towards the importance of exergames for children and adolescents with ASD. Despite few studies conducted about this issue, we can consider exergames a potential tool to increase physical fitness, cognitive functions and to decrease repetitive behavior in children and adolescents with ASD. Moreover, health professionals should be careful when attempting to help this population, because the current literature is unclear yet about the improvement of ASD features through exergames."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate systematically the efficacy of exergames for balance dysfunction in neurological conditions and to identify factors of exergaming protocols that may influence their effects. METHODS: We searched electronic databases for randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of commercial exergames versus alternative interventions on balance dysfunction as assessed by standard clinical scales in adults with acquired neurological disabilities. Standardized mean differences (Hedge's g) were calculated with random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were run to explore potential modifiers of effect size. RESULTS: Out of 106 screened articles, 41 fulfilled criteria for meta-analysis, with a total of 1223 patients included. Diseases under investigation were stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and myelopathy. The pooled effect size of exergames on balance was moderate (g = 0.43, p < 0.001), with higher frequency (number of sessions per week) associated with larger effect (β = 0.24, p = 0.01). There was no effect mediated by the overall duration of the intervention and intensity of a single session. The beneficial effect of exergames could be maintained for at least 4 weeks after discontinuation, but their retention effect was specifically explored in only 11 studies, thus requiring future investigation. Mild to moderate adverse events were reported in a minority of studies. We estimated a low risk of bias, mainly attributable to the lack of double-blindness and not reporting intention-to-treat analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled evidence suggests that exergames improve balance dysfunction and are safe in several neurological conditions. The findings of high-frequency interventions associated with larger effect size, together with a possible sustained effect of exergaming, may guide treatment decisions and inform future research.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Evaluation of the effects of exergames in women with fibromyalgia on the impact of the disease-pain threshold and physical variables-compared to performing stretching exercises. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five women were enrolled in the study and divided by simple randomization into two treatment groups: the control group (n = 19) and the Wii™ (exergames) group (n = 16). Participants were evaluated using the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ), algometry, step tests, cardiopulmonary parameters, and fatigue in the lower limbs. The participants underwent treatments for a period of 7 weeks with three 1-hour sessions weekly and were reevaluated after the 10th and the 20th sessions. Results: The exergames group showed significant reduction of their fibromyalgia symptoms, as demonstrated by lower FIQ scores in the key domains on questions regarding missed work, pain, fatigue, problems resting, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. Significant improvements were observed in mean algometric values in the cervical region, the second chondrocostal junction, the lateral epicondyle, left medial knee border, left occipital region, trapezius, supraspinatus, gluteal muscles, and the greater trochanter. Improved cardiovascular adaptation was reflected by decreased systolic blood pressure, reduction in fatigue of the lower limbs assessed by the CR10 Borg scale, and improved exercise capacity assessed by a step test. Conclusion: Exergames have the potential to increase exercise capacity, decrease the impact of fibromyalgia, promote cardiovascular adaptation, reduce fatigue of lower limbs, and improve the pain threshold in women with fibromyalgia.",

      "abstract": "People who survive a stroke usually suffer movement disorders resulting in involuntary abnormal movements. Intensive and repetitive physiotherapy is often a key to functional restoration of movements. Rehabilitation centers have recently offered balance training supported by exergames in addition to conventional therapy. The primary objective was to investigate different types of balance training (multi-exergaming and conventional) in addition to a conventional 6-week physiotherapy program. Furthermore, we examined the choice of an appropriate exergame to target balance training. We designed a randomized pilot trial. Hospital inpatients with stroke aged 33-65 were recruited and randomized into 2 groups by drawing lots; a control group receiving 1 week of conventional balance training and an exergaming group 1 week of multiple-game exergaming, comprising single leg exercises, weight shifting, balancing and standing up. Center of pressure was monitored for the exergaming group and clinical data were collected (non-blinded assessment) using Four Square Step Test, Timed Up and Go, 10 m Walk Test, Romberg, Sharpened Romberg, Clinical Test for Sensory Interaction in Balance in both groups. Statistical tests were used to find significant (p < 0.05) differences and Cohen's U3 for effect sizes. Recruited participants (20/30) met the inclusion criteria and were randomized; 10 per group. 1 participant of the exergaming group was excluded from center of pressure analysis. Both groups demonstrated substantively and statistically significant improvements of functional balance, in particular the exergaming group (FSST p = 0.009, U3 = 0.9 and 10 MWT p = 0.008, U3 = 0.9). However, significant differences between the groups were found in tests with eyes closed, Sharpened Romberg test (p = 0.05) and standing on the right leg (p = 0.035). The center of pressure area decreased up to 20% for the exergaming group. Both types of additional balance training demonstrated comparable outcomes, however, the multi-exergaming could target specific motor control disorders by the selection of exergames according to Gentile's taxonomy. We may not prioritize exergaming due to the low statistical power of clinical outcomes. However, exergaming enables independent balance training, which is feasible without strenuous physiotherapy and may thus be crucial for future home or telerehabilitation services.

All the participants completed assessments of body composition, muscle strength, flexibility, balance and cardiopulmonary endurance at baseline and after 10-week intervention. After 10 weeks of training, the intervention group showed significant improvements in cardiopulmonary endurance and leg muscle strength. Moreover, there were significant differences between the intervention and control group in changes in aerobic fitness and leg muscle strength. The exergame program effectively improved cardiopulmonary endurance and leg muscle strength in healthy middle-aged and older adults. It could be an alternative to conventional exercise.",
