      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Alternative therapy has been widely used in CRC treatment, with deuterium-depleted water (DDW) demonstrating promising anticancer effects in a number of cancer types. The aim of the present study was to assess the anticancer effects of DDW in CRC cells and the possible mechanism involved. HT-29 and DLD-1 cells were cultured in conditioned medium prepared with DDW. Cell malignant behaviors were assessed using EdU, colony formation, tumor-sphere formation, wound-healing and Transwell assays. Stemness-related proteins, Nanog and octamer-binding transcription factor-4, were assessed using western blotting. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescent probes. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to assess the expression of forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). The results indicated that treatment with DDW significantly inhibited the proliferation, tumor-sphere formation, migration and invasion of HT-29 and DLD-1 cells, as well as the expression of stemness-related proteins. In the mechanistic analysis, DDW treatment was revealed to decrease ROS production and downregulate the expression of FoxM1. As the downstream targets of FoxM1, the expression levels of CCND1 and MMP9 were also shown to be decreased. Moreover, H2O2-induced oxidative stress rescued FoxM1 expression in the presence of DDW treatment, and overexpression of FoxM1 was demonstrated to abolish the DDW-mediated tumor suppressive effects. The findings from the present study indicate that the anticancer effects of DDW in CRC cells occur by inactivating the ROS/FoxM1 signaling pathway. Moreover, the results provide a possible agent for CRC treatment."

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) involves lipid accumulation in liver without consumption of alcohol and affects many people worldwide. NAFLD is associated with metabolic syndrome disease such as obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. However, there are no pharmacologic therapies for NAFLD. Recently, there are increasing reports that several natural plants can inhibit lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) leaves have been used in traditional medicine for rheumatism, stomach ache, emetic, skin rashes, and earaches. Our objective was to investigate the effect of bay laurel leaves water extract (BLW) on free fatty acid (FFA) treated hepatocyte and high fructose, high fat (HFHF) diet in a mouse model of NAFLD. In vitro, lipid accumulation increased only in the FFA treated group, while BLW reduced lipid accumulation to a level comparable to that only in the FFA treated group. Cellular antioxidants were increased in the BLW compared to the only FFA-treated group, but cellular MDA levels were decreased in the BLW compared to the only FFA treated group. Cellular lipid accumulation, inflammation, and apoptosis were reduced in the BLW compared to the only FFA treated group. In vivo, serum ALT, AST, and GGT levels in the BLW supplementation group were significantly decreased compared with the HFHF group. Hepatic TC, TG, and MDA levels were significantly decreased in the HFHF+100 and HFHF+200 groups compared to the HFHF group. The hepatic antioxidant activities in the BLW supplementation groups were significantly increased compared to the HFHF group. The expression of proteins related to hepatic inflammation and apoptosis was reduced in the BLW supplementation groups compared to the HFHF group. These results suggest that BLW could be potentially useful in the treatment of NAFLD due to its inhibitory effects on hepatic lipogenesis, hepatic inflammation, and hepatic apoptosis."

Its effect on water polo athletes remains unclear. METHODS: This study involved 46 water polo athletes (age = 16.89 ± 2.89 years, height = 173.09 ± 9.40 cm, mass = 64.50 ± 11.96 kg, BMI = 21.39 ± 2.81 kg/m²) randomized into T10 and control groups. The T10 group performed T10 exercises three times weekly for 10 weeks, with each exercise consisting of 2 × 10 repetitions. The control group followed regular water polo training without additional exercises. Assessments were conducted before and after the intervention, measuring upper extremity internal and external rotation strength with an isokinetic dynamometer, shoulder stability using the Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Test (CKCUEST), and shoulder flexibility through internal and external rotation range of motion tests. RESULTS: The T10 group showed significant improvements in CKCUEST scores, shoulder flexibility, and non-dominant extremity internal rotation strength compared to pre-intervention values (P < 0.05). In CKCUEST average touches and normalized score measurements, the T10 group performed significantly better than the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: T10 exercises enhanced stability and flexibility in water polo athletes, with partial effectiveness in improving strength."

      "abstract": "Drinking water opportunistic pathogens (OPs) and disinfection byproducts (DBPs) both pose risks to public health, and their variable occurrence from source to tap complicates efforts to control them simultaneously. Management of OPs and DBPs is further hindered by the historical division between microbial and chemical research. This review brings together the current knowledge regarding OPs and DBPs, identifies factors that influence the occurrence of both, and highlights areas where research is needed to better understand their health risks. First, we examine the current understanding of how OPs and DBPs are jointly influenced by physicochemical parameters, source water characteristics, treatment processes including disinfection, and distribution system properties. Temperature, for example, can affect OP and DBP occurrence, where higher temperatures can promote the growth of some OPs, such as Legionella pneumophila, but temperature's effect on DBPs is species-dependent. Methods for quantifying the risks associated with OPs (quantitative microbial risk assessment) and DBPs (chemical risk assessment) are compared, finding that the numerous assumptions and data gaps associated with each method limit comparability across contaminant types. We highlight the urgent need to fill existing data gaps and develop a more unified risk framework so as to move toward holistic assessment of microbial and chemical risks. This review provides suggestions for future research, highlighting ways that researchers might utilize established practices in OP or DBP studies to further our understanding of the other. For example, analysis of source water organic matter composition, which has advanced our understanding of DBP formation, could be utilized to elucidate how source water characteristics influence OPs. This review bridges the gap between the OP and DBP disciplines, arguing that collaboration between the two is needed to address the pressing challenges facing water systems today."

      "abstract": "Identifying bacterial transmission pathways is crucial to inform strategies that limit the spread of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here we assessed Escherichia coli strain-sharing and overlap of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across humans, poultry, canines, soil, and drinking water within and between households in urban informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. We collected 321 samples from 50 households with half having access to chlorinated water. We performed Pooling Isolated Colonies-seq, which sequences pools of up to five E. coli colonies per sample to capture strain diversity. Pooling Isolated Colonies-seq captured 1,516 colonies and identified 154 strain-sharing events, overcoming limitations of single-isolate sequencing and metagenomics. Within households, strain-sharing rates and resistome similarities across sample types were strongly correlated, suggesting clonal transmission of ARGs. E. coli isolated from the environment carried clinically relevant ARGs. Strain-sharing was rare between animals and humans but frequent between humans and drinking water. E. coli-contaminated stored drinking water was associated with higher human-human strain-sharing within households. These results suggest that contaminated drinking water facilitates human to human strain-sharing, and water treatment can disrupt transmission."

Carbon-based metal oxide nanocomposites are a promising solution for the treatment of polluted water. This paper aims to review the current state of research on the application of these nanocomposites as photocatalysts for complete water treatment, describing breakthroughs in contaminant removal from 2019 through 2024 and milestones in water disinfection from 2016 through 2024. It includes discussion on the utilization of nanocomposites of MOs with carbon materials to improve photocatalytic efficiency and addresses the advantages and drawbacks of these materials, including electron-hole recombination and agglomeration. The review focuses on the photocatalytic mechanisms of these nanocomposites and highlights the importance of heterostructures formed between metal oxides and carbon materials (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon quantum dots), which enhance light absorption and hydroxyl radical generation, thereby increasing the efficiency of pollutant degradation and water disinfection. The review describes the properties of different MOs (n-type and p-type), exploring synergies between MOs and carbon materials and discussing the benefits and challenges of their application in wastewater treatment and pathogen inactivation. The review ends with a scientometric analysis of research trends in this field."

      "abstract": "Latest findings demonstrate that the oxidative Fe(II)/sulfite (Fe(II)/S(IV)) process can rapidly generate iron particles, holding potential for coagulation while simultaneously removing emerging contaminants. Herein, we first report the synergistic oxidation-coagulation treatment of RW by Fe(II)/S(IV) process, and compare with traditional Fe-based coagulation (FeSO4, Fe2(SO4)3), Fe(II)/PDS and Fe(II)/PMS processes. Results revealed that the Fe(II)/S(IV) process outperformed traditional Fe-based coagulants, Fe(II)/PDS and Fe(II)/PMS in removing turbidity, UV254, and DOC. For emerging contaminants removal from RW, Fe(II)/PMS showed the highest efficiency, followed by Fe(II)/PDS, while Fe(II)/S(IV) was slightly less effective, it still demonstrated a significant improvement (40 %∼65 %) over traditional coagulation processes. Moreover, the Fe(II)/S(IV) process is the most effective in reducing DBPs formation (56 %∼86 %). Although Fe(II)/PDS and Fe(II)/PMS also significantly reduce DBPs formation, their high oxidation potential at low pH generated toxic N-DBPs. Mechanistic analysis indicated that the Fe(II)/S(IV) process was most effective in removing humic substances and biopolymers. Its moderate oxidation preserved macromolecular structures, enhancing coagulation. And the hydrolysis of S(IV) generates OH⁻, promoting electrostatic neutralization and floc enlargement. Cost analysis revealed that the Fe(II)/S(IV) process is significantly more economical, with costs only 1/60 of Fe(II)/PMS. These results highlight the Fe(II)/S(IV) process as a promising and cost-effective approach to advanced water treatment."

      "abstract": "Antibiotics can modify populations of multidrug-resistant microorganism (MDRO) in urban wastewater. Our objectives were to quantify the differences in MDR Gram-negative bacteria between influents and effluents of WWTPs of a Spanish city and to evaluate the influence of human antibiotic prescriptions, as well as the persistence of these bacteria after treatment and their genetic relatedness to clinical isolates. The mean count of ESBL producers and carbapenemase producers were 3.77 and 2.74 log 10 CFU/ml, respectively. The reduction achieved by water treatment of ESBL-producing organisms was 1.4-log (96.11 %), whereas a 1.8-log reduction (98.36 %) was obtained regarding carbapenemase producing organisms. Aeromonas spp. predominated among MDROs and blaKPC-2 was the main carbapenemase detected in the influent wastewater samples. Among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae influent isolates, 44 % and 30 %, respectively, belonged to high-risk clones. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae, 10.6 % matched clinical isolates and one strain from an ongoing hospital outbreak was identified among raw samples. New MDROs and persistence of certain strains were detected in effluent samples. Quinolone and third-generation cephalosporin prescriptions, flow rate and population density were associated with higher OXA-48 producer counts. Despite reductions, additional technologies should be implemented in WWTPs receiving hospital discharges. Given the prevalence of environmental species, culture-based and metagenomic approaches should be combined to distinguish between human and sewage sources for antibiotic resistance monitoring. Overall, this study shows that WWTPs with secondary treatment are effective at removing MDRO, and antibiotic stewardship is a potential strategy to reduce the release of MDROs."

      "abstract": "Water temperature fluctuations directly impact pollutant decomposition processes in wastewater. Thermoelectric effect is considered an alternative to utilize these temperature variations for pollution control. In this study, a system for persulfate (PS) activation by Ag2Se thermoelectric catalyst under water temperature gradients (Ag₂Se/ΔT/PS) was developed for humic acid (HA) degradation in water. The experimental results showed that the Ag2Se/ΔT/PS system achieved a 90.7 % HA removal efficiency, outperforming both PS/ΔT (PS with temperature gradients) and Ag2Se/ΔT systems. Thermoelectric simulations indicated that Ag2Se generated an electric field under temperature variations, with higher current density at surface pores where polarized charges efficiently activated PS. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the thermoelectric effect of Ag2Se lowered the energy barriers for PS activation and ·SO4- generation. Different from ·OH-led decomposition of HA in the Ag₂Se/ΔT system, ·SO4- and ·OH dominated HA decomposition in the Ag₂Se/ΔT/PS system, and ¹O₂ also contributed this process. Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) revealed that oxidation, decarboxylation, and sulfidation were the primary pathways driving HA degradation, leading to decreases in CHO-containing compounds and formation of S-rich byproducts. These findings highlighted the potential of thermoelectric catalysts in advancing water treatment technologies."

Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is promising for destructive treatment of PFAS in water, and Magnéli phase titanium suboxide (TSO) is regarded as one of only few suitable anode materials for this application. We herein conducted an in-silico survey with Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations to identify possible beneficial dopant elements, and then prepared TSO anodes doped with Niobium (Nb-TSO) or Cerium (Ce-TSO) by sintering. The doped TSO thus prepared exhibited great robustness, having service lifetimes longer than the pristine Ti4O7 anode, making them useful for EO applications in PFAS treatment. PFOS degradation by EO using Nb-TSO anode was faster than that on the pristine Ti4O7 anode, with energy consumption approximately 1.8 times lower. Further characterizations and DFT simulations reveal that the enhanced efficiency of Nb-TSO anode is attributed to its reduced charge transfer resistance and increased effective electroactive surface area (EESA). The EESA of the Ce-TSO anode was reduced in comparison to the pristine Ti4O7, but PFOS degradation rates normalized by EESA were increased significantly for EO with Ce-TSO anode, due to its increased oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and hydroxyl radical production. The doped TSO anodes prepared in this study by sintering will be useful in EO treatment of PFAS-contaminated waters, with improved service life and performance, and the study provides understandings to guide further improvements of the TSO anodes via doping."

These properties render MOFs particularly suitable for environmental remediation. However, evaluating all available MOFs is impractical due to their vast number. To address this, we employed computational screening using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations on a database of over 14 000 MOFs to identify the most promising candidates for antiparasitic drug (ivermectin, IVM) adsorption, drug delivery, and membrane filtration. The GCMC simulations identified 584 MOFs with potential applications. Among them, 147 MOFs demonstrated strong IVM adsorption capabilities, making them suitable for drug delivery and adsorption applications. The remaining 437 MOFs exhibited properties ideal for membrane filtration, specifically for reverse osmosis and nanofiltration to separate IVM. The loading capacity and isosteric heat of the 147 MOFs at 101.325 kPa and 298 K were calculated and correlated with various structural properties, including largest void diameter, pore-limiting diameter, accessible volume, density, and helium void fraction. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the most promising MOFs to understand the IVM loading mechanism."

In this work, we introduce a novel bacterial cellulose (BC)-based aerogel, enhanced with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), designed for effective dye sorption and oil-water separation. The CMC/BC and PDMS/CMC/BC aerogels, fabricated through a straightforward mixing and freeze-drying process, exhibiting a high porosity of 96 %, a low density of 0.097 g/cm3, and remarkable mechanical strength with a compressive stress of 0.70 MPa at 80 % strain. The CMC/BC aerogel exhibited an exceptional dye sorption capacity of 484 mg/g, achieving a maximum removal rate of 96.80 % within 12 h. This performance aligns closely with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isothermal model, suggesting that the sorption process is controlled by chemisorption and occurs as a monolayer. Additionally, the PDMS/CMC/BC-11 aerogel exhibited remarkable oil sorption efficiency, attaining 186.03 g/g for petroleum ether, and effectively separated oil from water within 5 s. These findings highlight the potential of the composite aerogels for applications in environmental remediation and industrial processes."

The growth and metabolism of these organisms, as well as their community composition, can affect various aspects of oil field development and oil produced water treatment. In this study, Illumina-based 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community structures of oilfield produced water processed at two treatment stations and subjected to different treatment protocols. Significant differences in microbial community α-diversity and richness resulted from the different treatment protocols. The treatment of oil produced water effectively reduced the oil content, accompanied by the a reduction in Desulfobacterota. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in oil produced water; its core presence, along with Patescibacteria and Desulfobacterota, was identified in a co-occurrence network analysis of the microbial community. Redundancy analysis showed significant positive correlations between microbial community diversity and the oil and suspended solids contents of the oil produced water, highlighting the role of treatment protocols in shaping both microbial composition and water characteristics. Thus, this study provides potential insights into the processes of souring in oil fields and contributes to the theoretical understanding of oil-produced water treatment, which may inform future optimization of treatment protocols."

      "abstract": "Photocatalytic reactions leveraging nanoscale catalyst particles are vital for sustainable environmental remediation but often involve highly complex mechanisms that are difficult to probe due to the pervasive spatiotemporal heterogeneities in the structure and reactivity of the constituent nanosized photocatalyst particles. Super-resolution reaction imaging, with its high spatial and temporal resolution under realistic operando conditions, enables the real-time observation of photocatalytic reaction kinetics and multifaceted charge carrier behaviors at the nanoscale. However, no comprehensive review has yet explored how state-of-the-art super-resolution reaction imaging techniques inform the photocatalyst design for water treatment. This review aims to bridge that gap by providing an overview of the principles and unique advantages of super-resolution catalysis microscopy and related operando imaging tools. We also highlight how these in situ operando techniques can be applied to investigate structure-property relationships in photocatalysts at the single particle and subparticle levels. Key aspects such as size effects, crystal facet effects, bimetallic effects, heterojunction interface effects, defect effects, and particle aggregation effects will be examined through recent case studies, focusing on their impact on photocatalytic water decontamination efficiency. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions of leveraging super-resolution microscopy to distill materials design principles in advancing photocatalytic water treatment."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of irrigation water sources on the quality of olive oil from the Chemlal olive variety in the Hadjadj region, northeast of Mostaganem, Algeria, a coastal area known for its semi-arid climate and intensive olive cultivation. Olive trees (n = 50 per irrigation group) were irrigated with treated wastewater, spring water, and normal water, and the resulting oils were assessed for physicochemical properties, fatty acid composition, and bioactive compound profiles. Treated wastewater demonstrated distinct water quality characteristics, including elevated temperature (15.00 °C), chemical oxygen demand (COD: 58.38 mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5: 29.00 mg/L), ammonium (15.60 mg/L), nitrite (2.55 mg/L), suspended solids (14.00 mg/L), pH (7.40), and conductivity (2.80 µS/cm), reflecting residual organic material and ionic content post-treatment. Heavy metal concentrations in all water sources were within permissible limits for irrigation and drinking purposes, affirming their safety for agricultural use. Olive oil from treated wastewater-irrigated trees exhibited superior quality parameters, including low acidity (1.99%), low peroxide value (6.8 meq O2/kg), enhanced oxidative stability, higher fat content (96.5%), and favorable saponification values. Fatty acid analysis revealed a higher oleic acid content (62.6 mg/kg), known for cardiovascular health benefits. Bioactive compound analysis indicated significantly elevated levels of α-tocopherol (180.25 mg/kg), squalene (7500.8 mg/kg), carotenoids (25.1 mg/kg), and polyphenols (604.76 mg GAE/kg), contributing to increased antioxidant capacity (63.50% DPPH inhibition, a measure of free radical scavenging) and lower lipid peroxidation (0.25 TBARS, an index of oxidative degradation), indicative of superior oxidative stability. Spring water-irrigated oils showed higher acidity, peroxide values, and linoleic acid concentrations, alongside notable antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia. coli, Pseudomonas. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus. aureus. Oils from normal water irrigation were characterized by higher linolenic acid levels, providing a more balanced fatty acid profile. These findings underscore treated wastewater's potential to enhance olive oil's nutritional and functional qualities, particularly its antioxidant activity and stability, while highlighting the role of spring water in enhancing antibacterial properties despite slightly reduced antioxidant stability. These findings are relevant to water-scarce Mediterranean and arid regions, informing sustainable irrigation strategies in line with global climate-resilient agriculture policies.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the combined effects of seasonal variations and water treatment processes on the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), focusing on trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) within a full-scale conventional drinking water treatment plant, were investigated. The seasonal analysis revealed that autumn exhibited the highest levels of disinfection by-product formation potential (DBPFP), with trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) and halo acetic acid formation potential (HAAFP) reaching 255 μg/L and 241 μg/L, respectively, likely due to increased organic matter from leaf fall and runoff. In contrast, winter exhibited the lowest concentrations, with THMFP at 150 μg/L and HAAFP at 56 μg/L. It is attributed to lower temperatures that limit organic matter reactivity. Correlations between 24 water quality parameters and DBPFP types were also examined, identifying critical parameters with the highest correlations. These parameters, including UV254 absorbance and total organic carbon, were used to develop regression models sensitive to seasonal changes and treatment stages. Among the treatment units, the coagulation and aeration stages achieved notable reductions in THM precursors, whereas HAA precursors were less effectively removed, persisting into secondary treatment stages. Chloroform was the predominant THM species, with a peak concentration of 100 μg/L in autumn, decreasing to 76 μg/L in summer, possibly due to increased volatilization in warmer months. For HAAs, dichloroacetic acid displayed the highest seasonal variability, peaking in autumn at 28 μg/L. These findings highlight the need for seasonally adaptive treatment strategies, particularly during high-risk autumn periods when DBPFP levels are elevated. This study provides actionable insights into optimizing treatment protocols to improve DBP control, emphasizing seasonal adjustments' critical role in ensuring compliance with water quality standards."

We studied the specificity of cell lines Wi-38 and HepG2 and the toxic effects of drugs on cell-on-electrode systems. Results: A linear dependence of the peak current on the concentration of cells applied to the electrode in the range from 1 × 105 to 6 × 105 cells/electrode was registered (R2 0.932 for Wi-38 and R2 0.912 for HepG2). The water-soluble form of phosphatidylcholine (wPC) nanoparticles recommended for atherosclerosis treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases did not show a toxic effect on the human fibroblast cells, Wi-38, or the human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, HepG2, at sufficiently high concentrations (such as 0.1-1 mg/mL). The antitumor drug doxorubicin, at concentrations of 3 and 10 μg/mL, showed a pronounced toxic effect on the tested cell lines, where the percentage of living cells was 50-55%. Conclusions: A comparative analysis of the cytotoxicity of wPC (0.1-1 mg/mL) and doxorubicin (3-10 μg/mL) on the cell lines Wi-38 and HepG2 using the MTT test and electrochemical approach for the registration of cells showed their clear adequacy."

      "abstract": "Hair loss, a prevalent condition affecting individuals across various demographics, is associated with hormonal imbalances, oxidative stress, inflammation, and environmental factors. This study evaluated the anti-hair loss potential of the water-soluble fraction of Rhus semialata gall extract (WRGE) and its primary component, Penta-O-Galloyl-β-D-Glucose (PGG), through both in vitro and clinical studies. WRGE was obtained using a standardized extraction process, and PGG was identified via HPLC-DAD and HRESIMS/MS techniques. Human dermal papilla cells (HDPCs) are specialized fibroblasts that can regulate the hair growth cycle and hair follicle growth. HDPCs are widely used in research focused on anti-hair loss. In this study, the anti-hair loss effects of WRGE and PGG on HDPCs were confirmed. WRGE and PGG enhance cell proliferation in HDPCs. These results are associated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the upregulation of hair growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Furthermore, WRGE and PGG significantly inhibited dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-mediated DKK-1 secretion and H2O2-medicated cytotoxicity. Clinical trials further validated these results, demonstrating significant improvements in hair density and visual hair appearance scores in participants treated with WRGE compared to a placebo group. These results collectively suggest that WRGE and PGG may serve as promising natural agents for the prevention and treatment of hair loss by targeting multiple biological pathways, including the regulation of hair growth factors, oxidative stress, and hormonal imbalances."

Wastewater treatment plants and impacted environments are well-known hotspots for antibiotic resistance. However, there is still limited knowledge regarding where antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) acquire mobility. Method: In this study, we aimed to gather evidence on the seasonal patterns of ARG spread in two Mediterranean areas from NE and E of Spain (Ebro River and Ebro Delta, and Xúquer River and Albufera de València), correlating ARG presence, with special focus on the faecal bacteria Escherichia coli, with antibiotic residues and environmental conditions. The analytical methodology employed was based on a suspect screening approach, while a novel prioritisation approach for antibiotics was proposed to identify those areas more susceptible to the spread of ARG. Results: Our findings demonstrate that ARG levels in wastewater were similar across different seasons, although a greater diversity of ARGs was recorded in summer. We hypothesise that horizontal gene transfer among aquatic bacterial populations during the northeastern Mediterranean summer, when temperatures reach approximately 35~40 °C, could be a key driver of ARG dissemination. By contrast, the highest concentrations of antibiotics in winter samples, with temperatures around 5~10 °C, may promote the spread of microbial resistance. Conclusions: Our key findings highlight that water temperature and sunlight irradiation are crucial factors influencing antibiotic levels and microbial abundance, requiring further investigation in future studies."

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive review of studies from the PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases was performed. Only randomized clinical trials that reported the outcomes of thermal ablation treatments, including transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), and Rezum, were included. A network meta-analysis was performed to compare these treatments. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Sixteen studies comprising 1622 patients were included. Rezum did not show efficacy superior to that of traditional conduction ablation methods in terms of the International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life, peak urinary flow rate, and postvoid residual volume. The incidence of acute urinary retention associated with Rezum was similar to that associated with other conduction ablation methods of TUMT and TUNA and transurethral resection of the prostate. Regarding ejaculatory dysfunction, Rezum resulted in outcomes comparable to those of sham treatment. According to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve, Rezum resulted in the lowest incidence of ejaculatory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Rezum provides functional outcomes of urinary symptoms that are comparable to those of conduction ablation therapies. Notably, among the minimally invasive thermal ablation therapies evaluated during this study, Rezum resulted in the lowest incidence of ejaculatory dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "The gastroenterology societies are committed to reducing the carbon footprint of endoscopies and hence, re-examining waste-generating practices. One such practice is the recommendation to use sterile water during endoscopy for endoscopy lens cleaning and colon irrigation. We critically reviewed all published medical literature and guidelines on the safety of the type of water used in endoscopy. We calculated the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of a 1-L sterile water bottle and compared it to published studies on bottled drinking water. Guidelines recommending sterile water during endoscopy are based on limited evidence and mostly expert opinions. Referenced studies utilize care protocols that are not practiced. There is also considerable cross-referencing of review articles and guidelines. Two clinical studies directly comparing tap and sterile water in gastrointestinal endoscopy found tap water to be a safe and practical cost-saving alternative to sterile water. The calculated carbon footprint of bottled sterile water is 575 g CO2 equivalent. No direct evidence supports the recommendation and widespread use of sterile water during gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures. It contributes to health-care waste and climate change and is costly. We recommend tap water be used to fill sterile water bottles until evidence shows the need for alternative practice. It would be prudent to re-evaluate guidelines and write new ones that consider harm to the environment and society in the provision of care to patients, especially when the intervention may be more harmful than the risk it aims to address."

These antibiotics persist despite their residence time, water treatment, and environmental conditions encountered in drinking water distribution systems. To better understand this phenomenon, the objectives of this study were to determine their degradation kinetics at a residual, sub-minimum inhibitory concentration while exposed to multi-species biofilms in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, as well as examine their effect on total cell count (TCC). The results revealed that both antibiotics continued to be detected after the experimental period of 12 days. Ciprofloxacin concentrations decreased by 31.1% (± 3.9%) and 27.4% (± 7.7%) during exposure to the biofilm and PVC-only control respectively, whereas sulfamethoxazole concentrations decreased by 87.2% (± 15.8%) and 3.6% (± 8.6%) during exposure to the biofilm and PVC-only control, respectively. Biofilm TCC increased significantly when exposed to ciprofloxacin (p-value < 0.005), but showed no significant change when exposed to sulfamethoxazole (p-value > 0.05), which suggested that ciprofloxacin enhanced biofilm formation. These results address the gap in antibiotic persistence research by tracing their concentrations, elucidating the mechanisms of sorption and degradation, and discussing their relative implications. As antibiotics continue to persist in drinking water, their interaction with biofilms may contribute to the long-term selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing potential risks to drinking water safety and public health.

Results of SEM, EDX, FTIR, and XRD analyses confirmed the formation of calcium hydroxide nanoparticles in the CER structure. The fluoride adsorption capacity of NCHO/CER was systematically studied by varying the influencing factors, such as the reaction time, pH level, adsorbent mass, initial concentration, and temperature. The adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order model, while the isotherm curves fitted to the Freundlich model, indicating the occurrence of multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent surface. Moreover, NCHO/CER showed the ability not only to be reused after multiple cycles but also to remove fluoride from actual tap water and groundwater, proving that NCHO/CER is effective for the recovery and reuse of contaminated calcium for fluoride treatment in water."

Simultaneously, increasing attention has been directed toward interfacial hypochlorous acid (HOCl) chemistry, particularly in relation to indoor air quality and public health. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HOCl-mediated oxidation of phospholipids in the presence of OPEs remain unclear. This study utilized an online air-water interface reaction monitoring technique to examine the effects of ten OPEs, including alkyl, chlorinated, and aryl OPEs, on the oxidation of a model lung phospholipid 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG) exposed to HOCl at the air-water interface. The results indicated that OPEs inhibit the oxidation of phospholipids by HOCl at the air-water interface, and this inhibitory effect is correlated with the concentration of OPEs and their water-oil partition coefficient (LogP). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the hydrophilicity of OPEs enables their incorporation into the phospholipid monolayer, resulting in a compact arrangement of POPG. This arrangement partially shields the C=C double bonds from exposure to HOCl, thereby inhibiting the oxidation of POPG at the air-water interface. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which OPEs modulate HOCl-induced phospholipid oxidation, providing a theoretical foundation for the development of specific drugs targeting related diseases."

      "abstract": "Access to clean water remains a critical global challenge, particularly in under-resourced regions. This study introduces an autonomous water treatment system leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies, including advanced smart sensors, real-time monitoring, and automation. The system employs a multi-stage filtration process-mechanical, chemical, and UV sterilization-to treat water with varying contamination levels. Smart sensors play a pivotal role in ensuring precise control and adaptability across the entire process. Experimental validation was conducted on three water types: pond, river, and artificially contaminated water. Results revealed significant reductions in key contaminants such as PPM, pH, and electrical conductivity, achieving water quality standards set by the WHO. Statistical analyses confirmed the system's reliability and adaptability under diverse conditions. These findings underscore the potential of smart, sensor-integrated, decentralized water treatment systems to effectively address global water security challenges. Future research could focus on scalability, renewable energy integration, and long-term operational durability to enhance applicability in remote areas."

      "abstract": "The study addresses the critical issue of accurately predicting ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system, achieving reduced consumption through automatic control technology. NH3-N concentration serves as a key indicator of treatment efficiency and environmental impact; however, its complex dynamics and the scarcity of measurements pose significant challenges for accurate prediction. To tackle this problem, an innovative Transformer-long short-term memory (Transformer-LSTM) network model was proposed, which effectively integrates the strengths of both Transformer and LSTM architectures. The Transformer component excels at capturing long-range dependencies, while the LSTM component is adept at modeling sequential patterns. The innovation of the proposed methodology resides in the incorporation of dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as input variables, along with their respective rate of change and cumulative value. This strategic selection of input features enhances the traditional utilization of water quality indicators and offers a more comprehensive dataset for prediction, ultimately improving model accuracy and reliability. Experimental validation on NH3-N datasets from the SBR system reveals that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing advanced methods in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Furthermore, by integrating real-time sensor data with the Transformer-LSTM network and automatic control, substantial improvements in water treatment processes were achieved, resulting in a 26.9% reduction in energy or time consumption compared with traditional fixed processing cycles. This methodology provides an accurate and reliable tool for predicting NH3-N concentrations, contributing significantly to the sustainability of water treatment and ensuring compliance with emission standards."

The addition of 3.75 wt% of polysaccharide colloids, including curdlan gum (CG), kappa-carrageenan (kC), gellan gum (GEG), guar gum (GUG), high-ester pectin (HEP), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), to the aqueous phase resulted in the formation of a gel structure within it. Furthermore, these polysaccharide colloids reduced the excessive mobility of water droplets under high-temperature conditions. The oil phase consisted of anhydrous butter and a lipophilic nonionic surfactant. The emulsion was subjected to a heat treatment at 95 °C for 30 min, and the emulsions before and after the heat treatment were characterized. The results showed that among the above colloidal emulsions, the 3.75 wt% CG emulsion did not show significant changes in viscosity, stability index, mean particle size, friction coefficient, and encapsulation efficiency before and after heat treatment. The 3.75 wt% CG colloid showed the most significant enhancement in the thermal stability of W/O emulsions. This study proposes a novel fat-replacement strategy for products requiring high-temperature processing, such as processed cheese."

      "abstract": "Radiation therapy has been used to treat cancer; however, the associated DNA damage and adverse effects in the surrounding tissues remain major concerns. In radiation injury, several natural remedies can effectively relieve symptoms with minimal side effects. Cicadidae Periostracum (CP, also called \"Sun-Tae\") is the cast-off shell of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius and has been traditionally used for several pharmacological actions. This study investigated the protective effects of CP water extract (CPE) on irradiated testicular tissue and spermatogenesis. The chemical constituents of CPE were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a mass detector and were determined to be dimeric N-acetyl dopamine derivatives. The testes and epididymal tissues of male C57BL/6 mice orally pretreated with CPE (25 and 50 mg/kg) 24 h and 15 min before radiation exposure (5 Gy) were collected for analysis. CPE pretreatment ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis in the testes and inhibited weight loss in the epididymis compared to those of the irradiated group. Treatment with high-dose CPE prevented the radiation-induced decrease in the epithelial height of seminiferous tubules. In addition, the morphology, motility, and number of damaged sperm cells following radiation exposure were alleviated by CPE treatment. Furthermore, the dose-dependent antioxidative activity of CPE was confirmed in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical scavenging assays, and reactive oxygen species generation by hydrogen peroxide was reduced by CPE treatment in vitro. Our findings suggest that pretreatment with CPE can ameliorate testicular tissue damage and sperm degeneration via the antioxidative properties of CPE in radiation-injured testis tissue."

This study examined the therapeutic effects of metformin combined with coconut water. In this study, twenty male Wistar rats (150-220 g) were divided into four groups: normal control, diabetic control, diabetic treated with metformin, and diabetic treated with metformin plus coconut water. Diabetes was induced using nicotinamide and streptozotocin (STZ), followed by a 21-day oral treatment regimen. Body weight, fasting blood glucose levels, feed, and water intake were measured weekly. A molecular docking study was employed to assess the degree of affinity that compounds of coconut water have for important metabolic proteins. Combination therapies of metformin and coconut water significantly reduced the glucose levels in the blood when compared to the diabetic controls. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between coconut water constituents, particularly chlorogenic acid, and key metabolic proteins, suggesting potential therapeutic effects. The study demonstrates that coconut water, in combination with metformin, effectively ameliorates hyperglycemia and enhances antioxidant enzyme activities in diabetic rats induced with STZ. These results imply that coconut water could serve as a beneficial adjunct treatment for managing DM."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Triclosan is a common antibacterial drug identified as a major contaminant in South African waters, notably in Gauteng and KwaZulu Natal provinces. This contaminant comes from personal care products and pharmaceuticals. It has been frequently detected in local streams and wastewater treatment plants, posing a threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Studies have emphasised the necessity of addressing the presence of triclosan in water bodies to lessen its harmful impacts on the environment. METHODS: In this study, NaAlg/MnSx bio-nanocomposite hydrogel beads incorporated with different amounts of MnS NPs (0.02-0.2 g) were synthesised via the ionic gelation method and employed as an adsorbent for the removal of triclosan from aqueous solutions. The surface charge, morphology, thermal stability, crystallinity, and functional groups of NaAlg/MnS bio-nanocomposite hydrogel beads were characterised by SEM equipped with EDX, TEM, Thermogravimetric analysis, FTIR, XRD, and zeta sizer (mV). RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: The experimental results demonstrated that incorporating 0.02-0.2 g of MnS NPs in the bio-nanocomposite hydrogels led to enhanced mechanical structure, porosity, and swelling ability for the adsorption of triclosan compared to pristine NaAlg hydrogel. The response surface methodology was used to optimise the experimental parameters affecting the batch adsorption of triclosan onto the surface of the adsorbent. Basic pH conditions were suitable for removing triclosan in aqueous solutions via hydrogen bonding with the carboxyl functional groups of the bio-nanocomposite beads. The pseudo-second order, Freundlich, and Sips models better explained the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherm data. The maximum adsorption capacity estimated using the Langmuir isotherm model was 132 mg/g. The thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy (∆H) and entropy (∆S)) were found to be 44.042 kJ/mol and 207.018 J/Kmol, respectively, which means the reaction is endothermic and increases randomisation at the solid/liquid interface. The Gibbs free energy (∆G) was negative throughout the studied temperature range, indicating that the adsorption process was spontaneously and energetically favoured."

      "abstract": "Microplastics originate from the fragmentation of large plastic litter or environmental emissions. These new emerging pollutants not only cause physical harm but also serve as a substrate for other contaminants that adhere to and/or are adsorbed in microplastics. Consumption of these fine particles by organisms may lead to bioaccumulation and bioamplification. Conventional wastewater treatment using inorganic and organic polymeric flocculants is nonbiodegradable and toxic to ecosystem. Plant-derived polysaccharides can provide a highly efficient, nontoxic, and ecofriendly substitute to synthetic flocculants. The microplastic removal efficiency of polysaccharides derived from fenugreek, okra, and the combination of okra and fenugreek in the ratio of 1:1 was studied in simulated and water samples collected from various sources under bench-scale laboratory conditions. Water samples used for the study were collected from surface, ocean, and groundwater sources. A combination of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to study the microplastic removal efficiency of the plant-derived polysaccharides. ζ-Potential measurements and scanning electron microscopy were used to confirm the mechanism and capture of microplastic from water samples. The effect of varying polymer concentrations and contact time was also studied. The best concentration was found to be 1 g/L, with fenugreek showing the best microplastic removal in 30-60 min as the optimum contact time. It was found that fenugreek was the most efficient with an ∼89% microplastic removal from groundwater samples. A combination of okra and fenugreek was the most efficient for freshwater samples with an ∼77% microplastic removal. For the ocean water, okra showed the best removal efficiency of ∼80%. The mechanism of microplastic removal using plant-based polysaccharides as flocculant was found to be bridging. Both experimental and statistical analyses demonstrated that plant-based polysaccharides showed better microplastic removal efficiency than polyacrylamide, which is commercially used for water treatment."

      "abstract": "Background: High-altitude hypoxia is known to adversely affect bone health, leading to accelerated bone loss and metabolic alterations. Recent studies suggest that factors such as bicarbonate and gut microbiota may play key roles in bone health. Mineral water, rich in bicarbonate, may influence bone health and the gut-bone axis under such conditions. Methods: Mice were exposed to hypoxia and treated with different concentrations of drinking water. Bone-related parameters were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and Micro-CT. Bone health was assessed using the measurement of serum biomarkers. Additionally, Untargeted Metabolomics was employed to analyze differential metabolites between groups, while gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: BMW consumption increased bone mineral density (BMD) and helped alleviate the damage to the microstructure of bones caused by hypoxia and delayed the progression of osteoporosis. Additionally, BMW was shown to enhance probiotics such as Akkermansia and Dubosiella and regulate the longevity-regulating pathway as well as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling pathway. This study also discovered changes in metabolic products due to BMW intervention, predominantly in pathways such as the amino acid, prostaglandin, and purine metabolisms, with correlation analysis further exploring the relationships between gut microbiota and these differential metabolites. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to high-altitude hypoxic conditions affects the structure of gut microbiota and bone metabolism in mice. The consumption of BMW improves the structure of gut microbiota and regulates the metabolic pathways to maintain bone health under high-altitude hypoxia.",

Nanomaterials (NMs) sourced from these sustainable macromolecules are emerging as effective solutions for challenges in water treatment and geological waste management. The adsorption capabilities of lignocellulose-based nanomaterials enable the effective removal of 95 % of heavy metals and radionuclides from contaminated soils and geological waste, significantly lowering environmental risks by over 80 %. These materials can achieve an adsorption capacity of up to 600 mg/g for contaminants, including dyes, heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, and organic pollutants like pharmaceuticals and pesticides in water treatment applications. Under optimal conditions, it achieves a removal efficiency of 99 %. Carboxyl and amine-functionalized lignocellulosic nanostructures can show an adsorption rate of up to 40-60 % that can make them more susceptible to targeting specific contaminants. The two materials can be compared, and life cycle assessments may suggest that the use of Lignocellulosic Nanomaterials (LCNMs) is more environmentally friendly than synthetic materials because the former is biodegradable and nontoxic. The major challenges of commercializing these materials are low production cost and long-term stability. This study examines how nanomaterials extracted from lignocellulose are developed alongside operational aspects and ecological effects with specific attention on their ability to deal with worldwide waste and water pollution issues. The research outcomes indicate that these materials have promising applications for green environmental technologies but suggest new solutions to solve existing limitations."

This review evaluated the biogeochemical cycle of Hg in West African ecology and the mitigation of Hg contamination of drinking water sources in the West African region. The study revealed Hg-bearing mineral deposits and artisanal and small-scale gold mining as major sources of Hg in West African environment. West African countries must develop sustainable methods for removing Hg from water. However, bioremediation (including microbial and phytoremediation) and adsorption are promising methods for purifying Hg-contaminated environmental drinking water sources in West Africa. Microorganisms such as Arbuscular mycorrhizal, E. coli, Fusobacterium sp, Trichoderma viride, Gliocladium arborescens, Bascillus sp. and Brevibacterium cysticus have demonstrated the capacity to remediate Hg from the water system. Furthermore, plant species like Paspalum conjugatum, Cyperus kyllingia, and Lindernia crustacea revealed exciting capacity as phytoremediators of Hg. Activated carbon, clay and mineral clays are abundant resources in West Africa that can function as adsorbents for removing Hg during water treatment. However, future studies should focus on optimizing the field-scale application of bioremediation and adsorption methods as mitigation strategies and their long-term benefits in West Africa. It is essential that the government in West Africa fund initiatives and programmes that support the accomplishment of the Minamata Convention agreement, which favours the attainment of the sustainable development goal (SDG-6)."

This study identified the use of hot water for filter backwashing as an effective method for fully eliminating larvae in water treatment facilities. Despite its apparent simplicity, this approach has not been previously explored for larval disinfection. We developed a bench-scale system that utilizes activated carbon and hot water-assisted backwashing. Our research shows that filter backwashing can achieve total disinfection of Chironomus riparius larvae at 45 °C in just 3 min. Furthermore, a cost assessment was conducted to determine the cost efficiency of the designed system for implementation in water treatment facilities. An economic evaluation based on the Bucheon Water Treatment Plant (with a daily flow capacity of 600,000 m3) revealed an additional cost of $3.65 per 1000 m3 of water to ensure effective larval control. This study provides an efficient and environmentally sustainable solution for removing midge larvae from water treatment facilities."

The pristine COF achieves over 95% degradation efficiency and maintains more than 90% of its activity after five cycles, demonstrating excellent stability. Furthermore, functionalization via click chemistry allows the introduction of hydroxyl groups, significantly enhancing its ability to degrade sulfonamide antibiotics, with a removal efficiency of up to 58.9%. Notably, the material functions entirely without metal components or sacrificial additives, offering an environmentally friendly solution for water treatment.

For pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) analysis by solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and due to the high level of organic matter in wastewater, the water samples are filtered consecutively through three filters, a paper filter, a glass microfiber filter of 1 µm, and a Nylon filter of 0.45 µm. This filtration allows the sample's passage through the SPE cartridge to be faster, and there is no cartridge clogging, allowing for greater efficiency in the adsorption process. The big question is whether the PhACs are eliminated during filtration, since they may be adsorbed to organic matter. This work aimed to determine if the best approach for quantifying PhACs in wastewater and surface waters would be to filter them prior or to perform SPE directly. Both approaches analyzed a total of 26 PhACs. Turbidity (TUR) and permanganate index (PI) were determined, and their values were high for samples with a high organic matter content. A statistical analysis was performed to determine the best approach to treat these water samples and whether any correlation existed between PhAC concentrations, PI, and TUR. The PhAC quantification shows a positive correlation with TUR and a negative correlation with PI for most of the target PhACs. However, there are not significantly different results for filtered and not-filtered wastewater samples.",

This paper highlights new innovative materials such as transition metal-modified biochar, zeolites, clays, carbon fibers, graphene, metal organic frameworks, and aerogels. These materials have great potential for the removal of heavy metals from water, particularly due to their large surface area, nanoscale size, and availability of various functionalities; moreover, they can easily be chemically modified and recycled. This paper not only highlights the advantages and ever-improving physicochemical properties of these new types of materials but also critically points out their shortcomings and suggests possible future directions."

This study evaluated the phytochemical composition, antioxidant capacity and anticancer potential of water extracts from in vitro cultivated S. aethiopis. The extract exhibited a high total polyphenol (110.03 ± 0.7 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (7.88 ± 0.25 mg QE/g) content, along with a strong oxygen radical absorbance capacity (an ORAC value of 3677.9 ± 24.8 µmol TE/g). LC-HRMS analysis identified 21 bioactive compounds, including salvianic acid C, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid K and various organic acids. A cytotoxicity evaluation using the Neutral Red Uptake assay showed that the extract had a low toxicity to non-cancerous BALB/3T3 cells. An antiproliferative activity assessment via the MTT assay revealed selective cytotoxicity against Hep G2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (IC50 = 353.8 ± 21.8 µg/mL) and lung (A549) and prostate (PC-3) carcinoma cell lines. Migration assays and cytopathological evaluations confirmed the significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, the suppression of migration and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Flow cytometry revealed considerable increases in apoptotic and necrotic cell populations following treatment with S. aethiopis extract. These findings showed the potential of S. aethiopis as a promising source of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anticancer properties, supporting its further exploration for therapeutic applications.",

      "abstract": "The increasing prevalence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a serious concern for public health. Aeromonas caviae is a pathogenic microorganism that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in fish and humans and is often associated with aquatic environments and isolated from foods and animals. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of the V15T strain isolated from a drinking water storage tank in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The V15T strain has a genome length of 4,443,347 bp with an average G + C content of 61.78% and a total of 4028 open reading frames. Its genome harbors eight types of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) involving resistance to beta-lactamases, macrolides, and quinolones. The presence of blaMOX-6, blaOXA-427/blaOXA-504, and mutations in parC were detected. In addition, other ARGs (macA, macB, opmH, and qnrA) and multidrug efflux pumps (such as MdtL), along with several resistance determinants and 106 genes encoding virulence factors, including adherence (polar and lateral flagella), secretion (T2SS, T6SS), toxin (hlyA), and stress adaptation (katG) systems, were observed. The genome sequence reported here provides insights into antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, evolution, and virulence in Aeromonas strains, highlighting the need for more public health attention and the further monitoring of drinking water systems. Also, the results of physiological and phylogenetic data, average nucleotide identity (ANI) calculation, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) analysis support the inclusion of the strain V15T in the genus Aeromonas as a new subspecies with the proposed name Aeromonas caviae subsp. aquatica subsp. nov. (V15T = P53320T). This study highlights the genomic plasticity and pathogenic potential of Aeromonas within household drinking water systems, calling for the revision of water treatment protocols to address biofilm-mediated resistance and the implementation of routine genomic surveillance to mitigate public health risks."

      "abstract": "The super high-density (SHD) production system has recently been introduced to the Chilean European plum (Prunus domestica L.) industry, but the potential of applying regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) in this system remains unexplored. As irrigation water availability in Chile has been strongly jeopardized by climate change, there is an urgent need to validate water-conserving practices in modern production systems. A field study was conducted in a commercial SHD European plum orchard (cv. French grafted on Rootpac-20 rootstock) for two consecutive seasons in Peralillo, O'Higgins Region, Chile. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a late water deficit (LD) on water productivity, fruit quality, plant water relations, and soil microbiota. The results showed that implementing LD enhanced water productivity by 40% without compromising fresh and dry fruit quality. Moderate to severe water stress induced no changes in physiological parameters such as stomatal conductance and photochemical efficiency. Additionally, the LD treatment significantly reduced soil moisture but increased the abundance of certain groups of beneficial soil microbiota and fine roots. These results highlight the potential of LD as a viable water-conserving practice in modern SHD European plum orchards, particularly in regions facing water scarcity due to climate change."

Effective preservation and pretreatment methods have an important impact on the maintenance of mandarin orange quality. In this study, mandarin orange was pretreated through single and synergistic treatments with ozone water and morpholine fatty acid salts in order to assess their effects on the fruit's physicochemical properties. First, the parameters of the ozone water treatment, including time and ozone water concentration, were optimized to determine the optimal pretreatment conditions for the subsequent mandarin orange preservation. Subsequently, the mandarin oranges subjected to different pretreatments (ozone water, morpholine fatty acid salts, ozone water + morpholine fatty acid salts, water, and blank control) were stored at 25 ± 2 °C and 75% relative humidity for 20 d to simulate retail conditions (shelf-life). Finally, the surface microbial content, firmness, weight loss, total soluble solids content, respiration rate, decay rate, and surface morphology of mandarin orange peel were assessed during the storage period. The results showed that the synergistic treatment with ozone water and morpholine fatty acid salts significantly reduced the surface microbial content (Lg CFU/g = 3.91), weight loss (2.79%), decay rate (2.5%), and firmness losses on day 20 compared to other single treatments (p < 0.05). Hence, synergistic treatment with ozone water and morpholine fatty acid salts is a new green mandarin orange preservation technology with promising applications in controlling postharvest diseases and extending the storage period."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Scientific and rational fertilizer management can not only improve the yield and quality of hazelnut (Corylus heterophylla × Corylus avellana) but also reduce the negative impact on the environment. METHODS: Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology was used to reveal the contents of various metabolites in hazelnut seedlings, and differential metabolites were screened by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). RESULTS: The results showed that a total of 178 up-regulated differential metabolites (Fold change > 1) and 175 down-regulated differential metabolites (Fold change < 1) were detected in 6 comparison groups (DWF0 vs. DWF4, DWF0 vs. DWF5, DWF0 vs. DWF6, DWF4 vs. DWF5, DWF4 vs. DWF6, DWF5 vs. DWF6). Interestingly, the flavonoid metabolic pathway was dramatically enriched, and it was involved in each fertilization combination. The metabolites of the flavonoid pathway in different fertilized and unfertilized groups were compared and analyzed, which displayed that metabolites tricetin, eriodictyol, garbanzol, apigenin, and biochanin A were significantly up-regulated, while garbanzol and astraglin were significantly down-regulated. More interestingly, the determination of flavonoid content and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) displayed that the application of trace element water-soluble fertilizer could significantly enhance the flavonoid content and the expression of genes related to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), with the DWF4 treatment displaying the most significant values. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the application of trace element water-soluble fertilizer (especially the DWF4 treatment) markedly affected the changes in key metabolites of the flavonoid pathway and the expression levels of key genes, thus promoting the growth and development of the hazelnut, which offers an important starting point for future analysis through genetic engineering.",

Growth performance metrics, such as body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR), were recorded weekly. At the end of the trial, the probiotic-fed group had significantly higher BW (p = 0.018), BWG (p = 0.027), and an improved FCR (1.62) compared to the CON (1.74), CA (1.66), and SB (1.70) groups (p = 0.042).

However, the synergistic impact of these approaches on soil hydrothermal environment, maize productivity, water-nitrogen productivity and soil carbon fractions has not been fully understood. A two-year field experiment were conducted in 2020 and 2021 was undertaken in Loess Plateau of China. Six treatments: (i-iii) Conventional flat planting with no nutrient management (CP), with nitrogen fertilizer (CPN), with nitrogen fertilizer and maize straw (CPSN); (iv-vi) ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting with no nutrient management (RF), with nitrogen fertilizer (RFN), with nitrogen fertilizer and maize straw (RFSN). RESULTS: The results showed that the RF, CPN, RFN, CPSN and RFSN significantly improved soil temperature, which showed gradually increased after the seedling stage and slowly decreased at silking to maturity stage in two maize growing period. The dynamics of soil water storage (SWS) varied significantly throughout the six growing periods. The increasing of grain yield and above-ground biomass were highly influenced by ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system and interaction with nitrogen fertilizer and crop straw management. The grain and straw N content, plant N uptake, water productivity also similar with the rank of grain yield and above-ground followed by RFSN>CPSN>FPN>CPN>FP>CP. Furthermore, the RFSN treatment significantly increased the N uptake efficiency (NUPE), agronomy efficiency of N (AEN), and partial factor productivity of N fertilizer (PFPN) compared to RFN, with a mean increase of 29.2%, 44.5% and 7.8% in both growing years. Meanwhile, the RFSN treatment increased DOC by 51.1% (53.2%), EOC by 25.4 % (26.1%), MBC by 96.3% (80.8%), MBN by 52.6% (86.7%) in 2020 (2021), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a result, gray relation analysis and entropy TOPSIS model evaluated that application of maize straw 1.5 t ha-1 and chemical nitrogen fertilizer of 180 kg ha-1 in ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting system (RFSN) serve as a effective method of soil management to enhance water and nitrogen utilization, potentially boosting yields and promoting resource efficiency in the arid regions of the Loess Plateau.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plasma-activated water (PAW) is a recently developed cutting-edge technology that is increasingly gaining interest for its applications in medicine, food industry and agriculture. In plant biology, PAW has been shown to enhance seed germination, plant growth, and plant resilience against biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite increasing knowledge of the beneficial effects exerted by PAW on plants, little information is currently available about how this emerging technology may affect mutualistic plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere. RESULTS: In this work we investigated the impact of irrigation with PAW, generated by a plasma torch, on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Roots of the model legume Lotus japonicus expressing the bioluminescent Ca2+ reporter aequorin responded to treatment with PAW 5' (obtained by 5 min water exposure to plasma) with the immediate induction of cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+ signals, indicating that Ca2+-mediated signalling is one of the earliest cellular responses to PAW. The long-lasting elevations in intracellular Ca2+ levels were not found to alter cell viability. Quantitative analyses of AM fungal accommodation in the host plant roots along with phosphate accumulation in leaves, as well as chemical analysis of N, C, S in shoots, showed that treatments with PAW play a modulatory role on plant AM symbiotic performance, in a manner dependent on the time interval of water exposure to the plasma and on the duration of plant treatment with PAW. In particular, irrigation with PAW 5' increased fungal colonization after 4 weeks, leading to a significant increase in leaf phosphate content after 7 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that PAW enhances AM symbiosis by facilitating early fungal accommodation in roots and subsequently increasing phosphate content in leaves at later stages. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of PAW on the plant microbiome may drive research towards a fine-tuning of this novel green technology to maximize its beneficial effects in the context of a more sustainable agriculture.",

Moreover, these procedures can be performed in an outpatient setting, potentially reducing patients' discomfort. The aim of our randomized trial is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of Transperineal Laser Ablation (TPLATM) and Water Vapor Ablation (WVA) in the treatment of BPH. METHODS: Eighty consecutive patients were randomized 1:1 to the two techniques between January and July 2024. Both procedures were under conscious sedations and patients were same day discharged. All patients underwent standardized follow-up, including International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) and uroflowmetry assessments at 3- and 6-months post-treatment. RESULTS: At 6 months, IPSS and Quality of Life (QoL) scores improved significantly from baseline (p < 0.001), in favor of TPLA at both time points (p ≤ 0.03). General Linear Model analysis showed that QoL improvement was faster in the TPLA group (p: 0.005), though no significant difference persisted at 6 months. Uroflow parameters, including maximum flow, average flow, and post-void residual volume, demonstrated significant improvement without notable differences between the two groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). All patients were same day discharged, except one who required prolonged continuous bladder irrigation. Postoperative complications occurred in 11 cases, with only one (a prostatic abscess) classified as Clavien-Dindo ≥3. The main limitations of the study are the sample size and short follow-up duration. CONCLUSIONS: TPLA and WVA are safe outpatient procedures that provide comparable functional outcomes. However, TPLA appears to offer a faster improvement in patient-reported symptoms."

      "abstract": "The development of a facile and efficient method for the fabrication of ceramic membranes fills a vital gap in the ceramic membrane manufacture research field. Ceramic membranes are relatively high in cost due to the cost of raw materials (metal oxides) as well as the energy required during the sintering stage of the fabrication process. In this study, a ceramic membrane made of low-cost halloysite nanotubular (HNT) clay is fabricated through a die press process and sintered at temperatures notably lower than those required of raw materials in commercial membranes. The features of the membrane were evaluated in terms of chemical properties, surface characteristics, hydrophilicity, durability, oil rejection performance, and antifouling properties. The pore size, porosity, and water permeability corresponding to the optimum membrane composition: halloysite: Al2O3: starch as 60:25:15 wt% were found to be 230 nm, 62.4%, and 1040 LMH/bar, respectively. The membrane demonstrated to be superhydrophilic in air and superoleophobic underwater. The performance tests were conducted with oil emulsions. Oil-water rejection tests were conducted at different concentrations of oil-in-water emulsions (724 and 1014 mg/L) and oil rejection was observed to reach more than 99%. The flux recovery ratio (FRR) of the membrane in the first filtration cycle when treating the lower oil concentration emulsion was 54% greater than the FRR corresponding to the higher oil concentration emulsion. However, in the next filtration cycle, the FRR of the ceramic membrane was 30% greater for the higher oil concentration emulsion which could be attributed to the formation of an oil film, preventing further oil particle penetration in the membrane matrix. The testing with real produced water from gas extraction indicated that the novel HNTs-based ceramic membrane performed well in feed solutions with high total dissolved solids content and can be used for produced water pretreatment before reverse osmosis membranes if the produced water to be desalted. The results from this work show that the developed ceramic membrane could be a promising, low-cost alternative to the ones existing in the current market for oily wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "Fenugreek water, with its natural brilliance and dual magic, shines as a green catalyst for health and beauty. From managing diabetes to rejuvenating skin, discover the science behind this age-old remedy turned modern marvel that shows more detail study on fenugreek water. This study investigates the structural and optical properties of fenugreek water, examining its interactions with sugar solutions, anti-diabetes medications (Diapride M2 Forte), and sunscreen cream (shadow SPF50 + cream) over a period of 3 days. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of soaking fenugreek seed powder in water shows the peak intensity increased significantly from day 1 to day 3 because gel-like mucilage forms. The fenugreek seed powder exhibited broader peaks compared to the more crystalline diabetes medications, reflecting a less organized polysaccharide structure. The optical studies of fenugreek water mixed with sugar solutions (125 mg/dl, 155 mg/dl, and 185 mg/dl) showed that absorbance decreased as sugar concentration increased but increased with higher volumes of fenugreek water, revealing colloidal interactions. On day 1, the absorbance peak was around 250 nm, but days 2 and 3 introduced additional peaks at 350 nm, indicating evolving colloidal particle sizes. When mixed with anti-diabetes drugs, fenugreek water exhibited increased absorbance on day 3, suggesting enhanced interaction. Additionally, fenugreek water showed significant effects on sunscreen cream, with increased absorbance indicating improved UV protection. FTIR analysis revealed that prolonged soaking increases the colloidal formation and bioactive compound concentration, enhancing the health benefits of fenugreek water. The pH of fenugreek water remained relatively stable between  8-9 throughout the study, suggesting minimal impact on the overall effectiveness of the interactions. The findings suggest that fenugreek water plays a crucial role in green catalytic properties that have the potential to reduce diabetes levels and its promising role in enhancing the efficacy of sunscreen creams for skincare treatment, demonstrating the most effective properties for both applications. Also, the study evaluates the UV-blocking and antioxidant properties of fenugreek water, demonstrating its potential as a natural sunscreen additive and free radical scavenger. The observation shows that fenugreek water enhances UV absorption when combined with cream and exhibits peak antioxidant activity on day 2, making it suitable for skincare and pharmaceutical applications.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the activity concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides (NORs) in Nasser Lake water, assess the associated radiological risks, and investigate the potential health and environmental impacts. The presence of these NORs is attributed to both natural geological formations, such as uranium-rich granitic and metamorphic rocks, and anthropogenic activities, including agricultural runoff. Water samples were analyzed for radium-226 (Ra-226), thorium-232 (Th-232), and potassium-40 (K-40). The Ra-226 concentration ranged from 0.08 ± 0.003 to 1.28 ± 0.06 becquerel per liter (Bq/l), mostly between 0.2 and 1.0 Bq/l, reflecting geological and anthropogenic influences. The symbol (±) represents the measurement uncertainty associated with gamma spectrometric analysis. According to international radiation safety guidelines, Ra-226 levels below 1 Bq/l are considered safe for consumption. The Th-232 concentration varied from 0.04 ± 0.001 to 0.96 ± 0.06 Bq/l, showing significant spatial variation. Similarly, K-40 concentrations ranged from 1.35 ± 0.11 to 16.57 ± 1.43 Bq/l, with some notably high values. The annual effective dose (Eff) ranged from 15.8 to 266.15 micro sievert per year (µSv/y) for adults, reaching 362.92 µSv/y for children and 221.54 µSv/y for infants. The doses for children and infants exceeded the recommended thresholds. Cancer risk (CR) assessments showed that men's mortality risks ranged from 2.56 × 10-5 to 4.10 × 10-4, while women's ranged from 2.68 × 10-5 to 4.29 × 10-4. Morbidity risks varied between 3.72 × 10-5 and 5.95 × 10-4 for men and 3.89 × 10-5 to 6.22 × 10-4 for women. These risks correlate with specific lake locations, highlighting hot spots with elevated radioactive content. Water acidity levels (pH) ranged from 6.23 to 7.9, indicating predominantly neutral to slightly alkaline conditions. These variations correlated with electrical conductivity (EC), reflecting complex interaction between pH, EC, and NORs. The study assesses gamma radiation hazards from external exposure and internal risks from alpha-emitting radionuclides, such as Ra-226 and Th-232, through water ingestion. While most samples comply with standard radiation limits, elevated radionuclide levels in certain areas pose potential health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations like children. Continuous monitoring of radiological parameters in Naser Lake is essential to trace long-term trends and ensure safety compliance. Additionally, advanced water treatment methods could help mitigate radionuclide concentrations in affected areas.",

At present, there are almost no effective methods to prevent and treat eye damage caused by microgravity environments. Oxidative stress has been identified as one of the contributing mechanisms of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), and hydrogen (H2) has demonstrated significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has a protective effect against eye injury induced by tail-suspension simulated weightlessness in rats, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In this experiment, we utilized an 8-week tail-suspension model to simulate weightlessness, and employed histopathology, visual electrophysiology, and biochemical indices to evaluate retinal structure, function, and related molecular mechanisms leading to retinal damage. We also assessed the therapeutic efficacy of HRW treatment. Results demonstrated that tail-suspension simulated weightlessness induced thinning of the retinal outer nuclear layer, decreased visual function, and promoted retinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in rats. HRW treatment effectively alleviated the degenerative changes in the retinal outer nuclear layer, improved retinal function, and reduced retinal inflammation in treated rats. Our findings revealed that HRW reduced the retinal oxidative stress response and enhanced mitochondrial function through the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Overall, HRW may be a promising candidate for the treatment of eye injuries in simulated microgravity environments.",

To analyze the physicochemical changes in nanocomposite before and after CR adsorption SEM-EDS, FTIR, XRD, BET, and VSM were employed. The results revealed that Fe3O4-CS/Bent nanocomposite shows significantly enhanced surface area, pore volume, and adsorption capacity compared to pure Fe3O4 NPs, making it highly effective for environmental remediation. Despite its lower magnetization due to non-magnetic additives, it retains superparamagnetic properties that facilitate efficient magnetic separation in water treatment. Furthermore, the mesoporous Fe3O4-CS/Bent nanocomposite can adsorb CR through electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bondings, and surface interaction under carefully optimized adsorption conditions (pH 5, adsorbent amount of 9 mg, and contact time of 25 min) via multivariate analyses. Subsequently, the adsorption process followed a pseudo-2nd order and Langmuir model, yielding a maximum adsorption capacity of 169 mg/g with 96 % removal efficiency, suggesting a monolayer chemisorption process on a relatively heterogeneous surface. The rate constant was determined to be 0.02 g/g-min suggesting a moderate adsorption rate. Thermodynamic analysis indicated adsorption of CR is spontaneous, exothermic, and feasible at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, Fe3O4-CS/Bent exhibits outstanding removal efficiencies in recovery experiments, with 98.6-101.4 % recovery across drinking, tap, canal, and wastewater samples. The adsorbent demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining over 70 % efficiency after 8th regeneration cycle. These findings establish that Fe3O4-CS/Bent nanocomposite is found to be cost-effective environmentally friendly adsorbent for water treatment methods."

      "abstract": "The broad usage of fullerenes nanomaterials and their associated toxicity to non-target organisms makes them an emerging environmental concern. Standard analytical methods to monitor their occurrence in the environment are lacking due to their unique chemical structures, which results in acute hydrophobicity leading to poor chromatographic separation. However, their environmental presence and potential environmental risks necessitate for careful monitoring and risk assessment in wastewater treatment plants and aquatic environments. In this study, a chromatographic technique using an Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with UV-visible detector was used for the separation and quantification of fullerene nanomaterials in wastewater and seawater. The chromatographic separation method developed focused on C60 fullerene, C70 fullerene, [6, 6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (C61-PCBM) and [6,6]- Thienyl- C61- butyric acid methyl ester (C61-TCBM). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy were used to determine the size, shape and absorption wavelength of colloidal fullerene nanomaterials. This method was used for quantification of colloidal fullerene nanomaterials in a wastewater treatment plant and aquatic environments and wastewater treatment plants to assess their risk. The percentage recoveries of fullerene nanomaterials from wastewater, tap water and sea water were investigated for all fullerene nanomaterials C61-PCBM, C61-TCBM, C60 and C70 were 84 %-108 %, 83 %-108 %, 97 %-116 % and 62 %-115 %, respectively. The fullerene nanomaterials C61-PCBM, C61-TCBM and C60 had a linear range at concentrations of 0.25 μg L-1 to 50 μg L-1, with linear regression of 0.9968, 0.9959, 0.9991 and 0.9914, respectively. C70 show a linear range between 0.5 μg L-1 and 10 μg L-1, with linear regression of 0.9914. The limit of detection for C61-PCBM, C61-TCBM, C60, and C70 were 0.0663 μg L-1, 0.0262 μg L-1, 0.0370 μg L-1, and 0.0370 μg L-1, respectively. The developed method was applied to determine the selected fullerene nanomaterials in wastewater and sea water. Their concentrations in wastewater and sea water range from not detected to 2.73 μg L-1 and not detected to 2.05 μg L-1, respectively. The ecological risk assessment carried out on fullerene in the investigated media was found to have no risk to medium risk."

However, a key barrier to optimising biofiltration is the incomplete understanding of the biological mechanisms governing its performance. Despite numerous studies examining how engineering decisions impact biofilter performance and the associated microbiome, the significant influence of geographical location on microbial communities raises the question of whether these findings are universally applicable or location-specific. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis of 15 biofilter microbiomes using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data, mainly originating from rapid gravity and/or granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. Despite different types and scales, results highlight geographical location as the major contributor to microbiome dissimilarity in biofilter samples (Top and Bottom) (R2∼ 0.5; p-value<0.001). The same was observed for influent waters (PERMANOVA R2= 0.76; p-value<0.001), indicating location-specific microbiomes as opposed to differences driven by different biofilter operating parameters. Irrespective of location, the higher percentage of the microbiome was assembled through deterministic processes (∼55 %) compared to stochastic processes (∼45 %). Finally, our findings suggest that the depth stratification of biofilter microbiomes may be associated with the enrichment of taxa capable of metabolising more complex organic carbon in deeper filter layers (10 enriched pathways in biofilter Bottom layers compared to 3 at the Top). These insights provide a broader understanding of biofiltration microbiomes and offer possible research avenues for targeted and effective biofilter design strategies."

      "abstract": "The sanitation of the poultry drinking water system (DWS) is essential to controlling pathogens and biofilms in the DWS. Intervention approaches including several sanitizers have been developed, but there is limited information on the efficacy of some of these sanitizers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of peracid-based (PAB), peroxide-based (PB), and hypochlorite-based (HB) sanitizers against field-isolated Salmonella (10), E. coli (2) and Bacillus (2), along with their antibiofilm effects on six of these bacterial strains on polyvinylchloride (PVC), a common DWS pipe material. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were determined using the microdilution broth method. For biofilm production, PVC rings were inoculated (5-6 Log10 CFU/mL) in buffered peptone water, incubated at 30°C for 48 h, and detached with cotton swabs for quantification. The antibiofilm effect of the sanitizers was further assessed at MIC, 2X-MIC, 4X-MIC, and water (control). Data was analyzed using ANOVA and Least squares in JMP Pro 18. The MIC and MBC of PAB for all isolates ranged from 11.36 to 28.42 ppm, PB from 15.26 to 71.21 ppm, and HB was 106.67 to 350 ppm. Bacillus licheniformis formed the most biofilm (5.39 Log10 CFU/mL) as single-species bacteria while Salmonella attached more (6.36 Log10 CFU/mL) than E. coli (5.41 Log10 CFU/mL) and Bacillus (2.08 Log10 CFU/mL) when grown together in mixed cultures. PAB and HB eliminated the biofilms of all strains tested at MIC in mixed-species cultures while PB had no significant effect. Overall, PAB demonstrated the greatest potential as a DWS sanitizer, showing superior efficacy against planktonic and biofilm cells compared to PB and HB. This research highlights the importance of targeted microbial profiling and sanitizer efficacy testing for pre-harvest pathogen control, providing valuable insights for enhancing food safety in poultry production systems."

      "abstract": "Microplastic (MP) pollution has become a widespread environmental threat which must be addressed as it affects the water bodies, soil as well as air. MPs originally from synthetic textiles, tire abrasion, plastic waste, etc. pose the significant risks to both the environment and health due to its structure, ability to absorb toxins and act as carriers of harmful substances. This characteristic enables MPs to accumulate toxic substances and spread them within the food chain which leads to adverse effects on both the environment and human health including possible endocrine disruption. This problem needs to be solved in order to protect the self-regulatory systems of the environment and safeguard for human health. This review investigates various methods developed to eliminate MPs from water which each method exposes its own strengths and limitations. Conventional methods, such as filtration, coagulation-flocculation, and sedimentation serve as the primary line of defense but often struggle with smaller particles. Membrane filtration, magnetic separation, and electrochemical methods have shown better performance particularly for a wider MPs size range. However, their adoption is limited due to high costs and high energy requirement. A chemical approach focuses on the use of reactors to degrade MPs as a means of overcoming the problem posed by the persistent particles. Biological approaches, including bioremediation through bacteria, fungi, and algae offer eco-friendly alternatives by breaking down MPs into less harmful components. Future directions in MPs management involve the integration of these technologies for enhanced removal efficiency, the development of novel materials, and improved system designs to reduce costs and environmental impact. In summary, advancing research in biotechnological solutions and optimizing existing methods is critical to address the widespread and complex nature of MPs pollution to ensure healthier ecosystems and safer water supplies."

Beginning with advanced fabrication strategies-including plasma treatment, surface grafting, and layer-by-layer assembly-we critically evaluate their efficacy in eliminating surface irregularities and tailoring wettability. Central to this discussion are the types of ionic groups, molecular configurations, and counterion hydration effects, which collectively govern macroscopic hydrophilicity through electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and molecular reorganization. By bridging molecular-level insights with application-driven design, we highlight breakthroughs in oil-water separation, anti-fogging, anti-icing, and anti-waxing technologies, where precise control over ionic group density, the hydration layer's stability, and the degree of perfection enable exceptional performance.

      "abstract": "Advanced water treatment technologies must offer selective, efficient, and cost-effective contaminant removal. In this study, TPB-DMTP-COF-SH, prepared from 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TPB) and 2,5-dimethoxyterephaldehyde (DMTP), was synthesized via a two-step method and applied for the adsorption of aluminum (Al3+), iron (Fe2+), and manganese (Mn2+) ions from water. Adsorption performance was influenced by pH, initial concentration, and contact time, with optimal pH values of 3 for Al3+, 8 for Fe2+, and 10 for Mn2+. The adsorption data followed the Langmuir isotherm model, yielding maximum capacities of 3.27 mg g-1 (Al3+), 8.5 mg g-1 (Fe2+), and 0.67 mg g-1 (Mn2+). Kinetic studies indicated a pseudo-second-order mechanism, suggesting chemisorption as the dominant process. Equilibrium adsorption was reached at 15 min for Al3+ and Mn2+ and 20 min for Fe2+. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that this thiol-functionalized COF not only effectively removes metals but also offers enhanced processability into composite beads and membranes, making it a strong candidate for real-world water treatment applications. These findings highlight TPB-DMTP-COF-SH as a promising and scalable solution for water purification."

Experimental techniques, including chronopotentiometry, current-voltage (I-V) curve measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were employed to investigate the kinetics and dynamics of ion transport at the membrane interface. The results were validated and further explored through finite element method (FEM) simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The study revealed key insights into the role of membrane resistance, ion diffusion, and capacitive effects on overall membrane performance. Parametric analyses of electrolyte layer thickness, bulk solution concentration, and membrane porosity provided guidelines for optimizing membrane design. The findings highlight the importance of considering these factors in enhancing the efficiency and applicability of AEMs in water treatment processes. Future work will focus on refining simulation models and exploring advanced materials to further improve membrane performance."

      "abstract": "A membrane system was applied for ultrapure water production from the treatment of saline effluent from the canned food industry. The industrial effluent presented a high saline concentration, including sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfates, and magnesium. The effluent was treated using a system of reverse osmosis (RO) and a post-treatment process consisting of ion exchange resins (IEXRs). The RO was accompanied by the addition of a hexametaphosphate dose (2, 6, and 10 mg/L) as an antiscalant to avoid the RO membrane scaling by minerals. In turn, IEXRs were used for water deionization to produce ultrapure water with a reduced concentration of monovalent ions. The antiscalant dose was 6 mg/L, producing clean water from RO permeates with an efficiency of 65-70%. The brine from RO was projected for its reuse in food industry processes. The clean water quality from RO showed 20% total dissolved solids (TDS) removal (equivalent to salts). The antiscalant inhibited the formation of calcium salt incrustation > 200 mg/L, showing low fouling. In turn, anionic resins removed 99.8% of chloride ions, whereas the monovalent salts were removed by a mix of cationic-anionic resin, producing ultrapure water with electrical conductivity < 3.3 µS/cm. The cost of ultrapure water production was 2.62 USD/m3."

      "abstract": "Vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) is a promising process for water desalination. However, it suffers some obstacles, such as fouling and wetting, due to the inadequate hydrophobicity of the membrane and high vacuum pressure on the permeate side. Therefore, improving surface hydrophobicity and roughness is important. In this study, the effect of 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFTES) on the morphology and performance of CNM/PAC/PVDF membranes at various concentrations was investigated for the first time. Membrane characteristics such as FTIR, XRD, FE-SEM, EDX, contact angle, and hydrophobicity before and after modification were analyzed and tested using VMD for water desalination. The results showed that the membrane coated with 1 wt.% PFTES had a higher permeate flux and lower rejection than the membranes coated with the 2 wt.% PFTES. The 2 wt.% PFTES enhanced the contact angle to 117° and increased the salt rejection above 99.9%, with the permeate flux set to 23.2 L/m2·h and at a 35 g/L NaCl feed solution, 65 °C feed temperature, a 0.6 L/min feed flow rate, and 21 kPa (abs) vacuum pressure. This means that 2 wt.% PFTES-coated PVDF membranes exhibited slightly lower permeate flux with higher hydrophobicity, salt rejection, and stability over long-term operation. These outstanding results indicate the potential of the novel CNM/PAC/PVDF/PFTES membranes for saline water desalination. Moreover, this study presents useful guidance for the enhancement of membrane structures and physical properties in the field of saline water desalination using porous CNM/PAC/PVDF/PFTES membranes."

Among them are the production of clean water and the combat of climate change, which is strictly linked to the use of fossil fuels as a primary energy source and their related CO2 emissions. Water and energy are strongly interconnected. For instance, when processing water, energy is needed to pump, treat, heat/cool, and deliver water. Membrane operations for water treatment/desalination contribute to the recovery of purified/fresh water and reducing the environmental impact of waste streams. However, to be sustainable, water recovery must not be energy intensive. In this respect, this contribution aims to illustrate the state of the art and perspectives in desalination by reverse osmosis (RO), discussing the various approaches looking to improve the energy efficiency of this process. In particular, the coupling of RO with other membrane operations, like pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO), reverse electrodialysis (RED), and forward osmosis (FO), as well as the osmotic-assisted reverse osmosis (OARO) system, are reported. Moreover, the possibility of coupling a membrane distillation (MD) unit to an RO one to increase the overall freshwater recovery factor and reduce the brine volumes that are disposed is also discussed. Specific emphasis is placed on the strategies being applied to reduce the MD thermal energy demand, so as to couple the production of the blue gold with the fight against climate change."

      "abstract": "Hydrogel-based wastewater treatment technologies show certain outstanding features, which include exceptional efficiency, sustainability, reusability, and the precise targeting of specific contaminants. Moreover, it becomes possible to minimize the environmental impact when using these materials. Their flexibility, low energy consumption, and adaptability to meet specific requirements for different purposes offer significant advantages over traditional methods like activated carbon filtration, membrane filtration, and chemical treatments. Recent advancements in hydrogel technology, including new production methods and hybrid materials, enhance their ability to efficiently adsorb contaminants without altering their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Therefore, innovative materials that are ideal for sustainable water purification were developed. However, these materials also suffer from several limitations, mostly regarding the scalability, long-term stability in real-world systems, and the need for precise functionalization. Therefore, overcoming these issues remains a challenge. Additionally, improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of regeneration methods is essential for their practical use. Finally, assessing the environmental impact of hydrogel production, use, and disposal is crucial to ensure these technologies are beneficial in the long run. This review summarizes recent advancements in developing polymer-based hydrogels for wastewater treatment by adsorption processes to help us understand the progress made during recent years. In particular, the studies presented within this work are compared from the point of view of the synthesis method, raw materials used such as synthetic/natural or hybrid networks, and the targeted class of pollutants-dyes or heavy metal ions. In several sections of this paper, discussions regarding the most important properties of the newly emerged adsorbents, e.g., kinetics, the adsorption capacity, and reusability, are also discussed."

Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: Control; Nobiletin (NOB); Chronic Stress (CS); Chronic Stress+DMSO (CS+DMSO); and Chronic Stress+Nobiletin (CS+NOB). Healthy testicular morphology was seen in the Control and NOB groups. In the CS group, seminiferous tubule diameters and germinal epithelial thicknesses decreased, and basement membranes were thicker. This morphological damage was reduced in the CS+NOB group. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that anti-ZO-1 expression, which was intense in the Control and NOB groups, decreased in the CS group, and increased in CS+NOB, similar to Control and NOB. Electron microscopy indicated that the blood-testis barrier (BTB) maintained its integrity in the Control and NOB groups, lost its integrity in the CS group, and was largely preserved in CS+NOB. Biochemical analyses showed that oxidative stress markers, significantly increased in the CS group, decreased significantly in the CS+NOB group. These findings underscore the protective effect of NOB on the male reproductive system against chronic stress, suggesting that nobiletin might be a valuable supportive agent in the treatment of male infertility."

Current implantable prostheses incorporating multi-component architectures to replicate the functional heterogeneity of natural intervertebral discs (IVD) face challenges in achieving mechanical and physiological compatibility. Inspired by the natural IVD's structure, where a soft nucleus pulposus (NP) is encased by a tough annulus fibrosus (AF), a water transport-modulated directional annealing casting (DAC) approach has been developed to construct bulk hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties (up to ≈36.69 MPa compressive strength with ≈5.35 MPa modulus). This strategy enables the fabrication of an integrated hydrogel-based IVD (H-IVD) with biomechanically gradient structures, featuring a high-strength AF region (compressive modulus ≈2.77 MPa) seamlessly transitioning to a compliant NP core (modulus ≈0.26 MPa) while maintaining physiological water content throughout. The H-IVD exhibits excellent biocompatibility and load-bearing capacity, with inherent stress-sensing capabilities enabling dynamic functional assessment of spinal biomechanics. Furthermore, this integrated design strategy demonstrates broad applicability for engineering various dimensionally-controlled biomimetic tissues, from simple 1D structures to complex 3D organs requiring precise spatial control of material properties."

DESIGN: Experimental, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Thirty volunteers training MMA (age: 28.20 ± 7.57 years, BMI: 26.35 ± 4.06, training experience: 10.37 ± 7.34) were randomized to two groups: experimental (n = 15) and control (n = 15). In the first phase, the experimental group underwent GRT and the control-game-ready sham therapy (GRS). After a 2-week break, the experimental group underwent CWT and the control-contrast water sham therapy (CWS). The main outcome measures were muscle tone (T) stiffness (S) elasticity (E), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and maximum isometric strength (Fmax) assessed before therapy (Rest) and 5-min and 1-h after treatment (PostTh5min and PostTh1h). RESULTS: Analysis of variance results for T, S, E, PPT, and Fmax showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.0001) for main effects and interactions. For both therapies GRT and CWT: T, S, and E were lower 5 min after therapy and 1 h after therapy compared to Rest (interaction effect, p < 0.00001). For both therapies GRT and CWT the PPT and Fmax were higher 5min and 1 h after therapy compared to Rest (interaction effect, p < 0.0001). The post hoc test showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.0001) for T, S, E, PPT, and Fmax in the experimental groups (GRT and CWT) for Rest-PostTh5min and Rest-Post1h. No statistically significant differences were found for Post5mi-Post1h. The effect size of Cohen's d for S, E, PPT, and Fmax showed similar values, with only T being significantly more pronounced in the GRT group (large, d > 0.8). There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the control groups (GRT for GRS and CWT for CWS) in the Rest-PostTh5min-PostTh1h range. CONCLUSION: The positive impact of both contrast therapy strategies as a stimulus influencing important aspects of biomechanics was confirmed. The results showed similar effects of CWT and GRT (both similarly lowering S and E and increasing Fmax and PPT) except for the analysis of muscle tone, where the lowering effect of GRT had larger effect. These findings can be directly applied by researchers, sports medicine specialists, and martial arts trainers interested in the biomechanical effects of therapy on athletes, improving their understanding and practice."

The objective of this study was to analyze the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the population regarding water pollution in the mining areas of Siguiri, Guinea. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 15 to June 15, 2023, on the population of Doko, Siguiri. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to water pollution in artisanal mining areas. Logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with KAP. RESULTS: The survey included 501 respondents. Good knowledge of water pollution was observed in 53% of respondents, while 52% exhibited a positive attitude towards water pollution in artisanal mining area. Good practices were reported by 81% of respondents. The multivariate analysis showed that being educated (ORa: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.39; 3.29) and being a foreigner (ORa: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.04; 3.51) significantly associated with positive attitudes towards water pollution in artisanal mining area. Indeed, being single (aOR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.10; 3.14), having good knowledge of water pollution (aOR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.47; 4.36) and lack of lifestyle (tobacco and alcohol) (aOR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.02; 5.97) were significantly associated with good practices. CONCLUSION: This study revealed moderate knowledge, positive attitudes and adequate practices regarding water pollution in Siguiri's artisanal mining areas. However, significant gaps remain, including a lack of awareness of the risks associated with prolonged exposure to heavy metals. She advocates an integrated approach combining education, awareness-raising and technical support, accompanied by concrete solutions such as water treatment and the strengthening of community initiatives, in order to convert this knowledge into sustainable behavior.",

Therefore, developing advanced membrane separation technologies is crucial. While membrane separation technology holds promise as a solution, its widespread applicability necessitates overcoming significant obstacles related to corrosion resistance, alkali resistance, and the prevention of membrane fouling. This study presents a novel and highly efficient approach for oil-water separation, employing bioinspired, nanoporous metal-organic framework-modified basalt fiber fabrics (BFF). The integration of UiO-66-NH2, renowned for its high porosity and tunable functionalities, with a chitosan-dopamine (CS-DA) layer on BFFs creates a multifunctional membrane with enhanced hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity. This bioinspired design (refers to engineering solutions that mimic natural structures or mechanisms to improve performance and efficiency), drawing inspiration from the structure and function of natural materials, results in superior oil-water separation performance, demonstrating excellent flux and oil rejection rates. The UiO-66-NH2 effectively captures oil droplets due to its high porosity, while the CS-DA layer facilitates water permeability and promotes surface stability. Furthermore, the composite membrane exhibits exceptional stability and reusability, positioning it as a promising candidate for efficient and sustainable oil-water separation applications.

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy identified MPs, while inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry quantified heavy metals. Results revealed that polyethylene, polystyrene, polyamide, and polypropylene were the predominant polymers, with Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Ni adsorbed on their surfaces. Iron (Fe) exhibited the highest concentration, reaching 84 µg.L⁻¹ in CHWRs and 85 µg.L⁻¹ in the distribution network. In CHWRs the highest percentage (61%) of size of MPs were between 500 and 1000 μm, while in water distribution network maximum range of obtained MPs were between 50 and 100 μm. The average concentration of the other detected heavy metals were as: zinc (Zn) 43.9 µg.L- 1 and 7.75 µg.L- 1, manganese (Mn) 11.48 µg.L- 1 and 6.5 µg.L- 1, arsenic (As) 20.22 µg.L- 1 and 0.26 µg.L- 1, cadmium (Cd) 3.16 µg.L- 1 and 2.8 µg.L- 1, copper (Cu) 15.18 µg.L- 1 and 0.03 µg.L- 1, and nickel (Ni) 0.10 µg.L- 1 and 2.25 µg.L- 1 in distribution network and CHWRs, respectively. World Health Organization recommended the permissible limit of these cations in drinking water as 10 µg.L- 1 for As, 5 µg.L- 1 for Cd, 50 µg.L- 1 for Cr, 20 µg.L- 1 for Ni, 10 µg.L- 1 for Mn, 500 µg.L- 1 for Zn, 300 µg.L- 1, 2000 µg.L- 1 for Cu and 300 µg.L- 1 for Fe. The study highlights MPs as carriers of toxic heavy metals, presenting significant health and environmental risks. This novel research emphasizes the impact of secondary pollution and water treatment processes on MP fragmentation and HM contamination. Recommendations include adopting enhanced water treatment protocols to mitigate MP and HM risks, implementing stricter quality monitoring at all stages of water distribution, and promoting public awareness of plastic pollution. Future studies should explore the health effects of MPs and HMs, optimize sampling methods, and focus on long-term monitoring under diverse environmental conditions to address this emerging issue comprehensively."

An in-depth characterization of Pb2+ -loaded adsorbents was carried out to understand the changes that might have happened in their functional groups, surface morphology, elemental composition, and surface charge, due to adsorption. Further, Langmuir, Freundlich, and One-site-specific binding models were applied to investigate the effects of environmental parameters namely, temperature, pH, and initial Pb2+ concentrations on adsorption kinetics. Amongst all the adsorbents, polysaccharides exhibited the rapid removal efficiency of Pb2+, which might be attributed to the presence of functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups in polysaccharides facilitating efficient Pb2+ adsorption. EPS demonstrates a high potential for rapid Pb2+ capture due to its high density of binding sites and substantial capacity. Box-Behnken model optimization confirms that pH and Pb concentrations in its environment significantly influence Pb2+ adsorption. Overall, this study underscores the efficacy of cyanobacteria in bioremediation applications, offering a sustainable and effective approach to mitigating heavy metal contamination in water systems and contributing to develop more efficient wastewater treatment solutions."

      "abstract": "Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) presents a promising approach for sustainable water denitrification. Yet its practical implementation is hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we develop a nitrogen-doped carbon supported cobalt-copper dual-atom catalyst (CoCu-NC DAC) to significantly enhance the electro-catalytic NO3RR performance. The optimized CoCu-NC DAC demonstrates exceptional activity, achieving a faraday efficiency of 95.3 % and a high NH4+ yield rate of 2.41 mg h-1 cm-2 at -0.6 VRHE, surpassing the performance of conventional Cu/Co single-atom catalysts. In-situ analysis and density functional theory calculations confirm that the synergistic effects arising from (1) optimized electronic structure for balanced intermediate adsorption, and (2) enhanced surface H concentration facilitating NOx hydrogenation. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the DACs, but also offers a practical solution for groundwater nitrate remediation, opening new avenues for the application of atomically dispersed catalysts."

      "abstract": "With the growing demand for urban water, reclaimed water is a key solution for mitigating shortages. However, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can act as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs), posing environmental and public health risks. This study systematically investigated the distribution and co-selection mechanisms of ARGs and VFs across four treatment stages in five WWTPs in Nanjing over two years, with a focus on high-risk efflux pump-related ARGs. A total of 902 persistent ARGs and 1086 persistent VFs were identified, including 12 characteristic ARGs, 12 characteristic VFs, and 20 high-risk priority ARGs. Network analysis and linear regression revealed a significant correlation between efflux pump ARGs and VFs, particularly those linked to outer membrane proteins, pili, and iron ion transport. Their coexistence suggests potential selective advantages during wastewater treatment. Laboratory-simulated aquatic environment experiments, RT-qPCR, and virulence protein assays further confirmed the co-selection between resistance and virulence. Results demonstrated that environmental stress, including antibiotics, heavy metals, and disinfection, induces efflux pump overexpression, enhancing bacterial pathogenicity. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring high-risk efflux pump ARGs in reclaimed water safety. Targeted surveillance and advanced treatment strategies are crucial for controlling antibiotic resistance and ensuring safe water reuse."

In this paper, the water-soluble anthracenyl-modified oxacalix[4]arene(AO3) was synthesized by converting four imine groups and ester groups of anthracenyl-modified oxacalix[4]arene (AO1) to amine groups and hydrophilic carboxyl groups respectively via reduction and alkaline hydrolysis reactions. Afterwards, the folic acid was bonded to the AO3 via amidation reaction, and the folic acid-functionalized water-soluble anthracenyl-modified oxacalix[4]arene (FA-AO3) with targeting recognition of cancer cells MCF-7 was prepared. The modification of folic acid made FA-AO3 have an obvious redshift phenomenon by 30 nm and significant increase in fluorescence intensity. When normal cells (HUVEC cells) and cancer cells (MCF-7 cells) were cultured with FA-AO3 respectively, obvious green fluorescence could be observed in cancer cells, while fluorescence phenomenon didn't happen in normal cells, indicating that FA-AO3 had a good specificity to recognize human breast cancer cells. FA-AO3 would have potentially valuable application in early cancer diagnosis and can also be as a drug carrier for specific targeted therapy in the future."

      "abstract": "Ensuring universal access to safe drinking water remains a global challenge, especially in semi-arid regions facing water scarcity, pollution, inadequate infrastructure, and rapid urbanization. The present study aimed to assess drinking water quality by analysing antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and their spatial distribution, identifying contamination hotspots using integrated physicochemical, microbial, and advanced geospatial assessments on 122 samples collected from surface and groundwater of semi-arid areas with key physicochemical parameters analysed using standard methods. Microbial contamination was assessed through heterotrophic plate counts and coliform tests, detecting E. coli (n = 83 isolates) that underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing via the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against eleven antibiotics. Results showed that several key physicochemical (total dissolved solids, alkalinity, fluoride, and calcium) and microbial parameters exceeded WHO permissible limits. Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships among water quality indicators in both water sources. Advanced geospatial techniques, including Empirical Bayesian Kriging and Getis-Ord Gi cluster analysis, enabled spatial interpolation of studied parameters and identified significant antibiotic-resistant E. coli clusters in 15 wards. The antibiogram showed high resistance levels, with 91.6% of isolates resistant to oxacillin, 83.1% to amoxicillin, and 63.9% to ciprofloxacin, complemented by the Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Index reaching up to 0.83 indicating a high risk of contamination. Spatial-cluster analysis pinpointed high-risk areas exhibiting significant antibiotic-resistant E. coli clusters. This integrated approach underscores the urgent need for improved water treatment, antimicrobial resistance surveillance, and infrastructure upgrades to mitigate contamination risks in drinking water systems of rapidly urbanizing semi-arid regions worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, and despite extensive research, no disease-modifying drugs are currently available. Various rehabilitation approaches, natural healing factors, and curative agents are commonly used for osteoarthritis management. A key question remains whether treatments involving mud and mineral water therapies in resort-based sanatoriums are more effective than conventional rehabilitation procedures. To address this, we analyzed clinical trials since 2000 that compared the effects of balneotherapy and peloid therapy, either alone or in combination, with standard rehabilitative thermal interventions in managing peripheral joint osteoarthritis. A systematic review of 40 controlled trials from PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro, and Web of Science evaluated the effects of these therapies on osteoarthritis patients. The inclusion criteria were guided by the PICO model, focusing on various mineral water and mud therapies versus routine rehabilitation. All assessed outcomes were included in the intergroup analysis. Most studies focused on knee osteoarthritis, with 62.7% of participants being female. Significant intergroup differences were found in improvements in pain, stiffness, and physical performance, with better long-term outcomes observed in patients receiving mineral water or mud therapy compared to controls. In conclusion, while standard rehabilitation thermal procedures have a proven positive effect on reducing osteoarthritis symptoms and improving quality of life, sanatorium treatments with mud and mineral water therapies offer additional advantages, especially in terms of long-lasting benefits."

      "abstract": "Beer has been a popular beverage for millennia. As water is a main component of beer and the brewing process, we surmised that the polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) presence and spatial variability in drinking water systems are a PFAS source in beers. This is the first study to adapt EPA Method 533 to measure PFAS in beer from various regions, brewery types, and water sources. Statistical analyses were conducted to correlate PFAS in state-reported drinking water, and beers were analyzed by brewing location. PFAS were detected in most beers, particularly from smaller scale breweries located near drinking water sources with known PFAS. Perfluorosulfonic acids, particularly PFOS, were frequently detected, with PFOA or PFOS above U.S. EPA's Maximum Contaminant Limits in some beers. There was also a county-level correlation between the total PFAS, PFOA, and PFBS concentrations in drinking water and beers. Given that approximately 18% of U.S. breweries are located within zip codes with detectable PFAS in municipal drinking water, our findings, which link PFAS in beer to the brewery water source, are intended to help inform data-driven policies on PFAS in beverages for governmental agencies, provide insights for brewers and water utilities on treatment needs, and support informed decision-making for consumers."

This study investigates the impact of collected and recycled concrete plant washing water on the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of mortars. Two types of wastewater were analyzed: (1) collected water (CW), obtained from settling tanks with residual suspended particles and chemical compounds, and (2) recycled water (RW), subjected to a complete treatment process including pH stabilization and solid particle removal. The effects of these waters were compared against potable water (PW) through a comprehensive experimental program evaluating the porosity, density, shrinkage, and mechanical performance of mortars. The results indicate that using CW and RW leads to increased porosity, higher shrinkage, and a reduction in compressive and flexural strength, with RW having a more pronounced impact. These changes are attributed to the chemical composition of the water, which affects cement hydration and matrix densification. Despite these drawbacks, the proper treatment and controlled usage of such waters may offer sustainable alternatives to potable water in concrete production, contributing to resource conservation and environmental sustainability."

The study employed the Central Composite Design (CCD) method through bottle tests to evaluate the effect of different compounds on the gelation time and duration of syneresis. To explore the effectiveness of the xanthan-based hydrogels, swelling tests as well as dynamic core flooding tests are performed. Additionally, to enlighten the performance of the xanthan hydrogels, comprehensive set of characterization tests are performed. Nevertheless, the swelling test results indicated that increasing the polymer concentration led to an increase in swelling. SEM images of the dried hydrogel confirmed the structural integrity and uniformity of the networked architecture, demonstrating an increase in thickness and density. Furthermore, four hydrogel samples with the most appropriate specification in the bottle and swelling tests were chosen for core flooding tests. The results demonstrated that injecting the sample including; polymer@8000ppm, crosslinking agent ratio@0.15, and nanosilica@0.05 wt%, as an optimal sample, caused a 71.9% decrease in water production. Finally, the residual factor of 2.289, indicated the effective efficiency of xanthan-chromium hydrogel in the presence of nanosilica to reduce water permeability compared to oil in sandstone reservoir."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Prolonged fasting (PF), defined as abstaining from energy intake for ≥4 consecutive days, has gained interest as a potential health intervention. However, the biological effects of PF on the plasma proteome are not well understood. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of a medically supervised water-only fast (mean duration: 9.8 ± 3.1 days), followed by 5.3 ± 2.4 days of guided refeeding, in 20 middle-aged volunteers (mean age: 52.2 ± 11.8 years; BMI: 28.8 ± 6.4 kg/m2). RESULTS: Fasting resulted in a 7.7% mean weight loss and significant increases in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), confirming adherence. Untargeted high-dimensional plasma proteomics (SOMAScan, 1,317 proteins) revealed multiple adaptations to PF, including preservation of skeletal muscle and bone, enhanced lysosomal biogenesis, increased lipid metabolism via PPARα signaling, and reduced amyloid fiber formation. Notably, PF significantly reduced circulating amyloid beta proteins Aβ40 and Aβ42, key components of brain amyloid plaques. In addition, PF induced an acute inflammatory response, characterized by elevated plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), hepcidin, midkine, and interleukin 8 (IL-8), among others. A retrospective cohort analysis of 1,422 individuals undergoing modified fasting confirmed increased CRP levels (from 2.8 ± 0.1 to 4.3 ± 0.2 mg/L). The acute phase response, associated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling, was accompanied by increased platelet degranulation and upregulation of the complement and coagulation cascade, validated by ELISAs in blood and urine. CONCLUSIONS: While the acute inflammatory response during PF may serve as a transient adaptive mechanism, it raises concerns regarding potential cardiometabolic effects that could persist after refeeding. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the long-term molecular and clinical implications of PF across diverse populations."

The findings revealed that PAW treatment, particularly the 3-min immersion method, led to a substantial enhancement in the quality of the stored carrots. Specifically, the PAW-3 min group decreased by 20.08 %, 55.34 %, and 52.66 % in L*, a*, and b* values respectively (comparing storage days 7 d to 0 d). Notably, the PAW-3 min group demonstrated the least decrease in brightness and exhibited superior yellow color retention compared to the other treatment groups. Concerning weight, a 4.86 % decrease was observed in the PW group from day 0 to day 7 of storage, while the PAW-5 min group exhibited a 2.06 % decrease, suggesting that prolonging the PAW treatment time enhances the retention of sample weight. With regard to hardness, the PAW-3 min group exhibited the least weight loss of 4.62 % among all the treatment groups. The H2O2, a reactive oxygen content, increased from 6.22 ± 0.26 μmol/g to 10.55 ± 0.13 μmol/g with the extension of PAW treatment time, achieving an enzyme inhibition of browning, thus controlling water evaporation and microbial activity. The study demonstrated that PAW ensured uniform water distribution, activated the antioxidant system, and promoted phenolic compound synthesis. It was determined that extended treatment times resulted in cellular damage, and that shorter PAW treatment times (1 to 3 min) were optimal. The findings of this study suggest that this non-chemical method is effective in extending the shelf-life of FCC."

Groups 3 and 4 were exposed to a cigarette smoking treatment with one of the natural antioxidants (vitamin C, Ammi Visnagia seed extract, respectively). Rats in group 5 were exposed to flavored water-pipe smoke resulting from the complete burning of 20 g from one coastal for 30 days, one session a day, and groups 6-7 were exposed to cigarette smoking with treatment with one of the selected natural antioxidants (Ascorbic acid vitamin C, Ammi Visnagia seed extract). According to immunohistochemistry investigations, smoking exposure has been linked to negative tissue consequences. Both types of smoking models induced the expression of the p53 protein in heart and lung tissues. However, p53 was mildly expressed in the heart and considerably in the lung. In conclusion, investigations were conducted on the impact of smoking on different levels, such as histological changes in the trachea, lung, and heart ventricle, as well as its influence on the expression of the p53 protein. The administration of Ammi Visnaga seed extract and Ascorbic acid exhibited protective effects against the detrimental effects of smoking through all the aforementioned methods.",

      "abstract": "The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is widely cultivated in yellow sand substrate-based systems in Northwest China, contributing significantly to regional agriculture. However, suboptimal water and fertilizer management hinders the balanced optimization of yield, fruit quality, and resource efficiency. In this two-year solar greenhouse experiment (2023-2024), we employed a four-factor, three-level orthogonal design [L9(34)] to examine three irrigation regimes-full irrigation (FI 100% of crop evapotranspiration, [ETc]), mild deficit irrigation (DIM 75% ETc), and severe deficit irrigation (DIS 50% ETc)-in combination with staged fertilizer applications at the seedling, flowering/fruit-set, and peak-fruit stages. A multi-objective decision-making framework, integrating an improved entropy weight method with a virtual-ideal-solution-based TOPSIS model, was established to address the complexity of water-fertilizer interactions. The results indicated that irrigation amount (IA) was the primary determinant of yield and water use efficiency (WUE), followed by fertilizer application in the second stage (FII). For fruit quality indices (moisture content, vitamin C (VC), lycopene (LC), soluble sugars (SSs), and soluble solids content (SSC)), IA remained the most influential factor, followed by FIII, FII, and FI; IA also had the largest impact on fruit hardness (Hd), soluble protein (SP), and titratable acidity (TA). An integrated scoring analysis revealed that treatment T5 achieved the highest yield, WUE, and partial factor productivity (PFP), whereas T7 excelled in fruit quality (VC, LC, SSC, and SP). Moreover, TOPSIS confirmed T5 as the optimal water-fertilizer strategy to achieve high yield, improved quality, and efficient resource utilization. Overall, these findings underscore a robust approach for optimizing water-fertilizer coupling in tomato cultivation under yellow sand substrate conditions, thereby enhancing resource use efficiency, promoting sustainable greenhouse agriculture in arid regions, and contributing to national water-saving and yield-increasing priorities."

Brassinosteroids (BRs) is a group of phytohormones that have been used to enhance wheat drought tolerance. Wheat cultivars with different adaptation strategies could have their own specific drought tolerance mechanisms, and could react differently to treatment with growth regulators. In this work, the effect of seed pretreatment with 0.4 µM 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) was investigated in two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars contrasting in drought behavior, tolerant Ekada 70 (cv. E70) and sensitive Zauralskaya Zhemchuzhina (cv. ZZh), in early ontogenesis under dehydration (PEG-6000) or soil drought conditions. EBR pretreatment mitigated the stress-induced inhibition of seedling emergence and growth, as well as membrane damage in cv.E70 but not in ZZh. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed substantial changes in hormonal balance associated with ABA accumulation and a drop in the levels of IAA and cytokinins (CKs) in drought-subjected seedlings of both cultivars, especially ZZh. EBR-pretreatment reduced drought-induced hormone imbalance in cv. E70, while it did not have the same effect on ZZh. EBR-induced changes in the content of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) belonging to the protective proteins in E70 seedlings suggest its contribution to EBR-dependent adaptive responses. The absence of a detectable protective effect of EBR on the ZZh cultivar may be associated with its insensitivity to pre-sowing EBR treatment."

The Study demonstrated that the duration of plasma-activated water treatment most significantly diminished fungal presence, followed by water flow rate and the argon-to-combined gas ratio. Plasma-activated water eliminated 2.6 logarithmic units of fungi across multiple experimental regimens. Plasma diminished water flow, further reducing A. flavus fungus. Extending activated water application from 1 to 10 min diminished A. flavus by 1.17 logs. The research revealed that 1O2, NO3-, and H2O2 influenced the GPI receptor in distinct manners. The quantity of hydrogen bonds between molecular GPI and the solvent in H2O2 exhibited a wider variety of effects than the two free radicals. The Study indicates that plasma-activated water eradicates A. flavus fungus by targeting the GPI receptor."

The application of chemical water treatment via heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes using peroxide (O-O) represents a potentially attractive treatment option. These processes serve to initiate redox processes at the solid-water interface. Nevertheless, the oxidation mechanism exemplified by the typical Fenton-like persulfate-based heterogeneous oxidation, in which electron transfer dominates, is almost universally accepted. Here, we present experimental results that challenge this view. At the solid-liquid interface, it is demonstrated that protons are thermodynamically coupled to electrons. In situ quantitative titration provides direct experimental evidence that the coupling ratio of protons to transferred electrons is almost 1:1. Comprehensive thermodynamic analyses further demonstrate that a net proton-coupled electron transfer occurs, with both protons and electrons entering the redox cycle. These findings will inform future developments in O-O activation technologies, enabling more efficient redox activity via the tight coupling of protons and electrons."

The clinical data of adult patients receiving MHD treatment at 18 hemodialysis centers in Guizhou Province from June to August in 2021 and the same period in 2022 were collected. Physical measurements, body composition measurements, and questionnaire surveys were performed. Psychological assessment was conducted using the Beck Depression Inventory, with a score of 14 or above indicating the presence of depressive symptoms. Patients were divided into four groups based on the quartiles of the ECW/ICW ratio, and the relationship between the ECW/ICW ratio and depressive symptoms in MHD patients was explored using logistic regression analysis. Subgroup analyses were further conducted to assess the stability of the results. Results: A total of 3 195 patients were included in the study, consisting of 1 979 males and 1 216 females, with a median (Q1, Q3) age of 55 (45, 65) years. According to the Beck Depression Inventory, approximately 11.1% (355/3 195) had depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, in the unadjusted model, the risk of depression for patients in the highest ECW/ICW quartile (Q4) was 2.24 times higher than that of the lowest quartile (Q1) (OR=2.24, 95%CI: 1.62-3.08, P<0.001). After further adjustment for covariates such as gender, age, hypertension, and diabetes, the risk of depression for patients in Q4 remained 1.75 times higher than that of Q1 group (OR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.20-2.54, P=0.003). The independent association between a high ECW/ICW ratio and the risk of depression was stable across different age groups, genders, education levels, and in the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke history (all P for interaction>0.05). Conclusion: An increased ECW/ICW ratio is associated with an increased risk of depression in MHD patients.",

The device maintains high stability under complex environments and long-time operating conditions, and realizes simultaneous multi-parameter detection and automation of the detection process through IoT control and embedded design, thus facilitating timely monitoring and intervention in the fisheries environment. Using low concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and nitrite as research objects, the data collected by a multi-channel spectral sensor was used to classify the water health level, and the experimental results showed that the accuracy of the device's detection was as high as 96.8 percent, while the manufacturing cost was only $60. Overall, this interdisciplinary approach combining spectral analysis, device development, and machine learning provides a promising solution for efficient water quality monitoring and management in aquaculture."

Also, the sensor is utilized at wide pH range (4-10) for the determination of ClO-. TBCP showed outstanding selectivity for ClO- over other competing analytes via a fluorescent response change from colorless to orange, and its response mechanism was based on a deprotonation phenomenon. The ClO- level was successfully determined by TBCP on test kits, cotton swabs and in real samples. Fluorescent bio-imaging of ClO- in HEPG2 cells was also carried out in the presence of TBCP. Furthermore, DFT calculations were performed successfully for TBCP and TBCP + ClO- complex."

      "abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a lipid mediator modulating several aspects of kidney function. PGE2 acts via four prostanoid receptors, EP1 to EP4. In renal tubules, EP4 has very low expression, yet a role for EP4 in maintaining water balance has been proposed. The major aim of this study was to clarify the role of the EP4 receptor in the kidney tubule of adult mice for body water homeostasis. To examine this, a mouse model with doxycycline-dependent deletion of EP4 along the renal tubule (Pax8Cre system) was developed and phenotyped with respect to water handling. Two weeks after doxycycline treatment, EP4 mRNA expression (RT-qPCR) was reduced by >80% in the medulla of male and female knockout mice (EP4-/-) compared to controls (EP4+/+). With free access to water, there were no detectable differences between genotypes in food intake, bodyweight or plasma biochemistries. Male, but not female, EP4-/- mice had a small, but significantly higher basal urinary output with decreased osmolality, concomitant with lower urinary Na+, K+, Cl-, urea and creatinine concentrations. The urea channel UT-A1 was reduced in the medulla, but otherwise no major differences in the levels of proteins involved in water balance were observed between genotypes. There were no differences between genotypes in their ability to concentrate urine during a 14 h water restriction or after treatment with the vasopressin V2 receptor agonist dDAVP. EP4-/- mice of both sexes excreted an acute water load similarly to control mice. In conclusion, EP4 in the renal tubule has a mild role in renal water handling, but only in male mice. This new model provides a novel tool for assessing the role of EP4 in kidney tubule function in various (patho)physiological conditions independently of developmental abnormalities or systemic effects."

Solution-processable graphene, especially graphene dispersion in water (GDW), has emerged as a promising candidate for cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and large-scale production. However, the energy level alignment between GDW and semiconductors, which is critical for designing efficient device architectures, remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigated the interfacial electronic structures of GDW electrodes with organic semiconductors (C60 and rubrene) using in situ x-ray/ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We also explored the effect of ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O3) treatment on the charge injection barriers. After 5 min of UV-O3 treatment, the work function of GDW increased by ∼0.4 eV due to surface oxidation, shifting the electron and hole injection barriers for C60 from 0.59 and 1.66 eV to 0.84 and 1.41 eV, respectively, and shifting those for rubrene from 1.82 and 0.74 eV to 2.14 and 0.42 eV, respectively. Weak interactions of both organic semiconductors with the GDW were observed, in contrast to metal electrodes. These results provide valuable insights into the design of future high-efficiency devices using GDW."

However, fungi pose significant pathogenic risks due to their substantially higher chlorine resistance compared to bacteria. Existing approaches for evaluating fungal chlorine resistance face challenges, including the absence of standardized protocols, labor-intensive procedures, prolonged experimental durations, and limited real-time detection capabilities. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying fungal chlorine resistance remain inadequately understood. This study provides a comprehensive and systematic comparison of the primary methods used to assess fungal chlorine resistance, including log reduction, concentration-time (CT) values, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The CT value method incorporates disinfectant decay, contact time, and experimental conditions to reflect the dynamics of the disinfection process. In contrast, the log reduction method focuses on endpoint inactivation, while MIC provides a retrospective evaluation. Therefore, the CT method is recommended as the most effective method. This study investigates the underlying mechanisms of fungal chlorine resistance, emphasizing the critical roles played by fungal cell wall components, such as melanin and chitosan, the antioxidant enzyme systems, and the formation of biofilms in conferring enhanced resistance to chlorine exposure. The findings provide a theoretical foundation for the development of standardized methods and more effective strategies for controlling fungal contamination in water treatment process."

      "abstract": "Among the multitude of toxic water pollutants, Pb2+ poses a significant threat to human health. A novel magnetic manganese-based metal-organic framework (Mn-MOF) composite, MFCys, was designed for the selective removal of Pb2+. MFCys was readily synthesized through the postsynthetic modification of magnetic Mn-MOF/Fe3O4 (MF) with l-cysteine (l-Cys), utilizing a prospective Mn-MOF, {[Mn2(tzpa)(OH)(H2O)2]·DMA}n. MFCys demonstrated superior adsorption of Pb2+, reaching equilibrium within 2 h compared to Mn-MOF and MF. The Langmuir model indicated that MFCys underwent chemisorption of Pb2+. Meanwhile, the adsorption process aligned with the pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic model, confirming that Pb2+ was adsorbed by MFCys mainly through monolayer chemisorption. Thermodynamic results revealed that the adsorption of Pb2+ by MFCys was spontaneous and endothermic. Moreover, even in the presence of competing Cd2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Pb2+, MFCys exhibited exceptional selectivity for Pb2+ due to the electrostatic interaction and the electronic coupling effect between MFCys and Pb2+. The magnetic MFCys enabled easy separation from the suspension within 1 min by using an external magnet for recycling. MFCys retained 98.0% of the initial adsorption capacity for Pb2+ after five cycles, demonstrating excellent reusability. Notably, MFCys displayed exceptional adsorption of Pb2+ in simulated lead-acid battery wastewater, retaining 98.3% of its pristine adsorption capacity for Pb2+ even after five cycles. These findings suggest that an easily separated Mn-MOF composite has promising application prospects in Pb2+ wastewater treatment."

However, existing trials have not included stroke survivors' perspectives in intervention development, which are critical to ensure a WBTE program meets the needs of stroke survivors and provides supports to enable engagement in ongoing exercise. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were completed with stroke survivors and caregivers with the aim to have them (1) provide feedback on elements of the intervention resulting from a preceding scoping review and (2) identify barriers, facilitators and other considerations that may impact implementation. Literature on the development of complex health interventions and implementation science informed interview topics. Interviews were analyzed using generic coding and thematic analysis for open-ended and closed-ended questions, respectively. RESULTS: Stroke survivor and caregivers largely confirmed findings from the scoping review regarding intervention characteristics. Four main considerations for implementation were identified in interview analysis: (1) safety, (2) knowledge and beliefs, (3) environment, and (4) individual characteristics. CONCLUSION: It is essential to consider stroke survivor and caregiver perspectives when developing interventions to promote ongoing exercise following formal rehabilitation. The unique needs of each stroke survivor should be evaluated to optimize participation in WBTE."
