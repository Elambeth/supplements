      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was associated with an intense impact on health worldwide. Among the sequelae, it became necessary to clarify respiratory impairment related to lung function and aerobic capacity, as well as the treatment of curative and preventive measures of pulmonary involvement. In this context, this study aimed to compare vital signs, the sensation of dyspnea (Borg scale), lung function, and exercise tolerance before and after the use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) in adults of both sexes after acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: A cross-sectional analytical clinical study was performed with the inclusion of individuals who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 at least three months before data collection. Individuals were evaluated for vital signs (heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation), Borg scale, spirometry, and submaximal exercise protocol of two minutes of the step test before and after receiving NIV in ventilation mode by continuous positive airway pressure of 6 cm H2O for 30 min. Results: A total of 50 participants were enrolled and grouped as a mild (N = 25) or severe (N = 25) clinical phenotype during SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the criteria of the World Health Organization. In our data, the forced vital capacity (p < 0.001), the ratio between the forced expiratory volume in the first one second to the forced vital capacity and the forced vital capacity (p = 0.020), and the two-minute submaximal step exercise protocol (number of steps-p = 0.001) showed a statistical improvement in the severe clinical phenotype group after NIV. In addition, forced expiratory volume in the first one second to the forced vital capacity (p = 0.032) and the two-minute submaximal step exercise protocol (number of steps-p < 0.001) showed a statistical improvement in the mild clinical phenotype group after NIV. No changes were described for vital signs and the Borg scale. Conclusions: This study allowed us to identify that NIV is a tool that promotes better exercise capacity by increasing the number of steps achieved in both clinical phenotype groups and improving lung function observed in the spirometry markers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, complications of preterm birth are the leading cause of under-5-mortality. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a common and life-threatening complication among preterm infants. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a relatively simple and effective intervention that is recommended for RDS treatment. However, appropriate infrastructure and processes are required to ensure that it is used safely, effectively and sustainably. This study describes how CPAP was used in newborn care in Kenya between 2017-2018. Our aim was to identify enablers, barriers and gaps in CPAP use. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out across all newborn baby units in Kenya between 2017-2018, as part of a evaluation of CPAP use in newborn care. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the quantitative data. RESULTS: Twenty-three hospitals across 15 (32%) of the counties in Kenya were providing CPAP in newborn care. The survey was conducted in 19 hospitals, amounting to 83% of all hospitals providing CPAP in newborn care in the country. Sub-county (level 4) and county (level 5) referral had fewer resources (i.e., trained staff, infrastructure and equipment) than the national referral (level 6) and private hospitals. In addition, there was a wide variation in the CPAP devices used and the resources for supporting CPAP use across different hospitals. CONCLUSION: We found access to CPAP for neonates with RDS was inequitable in Kenya. There were also disparities in the availability of resources, personnel, and guidelines to support its implementation. Lack of standardisation of CPAP use in newborn care was especially evident in the public sector. To optimise coverage and standardisation of CPAP use in newborn care in Kenya, our results support ongoing partnerships to strengthen public and private healthcare sectors involving the implementation of strategies to improve infrastructure for newborn care, train and retain staff, and provide additional equipment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP in increasing the thickness of retinal layers. Other aims were to assess retinal and optic nerve damage predictors in OSA and establish predictors of poor response to CPAP treatment in optic nerve damage. METHODS: A prospective cohort study with consecutive inclusion of the first 3 patients who attended for treatment each day. All patients underwent a diagnostic polygraph, and patients with moderate-severe OSA treated with CPAP were recruited. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was performed within 3 days of the patient's inclusion and 12 months after the start of CPAP treatment. RESULTS: Data from 37 patients with OSA were analysed. After 12 months of CPAP treatment, there was a significant improvement in the thickness of the superotemporal Bruch's membrane opening-minimum rim width (BMO-MRW) (316.54 to 318.23 μm, p-value = 0.08). There was a non-significant improvement in the thickness of nasal, inferonasal and superonasal retinal nerve fibre layers. In a multivariate analysis, HB and Type 2 diabetes mellitus have been associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) of retinal and optical nerve damage (OR = 3.58, p = 0.03 and OR = 4.344, p = 0.042, respectively). CONCLUSION: BMO-MRW thickness may assess early damage induced by OSA and the response to CPAP. HB is a predictor of retinal and optic nerve damage in patients with OSA. CPAP treatment has a long-term protective effect on the retina and optic nerve.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a standard treatment for children with moderate to severe respiratory distress; however, ventilators are often unavailable in developing countries. Bubble CPAP (bCPAP) is considered a simple, cost effective and less invasive alternative to CPAP, however, its efficacy has not been assessed for children with pneumonia until recently. This meta-analysis aims to compare the effectiveness of bCPAP with low-flow oxygen for treating severe pneumonia and hypoxemia in children. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CENTRAL were searched to identify eligible randomized controlled trials reported up to March 23, 2024. Outcomes were reported as risk ratios (RRs) or mean difference (MD) and confidence intervals (CIs) using Review Manager software. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Three studies with 2030 patients were included and revealed no significant difference between bCPAP and control in overall mortality [RR (95% CI) 0.46 (0.09, 2.32); P = 0.348], death during hospital stay [0.48 (0.02, 9.09), P = 0.619], composite primary outcome [0.48 (0.12, 1.97), P = 0.301], pneumothorax [1.94 (0.16, 23.11), P = 0.601], leaving hospital against medical advice [0.63 (0.16, 2.39), P = 0.489], and length of hospital stay [MD (95%CI) 0.15 days (- 0.66, 0.96), P = 0.706]. Children on bCPAP had significantly fewer events of severe hypoxemia [RR (95% CI) 0.22 (0.10, 0.49), P < 0.001], and less requirement for mechanical ventilation [RR (95% CI) 0.38 (0.15, 0.99), P = 0.048]. CONCLUSION: bCPAP is not superior to low-flow oxygen for improving survival and reducing hospital stay in children with pneumonia, albeit the need for mechanical ventilation decreases."

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic condition that is growing in prevalence, associated with important comorbidities, and has several different phenotypes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard OSA treatment, but its effectiveness relies on consistent adherence, which can often be difficult to maintain. This narrative review discusses current challenges in the care pathways for CPAP therapy management in OSA, including fragmented care/lack of continuity, inadequate management of comorbidities, suboptimal implementation of digital medicine solutions, and existing reimbursement paradigms. Key tasks to be shared between the appropriate healthcare professionals and providers include technical CPAP follow-up (adherence, effectiveness, alert management), management of comorbidities, and multimodal non-invasive monitoring. What this looks like and who provides the different aspects of care should vary by OSA phenotype, ranging from simple follow-up in primary care (uncomplicated OSA with good CPAP adherence) to multidisciplinary specialist management (high-risk OSA with comorbidities), with regular reassessment to ensure continued alignment with the chosen care plan. In addition to better defining these pathways, how they are reimbursed also needs to be addressed. We suggest that there should be a multidisciplinary approach to symptom reduction and adherence, longitudinal assessment of patient-reported outcomes, and a focus on long-term cardiometabolic health as part of managing CPAP-treated patients with OSA. Facilitated by the appropriate use of digital technologies, these approaches should lead to more personalized care and greater patient engagement, resulting in better long-term adherence and treatment effectiveness. The ultimate goal should be to do better for less."

METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted at the Cardiorespiratory Syndrome Ward of the First People's Hospital of Linping District, Hangzhou, China, and comprised data of patients with blunt pulmonary trauma admitted from December 2019 to February 2023. The patients were divided into three groups based on the ventilation support mode. Group 1 received synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation + positive endexpiratory pressure, Group 2 received continuous positive airway pressure + pressure support ventilation, and Group 3 recieved pressure-controlled ventilation. Clinical curative effect, respiratory mode parameters, and blood gas analysis indicators of the groups were compared before and after the treatment. Data was analysd using SPSS 20. RESULTS: Of the 227 patients, 71(31.3%) were in Group A; 62(87.3%) males and 9(12.7%) females with mean age 69.6±5.9 years. There were 74(32.6%) patients in Group 2; 59(79.7%) males and 15(20.3%) females with mean age 71.2±6.2 years. In Group 3, there were 82(36.1%) patients; 61(74.4%) males and 21(25.6%) females with mean age 69.0±6.0 years (p>0.05). Most patients 146(64.32%) recovered with no significant differences in treatment effect across the groups (p>0.05). Group 2 showed significant differences in respiratory parameters and blood gas indicators compared to the other groups (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: While all the three ventilation strategies had comparable treatment effect, continuous positive airway pressure + pressure support ventilation was associated with the most favourable respiratory parameters and blood gas analysis indicators.",

This study compared moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with controls to evaluate the effects of this sleep disorder on BBB integrity, as well as explore the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on BBB. METHODS: This study included moderate-severe OSA patients, OSA patients being treated with CPAP for at least 12 months (OSA-CPAP), and a control group with no neurological or psychiatric diseases. Participants underwent neurological examination, cognitive assessment (to exclude cognitive impairment) and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) biomarkers analysis [β-amyloid42 (Aβ42), total-tau, phosphorylated tau, ratio between CSF and serum albumin levels (Qalb)]. RESULTS: 38 moderate-severe OSA patients (mean age 65.50 ± 9.16), 12 patients with OSA treated with CPAP (OSA-CPAP, mean age 65.42 ± 6.45) and 25 controls (mean age 65.64 ± 8.10) were included. Moderate-severe OSA patients showed higher Qalb than controls (p = 0.026); also OSA-CPAP patients presented higher Qalb than controls (p = 0.044). Qalb did not differ comparing moderate-severe OSA and OSA-CPAP groups. OSA patients showed lower CSF Aβ42 levels compared to both controls (p < 0.001) and the OSA-CPAP patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirmed CSF Aβ42 alteration and documented BBB dysfunction, as indicated by the higher Qalb, in OSA patients. The metabolic and oxidative damage caused by hypoxia could account for these phenomenona; however, the BBB impairment seems to be not reversible, as OSA-CPAP patients presented the BBB alteration although normal CSF Aβ42 levels. Further studies exploring BBB function and its clinical implication for neurodegeneration in OSA are needed."

Sleep-disordered breathing is common in PWS and is often ignored by clinicians. This paper reports a patient with PWS complicated with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 13-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to ptosis, lethargy, and weight gain. Polysomnography (PSG) showed OSA and severe hypoxemia. Imaging examination showed scoliosis. Laboratory tests suggested that the patient had metabolic dysfunction. Finally, PWS was diagnosed by chromosome karyotype and gene analysis. The patient's obesity and OSA represented contraindications to growth hormone. After continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, the patient's sleep apnea symptoms and height were significantly improved, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) index was significantly decreased, peripheral oxygen saturation was increased, and his height increased by 4 cm. At present, the patient has been treated with growth hormone after exclusion of contraindications. CONCLUSIONS: This case reports a patient with PWS with severe OSA who had improved height after CPAP treatment alone. This patient's diagnosis had been delayed due to differences in medical education and medical level among the treating physicians. Timely diagnosis and treatment can improve the quality of life of children."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic, has greatly altered our daily lifestyle. Although there have been many reports on the association between COVID-19 and sleep disorders, none have examined this association with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy control. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the impact of lifestyle changes on CPAP users during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. METHODS: This study included patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who were treated with CPAP. We used an original lifestyle questionnaire to collect data on their exercise, amount of food, alcohol consumption, sleep time, and subjective stress. We classified the patients into the following four groups: (I) work from home (WFH); (II) WFH and commuting (hybrid working); (III) commuting; and (IV) unemployed. Downloaded data were used to analyze CPAP adherence. When we compared the physical activity and sleep duration, working respondents were categorized into two groups, namely: (I) the home group, which comprised WFH and hybrid working; and (II) the commuting group without telecommuting at home. RESULTS: Overall, 663 patients enrolled in this study, and among them, 506 (76.3%) were workers. Additionally, 364 (71.9%) participants changed their work style from commuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical activity decreased significantly in 60.9% of the participants in the home group (P<0.01). The sleep duration increased significantly in 19% of the participants (P<0.05). No significant difference was found in Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-J) score among the groups classified based on work styles. CPAP use significantly shorter in working respondents who were hybrid or commuting workers (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many lifestyle changes. More than 50% of workers who was CPAP user changed their work style, resulting in decreased physical activity, and commuters tended to have shorter durations and lower rates of CPAP use compared to teleworkers."

Supine sleep may worsen OSA, and in pregnancy, it is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth due to effects on fetomaternal blood flow. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is considered the gold-standard treatment for moderate to severe OSA, although compliance is frequently poor; positional therapy (PT) is generally less effective than CPAP in nonpregnant patients but may be better tolerated and more accessible during pregnancy. There is limited data on whether widespread, early screening for sleep disorders in pregnant women with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing or at high risk of metabolic complications and subsequent early intervention with CPAP or PT attenuates fetomaternal risks. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to assess improved fetomaternal outcomes in a high-risk pregnant population with OSA, using CPAP or PT, initiated by the 16th week of gestation. METHODS: This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label feasibility study in which pregnant women with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≥5 are treated with CPAP (auto-titrating and fixed pressure) or positional therapy from early gestation (by 16 weeks) until delivery. The primary outcome is the feasibility of the study protocol and the development of gestational diabetes mellitus by the 28-week gestation period. Secondary outcomes include the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), maternal weight gain, uterine artery blood flow, glycemic control during pregnancy (in participants who develop gestational diabetes), changes in maternal circulating biomarkers, and neonatal birthweight complications. Polysomnography at 28- to 32-week gestation period, postpartum polysomnography, therapy compliance, and patient acceptability are also assessed. RESULTS: The trial commenced on September 30, 2019. The trial is ongoing as of August 6, 2024. CONCLUSIONS: The trial intends to contribute to the growing evidence base to support the need for the identification and treatment of OSA occurring during pregnancy and to assess the feasibility of the study protocol. This will be the first trial to compare the early initiation of CPAP (auto-titrating and fixed pressure) and positional therapy in pregnant women from early gestation, providing alternative therapies for the treatment of OSA in this important population.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Residual sleepiness can occur in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) despite adequate treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Various wake-promoting agents (WPAs) have been shown to reduce residual sleepiness in CPAP-treated patients with OSA. This systematic review and network meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of WPAs in this setting. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 9 January 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining WPAs for treating sleepiness in patients with OSA. Included were all RCTs that explored the efficacy and/or safety of any approved WPAs (i.e., modafinil, armodafinil, solriamfetol, or pitolisant) in patients with OSA (aged ≥ 18 years) treated with CPAP but who are still sleepy [Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score ≥10]. Studies that were conducted in patients whose comorbidities cause daytime somnolence [i.e., psychiatric conditions (other than depression), other sleep disorders, medical or surgical conditions], open label extension studies, and studies published in a language other than English were excluded. The primary outcomes included ESS, maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), and adverse events. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials 2.0. RESULTS: In total, 14 RCTs studying four WPAs (total N = 2969) including modafinil (six RCTs; 200-400 mg/day), armodafinil (four RCTs; 150-250mg/day), solriamfetol (two RCTs; 37.5-300 mg/day), and pitolisant (two RCTs; 5-40 mg/day) were included. Solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil were efficacious in reducing subjective sleepiness as measured by ESS [mean difference (95% confidence interval) at ≤ 4 weeks: -3.84 (-5.60, -2.07), -2.44 (-3.38, -1.49), and -2.41 (-3.60, -1.21) for solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil, respectively; at > 4 weeks: -4.11 (-6.14, -2.08), -2.88 (-3.85, -1.91), -2.46 (-3.68, -1.24) for solriamfetol, armodafinil, and modafinil, respectively] and clinical global impression of change, as well as the objective MWT [at ≤ 4 weeks: 11.66 min (9.70, 13.61), 3.61 min (2.48, 4.73), and 2.52 min (1.27, 3.76) for solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil, respectively; at > 4 weeks: 10.34 min (4.16, 16.52) for solriamfetol]. Pitolisant showed later improvements in ESS [at > 4 weeks: -2.70 (-3.66, -1.73)], with limited data on MWT. Sensitivity analyses restricted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved solriamfetol dosages (37.5-150 mg/day) still showed higher efficacy, but lower anxiety risk. CONCLUSIONS: Among all WPAs, solriamfetol demonstrated the highest efficacy on ESS and MWT, with the latter being significant. Modafinil demonstrated the best clinician impression, albeit not statistically significant. All four WPAs were associated with a low risk of serious or adverse events.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Night-to-night adherence to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) treatment with either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mandibular advancement splints (MAS) in pregnancy has not been well characterized. The objective of this study was to assess night-to-night adherence patterns from existing CPAP and MAS data in pregnancy. METHODS: Three separate pregnancy cohorts evaluating treatment for SDB in the second and third trimester were used: 1) CPAP in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 2) CPAP in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and 3) mandibular advancement splints (MAS). The first 30 days of objective adherence data obtained from CPAP and MAS devices were used in this descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Data from 37 CPAP users and 15 MAS users was analyzed. For the GDM and HDP cohorts, three patterns of adherence were observed: 1) consistent CPAP users (38%), 2) improved CPAP usage after initial adaptation (16%), and 3) inconsistent CPAP users (46%). For the MAS cohort, the three observed patterns of adherence were: 1) consistent MAS users (47%), 2) initial usage with subsequent decrease in adherence (20%), and 3) inconsistent MAS users (33%). Participant characteristics (demographics, disease severity) were similar between adherence groups, with the exception of longer total sleep time in consistent CPAP users of the GDM cohort and greater gestational age in consistent CPAP users of the HDP cohort. CONCLUSION: Overall, objective night-to-night adherence patterns revealed that almost half of CPAP and MAS users had difficulty adapting to treatment in the first 30 days of treatment. Early usage patterns in pregnancy may provide insight into identifying patients who are at risk for poor adherence and for developing tailored and timely interventions to enhance adherence to therapy.

In the acute setting, the mask covers the nose and mouth with various interface options. National guidelines indicate that NIV use should be targeted for close to continuous use in the first 24 hours.Research has shown that some oro-nasal masks can generate pressures between 6.37 and 12.2 kPa on the nasal bridge when adjusted to minimise mask leak, essential in reducing patient-ventilator asynchrony. Research has also shown that tissue damage and necrosis can occur after just 2 hours of pressure-induced ischaemia at a pressure of 4.6 kPa, demonstrating this patient cohort's high risk of developing a medical device-related pressure injury (MDRPI).Baseline data from October 2021 onwards identified eight nasal bridge pressure ulcers reported via the Trust's incident reporting system. Five were classified as suspected deep tissue injury, and three were classified as category 2. No ulcers were scored at category 3 or worse.This project used the Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) approach to prevent any new nasal bridge pressure ulcer derived from using NIV or CPAP therapy for any patient admitted to our hospital site for 40 days from 1 November 2022. Using four PDSA cycles, there was a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of category 2 MDRPIs caused by NIV mask interfaces for 1466 'NIV days' across 19 calendar months.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To explore the immediate antihypertensive efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) overnight manual pressure titration (OMPT) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) complicated with hypertension, and the influencing factors related to antihypertensive efficacy. Methods: A total of 88 patients diagnosed with OSA complicated with hypertension who were admitted to the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University from September 2022 to October 2023 due to nocturnal sleep snoring and breath-holding were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were treated with CPAP OMPT during polysomnography (PSG). Based on the immediate antihypertensive effect after CPAP OMPT treatment (changes in blood pressure within 15 minutes before and after treatment), patients were divided into the significant decrease group [group A, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased by ≥5 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased by ≥3 mmHg] and the non-decrease group (group N, SBP decreased by <5 mmHg or DBP decreased by <3 mmHg). The demographic characteristics of the two groups was compared, as well as the differences in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), time for pulse oxygen saturation<90% [T (SpO2<90%)], oxygen desaturation index (ODI), lowest SpO2 during sleep (LSpO2), mean SpO2 during sleep (MSpO2). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors associated with the improvement of blood pressure by CPAP OMPT. Results: A total of 88 patients with OSA complicated with hypertension were included, with 77 males and 11 females, and aged (46.5±13.2) years. There were 33 cases in group A and 55 cases in group N. CPAP OMPT had a significant effect on immediate blood pressure reduction in 37.5% of patients with OSA complicated with hypertension; there were no significant differences in age, gender composition, neck circumference, history of diabetes mellitus, history of coronary heart disease, and history of hyperlipidemia between the two groups (all P>0.05). After CPAP OMPT treatment, the change values of LSpO2 and MSpO2 [M (Q1, Q3)] in group A were higher than those in group N [17.0% (9.0%, 22.0%) vs 8.0%(5.0%, 15.0%), 4.0%(1.0%, 7.0%) vs 2.0%(1.0%, 4.0%), both P<0.05]. The change values of AHI, ODI and T (SpO2<90%) in group A were lower than those in group N [(-59.5±26.2) vs (-43.7±25.3) episodes/h, -52.7(-64.1, -31.0) vs -32.0(-54.0, -12.8) episodes/h, -75.8(-148.6, -9.8) vs -12.0(-82.9, -2.6) min, all P<0.05]. The results of multivariate logistic regression model analysis indicated that the change of LSpO2 was positively associated with the improvement of blood pressure by CPAP OMPT, with an OR value (95%CI) of 1.086 (1.010-1.167). Conclusions: CPAP OMPT has a significant immediate antihypertensive effect on 37.5% of patients with OSA complicated with hypertension. The change values in LSpO2 before and after CPAP OMPT treatment is positively associated with blood pressure improvement.",

The study's purpose was to investigate the effect of one-night continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP treatment) on circadian clock genes: BMAL1, CLOCK, CRY1, and PER1 at mRNA and protein levels. The study included 30 OSA patients, who underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) and next a one-night effective CPAP treatment with PSG monitoring (CPAP). The blood was collected in the evening before and the morning after PSG and CPAP. Protein levels and mRNA expression were measured using ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively. The increase in PER1 expression was observed in the morning after compared to the evening before CPAP (p = 0.005); additionally, PER1 protein level decreased in the morning after CPAP compared to the morning after PSG (p = 0.035). In CLOCK protein levels significant changes were observed: an increase in the morning after CPAP compared to the morning after PSG (p = 0.049), an increase in the morning after CPAP compared to the evening before (p = 0.006), and an increase in difference between the morning after and evening before CPAP vs. difference between morning after and evening before PSG (p = 0.012).

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard for managing moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, adherence to CPAP usage remains problematic with many patients either intermittently or permanently discontinuing CPAP use. However, the impact of CPAP therapy discontinuation remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of complete and intermittent CPAP withdrawal on clinical and objective relapse of OSA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized study involved patients with moderate-to-severe OSA who were compliant with CPAP therapy. All subjects underwent a CPAP efficacy assessment (CPAP check), followed by 1 month of closely monitored CPAP usage. Subjects were then randomized into two groups: (1) complete CPAP withdrawal (NO-CPAP); (2) intermittent CPAP use (INT-CPAP) (using the device every other day). Clinical relapse was assessed daily and defined as reemergence of any of the OSA symptoms. Weekly home sleep testing was performed to assess OSA relapse objectively, defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of > 5. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were included, with 12 subjects assigned to NO-CPAP group and 10 to the INT-CPAP group. Both groups exhibited a rapid recurrence of OSA within 1 week of CPAP discontinuation, with significant increases in AHI, oxygen desaturation index, and time spent with O2 saturation < 90% compared to baseline CPAP-check parameters (p < 0.05). In addition, clinical relapse occurred earlier in ⁓70% of the INT-CPAP group (Median 2.9 days) and 33% in the NO-CPAP group (Median, 3.5 days) (p < 0.05). Age and neck circumference were identified as significant predictors of OSA relapse (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Discontinuation of CPAP therapy, whether completely or intermittently, leads to rapid OSA relapse, with age and neck circumference being key predictors of OSA relapse. These findings underscore the impact of CPAP withdrawal and the need for continuous CPAP adherence to effectively manage OSA.

      "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), especially on the incidence of hypertensive disorder in pregnancy (HDP) in women with moderate to severe OSAS. Methods: A total of 180 pregnant women with OSAS who were diagnosed through sleep monitoring during pregnancy due to high-risk factors of OSAS and registered in Peking University People's Hospital from January 2021 to May 2024 were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data were collected from medical records for retrospective analysis. According to whether they received standardized treatment with CPAP, they were divided into the CPAP treatment group (42 cases) and the control group (138 cases). The CPAP treatment group consisted of 9 pregnant women with moderate to severe OSAS, while the control group consisted of 34 pregnant women with moderate to severe OSAS. The maternal and neonatal outcomes, the incidence of HDP, placental weight after delivery and placental weight/neonatal birth weight ratio were compared between the two groups. Results: (1) The average gestational age of pregnant women in the CPAP treatment group was higher than that in the control group [(38.7±1.0) vs (38.0±1.4) weeks], the proportion of infants small for gestational age (SGA) in the CPAP treatment group was lower [0 (0/42) vs 12.3% (17/138)], and the birth weight of infants in the CPAP treatment group was bigger [(3 396±475) vs (3 082±710) g); the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (all P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the CPAP treatment group and the control group in terms of delivery mode, rates of postpartum hemorrhage and preterm birth, umbilical artery blood gas analysis pH<7.1, lactate≥6.0 mmol/L, base excess<-12.0 mmol/L and the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus and HDP (all P>0.05). (2) The placental weight of the CPAP treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control group [(554.0±70.6) vs (615.7±119.1) g], the placental weight/newborn birth weight ratio of the CPAP treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control group (median: 0.17 vs 0.19), and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). (3) The incidence of HDP in pregnant women with moderate to severe OSAS in the CPAP treatment group was lower than that in the control group [1/9 vs 61.8% (21/34)], and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions: CPAP treatment could prolong the gestational age in pregnant women with OSAS, reduce the incidence of SGA, increase the birth weight of infants, and reduce the incidence of HDP in pregnant women with moderate to severe OSAS, and is worth promoting in clinical practice. The improvement of neonatal outcomes by CPAP treatment is closely related to the placenta, which is worthy of further exploration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) have been studied over decades using different study designs. However, clinical findings from different study models on cardiovascular outcomes are sometimes contradictory. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed for randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses, population-based epidemiological studies and OSA cohort studies up to September 2023 investigating the cardiovascular effects of OSA and CPAP in adults with OSA on the following cardiovascular end-points: blood pressure, arterial hypertension, endothelial function and MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischaemic attack or cardiovascular death). The level of evidence for these outcomes was discussed on the basis of different study models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There is high-level evidence of a causal relationship between OSA and arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, as well as on higher MACE incidence among subgroups of patients with untreated OSA. The cardiovascular effects of OSA depend on the severity of OSA, symptoms, phenotype and comorbidities. The blood pressure-lowering effect of CPAP is mainly observed in uncontrolled and treatment-resistant hypertension. The MACE risk reduction in OSA depends on good long-term CPAP adherence. Younger, sleepy patients with more severe OSA, higher hypoxaemic burden and without overt cardiovascular end-organ disease may particularly benefit from CPAP treatment in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction. Randomised controlled trials of CPAP or other effective OSA treatments in primary cardiovascular prevention and in patients at highest risk are lacking."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effectively prevents sleep apnea and reduces blood pressure, many patients do not use CPAP every night. This trial investigates cardiovascular effects after sleeping five nights without CPAP. METHODS: We randomized 100 patients (67 men and 33 women with a mean age 64 ± 9 years) using CPAP treatment for moderate-to-severe sleep apnea to either withdraw treatment for five nights ( n  = 50) or to continue with CPAP ( n  = 50). The primary outcomes were arterial stiffness and 24 h blood pressure. RESULTS: The 24 h SBP increased by a mean of 2.8 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-5.4 mmHg] ( P  = 0.035) and DBP increased by a mean of 1.7 mmHg (95% CI 0.1-3.3 mmHg) ( P  = 0.032) in the group without CPAP compared to the CPAP group. There was a significant effect on blood pressure in women but not in men. In women, SBP increased by 5.1 mmHg (95% CI 1.0-9.5 mmHg) ( P  = 0.017) and DBP by 2.9 mmHg (95% CI 0.4-5.6 mmHg) ( P  = 0.029). Arterial stiffness remained unaffected. Secondary outcomes that worsened in patients without CPAP included apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, hemoglobin levels, and daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSION: Blood pressure is affected after five nights of CPAP interruption, along with a rapid return of sleep apneas, nocturnal hypoxic events, daytime sleepiness and increased hemoglobin levels, but arterial stiffness was not affected. Blood pressure was affected in women only, suggesting a sex-related CPAP effect on blood pressure.",

This study aimed to evaluate the duration of nCPAP treatment and length of stay (LOS) in newborn infants with respiratory distress receiving bedside nCPAP compared to nCPAP in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised newborn infants born at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation requiring nCPAP treatment within the first 2 h of life due to respiratory distress. Data were collected from October 2011 to October 2020 at Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark. RESULTS: Bedside nCPAP was administered to 225 newborn infants, while 185 newborn infants received nCPAP at the NICU. Newborn infants receiving bedside nCPAP had a shorter duration of CPAP treatment (4.4 vs. 7.3 h, p < 0.001) and LOS (7.2 vs. 20.2 h, p < 0.001). Transfer to the NICU was avoided in 72% of newborn infants receiving bedside nCPAP. CONCLUSION: Bedside nCPAP reduces the duration of CPAP treatment and LOS compared to nCPAP in the NICU. About 72% of newborn infants receiving bedside nCPAP avoided transfer to the NICU and avoided separation from their mothers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems globally, highlighting the need for effective respiratory support strategies. Helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has emerged as a potential noninvasive ventilation (NIV) method for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus from December 1, 2019, to June 1, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing helmet CPAP therapy with standard oxygen therapy or other forms of NIV in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were included. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Three RCTs involving 580 patients were included in this analysis. There was no significant differences (P > 0.05) in mortality at 28 d (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.84-1.71), 60-90 d (1.02, 95% CI, 0.75-1.37), or 180 d (0.98, 95% CI, 0.76-1.25) between the helmet CPAP group and the control group as well as similar intubation rates (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73-1.10) and times to intubation. However, helmet CPAP was associated with significantly shorter ICU stays and hospital stays. The adverse event rates were similar between the groups. Patient comfort, as measured by the EQ-VAS, was significantly better with the CPAP helmet. CONCLUSION: The use of helmet CPAP for the treatment of respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 showed comparable intubation rates and shorter ICU and hospital stays without increasing mortality or adverse events. Key messages What is already known about this topic?  Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) methods, such as helmet CPAP, treat patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The effectiveness of helmet CPAP for COVID-19 patients is unknown. What this study adds?  This study shows that helmet CPAP has similar intubation and mortality rates to standard treatments in COVID-19 acute respiratory failure patients. It also highlights how helmet CPAP reduces ICU and hospital stays and improves patient comfort. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy?  The findings of this study could lead to future research into helmet CPAP approaches for COVID-19 and other respiratory failure patients. They could also influence clinical practice and healthcare policy by emphasizing helmet CPAP as a preferable noninvasive ventilation technique for similar patient populations."

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, its effectiveness is limited by poor long-term compliance. Few recent studies have investigated the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in treating OSA; however, its role remains uncertain. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of HFNC, compared with CPAP, in the treatment of patients with OSA. METHODS: This prospective open-label randomized crossover trial was conducted on treatment-naïve, newly-diagnosed patients with OSA. Participants underwent a CPAP and a HFNC titration studies in one-of-two crossover sequences. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines for CPAP titration were followed for titration of both: CPAP and HFNC. The initial flow rate of HFNC was set at 10 L/min, and the flow rate was increased by 10 L/min, up to a maximum of 60 L/min, to eliminate all respiratory events. RESULTS: Sixty-eight participants completed the study. Compared to the diagnostic PSG, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) decreased by a median of 52% with HFNC therapy [18-77, p value < 0.001]. Clinically acceptable titration was observed in 48% of patients receiving HFNC therapy, whereas 53% experienced a ≥50% reduction in the AHI. The efficacy of HFNC decreased as OSA severity increased. However, CPAP therapy provided superior control of OSA, with a lower AHI (5.8 vs. 16.6, p values < 0.001). Sleep architecture significantly improved with CPAP; however, declined with HFNC. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC serves as a viable option for patients intolerant to CPAP, although careful patient selection is essential."

BACKGROUND: The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on blood pressure (BP) in normotensive subjects, particularly among those with a dipping BP pattern, remain uncertain, raising questions about its indication for this group of patients. We assessed the impact of CPAP on BP in normotensive subjects with a dipping BP pattern and severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). METHODS: Randomised, parallel, prospective, controlled trial. Inclusion criteria were an apnoea-hypopnea index ≥30 events/hour, mean 24-hour BP <130/80 mmHg, and daytime-to-nighttime BP reduction ≥10%. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either CPAP treatment or usual care for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) parameters from baseline to the three-month follow-up. RESULTS: The 60 patients who completed the follow-up had a mean age of 52.2 years (sd 10.8), and 40 of them (66.7%) were male. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant changes with CPAP, whereas the usual care group experienced increases in ABPM parameters. This resulted in a mean difference of -3.4 mmHg (95% CI: -6.124 to -0.676; p=0.015) in nighttime diastolic BP between the groups. The per-protocol analysis indicated significant differences between the CPAP and usual care groups for all primary endpoints, except for daytime systolic BP. For nighttime systolic BP, the difference was -6.052 mmHg (95% CI: -10.895 to -1.208; p=0.016). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a protective effect of CPAP, highlighting the importance of CPAP prescription for this population to control potential increases in blood pressure and possibly prevent the onset of hypertension."

The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive performance among middle-aged patients with OSA and normal cognition remain unclear. Objectives: To investigate the effects of CPAP therapy over 12 months on neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive performance. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized clinical trial, we randomly assigned 148 participants with normal cognition and an apnea-hypopnea index ⩾15/h into two groups: patients receiving CPAP with best supportive care (BSC); and patients receiving BSC alone. The primary endpoint was Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score at 6 months after enrollment. The secondary endpoints were intranetwork functional connectivity (FC) of default mode network (DMN) and cortical thickness assessed by functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging, other neuroimaging biomarkers, and neurobehavioral tests. Measurements and Main Results: Between 2017 and 2021, 148 patients were recruited from five hospitals. Linear mixed models showed that there was no significant difference in MoCA scores at 6 months between the CPAP and BSC groups (difference, -0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.72 to 0.65; P = 0.91). However, there were significant differences in the FC of DMN (difference, -13.73; 95% CI, -23.40 to -4.06; P = 0.01) and cortical thickness (difference, -0.06 mm; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01 mm; P = 0.02) between CPAP and BSC groups at 6 months after treatment. No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions: CPAP improved cortical thickness and FC of DMN, suggesting that patients with OSA may recover from brain atrophic processes after CPAP treatment. However, no improvement in MoCA was found. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02886156).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent, yet under-diagnosed sleep disorder and has a strong association with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Vascular abnormalities, nocturnal glucose dysregulation, impaired blood flow, and hypoxia during OSA induce oxidative stress and promote the inflammatory pathways which increase the VEGF factor levels, leading to the progression of DR. AIMS: To date, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective, gold-standard treatment for patients with moderate to severe OSA. However, the implications of CPAP for the treatment of DR due to OSA is still a topic of ongoing debate. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that the administration of CPAP therapy led to a reduction in retinal exudates and optical coherence tomography indices for retinal edema and also exhibited improvement in glycemic control, sleepiness, and overall health-related quality of life. Nevertheless, there are limited studies present that have evaluated the impact of CPAP therapy on DR in patients with OSA and well-designed studies are needed to confirm CPAP's therapeutic effect on DR despite these findings. Moreover, concerns regarding its long-term safety, adherence challenges, and inconsistent study designs limit definitive conclusions about CPAP's efficacy in managing DR. This indicates the need for future studies to advocate for enhanced CPAP adherence strategies, refined diagnostic criteria for OSA, and large-scale clinical trials to explore CPAP's therapeutic role in DR. Addressing these challenges could revolutionize clinical practices, optimize patient outcomes, and establish CPAP as a cornerstone in the integrated management of OSA and DR."

Its effect on lung growth after discharge is unknown. Objectives: To assess whether 2 weeks of eCPAP in stable preterm infants is associated with increased alveolar volume (Va) at 6 months corrected age. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Oregon Health & Science University. Outpatient assessors were unaware of treatment assignment. One hundred infants were randomized to eCPAP versus CPAP discontinuation (dCPAP) to room air. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was Va by the single breath hold technique at 6 months corrected age. Secondary outcomes included DlCO and forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FRC was measured in the NICU. Infants randomized to eCPAP (n = 54) versus dCPAP (n = 46) had the following measurements shown as adjusted mean (SE): Va (500.2 [24.9] vs. 418.1 [23.4] ml; adjusted mean difference, 82.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.3-155.9]; P = 0.033); DlCO (3.4 [0.2] vs. 2.8 [0.1] ml/min/mm Hg; adjusted mean difference, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.1-1.1]; P = 0.018); measurement of FEF at 50% of the expired volume (500.6 [18.2] vs. 437.9 [17.9] ml/s; adjusted mean difference, 62.7 [95% CI, 4.5-121.0]; P = 0.039); FEF between 25% and 75% of expired volume (452.0 [17.4] vs. 394.4 [17.4] ml/s; adjusted mean difference, 57.5 [95% CI, 1.3-113.8]; P = 0.046). Conclusions: Infants randomized to eCPAP versus dCPAP had significantly increased Va at 6 months corrected age. DlCO and FEFs were also increased.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) is the gold standard for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). This therapy eliminates daytime sleepiness and prevents cardiovascular complications of OSAS. Given that CPAP is a chronic therapy and that in most cases it must be used for life, good adherence to treatment is essential for the patient to feel its benefits. Psychological factors play an important role in the compliance of OSAS patients with CPAP therapy. Self-esteem (SE) can be defined as a person's positive or negative attitude toward the self in totality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational, non-randomized study on an essay of 380 observations with 95 patients. After the evaluation period, based on the average time of CPAP used, the patients were divided into two groups: a first group consisting of 50 patients who were considered adherent to the instituted therapy and a second group comprising 45 patients who were considered non-adherent to the instituted therapy. The aim of this article is to assess the role of self-esteem in the adherence of patients with OSAS to CPAP therapy. Determinants of self-esteem at the beginning of treatment (To) were evaluated. The secondary objectives of the study consisted of investigating the existence of other predictors for the evolution of OSA such as self-esteem and clinical/demographic/paraclinical parameters. RESULTS: In the present study, the adherence of patients with OSAS to CPAP therapy was 52.63%. The self-esteem score was higher in adherent patients than non-adherent ones. The main factors associated with increased self-esteem levels included good adherence to therapy, education, patient income, absence of alcohol and tobacco consumption, absence of nocturnal symptoms, use of Auto-CPAP, use of nasal mask, absence of other pulmonary pathology, absence of psychological type D. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological factors play an important role in the compliance of OSAS patients with CPAP therapy. Along with other factors, self-esteem may be one of the predictive factors for patients' adherence to CPAP therapy."

      "abstract": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is commonly prescribed for obstructive sleep apnea. However, improper cleaning and maintenance of CPAP equipment can create an environment that encourages bacterial colonization, leading to opportunistic respiratory infections in patients, especially in immunocompromised patients with concomitant comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We describe the case of a 57-year-old male patient with a history of chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, COPD, and obstructive sleep apnea who presented to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea, productive cough, and respiratory distress. Imaging revealed pneumonia and a respiratory pathogen panel identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa along with Moraxella and Proteus species. The patient admitted to poor CPAP maintenance and noted green-colored growth on his mask, consistent with Pseudomonas colonization. His symptoms improved with tailored antibiotic therapy. CPAP equipment requires routine cleaning to prevent bacterial growth. P. aeruginosa, a waterborne pathogen that thrives in humid environments, can colonize improperly maintained equipment, leading to severe respiratory infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. This case highlights the need for patient education on CPAP hygiene to prevent infectious complications. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between CPAP use, water quality, and infection risk, thereby informing evidence-based guidelines for both clinicians and patients."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is typically treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Some patients experience residual excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) under CPAP. Pitolisant demonstrated effectiveness in reducing EDS. An individual patient meta-analysis was conducted assessing the efficacy and safety of pitolisant 20 mg and 40 mg versus placebo to treat EDS in patients with OSA using CPAP. METHODS: A study-patient, hierarchical, random-effects model was used. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Oxford Sleep Resistance test (OSLER) were co-primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints included EDS-Z scores, fatigue, clinical global impression, and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: The searches identified three randomized controlled trials. Individual patient data were derived from 423 patients (placebo: n = 120, pitolisant 20 mg: n = 183, pitolisant 40 mg: n = 120). Treatment effects on ESS were -3.20 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 4.37, -2.00; P < 0.001) and -3.57 (95 % CI: 4.87, -2.80); P < 0.001) for the 20 mg and 40 mg doses, with corresponding standardized mean differences (SMD) of -0.71 (95 % CI: 0.45, -0.97) and -0.79 (95 % CI: 0.51, -1.08). Treatment effects in minutes for OSLER were 1.24 (95 % CI: 0.60, 1.10, SMD = 0.61; P = 0.001) and 1.21 (95 % CI: 0.06, 1.38, SMD = 0.51; P = 0.006). Pitolisant 40 mg was superior to the 20-mg dose for older age (≥50 years) and higher baseline apnea-hypopnea index values (≥15). No significant differences were observed for safety outcomes. CONCLUSION: Pitolisant 20 mg and 40 mg were significantly therapeutically superior to placebo in treating residual EDS in patients with OSA who received CPAP on the outcomes for ESS, OSLER, and QoL.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). OSA is highly prevalent among patients with CKD, suggesting a bidirectional link between the two conditions. Recent studies reported that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may benefit renal function in OSA patients; however, uncertainties regarding their effects persist. Therefore, we examined the effects of CPAP treatment on renal function in adults with OSA. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant studies from their inception until January 2024. Pooled estimates for all outcomes were calculated using a random-effects model. Primary outcome measures were the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven non-RCTs (NRCTs) (n = 2,660) were included. Compared with the control group, the CPAP group exhibited a significantly minimal alleviation in eGFR decline in NRCT (mean difference [MD] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80 to 3.11, p < 0.001), but not in RCT (MD = 1.42, 95% CI = - 0.99 to 3.82, p = 0.25). No significant associations were found between CPAP therapy and UACR (MD = - 0.05, 95% CI = - 0.41 to 0.30, p = 0.77). CONCLUSION: Current research provides a low to moderate certainty of evidence, suggesting that CPAP therapy has little to no effect on alleviating the decline in renal function. However, further RCTs with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods are required.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) stands as an autonomous risk factor for a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF), which is closely associated with heightened morbidity and mortality rates. The intricate pathophysiological pathways linking OSA to AF encompass chronic intermittent hypoxia, disruptions in the autonomic nervous system, inflammatory responses, and alterations in ion channel function. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy emerges as the frontline treatment for moderate to severe OSA, effectively alleviating symptomatic manifestations and potentially mitigating cardiovascular risks. However, the influence of CPAP on AF among OSA patients remains a subject of debate. Some investigations underscore its beneficial effects, including the reversal of atrial remodeling, enhanced atrial conduction, decreased AF incidence, and improved outcomes post-AF ablation in CPAP-treated individuals. Conversely, other studies reveal neutral or insignificant impacts. This review delves into the repercussions of CPAP therapy on AF in OSA patients, exploring potential explanations for the discrepancies observed across existing research endeavors. By consolidating current evidence and pinpointing areas ripe for further inquiry, this review aspires to inform clinical decision-making regarding the management of OSA-related AF."

It also sought to assess the influence of demographic variables and comorbidities on CPAP adherence. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted at the University Sleep Disorders Center at King Saud University Medical City. The study included 67 OSA patients who exclusively used CPAP for treatment across three distinct intervals: prelockdown, during lockdown, and postlockdown. Adherence to CPAP therapy was objectively measured using \"mask-on on-time monitoring\" data from the CPAP machines. RESULTS: The study found a significant decrease in the number of days with CPAP usage during the lockdown period, which persisted postlockdown. Approximately half of the patients adhered to CPAP treatment throughout the three study intervals. The decrease in CPAP usage days during lockdown was particularly noticeable among patients younger than 50 and older than 65 years of age. The presence of comorbidities, body mass index, and sex did not significantly influence CPAP treatment adherence. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown significantly impacted CPAP treatment adherence among OSA patients, with a decrease in adherence persisting postlockdown. This highlights the need for interventions to support CPAP adherence during challenging times such as a pandemic. Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the pandemic on CPAP therapy adherence."

While Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is widely utilized, assessing treatment effectiveness remains complex. This study aimed to establish reference values for mean disease alleviation (MDA) in a large CPAP-treated cohort. METHODS: Data from the Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study (APPLES) were analyzed. A total of 352 participants underwent 6 months of CPAP therapy, with adherence and efficacy monitored objectively. MDA, calculated as the product of treatment efficacy and percentage adherence, was assessed. Age and sex differences in MDA and its association with sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores >10) were evaluated using logistic regression and linear regression models. RESULTS: The mean MDA in the 352 participants at 6 months was 61.1% (±34.2%), with a significant positive correlation between MDA and adherence (R=0.81, P<0.001). Older participants demonstrated higher adherence and MDA compared to younger participants (58.2% ± 27.8% vs. 51.1% ± 27.4%, P=0.047). Despite higher efficacy, females demonstrated lower adherence, yielding comparable MDA levels to males. Participants achieving MDA ≥40% had significantly lower odds of sleepiness (OR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.23-0.70, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MDA serves as a valuable metric for evaluating OSA therapy outcomes, integrating both adherence and treatment efficacy. MDA ≥40% was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in sleepiness. Embracing MDA as a benchmark for OSA therapy evaluation holds promise for optimizing personalized and effective OSA management and improving patient outcomes. Future research should focus on optimizing MDA and exploring its impact on long-term outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Titration of oxygen therapy to target safe oxygen saturation (SpO2) values is a vital part of care for preterm infants, but is difficult to achieve, particularly in settings in which oxygen, monitoring technology, and human resources are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of automated titration of oxygen therapy partnered with a low-cost continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device versus manual oxygen control in preterm infants requiring CPAP in a high-mortality, low-resource setting. METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, crossover trial, preterm infants with a gestational age younger than 34 weeks (or a birthweight <2 kg if gestation was unknown) who were aged 12 h or older and required CPAP and oxygen were recruited at two hospitals in southwest Nigeria. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two intervention sequences (ie, to commence the study on automated oxygen control or manual oxygen control) with block randomisation (blocks of 4 and 6) and stratification by health facility. The study statistician was masked to treatment group assignment, but the participants' parents or caregivers and clinical staff were not. Participants received automated or manual oxygen control for two 24-h periods in random sequence. Automated oxygen titration was done with a control algorithm with proven efficacy in high-resource settings. During periods of manual control, oxygen therapy was adjusted by clinicians. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean difference in the proportion of time participants spent in the SpO2 target range (ie, SpO2 91-95% when receiving oxygen or SpO2 91-100% when not receiving oxygen) between automated and manual oxygen control, analysed by intention to treat with weighted repeated measures mixed model linear regression. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05508308, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2022, and Sept 11, 2023, 72 infants were screened, and 49 (22 female, 27 male; median gestation 29 weeks [IQR 28-31]; median birthweight 1·2 kg [1·1-1·5]) were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned. A total of 80 study periods for 46 infants contributed data to the analysis of the primary outcome as three (6%) of the 49 participants had no oxygenation data from either study period. The mean proportion of time spent in the SpO2 target range was higher during automated control periods than during periods of manual control (adjusted mean 88·1% [95% CI 84·0-92·2] vs 30·1% [20·9-39·3]; adjusted mean difference 58·0% [95% CI 48·0-67·9]; p<0·0001). There were no device-related adverse patient outcomes and short-term safety outcomes favoured automated control. INTERPRETATION: Automated titration of oxygen partnered with a low-cost CPAP device improved time spent in the safe SpO2 range compared with manual control. There is high potential for this technology to mitigate the risk of oxygen-mediated complications in preterm infants in low-resource settings.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of complete or partial upper airway collapse during sleep. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related movement disorder characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs, especially during inactivity and evenings. Both OSA and RLS are common with significant overlap: RLS is present in up to 36% of those with OSA. Treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy may influence RLS outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the impact of CPAP therapy on RLS symptoms and RLS medication usage in individuals with both OSA and RLS. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to December 7, 2024. The outcomes of interest were the improvement in RLS symptom severity, as measured by standardized scales such as the International RLS Study Group RLS Severity Scale (IRLS), and changes in the usage of RLS medications. The review included clinical trials and observational studies. Inclusion criteria were: studies with a control group or comparison period before CPAP usage, adult participants diagnosed with OSA and RLS, measurements of RLS severity using standardized scales such as the IRLS, and reports on medication usage before and after CPAP therapy. Data extraction included study characteristics, participant demographics, exposure and outcome measurements, and adjusted effect estimates. Exclusion criteria included non-primary research articles such as reviews, editorials, commentaries, letters, studies without standardized assessments of RLS symptoms, and non-English articles. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Scale (NOS), and the risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBINS-I tool. The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024550240). RESULTS: The search identified 2,046 articles, with 291 undergoing full-text review, and three studies (3 observational, 0 RCTs) meeting the inclusion criteria, which included 479 patients. CPAP therapy was associated with improvements in RLS symptoms and a reduction in medication usage among patients with coexistent RLS and OSA. The magnitude of these effects varied, with some studies reporting significant improvements while others showed probable changes. The variability in results can be attributed to differences in study designs, sample sizes, and adjustments for confounding factors. These factors highlight the need for more rigorous research to evaluate the benefits of CPAP therapy in patients with coexistent RLS and OSA. CONCLUSION: CPAP therapy appears beneficial for improving RLS symptoms and reducing medication usage in patients with coexistent OSA and RLS. However, further research with standardized diagnostic and treatment criteria, larger sample sizes, and robust adjustment for confounding factors is necessary to confirm these findings and better understand the underlying mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Previous studies evaluating the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on blood pressure (BP) among patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) showed variable results. Moreover, several studies recruited patients with normal or controlled BP, and compliance with antihypertensive drug treatment was not monitored. In addition, very few studies investigated central BP in this scenario. Objectives: To evaluate whether OSA treatment is able to reduce central and peripheral BP in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) despite well-documented use of antihypertensive treatment. Methods: MORPHEOS is a multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of CPAP or placebo (nasal dilator strips [NDSs]) for 6 months in patients with moderate to severe OSA and uncontrolled HTN on office BP, ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), and central BP (coprimary endpoints). Uncontrolled HTN was defined by at least one abnormal parameter on ABPM after 1 month and ⩾80% adherence to medication based on a pill count. Pill counts, adherence to CPAP or NDS, and office BP were determined once per week in the first month and monthly thereafter. Results: A total of 123 patients completed the study (NDS, n = 64; CPAP, n = 59). The two groups were similar at baseline. Adherence to NDS (⩾80%) and CPAP (⩾4 hours per night) were 98.3% and 81.7%, respectively. Compared with NDSs, office systolic BP (Δ = -10 ± 16 mm Hg; P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (Δ = -7 ± 12 mm Hg; P = 0.001) were reduced significantly in the CPAP group. Despite the BP-lowering effect of CPAP not reaching statistical significance for the ABPM parameters, the rate of 24-hour ABPM control (<130/80 mm Hg) was higher in the CPAP group than in the NDS group (40.7% vs. 20%; P = 0.024). Central diastolic BP was reduced significantly (Δ = -6 ± 9 mm Hg; adjusted P = 0.029). Conclusions: CPAP improves the rates of BP control in patients with OSA and uncontrolled HTN with regular use of medications. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02270658)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in veterans with mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Untreated OSA reduces the effectiveness of the treatment of PTSD. Treatment of OSA has been shown to reduce daytime sleepiness and symptoms of PTSD and depression. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective treatment for OSA. A large number of veterans cannot tolerate CPAP therapy due to anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Positive airway pressure (PAP) NAP, a daytime sleep study for patients with anxiety about starting CPAP and exposure-based cognitive behavioural interventions are the mainstay for the management of CPAP intolerance. However, these options are not readily available to veterans in rural areas, who constitute about 40% of veterans registered in the South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS). METHODS: After getting local IRB exemption, we surveyed thirty (30) veterans in the outpatient clinic setting who could not tolerate CPAP therapy to evaluate the need for a tool to improve CPAP adherence. We reviewed the literature and conducted focused group meetings with local and national experts. We also convened consumer groups and stakeholder meetings, including primary care, sleep medicine, and mental health providers. RESULTS: After a comprehensive evaluation process, we compiled a concise self-help guide combining principles of cognitive behavioural therapy using a behavioural hierarchy approach towards CPAP desensitization. This guide can be used by veterans independently at their homes to improve CPAP use. A printer-friendly version is available for download on the South Central Mental Illness, Research, Education and Clinical Center (SC MIRECC) and the South Texas Veterans Healthcare System (STVHCS) website. The guide will be provided to veterans during the initial CPAP setup and available in clinic waiting rooms throughout the system. CONCLUSION: Our guide will serve as an effective self-help tool to improve CPAP adherence. It may result in the improvement of various medical and psychiatric conditions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (bCPAP) has become a crucial intervention in neonatal care, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to advanced respiratory support is scarce. While bCPAP offers a cost-effective solution for neonatal respiratory distress, conducting clinical trials in these settings presents significant ethical challenges. Issues of justice, beneficence, and autonomy arise due to disparities in healthcare infrastructure, complexities surrounding informed consent, and the potential exploitation of vulnerable populations. METHODS: In this study, I examine the ethical principles essential to the design and implementation of bCPAP trials, focusing on justice, beneficence, and autonomy within the constraints of resource-limited settings. A normative analysis was conducted, drawing on key ethical frameworks to establish guiding principles for conducting ethically sound bCPAP trials. RESULTS: Applying frameworks such as Rawls' theory of distributive justice and Sen's capability approach, I argue for prioritizing neonatal populations in low-resource settings while addressing the potential for exploitation. Autonomy underscores the need for informed consent processes that are culturally appropriate and accessible, empowering caregivers in decision-making. Beneficence and non-maleficence are evaluated through both utilitarian and deontological perspectives, balancing the potential benefits of innovation against the risks to participants. Structural inequities that complicate neonatal care and research are also critically examined. CONCLUSION: I advocate for the integration of ethical safeguards, including community-centered consent processes, rigorous trial protocols, and international collaboration to mitigate systemic inequities. By incorporating these ethical considerations, bCPAP research can better serve the interests of neonates and their families while ensuring their safety and dignity are upheld.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CPAP has been shown to be particularly beneficial in the management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema by reducing both preload and afterload, thus decreasing the work of breathing and improving oxygenation. METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study, conducted in the period from 2022 to 2024, assessing the effectiveness and safety of prehospital CPAP therapy use in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, administered alongside standard care. RESULTS: In this study, 50 patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema were treated by physician-led emergency teams in the Canton of Sarajevo. CPAP significantly improved clinical parameters across all time points. Systolic blood pressure decreased from 151.0 ± 41.0 mmHg at initial contact to 138.4 ± 32.0 mmHg before transportation and further to 130.2 ± 28.5 mmHg upon hospital admission (p < 0.001). Diastolic pressure dropped from 85.6 ± 17.2 mmHg to 81.1 ± 15.2 mmHg before transportation (p = 0.018), with a slight further decrease to 80.2 ± 13.9 mmHg (p = 0.083). Heart rate fell from 114 ± 26.4 bpm to 111.3 ± 24.9 bpm before transportation (p = 0.003) and finally to 99.5 ± 18.2 bpm before hospital admission (p < 0.001). Respiratory rate decreased from 31.0 ± 10.2 to 28.0 ± 10.5 breaths/min (p = 0.002) and further to 22.6 ± 7.3 breaths/min (p < 0.001). End-tidal CO2 levels increased from 28.0 mmHg (23.5; 33.5) to 30.0 mmHg before transportation (p < 0.001), and to 35.0 mmHg (32.0; 37.5) before hospital admission (p < 0.001). Oxygen saturation improved from 79.0% (72.0; 81.0) to 84.0% before transportation (p < 0.001) and reached 94.0% (91.0; 98.2) before hospital admission (p < 0.001). VAS scores for dyspnea significantly dropped from 8.0 (6.0; 8.2) at initial contact to 6.0 (4.0; 8.0) before transportation (p < 0.001) and further to 4.0 (3.0; 5.0) before hospital admission (p < 0.001), indicating substantial symptom relief. ECG findings remained stable throughout the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital CPAP therapy significantly improved clinical outcomes in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, including reductions in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and enhanced oxygenation and symptom relief. These findings support its broader use in emergency care, even during short transport times.",

      "abstract": "Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a respiratory disorder characterized by cessation of breathing during sleep, resulting in daytime somnolence and various comorbidities. SAHS encompasses obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by upper airway obstruction, and central sleep apnea (CSA), resulting from lack of brainstem signaling for respiration. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the gold standard treatment for SAHS, reducing apnea and hypopnea episodes by providing continuous airflow. CPAP enhances sleep quality and improves overall health by reducing the risk of comorbidities such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and stroke. CPAP nonadherence leads to health deterioration and occurs due to mask discomfort, unsupportive partners, upper respiratory dryness, and claustrophobia. Technological advancements such as auto-titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) systems, smart fit mask interface systems, and telemonitoring devices offer patients greater comfort and enhance adherence. Future research should focus on new technological developments, such as artificial intelligence, which may detect treatment failure and alert providers to intervene accordingly.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subglottic stenosis is a significant clinical challenge in pediatric anesthesia, often necessitating interventions that can lead to various postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of prophylactic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) application on recovery time and airway complications in pediatric patients with subglottic stenosis undergoing balloon dilatation. METHODS: A prospective, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomized controlled study was conducted at Health Sciences University Ümraniye Training and Research Hospital on pediatric patients with subglottic stenosis, aged from 0 to 12 years and who underwent elective balloon dilatation under general anesthesia. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the CPAP or non-CPAP group. The primary outcome was the duration of recovery time. Secondary outcomes included bronchospasm, the number of desaturation episodes, intubation, tracheostomy, and the need for intensive care. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial, 81 of which received the allocated treatment and were analyzed (non-CPAP n = 41, CPAP n = 40). Compared to controls, the proportions of bronchospasm, tracheal secretion, need for intensive care, and tracheostomy were consistently lower in the CPAP group, whereas the requirement of intubation was higher. Further, the mean recovery time was significantly shorter in the CPAP group compared to the non-CPAP group (mean difference - 3.3 min, 95%CI - 5.16 to - 1.44, p = 0.0007). Despite lacking statistical significance, the CPAP group had reduced odds of developing bronchospasm, tracheal secretion, need for intensive care, and tracheostomy, but higher odds of requiring intubation when compared to the controls. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic CPAP application following therapeutic balloon dilatation in pediatric patients who have developed subglottic stenosis due to acquired or congenital causes appears to effectively shorten recovery time and may have a role in decreasing postoperative pulmonary complications; however, more research is recommended to further confirm these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this clinical trial was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov with registration ID NCT06183515 on 30 November 2023."

Abstract search and screening were independently performed followed by eligible full-text versions reviewed. Then disagreements were discussed in a group. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis considered 15 studies with 495 participants. The pooled mean intraocular pressure after CPAP therapy shows no significant difference compared to the baseline (MD, 0.58 mmHg; 95% CI, -0.33 to 1.19). Subgroup analysis shows significantly higher intraocular pressure after in-lab PAP titration and after long-term CPAP used (MD, 4.28 mmHg; 95% CI, 0.91 to 7.66; MD, 0.45 mmHg; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.83; respectively). Ocular perfusion pressure was also significantly decreased after CPAP therapy. (MD, -2.15 mmHg; 95% CI, -3.50 to -0.80). The pooled data showed no significant difference in RNFL thickness and macular layer thickness. CONCLUSIONS: After long-term treatments CPAP therapy, there is a significant increase in intraocular pressure in patients with OSA and a decrease in ocular perfusion pressure but did not show a significant difference in other ophthalmologic parameters. For this reason, CPAP usage in glaucoma patients necessitates to be done cautiously.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) is the most common complication of preterm neonates. It remains one of the major public health concerns that contribute to neonatal mortality and morbidity, especially in Africa, where 80% of neonatal mortality is estimated to be caused by preterm complications. Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) ventilation is the preferred mode of RDS treatment. However, NCPAP is not easily accessible to every preterm neonate in low- and middle-income countries, and this is the case in Kenya. OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of preterm neonates admitted to the newborn unit (NBU) at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), a tertiary referral hospital in Kenya, with a missed opportunity for NCPAP and to determine the barriers and facilitators of NCPAP utilisation. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study that employed interactive explanatory concurrent mixed methods. The quantitative approach determined the proportion of missed opportunities for NCPAP in preterm neonates admitted to the KNH newborn unit, while the qualitative approach explored the barriers and facilitators of NCPAP utilisation. PARTICIPANTS: Preterm neonates of gestation less than 37 weeks in the first 48 hours of life who met the criteria for NCPAP. The key informants were mainly different staff cadres from the newborn unit, a procurement officer and a biomedical engineer. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of preterm infants admitted to the newborn unit with a missed opportunity for NCPAP, and the barriers and facilitators of NCPAP utilisation. RESULTS: 167 preterm neonates were reviewed from July to November 2021 and analysed of whom 33.5% (95% CI 26.8% to 41.0%) missed the opportunity to receive NCPAP. 20 key informants were interviewed from September to October 2021. Facilitators of NCPAP use reported were (1) training of health workers, (2) availability of NCPAP machines, (3) KNH being a national and tertiary referral hospital able to receive neonates referred with RDS, (4) global evidence that NCPAP use is beneficial and (5) technology development. Barriers to NCPAP use were mainly (1) inadequate number of NCPAP machines, (2) inadequate training and mentorship, (3) inadequate and inappropriate size of NCPAP consumables, (4) staff shortage, (5) long servicing turnaround time, (6) long cleaning turnaround time, (7) infrastructure challenges and (8) insufficient utilities. CONCLUSION: The missed opportunity for NCPAP in preterm neonates in Kenya is high. Barriers to NCPAP are related to medical products and technologies, health workforce-related challenges and service delivery. We recommend the provision of more NCPAP machines including supporting infrastructure and appropriate consumables, human resource support, frequent training and mentorship on NCPAP use.",

However, the pathophysiological mechanism by which CPAP treatment improves the prognosis of patients with CHD and OSA remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether CPAP can improve arterial stiffness and inflammatory factor levels in CHD patients with OSA, and to further improve prognosis. METHOD: 59 patients with coronary heart disease complicated by moderate to severe sleep apnea were divided into a CPAP treatment group (CPAP + coronary heart disease standard treatment) and a control group (only coronary heart disease standard treatment). Peripheral blood test reports were collected and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements were performed for each patient at the beginning, 3 months, and 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment, the CPAP group showed more significant improvement in the levels of inflammatory factors such as white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (N), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), and PWV than the control group. CONCLUSION: After active treatment with CPAP, arterial stiffness and inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with coronary heart disease and OSA improved. This association should be given more attention in clinical practice, and sleep apnea should be actively treated.",

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of CPAP on daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms while assessing how improvements vary with age. A total of 98 participants diagnosed with OSA were included in this study. Pretreatment and posttreatment scores for daytime sleepiness [Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)], depression [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)], and anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)] were collected. Improvements were calculated as the difference between pretreatment and posttreatment scores. Age, sex, ethnicity, apnea-hypopnea index, and CPAP compliance, were analyzed. Significant improvements were observed across all age groups after CPAP treatment: ESS scores improved by a mean of 5.6 points (P < 0.001), PHQ scores improved by 6.3 points (P < 0.001), and GAD scores improved by 1.1 points (P = 0.002). CPAP therapy effectively reduced daytime sleepiness, depression, and anxiety in patients with OSA, with significant age-related differences in outcomes. Younger individuals benefited most from treatment."

A retrospective cohort study of all children > 2 years old from a single tertiary paediatric centre prescribed continuous positive airway pressure therapy over an 8-year period was conducted.

Continuous positive airway pressure therapy adherence was determined using data from machine download. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to determine participant demographic and clinical factors associated with positional obstruction. Positional obstructive sleep apnea (defined by Bignold's criteria modified for paediatric use) prevalence in the cohort of 237 analysed participants was 38%. Suboptimal continuous positive airway pressure adherence was noted in 30% of this group based on initial machine download, performed a median of 96 days post-treatment initiation. Higher age and lower obstructive apnea-hypopnea index were independent predictors of positional obstructive sleep apnea, whereas neurodevelopmental diagnosis, presence/absence of rapid eye movement-related obstructive sleep apnea, overweight/obesity status and history of adenoidectomy/adenotonsillectomy were not. For children, positional device therapy is a treatment option worthy of further consideration and research."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. Longer term, repeated episodes of hypercapnia and hypoxemia during sleep are associated with inflammatory and atherosclerosis-related factors. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on cerebral vasoreactivity and early atherosclerosis in patients with severe OSAHS. METHODS: Forty-one patients with severe OSAHS were enrolled. The mean follow-up time was 39.8 ± 9.1 months. Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed, and laboratory tests, carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CRC) measurement were performed. After the baseline examination, 28 patients received CPAP therapy (treated group), which was not available for 13 patients (untreated group). Parameters were compared before and after treatment, between treated and untreated patients. RESULTS: Cardiovascular risk factors, baseline polysomnographic parameters, laboratory values, CIMT and CRC of the two groups were similar at baseline. At the follow-up, CRC did not differ between the two groups, but CIMT was significantly lower in the treated group than in the untreated group (0.73 ± 0.11 mm vs. 0.84 ± 0.21 mm, p = 0.027). The CIMT of both groups increased significantly during the follow-up period (from 0.65 ± 0.11 mm to 0.73 ± 0.11 mm in the treated group, and from 0.69 ± 0.11 mm to 0.84 ± 0.21 mm in the untreated group), but the increase in the treated group was smaller than in the untreated group (0.09 ± 0.09 mm vs. 0.15 ± 0.15 mm). CONCLUSION: In patients with severe OSAHS, CPAP treatment significantly reduced the progression of CIMT.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is used to treat patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and has proven clinical efficacy for this condition. However, the objective method to determine the appropriate CPAP level for treatment is still unclear. Patients with OSA typically exhibit irregular respiratory efforts due to obstruction or narrowing of the upper airway during sleep. Treatment with an adequate CPAP level alleviates airway obstruction or narrowing, leading to more regular respiratory patterns. We aimed to develop an objective CPAP titration method using the respiratory regularity index (RRI) derived from respiratory movements. Methods: We conducted daytime CPAP titration in 10 patients with OSA. Respiratory movements were recorded by inductance plethysmography in three conditions: wake, apnea, and during CPAP therapy. The RRI of respiratory movements was calculated in each condition, and the CPAP level with the lowest RRI was identified as the appropriate air pressure level in each patient. CPAP therapy at the appropriate level determined by the study method was conducted for 2 months, after which efficacy was assessed by night polysomnography in the hospital. Results: The fixed air pressure level for the CPAP device was determined as 7.8 ± 0.7 cmH2O based on our daytime CPAP titration method using the RRI. The apnea-hypopnea index improved significantly from before CPAP therapy (43.1 ± 15.3 h-1) to during CPAP therapy (3.0 ± 2.1 h-1) (p < 0.006). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score decreased significantly during CPAP therapy. The lowest percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation values in each sleep stage also improved significantly with the CPAP determined by our daytime CPAP titration method. Conclusions: The study findings showed that our daytime CPAP titration method based on the RRI is an effective method for determining individualized appropriate CPAP levels in patients with OSA. The RRI-based daytime CPAP titration method offers a simplified approach to determining the adequate CPAP level for patients with OSA."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was a retrospective cross-sectional study (2021) investigating the records of 200 adult patients with the medical diagnosis of acute respiratory failure (ARF) of COVID-19, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Shoushtar (southwestern Iran) who underwent CPAP therapy. The Heart rate, Acidosis, Consciousness, Oxygenation, and Respiratory rate (HACOR) scores were measured before the treatment and 1 h after undergoing CPAP treatment. Moreover, patients' demographic and clinical data were recorded. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney, Chi-square, Wilcoxon, and logistic regression tests. The significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: The mean standard deviation [SD]) age of patients was 63.96 (16.23) years. Among all 200 patients, 78.50% (n = 157) experienced CPAP failure and the remaining 21.50% (n = 43) underwent successful CPAP therapy. Failure chance was 7.10% higher in patients with higher HACOR scores undergoing 1 h CPAP treatment than others. It was also 14.92% higher among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) than non-DM patients. Additionally, old age (z = 2591.50, p value = 0.02), obesity (z = 2433.00, p value = 0.024), and elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) (z = 2620.00, p value = 0.0) impacted CPAP failure rates among patients. CONCLUSIONS: The HACOR score 1 h after CPAP, DM, old age, obesity, and elevated BUN favor increased CPAP failure rates among patients."

      "abstract": "An accumulating body of evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between sleep and cardiovascular (CV) health. A high level of evidence has linked obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Accordingly, clinical sleep medicine emphasizes the diagnosis and treatment of OSA in the context of promoting CV health. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the mainstay treatment for OSA, is effective in improving several sleep-related quality-of-life outcomes and leads to modest reductions in blood pressure, there is currently insufficient evidence to justify using CPAP alone for improving CVD outcomes in OSA. Sleep physicians are uniquely positioned to expand their focus beyond the evaluation of OSA and administering CPAP, in efforts to enhance the CV health of sleep patients. Herein, we suggest the role of sleep physicians as CV preventionists. Key focus areas for managing CV risk beyond CPAP therapy in OSA include identifying comorbid disorders that are vital for optimizing CV health. This involves risk-stratifying patients and providing appropriate counseling, referrals, and treatment as appropriate for comorbid sleep conditions such as insomnia and insufficient sleep, comorbid CV risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, as well as counseling for weight management programs, smoking, and alcohol cessation. We urge sleep clinicians to play an active and integral role in optimizing the CV health of patients with sleep disorders."

The secondary aim was to identify predictive factors for the long-term use of OA in patients with CPAP failure. METHODS: A total of 81 patients who failed with CPAP use were included in this study. Patients who had been using OA for more than 1 year at follow-up visits were assigned to Group S, whereas those who discontinued OA or were lost to follow-up within 1 year were assigned to Group D. We investigated the continuation and success rates of OA therapy, as well as predictive factors for its long-term use for those with CPAP failure. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients, 60 were in Group S and 21 were in Group D; 74.0% of patients with CPAP failure continued OA therapy for more than 1 year. The apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 41.3±21.7/h to 12.4±6.5/h with OA therapy. The only significant predictor of long-term OA use in patients with CPAP failure was awareness of the effectiveness of OA therapy after 1 month (P = 0.003, odds ratio: 9.731, 95% confidence interval: 2.146-44.119). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who recognized the effectiveness of OA treatment in the early stages were more likely to continue using OA therapy long-term."

The efficacy of CPAP therapy was assessed through changes in sleep and respiratory parameters before and after titration.  Results: The results demonstrated significant improvements in polysomnographic parameters, including reductions in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), total respiratory index (TRI), and desaturation index, as well as increases in mean REM sleep time and sleep efficiency. A third of the patients (n=23, 33%) required additional titration with alternative ventilatory modes, such as BiPAP or auto-SV. CONCLUSION: Hospital-based CPAP titration is essential in managing severe OSA, optimizing therapeutic outcomes, and ensuring personalized treatment. CPAP was effective in controlling nocturnal hypoventilation, reducing the need for BiPAP in many cases."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) presents a significant global health concern, affecting a substantial portion of the population, particularly among young and middle-aged adults. AIM: This review aims to assess the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared to antihypertensive medications in managing OSA-related hypertension. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, yielding studies published from 2000 to March 2024 that investigated CPAP, antihypertensives, or their combination therapy in OSA patients. Six definitive studies were analyzed, including two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, one placebo-controlled trial, one open-label multicenter trial, and one longitudinal cohort study. These studies comprised 939 participants, with intervention durations ranging from four weeks to six months. RESULTS: Analysis of CPAP monotherapy revealed variable efficacy, with some studies demonstrating significant reductions in 24-hour mean blood pressure and diastolic pressure, while others reported non-significant changes. CPAP therapy combined with antihypertensives showed additive effects, particularly in reducing office blood pressure measurements. Antihypertensive medications, such as valsartan, exhibited superior efficacy in reducing blood pressure compared to CPAP alone. Factors influencing therapy effectiveness included CPAP compliance, patient characteristics, and coexisting comorbidities. Patients with good CPAP adherence experienced greater reductions in blood pressure. The duration of exposure to OSA and the type of hypertension also impacted the therapy response. CONCLUSION: While CPAP and antihypertensive medications offer significant benefits in managing hypertension among OSA patients, challenges such as CPAP intolerance and medication side effects exist. Personalized treatment considering individual patient factors is crucial for optimal management.",

The patient was admitted to our hospital due to a COPD exacerbation. Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated marked coronal shortening and narrowing, sagittal widening of the intrathoracic trachea, and bronchiolitis. The tracheal index (TI) was less than two-thirds. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy resolved the type 2 respiratory failure, effectively improving the TI in the dilated coronal trachea. Considering the percentage of low-attenuation areas, airway trapping was observed in CT images. This case report demonstrated that CPAP therapy may improve the narrowing of the central and peripheral airways."

Sawtooth waves (STWs) are a characteristic of REM sleep. OBJECTIVE: To examine effects of CPAP treatment on STWs during REM sleep in the OSA patients. METHODS: Polysomnographic recordings were performed on 20 moderate-to-severe OSA patients and 16 normal controls, and comparisons of STWs during REM sleep in the OSA patients with and without CPAP treatment (paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test wherever appropriate), and between OSA patients and normal controls (Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) were carried out. In addition, linear correlation analyses were used to estimate the relationship of STWs and REM sleep with duration of non-REM (NREM) sleep stage 3 (N3). RESULTS: The STWs were classified to be apnea/hypopnea associated and not associated (isolated), and the amplitude of the isolated STWs was significantly higher than that of the apnea/hypopnea associated. With CPAP treatment, the percentage of REM sleep with STWs and the amplitude of STWs were significantly increased to the levels, which were not significantly different from those in the normal controls, while the frequency of STWs was not significantly changed. In addition, the total duration of REM sleep and the duration of REM sleep with STWs were both positively correlated with the duration of N3 sleep in the normal controls and the OSA patients with CPAP treatment. Furthermore, CPAP treatment also caused a significant increase in the duration of rapid eye movements in REM sleep. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that there are some interconnections between NREM and REM sleep, and STWs not only represent the quality of REM sleep but also are correlated with N3 sleep."

OSA is often under-recognised and under-treated in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to investigate possible differences in major cardiovascular events (MACE) incidence and Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) recurrence between patients receiving Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment versus no CPAP treatment, in a cohort of elderly OSA patients with several comorbidities and history of PAF. METHODS: In this prospective observational study we enrolled 420 patients aged ≥65 years, suffering from PAF, with a first diagnosis of moderate/severe OSA and indication for CPAP-mode ventilotherapy. Patients underwent clinical-instrumental and laboratory evaluation for a mean follow-up of 22.0 months. RESULTS: CPAP treatment added on usual pharmacological care was associated with a reduced risk of MACE (HR 0.31, p < 0.001) and recurrence of PAF (HR 0.33, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study supports the role of moderate/severe OSA as a risk factor for MACE and recurrent AF. CPAP treatment with optimal compliance and good tolerability, combined with usual medical care for cardiometabolic comorbidities, is associated with a lower incidence of MACE and recurrent PAF in elderly with several comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) is a low-cost, non-invasive respiratory support therapy for children with respiratory distress, but its effectiveness is dependent on the context. We aimed to understand contextual factors influencing bCPAP implementation for children aged 1-59 months in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and to develop a theory explaining how these factors influence implementation outcomes. METHODS: In this realist review, we generated an initial programme theory comprising candidate context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs) via review of key references and team discussion. On July 25, 2023, we conducted a search for peer-reviewed and grey literature, without date restrictions, describing bCPAP use for paediatric respiratory distress in LMICs. We included references describing related contexts, mechanisms, or outcomes. We coded statements from the literature supporting each CMOC, iteratively revising and adding CMOCs using inductive and deductive logic. We assembled an international, interdisciplinary panel of 22 bCPAP stakeholders to refine CMOCs using iterative surveys, focus groups, and interviews until we reached thematic saturation. This realist review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023403584). FINDINGS: Of 1640 peer-reviewed references and eight grey literature references retrieved, 38 peer-reviewed articles and two grey literature documents were deemed eligible for inclusion after removal of duplicates and screening. After four rounds of expert surveys and three focus groups, we identified 18 CMOCs. CMOCs were synthesised into a final programme theory operating at five levels to influence implementation feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability: (1) the bCPAP device, (2) local partnerships and infrastructure, (3) clinical and technical teams, (4) caregivers and the community, and (5) institutional practices. INTERPRETATION: Using realist methods with a diverse, international stakeholder panel, we generated a theory that could explain how bCPAP therapy works in different contexts. This theory could be leveraged to enhance the rigour of future bCPAP implementation trials.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been reported to influence the ocular surface and may lead to dry eye disease (DED). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line conservative treatment for OSA. However, CPAP might also have mask-related side effects that could deteriorate DED simultaneously. This study investigated the impact of OSA on DED (Aim 1), and CPAP on DED (Aim 2). Five databases were searched for articles published up to May, 2024. OSA severity, CPAP usage, and DED parameters, including tear breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer test, Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), and Corneal Fluorescence Staining Score (CFS), were analyzed. For Aim 1, the random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the leave-one-out method was used for sensitivity analysis. For Aim 2, a narrative synthesis with critical appraisal of the literature was performed. Eleven studies with 1,526 patients for Aim 1 and three studies with 180 patients for Aim 2 were included. For Aim 1, OSA patients had poorer dry eye profiles of TBUT, Schirmer test, and OSDI when compared to non-OSA patients. For Aim 2, it seemed that those wearing CPAP for less than half a year did not have enough improvement in dry eye status. Instead, those wearing CPAP for at least a year reached greater therapeutic effects for OSA and DED. We concluded that OSA patients may suffer from poorer dry eye condition compared to non-OSA patients. Besides, wearing CPAP for long enough duration (at least 1 year) seemed to have better improvement in DED."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) continues to be low with high termination rates. Alternative therapies to CPAP are needed. Our objective was to compare objective adherence to CPAP and mandibular advancement splints (MAS) and to evaluate their effectiveness, and additionally to identify treatment usage patterns and the clinical effectiveness of having both therapies. METHODS: This multicentre, double-randomised, three-phase trial (titration/crossover/observation) was conducted at three Canadian universities. Eligible participants were treatment-naïve with mild-to-severe OSA. The primary outcome was objectively measured adherence (hours per night) during the crossover phase. Secondary outcomes included efficacy during the crossover phase; adherence during the observational phase; and patient-centred outcomes, blood pressure and side-effects during the crossover and observational phases. Duration of the crossover and observational phase was 2.5 and 6 months, respectively. RESULTS: 81 participants were enrolled in the first randomisation. 79 entered the adaptation/titration phase (mean±sd age 52.3±10.8 years; 58 males), 73 entered the crossover phase (included in the intention-to-treat analysis) and 64 completed the observational phase. Mean objective adherence over 1 month: MAS showed higher adherence than CPAP, 6.0 versus 5.3 h·night-1 (difference 0.7 (95% CI 0.3-1.2) h·night-1; p<0.001). Mean CPAP-MAS difference in efficacy: 10.4 (95% CI 7.8-13.0) events·h-1; p<0.001. During the observational phase 55% (35 out of 64) of participants chose to alternate therapies. All treatments led to substantial improvement in patient-centred outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher efficacy of CPAP and higher adherence to MAS, both demonstrate comparable clinical effectiveness on patient-centred outcomes. Having both CPAP and MAS can improve long-term management of OSA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and has a detrimental effect on vascular function, in particular on arterial stiffness and endothelial function. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold-standard therapy for OSAS and its effects on arterial stiffness and endothelial function have been demonstrated in non-elderly patients. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of one year of CPAP treatment on arterial stiffness, through assessment of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), and on endothelial function, through the reactive hyperaemia index (RHi), in a real-life cohort of elderly patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS and several comorbidities. METHODS: In this nonrandomised prospective study, we enrolled 469 consecutive elderly patients affected by moderate-to-severe OSAS distributed in two groups: CPAP-treated (n = 225) and untreated patients (n = 244). RESULTS: At one-year follow-up, in the treated group emerged an important improvement in poligraphics (AHI, ODI, TC90, mean SpO2%), laboratory (HOMA index, eGFR, hs-CRP) and vascular function parameters: cf-PWV. The stepwise multivariate linear regression demonstrated a significant correlation between the delta of the polygraph parameters and the delta of PWV and RHi. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the favourable effects of CPAP therapy in a cohort of elderly patients affected by OSAS and several comorbidities on sleep respiratory parameters and vascular function; early diagnosis and treatment with CPAP might be beneficial to delay or prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular events in these groups of patients."

We aim to report on the feasibility of H-CPAP for selected infants with bronchiolitis in a pediatric ward. (2) Methods: A retrospective, observational, consecutive case series was studied of 26 patients who received H-CPAP on the pediatric ward from October 2022 to February 2023, including a description of patient outcomes and costs. (3) Results: Of 130 infants with bronchiolitis admitted to Bambino Gesù Hospital in Rome, 34 were hospitalized for moderate to severe bronchiolitis, and 26 began H-CPAP on the ward. Among the 26 pediatric patients who received H-CPAP on the ward, 4 out of 26 (15%) required transfer to the PICU within the first hours of care due to clinical deterioration. No problems with the H-CPAP interface or side effects attributable to H-CPAP were reported. Pharmacological sedation with a single dose of dexmedetomidine was required for 15/26 patients (57%) following failure of non-pharmacological anxiety reduction strategies. After introducing H-CPAP in our pediatric ward, we achieved total cost savings of approximately EUR 147,120. (4) Conclusions: Treatment with H-CPAP for infants with bronchiolitis may be feasible in non-intensive care settings with trained staff, appropriate monitoring, and rapid access to pediatric intensive care."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study investigated variations in gut microbiota among severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients and changes in gut microbiota after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. METHOD: From November 2020 to August 2021, laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) was used to measure sleep parameters in healthy controls, severe OSA patients, and severe OSA patients treated with CPAP for three months. A fully automated biochemical analyzer was used to evaluate routine blood tests and biochemical indicators. Whole-genome metagenomic analysis was used to determine the microbial composition of gut samples from all participants. The relationships between gut microbiota and hypertension were examined using correlation analysis. RESULT: The relative abundances of Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Parabacteroides were significantly lower at the species level. Enterobacterales and Turicibacter were significantly higher in participants with severe OSA than healthy controls. Negative correlations were identified between Bacteroides coprocola and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (r =  - 0.710, P = 0.003) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r =  - 0.615, P = 0.015). Conversely, a positive correlation was found between Escherichia coli and SBP (r = 0.568, P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: The metabolic pathways and gut microbiota differed significantly between the control group and individuals with severe OSA. Additionally, CPAP therapy substantially changed the metabolic pathways and gut microbial composition among patients diagnosed with severe OSA. Correlation analysis further revealed a strong association between Escherichia coli, Bacteroides coprocola, and blood pressure levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are two widely used modes of non-invasive respiratory support in paediatric critical care units. The FIRST-ABC randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of HFNC compared with CPAP in two distinct critical care populations: acutely ill children ('step-up' RCT) and extubated children ('step-down' RCT). Clinical effectiveness findings (time to liberation from all forms of respiratory support) showed that HFNC was non-inferior to CPAP in the step-up RCT, but failed to meet non-inferiority criteria in the step-down RCT. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of HFNC versus CPAP. METHODS: All-cause mortality, health-related Quality of Life (HrQoL), and costs up to six months were reported using FIRST-ABC RCTs data. HrQoL was measured with the age-appropriate Paediatric Quality of Life Generic Core Scales questionnaire and mapped onto the Child Health Utility 9D index score at six months. Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were estimated by combining HrQoL with mortality. Costs at six months were calculated by measuring and valuing healthcare resources used in paediatric critical care units, general medical wards and wider health service. The cost-effectiveness analysis used regression methods to report the cost-effectiveness of HFNC versus CPAP at six months and summarised the uncertainties around the incremental cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: In both RCTs, the incremental QALYs at six months were similar between the randomised groups. The estimated incremental cost at six months was - £4565 (95% CI - £11,499 to £2368) and - £5702 (95% CI - £11,328 to - £75) for step-down and step-up RCT, respectively. The incremental net benefits of HFNC versus CPAP in step-down RCT and step-up RCT were £4388 (95% CI - £2551 to £11,327) and £5628 (95% CI - £8 to £11,264) respectively. The cost-effectiveness results were surrounded by considerable uncertainties. The results were similar across most pre-specified subgroups, and the base case results were robust to alternative assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC compared to CPAP as non-invasive respiratory support for critically-ill children in paediatric critical care units reduces mean costs and is relatively cost-effective overall and for key subgroups, although there is considerable statistical uncertainty surrounding this result.",

Arterial stiffness is characterized by morphofunctional changes in the arteries and its assessment can be obtained non-invasively mainly through the measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV). Arterial stiffness has been proposed as a predictor of cardiovascular diseases. OBJECTIVE: To compare arterial stiffness as well as QoL in patients diagnosed with moderate to severe OSA treated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Mandibular Advancement Appliance (MAA) therapies. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 105 participants diagnosed with moderate to severe OSA categorized into three independent groups: A Non-treated Control Group and CPAP and MAA treated Groups. QoL was assessed by the Quebec Sleep Questionnaire (QSQ) and arterial stiffness was assessed noninvasively by Mobil-O-Graph. RESULTS: The groups were homogeneous, except for the polysomnographic parameters Apnea and Hypopnea Index (AHI) (p = 0.036) and Minimum O2 saturation (p = 0.011) (evaluated to diagnose the OSA condition before treatment) and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p < 0.001). The MAA group presented higher scores in all QoL domains (p < 0.05), except Social Interactions in relation to the Control group. For the CPAP group, only Nocturnal Symptoms presented significantly higher scores compared to the control group (p = 0.39). For Arterial Stiffness, no statistical differences were observed among comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show better QoL scores in patients with OSA treated by CPAP and mainly by MAA. Differently, arterial stiffness parameters did not differ between the groups treated with CPAP and MAA and the control group.",

The association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and otolaryngological manifestations appears to be underrecognized. This study posits that manifestations in the ear, nose and throat (ENT) among patients with OSAS and users of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy are relatively common. Utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement, this systematic review, registered at PROSPERO (No. CRD42023452473), involved a comprehensive search of the MEDLINE databases. We included studies published in English from 1979 to March 2021 that explored the linkages between OSAS, CPAP and otolaryngological manifestations. A total of 29 articles were reviewed, with findings indicating 12 studies on ear dysfunctions, 11 on nose dysfunctions and 6 on pharynx dysfunctions. Reported symptoms included hearing dysfunction, vestibular function disorders, cerebrospinal fluid leak, Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction, rhinosinusitis, olfaction and taste disorders, dysphagia, dry mouth, and gastroesophageal reflux. The etiology of these ailments varies, yet an understanding of these symptoms can improve the diagnosis to confirm or rule out OSAS. Early identification of ENT symptoms related to OSAS may facilitate prompt diagnosis and mitigate serious complications."

This study identifies factors influencing CPAP adherence, including the impact of Korea's four distinct seasons. A retrospective study of 650 patients with OSA and prescribed with CPAP was conducted at a single institution from January 2018 to December 2020, and the patients' answers on various sleep questionnaires, demographic and polysomnographic data, and when and whether they returned the CPAP devices were collected and analyzed. The sample population was divided into when and whether the CPAP device was returned to the institution and the average daily use of the CPAP device. Results show that treatment failure is high in the first 12 weeks. Moreover, patients with more severe sleep apnea tended to have severe OSA-related clinical symptoms and are more likely to adhere to the treatment. In this study show that the seasons did not affect CPAP adherence because of indoor environmental factors. However, results show that other patient factors, such as BMI, AHI, RDI, daytime drowsiness, mood changes, and other OSA-related symptoms, have greater effects on CPAP adherence than seasonal change. Initial positive experience is important to adapt to the CPAP, and for this reason, more active intervention by sleep physicians during the initial CPAP adaptation is necessary."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Japan's health insurance system allowed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) telephone consultations to extend clinic visit intervals. This study aimed to determine whether 6-month CPAP adherence in the telemedicine (TM) group was inferior to that in the standard care group. METHODS: Patients receiving long-term CPAP therapy for at least 6 months for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from two clinics in Japan were recruited between May and July 2020. The TM group consisted of patients who had not visited the clinic in person for 6 months, with physicians providing telephone consultations every 1-2 months. The standard care group included patients who visited the clinic monthly for physician consultation. In both groups, physicians reviewed CPAP usage data via telemonitoring. Patients were classified into three groups according to change in adherence: ≤ -5%, > -5 to <5%, and ≥5%. The primary outcome was the number of patients with worsened CPAP adherence (≤-5%). RESULTS: Of the 479 patients in the TM group and 146 in the standard care group, 120 were matched using propensity score 1:1 nearest neighbor matching and selected from both groups. Adherence worsened in 41 (34.2%) and 32 (26.7 %) patients in the TM and standard care groups, respectively. The TM group was not inferior to the standard care group in terms of the proportion of patients with worsened CPAP adherence (χ2 = 1.81, df = 1, P = 0.178). CONCLUSIONS: This study found no significant difference in the 6-month CPAP adherence between the TM and standard care groups.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs) play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) causes abnormalities of CMRFs. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a widely used treatment for OSA. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of CPAP on CMRFs in patients with OSA. METHODS: A search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase was conducted to find randomized controlled trials up to December 3, 2023. The quality of the studies included was evaluated using the Cochrane Bias Risk Tool 2.0, and a meta-analysis was carried out using Stata15.1 software. The effect sizes for this meta-analysis were represented as the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95 % confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 52 studies with 10,104 participants were analyzed. The results showed that CPAP significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (WMD: -2.04 mmHg; 95%CI: -3.56 to -0.51), diastolic blood pressure (WMD: -1.40 mmHg; 95%CI: -2.36 to -0.44), total cholesterol (WMD: -0.27 mmol/L; 95%CI: -0.51 to -0.04), triglycerides (WMD: -0.02 mmol/L; 95%CI: -0.03 to -0.01), and fasting blood glucose (WMD: -0.15 mmol/L; 95%CI: -0.16 to -0.13) in patients with OSA. However, there was no significant change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, waist circumference, or body mass index after CPAP. CONCLUSION: In summary, this meta-analysis demonstrated that CPAP effectively reduced certain CMRFs in patients with OSA, offering new insights for cardiovascular disease prevention.

      "abstract": "Rationale: In patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) measured off CPAP may be decreased relative to baseline AHI preceding CPAP treatment. Semiinvasive \"endophenotyping\" sleep studies attribute this fall in AHI primarily to improved ventilatory control stability. Phenotyping Using Polysomnography (PUP) attempts to reproduce these studies using routine polysomnography (PSG). Objectives: To determine whether changes in AHI after CPAP associate primarily with changes in PUP-estimated ventilatory control stability (loop gain with a 1-minute cycle time [LG1]) or with changes in other PUP-estimated pathophysiologic mechanisms. Methods: PUP analyses were performed on existing PSGs in research participants who underwent baseline PSG, 4.4 ± 2.2 months of CPAP therapy, and CPAP withdrawal with repeat PSG on Night 2 of withdrawal. Pre-CPAP PUP-estimated LG1, arousal threshold, and upper airway collapsibility (Vpassive) and muscular compensation (Vcomp) were compared with corresponding values during CPAP withdrawal. Mixed-effects models were constructed to determine which PUP estimate best explained changes in AHI. Results: PSG data were available for 35 participants (mean age, 47 ± 10.8 yr; 12 women; mean body mass index, 38.5 ± 8.6 kg/m2; mean AHI with hypopneas defined according to 3% oxygen desaturation and/or arousal, 58.8 ± 33.1 events/h; 9 participants with mild/moderate OSA and 26 with severe OSA). After CPAP, AHI decreased, but the change was not statistically significant. However, a significant decrease was observed in those with severe OSA (pre-CPAP 68.2 [32.6-86.3] vs. CPAP withdrawal 49.0 [36.1-74.4] events/h). Across all participants, changes in PUP estimates did not exceed test-retest agreement limits. For those with severe OSA, decrease in LG1 (0.86 [0.61-1.13] before CPAP vs. 0.71 [0.61-0.99] on CPAP withdrawal) and increase in Vpassive (fraction of eupneic ventilation 64.8% [5.4-88.4%] before CPAP vs. 76.4% [20.7-92.7%] on CPAP withdrawal) exceeded test-retest agreement limits. Increased Vpassive, decreased LG1, and decreased arousal threshold were predictors of decreased AHI in mixed-effects models. Vpassive had the greatest estimated effect on AHI. After accounting for Vpassive, additional estimates did not improve model performance. However, Vpassive and LG1 were correlated, and post hoc analyses suggest that these estimates may be influenced by both upper airway collapsibility and ventilatory control. Conclusions: According to PUP physiologic estimates, decreases in AHI after several months of CPAP therapy are attributable primarily to improved upper airway collapsibility.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Mouth air leak is a major cause of low adherence to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, CPAP reports do not distinguish mouth leak from mask leak. We hypothesized that mouth air leak is terminated abruptly by an arousal from sleep and mouth closing that can be detected by CPAP leak waveform analysis. Objectives: To describe patterns of mouth air leak waveform during polysomnography (PSG) in patients with OSA treated with well-fitted nasal CPAP. Methods: PSG recordings with a jaw motion sensor to detect mouth opening were performed in patients with OSA treated with nasal CPAP with suspected mouth air leak. Careful mask fitting and visual inspection excluded mask leak. Mouth leak episodes were characterized by an increase (⩾20%) above the intentional leak. Leak episodes were classified as intermittent (<5 minutes) or continuous (⩾5 minutes). Results: Twenty patients (80% men; age, 63 ± 11 years; body mass index, 29.9 ± 6 kg/m2; baseline apnea-hypopnea index, 46.9 ± 19 events per hour) treated with nasal CPAP and documented mouth leak completed the study. All but one patient experienced an overlap of intermittent and continuous mouth leak. Most mouth leak episodes ended with mouth closure (97.7%) and an arousal (52.7%) or awakening (38.6%). Only 34.9% of the leak episodes were associated with respiratory events. Intermittent mouth air leak was more common in sleep stages N1 and N2 (P < 0.01), whereas continuous leak was more common in sleep stage N3 (P < 0.01). Continuous episodes of air leak were associated with a higher amplitude of mouth opening. The CPAP report waveform was able to detect only 29.6% of the leak episodes detected by PSG. Only 10 patients (50%) had a high unintentional leak according to the criteria adopted by ResMed, and only 2 patients (10%) presented large leak according to the Philips criteria. Conclusions: Intermittent and continuous mouth leak during nasal CPAP frequently coexist and contribute to sleep fragmentation. Identification of leak waveform patterns may help detect mouth air leak, which, in turn, is an important cause of poor CPAP adherence.",

The discrimination of the nomogram was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Pulmonary disease, oxygen desaturation index (ODI), Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and severity of OSA were identified as predictors and incorporated into the nomogram. The nomogram demonstrated good discrimination with concordance index in training dataset (0.73, 95% CI: 0.69-0.78) and validation dataset (0.72, 95% CI: 0.66-0.79). ROC curve, calibration curve, and DCA indicated the nomogram had good clinical utility. CONCLUSION: This study provided an effective nomogram for predicting CPAP non-adherence in OSA patients."

Limited data exists comparing long term cardiovascular disease (CVD) clinical outcomes for patients treated with surgical intervention versus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The purpose of this study was to compare CVD outcomes at multiple time points comparing those treated with sleep surgery versus CPAP alone. METHODS: A research database was used to assess outcomes: death, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, essential hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension at 5, 8, and 20 years for patients with OSA treated with surgical interventions (upper airway stimulation [UAS], uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP], and tonsillectomy) or CPAP alone. Subjects were identified using ICD and CPT codes and analyses were conducted with and without propensity score matching for age, sex, race, BMI, myocardial infarction (MI), essential hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. RESULTS: All surgical interventions demonstrated benefit over CPAP alone at most time points for most surgical interventions. At 8 years, for all sleep surgeries (UAS or UPPP or tonsillectomy) (n = 6627) versus treatment with CPAP alone (n = 6627), matched subjects demonstrated decreased risk (odds ratios) and superior survival (hazard ratios and log ranks tests) for death (OR = 0.49 [0.39, 0.62] P ≤ .0001, HR = 0.29 [0.23, 0.37], χ2 = 109.58 P ≤ .0001), myocardial infarction (OR = 0.67 [0.54, 0.84] P = .0005*, HR = 0.48 [0.38, 0.60], χ2 = 42.40 P ≤ .0001), atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.70 [0.59, 0.83] P ≤ .0001, HR = 0.54 [0.45, 0.64], χ2 = 51.53 P ≤ .0001), heart failure (OR = 0.55 [0.47, 0.64] P ≤ .0001, HR = 0.41 [0.35, 0.47], χ2 = 137.416 P ≤ .0001), essential hypertension (OR = 0.88 [0.82, 0.94] P = .0002, HR = 0.78 [0.74, 0.82], χ2 = 76.38 P ≤ .0001), and pulmonary hypertension (OR = 0.51 [0.40, 0.65] P ≤ .0001, HR = 0.38 [0.29, 0.48], χ2 = 60.67 P ≤ .0001) where P ≤ .00037 indicated statistical significance*.

This study aims to explore the long-term effects on objective sleep parameters and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following different therapeutic interventions for OSA. Methods: Data from patients with moderate-to-severe OSA were retrospectively collected from a medical center and a regional hospital, spanning from December 2011 to August 2018. Objective evaluations included the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), minimum O2 saturation, and sleep efficiency. The PROs consisted of the Snore Outcomes Survey and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Using mixed-effects models, we evaluated longitudinal changes in sleep parameters and PROs, accounting for repeated measures and variations within individuals over time. Results: Among 448 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA, follow-up data were collected for 42 patients undergoing UPPP surgery, 171 undergoing PNS, 127 using CPAP, and 108 in the non-treated group. The mean follow-up was 16.7 months (SD = 11.9, range: 1.6-77.3). Significant improvements were observed in AHI, minimum O2 saturation, and hypersomnia immediately following interventions with UPPP, PNS, and CPAP therapy (p < 0.05). Moreover, the analysis revealed no significant rate of change in these parameters over time, suggesting that the benefits of these treatments were sustained in the long term. Furthermore, all interventions exhibited a significant short-term effect on self-reported snoring when compared to the control group, with a p-value of less than 0.001. However, the magnitude of this improvement gradually decreased over time. The snore scores seemed to return to pre-treatment levels among the UPPP, PNS, and CPAP groups after averages of 46.4, 63.5, and 74.4 months, respectively (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Surgical interventions and CPAP therapy showed potential long-term effectiveness in managing OSA. Snoring symptoms reappeared about 3.9-5.3 years after surgical treatments, which seemed earlier than the average of 6.2 years in patients receiving CPAP and should be considered in patient-participatory decision-making processes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants who are extubated following a period of invasive ventilation via an endotracheal tube are at risk of developing respiratory failure, leading to reintubation. This may be due to apnoea, respiratory acidosis, or hypoxia. Historically, preterm infants were extubated to head box oxygen or low-flow nasal cannulae. Support with non-invasive pressure might help improve rates of successful extubation in preterm infants by stabilising the upper airway, improving lung function, and reducing apnoea. This is an update of a review first published in 1997 and last updated in 2003. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), applied immediately after extubation of preterm infants, reduces the incidence of extubation failure and the need for additional ventilatory support, without clinically important adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries on 22 September 2023 using a revised strategy. We searched conference abstracts and the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Eligible trials employed random or quasi-random allocation of preterm infants undergoing extubation. Eligible comparisons were NCPAP (delivered by any device and interface) versus head box oxygen, extubation to room air, or any other form of low-pressure supplemental oxygen. We grouped the comparators under the term no continuous positive airway pressure (no CPAP). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. Where studies were sufficiently similar, we performed a meta-analysis, calculating risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data. For the primary outcomes that showed an effect, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for clinically important outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine trials (with 726 infants) in the quantitative synthesis of this updated review. Eight studies were conducted in high-income countries between 1982 and 2005. One study was conducted in Chile, which was classified as upper-middle income at the time of the study. All studies used head box oxygen in the control arm. Risk of bias was generally low. However, due to the inherent nature of the intervention, no studies incorporated blinding. Consequently, the neonatal intensive care unit staff were aware of the assigned group for each infant, and we judged all studies at high risk of performance bias. However, we assessed blinding of the outcome assessor (detection bias) as low risk for seven studies because they used objective criteria to define both primary outcomes. NCPAP compared with no CPAP may reduce the risk of extubation failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.76; risk difference (RD) -0.17, 95% -0.23 to -0.10; NNTB 6, 95% CI 4 to 10; I2 = 55%; 9 studies, 726 infants; low-certainty evidence) and endotracheal reintubation (RR 0.79, 95% 0.64 to 0.98; RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01; NNTB 15, 95% CI 8 to 100; I2 = 65%; 9 studies; 726 infants; very low-certainty evidence), though the evidence for endotracheal reintubation is very uncertain. NCPAP compared with no CPAP may have little or no effect on bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.68; RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.15; 1 study, 92 infants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported neurodevelopmental outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: NCPAP may be more effective than no CPAP in preventing extubation failure in preterm infants if applied immediately after extubation from invasive mechanical ventilation. We are uncertain whether it can reduce the risk of reintubation or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We have no information on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although there is only low-certainty evidence for the effectiveness of NCPAP immediately after extubation in preterm infants, we consider there is no need for further research on this intervention, which has become standard practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the leading cause of childhood mortality, and respiratory distress syndrome is the predominant cause of these deaths. Early continuous positive airway pressure is effective in high-resource settings, reducing the rate of continuous positive airway pressure failure, and the need for mechanical ventilation and surfactant. However, most deaths in preterm infants occur in low-resource settings without access to mechanical ventilation or surfactant. We hypothesize that in such settings, early continuous positive airway pressure will reduce the rate of failure and therefore preterm mortality. METHODS: This is a mixed methods feasibility and acceptability, single-center pilot randomized control trial of early continuous positive airway pressure among infants with birthweight 800-1500 g. There are two parallel arms: (i) application of continuous positive airway pressure; with optional oxygen when indicated; applied in the delivery room within 15 min of birth; transitioning to bubble continuous positive airway pressure after admission to the neonatal unit if Downes Score ≥ 4 (intervention), (ii) supplementary oxygen at delivery when indicated; transitioning to bubble continuous positive airways pressure after admission to the neonatal unit if Downes Score ≥ 4 (control). A two-stage consent process (verbal consent during labor, followed by full written consent within 24 h of birth) and a low-cost third-party allocation process for randomization will be piloted. We will use focus group discussions and key informant interviews to explore the acceptability of the intervention, two-stage consent process, and trial design. We will interview healthcare workers, mothers, and caregivers of preterm infants. Feasibility will be assessed by the proportion of infants randomized within 15 min of delivery; the proportion of infants in the intervention arm receiving CPAP within 15 min of delivery; and the proportion of infants with primary and secondary outcomes measured successfully. DISCUSSION: This pilot trial will enhance our understanding of methods and techniques that can enable emergency neonatal research to be carried out effectively, affordably, and acceptably in low-resource settings. This mixed-methods approach will allow a comprehensive exploration of parental and healthcare worker perceptions, experiences, and acceptance of the intervention and trial design.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Acute post-thyroidectomy bilateral vocal cord paresis or paralysis (BVCP) is often managed with observation, botulinum toxin injection or tracheostomy. However, only a few cases discuss obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the context of BVCP with limited exploration of home sleep test (HST) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as post-operative assessment and management tools. This study suggests CPAP as a less invasive approach while awaiting vocal cord recovery. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 2 female patients who presented with dyspnea and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms post-thyroidectomy. Both patients underwent laryngoscopy and HSTs, followed by CPAP prescription. RESULTS: Case 1 (body mass index [BMI]: 32.6 kg/m2) and Case 2 (BMI: 20.1 kg/m2), aged 66 and 77 respectively, presented with post-surgery dyspnea and SDB symptoms. Laryngoscopy revealed left vocal cord paresis and right vocal cord paralysis in both cases. Although tracheostomy could provide definitive treatment, both cases were deferred for non-invasive options, which led to HST, confirming moderate OSA (PAT-derived apnea-hypopnea index (pAHI): 18/hour and 27.1/hour) leading to CPAP recommendation. In Case 2, 5 weeks of CPAP use resulted in dramatic improvements in her sleep quality, with continued benefits at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: These cases underscore the value of considering sleep studies and CPAP as adjunctive tools in acute post-thyroidectomy BVCP management while awaiting vocal motion recovery. This report also further supports that BVCP sufficiently narrows the glottic airway, predisposing patients to OSA.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of facilitating target delineation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients undergoing stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) for lung tumors by lung expansion and respiratory motion management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective single-institutional trial of patients who were diagnosed with either primary lung cancer or lung metastases and received SABR with a dose of 40 to 60 Gy in 4 fractions. Four-dimensional computed tomography simulations were conducted for each patient: once without CPAP and again with CPAP. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with 39 tumors were analyzed, after the withdrawal of five patients due to discomfort. For 26 tumors separated from the diaphragm, CPAP significantly increased the superoinferior distance between the tumor and the diaphragm (5.96 cm vs. 8.06 cm; p < 0.001). For 13 tumors located adjacent to the diaphragm, CPAP decreased the overlap of planning target volume (PTV) with the diaphragm significantly (6.32 cm3 vs. 4.09 cm3; p = 0.002). PTV showed a significant reduction with CPAP (25.06 cm3 vs. 22.52 cm3, p = 0.017). In dosimetric analyses, CPAP expanded lung volume by 58.4% with a significant reduction in mean dose and V5 to V40. No more than grade 2 adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrated significant improvement of CPAP in target delineation uncertainties for lung SABR, with dosimetric benefits, a favorable safety profile and tolerability. Further investigation is warranted to explore the role of CPAP as a novel strategy for respiratory motion management."

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictors of persistent driving risk related to sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) treated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of a prospective national database including 5308 patients with OSAS and an indication of CPAP. Near misses related to sleepiness, accidents related to sleepiness, and sleepiness at the wheel (SAW) were assessed before initiation and after ≥90 days of treatment. Multivariable associations with the cumulative incidence of near-misses and accidents under treatment were calculated using Cox models adjusted for age, sex, obesity, sleep duration, SAW, accidents/near-misses history, depressive symptoms, residual apnea-hypopnea index, and adherence to treatment. RESULTS: Residual SAW under treatment was associated with an eight-fold higher incidence of near-misses related to sleepiness (hazard ratios [HR] = 8.63 [6.08-12.2]) and five-fold higher incidence of accidents related to sleepiness (HR = 5.24 [2.81-9.78]). Adherence ≤4 h/night was also a significant predictor of persistent driving risk (HR = 1.74 [1.12-2.71] for near-misses and HR = 3.20 [1.37-7.49] for accidents). CONCLUSIONS: Residual SAW and treatment adherence ≤4 h/night are easy-to-assess markers to detect persistent driving risk during the follow-up evaluations of patients under treatment. Health professionals, but also policymakers, should be aware of the crucial importance of systematically evaluating these elements during the follow-up evaluations of the patients with OSAS treated by CPAP to better evaluate their driving risk.",

The clinical significance of HB and ΔHR in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and their responses to therapy have not yet been investigated. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in reducing HB and ΔHR in children. METHODS: This analysis included 17 children (11 males, mean age: 12.6 ± 3.9 years) with obesity and/or medical complexity and moderate-to-severe OSA. Each participant underwent two additional sleep studies: one for HFNC titration and another for CPAP titration. HB and ΔHR were derived from the oximetry and pulse rate signals from overnight sleep studies, respectively. RESULTS: Both HFNC and CPAP demonstrated significant reductions in HB from baseline, with similar magnitudes [HFNC: -129 (standard error, SE 55) %min/h, p = 0.003; CPAP: -138 (SE 53) %min/h, p = 0.005]. However, for ΔHR, a significant reduction from baseline was observed only in the CPAP group [-2.7 (SE 1.1) beats/min, p = 0.049], not the HFNC group [-1.0 (SE 1.4) beats/min, p = 0.67]. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC is as effective as CPAP in treating hypoxia in children with OSA, but HFNC might be less effective than CPAP in mitigating cardiovascular stress from autonomic disturbances during obstructive events.",

METHODS: This implementation study was developed in 5 hospitals in Brazil and one in Belgium within four phases: (I) Situational diagnosis (professionals and patients' knowledge about CPAP usage for drained pleural effusion and checking medical records for the last 6 months); (II) Education and training of professionals; (III) New situational diagnosis (equal to phase I); (IV) Follow-up for two years. RESULTS: 65 professionals, 117 patients' medical records, and 64 patients were enrolled in this study. Initially, only 72% of medical records presented a description of interventions. CPAP usage was mentioned in only one patient with a chest tube. After phase III, the number of professionals who used CPAP for their patients with drained pleural effusion increased from 28.8% to 66.7%, p < 0.001. Similarly, the acceptability of this therapy for this clinical situation also increased among professionals from 6.4 ± 1.3 to 7.8 ± 1.4, p < 0.001. However, before the implementation, only one medical record described the use of CPAP in one patient with drained pleural effusion. After two years, the use of CPAP therapy by healthcare professionals for patients with drained thoracic drainage was sustained in 3 hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention for the use of CPAP in patients with drained pleural effusion was effective for health professionals. Results were sustained after two years in three of the six hospitals.",

OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the acute effect and safety of CPAP therapy on SDB and sleep architecture, as well as the clinical characteristics of nonresponders to CPAP therapy. METHODS: The measures of 63 consecutive patients with MSA who underwent a video-polysomnography during two consecutive nights (a first night in ambient air, a second night with or without CPAP, depending on the presence of SDB and availability of CPAP) in routine care were retrospectively collected. Linear mixed models assessed the two-night change in sleep and respiratory measures, comparing those with and without the CPAP therapy on the second night. RESULTS: SDB was frequent and mainly associated with the cerebellar phenotype. The introduction of CPAP had immediate benefits, including the normalization of the apnea-hypopnea index and a resolution of stridor in more than two-thirds of the cases, decreased arousal index, and increased rapid eye movement sleep. CPAP therapy was well tolerated, and only two patients had emergent central apneas. Nonresponse to CPAP was generally associated with more severe motor disease. CONCLUSIONS: CPAP seems a well-tolerated and effective therapy in patients with MSA and SDB in the short term. This treatment shows remarkable immediate benefits by objectively improving both respiratory disturbances and sleep architecture. © 2024 The Author(s).

METHOD: A comparative cross-sectional study design was employed. The research was conducted at Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Rawalpindi from November 2022 to July 2023. All consecutive neonates admitted during the specified period with respiratory distress requiring CPAP treatment and meeting inclusion criteria were enrolled. Pre- and post-CPAP respiratory distress levels, relevant biochemical markers, as well as mortality and morbidity rates were documented. Both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were employed. RESULTS: The mean age of the study cohort was 53.3±85.6 minutes. The average time to initiate CPAP was 82.4 ± 94.7 minutes. Mean gestational age stood at 34.68±2.8 weeks. CPAP was successful in 97% of babies. The low birth weight below 1200grams was the main factor related to failure of CPAP. The mean Downes score decreased from 5.8±1.3 before CPAP to 3.3±1.6 after 12 hours of CPAP and further to 1.85±2 after 24 hours. Significant improvements in Downes score were noted after 24 hours of CPAP usage (p < 0.05) using paired sample T-test. CONCLUSION: This study affirms the effectiveness of CPAP in addressing neonatal respiratory distress. The utilization of CPAP emerges as a valuable intervention that not only reduces the requirement for invasive ventilation but also exhibits the potential to alleviate morbidity and mortality rates among neonatal populations."

METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a national sample from the All of Us Research Program, which included over 80 % of participants from underrepresented populations in biomedical research. Study participants included adults aged 18 years and older diagnosed with OSA (N = 8518). Diagnosis of OSA and CPAP treatment were ascertained by diagnostic and procedural codes from the electronic health records. Sociodemographic characteristics and health service utilization factors were identified using self-reported survey data. RESULTS: With this national survey, the overall diagnosed prevalence of OSA was 8.8 %, with rates of 8.12 % in non-Hispanic (NH) Black adults, 5.99 % in Hispanic adults, and 10.35 % in NH White adults. When comparing to NH White adults, Hispanic adults were less likely to receive CPAP treatment for OSA after adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, access to and utilization of health services, and comorbidities such as obesity and having multiple chronic conditions (OR = 0.73, 95 % CI = 0.59,0.90), p < 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of CPAP treatment among OSA patients are not consistent across racial and ethnic groups. Unequal access to health services based on residence may contribute to these differences. Interventions that target disparities in OSA diagnosis, access to treatment, and barriers in insurance coverage could potentially help reduce racial and ethnic differences in OSA diagnosis and management.",

From a base of 138 patients, 83 were randomized to either CPAP or control. Nonstereoscopic 35º photographs were processed with Sirius software. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis showed no differences in AVR, although the arteriolar diameter increased from baseline in the CPAP group. Per-protocol analysis showed a 12-month increase in AVR (P = 0.035) and arteriolar diameter (P = 0.033) in CPAP versus control group. The venular diameter showed a nonstatistically significant reduction. CONCLUSIONS: CPAP is a potentially novel treatment for individuals with DR and concomitant OSA, improving the retinopathy status, reversing the arteriolar narrowing, and therefore increasing the AVR, tending to reduce the venular diameter.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with elevated endocan levels but the effects of treatment on endocan levels in OSA are not fully established. We aimed to determine whether endocan levels could be detected by immunoassay and to determine the effect of supplemental oxygen during continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) withdrawal on circulating endocan levels. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory analysis from a randomised controlled crossover study which included participants with OSA. Participants stopped their CPAP therapy and were randomised to receive either supplemental oxygen or sham for 14 nights before crossing over. Supplemental oxygen blocked the rise in blood pressure seen in the sham group. We analysed plasma endocan levels by immunoassay at baseline and after 14 nights of intervention in both groups. RESULTS: Twenty-five participants were included, with a total of 100 samples. Endocan levels were detectable at all time points in 22 participants (88%), and in 93 (93%) samples. Supplemental oxygen had no effect on endocan levels compared to sham (+ 0.52 ng/ml, 95%CI -0.21 to + 1.25, p = 0.16), and there was no significant difference in endocan levels from baseline to follow-up in either the sham (-0.30 ng/ml, 95%CI -0.89 to + 0.30, p = 0.31) or supplemental oxygen (+ 0.22 ng/ml, 95%CI 0.00 to + 0.44, p = 0.05) arm. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that endocan levels are detectable before and after CPAP withdrawal. However, we found no effect of supplemental oxygen following CPAP withdrawal on circulating endocan levels. TRIAL REGISTRATION AND DATE: ISRCTN 17,987,510 19/02/2015.",

The analysis evaluated a 5-year care pathway using a Markov model, considering per-patient costs of treatment, health system cost savings of obstructive sleep apnea and attributed conditions, the effectiveness measured in disability-adjusted life years with a discount rate of 3% and a weighted 5-year continuous positive airway pressure adherence of 74.1% from Singapore studies. Per-patient costs of treatment were from a large public hospital in Singapore. Efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure treatment, health system costs and disability-adjusted life years were obtained from literature; costs are in US dollars. We conducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis, one-way sensitivity analysis and what-if analysis. Based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of US $50,000 per disability-adjusted life year in USA, continuous positive airway pressure therapy was highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,822 per disability-adjusted life year averted. Compared with the annual total costs of $856 for patients with continuous positive airway pressure treatment diagnosed by an inpatient sleep study, the total costs for those diagnosed by a home sleep test were $625, resulting in a remarkable 27% reduction per patient per year. One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that costs of treatment, effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure treatment and adherence had a higher impact on the cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure therapy. The what-if analysis suggested that for continuous positive airway pressure treatment to be cost-effective, adherence rate should be at least 16.1%. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in making informed decisions on funding diagnosis and continuous positive airway pressure therapy within Singapore's healthcare system.",

Whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves these cognitive functions is still a matter of debate. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included OSA patients (apnea hypopnea index, AHI >10/h), naive to CPAP treatment, with a cognitive assessment before and after CPAP initiation. We compared CPAP versus sham-CPAP or placebo tablet or dietary rules or no treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis were registered in PROSPERO (ID CRD42021275214). RESULTS: Eleven RCTs encompassing 923 OSA patients were included. For most of them, CPAP initiation was ≤3 months. A significant post-treatment improvement was found for the Trail Making Test part B (TMT-B; SMD = -0.93, 95 % CI = [-1.60, -0.25], Z = -2.70, p = 0.007), but not for the other neuropsychological assessments. No global effects on other cognitive domains (information processing speed, executive functions, working memory) were found. CONCLUSION: The significant improvement in the TMT-B supports a short-term enhancement in cognitive flexibility with CPAP treatment. Further studies that take into account OSA comorbidities, cognitive profiles, a more diverse range of cognition assessments and include long-term evaluations are needed.",

However, the diagnostic criteria and exact prevalence of C-aerophagia are not well documented; therefore, this study aimed to evaluate them. METHODS: Newly developed criteria (flatulence, eructation, and abdominal bloating, with quantitative evaluation of these symptoms and a clear timing of onset) were used to diagnose C-aerophagia. The study included 753 adults with OSA who underwent follow-up visits for positive airway pressure treatment (including CPAP and bilevel positive airway pressure). The observation period ranged from 6 months to 3 years past the survey date (between May 1 and July 31, 2023). Medical records of patients were retrospectively analyzed. Discomfort associated with C-aerophagia was examined using a visual analog scale (VAS); a score ≥ 7 was associated with definite discomfort. Association of patient demographics and CPAP parameters with occurrence of C-aerophagia was analyzed using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of C-aerophagia was 7.2%. Although more than half of these patients reported discomfort associated with aerophagia, only 44.4% reported to their physician. The multivariate analysis showed that increased CPAP pressure level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24) and comorbid gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; OR = 2.52) promote C-aerophagia, while increased age (OR = 0.76) and body mass index (BMI; OR = 0.88) inhibit it. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of C-aerophagia was 7.2%. Most patients with C-aerophagia experience discomfort, but may not report these symptoms. High CPAP pressure and GERD promoted C-aerophagia, while aging and increased BMI prevented it.",

The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) on blood interleukin (IL) levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-17 in OSA adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The published databases from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from 2003 to 2024, without any restrictions. The Review Manager software 5.3 was employed to compute effect sizes, which were presented as the standardized mean difference (SMD) along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: In total, 320 records were identified through database searching; ultimately, 42 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis and then the meta-analysis. The CPAP therapy significantly reduces IL-6 levels, as indicated SMD=0.64 [95% CI: 0.35, 0.93] and P<0.0001. CPAP therapy significantly reduced IL-18 and IL-1β levels in adults with OSA, but there is no significant difference in IL-10, IL-4, or IL-17 levels. Age, blood sample, body mass index, ethnicity, and treatment duration for IL-6 and apnoea-hypopnea index with IL-10 levels were effective factors in the pooled results. Experimentally, there was an interaction between IL-18 and IL-1β. CONCLUSIONS: CPAP therapy has a positive impact on inflammatory markers in OSA adults; remarkably, it reduces IL-6 and IL-1β levels. Nevertheless, more evidence (such as the role of ethnicity) and understanding of interactions are needed.",

Unsatisfactory adherence to CPAP is an important clinical issue to resolve. Cluster analysis is a powerful tool to distinguish subgroups in a multidimensional fashion. This study aimed to investigate the use of cluster analysis for predicting CPAP adherence using clinical polysomnographic (PSG) parameters and patient characteristics. PATIENTS/METHODS: Participants of this multicenter observational study were 1133 patients with OSA who were newly diagnosed and implemented CPAP. Ward's method of cluster analysis was applied to in-laboratory diagnostic PSG parameters and patient characteristics. CPAP adherence was assessed during 90- and 365-day periods after CPAP initiation in each cluster. We adopted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services criterion for CPAP adherence, i.e., CPAP use ≥4 h per night for 70 % or more of the observation period. Logistic regression analysis was performed to stratify clusters according to CPAP adherence. RESULTS: Five clusters were identified through cluster analysis. Clustering was significantly associated with CPAP adherence at 90- and 365-day periods after CPAP initiation. Logistic regression revealed that the cluster with features including apnea predominant sleep-disordered breathing, high apnea-hypopnea index, and relatively older age demonstrated the highest CPAP adherence. CONCLUSION: Cluster analysis revealed hidden connections using patient characteristics and PSG parameters to successfully identify patients more likely to adhere to CPAP for 90 days and up to 365 days. When prescribing CPAP, it is possible to identify patients with OSA who are more likely to be non-adherent.",

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line and criterion standard treatment for OSA and is regarded as the most feasible choice during pregnancy. However, the association between CPAP therapy in pregnant women with OSA and reduced gestational complications remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between CPAP therapy in pregnant women with OSA and the reduction of adverse hypertensive outcomes during gestation. DATA SOURCES: Keyword searches of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Clinical Trials were conducted from inception to November 5, 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Original studies reporting the treatment effect of CPAP use on lowering hypertension and preeclampsia risks in pregnant women with OSA were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed in the reporting of reviews. Data were independently extracted by 2 authors. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed and risk ratios (RRs) reported. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression based on age and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and publication bias assessment were also conducted. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the RR of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia between pregnant women with OSA receiving CPAP treatment and those who did not receive CPAP treatment. RESULTS: Six original studies in 809 participants (mean age, 31.4 years; mean BMI, 34.0) were identified and systematically reviewed for meta-analysis. The pooled results showed significant differences between the intervention (CPAP use) and the control (non-CPAP use) groups in reducing the risk of gestational hypertension (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.89; P = .008) and preeclampsia (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98; P = .04). Meta-regression revealed that patients' age (coefficient, -0.0190; P = .83) and BMI (coefficient, -0.0042; P = .87) were not correlated with reduction of risk of hypertension and preeclampsia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that implementing CPAP treatment in pregnant women with OSA may reduce the risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.",

Objectives: This study investigated the impact of CPAP therapy termination in the first year on long sick leave leading to permanent work disability in patients with obstructive sleep apnea based on data from the Nationwide Claims Data Lake for Sleep Apnoea (ALASKA). Methods: French national health insurance reimbursement system data were analyzed for all adults with OSA aged ≤62 years who started CPAP therapy in France in 2015 and 2016. CPAP therapy termination was defined as the cessation of CPAP reimbursements triggered by the respiratory physician or sleep specialist in charge of follow-up. Individuals who terminated therapy were compared with those who continued to use CPAP. The primary outcome was sick leave ultimately leading to permanent work disability. A multivariable Fine and Gray model, adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, depression, and CPAP prescriber clinical specialty was used to assess the risk of long-term sick leave leading to permanent work disability over 3 years' follow-up. Results: The analysis included 174,270 individuals (median age, 52.0 yr [interquartile range, 44.0-57.0 yr]; 67.5% male). The 1-year CPAP therapy termination rate was 22.3%. The proportion of individuals with long-term sick leave leading to permanent work disability was significantly higher in the CPAP termination versus continuation group (0.60% vs. 0.52%; P = 0.042). In an adjusted multivariable Cox model, CPAP termination was associated with an increased risk of permanent work disability (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.41; P = 0.01), primarily in the subgroup aged >55 years (hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.06-1.87; P = 0.02). Conclusions: These real-world data from a comprehensive, unbiased database highlight the potential occupational impact of CPAP therapy termination.",

This study aimed to explore the impact of CPAP on cardiovascular outcomes and prognosis in patients with OSA. METHODS: A search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL databases for relevant studies published up to March 2024. Two independent reviewers screened the studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data were synthesised using RevMan 5.3 software. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and the I2 statistic. RESULTS: A total of 10 randomised controlled trials and 3 observational studies, comprising 13,832 patients, were included. Compared with standard treatment, the use of CPAP did not significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (risk ratio [RR]: 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-1.03; p = 0.07; I2 = 66%), all-cause mortality (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.72-1.16; p = 0.48; I2 = 0%), cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.33-1.19; p = 0.15; I2 = 70%) or non-cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.57-1.15; p = 0.23; I2 = 0%). Similarly, there were no significant differences in the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalisation due to unstable angina or heart failure or atrial fibrillation among those using CPAP. However, when CPAP adherence was ≥ 4 h, CPAP significantly reduced the risk of MACE and cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSION: Although CPAP's cardiovascular benefits in patients with OSA are not confirmed, it may be that bias risks, CPAP adherence and characteristics of the study population may attenuate the perceived benefits of CPAP.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To develop equations to predict therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAPT) based on home-based CPAP titration, including the type of interface used. METHOD: Retrospective study conducted in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who used home-based autoCPAP titration (AutoSet S10, ResMed®). CPAPT was obtained manually through a visual analysis of autoCPAP data (CPAPV) and automatically using the 95th percentile pressure (CPAPP95). Multiple linear regression and K-fold cross-validation were applied. Independent variables were AHI, neck circumference (NC), BMI, and mask. Two formulas were generated based on mask and the Miljeteig and Hoffstein formula. RESULTS: We included 702 patients (174 women), median age, BMI and AHI of 58 years, 32 kg/m2 and 32 ev/h, respectively. Predictors for CPAPv (M1) were BMI, NC, AHI and type of interface (R2: 0.19); and for CPAPP95 (M2), BMI, AHI and mask (R2: 0.09). Error and precision between the formulas and CPAPT were: 0 (CPAPV/CPAPP95), and - 3.2 to 3.2 (CPAPV) and - 4 to 4 cm H2O (CPAPP95). CPAPV was higher with oronasal mask (10 vs. 9 cm H2O, p < 0.01). Accuracy defined as; a difference ± 2 cm H2O between estimated CPAP and CPAPT was greater in M1 than in M2 (79% vs. 64%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In both models, calculated error was close to zero. CPAPV (± 3.2 cm H2O) showed more precision than CPAPP95 (± 4 cm H2O). With M1 (CPAPV), 79% of patients could start CPAP with reasonable accuracy (error of ± 2 cm H2O).",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The study was conducted to determine the effects of white noise during nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) application on the newborn's pain and stress levels, physiological parameters, and crying durations. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study used a randomized, controlled experimental design. The study was completed with 80 newborns (40 in the intervention group and 40 in the control group). The Newborn Descriptive Data Form, ALPS Newborn Pain and Stress Assessment Scale, and Follow-up Form were used to collect the study data. Routine nasal CPAP application was performed to newborns in the control group. White noise was played to newborns in the intervention group before, during, and after the nasal CPAP application. The study was approved by an ethics committee. RESULTS: It was found that the newborn's pain and stress levels of the intervention group were lower than the control group before, during, and after the nasal CPAP application (p < 0.05). Before nasal CPAP application, the intervention group's SpO2 average was lower than that of the control group (p < 0.01). During nasal CPAP application, the intervention group's heart rate, SpO2, and crying duration averages were found to be lower than the control group (p < 0.05). After nasal CPAP application, the intervention group's crying duration average was lower than the control group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It was found that white noise before, during, and after the nasal CPAP application reduced newborns' pain and stress levels. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: It is recommended that white noise be used as an easily applicable, economical, safe, and non-pharmacological method to reduce the pain and stress caused by nasal CPAP application in newborns. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: The study was registered at Clinical-Trials.gov (NCT05440669).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While new studies are being published on the prehospital continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) application in patients with respiratory failure with conflicting results, previous meta-analyses are showing the benefits of CPAP in the prehospital transfer of patients with respiratory distress. Before the clinical application of high-level evidence, updated pooled estimates are needed based on the growing literature. This study aimed to compare prehospital CPAP with the usual standard oxygen therapy of respiratory failure patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PRISMA guidelines served as the framework for this updated review study. It is an extension of a prior systematic review. We conducted comprehensive searches across several databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus, focusing on randomized trials that juxtaposed pre-hospital CPAP application against standard care. Our primary interest was to assess the in-hospital mortality risks, and we employed random effect models to aggregate risk ratios from the selected studies. RESULTS: Four articles were gathered based on the review of the updated literature (2013 to November 2022) in conjunction with the research incorporated in the preceding meta-analysis with a total number of 747 patients receiving prehospital CPAP with 101 events of in-hospital mortality. In the standard treatment control groups, there were 713 patients and 115 deaths occurred. Pooled mortality risk comparison between the group of prehospital CPAP and standard care patients had no statistically significant difference (P=0.16). There was no heterogenicity. A regression between the year of the studies and the effect size showed increased RR in new studies (P=0.017). CONCLUSION: Still more randomized trials are needed with higher sample sizes to conclude the lifesaving efficacy of the out-of-hospital CPAP."
