      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to understand how two respiratory strengthening protocols, therapeutic singing (TS) and expiratory muscle strength training (EMST), compare on measures of quality of life (QOL), depression and anxiety for persons with Parkinson's disease. An equally important aim was to understand participants' perceptions of both treatments. METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative datasets were integrated in a convergent mixed methods design within a randomized crossover intervention trial. Thirteen persons with mild-moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-3) completed both interventions, in random order, for 4 weeks, 5 days per week, for approximately 20 min per day. Participants completed self-report questionnaires (Geriatric Depression Scale, Parkinson's Anxiety Scale, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, and a Survey after Treatment) after each intervention, and twelve participants' qualitative data were analyzed. RESULTS: Quantitative data did not reveal significant differences between the interventions in depression on the Geriatric Depression Scale or anxiety on the Parkinson's Anxiety Scale and the qualitative data support those findings. There were no significant differences between interventions in QOL as measured by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, but there was a main effect of time, with a significant decline (p = 0.01) in perceived QOL between baseline and the final visit. The quantitative data diverged from the qualitative data as there were no themes that emerged to corroborate a decrease in QOL. Five qualitative themes were derived from thematic analysis: Benefits, Accessibility, Acceptability, Advice/Feedback, and Preference. Participants' perceptions of the interventions were closely aligned to individual differences and preferences, with an equal split of participants preferring TS and EMST. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this mixed methods comparison of two respiratory interventions will help to improve the acceptability and accessibility of the interventions to better facilitate adherence to the interventions and promote continued engagement, thereby delaying respiratory decline in those with PD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With longer life spans and medical advancements, the rising number of patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) warrants attention. Current literature predominantly addresses dementia and fall management in these patients. However, exploring the impact of swallowing function on patients with advanced PD is crucial. Previous research has demonstrated notable enhancements in the quality of life related to voice for participants following a group singing-intervention program. To further elucidate the effect of individual singing-induced swallowing exercises, our study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative effects of therapeutic singing on swallowing function in patients with advanced PD in comparison to a matched usual care control group. The hypothesis of this study is that therapeutic singing-induced swallowing exercises can assist to maintain swallowing function in patients with advanced PD. METHODS: This prospective matched control study compared the effects of a 6-week therapeutic singing-based swallowing intervention on swallowing function and quality of life in patients with advanced PD. The intervention group received individual sessions with a music therapist and conventional individual physical therapy. The control group received the same standard physical therapy for 6 weeks without music intervention. The primary outcome measure was Video Fluoroscopic Dysphagia Scale (VDS). RESULTS: The study revealed that the intervention group maintained swallowing function, whereas the control group experienced deterioration, indicating significant time-dependent changes in Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS), National Institutes of Health-Swallowing Safety Scale (NIH-SSS), and VDS. Analysis of PAS and NIH-SSS liquid food scores in both groups showed significant time effects. However, the intervention group exhibited no significant differences between the pre- and post-tests, indicating preservation of the swallowing function. VDS of liquid food indicated an interaction effect between time and group in the pharyngeal phase and total scores. The Swallowing-Quality of Life showed significant time-effect improvement in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic singing exercises may help maintain swallowing function in advanced PD patients, potentially enhancing quality of life related to swallowing in those with advanced-stage diseases.

      "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience speech and voice-related symptoms that diminish communication and quality of life. Semi-occluded vocal tract (SOVT) exercises are targeted interventions that, when combined with the positive psychosocial benefits of therapeutic group singing (TGS), may affect outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of SOVT exercises, specifically straw phonation combined with TGS, to improve voice quality and mood for individuals with PD. We used a true experimental pretest-posttest between-subjects design (i.e., randomized controlled trial) facilitated by a board-certified music therapist. All participants (N = 27) were randomly assigned to one of three groups (a) straw phonation combined with TGS (SP + TGS, n = 10), (b) TGS (n = 10), and (c) speaking-only control group (n = 7). Participants completed voice recordings for acoustic measures and the Visual Analogue Mood Scale for mood analysis before and after a 30-min intervention. The results demonstrated significant improvement in voice quality evidenced by decreasing Acoustic Voice Quality Index scores following a single session for both SP + TGS and TGS intervention groups when compared to the control. Happiness scores improved in the experimental groups when compared to control. Although not statistically significant, participants in the experimental groups (SP + TGS, TGS) demonstrated better mean mood scores on happiness, anxiety, and angry when compared to control, indicating a positive psychological response to the singing interventions. Overall, this study indicated the effectiveness of SP + TGS and TGS as promising therapeutic interventions for voice quality and mood in individuals with PD.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a single session of GTS on clinical motor symptoms. METHODS: Clinical motor symptom assessment was completed immediately before and after 1 hour of GTS in 18 participants. RESULTS: A significant decrease in average scores for gait and posture and tremor, but not speech and facial expression or bradykinesia was revealed. CONCLUSION: These results support the notion that GTS is a beneficial adjuvant therapy for persons with PD that warrants further research."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer patients often suffer from dysphagia after surgery and radiotherapy. A singing-enhanced swallowing protocol was established to improve their swallowing function. This study aimed to evaluate the beneficial effects of therapeutic singing on dysphagia in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. METHODS: Patients who participated in this study were allocated to the intervention group (15 patients) and the control group (13 patients). Patients assigned to the intervention group received therapeutic singing 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups, including the oral cavity cancer group and the pharyngeal cancer group. The patients' vocal functions were evaluated in maximum phonation time, pitch, intensity, jitter, shimmer, harmonics to noise ratio, and laryngeal diadochokinesis (L-DDK). To evaluate swallowing function, videofluoroscopic swallowing study was done, and the results were analyzed by videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale (VDS) and dynamic imaging grade of swallowing toxicity (DIGEST). RESULTS: Among the voice parameters, L-DDK of the intervention group significantly increased compared to that of the control group. Swallowing functions of the intervention group were significantly improved in VDS and DIGEST after the intervention. Detailed items of VDS and DIGEST showed improvements especially in the pharyngeal phase score of VDS, such as laryngeal elevation, pharyngeal transit time, and aspiration. In addition, the pharyngeal cancer group showed significant improvements in VDS and DIGEST scores after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our outcomes highlight the beneficial effects of singing for HNC patients with dysphagia. The notable improvements in the pharyngeal phase suggest that therapeutic singing would be more appropriate for HNC patients who need to improve their intrinsic muscle movements of vocal fold and laryngeal elevation.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of music into the treatment plan for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) may be a viable strategy to target multiple motor symptoms. However, potential mechanisms to explain why music has an impact on multiple motor symptoms in persons with PD remain understudied. The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of 1 h of group therapeutic singing (GTS) on physiological measures of stress and clinical motor symptoms in persons with PD. We posit that improvement in motor symptoms after GTS may be related to stress reduction. Seventeen participants with PD completed 1 h of GTS and eight participants completed 1 h of a quiet reading (control session). Cortisol was collected via passive drool immediately before and after the singing and control session. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part-III (motor examination) was also video-recorded immediately before and after the singing and control session and scored by two raters masked to time and condition. Secondary outcome measures for quality of life, depression, and mood were collected. Results revealed no significant change in cortisol or motor UPDRS scores, as well as no significant relationship between cortisol and motor UPDRS scores. There was a trend for the singing group to report feeling less sad compared to the control group after the 1-h session (effect size = 0.86), and heart rate increased in the singing group while heart rate decreased in the control group after the 1-h session. These results suggest that an acute session of GTS is not unduly stressful and promotes the use of GTS for persons with PD. Multiple mechanisms may underlie the benefits of GTS for persons with PD. Further exploring potential mechanisms by which singing improves motor symptoms in persons with PD will provide greater insight on the therapeutic use of music for persons with PD."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of therapeutic singing as an intervention for improving the vocal functions of the elderly. Data collection for this study took place at five senior community centers in Seoul, South Korea, from August 2018 to March 2019. A total of 54 elderly with healthy voices were assigned to a therapeutic singing group, a general singing group, or a control group, using convenience sampling. The therapeutic singing intervention involved using the Alexander technique, performing oral motor and respiratory exercises, and singing participant-written songs, across 12 sessions. The general singing group sang popular and folk songs of their choice. The control group received no treatment. Using peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) and Praat analysis, the participants' vocal functions were measured before and immediately after the intervention. Vocal function was compared among the groups pre- and post-test; the therapeutic singing group showed statistically significant improvement in all vocal parameters: PEF, maximum phonation time, voice intensity (intensity), fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer, and noise-to harmonics ratio. The general singing group showed improvement only in F0, jitter, and noise-to harmonics ratio. The control group showed an overall reduction in all vocal functions, with a significant decrease in PEF and intensity, and a decrease in jitter and shimmer. Although singing is considered helpful for the voice health of the elderly, therapeutic singing, which involves posture correction and breathing exercises, is even more effective, thus proving to be a viable intervention for preventive voice care of the elderly.",

However, it remains unknown if GTS can be effectively delivered through telemedicine. Methods: Participants with PD from rural areas were recruited to complete a prerecorded GTS program, once a week for 8 weeks. Voice and respiratory outcome measures were collected 1 week before and 1 week after intervention. Results: Ten participants were enrolled in the study. One participant dropped at week 3. Five participants attended all eight sessions, two participants completed seven sessions, and one participant completed six sessions for 93.75% compliance. Statistical analysis for the data collected from the eight participants enrolled in the study revealed that voice outcome measures improved but did not reach significance. However, respiratory outcome measures significantly improved. Discussion: Results suggest that prerecorded GTS is feasible. Moreover, results are in keeping with results from a previous study using the exact same intervention with an in person therapist. Thus, this pilot work suggests that the use of prerecorded GTS may be a viable treatment option for those with limited access to care.",

Singing involves the use of similar muscles and the neural networks associated with vocal function and emotional response. The purpose of this study is to enhance vocal quality and depressive symptoms of patients with PD using individual singing program. METHODS: The Individual Therapeutic Singing Program for PD (ITSP-PD) was conducted by a certified music therapist. In total, nine PD patients with a subjective voice problem or depression participated in 6 sessions over 2 weeks. We measured the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) via the Praat test, the Voice Handicap Index (VHI), the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). RESULTS: In total, 8 out of 9 patients completed all the sessions; 6 out of 8 patients participated in the follow-up test after 6 months. A statistically significant change in MPT (p = 0.011) was observed between the pre- and post-tests. The VHI (p = 0.035) and the GDS (p = 0.018) were significantly lower in the post-test. In the pre-, post-, and follow-up tests, the MPT (p = 0.030), V-RQOL (p = 0.008), and GDS (p = 0.009) were significantly changed. CONCLUSION: The ITSP-PD based on neurological singing therapy for PD showed therapeutic possibility for vocal function and depression in patients with PD. Our findings suggest the need for a randomized study to examine the continuing positive effects of the ITSP-PD over a longer period of time."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to altered neural control of movement, including the control of voice, respiration, and swallowing. There is a prevalent need to provide therapy for voice, respiration, and swallowing difficulties because current pharmacological and surgical treatments do not effectively treat these impairments. Previous research has demonstrated that singing may be a treatment option to target voice, respiratory, and swallowing impairments, as well as quality of life. However, participants' perspectives related to reasons for enrolling and engaging in programs as well as evaluation of singing programs have been neglected. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this descriptive study was thus to solicit participants' views of their involvement in a group singing intervention (GSI) led by credentialed music therapists. METHODS: Twenty persons with PD were interviewed 4 to 6 months after completing the singing intervention. Participants were asked about 1) why they chose to participate, 2) what were the beneficial and non-beneficial aspects of participating, and 3) how to improve overall design and delivery of the GSI. RESULTS: Using content analysis procedures, we learned that participants regarded their involvement in the study as mutually beneficial, fun, and engaging. Participants appreciated the fellowship with other persons with PD and offered minimal constructive criticism. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided greater insight into how a therapeutic singing program may benefit participants and positively impact their lives.",

There is a present need for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving swallow function during the early stages of PD. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effects of a group therapeutic singing intervention on swallowing in persons with PD with no significant dysphagia symptoms. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: University in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four participants with PD. INTERVENTION: Eight weeks of group therapeutic singing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Electromyography (EMG) was used to assess muscle activity associated with swallow pre and post the group singing intervention. Swallow quality of life (SWAL-QOL) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were also obtained pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Participants reported minimal difficulty with swallowing, yet results revealed a significant increase in EMG outcome measures, as well as significant improvement in UPDRS total and UPDRS motor scores. No significant differences were revealed for SWAL-QOL. CONCLUSION: Increases in EMG timing measures may suggest that group singing results in the prolongation of laryngeal elevation, protecting the airway from foreign material for longer periods of time during swallow. Combined with the improvement in UPDRS clinical measures, therapeutic singing may be an engaging early intervention strategy to address oropharyngeal dysphagia while also benefiting additional clinical symptoms of PD.",
