      "abstract": "Despite a multitude of investigations assessing the impact of green coffee extract supplementation on obesity indices, there is still a great deal of heated debate regarding the benefits of this intervention in obesity management. Therefore, in order to clarify the effect of green coffee extract on waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and body weight (BW), we conducted an umbrella review of interventional meta-analyses. The Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/Medline, and Embase databases were searched using specific keywords and word combinations. The umbrella meta-analysis was performed using the Stata software version 17 (Stata Corp. College Station, Texas, USA). We pooled effect sizes (ES) and confidence intervals (CI) for the outcomes using the random effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method). In total, 5 eligible meta-analyses were included in the final quantitative assessment. Data pooled from 5 eligible papers revealed that green coffee extract can reduce BW (WMD: -1.22 kg, 95% CI: -1.53 to -0.92, p < 0.001), BMI (WMD: -0.48 kg/m2, 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.29, p < 0.001) and WC (WMD: -0.55 cm, 95% CI: -0.80 to -0.31, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses highlighted that green coffee extract supplementation in dosages ≤600 mg/day and interventions lasting >7 wk are more likely to decrease BW. The present umbrella meta-analysis confirms the beneficial effects of green coffee extract in reducing WC, BMI, and BW. Thus, we may infer that green coffee extract can be used as a complementary therapy in the management of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Due to the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, a strategy that can positively influence diet quality in a simple way is being explored, since a low glycemic index (GI) diet is advised in the dietoprophylaxis and diet therapy of diabetes. Methods: Twenty-three women with abdominal obesity participated in the study. The postprandial glycemic response and glycemic index were determined after three carbohydrate meals (noodle soup, white rice, strawberry sorbet) without or with the addition of a plant-base supplement (extracts of kidney bean, white mulberry leaf, and green coffee) with a potentially hypoglycemic effect. For two products (instant noodle soup and white rice), the addition of the plant supplement resulted in a reduction in glicemic iAUC values (respectively, by: 17.1%, p = 0.005 and 5.3%; p = 0.03; 40.6%, p = 0.004 and 5.3%, p = 0.019). However, this effect was not observed for strawberry sorbet. The blood glucose concentrations 30 min after the consumption of instant noodle soup and white rice with the plant-based formula addition significantly affected the GI value of tested meals (p = 0.0086, r = 0.53; p = 0.0096, r = 0.53), which may indicate the effect of this plant supplement on enterohormone and/or insulin secretion. Conclusion: A formula containing kidney bean, white mulberry leaves, and green coffee extracts may therefore be a notable factor in lowering postprandial glycemia and the GI of carbohydrate foods. However, further research is needed to determine for which food groups and meals its use may be most effective.",

Method: A total of 44 breast cancer survivors with obesity aged between 18 and 70 years and with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 31.62 ± 4.97 kg m-2 participated in this double-blind randomized clinical trial. Eligible patients were randomized to the intervention (n = 22) and control (n = 22) groups. They received two 400 mg capsules of DGCE or two identical placebos daily for 12 weeks. Serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, NPY, fasting blood sugar, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured at the baseline and after completion of the intervention. Also, weight, waist circumference, fat percentage, muscle percentage, and visceral fat were measured. Results: There were no significant differences in terms of changes of anthropometric indices and concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, NPY, and blood sugar between the two studied groups. Conclusion: Supplementation with DGCE in breast cancer survivors with obesity had no significant effect on anthropometric indices and blood glucose, leptin, adiponectin, and NPY levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The immune system functions to protect the host from a broad array of infectious diseases. Here, we evaluated the in vitro immunomodulatory effects of green coffee extract (GCE), and conducted a double-blinded, randomized and placebo-controlled trial among apparently healthy individuals. METHODS: We determined the levels and functions of inflammatory and immune markers viz., phospho-NF-κB p65 ser536, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, TH1/TH2 cytokines and IgG production. We also evaluated several immunological markers such as total leukocyte counts, differential leukocyte counts, NK cell activity, CD4/CD8 ratio, serum immunoglobulin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: GCE significantly inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB p65 ser536 phosphorylation, MCP-1-induced chemotaxis and significantly enhanced phagocytosis and IgG production. In addition, GCE modulated PMA/PHA-induced TH1/TH2 cytokine production. Clinical investigations suggested that the expression of CD56 and CD16 was markedly augmented on NK cells following GCE treatment. GCE significantly enhanced IgA production before and after influenza vaccination. Similarly, IL-6, TNF-α and CRP levels were significantly inhibited by GCE. Together, GCE confers several salubrious immunomodulatory effects at different levels attributing to optimal functioning of immune responses in the host.

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse association between coffee consumption and the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). The effects of the oral treatment with green (non-roasted) coffee extracts (CE, 100 or 400 mg/kg) and caffeine (31.2 mg/kg) were evaluated on catalepsy induced by haloperidol in mice, and unilateral 6-OHDA lesion of medial forebrain bundle (MFB) or striatum in rats. Also, the in vitro antioxidant activity and the monoamine levels in the striatum were investigated. CE presented a mild antioxidant activity in vitro and its administration decreased the catalepsy index. CE at the dose of 400 mg/kg induced ipsilateral rotations 14 days after lesion; however, chronic 30-day CE and caffeine treatments did not interfere with the animals' rotation after apomorphine or methamphetamine challenges in animals with MFB lesion, nor on monoamines levels. Furthermore, CE and caffeine were effective in inhibiting the asymmetry between ipsilateral and contralateral rotations induced by methamphetamine and apomorphine in animals with lesion in the striatum but did not avoid the monoamines depletion. These results indicate that CE components indirectly modulate dopaminergic transmission, suggesting a pro-dopaminergic action of CE, and further investigation must be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of action and the possible neuroprotective role in PD.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a highly prevalent condition without specific pharmacological treatment, characterized in the initial stages by hepatic steatosis. It was suggested that lipid infiltration in the liver might be reduced by caffeine through anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and fatty acid metabolism-related mechanisms. We investigated the effects of caffeine (CAF) and green coffee extract (GCE) on hepatic lipids in lean female rats with steatosis. For three months, female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a standard diet or a cocoa butter-based high-fat diet plus 10% liquid fructose. In the last month, the high-fat diet was supplemented or not with CAF or a GCE, providing 5 mg/kg of CAF. Plasma lipid levels and the hepatic expression of molecules involved in lipid metabolism were determined. Lipidomic analysis was performed in liver samples. The diet caused hepatic steatosis without obesity, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or hepatic insulin resistance. Neither CAF nor GCE alleviated hepatic steatosis, but GCE-treated rats showed lower hepatic triglyceride levels compared to the CAF group. The GCE effects could be related to reductions of hepatic (i) mTOR phosphorylation, leading to higher nuclear lipin-1 levels and limiting lipogenic gene expression; (ii) diacylglycerol levels; (iii) hexosylceramide/ceramide ratios; and (iv) very-low-density lipoprotein receptor expression. In conclusion, a low dose of CAF did not reduce hepatic steatosis in lean female rats, but the same dose provided as a green coffee extract led to lower liver triglyceride levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of coffee consumption in the risk of cardiovascular diseases has been debated for many years. The current study aimed to summarize earlier evidence on the effects of green coffee extract (GCE) supplementation on glycemic indices and lipid profile. METHODS: We searched available online databases for relevant clinical trials published up to October 2019. All clinical trials investigating the effect of GCE supplementation, compared with a control group, on fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were included. Overall, 14 clinical trials with a total sample size of 766 participants were included in the current meta-analysis. RESULTS: We found a significant reducing effect of GCE supplementation on FBG (weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.35, 95% CI: - 3.78, - 0.92 mg/dL, P = 0.001) and serum insulin (WMD: -0.63, 95% CI: - 1.11, - 0.15 μU/L, P = 0.01). With regard to lipid profile, we observed a significant reduction only in serum levels of TC following GCE supplementation in the overall meta-analysis (WMD: -4.51, 95% CI: - 8.39, - 0.64, P = 0.02). However, subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in serum TG in studies enrolled both genders. Also, such a significant reduction was seen in serum levels of LDL and HDL when the analyses confined to studies with intervention duration of ≥8 weeks and those included female subjects. In the non-linear dose-response analyses, we found that the effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA) dosage, the main polyphenol in GCE, on FBG, TG and HDL were in the non-linear fashions. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that GCE supplementation improved FBG and serum levels of insulin and TC. Also, there was a significant improvement in other markers of lipid profile in some subgroups of clinical trials.",

However, the accuracy of those meta-analyses is uncertain due to several methodological limitations. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to summarize all available evidence on the effects of GCE supplementation on anthropometric measures by considering the main limitations in the previous meta-analyses. METHODS: We searched available online databases for relevant publications up to January 2020, using relevant keywords. All randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of GCE supplementation, compared with a control group, on anthropometric measures [including body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)] were included. RESULTS: After identifying 1871 studies from our initial search, 15 RCTs with a total sample size of 897 participants were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. We found a significant reducing effect of GCE supplementation on body weight (weighted mean difference (WMD): -1.23, 95 % CI: -1.64, -0.82 kg,P < 0.001), BMI (WMD: -0.48, 95 % CI: -0.78, -0.18 kg/m2, P = 0.001), and WC (WMD: -1.00, 95 % CI: -1.70, -0.29 cm, P = 0.006). No significant effect of GCE supplementation on body fat percentage and WHR was seen. In the dose-response analyses, there was no significant association between chlorogenic acid (CGA) dosage, as the main polyphenol in green coffee, and changes in anthropometric measures. CONCLUSION: We found that GCE supplementation had a beneficial effect on body weight, BMI and WC. It provides a cost-effective and safe alternative for the treatment of obesity.

INTERVENTIONS: The study subjects were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 400 mg GCE (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for eight weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum liver enzyme levels, lipid profile, adiponectin concentrations, and hepatic steatosis grade were measured for all patients at baseline and the end of the trial. RESULTS: GCE supplementation significantly reduced BMI [mean difference (MD): -0.57 and 95 % confidence interval (CI): -0.84 to -0.29, P < 0.001] and increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: 7.06, 95 % CI: 0.25-13.87, P < 0.05) compared to the control group. Serum total cholesterol decreased significantly within the GCE group (MD: -13.33, 95 % CI: -26.04 to -0.61, P < 0.05). Triglyceride levels reduced significantly in GCE group compared to the placebo group (MD: -37.91; 95 % CI: -72.03 to -3.80; P = 0.03). However, this reduction was not significant when was further adjusted for mean changes in BMI and daily energy intake (MD: -23.43; 95 % CI: -70.92 to 24.06; P = 0.32). Hepatic steatosis grade, liver enzymes, and adiponectin levels did not show significant differences between the two groups after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: GCE supplementation improved serum lipid profile and BMI in individuals with NAFLD. GCE may be useful in controlling NAFLD risk factors.",

The literature search was performed in four databases, namely, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, to identify clinical trials that examined the effects of green coffee supplements on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) up to February 2019. Mean change and standard deviation (SD) of the outcome measures were used to estimate the mean difference between the intervention group and the control group at follow-up. Nine studies reported SBP and DBP as an outcome measure. Results revealed significant reduction in SBP (weighted mean difference: -3.093 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.914, -2.273; I2 = 0.0%) and DBP (-2.170 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.749, -1.590; I2 = 46.5%) after green coffee supplementation with low heterogeneity among the studies. In addition, in subgroup analysis, a significant reduction in SBP and DBP in studies with hypertensive patients, green coffee dosage <400 mg, and administered for 4 weeks was identified. The results of the current meta-analysis study support the use of GCBE supplementation for the improvement of blood pressure indices, with subgroup analysis highlighting improvements in hypertensive patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given that the most recent systematic review investigating Green-Coffee Extract (GCE) as a weight loss facilitator was nearly a decade ago and that the authors reported there no consensus on the effect of GCE/CGA (Chlorogenic acids) on body composition indices, a comprehensive systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of all available randomized controlled trial (RCTs) was undertaken to examine the effect of GCE and CGA intervention on body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in adults. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed up to June 2019 in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar. RCTs that investigated the effect GCE/CGA Supplementation on BW, BMI and WC in adults were included for final analysis. The pooled weight mean difference (WMD) of included studies was estimated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles with 16 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Results revealed significant reduction in BMI (WMD: -0.403 kg/m2, 95% CI: -0.800, -0.005, p = 0.047) and no significant change in BW (WMD: -0.585 kg, 95% CI: -1.498, 0.329, p = 0.210) and WC (WMD: -0.847 cm, 95% CI: -1.764, 0.071, p = 0.070). In the subgroup analysis, studies that were conducted on baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2 revealed a significant greater reduction in body weight and BMI than those performed on baseline BMI <25 kg/m2. Moreover, short supplementation periods of less than 4 weeks had no effect. CONCLUSION: The results of current meta-analysis study support the use of GCE supplementation for the improvement of obesity indices, with sub-group analysis highlighting greater improvements in individuals with a starting BMI ≥25 kg/m2.",

Subjects were randomly allocated to consume 400 mg GCE or placebo capsules twice per d for 8 weeks. Both groups were advised to follow an energy balanced diet. After GCE supplementation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly reduced compared with the placebo group (-13·76 (sd 8·48) v. -6·56 (sd 9·58) mmHg, P=0·01). Also, GCE treatment significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBS) (-5·15 (sd 60·22) v. 29·42 (sd 40·01) mg/dl (-0·28 (SD 3·34) v. 1·63 (SD 2·22) mmol/l); P=0·03) and homoeostatic model of assessment of insulin resistance in comparison to placebo (-1·41 (sd 3·33) v. 1·23 (sd 3·84), P=0·02). In addition, waist circumference (-2·40 (sd 2·54) v. -0·66 (sd 1·17) cm, P=0·009) and appetite score (-1·44 (sd 1·72) v. -0·2 (sd 1·32), P=0·01) of the individuals supplemented with GCE indicated a significant decline. Besides, weight and BMI reduction in the intervention group was almost twice as much as the placebo group; however, this discrepancy was marginally significant (weight: -2·08 (sd 2·11) v. -0·92 (sd 1·30) kg, P=0·05). No difference was observed in terms of glycated Hb (HbA1c) percentage and lipid profile parameters between the two groups. To sum up, GCE administration had an ameliorating effect on some of the Mets components such as high SBP, high FBS and Mets main aetiological factors including insulin resistance and abdominal obesity. Furthermore, GCE supplementation could reduce appetite level.",

      "abstract": "Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are cinnamic acid derivatives with biological effects mostly related to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQA) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (diCQA) are the main CGA found in nature. Because green coffee is a major source of CGA, it has been used for production of nutraceuticals. However, data on the bioavailability of CGA from green coffee in humans are inexistent. The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile and apparent bioavailability of CGA in plasma and urine of 10 healthy adults for 8 h after the consumption of a decaffeinated green coffee extract containing 170 mg of CGA. Three CQA, 3 diCQA, and caffeic, ferulic, isoferulic, and p-coumaric acids were identified in plasma by HPLC-Diode Array Detector-MS after treatment. Over 30% (33.1 +/- 23.1%) of the ingested cinnamic acid moieties were recovered in plasma, including metabolites, with peak levels from 0.5 to 8 h after treatment. CGA and metabolites identified in urine after treatment were 4-CQA, 5-CQA, and sinapic, p-hydroxybenzoic, gallic, vanillic, dihydrocaffeic, caffeic, ferulic, isoferulic, and p-coumaric acids, totaling 5.5 +/- 10.6% urinary recovery of the ingested cinnamic and quinic acid moiteties. This study shows that the major CGA compounds present in green coffee are highly absorbed and metabolized in humans.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that bread supplemented with functional ingredients was more chemoprotective than nonsupplemented bread. Here we investigated components of a German wheat bread supplemented with green coffee antioxidants (GC) to assess basic biological activities in human cells in culture. We analyzed chlorogenic acid (ChA) in the bread and determined antioxidative activities. Human colon (HT29) and liver (HepG2) cells were incubated with GC and with aqueous extracts of freeze-dried breads, after which cell survival (4' ,6-diamino-2- phenylindole dihydrochloride assay) and H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage (comet assay) were determined. GC and supplemented bread contained 7- and 880-fold more ChA than normal bread and were significantly more antioxidative (ferric reducing ability of plasma assay, 2.9- and 265-fold; Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay, 1.3- and 24-fold, respectively). Treatment of cells for 24 to 72 h with the samples resulted in a significant inhibition of cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. HepG2 liver cells were more susceptible than HT29 colon cells. No genotoxicity or cytotoxicity was observed after treatment of cells with GC, ChA, or the bread samples. H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage was reduced significantly after treatment with GC, ChA, and supplemented bread. In conclusion, the supplementation of bread with GC improves the chemoprotective property of normal bread under these in vitro cell culture conditions. Supplementation also increases ChA content and antioxidative capacity. The treatment of the cells with supplemented bread increases resistance of colon and liver cells against H(2)O(2), a source of oxidative stress.",
