      "abstract": "Microplastics originate from the fragmentation of large plastic litter or environmental emissions. These new emerging pollutants not only cause physical harm but also serve as a substrate for other contaminants that adhere to and/or are adsorbed in microplastics. Consumption of these fine particles by organisms may lead to bioaccumulation and bioamplification. Conventional wastewater treatment using inorganic and organic polymeric flocculants is nonbiodegradable and toxic to ecosystem. Plant-derived polysaccharides can provide a highly efficient, nontoxic, and ecofriendly substitute to synthetic flocculants. The microplastic removal efficiency of polysaccharides derived from fenugreek, okra, and the combination of okra and fenugreek in the ratio of 1:1 was studied in simulated and water samples collected from various sources under bench-scale laboratory conditions. Water samples used for the study were collected from surface, ocean, and groundwater sources. A combination of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to study the microplastic removal efficiency of the plant-derived polysaccharides. ζ-Potential measurements and scanning electron microscopy were used to confirm the mechanism and capture of microplastic from water samples. The effect of varying polymer concentrations and contact time was also studied. The best concentration was found to be 1 g/L, with fenugreek showing the best microplastic removal in 30-60 min as the optimum contact time. It was found that fenugreek was the most efficient with an ∼89% microplastic removal from groundwater samples. A combination of okra and fenugreek was the most efficient for freshwater samples with an ∼77% microplastic removal. For the ocean water, okra showed the best removal efficiency of ∼80%. The mechanism of microplastic removal using plant-based polysaccharides as flocculant was found to be bridging. Both experimental and statistical analyses demonstrated that plant-based polysaccharides showed better microplastic removal efficiency than polyacrylamide, which is commercially used for water treatment."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating the development of effective preventive strategies. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) possesses well-documented pharmacological properties; however, its chemopreventive potential in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unexplored. This study evaluates the efficacy of methanolic fenugreek seed extract (FSE) in an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced murine colorectal cancer (CRC) model, focusing on the modulation of oxidative stress, regulation of biomarkers, induction of apoptosis, and maintenance of epithelial integrity. Methods: FSE was extracted using cold maceration (yield: 24%) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), identifying 13 bioactive compounds, including benzene, 1,3-dimethyl-; 1,3-cyclopentadiene, 5-(1-methylethylidene)-; o-Xylene; benzenepropanoic acid, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-; and benzene, 1,2,3-trimethyl-. All 13 compounds identified were matched with the NIST library with high confidence. Molecular docking was used to assess the interactions of FSE bioactives with E-cadherin-β-catenin complexes. Swiss albino mice received an FSE pre-treatment before AOM induction and continued this treatment three times weekly for 21 weeks. Key assessments included survival analysis, body weight changes, serum biomarker levels (GGT, 5'-NT, LDH), antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx1, MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantification, apoptosis detection via flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence-based evaluation of E-cadherin dynamics. Results: FSE improved survival rates, mitigated AOM-induced weight loss, and dose-dependently reduced serum biomarker levels. Antioxidant enzyme activity was restored, while MDA levels declined. A dose-dependent increase in ROS facilitated apoptosis, as confirmed by flow cytometry (16.7% in the low-dose FSE group and 34.5% in the high-dose FSE group). Immunofluorescence studies revealed that FSE-mediated restoration of E-cadherin localization counteracted AOM-induced epithelial disruptions. Conclusions: FSE exhibits potent chemopreventive potential against CRC by modulating oxidative stress, regulating key biomarkers, inducing apoptosis, and restoring epithelial integrity. These findings support further investigations into its clinical relevance for CRC prevention."

      "abstract": "Fenugreek water, with its natural brilliance and dual magic, shines as a green catalyst for health and beauty. From managing diabetes to rejuvenating skin, discover the science behind this age-old remedy turned modern marvel that shows more detail study on fenugreek water. This study investigates the structural and optical properties of fenugreek water, examining its interactions with sugar solutions, anti-diabetes medications (Diapride M2 Forte), and sunscreen cream (shadow SPF50 + cream) over a period of 3 days. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of soaking fenugreek seed powder in water shows the peak intensity increased significantly from day 1 to day 3 because gel-like mucilage forms. The fenugreek seed powder exhibited broader peaks compared to the more crystalline diabetes medications, reflecting a less organized polysaccharide structure. The optical studies of fenugreek water mixed with sugar solutions (125 mg/dl, 155 mg/dl, and 185 mg/dl) showed that absorbance decreased as sugar concentration increased but increased with higher volumes of fenugreek water, revealing colloidal interactions. On day 1, the absorbance peak was around 250 nm, but days 2 and 3 introduced additional peaks at 350 nm, indicating evolving colloidal particle sizes. When mixed with anti-diabetes drugs, fenugreek water exhibited increased absorbance on day 3, suggesting enhanced interaction. Additionally, fenugreek water showed significant effects on sunscreen cream, with increased absorbance indicating improved UV protection. FTIR analysis revealed that prolonged soaking increases the colloidal formation and bioactive compound concentration, enhancing the health benefits of fenugreek water. The pH of fenugreek water remained relatively stable between  8-9 throughout the study, suggesting minimal impact on the overall effectiveness of the interactions. The findings suggest that fenugreek water plays a crucial role in green catalytic properties that have the potential to reduce diabetes levels and its promising role in enhancing the efficacy of sunscreen creams for skincare treatment, demonstrating the most effective properties for both applications. Also, the study evaluates the UV-blocking and antioxidant properties of fenugreek water, demonstrating its potential as a natural sunscreen additive and free radical scavenger. The observation shows that fenugreek water enhances UV absorption when combined with cream and exhibits peak antioxidant activity on day 2, making it suitable for skincare and pharmaceutical applications.",

Fenugreek seeds possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, making them valuable therapeutic agents in managing neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the primary biological pathways and specific mechanisms underlying the protective effects of fenugreek in preventing mice of AD by employing bioinformatics and experimental verification. METHODS: We administered fenugreek extract as an intervention in mice model of AD and then assessed their cognitive ability and histopathological changes. We predicted the key target genes associated with fenugreek action on AD and the main biological pathways using the bioinformatics method. Furthermore, we observed the different expression of target genes by western blot (WB). RESULTS: The bioinformatics analysis revealed a strong correlation between fenugreek and AD. The behavioral experiments confirmed that fenugreek improved the behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in mice with AD. The histopathology revealed significant changes that fenugreek can inhabit Nissl bodies. Western blot experiments confirmed that fenugreek exerted statistically significant modulatory effects on the levels of inflammatory proteins [interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-1β] and oxidative stress-related proteins (amyloid-β protein precursor, apolipoprotein E, and presenilin 1). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that fenugreek might be involved in the AD pathway and effectively prevented the progression of AD through significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."

The development of new drugs is crucial, and research on plant substances with biological activities against cancer is actively underway. This study explored the potential use of fenugreek seed extract (FSE) in pancreatic cancer treatment as the anticancer activity of FSE is still poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anticancer activity of FSE on pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated using cell viability and apoptosis assays. The migration rate of cancer cells was quantified using wound healing and Transwell migration assays. Western blotting was utilized to assess relevant signaling pathways, and LC-MS/MS was employed to detect the active compounds in FSE. RESULTS: FSE inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1, Miapaca-2, SNU-213, and Aspc-1) in a time and dose-dependent manner without greatly affecting normal cells (293T). The inhibition of cancer cell proliferation was attributed to the activation of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, a pro-apoptotic marker. The anticancer effects and inhibition of cell migration were mediated by the MAPK, Akt, MMP-9, and vimentin signaling pathways through inactivation of the phosphorylated proteins related to cell growth, differentiation, and migration. LC-MS/MS analysis detected various active compounds capable of inducing apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that FSE has anticancer properties by inducing apoptosis and preventing metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells without affecting normal cells."

      "abstract": "Objective: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent local dilation of the abdominal aorta developed by chronic local inflammation and elastin degradation. Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that fenugreek supplementation can inhibit AAA growth. Materials and methods: AAA was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by intraluminal porcine pancreatic elastase infusion. The treatment by oral gavage was initiated post-operatively on day 1 and was administered daily (750 mg/kg/daily or 1500 mg/kg/daily or distilled water) for 27 days. AAA expansion was monitored weekly by ultrasound measurements in a blinded-to-treatment fashion; rats were euthanized 28 days after surgery. AAA cross-sections were examined histologically, where treatment allocation were blinded. Results: AAA developed in all three groups, yet there was no measured difference (p=0.104) in the maximal inner anterior-posterior abdominal aortic diameter on day 28 post-surgery between the control group (110% ± 70%, n=11), the low-dose fenugreek treatment group (LDF, 105% ± 68%, n=11), and the high-dose fenugreek treatment group (HDF, 153% ± 96%, n=13). Additionally, assessments of elastin structure in the AAA wall using Miller's stain revealed disorganized and ruptured fibers, but no significant differences in the severity of damage or elastin content among the groups were noted. No significant differences were observed in the presence of infiltrating neutrophils (as indicated by myeloperoxidase-positive cells), macrophage infiltration (% CD68-positive area), or area of vascular smooth muscle cells (a-SMA stained cells), or media thickness across control low-dose, and high-dose treatment groups. Conclusions: Daily fenugreek administrations did not halt AAA progression in either low-dose (750 mg/kg/daily) or high-dose (1500 mg/kg/daily) groups when compared to controls. These results did not show any beneficial effects of fenugreek supplementation in the aneurysm wall, and therefore, we can not recommend fenugreek supplementation as a treatment for patients with growing AAAs."

The present study explored the effect of F and IG individually and in combination on SIRT1 protein. Results indicated that a combination of F + IG produced a more significant increase in SIRT1 protein in serum (45 %), heart (24 %), liver (38 %), and kidneys (27.8 %) than individually. The individual potential of IG (14.5 %, 17.1 %, 35.5 %, and 23 % in serum, heart, liver, and kidneys respectively) in enhancing SIRT1 was more pronounced than F (19.2 %, 27 %, 15 %, and 18 % in serum, heart, liver, and kidneys respectively). These findings were consistent with obtained NAD+/NADH ratio. F + IG produced synergistic effect (2-fold and 4-fold increase in catalase and superoxide dismutase respectively) and an additive effect in glutathione peroxidase levels in serum. Glutathione S transferase activity was enhanced by 2.6-fold, 2-fold, and 2.3-fold by F, IG, and F + IG respectively in serum. The study concluded that a combination of F and IG together may be advocated for enhancing SIRT1 protein.",

Fenugreek has some biological effects, including hyperglycemia regulation, immune response modulation, and anti-cancer properties; In this study, we investigated the ameliorative effects of fenugreek seed extract (Forceterone® [FCT]) in a testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH animal model and its mechanisms in BPH-1 human prostate epithelial cells. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were injected subcutaneously with TP (3 mg/kg) for 8 weeks to induce BPH while FCT was administered orally at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg. In addition, BPH-1 cells were used to evaluate the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and examine inflammatory cytokine expression. Treating rats with FCT decreased prostate weight, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in the prostate. Furthermore, it decreased androgen receptor (AR), 5α-reductase 2, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and NF-κB expression in vitro and in vivo and increased Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression. FCT also inhibited cell proliferation dose dependently in BPH-1 cells. These findings showed the potential use of FCT as an alternative treatment for BPH.",

Natural medicines, especially herbs, have been the focus of attention for many years because of the desirable and minimal side effects for controlling blood lipids. PURPOSE: The present study aims to investigate the effect of fenugreek hydrolyzed protein (FHP) on lipid profile in patients with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: This study is a confirmatory, triple-blind, two-group parallel, randomized controlled trial, phase 3 conducted on patients aged 18-65 years with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia and low risk for cardiovascular disease. Patients were recruited from a private clinic from May 2021 to June 2021. Sixty patients were randomized with a 1:1 allocation ratio into the FHP group (N = 30) and the placebo group (N = 30). The intervention group was administrated 40 mg/day of FHP for 8 weeks. Patients were examined at baseline and 8 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome was the patient's lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-c. All participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, and analyzers were blind to the type of intervention. RESULTS: In the intervention group, lipid profile improved through a significant reduction in TC (P < 0.001), LDL-c (P = 0.043), and non-HDL-c (P < 0.001), but no significant changes were observed in the TG level. The mean difference of these variables was -10.07 mg/dl [95 %CI:30.84; 10.70], -8.93 mg/dl [95 %CI:27.07; 9.21], and -10.37 mg/dl [95 %CI:32.26; 11.52] for TC, LDL-c, and non-HDL-c, respectively. FHP successfully decreased LDL-c level by 7 %. There was no significant change in any component of the lipid profile in the comparison group. FHP was well tolerated with only 1 patient experiencing gastrointestinal adverse manifestations. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that FHP administration can improve the lipid profile of patients with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia. Considering the low adverse effects of FHP and patients' high tolerance, it can be considered in the management of these patients, who fall into the low-risk cardiovascular disease category, adjuvant to the main therapies.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acellular nerve allografts (ANAs) have been confirmed to improve the repair and reconstruction of long peripheral nerve defects. However, its efficacy is not comparable to that of autologous nerve grafts, which are used as the gold standard for treating peripheral nerve defects. Our study investigated whether fenugreek seed extract (FSE) exhibits neuroprotective potential and enhances the therapeutic outcomes of ANA repair in peripheral nerve defects. METHODS: Rat Schwann cells were treated with FSE to assess the effects of FSE on cell proliferation and their secretion function of neurotrophic factors in vitro. Sprague-Dawley rats with a unilateral 15-mm sciatic nerve defect were randomized into the ANA group (the 15-mm defect was replaced by an 18-mm ANA), the ANA + FSE group (the 15-mm defect was repaired with an 18-mm ANA with FSE administration for four weeks), and the Auto group (the 15-mm defect was repaired with an autologous graft). After four weeks post-surgery, various behavioral tests and electrophysiological assays were performed to evaluate the motor and sensory behavior as well as nerve conduction of rats. Then, rats were sacrificed, and the nerve grafts were collected for toluidine blue staining, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemical staining to evaluate nerve regeneration, neovascularization, and neuroinflammation. Their gastrocnemius was harvested for Masson's trichrome staining to examine gastrocnemius muscle recovery. RESULTS: FSE treatment promoted Schwann cell proliferation and its secretion of neurotrophic factors in vitro. Compared with ANAs alone, FSE treatment combined with ANAs enhanced axonal regeneration, upregulated S100, NF200, P0, MBP, and GAP43 expression, facilitated angiogenesis, and elevated neurotrophic factor expression in regenerating nerves of rats with sciatic nerve defects. In addition, FSE treatment promoted gastrocnemius muscle recovery, stimulated motor and sensory functional recovery and nerve conduction, and mitigated neuroinflammation in rats with sciatic nerve defects after repair with ANAs. CONCLUSION: FSE treatment improves the beneficial effects of ANA repair on sciatic nerve defects."

      "abstract": "AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of fenugreek as an adjuvant in managing oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), specifically leukoplakia, lichen planus, and oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one participants prediagnosed with OPMDs were randomly divided into a study group (SG) and a control group (CG), with 10 participants in SG and 11 in CG, respectively. The SG received 2 gm of fenugreek as an adjuvant with standard systemic treatments tailored to the respective lesions: intralesional injection of vitamin A 1,00,000 IU (Aquasol A) and topical application of triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% (Kenacort) for 2 months for leukoplakia. Subjects with oral lichen planus were administered prednisolone 5 mg/day (Wysolone), chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (Peridex), and Zincovit once daily for 8 weeks. For subjects with OSMF, one capsule of SM Fibro once daily for 12 weeks along with dexamethasone 1.5 mL (Decadron) was given, and hyaluronidase 1,500 IU (Hynidase) with 0.5 mL lignocaine HCL (Xylocaine) was injected intralesionally biweekly and mouth exercise was advised for 2 months; control group received only the standard treatment. Sociodemographic data were collected, and clinical assessments, evaluating size and shape for leukoplakia, erythema, and burning sensation for oral lichen planus, and mouth opening, cheek flexibility, and burning sensation for OSMF were assessed from baseline through 2 months. Data collected were organized in Excel and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21.0. RESULTS: The SG and CG had 10 and 11 participants, with 4 in each group for leukoplakia, 2 participants in SG and 3 in CG for lichen planus, and 4 participants for OSMF in each group, respectively. Most participants presented with leukoplakia under 2 cm on the buccal mucosa bilaterally, with no significant changes in size or shape postintervention. For lichen planus, mild erythema and burning sensation were noted, but there were no significant differences within or between groups postintervention. A mild burning sensation, a statistically significant improvement in mouth opening was observed in SG (p < 0.051) when compared with CG after 8 weeks postintervention in OSMF. Also, significant improvement in cheek flexibility was noted from baseline to the fourth follow-up in SG post intervention. However, there were no differences between groups during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: The findings from this trial suggest that SG showed significant improvement in OSMF than CG, whereas the improvements in leukoplakia and lichen planus remained same in both groups. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Fenugreek, being a cost-effective and affordable agent known for its anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiulcerative properties, could be used as an adjuvant for its management in OPMDs.

      "abstract": "Salinity stress disrupts water uptake and nutrient absorption, causing reduced photosynthesis, stunted growth, and decreased crop yields in plants. The use of indole acetic acid (IAA), arginine (AN), and mango fruit waste biochar (MFWB) can be effective methods to overcome this problem. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is a natural auxin hormone that aids cell elongation and division, thereby increasing plant height and branching. L-arginine, an amino acid, is crucial for plant defense mechanisms, forming proline, polyamines, and nitric oxide, which regulate biological activities and prevent oxidative damage. Mango fruit waste biochar enhances soil fertility and water retention, thereby enhancing fruit development and yield. This study investigates the effects of combining IAA and AN as amendments to fenugreek, with and without MFWB. Four treatments (control, 2mM IAA, 250 mg/L AN, and 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA) study were conducted in four replications using a completely randomized design. Results demonstrate that the 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB treatment led to a significant rise in fenugreek plant length (30.26%), plant fresh weight (36.37%), and plant dry weight (15.78%) over the control under salinity stress. There was a notable increase in chlorophyll a (5.13%), chlorophyll b (14.06%), total chlorophyll (7.79%), and shoot N, P, K from the control under salinity stress also showing the potential of 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB. In conclusion, applying 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB is a strategy for alleviating salinity stress in fenugreeks.",

This compound possesses certain pharmacological characteristics like anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant etc., that render it a desirable component in the medicinal and nutraceutical industries. Various methods such as, conventional solvent extraction, green extraction methods like Soxhlet extraction, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), maceration methods, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and supercritical fluid extraction methods are employed to extract diosgenin from fenugreek seeds. Fundamentals such as solvent choice, pre-treatment techniques, and optimization parameters, affect the diosgenin extraction process. Furthermore, the quantification of diosgenin is governed by analytical methods(chromatography and spectroscopy), underscoring the significance of standardizing diosgenin levels to set the stage for upcoming pharmacological research. However there have been very negligible resources which focuses on conventional and novel techniques for extraction of diosgenin from Fenugreek seeds. This review aims to provide combined insights into the diverse methodologies employed for diosgenin extraction from fenugreek seeds and their implications in pharmaceutical research.",

This study further explored the effect of FS60 on Cur bioavailability in vivo to assess the significance of this delivery method. In this study, we optimized the formulation parameters of FS60-curcuminoid aggregates (FC) and studied their effects on Cur pharmacokinetics in rats. Results showed that the optimized aggregates had an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 88.22 % and hydrodynamic diameter (DH) of 231.48 nm. Additionally, administering FC significantly increased curcumin glucuronide (Cur-O-Glu) levels. The Cmax was 51 times higher and AUC0-12h was 19 times higher than curcuminoid alone. Moreover, FS60 intervention for seven days increased the absorption speed of Cur-O-Glu into the bloodstream. Further mechanistic studies indicated that FS60 promoted Cur ingestion, increased UGT expression, and inhibited enterocyte transporters, allowing large amounts of Cur-O-Glu to enter the bloodstream. Moreover, the gut microbiota modulated by FS60 accelerated the mutual conversion of pentose and gluconate to provide sufficient glucuronic acid for the glucuronidation of Cur in enterocytes. Consequently, the nano delivery system composed by FS60 and curcuminoid facilitated gastrointestinal Cur glucuronidation and Cur-O-Glu absorption.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythrocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress throughout their lifespan. While compounds like vitamin C can help mitigate oxidative stress, the exploration of natural herbal products continues to be a compelling area of research. To examine the impact of subfractions derived from acidified chloroform fractions of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) on red blood cells in the presence of H2O2 as an oxidant, we assessed the factors associated with erythrocyte aging and oxidative stress. METHODS: The maceration technique was employed for extracting fenugreek seeds. Through chromatography, a total of 12 subfractions were isolated from the acidified chloroform extract of fenugreek seeds. Following an initial assessment, four subfractions exhibiting lower erythrocyte toxicity were chosen for further investigation. The objective was to evaluate their impact on erythrocyte aging by measuring the levels of phosphatidylserine (PS), sialic acid, CD47 on the erythrocyte surface, as well as oxidative stress biomarkers. The obtained results were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and data analysis was performed by using ANOVA. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed, that among the 12 subfractions derived from the acidified chloroform fraction of fenugreek, four subfractions demonstrated protective effects against H2O2-induced hemolysis and oxidative stress. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis indicated that treatment with three of these subfractions led to elevated levels of CD47 and reduced levels of phosphatidylserine on the surface of erythrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the subfractions of fenugreek extract which likely contain a higher concentration of flavonoids and a lower content of saponins could be responsible for the observed protection against erythrocyte aging processes. It appears that fenugreek seeds have the ability to safeguard human erythrocytes from oxidative damage by reducing oxidative stress, preserving the activity of antioxidative enzymes, and maintaining the integrity of erythrocyte structure.",

The seeds and leaves possess a variety of compounds that play an important role in regulating their hypoglycemic effect. However, so far, no extensive systematic review exists on its antidiabetic effect, highlighting the molecular mechanisms and isolated compounds. The purpose of this review is to summarize the preclinical and clinical antidiabetic properties of fenugreek and its isolated compounds by focusing on underlying mechanisms. PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Scopus databases were searched to retrieve articles until June, 2024. Preclinical studies demonstrated that the antidiabetic effect of fenugreek was mostly associated with enhanced glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT4) translocation and hexokinase activity, decreased glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activities, inhibited α-amylase and maltase activities, protected β cells, and increased insulin release. Furthermore, few studies have reported its role as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) modulator, 5'-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activator, and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor. Further clinical trials showed that fenugreek seeds improved blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, and lipid profiles. This study highlights significant evidence of the antidiabetic effect of fenugreek and its isolated compounds; therefore, it could be a potential therapy for diabetes."

METHODS: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was carried out on 54 individuals with T2D. Participants were randomly assigned to a FDE group (received 3 tablets containing 335 mg of FDE daily for 8 weeks) or a placebo group (received tablets containing microcrystalline cellulose). Anthropometric indices, physical activity, diet, fasting blood sugar (FBS), serum insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and PAB were assessed. RESULTS: An eight-week intake of 3 tablets containing 335 mg of FDE decreased serum insulin (P=0.016, P<0.001), HOMA-IR (P=0.009, P<0.001), TG (P<0.001, P=0.001), and PAB (P<0.001, P<0.001) compared to the baseline, in both placebo and intervention groups respectively. TC decreased significantly compared to the baseline in the placebo group (P=0.028), while HDL-C increased in the FDE group compared to the baseline (P<0.001) and placebo group (P=0.014). CONCLUSION: In the present study even though changes of parameters were more in intervention group compared to the control group, we did not observe any significant differences between studied groups except for HDL-C. However, the effects might become apparent with a higher dosage, longer study duration, or a larger sample size compared to the placebo group. Further clinical trials are needed in this regard."

We conducted a randomized double-blind trial with TrigozimR fenugreek extract to assess impact on plasma and saliva testosterone, and some subjective effects. 95 men (40-80y) completed a 12-week intervention, taking 3 tablets daily with 0 mg (placebo; n = 22), 600 mg (n = 21), 1200 mg (n = 25) and1800 mg (n = 27) fenugreek extract and essential nutrients. Samples were collected at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 12. Participants answered a pre- and post-intervention questionnaire on lifestyle and libido. We measured total testosterone (HPLC-MS/MS) and sex hormone binding globulin (ELISA), calculated free testosterone index (FTI), and measured saliva testosterone. Plasma total testosterone and FTI increased after any dose of TrigozimR vs. baseline (13.0%, p = 1.0x10-4 and 16.3%, p = 6.2x10-6), but not vs. placebo (9.0%, p = 0.122 and 11.3% p = 0.059). 1800 mg TrigozimR resulted in 12.2% increased FTI (p = 0.025). Saliva testosterone concentration increased after any dose of TrigozimR vs. baseline (31.1%, p = 2.3x10-4) and vs. placebo (37.2%, p = 0.042). 1800 mg TrigozimR for 12 weeks resulted in 19.6% (p = 0.006) increased saliva testosterone. Compliance was confirmed by enhanced plasma concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3. We observed no subjective effects or side-effects of TrigozimR. TrigozimR increased saliva and plasma testosterone concentration during intervention but only for saliva vs. placebo.

      "abstract": "Sprouts are an attractive food product that contains high amounts of nutritional substances and has pro-health features. Sprout consumption has strongly increased despite its potential risk to health due to its microbial load. Both the safety and shelf life of sprouts may be negatively affected by a high microbial load. To reduce the microbial contamination in sprouts before consumption, the initial microbial load on the seeds needs to be controlled. Many herbal sprouts have been recommended for diabetes, and fenugreek is one of these sprouts. Thus, the current experiment aimed at disinfecting fenugreek seeds using microwave (5, 10, and 20 s) and hot water (30, 45, and 60 s) treatments for different durations. The best-disinfected sprouts with the highest nutritional properties were used to evaluate their influence on streptozocin-induced diabetic rats in comparison with fenugreek seed feeding. Microwave treatments showed the highest sprout length, fresh weight, total free amino acids, antioxidants, reducing sugars, and total phenols. Additionally, microwave seed treatments showed the lowest bacteria and mold counts on sprouts produced relative to hot water treatments, and the best seed treatment was a microwave for 20 s, which gave the best values in this respect. Feeding diabetic rats with different fenugreek seeds or sprout rates (0, 5, 7.5, and 10% w/w) improved body weight, restricted the growth of glucose levels, lowered total cholesterol and triglycerides, and improved HDL compared with the positive control group, and fenugreek sprouts at higher rates showed the maximum improvements in blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Treating fenugreek seed with microwave radiation for 20 s to disinfect the seeds before sprouting is recommended for lowering the microbial load with optimum nutritional and antioxidant activity, and feeding diabetic rats with these sprouts at the rate of 7.5 and 10% had promising effects on hyperglycemia and associated disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that fenugreek seeds are a rich source of fiber with anti-diabetic effects, which can help to lower blood glucose in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this study, the clinical and metabolic effects of fenugreek were compared to those of metformin in women with PCOS aged 16-40 years. METHODS: In a randomized, triple-blind, parallel clinical trial, the efficacy of fenugreek 333 mg (n=55) was compared with metformin 500 mg (n=55), both administered three times a day in women with PCOS of reproductive age. Changes in some clinical outcomes and metabolic laboratory profile outcomes were evaluated at baseline and two months after the study. RESULTS: By the end of the intervention period, all investigated factors improved significantly in patients of both groups (p<0.05). Reduction in biometric indices (body mass index and waist-hip ratio), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and insulin resistance was significantly higher after metformin consumption (p<0.001). Metformin also significantly improved irregular menstruation (p=0.02). In contrast, fenugreek significantly improved patients' lipid profiles, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) compared to metformin (p<0.001). Both interventions improved the patient's hair loss and hirsutism. CONCLUSION: Fenugreek cannot substitute metformin in PCOS treatment. However, regarding its lipid-lowering ability and low frequency of adverse effects, it can be used as an adjuvant treatment in PCOS, especially in PCOS patients with hyper-lipidemia and severe hair loss."

      "abstract": "The quality of pistachio, one of the export products of Iran, will be decreased during storage as a result of mold spoilage, toxins production, and oil oxidation. This study aimed to investigate the capability of pistachio hull extract (PHE) loaded in fenugreek seed gum (FSG):whey protein isolate (WPI) nanoemulsion to control oil oxidation, and fungi growth in fresh pistachio nut during storage at 4°C. The total anthocyanin and total phenolic content of the PHE were 125.44 μg/g and 675.18 mg/g, respectively. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of PHE at 100 ppm was higher than that of tert-butylhydroquinon (TBHQ). In comparison with other concentrations, 50 ppm showed the strongest antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus nomius. All nanoemulsions have a mean size lower than 265 nm. The polydispersity index (PDI) of different nanoemulsions was lower than 0.3, and a negative zeta potential was observed. The encapsulation efficiency was higher than 67.0% and all nanoemulsions had spherical morphology. The pistachio nuts were coated with different coating solutions containing 0 and 100 ppm of PHE and stored at 4°C for 8 weeks. The results showed that the pistachio sample coated with a composite coating of WPI and FSG containing 100 ppm of PHE has a higher moisture content and lower changes in L*, a*, and b* indexes, oil oxidation, fungi development, and total mold and yeast count. This treatment exhibited higher overall acceptance than other samples at the end of storage time. The results of this study suggest the use of biodegradable coatings enriched with natural extracts that have high antioxidant and antifungal activities."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The young wistar strain albino rats are divided in to 5 groups and treatment was given as per the experimental protocol. Antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels are estimated in cardiac tissue of all experimental groups. Cardiac markers creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), troponin-T (TT), troponin-I (TI), myoglobin (MG) and serum markers alanine transaminase (AAT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are estimated. Free radical scavenging activities like 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical are estimated in ethanolic extract of Trigonella foenum-graecum. RESULTS: SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, GSH activities are depleted and MDA, CK-MB, TT, TI, MG and AAT, AST, ALP activities are elevated in alcohol intoxicated rats. Trigonelline supplementation to alcoholic rats for 30 days elevated antioxidant enzymes, depleted MDA, cardiac markers and serum markers in alcohol intoxicated rats. Free radical scavenging assay also reported that Trigonella foenum-graecum possess free radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, our histopathological evidence also proved that TG protected the cardiac tissue from alcohol induced toxicity in all the experimental rats. CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that TG may be useful to the alcoholic and myocardial infarction subjects."

The specific targets and underlying mechanisms responsible for the ameliorative effects of the stilbenoid compounds found in fenugreek seeds for ameliorating IR require further study. Here, we were predicted by using the network pharmacology prediction, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approach the targets in common and the potential mechanismsof three stilbenoid compounds (rhaponticin, desoxyrhaponticin, and rhapontigenin) in relation to T2DM and IR. The results showed that the compounds may improve IR through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. Molecular docking studies revealed that they exhibit high binding affinity with the structural domains of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), PI3K, and AKT. These results suggest that PPARG and GAPDH may be the potential targets for these three compounds in the treatment of T2DM.Subsequently, experiments using the zebrafish T2DM model showed that the stilbenoid compounds had varying degrees of efficacy in improving IR through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and rhaponticin had the most promising effects. The findings implicate a potential mechanism of action for the three stilbenoid compounds in enhancing insulin resistance (IR) through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway."

      "abstract": "Diabetes is becoming a significant health concern in Asia, where the prevalence has reached alarming levels. An important contributing factor is the consumption of high-carbohydrate foods, including rice, bread, etc. These high-carbohydrate foods pose a major risk to public health due to their impact on postprandial hyperglycemia. This research aimed to formulate a chickpea pulao (cooked Indian-Pakistani rice dish) and to evaluate its effects on postprandial blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic individuals. Antioxidant potential and total phenolic contents of herbs at different concentrations (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9%) were measured through DPPH and Folin Ciocalteu assays. The antidiabetic potential was tested by α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition assays. After sensory evaluation, the best-chosen concentration was used to formulate the chickpea pulao. The study trial was advertised under \"DP trial,\" and 12 participants were recruited. A single-blind randomized cross-over trial was conducted for 3 weeks with a one-week wash-over time in between. Participants' preprandial and postprandial blood glucose levels were recorded for control and intervention recipes. Results indicated that both fenugreek seeds (FS) and Indian rennet (IR) showed good antioxidant and hypoglycemic activity (p = .000) in raw and boiled extracts. For DPPH, the IC50 values of unboiled and boiled combined (FS + IR) extracts were calculated as 7.4% and 8.02%, respectively. Similarly, for α-amylase, the IC50 values of combined IR and FS unboiled and boiled extracts were 6.58% and 6.83%, and for α-glucosidase inhibition assay, the values were measured as 14.98% and 16.24%. The single-blind randomized cross-over trial showed that consuming the intervention recipe significantly reduced postprandial hyperglycemia (p = .000) in type 2 diabetic participants. The intervention recipe decreased hyperglycemia by approximately 15% daily compared to the control recipe. Incorporation of hypoglycemic herbs into dietary patterns can work as an adjunct therapy for diabetes management, especially in populations with a high prevalence of this disease."

Wound care was the target of many research, utilizing new therapy techniques and the progression of acute and chronic wound treatments with techniques involving plants to improve healing and decrease the side effects of drugs. When fenugreek is applied to an ulcer, its anti-inflammatory components are released, reducing unnecessary inflammation and accelerating the healing process. Healing is controlled by growth factors that naturally activate and boost the proliferation of cells, such as Ki-67, which is associated with the growth fraction and represents the cell's ability to proliferate. The current study aims to assess the expression of Ki-67 in rat mucosal ulcers treated with fenugreek leave oil. Twenty-four male Wistar albino rats of 350-450 gm weight were used. The rats were grouped as follows; normal group (normal tissue without ulcer induction), control group (tissue with surgical ulcer induction on the right side), and study group (ulcer treated with fenugreek leave oil on the left side), and had been sacrificed at 3- and 7-day healing durations. Thereafter, the tissue specimens were used for immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67. The obtained outcomes showed that expression of Ki-67 increased in groups where ulcers were induced, with significant differences between control and study groups on the 3rd day. It was concluded that the application of fenugreek oil had an accelerating effect on the healing process of mucosal ulcers, as indicated by the elevated expression level of Ki-67.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fenugreek plant (Trigonella foenum-graecum) constitutes a traditionally acclaimed herbal remedy for many human ailments including diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, and reproductive disorders. It is also used as an effective anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-fungal agent. The seed of the plant is especially enriched in several bioactive molecules including polyphenols, saponins, alkaloids, and flavonoids and has demonstrated potential to act as an antidiabetic phytotherapeutic. A novel patented formulation (Fenfuro®) was developed in our laboratory from the fenugreek seeds which contained >45% furostanolic saponins (HPLC). OBJECTIVE: A placebo-controlled clinical compliance study was designed to assess the effects of complementing Fenfuro® on a randomized group of human volunteers on antidiabetic therapy (Metformin and sulphonylurea) in controlling the glycemic index along with simultaneous safety assessment. STUDY METHODOLOGY AND TRIAL DESIGN: In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 42 individuals (21 male and 21 female volunteers) in the treatment group (out of 57 enrolled) and 39 individuals (17 male and 22 female volunteers) in the placebo group (out of 47 enrolled), all on antidiabetic therapy with Metformin/Metformin with sulphonyl urea within the age group of 18-65 years were administered either 1,000 mg (500 mg × 2) (Fenfuro®) capsules or placebo over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. Fasting and postprandial glucose along with glycated hemoglobin were determined as primary outcomes to assess the antidiabetic potential of the formulation. Moreover, in order to evaluate the safety of the formulation, C-peptide and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels as well as immunohematological parameters were assessed between the treatment and placebo groups at the completion of the study. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of administration, both fasting as well as postprandial serum glucose levels decreased by 38 and 44% respectively in the treatment group. Simultaneously, a significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin by about 34.7% was also noted. The formulation did not have any adverse effect on the study subjects as there was no significant change in C- peptide level and TSH level; liver, kidney, and cardiovascular function was also found to be normal as assessed by serum levels of key immunohematological parameters. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: This clinical compliance study re-instated and established the safety and efficacy of Fenfuro® as an effective phytotherapeutic to treat hyperglycemia."

      "abstract": "The fenugreek plant (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is traditionally known for its anti-diabetic properties owing to its high content of furostanolic saponins, which can synergistically treat many human ailments. Non-enzymatic protein glycation leading to the formation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGE) is a common pathophysiology observed in diabetic or prediabetic individuals, which can initiate the development of neurodegenerative disorders. A potent cellular source of glycation is Methyl Glyoxal, a highly reactive dicarbonyl formed as a glycolytic byproduct. We demonstrate the in vitro glycation arresting potential of Fenfuro®, a novel patented formulation of Fenugreek seed extract with clinically proven anti-diabetic properties, in Methyl-Glyoxal (MGO) adducts of three abundant amyloidogenic cellular proteins, alpha-synuclein, Serum albumin, and Lysozyme. A 0.25% w/v Fenfuro® was able to effectively arrest glycation by more than 50% in all three proteins, as evidenced by AGE fluorescence. Glycation-induced amyloid formation was also arrested by more than 36%, 14% and 15% for BSA, Alpha-synuclein and Lysozyme respectively. An increase in MW by attachment of MGO was also partially prevented by Fenfuro® as confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Glycation resulted in enhanced aggregation of the three proteins as revealed by Native PAGE and Dynamic Light Scattering. However, in the presence of Fenfuro®, aggregation was arrested substantially, and the normal size distribution was restored. The results cumulatively indicated the lesser explored potential of direct inhibition of glycation by fenugreek seed in addition to its proven role in alleviating insulin resistance. Fenfuro® boosts its therapeutic potential as an effective phytotherapeutic to arrest Type 2 diabetes.",

In the present study, zirconium MOF-based fenugreek composite (FG/Zr-AIPA) beads were synthesised by a single droplet method and utilised for removal of Cr(VI), Pb(II) and Fe(III) from aqueous solution. The structure, morphology and composition of beads were evaluated by FTIR, XRD, TGA, BET, FESEM, EDX, XPS and zeta potential analysis. Adsorption isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamics were studied for Cr(VI), Pb(II) and Fe(III) adsorption.

The maximum adsorption capacity was 344.43, 270.02 and 223.21 mg g-1 for Cr(VI), Pb(II) and Fe(III), respectively, based on the Langmuir isotherm study. The thermodynamics study revealed that the interaction between the metal ions and the composite beads was spontaneous and endothermic.

      "abstract": "Medicinal plants are rich sources for treating various diseases due their bioactive secondary metabolites. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is one of the medicinal plants traditionally used in human nutrition and medicine which contains an active substance, called diosgenin, with anticancer properties. Biosynthesis of this important anticancer compound in fenugreek can be enhanced using eliciting agents which involves in manipulation of metabolite and biochemical pathways stimulating defense responses. Methyl jasmonate elicitor was used to increase diosgenin biosynthesis in fenugreek plants. However, the molecular mechanism and gene expression profiles underlying diosgening accumulation remain unexplored. In the current study we performed an extensive analysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets to elucidate the biosynthesis and expression profile of fenugreek plants treated with methyl jasmonate. For this purpose, seven read datasets of methyl jasmonate treated plants were obtained that were covering several post-treatment time points (6-120 h). Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of several key genes involved in diosgenein biosynthetic pathway including Squalene synthase (SQS) as the first committed step in diosgenin biosynthesis as well as Squalene Epoxidase (SEP) and Cycloartenol Synthase (CAS) upon methyl jasmonate application. Bioinformatics analysis, including gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis, further supported the involvement of these genes in diosgenin biosynthesis. The bioinformatics analysis led to a comprehensive validation, with expression profiling across three different fenugreek populations treated with the same methyl jasmonate application. Initially, key genes like SQS, SEP, and CAS showed upregulation, followed by later upregulation of Δ24, suggesting dynamic pathway regulation. Real-time PCR confirmed consistent upregulation of SQS and SEP, peaking at 72 h. Additionally, candidate genes Δ24 and SMT1 highlighted roles in directing metabolic flux towards diosgenin biosynthesis. This integrated approach validates the bioinformatics findings and elucidates fenugreek's molecular response to methyl jasmonate elicitation, offering insights for enhancing diosgenin yield. The assembled transcripts and gene expression profiles are deposited in the Zenodo open repository at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8155183 .",

This study examined the efficacy of ascaroside (ascr)#18 treatment for the control of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) growth on sprouts. Commercial alfalfa and fenugreek seeds were decontaminated with 20,000 ppm of NaClO, and residual chlorine was neutralized with Dey-Engley broth. Decontaminated seeds were treated with 1 mM or 1 μM ascr#18, a plant immunity modulator, before being dried and mixed with sandy soil inoculated with E. coli F4546 or BAA-2326 at 104-105 CFU/g. The inoculated seeds were sprouted on 1% water agar at 25ºC for 7 days in the dark. Seed or sprout samples were collected on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 for enumeration of bacterial populations. Data was fit into the general linear model and analyzed using Fisher's least significant different test of the statistical analysis software. Treatment with ascr#18 significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced the cell population of EHEC on sprouts. The mean EHEC populations in the 1 mM or 1 μM treatment groups were 3.31 or 1.56 log CFU/g lower compared to the control groups. Besides treatment, sprout seed type and sprouting time were also significant independent variables influencing the growth of EHEC, according to the results of type III error analysis. However, EHEC strain type was not a significant independent variable. The study suggests that ascr#18 could be potentially used to control EHEC contamination and improve the microbial safety of sprouts."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Quantifying gene expression is a critical aspect of applied genomics research across all organisms, and real-time PCR has emerged as a powerful tool for this purpose. However, selecting appropriate internal control genes for data normalization presents specific challenges. This study aimed to identify suitable reference genes for gene expression analysis under various conditions, encompassing salinity, low and high-temperature stresses, and different elicitor treatments. These treatments included titanium dioxide, cold plasma, 24-epibrassinolide, and melatonin, resulting in a total of 13 unique treatments and 148 treatment combinations applied to fenugreek plants. RESULTS: As per the analysis performed with the BestKeeper tool, EEF-1α, and GAPDH were recognized as the most stable reference genes under the majority of conditions. Furthermore, the GeNorm and NormFinder tools identified β-tubulin and EEF-1α as the most stable reference genes. The findings of this research demonstrated that, although the stability of three reference genes expression was acceptable in almost all evaluated treatments, fluctuations in their expression were observed under the treatments of cold stress with TiO2 NPs application, cold plasma application with salinity stress, and cold plasma application with high-temperature stress compared to others. Simultaneously, the GeNorm analysis results demonstrated that in the mentioned treatments, relying on only one reference gene is inadequate. To corroborate the results, we examined the expression profile of the SSR gene, a pivotal gene in diosgenin biosynthesis, under all investigated treatments and treatment combinations. The outcomes suggested that employing stable reference genes yielded highly consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: The varying expression patterns of the target genes emphasize the crucial need for precise optimization of experimental conditions and selecting stable reference genes to achieve accurate results in gene expression studies utilizing real-time PCR. These findings offer valuable insights into the selection of appropriate reference genes for gene expression analysis under diverse conditions using real-time PCR."

This study was carried out to investigate the effect of zinc (Zn) and boron (B) as foliar applications on fenugreek growth and physiology under salt stress (0 and 120 mM). After 35 days of salt treatments, three levels of zinc (0, 50, and 100 ppm) and two levels of boron (0 and 2 ppm) were applied as a foliar application. Salinity significantly reduced root length (72.7%) and shoot length (33.9%), plant height (36%), leaf area (37%), root fresh weight (48%) and shoot fresh weight (75%), root dry weight (80%) and shoot dry weight (67%), photosynthetic pigments (78%), number of branches (50%), and seeds per pod (56%). Fenugreek's growth and physiology were improved by foliar spray of zinc and boron, which increased the length of the shoot (6%) and root length (2%), fresh root weight (18%), and dry root weight (8%), and chlorophyll a (1%), chlorophyll b (25%), total soluble protein content (3%), shoot calcium (9%) and potassium (5%) contents by significantly decreasing sodium ion (11%) content. Moreover, 100 ppm of Zn and 2 ppm of B enhanced the growth and physiology of fenugreek by reducing the effect of salt stress.

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that endangers the entire body's tissues and organs. Diabetes impairs glucose and insulin regulation in the human body by causing pancreatic cell damage. Diabetes modifies pathways such as serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt) and Protein kinase C (PKC)/- glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) glucose absorption, and inhibits α-amylase and α-glucosidase, Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT-1), and Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Diabetes may also be caused by a decrease in the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and its target genes, fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACC), as well as a decrease in the levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Caspase12, and Caspase3 proteins. Diabetes has long been linked to diseases of the cardiovascular, nervous, skeletal, reproductive, hepatic, ocular, and renal systems. Diosgenin, a steroidal compound derived from fenugreek, aids in the prevention of diabetes by altering cellular pathways in favor of healthy bodily functions. Diosgenin is a new nutraceutical on the market that claims to cure diabetes in particular. This article focuses on diosgenin extraction and purification, fenugreek bioactive compounds, pharmacological properties of diosgenin, mode of action of diosgenin to cure diabetes, and dosages."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, it is increasingly crucial to combine innovative approaches with established methods to enhance plant tolerance and maximize the production of beneficial compounds. With this aim in view, a study was carried out to investigate how different melatonin concentrations (0, 30, and 60 ppm), cold plasma treatment (at 3000 and 4000 V), and varying exposure durations (0, 1, 2, and 4 min) affect the physiological and biochemical attributes of fenugreek plants, as well as the levels of diosgenin under salinity stress. This study revealed that the application of 3000 V cold plasma for 2 min with 60 ppm melatonin by establishing cellular redox homeostasis in salinity-treated fenugreek plants, effectively prevented the destruction of pigments and reduced the electrolyte leakage index of malondialdehyde content. The utilization of these two elicitors has the potential to trigger multiple pathways, including the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants biosynthesis, and abscisic acid-dependent pathways. This activation results in an enhanced production of abscisic acid, auxin, and endogenous melatonin, along with the regulation of signal transduction pathways. Surprisingly, applying these two treatments increased the expression of SQS, CAS, SSR, BGL, SEP, SMT, and diosgenin content by 13, 22.5, 21.6, 19, 15.4, 12, and 6 times respectively. The findings highlight the intricate interplay between these treatments and the positive impact of their combined application, opening up avenues for further research and practical applications in improving plant tolerance to environmental stresses.",

FSE (0.3 mg/mL) could scavenge 58.79% of the hydroxyl radical and possessed good antioxidation. FSE could retard the oxidation of MP, and the carbonyl formation and total sulfhydryl loss of MP decreased by 42.00% and 105.94%, respectively, after 4.67% of FSE treatment. SDS-PAGE results showed that 0.67% and 2.67% of FSE decreased the strength of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin bands of the oxidized MP, respectively. The FSE changed the secondary structures of the MP and promoted the unfolding of the MP structure and the transformation from α-helix to β-turn. When treated with 0.67% of FSE, the hydrophobicity of the MP declined by 26.14%, and solubility was improved by 37.21% compared with the oxidation group. After 0.67% of FSE treatment, the particle size and zeta potential of the MP returned to the level of the blank group. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that FSE improved the apparent morphology of the MP. Overall, FSE had positive effects on the antioxidation of the duck MP, and it could improve the structure and characteristics of the MP. It is hoped that FSE could be considered as a natural antioxidant to retard the oxidation of the MP in meat products."

      "abstract": "Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) has a great beneficial health effect; it has been used in traditional medicine by many cultures. Likewise, the α-amylase inhibitors are potential compounds in the development of drugs for the treatment of diabetes. The beneficial health effects of fenugreek lead us to explore the chemical composition of the seeds and their antioxidant and α-amylase inhibition activities. The flavonoid extraction from fenugreek seeds was achieved with methanol through a Soxhlet apparatus. Then, the flavonoid glycosides were characterized using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS analysis. The antioxidant capacity of fenugreek seed was measured using DPPH, FRAP, ABTS, and CUPRAC assays. Finally, the α-amylase inhibition activity was carried out using in vitro and in silico methods. The methanolic extract was found to contain high amounts of total phenolics (154.68 ± 1.50 μg GAE/mg E), flavonoids (37.69 ± 0.73 μg QE/mg E). The highest radical-scavenging ability was recorded for the methanolic extract against DPPH (IC50 = 556.6 ± 9.87 μg/mL), ABTS (IC50 = 593.62 ± 9.35 μg/mL). The ME had the best reducing power according to the CUPRAC (A 0.5 = 451.90 ± 9.07 μg/mL). The results indicate that the methanolic extracts of fenugreek seed best α-amylase inhibition activities IC50 = 653.52 ± 3.24 μg/mL. Twenty-seven flavonoids were detected, and all studied flavonoids selected have good affinity and stabilize very well in the pocket of α-amylase. The interactions between the studied flavonoids with α-amylase were investigated. The flavonoids from fenugreek seed present a good inhibitory effect against α-amylase, which is beneficial for the prevention of diabetes and its complications.",

      "abstract": "During smoking, nicotine, the most bountiful compound in cigarettes, is absorbed into the body by the lungs and quickly metabolized in the liver, causing three major adverse impacts such as toxic, neoplastic, and immunomodulatory effects. Saponins extracted from several plants are reported to exhibit various biological actions, such as anticancer effects. So, the potential protective effect of fenugreek saponin and nanofenugreek saponin against toxicity induced by nicotine in male rats was investigated in this study. Animals were exposed to nicotine (1.5 mg/kg/day) and/or treated with fenugreek saponin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day) and nanofenugreek saponin (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day). Comet assays, histopathological examination, and analyses for the expression levels of glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) genes in liver tissues as well as the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were conducted. The results revealed that nicotine treatment induced a significant increase in DNA damage, decrease in the expression levels of (GLAST) and (GLT-1) genes, and increase in histopathological alterations in liver tissues. Moreover, nicotine treatment induced a significant reduction in the activity of antioxidant enzymes GPx and GST. On the other hand, administration of fenugreek saponin or nanofenugreek saponin with nicotine significantly decreased the DNA damage, increased the expression levels of (GLAST) and (GLT-1) genes, and decreased histopathological alterations in liver tissues. Additionally, a significant increase in the activities of GPx and GST was observed. The results suggested that DNA damage and histological injuries induced by nicotine were decreased by the administration of fenugreek saponin or nanofenugreek saponin; thus, fenugreek saponin and nanofenugreek saponin can be used as ameliorative agents against nicotine toxicity."

Fenugreek seed extracts have been reported to have potential roles in bone metabolism. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of fenugreek seed ethanolic extract (FSEE) on bone cells, inflammation, hormones, and angiogenesis parameters of alveolar bone tissue following teeth extraction in an ovariectomized (OVX) model. METHODS: A total of 30 adults female Wistar rats were assigned into two major groups. Each group consisted of control, OVX, OVX+FSEE 100 mg/kg BW, OVX+FSEE 200 mg/kg BW, and OVX+FSEE 400 mg/kg BW. The FSEE treatment was applied through the intragastric route for 7 days in the first group and for 30 days in the second group of animals. The first molar tooth of the right maxilla was extracted before the FSEE treatment. The level of 17β-estradiol was measured by the ELISA method. The dissected maxilla alveolar bone processus was sectioned for histological evaluation by hematoxylin-eosin staining and an immunohistochemistry assay. RESULTS: This study found that FSEE reduced the blood estrogen level and increased estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) expression. FSEE administration modified the number of bone cells, angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), sclerostin, and the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (OPG/RANKL) ratio. Alterations were seen in the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and the macrophage-1/macrophage-2 (M1/M2) ratio. CONCLUSION: In this study, inflammation was found to be attenuated by reductions in IL-6 and sclerostin, and an increase in TGF-β1. The maturation of bone osteocytes increased along with the increase in ER-α expression and ratio of OPG/RANKL."

      "abstract": "Benign Prostate Cancer (BPC), a prevalent condition predominantly affecting elderly males, manifests with voiding difficulties and urinary retention. A library of compounds from Trigonella foenum-graecum, commonly known as fenugreek was used in this study. We aimed to explore its potential anti-cancer effects by computationally assessing its inhibitory activity on the androgen receptor (AR). For in-silico drug assessment, we employed Maestro 12.8, part of the Schrödinger Suite, to identify the most promising candidates acting as androgen receptor antagonists in the treatment of BPC. Subsequently, 59 fenugreek compounds were retrieved from the PubChem database and subjected to molecular docking against the active site of the target protein, 1E3G. 100-nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to assess the stability and compactness of the AR-ligand complexes. Notably, the AR-kaempferol complex exhibited the least fluctuation within the AR active site throughout the simulation trajectory, followed by chlorogenic acid and the reference ligand, hydroxyflutamide. The MM/GBSA values revealed the compounds' maximum free binding energy (-103.3 ± 6, -87.4 ± 23, -68.5 ΔGbind) for chlorogenic acid, kaempferol, and hydroxyflutamide, respectively. These findings suggest their potential as promising leads for drug development. Further lead optimization and comprehensive studies on the top-ranked ligands identified in this investigation are warranted to advance their potential as therapeutic agents for BPC treatment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague Dawley rats aged 0-2 days and incubated with various concentrations of fenugreek (10-320 µg/ml) and CoCl2-induced hypoxia for different durations (24, 48, and 72 hr). Cell viability, calcium signaling, beating rate, and gene expression were evaluated. RESULTS: Fenugreek treatments did not cause any toxicity in cardiomyocytes. At a concentration of 160 µg/ml for 24 hr, fenugreek protected the heart against CoCl2-induced hypoxia, as evidenced by reduced expression of caspases (-3, -6, -8, and -9) and other functional genes markers, such as HIF-1α, Bcl-2, IP3R, ERK5, and GLP-1r. Calcium signaling and beating rate were also improved in fenugreek-treated cardiomyocytes. In contrast, CoCl2 treatment resulted in up-regulation of the hypoxia gene HIF-1α and apoptotic caspases gene (-3, -9, -8, -12), and down-regulation of Bcl-2 activity. CONCLUSION: Fenugreek treatment at a concentration of 160 µg/ml was not toxic to neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and protected against CoCl2-induced hypoxia. Furthermore, fenugreek improved calcium signaling and beating rate and altered gene expression. Fenugreek may be a potential therapeutic agent for promoting cardioprotection against hypoxia-induced injuries."

      "abstract": "Fenugreek is a widely used herbal medicine as a complementary therapy for diabetes mellitus. Lots of clinical trials have proved its beneficial effect on glycemic control parameters and lipid profiles. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fenugreek as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), Korean studies Information Service System (KISS), Research Information Sharing Service (RISS), and ScienceON to select RCTs which used fenugreek targeting hyperglycemia with a control group. We used either a random effect model or a fixed model in a meta-analysis of Fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2 h plasma glucose during a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (2-hPG), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)/total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), body mass index (BMI). After screening, a total of 10 studies (706 participants) remained. Fenugreek significantly reduced FBG, 2-hPG, and HbA1c, but it did not significantly decrease HOMA-IR. Moreover, it significantly improved TC, TG, and HDL-C, while there were no significant differences in LDL-C and BMI. Hepatic or renal toxicity was not observed, and there were no severe adverse events associated with fenugreek despite mild gastrointestinal side effects in some studies. In conclusion, fenugreek improves overall glycemic control parameters and lipid profile safely."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sustainable agriculture and meeting the world's food needs face considerable obstacles from abiotic stresses such as soil salinity and drought. This critical issue was addressed by our current study, which sought to uncover multi-trait bioinoculants from hostile ecosystems that could help mitigate salinity and drought stresses at the same time. METHODS: The Bacillus subtilis ER-08 (BST) strain was isolated from the halotolerant plant Fagonia cretica which was collected from the Little Rann of Kachchh, India. Various biochemical and molecular approaches were applied for the detailed characterization of the BST isolate. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The BST isolate demonstrated notable plant growth-promoting qualities. Fenugreek seed biopriming was performed using the BST isolate. The effect of BST seed treatment on fenugreek developmental indices as well as abiotic alleviation was examined under greenhouse conditions. The BST produced 83.7 g ml-1 gibberellins (GA3) and 176.1 g ml-1 indole-3 acetic acid. Moreover, hydrogen cyanide, siderophore, exopolysaccharides (EPS), ammonia, cellulase, protease, pectinase, and chitinase were also produced by the BST strain. Interestingly, 52% of Fusarium oxysporum mycelial growth was suppressed by the BST isolate under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, BST isolates functioned well under several abiotic stress conditions, for instance, salinity (4 and 6 ds m-1), pH (5, 7, and 9), drought (PEG6000 at 10%, 20%, and 30%), and temperature (25°C, 35°C, 37°C, and 55°C). This study indicates that the BST strain might serve as an effective bio-inoculant for minimizing the detrimental effects of abiotic stresses."

Fenugreek seed gums (FSG) were used to coat Fe3O4 NPs to prevent their decomposition and to facilitate the release of silver nanoparticles in aqueous media. The Fe3O4/FSG/Ag nanocomposites were characterized and then the antibacterial activity of the nanocomposites was evaluated against two gram-negative and two gram-positive bacteria and compared with Fe3O4, Fe3O4/FSG, FSG, and AgNO3. The results showed that the Fe3O4/FSG/Ag nanocomposites had higher antibacterial activity than the other samples and could be easily removed from treated water by a powerful magnet without causing pollution in the environment. Overall, these findings suggest that the Fe3O4/FSG/Ag nanocomposites have potential applications in water treatment for their improved antibacterial properties and ease of removal.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dysmenorrhea is the most common periodic pain, which affects more than 50% of women with regular menstruation. Fenugreek is one of the medicinal plants with analgesic properties. This study aimed to determine the effect of fenugreek application in the severity of dysmenorrhea and its side effects in women with dysmenorrhea. PICO: Population: women with dysmenorrhea; Intervention: fenugreek; Comparison: control groups; and Outcome: reduction in the severity of dysmenorrhea and its side effects. METHODS: English database (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) and Persian database [SID (Scientific Information Database) and Magiran] were used for research until February 11, 2023, using the keywords \"Dysmenorrhea [Mesh],\" \"Foenum [Mesh],\" \"fenugreek [Mesh],\" and \"Trigonella [Mesh].\" The reference list of the selected articles was also checked. The quality assessment was conducted through the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 5.2.0. The RevMan 5.3 software was used to analyze and report the data of the entered studies. Meta-analysis results were reported with the standardized mean difference (95% confidence interval). A subgroup analysis was performed based on the type of control groups. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: After removing duplicates and ineligible cases, four articles were included in the systematic review out of the 1526 records obtained. The results showed that the pain intensity caused by primary dysmenorrhea decreased with fenugreek compared to placebo (pooled result SMD: -2.21; 95% CI: -3.26 to -1.17; Z: 4.17; p <0.001). There was no significant difference between fenugreek with mefenamic acid (SMD: 0.05; 95% CI: -0.57 to 0.67; Z: 0.17; p = 0.86) and fenugreek with Chandrasura churna (SMD: 0.06; 95% CI: -0.56 to 0.68; Z: 0.19; p = 0.85). Bias, in terms of incomplete outcome data and selective reporting, was low risk in all studies, and the available evidence was low quality according to the GRADE approach. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the effect of fenugreek on pain intensity in dysmenorrhea is highly uncertain. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Regarding the importance of the health and quality of life of women of reproductive age and the low quality of evidence of the studies, clinical trials with stronger methodology are suggested in this field.",

      "abstract": "Senescence is a natural phenomenon of growing old. It accelerates under certain conditions like diabetes mellitus resulting in early decline of bodily functions, which can be avoided by many claimed functional foods. The present study aims to investigate the anti-aging ability of Fenugreek seeds (Trigonellafoenum-graecum); a common ingredient of Indo-Pak cuisines. Briefly, the Fenugreek seeds extract (FgSE) in concentrationsof0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml inhibited the formation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) and fructosamine adducts in Bovine serum albumin (BSA)/fructose model in vitro. The BSA conformational analysis via Circular Dichorism and Congo red assays showed that it preserves secondary structure of BSA in aforementioned model. Although mechanistic studies revealed insignificant lysine blocking ability of Fenugreek by OPA assay, however carbonyl entrapping was found to be 24%, 34% and 42% at 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml, respectively. In vivo model of High Fructose diet (HFD) induced glycation, FgSE treatment in doses of 10, 25 & 50 mg/kg markedly improved Escape latency (p < 0.01) and preserved cognition in Morris Water Maze. Our data further exhibits significant decrease of CML (Nε-carboxymethyl lysine) levels in serum and hippocampus byFgSE treatment in comparison with HFD group. Therefore, we deduced that FgSE prevents glycation-induced memory decline via entrapping the reactive carbonyl intermediates, formed during production of AGEs. Hence, as a promising functional food it slows down the harmful process of glycation and aging associated morbidities."

      "abstract": "The significance of angiogenesis in tumour progression has been widely documented. Hence, the identification of anti-angiogenic agents with fewer common side effects would be valuable in cancer therapy. In this study, we evaluated the anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects of a hydro-alcoholic extract of fenugreek seed (HAEF) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with various concentrations of HAEF and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was estimated by using the MTT assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and matrix metalloproteinase enzyme (MMP-2 and MMP-9) gene expression profiles were evaluated by using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Moreover, MMP activities and PI3K, Akt and cyclin D1 protein expression levels were evaluated by gel zymography and Western blotting, respectively. HAEF reduced HUVEC viability, with an IC50 value of 200 μg/ml. The qRT-PCR results demonstrated that treatment with HAEF markedly reduced MMP-2/MMP-9, VEGF and bFGF gene expression, as compared to the control group. We also found that MMP-2/MMP-9 enzyme activity and PI3K/Akt/cyclin D1 protein expression were notably decreased in cells treated with HAEF. Our results suggest that HAEF can potentially inhibit angiogenesis, and also affect cellular proliferation by targeting the PI3K/Akt/cyclin D1 pathway. Thus, fenugreek seed extract merits further investigation as a source of compounds with anti-cancer properties.",

Fenugreek's flavor is the primary reason for its applications in the food industry. At the same time, it has antimicrobial, antibacterial, hepatoprotection, anticancer, lactation, and antidiabetic effects. Phytochemicals responsible for these effects include galactomannans, saponins, alkaloids, and polyphenols. Besides, data showed that emerging technologies boost fenugreek extracts' yield and biological activity. Among these, ultrasound (55.6%) is the most studied technology, followed by microwave (37.0%), cold plasma (3.7%), and combined approaches (3.7%). Processing conditions (e.g., treatment time and intensity) and solvent (type, ratio, and concentration) are significant parameters that affect the performance of these novel extraction technologies.

The effects of chemical fertilizer (CF), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Glomus sp.) and AMF + nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) including Azospirillum and Azotobacter (AMF + NFB) was studied on essential oil yield and compositions of Moldavian balm (Mb) (Dracocephalum moldavica L.) in sole cropping and intercropping with fenugreek (F) (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.). The experiment was conducted during 2020 and 2021 growing seasons in East Azarbayhan, Iran. The highest dry herbage yield (6132 kg ha-1) was obtained in Mb:F(4:2) and CF treatment. After sole Moldavian balm, the highest essential oil yield (15.28 kg ha-1) was obtained in Mb:F (4:2) and AMF + NFB treatment. Geranial, geranyl acetate, geraniol, neral, and nerol were the main chemical constituents of essential oil. In AMF + NFB treatments the geranial contents in intercropping patterns of Mb:F (1:1), (2:2) and (100:50), increased by 25.1, 15.5 and 34.6% compared with sole Moldavian balm. The highest LERT values were observed in Mb:F (100:50) cropping pattern in 2021 (1.70 and 1.63 for CF and AMF + NFB treatments).

The present research aimed to evaluate some physiological and molecular effects of ZnO NPs on Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) plant. RESULTS: The ZnO NPs were applied at five different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/l) via soaking fenugreek seeds for 24 h. Fenugreek seedlings were harvested after 14 days for biomass and biochemical analyses. The results revealed that increasing ZnO NPs concentration led to a significant increase in all measured parameters until peaked at 30 mg/l; after that, a decline trend was detected. However, malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly just at higher concentrations of ZnO NPs (40 and 50 mg/l). In addition, genetic variation measure using start codon targeted (SCoT) markers revealed that ZnO NP treatments exhibited limited genetic variation. CONCLUSION: Results showed that treatment with ZnO NPs at 30 mg/l can improve biomass, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of fenugreek seedlings, besides being safe for DNA. So, this concentration could be a decent nanofertilizer for fenugreek plant."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anabolic steroids (AS) are commonly abused by body builders and athletes aiming to increase their strength and muscle mass but unfortunately, the long-term use of AS may lead to serious side effects. Nandrolone Decanoate is one of the Class II anabolic androgenic steroids which quickly spread globally and used clinically and illicitly. Our research was directed to assess the toxic effects of anabolic steroids on cardiac and skeletal muscles in male albino rats and to evaluate the potential ameliorative effects of fenugreek seeds extract and silymarin. METHODS: Our research was done on 120 male albino rats that were allocated into 6 groups; group I: Served as a control group, group II: Received the anabolic steroid Nandrolone Decanoate, group III: Received silymarin orally, group IV: Received fenugreek seeds extract orally, group (V): Received the anabolic steroid Nandrolone Decanoate and silymarin and group (VI): Received the anabolic steroid Nandrolone Decanoate and fenugreek seeds extract. By the end of the study, rats were sacrificed, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis and autopsy samples for histopathological examination. RESULTS: The anabolic steroids toxic effects on rats showed a significant decrease in serum High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) level and increase in cholesterol, triglycerides, and Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) levels. There was a significant elevation in cardiac troponin I level. As regards to histopathological examination of the cardiac and skeletal muscles, the study showed marked degenerative changes and necrosis. Both silymarin and fenugreek seeds extract provided a protective effect on the biochemical and histopathological changes. The antioxidant effects of silymarin and fenugreek seeds extract were evaluated on the heart, skeletal muscles and showed that, the tissue levels of Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase and reduced glutathione (GSH) decreased in AS treated rats compared to the control group. On the other hand, the tissue Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Anabolic steroids have a toxic effect on the cardiac and skeletal muscles of albino rats with improvement by treatment with fenugreek seeds extract and silymarin.",

This study assessed the efficacy of ascaroside treatment in the control of Salmonella enterica on alfalfa and fenugreek sprouts. Sanitized commercial seeds were treated with 1 mM or 1 µM ascaroside (ascr)#18, a plant immunity modulator (PIM) and dried for an hour before being inoculated with lyophilized S. Cubana or S. Stanley cells in sandy soil (104 CFU/g). Treated and untreated seeds were spouted on 1% water agar at 25°C in the dark. Seed or sprout samples were collected on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the population of Salmonella was determined. Data were fit into the general linear arrangement, and means were separated using Fisher's least significant difference test. Seed type, strain type, treatment type, and sprouting time were significant factors (P ≤ 0.05) influencing Salmonella growth on sprouts. The populations of Salmonella were significantly higher on fenugreek than on alfalfa sprouts. S. Stanley had a significantly higher population than S. Cubana. The population of Salmonella increased from day 0 to day 3 and reached the peak population on Day 5. Treatments with both concentrations of ascaroside significantly decreased the populations of Salmonella compared to the controls. The mean Salmonella population reduction was ca. 4 or 1 log CFU/g by treatment with 1 mM and 1 µM of the PIM, respectively. Treatment with the PIM could be potentially used to improve the microbial safety of vegetable seeds and sprouts.",

      "abstract": "Household processing of fenugreek seeds and leaves, including soaking, germination, and boiling of the seeds, and air-drying of the leaves, has improved the levels of human consumption of the bitter seeds and increased the shelf life of fresh leaves, respectively. The potential anticancer activity of either unprocessed or processed fenugreek seeds or leaves and the relative expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes of the studied cancerous cell lines exposed to IC50 crude extracts was investigated to observe the apoptotic-inducing property of this plant as an anticancer agent. The protein expression of IKK-α and IKK-β, as inhibitors of NF-KB which exhibit a critical function in the regulation of genes involved in chronic inflammatory disorders, were studied in the tested cancerous cell lines. In this study, the anticancer activity of household-processed fenugreek leaves and seeds against HepG2, HCT-116, MCF-7, and VERO cell lines was measured using an MTT assay. DNA fragmentation of both HepG2 and MCF-7 was investigated by using gel electrophoresis. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the relative expression of each p53, caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 genes, whereas ELISA assay determined the expression of caspase-3, TNF-α, and 8-OHDG genes. Western blotting analyzed the protein-expressing levels of IKK-α and IKK-β proteins in each studied cell line. Data showed that at 500 µg mL-1, ADFL had the highest cytotoxicity against the HepG2 and HCT-116 cell lines. Although, each UFS and GFS sample had a more inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells than ADFL. Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the IC50 of each ADFL, UFS, and GFS sample induced DNA fragmentation in HepG2 and MCF-7, contrary to untreated cell lines. Gene expression using RT-PCR showed that IC50 doses of each sample induced apoptosis through the up-regulation of the p53, caspase-3, and Bax genes and the down-regulation of the Bcl-2 gene in each studied cell line. The relative expression of TNF-α, 8-OHDG, and caspase-3 genes of each HepG2 and MCF-7 cell line using ELISA assays demonstrated that ADFL, UFS, and GFS samples reduced the expression of TNF-α and 8-OHDG genes but increased the expression of the caspase-3 gene. Protein-expressing levels of IKK-α and IKK-β proteins in each studied cell line, determined using Western blotting, indicated that household treatments decreased IKK-α expression compared to the UFS sample. Moreover, the ADFL and SFS samples had the most activity in the IKK-β expression levels. Among all studied samples, air-dried fenugreek leaves and unprocessed and germinated fenugreek seeds had the most anti-proliferative and apoptotic-inducing properties against human HepG2, MCF-7, and HCT-116 cell lines, as compared to the VERO cell line. So, these crude extracts can be used in the future for developing new effective natural drugs for the treatment of hepatocellular, breast, and colon carcinomas."

      "abstract": "Trigonella foenum-graecum has been extensively used for centuries in traditional medicine systems for the cure of health ailments including diabetes. Improving the medicinal attributes of plants through the elicitation strategy is gaining great interest in the recent past. In the current study, an attempt is made to reveal the role and possible mechanism of action of vitamin C elicit phytochemical-rich aqueous extract of 4th day germinated IM6 genotype fenugreek sprouts in the form of lyophilized powder (IM6E) under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The IM6E demonstrated strong α-glucosidase activity (95.24 %) and moderate α-amylase and invertase inhibition activities under in vitro conditions. The High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) based analysis demonstrated that IM6E possess significantly higher concentration of phenolic phytochemical quercetin (0.148 %) as compared to diosgenin and trigonelline bioactive anti-diabetic nutraceuticals. In normal rats after loading with glucose and sucrose, the IM6E administration in a dose-dependent manner significantly reduced the post-prandial hyperglycemia, in a similar fashion as the anti-diabetic drug voglibose as evident from the area under curves (AUC) of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and oral sucrose tolerance test (OSTT) tests. The administration of IM6E in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats drastically improved the antioxidant activity of plasma in them as determined by Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) and the effect was found to be dose-dependent. The oral administration of IM6E in diabetic rats normalized almost all the deregulated biochemical markers like liver enzymes, lipids and significantly decreased higher blood glucose levels with increasing insulin levels as compared to diabetic control. The best concentration of IM6E was found to be 300 mg/kg b.w after 21 days of experimentation. The intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) in diabetic rats responded very well to IM6E treatment and 100 mg/kg.b.w. behaved almost like the administration of 0.5U insulin/kg bw, and thus indicating the insulinotropic nature of IM6E. Our findings clearly reveal the use of IM6E for diabetes management and at the same it possesses great potential when combined with voglibose to ameliorate diabetes and its associated complications to a greater extent due to synergistic effects as compared to monotherapy. However, more clinical trials need to be performed before recommending IM6E as an anti-diabetic alternative medicine."

Chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of FO revealed that linoleic acid, (E,E)-4-decadienal, and isopropyl myristate are the major constituents of FO. The results showed that treatment of S. mansoni-infected mice with 0.15 ml of FO daily for 10 successive days exhibited a significant reduction in the number of S. mansoni male worms, and coupled worms as compared to an infected control group (p < 0.05). Regarding total egg counts and oogram patterns, FO effectively reduced the percentage of hepatic and intestinal egg counts, and elevated immature and dead eggs in ratios closely to praziquantel (PZQ) treated mice. Meanwhile, FO significantly elevated the levels of glutathione and co-enzyme Q-10 (COQ-10) up to 0.33±0.02 ng/ml and 0.28±0.02 ng/ml, respectively. However, when accompanied with PZQ, COQ-10 level was closer to that of the normal control group (0.37 ± 0.021 ng/ml). The result also showed that FO significantly reduced levels of lipid per-oxidation (0.165±0.01 ng/ml) and vascular endothelial growth factor (0.25±0.02 pg/ml) as compared to the PZQ-treated group (0.234±0.02 ng/ml and 0.31±0.008 pg/ml, respectively). Moreover, FO recovered normal values of caspase-7, and when accompanied with PZQ, annexin-V was also significantly reduced. However, treatment of S. mansoni-infected mice with PZQ led to a significant increase in the level of annexin-V as compared to S. mansoni-infected mice group (p < 0.05). It can be concluded that FO may have a potential anti-schistosomal, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Also, it may have a recovering effect on apoptotic parameters toward the normal values.",

Mucilage extracted from flaxseed (FSG) and fenugreek seed (FGG) was evaluated as natural flocculants in a coagulation-flocculation (CF) process for arsenic removal, and were compared against a commercial xanthan gum (XG). Mucilage materials were characterized by spectroscopy (FT-IR, 13C NMR), point-of-zero charge (pHpzc) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Box-Behnken design (BBD) with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine optimal conditions for arsenic removal for the CF process for three independent variables: coagulant dosage, flocculant dosage and settling time. Two anionic systems were tested: S1, roxarsone (organic arsenate 50 mg L-1) at pH 7 and S2 inorganic arsenate (inorganic arsenate 50 mg L-1) at pH 7.5. Variable arsenic removal (RE, %) was achieved: 92.0 (S1-FSG), 92.3 (S1-FGG), 92.8 (S1-XG), 77.0 (S2-FSG), 69.6 (S2-FGG) and 70.6 (S2-XG) based on the BBD optimization. An in situ kinetic method was used to investigate arsenic removal, where the pseudo-first-order model accounts for the kinetic process. The FSG and FGG materials offer a sustainable alternative for the controlled removal of arsenic in water using a facile CF treatment process with good efficiency, as compared with a commercial xanthan gum."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder which accounts for infertility around the world. The disease is characterized by elevated secretion of androgens in the women which results in enlargement of ovaries with accumulation of fluid filled cysts, irregular menstrual cycles, and hirsutism. This study reports the efficacy of a patented, standardized Trigonella foenum-graecum extract (Furocyst®) as an effective phytotherapeutic for effective management of PCOS. OBJECTIVE: This randomized one-arm study assessed the efficacy of Furocyst® in 107 female volunteers over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. METHOD: Following approvals of the Institutional Ethical Committee and clinicaltrials.gov, 107 female volunteers (age: 18-45 years) were recruited. Subjects consumed Furocyst® capsules (1,000 mg/day p.o.) over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. Physical (Sonographic scan, Hirsutism Score, Menstrual cycle, Body Weight, BMI, Height, Waist Circumference and Blood Pressure) and biochemical parameters (LH/FSH ratio, TSH, Prolactin, Fasting insulin, Fasting Glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, HOMA Index, free and total testosterone, 2-hour GTT, DHEAS) were assessed at the beginning of the study as well as at intervals of 4 weeks till 12 weeks to determine the efficacy of Furocyst® on PCOS induced damage on reproductive and endocrine system. RESULTS: Furocyst® treatment induced >40% reduction of mean cyst sizes in both ovaries with corresponding reduction of in ovarian volumes. LH:FSH ratio was also significantly improved with corresponding reduction in total testosterone and prolactin levels. As a result of improvement in endocrine function, menstrual cycle became regular in the subjects. Furocyst® also reduced the severity of other associated ailments such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and improved liver function significantly. CONCLUSIONS: This study reinstated the efficacy of Furocyst® as a safe phytotherapeutic to reverse the effects of PCOS inflicted damage on the female reproductive system without any adverse events."

      "abstract": "The use of fenugreek seed as a galactagogue has been investigated in ruminants. However, only a few studies have analyzed the effects of fenugreek seed on the milk fatty acid composition. To the authors' best knowledge, none of these studies have investigated the effects of fenugreek seed on milk volatile compounds. The objective of this study, which lasted 8 weeks, was to determine the effects of fenugreek seed supplementation on the performance, milk fatty acid profile, and milk volatile profile of goats. A total of 20 Turkish Saanen dairy goats that were mid-lactation were used in the study. This study was carried out with two homogeneous groups: the control group (CON) and fenugreek group (FG). Both groups were fed a total mixed ration (TMR), but the FG treatment had their diet supplemented with 0.1 kg d  - 1   of fenugreek seed per animal. The feed intake, live weight, milk yield, milk chemical composition, serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentration, milk fatty acid profile, and milk volatile compound profile were determined. The feed intake, live weight gain, and milk yield of the goats did not significantly differ between the CON and FG treatments ( P > 0.05  ), whereas the milk fat concentration increased ( P = 0.05  ) and the serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations decreased ( P < 0.05  ) in the FG treatment. The unsaturated fatty acid concentration in milk ( P < 0.05  ) was also enhanced in the FG treatment. In addition, the FG treatment increased 2-propanone, 2-butanone, benzene, 1-methyl-3-(1-methylethyl), and eucalyptol concentrations in milk ( P < 0.05  ). In conclusion, the supplementation of goats' diets with fenugreek seed during the mid-lactation period did not affect their performance and improved the unsaturated fatty acid profile of their milk. Of particular importance, we have also detected an increase in the 2-propanone concentration in milk following fenugreek supplementation."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Trigonella foenum-graecum L. (fenugreek) is widely used as a leafy vegetable and spice in China and North Africa. Recent studies have reported that fenugreek can reduce fatigue; however, its antifatigue mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential antifatigue effects of fenugreek extract (FE) on mitophagy and the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the potential effects of FE tablet on an exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue (EEF) rat model. Oxidative stress indicators and fatigue biomarkers in the serum and skeletal muscle were detected. Mitophagy and mitochondrial morphology were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of mitochondrial autophagy-related proteins were detected using western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, FE enhanced the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase as well as total antioxidant capacity; however, it decreased the level of malondialdehyde in the serum and skeletal muscle after a 7-day treatment. Moreover, certain indicators of mitochondrial function, such as reactive oxygen species levels, ATP levels, cellular and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, and ATPase activity, were significantly improved in the FE group compared with the model group. Finally, we found that mitophagy was induced by exhaustive exercise and inhibited by FE. Regarding mitochondrial autophagy-related proteins, the expression levels of LC3B, FUNDC1, PGAM5, PARKIN, and PINK1 in the skeletal muscle tissue were increased in the EEF group compared with the control group. After administration of FE and a positive control drug, a significant reversal in the expression of the above-mentioned proteins was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that FE exerted antifatigue effects in the EEF rat model by regulating the mitophagy-related FUNDC1/LC3B signaling pathway rather than the PINK1/PARKIN signaling pathway.",

It has been hypothesized that consumption of products with known antioxidant properties would help combat factors associated with both intrinsic and extrinsic aging factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the formulation Blue Fenugreek Kale Extract (BFKE) on skin aging. METHODS: In this study, the effect of BFKE on protein oxidation was determined in human dermal fibroblasts by analysis of the level of protein carbonylation after cells were stressed with either H2O2 or urban pollution consisting of particulate matter and UV-A. Furthermore, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study that evaluated the effect of BFKE consumption over a period of 56 days in 59 volunteers was performed. The major parameter studied was skin barrier dysfunction through the assessment of Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL). Additional parameters analyzed clinically include skin moisture content, participant self-assessment of skin parameters, wrinkle severity, skin sagging and elasticity. Furthermore, low grade and allergic inflammatory biomarker levels were measured at the start and end of the treatment period, along with oxidative stress assessment using blood malondialdehyde levels. RESULTS: BFKE significantly reduced protein carbonylation in human dermal fibroblasts stressed with urban pollution. In the clinical study, the TEWL level reduced significantly and at the same time the skin moisture content levels increased by end of the treatment period. No significant changes were observed in wrinkle severity, skin sagging, elasticity, inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarker levels. Participant and investigator perception of treatment was significantly greater after product consumption, as was the improvement in skin parameters based on participant self-assessment. CONCLUSION: BFKE reduces protein oxidation induced by H2O2 and restores skin barrier function and skin hydration, while also combating early signs of aging."

      "abstract": "Soil receiving discharges from Pb-acid batteries dismantling and restoring units (PBS) can have a high concentration of phytoavailable Pb. Reducing Pb phytoavailability in PBS can decline Pb uptake in food crops and minimize the risks to humans and the environment. This pot study aimed to reduce the concentration of phytoavailable Pb in PBS through Aspergillus niger (A. niger)-mediated release of PO43- from fish bone [Apatite II (APII)] products. The PBS (Pb = 639 mg kg-1 soil) was amended with APII powder (APII-P), APII char (APII-C), and A. niger inoculum as separate doses, and combining A. niger with APII-P (APII-P + A. niger) and APII-C (APII-C + A. niger). The effects of these treatments on reducing the phytoavailability of Pb in PBS and its uptake in fenugreek were examined. Additionally, enzymatic activities and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in the PBS and the indices of plant physiology, nutrition, and antioxidant defense machinery were scoped. Results revealed that the APII-C + A. niger treatment was the most efficient one. Compared to the control, it significantly reduced the Pb phytoavailability (DTPA-extractable Pb fraction) in soil and its uptake in plant shoots, roots, and grain, up to 61%, 83%, 74%, and 92%. The grain produced under APII-C + A. niger were safe for human consumption as Pb concentration in grain was 4.01 mg kg-1 DW, remaining within the permissible limit set by WHO/FAO (2007). The APII-C + A. niger treatment also improved soil pH, EC, CEC, MBC, available P content and enzymatic activities, and the fenugreek quality parameters. A. niger played a significant role in solubilizing PO43- from APII-C, which reacted with Pb and formed insoluble Pb-phosphates, thereby reducing Pb phytoavailability in PBS and its uptake in plants. This study suggests APII-C + A. niger can remediate Pb-polluted soils via reducing Pb phytoavailability in them.",

      "abstract": "Salinity-induced stress is widely considered a main plant-growth-limiting factor. The positive effects of melatonin in modulating abiotic stresses have led this hormone to be referred to as a growth regulator in plants. This study aims to show how melatonin protects fenugreek against the negative effects of salt stress. Different amounts of melatonin (30, 60, and 90 ppm), salinity stress (150 mM and 300 mM), and the use of both salinity and melatonin were used as treatments. The results showed that applying different melatonin levels to salinity-treated fenugreek plants effectively prevented the degradation of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents compared with salinity treatment without melatonin application. Besides, melatonin increases the biosynthesis of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, thereby adjusting the content of reactive oxygen species, free radicals, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde content. It was observed that applying melatonin increased the activity of potassium-carrying channels leading to the maintenance of ionic homeostasis and increased intracellular water content under salinity stress. The results revealed that melatonin activates the defense signaling pathways in fenugreek through the nitric oxide, auxin, and abscisic acid-dependent pathways. Melatonin, in a similar vein, increased the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis pathway of diosgenin, a highly important steroidal sapogenin in medical and food industries, and hence the diosgenin content. When 150 mM salinity stress and 60 ppm melatonin were coupled, the diosgenin concentration rose by more than 5.5 times compared to the control condition. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the potential of melatonin to enhance the plant tolerance to salinity stress by stimulating biochemical and physiological changes."

Due to the importance of using alternative therapies in managing symptoms of this disease, the present study was designed and conducted to investigate the effect of co-supplementation of berberine and fenugreek in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 50 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Participants were randomized in the intervention group, which received 3 capsules/day of 500 mg (300 mg of berberine + 200 mg of fenugreek seed powder) or placebo for 12 weeks. Biochemical and anthropometric variables were measured at the beginning and end of the study. RESULTS: We observed that fasting insulin, HbA1C, and hs-CRP significantly decreased in the intervention group compared to the baseline. The mean difference in insulin resistance (-0.32 vs. 0.15), fasting blood sugar (-14.40 vs. 1.68), and fasting insulin (- 2.18 vs. 1.34) were clinically significant in comparison to the control group. Almost all domains of SF-12 scores were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of berberine and fenugreek seed can improve cardio-metabolic status in patients with diabetes and support the anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory role of herb in the improvement of quality of life."

Non-diabetic and diabetic rats received the normal saline as a vehicle or were treated with FS-EA or F-GAL at a final concentration of 500 mg/kg/each. Treatments with both drugs reduced fasting hyperglycemia and improved serum and hepatic lipid profiles in the control and diabetic rats. Additionally, F-GAL and FS-AE attenuated the associated reduction in the mass and structure of the islets of Langerhans in diabetic rats and improved the structure of the kidneys and livers. In association, they also reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxides, factor (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nuclear levels of NF-κB p65, and improved serum levels of ALT, AST, albumin, and creatinine. However, both treatments increased hepatic and renal superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the livers and kidneys of both the control and diabetic-treated rats, which coincided with a significant increase in transcription, translation, and nuclear localization of Nrf2. In conclusion, FS-AE and F-GAL are effective therapeutic options that may afford a possible treatment for T1DM by attenuating pancreatic damage, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic and renal damage."

      "abstract": "In order to study the regulation of Fenugreek seed extract (FSE) on the immunity of broilers, and explore the appropriate amount of FSE in broilers' production, 1-day-old yellow feather broilers with a total of 420 birds were randomly allocated into seven treatments. Each treatment had six replicates, with 10 birds per replicate. The two control groups were the basic fodder group fed with basal diet and the bacitracin zinc group added 30 mg/kg bacitracin zinc to the basal diet. Experimental groups included five levels of FSE (50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg FSE to the basal diet, respectively). The pre-test period was 7 days and the formal test lasted for 56 days. The results showed that the average daily gain (ADG) of 50 and 800 mg/kg FSE groups was significantly increased (P < 0.01), and the feed to gain ratio (F/G) of FSE groups was significantly decreased (P < 0.01) compared with the basic fodder and the bacitracin zinc groups. Compared with the basic fodder group, the serum total cholesterol (TC) content in the FSE groups was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), the serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) content of 50, 100, and 800 mg/kg FSE groups was significantly lower than that of the basic fodder group (P < 0.05). Compared with the basic fodder and bacitracin zinc groups, the serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) content of 100 and 200 mg/kg FSE groups were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with the bacitracin zinc group, the serum interleukins (IL-1, IL-10) content of 400 mg/kg FSE group were significantly increased (P ≤ 0.05), and the serum interferon-γ (IFN-γ) content of 100 and 200 mg/kg FSE groups was significantly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with the basic fodder group, the lower doses (0-400 mg/kg) of FSE had no significant effect on the mRNA expression of toll-like receptors 4/ myeloid differentiation factor 88/ nuclear factor-κB (TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB) signaling pathways (P > 0.05). The 800 mg/kg FSE treatment group significantly increased the expression levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) mRNA in the spleen of broilers (P < 0.05). The zinc bacitracin group significantly increased the expression levels of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) mRNA (P ≤ 0.05). The results showed that FSE could promote the secretion of immunoglobulins, regulate the body's cytokines, and have a positive effect on immunity in broilers. Furthermore, the recommended supplement of FSE is 100 mg/kg in the broiler diet."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Herbal galactagogues are usually recommended to be sweetened with honey. Despite the high nutritious value of honey for lactating women and extensive studies on the effects of herbal galactagogues, no investigation was made to compare galactagogue effects of using herbal galactagogues with and without honey so far. The present study aimed to compare the effect of a combination of \"honey and fenugreek\" with \"fenugreek\" on breastfeeding success (BFS). METHODS: This study is a triple-blind randomized clinical trial on 75 breastfeeding mothers referred to a Tehran-Iran health center. The participants were randomly divided into two intervention (fenugreek and honey users) and control (fenugreek users) groups. These women had infants of 1-5 months and had exclusive breastfeeding practice. Tools for data collection were (1) the personal and maternal-infant information, (2) the breastfeeding success, and (3) the complications questionnaires. Participants received 30 liquid drops, three times daily for four weeks. The BFS questionnaire was completed twice, before and 4 weeks after the intervention. The CONSORT checklist was followed. RESULTS: Before and after comparison showed no significant difference in the BFS score in the \"fenugreek\" group, while there was a significant increase in the BFS score in the \"honey and fenugreek\" group (P=0.035). Between groups, comparison demonstrated a significantly higher score of BFS in the intervention group than in the control group (P=0.023). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the possible complications. CONCLUSION: The combination of honey with fenugreek showed a significant effect on BFS, while there was no improvement in BFS after fenugreek only uses. Trial registration: the study was approved in the Iranian registry of clinical trials with IRCT ID: IRCT20120122008801N23 on 2019-12-30 (https://www.irct.ir/)."

      "abstract": "The present study investigated the main components of fenugreek(Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) leaf flavonoids(FLFs) and their antioxidant activity. FLFs were prepared and enriched by solvent extraction, and the flavonoids were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry(HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). The protective effect of FLFs against H_2O_2-induced stress damage to L02 hepatocytes was also investigated. Firstly, the cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The oxidative stress injury model was induced by H_2O_2 in L02 cells. The release of lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), the content of reduced glutathione(GSH) and malondialdehyde(MDA), and the activities of superoxide dismutase(SOD) and catalase(CAT) were measured by assay kits. Hoechst fluorescence staining was performed to observe the cell apoptosis. The expression levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2(ERK1/2), nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2(Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1(HO-1), and their phosphorylated proteins were detected by Western blot. Based on the MS fragment ion information and data in databases, FLFs contained eight flavonoids with quercetin and kaempferol as the main aglycons. The cell viabi-lity assay revealed that as compared with the conditions in the H_2O_2 treatment group, 3.125-25 μg·mL~(-1) FLFs could increase the viability of L02 cells, reduce LDH release and MDA content in a dose-dependent manner, potentiate the activities of SOD, CAT, and GSH, decrease the phosphorylation of JNK and ERK1/2 proteins, and up-regulate the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. The results of fluorescence staining showed that the nucleus of the H_2O_2 treatment group showed concentrated and dense strong blue fluorescence, while the blue fluorescence intensity of the FLFs group decreased significantly. FLFs showed a protective effect against H_2O_2-induced oxidative damage in L02 cells, and the underlying mechanism is associated with the enhancement of cell capability in clearing oxygen free radicals and the inhibition of apoptosis by the activation of the MAPKs/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. The antioxidant effect of fenugreek leaf is related to its rich flavonoids.",

Saponins extracted from many plants exhibit multiple biological actions such as anti-cancer effects. Therefore, the possible protective effect of fenugreek saponin (FS) and nanofenugreek saponin (NFS) against nicotine-induced toxicity in male rats was investigated in this study. Animals were divided into a control group and the nicotine (1.5 mg/kg/day), FS (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day), or/and NFS (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day) administered groups. Micronucleus assay, histopathological, and sperm abnormality examinations as well as measurement of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene expression were conducted. Our findings revealed that nicotine treatment induced significant increases in the incidence of micronucleus, sperm abnormalities, and expression levels of AChE in addition to inducing histopathological changes in rat testis. On the other hand, administration of FS or NFS with nicotine significantly decreased the incidence of micronuclei and the percentage of sperm abnormalities as well as the expression levels of AChE gene. Moreover, nicotine-induced histological alterations were reduced by given FS or NFS with nicotine. In conclusion, nicotine-induced sperm abnormalities, chromosomal damage, and histological injuries were mitigated by administration of FS or NFS with nicotine, and thus, FS and NFS could be used as ameliorating agents against nicotine toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Hepatic-related diseases, in particular hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia, are a thorn on the side of the national health institutes around the globe. Indeed, liver lipid and cholesterol dysregulation could lead to atherosclerotic plaque formation and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, statin administration and monacolin K consumption are the main therapies proposed to counter this alarming connection, but relevant side effects are known. To overcome this issue, safe nutraceutical formulations and/or vegetal extracts, endowed with anticholesterolemic activity, could be instrumental in hypercholesterolemia prevention and treatment. In the present work, the anticholesterolemic efficacy of three vegetal extracts used in traditional medicine (artichoke, caigua, and fenugreek), their unique blend (ACFB), and the monacolin K-containing red yeast extract (RYR), was investigated with an in vitro approach based on hepatic cell line HepG2. The impact on cholesterol of the three extracts, their blend, and RYR were investigated by determining hepatocyte total and free cholesterol and bile acids biosynthesis. According to our results, the anticholesterolemic activity of the vegetal extracts was confirmed, and a novel choleretic activity of caigua extract was evidenced. ACFB showed to be safer than RYR while showing a similar effect on total and free cholesterol and bile acids synthesis compared to it. The anticholesterolemic activity of the blend was obtained with lower vegetal extract concentrations compared with the single vegetal extract, potentially indicating an additive effect between the extracts. In conclusion, the vegetal extracts and their blend, ACFB, are safe and are endowed with anticholesterolemic activity, potentially providing complementary therapies to the statin-based ones for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia-related complications."

      "abstract": "The intention to conduct this study was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of Fenugreek seeds' extract supplementation in thioacetamide induced liver damage in male Sprague Dawley rats. For this study, 24 male Sprague Dawley rats (200-264gm) were distributed randomly into four groups. Group I remained untreated as control rats, group II received thioacetamide (200mg/Kg b.w i.p, administered on alternative days for 8 weeks), group III received thioacetamide (200mg/Kg b.w i.p administered on alternative days for 8 weeks) as well as 2ml of 2% extract of fenugreek seeds (orally administered daily from 4th week till 8th week of the experiment. Group IV only received 2ml of 2% extract of Fenugreek seeds daily for 4 weeks respectively. At the end of the experiment, blood was sampled to obtain plasma that was used for the analysis of liver markers and liver was used for analysis of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and SOD). Increase in total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALT and ALP levels, catalase activity and decrease in SOD activity was found in TAA-treated groups which assured liver damage. Whereas, treatment with Fenugreek seeds extract restored the altered levels of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALT, ALP, catalase and SOD activities in the Test + Supp group. The results of this study confirmed the hepatoprotective role of Fenugreek seeds extract in thioacetamide induced liver damage.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic cancer is one of the malignant tumors in the digestive system all over the world. It has a very low survival rate. Although there is a great advancement in its therapy either through radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or other therapies, the overall survival is still less than 24 months. Another problem for pancreatic cancer is the resistance to its conventional chemotherapy (e.g., gemcitabine). From this point of view, there is an urgent need to find an effective drug treatment METHODS: The anticancer activity of the germinated fenugreek seed extract is examined in vitro and in vivo against BXPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Two groups of albino mice were injected with BXPC-3 cells: the first group remained non-treated and the second group was injected with IC50 of the fenugreek extract. The body weight and the survival rate were observed in the two groups and histological examination of the pancreatic tissue was observed RESULTS: Germinated fenugreek seed extract can be efficiently maximized the survival rate in pancreatic cancer mice and protect the pancreatic tissue from lesions related to cancer. CONCLUSION: Germinated fenugreek seed extract can be used to fight pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract": "The use of chitosan as an alternative for fungicides has received more attention worldwide. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of chitosan against Fusarium solani causing root rot in fenugreek. Chitosan treatments ranged from 0.1 to 2gL-1 were tested against F. solani on to potato dextrose agar and in potato dextrose broth. The results revealed that increase in concentrations of chitosan significantly reduced growth, dried biomass, sporulation and spore germination of F. solani. The hyphal swellings and distortion of F. solani mycelia were induced by chitosan. Fenugreek seeds treated with chitosan at 2 gL-1 and 0.5 gL-1 showed reduced F. solani infection and increased seed germination, respectively. In pot and field studies, fenugreek seeds treated with chitosan at 2.0 gL-1 greatly reduced root rot disease severity and also enhanced yield parameters. The activity of defence enzymes, such as chitinase, β-1, 3-glucanase and total phenol were increased in chitosan treated in fenugreek plants. This increased activity offered protection to fenugreek plants against F. solani to a greater extent. The results showed that chitosan could be used as inducer of defense response and has the potential of controlling fenugreek root rot disease."

The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer potential of methanolic fenugreek seed extract (FSE) and its possible molecular mechanism of action in breast cancer cells. METHODS: The anticancer potential of FSE was evaluated in MCF-7 and SK-BR3 breast cancer cells through various cellular assays after selecting the IC10, IC25, IC35, and IC50 doses by the cell cytotoxicity assay. Furthermore, the oral acute toxicity of FSE was examined in mice, according to the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). RESULTS: FSE exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, as the IC50 was found to be 150 and 40 μg/mL for MCF-7 and SK-BR3 breast cancer cells, respectively. The cytological observations showed the typical apoptotic morphology in both of the breast cancer cells upon treatment with FSE, as it inhibited the migration and adhesion, in a dose-dependent manner. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that FSE induced a significant shift from G2/M, and polyploidy (>G) at higher concentrations that suggested the activation of p53-mediated mitotic catastrophe, consequently leading to apoptosis. FSE induced a significant increase in the mitochondrial depolarization, ROS as well as a Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and also exhibited the mitochondrial associated p53 signaling pathway. The in vivo acute toxicity data revealed that the oral administration of FSE did not induce any toxic effect in mice. CONCLUSION: This study, for the first time, reports the mechanistic details of the anti-cancer potential of FSE. It requires a detailed analysis to understand the effect of FSE to induce the apoptosis through the multiple signaling pathways at varying concentrations. The nontoxic effect of FSE in mice suggests to utilize it safely for pharmaceutical formulations in different cancer systems."

The present investigation aimed to evaluate the possible mechanism of action of vitexin on obesity-induced DN in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed experimental C57BL/6 mice model. Obesity was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by chronic administration of HFD, and mice were concomitantly treated with vitexin (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg, p.o.). HFD-induced increased renal oxido-nitrosative stress and proinflammatory cytokine levels were significantly inhibited by vitexin. The Western blot analysis suggested that alteration in renal NF-κB, IκBα, nephrin, AMPK, and ACC phosphorylation levels was effectively restored by vitexin treatment. Histological aberration induced in renal tissue after chronic administration of HFD was also reduced by vitexin. In conclusion, vitexin suppressed the progression of obesity-induced DN via modulation of NF-κB/IkBα and AMPK/ACC pathways in an experimental model of HFD-induced DN in C57BL/6J mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fenugreek seeds host various bioactive compounds, and galactomannan (GM) is a significant soluble fibre. In this study, selective extraction is adapted to extract fenugreek seed GM to improvise the yield recovery. The seeds are fractionated, separated and classified as husk and cotyledons. Comparative studies have been performed to evaluate the crude and pure GM yield between different groups such as the whole seed, and the classified fractions. Characterization is done using Fourier transform infrared, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, monosaccharide composition and optical density, and the structure is elucidated through nuclear magnetic resonance. The GM obtained through extraction is used to study its enzyme inhibitory property associated with hyperglycaemia. RESULTS: GM yield extracted from the husk is highly significant compared to other groups. Crude GM and pure GM yield was 2 and 3.25 times higher than that obtained through whole seed samples. The characterization of the pure GM is on a par with the existing reports. The purified GM inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes in vitro, with an IC50 of 21.08 ± 0.085 and 67.17 ± 5.15 μg mL-1 , respectively. CONCLUSION: Selective extraction prompts enhancement in the recovery of the bioactive compound, minimal use of resources, and promotes industrial viability. Characterization of the compound confirms the structure. Its enzyme inhibitory property makes GM a valuable compound in diabetic prevention/treatment. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",

METHODS: Forty-five untrained men and women were randomly assigned to one of three supplementation groups: placebo (PLA, n = 13), 500 mg·day-1 CurQfen® (CUR, n = 14), or 300 mg·day-1 fenugreek soluble fiber (FEN, n = 18). Participants completed a maximal graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer to determine the VT and V ˙ O2 peak before (PRE) and after (POST) 28 days of daily supplementation. Separate, one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to examine the between-group differences for adjusted POST VT and V ˙ O2 peak values, covaried for the respective PRE-test values. RESULTS: The adjusted POST VT V ˙ O2 values for the CUR (mean ± SD = 1.593 ± 0.157 L·min-1) and FEN (1.597 ± 0.157 L·min-1) groups were greater than (p = 0.039 and p = 0.025, respectively) the PLA (1.465 ± 0.155 L·min-1) group, but the FEN and CUR groups were not different (p = 0.943). There were no differences in the adjusted V ˙ O2 peak values (F = 0.613, p = 0.547) among groups. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that fenugreek soluble fiber was responsible for the improvements in the submaximal performance index for both CUR and FEN groups."

Inoculation effects with selected bacteria were investigated firstly on fenugreek plants under greenhouse experiment and secondly on intercropped fenugreek and barley under three different agro-environmental conditions for two consecutive years. Sinorhizobium meliloti F42 was selected due to its ability to nodulate fenugreek and effectively improve plant growth. Among non-nodulating endophytic bacteria, Variovorax paradoxus F310 strain was selected regarding its plant growth-promoting traits showed in vitro and confirmed in vivo under greenhouse experiment. Field inoculation trials revealed a significant improvement in fenugreek nodulation (up to + 97%) as well as in soil enzymes activities (up to + 209%), shoot N content (up to + 18%), shoot dry weight (up to + 40%), photosynthetic assimilation (up to + 34%) and chlorophyll content of both intercropped plants in response to the mono-inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti F42, compared to the un-inoculated treatment at the SBR and JBS sites. Variovorax paradoxus F310 inoculation significantly increased shoot P content of both intercropped plants at the three experimental sites compared to the un-inoculated treatment (up to + 48%). It was shown that bacterial inoculation was more efficient at the low-rainfall region than the high-rainfall region. The co-inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti F42 and Variovorax paradoxus F310 resulted in a significant reduction in fenugreek nodulation and shoot N content. This survey showed the benefits of rhizobial and PGPR inoculation as efficient bio-inoculums to promote the cereal-legume intercropping system and highlights the influence of site-specific environmental factors on Rhizobium-PGPR-plant interactions.",

      "abstract": "Fenugreek seeds have widespread relations with Ayurveda, Unani, and Arabic medicine. The seeds were useful for the treatment and prevention of different ailments. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) or methi is from the Leguminosae family and are primarily known for its anti-diabetic and hypocholesterolemic activities. The germinated fenugreek seeds were used in the treatment of E.coli infection in Germany and France. The important phytoconstituents responsible for such medicinal applications are saponins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, galactomannans, trigonelline, and 4-hydroxy isoleucine. Flavonoids, apigenin 6,8-di-C-glucoside, apigenin-6-C-glucosyl-8-C-galactoside, 6-Cgalactosyl- 8-C-arabinoside are the chief ingredients of fenugreek seeds; responsible for reducing blood glucose while given to diabetic rats, whereas important flavones are epigenin, luteolin and vitexin. The other major bioactive components in fenugreek seeds are polyphenols like rhaponticin and isovitexin. Fenugreek seeds contain phosphorus and are categorized into different classes such as inorganic phosphorus, phospholipids, phytates, phosphor-proteins, and nucleic acid. Germinated seeds profusely filled with amino acids with amino acids, proteins, ascorbic acid, sugars. Further, this review shares information about the recent therapeutic intervention not covered earlier; on in vivo and in vitro and some clinical applications against certain interesting ailments other than older applications. This review includes certain nano delivery systems of Fenugreek seeds and their medicinal application.",

In this study, we applied high voltage atmospheric cold plasma (HVACP) as a pretreatment and investigated its effects on galactomannan extraction from dry fenugreek seeds and soaked seeds in NaCl solution, as well as its physicochemical properties. Results showed that HVACP treatment with air at 80 kV for 30 min caused apparent structural disruption on fenugreek seed surface and decreased the pH of extracting solution, resulting in increased galactomannan extraction yields, by 122% from soaked seeds and 67% from dry seeds. Galactomannan treated with HVACP had higher water-binding capacity, swelling index and viscosity, as well as lower melting enthalpy. HVACP treatment also altered the surface morphology of galactomannan due to plasma etching, but no significant changes in its molecular and crystalline structures were observed. The findings of this study prove that HVACP can be a green approach, in terms of reduced chemical use, to effectively enhance the extraction efficiency of fenugreek galactomannan and modify its functional properties, hence facilitate more diverse applications in both food and polymer industries.",

In the present study, response of two PGPR (PS2-KX650178 and PS10-KX650179) along with nanozeolite and nanochitosan was studied on Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), on the basis of physiological and biochemical parameters of soil and plant in pot experiment for 45 days. A significant increase (1.5-2 folds) in plant height, leaf number, leaf area and fresh weight over control was observed in Fenugreek plants when treated with nanocompounds and PGPR. Combined treatment also showed the highest level of total chlorophyll (3.27 mg g-1), sugar (6.14 μg mg-1 dry wt), soluble leaf protein (295.37 mg g-1 fresh weight) and catalase activity (23.84 U g-1 tissue) in Fenugreek plants. GC-MS analysis of plant metabolites revealed the abundance of phenols which are known to improve biotic/abiotic stresses in plants. Activity of Fluorescein Diacetate hydrolase enzyme was 2.5 times higher in the combined treatment of nanozeolite with PS10 than in control. An increase of 11% in alkaline phosphatase activity was observed in the same treatment with respect to control. The results obtained from the pot experiment clearly indicate that nanocompounds along with PGPR improved the growth of plants and soil health which suggest their benefits in agriculture practices to increase crop production."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Menopause forms one-third of women's lives. During this period, many women continue their sexual activities. One of the most prevalent postmenopausal complications is vaginal atrophy whose symptoms could have destructive effects on the life quality among postmenopausal women. Complications of using estrogen hormone to improve these symptoms are inevitable. One of the objectives of the present study is the assessment of the vaginal cream of Fenugreek on vaginal inflammation of atrophic vaginitis in postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For assessment of the effect of fenugreek vaginal cream among postmenopausal women who suffer from vaginal atrophy, the present study was carried out in the form of a double-blind clinical trial among sixty postmenopausal women, mainly who had been referred to Health Center 1 located in the east of Ahvaz in 2017. All participants of the present study who were diagnosed with vaginal atrophy were assigned into two groups of 30 randomly. One of these groups received placebo and the other one fenugreek 5% vaginal cream for a period of 8 weeks. Symptoms related to vaginal atrophy were investigated by means of a 4-degree scale (none, mild, moderate, and severe) and maturation vaginal index (MVI) through preparing the vaginal smears technique at baseline and a period of 8 weeks after cytology and intervention experiment. Finally, the process of analyzing statistical data, at a statistical significance level of 0.05, was carried out by means of SPSS Software. RESULTS: The results of the present study demonstrated that the fenugreek vaginal cream treatment group experienced a significant improvement in vaginal atrophy symptoms compared to the onset of the study (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Fenugreek vaginal cream was effective in treating vaginal atrophy; therefore, postmenopausal women are recommended to use this cream instead of synthetic estrogen to reduce the complications of this hormone."

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading causes of mortality across the world. Some earlier studies have revealed the beneficial effects of fenugreek on the risk factors for CVDs. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis is needed to clarify its effectiveness. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of fenugreek on several cardiometabolic risk factors in adult populations. Four electronic databases including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched from 2000 to 31 July 2019 to identify studies with English language. Controlled clinical trials on fenugreek reported at least one of cardiometabolic risk factors was included. Pooled effect sizes were reported as Weighted Mean Differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Trials were pooled using a random effect model with DerSimonian and Laird method. Finally, out of 2738 publications, 12 articles were included in the meta-analysis. We found that fenugreek seed vs. placebo can reduce FBS (WMD: -12.94 mg/dL, 95%CI: -21.39 mg/dL, -4.49; I2: 85.0%, p heterogeneity = 0.0001), HbA1c (WMD: -0.58%%, 95% CI: -0.99, -0.17%; I2:0%, p heterogeneity =0.61), total cholesterol (WMD:-9.13 mg/dL, 95% CI: -13.83, -4.43; I2:0, p heterogeneity = 0.48), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD:-11.11 mg/dL, 95% CI: -20.32, -1.90; I2:1.41%, p heterogeneity = 0.36). However, no significant changes were observed in other cardiometabolic parameters. Fenugreek seed as an adjuvant therapy may reduce serum levels of FBS, LDL-C and HbA1c. However, due to high heterogeneity in glycemic status, findings must be interpreted with great caution. More placebo-controlled clinical trials are warranted to further assess the effectiveness of fenugreek as a complementary therapy to control cardio-metabolic risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment due to natural or surgical menopause is always associated with estrogen deficiency leading to reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Reduced BDNF levels in menopause affect neuronal maturation, survival, axonal and dendritic arborization and the maintenance of dendritic spine density. Conventional long-term estrogen replacement therapy reported causing the risk of venous thromboembolism and breast cancer. To overcome these undesirable effects, phytoestrogens have been used in menopause-induced condition without the risk of side effects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation of fenugreek seed extract (FG) either alone or in combination with choline-DHA on BDNF and dendritic arborization of pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in ovariectomized rats. Female Wistar rats of 9-10 months old were divided into six groups as normal control (NC); ovariectomy (OVX); OVX + FG; OVX + choline-DHA; OVX + FG + choline-DHA; and OVX + estradiol. All the groups, except NC, were ovariectomized. After 2 weeks of ovariectomy, dietary supplementation was initiated for a period of 30 days. After supplementation, behavioral studies, BDNF levels and dendritic arborization were estimated. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats showed reduced BDNF levels, dendritic branching points and dendritic intersections of pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. OVX rats supplemented with FG with choline-DHA showed significantly improved BDNF levels, dendritic branching points and dendritic intersections. These results are demonstrating that FG with choline-DHA supplementation can be an alternative for estrogen replacement therapy to modulate menopause-induced learning and memory deficits.",

Patients with this syndrome are at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The Trigonella foenum-graecum L. (fenugreek) plant has many therapeutic effects, including anti-diabetic and antioxidant. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the hydro-alcoholic extract of fenugreek seeds (HEFS) on dyslipidemia and oxidative stress due to high-fructose diet-induced MetS. METHODS: In this experimental study, to induce MetS, animals received water containing 20% fructose for 8 weeks. After induction of MetS, 48 male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were randomized into six groups. HEFS was administered to animals at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg orally for 4 weeks. Animal blood samples were collected to measure biochemical and antioxidant parameters of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). RESULTS: The findings showed that the serum levels of FPG, TC, LDL-C, TG, and MDA were significantly reduced in HEFS-exposed groups compared with the control group (P<0.05). Also, significant increases in HDL-C, GPX, CAT, and TAC levels (P<0.05) were observed. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that treatment with HEFS increases the levels of antioxidant enzymes, decreases FPG level, and at the same time, modifies the lipid profile in MetS. Therefore, HEFS may help to alleviate the risk of some chronic complications of this disease."

      "abstract": "Recently, there is an increasing demand for functional yoghurts by consumer, especially those produced through the incorporation of food of plant origin or its bioactive components. The current research was devoted to formulating functional buffalo yoghurt through the addition of 0.1 and 0.2% of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seed flour (F1 and F2) and Moringa oleifera seed flour (M1 and M2). The effects of fortification were evaluated on physicochemical, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity (AOA), the viability of yoghurt starter, and sensory acceptability of yoghurts during cold storage. Moringa oleifera seed flour had higher contents of TPC (140.12 mg GAE/g) and AOA (31.30%) as compared to fenugreek seed flour (47.4 mg GAE/g and 19.1%, respectively). Values of TPC and AOA significantly increased in fortified yoghurts, and M2 treatment had the highest values of TPC (31.61, 27.29, and 25.69 mg GAE/g) and AOA (89.32, 83.5, and 80.35%) at 1, 7, and 14 days of storage, respectively. M2 showed significantly higher antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. and the zones of inhibition were 12.65, 13.14, 17.23 and 14.49 mm, respectively. On the other hand, control yoghurt showed the lowest antibacterial activity and the zones of inhibition were (4.12, 5.21, 8.55, and 8.39 mm against E. coli, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp., respectively). Incorporation of 0.1% and 0.2% of moringa seed flour (M1 and M2) led to a higher content of Ca, P, K, and Fe and lower content of Mg and Zn as compared to F1 and F2, respectively. Thus, it could be concluded that fenugreek and Moringa oleifera seed flour can be exploited in the preparation of functional novel yoghurt."

In the present study, we further investigate the effects and mechanisms of fenugreek on obesity-induced inflammation and insulin signaling in the high-fat diet (HFD)-challenged obese mice. MAIN METHODS: After 12 weeks of HFD intervention, mice were treated with the low or high dosages of fenugreek. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, lipid profile, inflammation cytokines, and adipokines were detected. Macrophage infiltration and adipose tissue morphology were observed. Western blot was conducted to investigate the expressions of inactive rhomboid 2 (iRhom2) and TACE as well as other signaling pathways in subcutaneous adipose tissue. KEY FINDINGS: We showed that fenugreek significantly suppressed body weight gain and fat accumulation in HFD-challenged obese mice. Meanwhile, fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in fenugreek-treated mice were remarkably decreased, which were properly explained by fenugreek-induced activation of the insulin receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties of fenugreek were shown by the decrease of systemic and local expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as reduced macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. Additionally, fenugreek markedly deactivated NF-κB and JNK pathways. Finally, we demonstrated that fenugreek strikingly repressed the transcriptions and expressions of iRhom2 and TACE. SIGNIFICANCE: Fenugreek shows an encouraging and promising property in ameliorating insulin resistance and suppressing inflammation in obesity, which might be realized by fenugreek-mediated inhibition of iRhom2/TACE axis-facilitated TNF-α release from adipocytes.",

It is associated with symptoms of itching, burning, dyspareunia, and postmenopausal bleeding. The present study evaluated the effects of fenugreek extract on atrophic vaginitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on 60 postmenopausal women in Ardabil, Iran, in 2018. The participants were selected using block randomization with the allocation ratio 1:1. Those in the intervention group received 0.5g (the applicator filled to the half-full mark) fenugreek vaginal cream 5% twice a week for 12 weeks. The control group received conjugated estrogens vaginal cream at the dose of 0.625 mg (the applicator filled to the half-full mark) containing 0.3 mg of conjugated estrogens. Atrophic vaginitis was evaluated before and after the treatment through clinical examination, clinical signs, and measurement of Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI). FINDINGS: After the 12-week intervention and modification of the baseline score, the mean (standard error) score for atrophic vaginitis signs was 3.100 (1.43-4.75). This difference was statistically significant in intragroup comparison and in favor of the control group in intergroup comparison (p=0.001). VMI was less than 49% in 86.7% and 46.7% of the participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively. This was a significant difference in favor of the control group (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that total fenugreek extract could be effective in treating signs of atrophic vaginitis, but it was not as effective as ultra-low-dose estrogen.",

As a result, 33 steroidal saponins and sapogenins were isolated, including six undescribed ones and 27 previously known molecules. Among them, compounds 10, 12, 17, 22 and 29 were five 25R and 25S isomer mixtures of spirostanol saponins or sapogenins.

METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial was conducted from November 2014 to June 2017. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years old with confirmed NAFLD were recruited from the Motahhari clinic, affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Participants either received 1 g hydroalcoholic extract of Fenugreek seeds or placebo daily for 3 months. The primary outcomes were changes in serum alanine transaminase and FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter score. Secondary outcome measures were changes in other laboratory data, liver stiffness measure, liver steatosis percent, and anthropometric variables. Participants were randomly assigned to the groups using blocked randomization method. Participants, investigators, and statistician were blinded to treatments allocation. RESULTS: After screening eighty patients, thirty patients met the inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups (1:1). After 3 months, two and four patients did not complete the trial in Fenugreek and placebo group, respectively. The changes in the anthropometrics, laboratories and FibroScan measurements were not statistically significant between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The evidence to prove the efficacy of the Fenugreek seeds' hydroalcoholic extract in NAFLD was not strong enough; hence, further experiments are still needed to assess the possible efficacy of Fenugreek on the treatment of NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes or night sweats) are closely related to the impaired quality of life in menopausal women. Fenugreek is the ripe seed of Trigonella foenum graecum Linn. In China, this plant is used to relieve menopausal symptoms in women. Although recent studies have shown that fenugreek may have a good effect on the menopausal symptoms, there is no meta-analysis to systematically evaluate its efficacy in improving menopausal vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria will be retrieved in 5 English online databases and 4 Chinese online databases. The primary outcomes are changes in frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms that measured by validated scales. The secondary outcomes will include quality of life, blood hormone parameters, blood biochemical parameters, and adverse events. Heterogeneity of data will be assessed by I and Cochrane Q statistics. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis will be performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Egger test and Begg test will be used to assess the publication bias. Finally, we will evaluate the quality of evidence by the GRADE approach. All the data statistics will be performed using the STATA 15.0 software. RESULTS: All the results of will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis will systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenugreek in the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms. OSF REGISTRATION NUMBER: 10.17605/OSF.IO/3BCY8.",

The study objective was to examine whether a fenugreek seed extract would improve healthy men's aging male symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), grip strength, and anxiety. METHODS: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was employed, using a parallel design, with assessments at baseline, Day 30, and Day 60. Healthy male volunteers (n = 57, mean age = 26.1 years) were randomized to: fenugreek 400 mg/d (n = 19), fenugreek 500 mg/d (n = 19), or placebo group (n = 19). RESULTS: The fenugreek groups reported significant improvements in aging male symptoms, anxiety levels, grip strength, and indicators of HRQoL compared to the placebo group, p's < 0.05. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Fenugreek supplementation is an effective nutritional intervention for improving aging male symptoms, anxiety levels, grip strength, and aspects of HRQoL in healthy recreationally active men. Future researchers are encouraged to examine the health and ergogenic effects of fenugreek supplementation in hypogonadal and older populations.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diosignin and 4-hydroxy-L-isulosine (4-OH-Ile) are the two active ingredients of Fenugreek (Trigonella foenumgraecum). Thus, in this study, we examined the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of fenugreek seeds (HEFS), diosgenin and 4-OH-Ile on the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) which are involved in lipid metabolism in SW480 cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, SW480 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium and treated with HEFS, diosignin, 4-OH-Ile or orlistat for 24 and 48 hours. Inhibitory concentration of 20% (IC20) was calculated using MTT method and cells were then pre-treated with the IC20 concentrations for 24 and 48 hours before RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Changes in the expression of ACC, FAS, PPARγ and LDLR genes were assayed by employing the real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. RESULTS: Our results showed a significant down-regulation in the expression of ACC (P<0.001 and P<0.001 after 24 and 48 hours, respectively) and FAS genes (P<0.001 and P<0.001 after 24 and 48 hours, respectively) in SW480 cells treated with HEFS, diosignin, 4-OH-Ile, or orlistat, but significant up-regulation in the expression of PPARγ (P<0.001 and P<0.001 after 24 and 48 hours, respectively) and LDLR (P=0.005 and P=0.001 after 24 and 48 hours, respectively). CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, HEFS, diosgenin and 4-OH-Ile up or down-regulate the expression of some predominant genes involved in lipid metabolism pathway, similar to that observed for orlistat. These types of regulatory effects are presumably proper for the treatment of obesity and overweight."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fenugreek and chromium are known to have anti-diabetic properties and this has been well demonstrated by multiple studies. Researches have been undertaken to study thebiofortification of chromium (Cr3+) in fenugreek. Some of the researchers have studied the biofortification from the soil irrigated with tannery waste water or from soil amended by tannery-sludge, with a view of enhancing the anti-diabetic effect of fenugreek plants. The present research work was also undertaken to increase the chromium content of fenugreek seeds, but through direct treatment of chromium picolinate solution to fenugreek seeds. METHODS: Fenugreek seeds were procured and divided in four groups having three batches of 10 g seeds- treatment1, treatment2, control1 and control2. Control1 group was kept raw and was given no treatment and control2 group was germinated using double distilled water. Treatment1 and treatment2, on the other hand, were given treatment of 0.02 g and 0.04 g chromium picolinate solution, on first day and 0.01 g and 0.02 g chromium picolinate solution on second day, respectively. The germinated samples were then completely dried, powdered, digested with di-acid mixture and assayed using Inductively Coupled Plasma optical emission spectrometry method for chromium content. The treatment1 sample was selected for further nutritional analysis along with control1 and control2 group to compare the nutritional composition of raw, germinated and chromium treated fenugreek seed flour. Fifteen sprouts from treatment1 group (treatment1A group) and fifteen sprouts from control2 group (control3 group) were sown in earthen pots for the analysis of chromium content in seeds of new plants. RESULTS: The fenugreek seeds treated with two different concentrations of chromium picolinate viz. treatment1 and treatment2 group attained 55 and 80 times higher chromium content as compared to control2 group, respectively. All the estimated minerals and bioactive compounds were significantly high (p ≤ 0.01) in germinated fenugreek seed flour and chromium treated fenugreek seed flour compared to raw fenugreek seed flour. Germinated fenugreek seed flour and chromium treated fenugreek seed flour were statistically comparable to each other in respect of all the parameters analysed. Hence, it was evident that enriching fenugreek seeds with chromium, did not affect the nutritional content of fenugreek seed by any mean. Also, there was no significant difference between the chromium content in seeds of control3 group and T1A group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of fenugreek seeds with chromium solution seems to be an efficient and safe method for increasing their chromium concentration as compared to application of chromium to the soil for biofortification with minimal to no chance of chromium accumulation and inheritance in next generation plants. However, there is a need of more research to see how reliable these observations would be when different chromium salts and/or varied chromium concentration are used."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to determine the effects of fenugreek seed (FS) on serum irisin levels, blood pressure, and liver and kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In an 8-week randomized controlled clinical trial, T2DM patients (n = 50) were assigned to the intervention (5 g FS powder, 3 times a day) or control group. Both groups received anti-diabetic drugs and nutritional consults. Serum samples were collected and blood pressure was measured at baseline and end of the trial. Data on dietary intake and physical activity was determined using the questionnaires. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, FS consumption resulted in a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p = 0.024), as well as a significant change in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.02) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p = 0.001). Within-group analysis showed a significant decrease in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.014), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = 0.001), and irisin (p = 0.001) in the FS group, and a significant increase in creatinine (Cr) (p = 0.001) and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p = 0.001) in the control group. FS consumption did not have any significant effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). CONCLUSION: FS intake has some beneficial effects on FPG, SBP, and some liver and kidney function tests in patients with T2DM. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of FS on irisin levels. Trial registration number http://www.irct.ir, code: IRCT20190618043924N1.",

Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), associated with Leguminosae family is used as a herbal medicine with potent antioxidant properties. The present study was aimed to scrutinise the preventative role of fenugreek seeds aqueous extract (FSEt) on BPA-induced testicular damage in mice. Study included four different groups of male Balb/c mice: contol (C), fenugreek (FSEt), bisphenol A (BPA) and fenugreek + bisphenol A (FSEt + BPA). After two months of treatment, assessment of sperm parameters, antioxidant defence system, histopathological studies, germ cell count and gene expression of intrinsic apoptotic pathway were carried out. Administration of FSEt improved the damage caused by BPA as indicated by improved sperm parameters. FSEt-administered mice showed improvement in the histoarchitecture compared with BPA-administered animals. In addition, fenugreek treatment showed reduced levels of malondialdehyde and elevated levels of antioxidant enzymes. Expression studies of apoptotic markers revealed a significant decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 and significant increase in caspase-9 and caspase-3. However, FSEt restored the deleterious effects caused by BPA. The current findings plausibly might have promising protective role against BPA-induced testicular damage.",
