      "abstract": "Biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a considerable challenge in treating infections. We aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of crocin, naringin, and naringenin on biofilm formation capacity and the expression of the lecA gene by this organism. One hundred unrepeated P. aeruginosa isolates were collected from hospitalized patients and were identified. The antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was determined using the disk agar diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of naringin, naringenin, and crocin was determined by a micro broth dilution test. Then, the biofilm production ability of the isolates was evaluated before and after treatment with the investigated flavonoids using the microtiter plate test. Finally, the lecA gene expression of the isolates was checked before and after treatment with investigated flavonoids using the Real-time PCR method. Among 89 biofilm-producer isolates, 48 (53.93%), 17 (19.1%), and 24 (26.96%) showed a strong, moderate, and weak biofilm formation ability. Biofilm-positive isolates were more resistant to all tested antibiotics. Also, among 41 multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates, 33 (80.48%) were strong biofilm producers (P-value=0.01). A strong correlation was observed between the lecA gene expression and the biofilm production ability of the isolates (P-value=0.000). The investigated flavonoids were significantly effective on biofilm production by P. aeruginosa. Among 10 strong-biofilm producers, all (100%) showed a moderate ability to form biofilm after treatment with crocin (P-value=0.02), and 6 (60%) isolates had lost their ability to produce biofilm after treatment with the simultaneous use of crocin with ciprofloxacin or tobramycin (P-value=0.000). Also, one isolate was grouped as biofilm-negative after treatment with naringin (P-value=0.012). The crocin, naringin, and naringenin and their concurrent use of antibiotics decreased 2-8-fold of the lecA gene expression in strong biofilm-producer isolates (P-value˂0.05). Crocin, naringin, and naringenin can be used separately or simultaneously with antibiotics to inhibit biofilm and reduce the expression of virulence factors effective in biofilm production in P. aeruginosa."

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide health issue. It causes illness and death in millions of people each year. A positive correlation has been observed between the intake of dietary fat and the development of CRC. The composition of gut microbiota exhibits a significant correlation with pathophysiologic processes in intestine. Clinical treatment remains inadequate due to the complex pathogenic mechanisms of CRC triggered by a high-fat diet (HFD). Naringenin, a flavonoid from grapefruit, has anti-cancer activity. Our findings suggest that naringenin enhances gut microbiota diversity by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacterial species while reducing opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. The fecal microbiota transplantation assay (FMT) demonstrated that the anti-HFD-CRC activity of naringenin depended on the gut microbiota. Furthermore, naringenin antagonized the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. These results suggest that naringenin may be a potential treatment for HFD-CRC.",

      "abstract": "Burns can cause long-term complications and require immediate and effective treatment in patients. The therapeutic potential of naringenin (NG) is hampered by its hydrophobic nature. To improve the bioavailability and efficacy of NG in experimental burn wounds in mice, NG-loaded nanomicelles (NGMs) were prepared using the thin-film hydration method. The characterization of the formulation in different concentrations (0.3 %, 0.6 %, and 1.25 %) was carried out using HPLC, DLS, and TEM techniques. A second-degree burn was inflicted on the back of the mice for evaluation of NGM efficacy. The NGM formulation was evaluated topically on the treated mice for wound recovery, improvement of histological and immunohistochemical parameters, and in vitro antibacterial activity. The effect of NGMs on wound healing was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome staining (MT), and expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and nuclear factor-κB (NFκ-B) using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The characterization tests revealed nanosized micelles with dimensions around 7 nm and a high entrapment efficiency percentage of NG which had sustained release behavior. Wound healing was significantly faster in mice treated with NGMs (0.3 %) compared to other concentrations, silver sulfadiazine (SSD), and an untreated group. IHC analysis of mice receiving NGMs (0.3 %) showed a significant reduction in NFκ-B, while TGF-β1 was increased. In addition, NGMs exhibited significant bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. These findings show that NGMs accelerate the wound-healing process and lead to regeneration of the epidermis without the need for additional medication."

      "abstract": "The P. aeruginosa, widely spread and highly detrimental nosocomial pathogen, exhibits extensive intrinsic and acquired antibiotics resistance. Naringenin, a flavonoid compound, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities, especially in inhibiting the growth of many pathogenic bacteria. Our study revealed that naringenin showed significant inhibition on the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa at non bactericidal concentrations. At the concentration of 200 μg·mL-1, naringenin inhibited the swarming and swimming motility of P. aeruginosa, reduced pyocyanin secretion, and flagella assembly. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiment was conducted, and the results showed that naringenin could reduce the expression of bacterial virulence factors related to P. aeruginosa. Naringenin inhibited bacterial adherence capability to cells in vitro. The larvae of Galleria mellonella showed a higher survival rate in treatment with naringenin in vivo. These findings suggested a promising role of naringenin in suppressing the virulence of P. aeruginosa, which encompasses the growth inhibition of various pathogenic bacteria. This indicates substantial potential for future therapeutic interventions targeting bacterial virulence."

While tamoxifen, a commonly used drug therapy in breast cancer patients, is effective, many patients acquire tamoxifen resistance. Therefore, it is essential to identify alternative or combination therapeutics for the treatment of breast cancer. Naringenin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has been reported to elicit antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cells. The current study aimed to identify the mechanism by which naringenin induces apoptosis in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. The present study demonstrated that naringenin induced an increase in ROS, resulting in oxidative stress, impaired mitochondrial function, and apoptosis in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Our study reports that naringenin specifically increases mitochondrial superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide production while also causing mitochondrial dysfunction. These studies provide novel evidence for the mechanism by which naringenin induces apoptosis in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells and supports the use of naringenin as a therapeutic on breast cancer cells and drug-resistant cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections, with efflux mechanisms highlighted as reducing the efficacy of antibiotics. In this study, we investigated the potential of naringenin, a natural flavonoid, as an antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor in S. aureus strains 1199 and 1199B. The studies used minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays, ethidium bromide (EtBr) fluorescence emission enhancement assays, cell membrane permeability assays, and in silico molecular docking and ADME prediction assays. Naringenin showed no relevant antibacterial activity (MIC ≥1024 μg/mL). However, it potentiated the effect of norfloxacin and EtBr, reducing their MICs and increasing the fluorescence emission of EtBr, suggesting a possible inhibition of the NorA efflux pump. Bacterial membrane permeability was not significantly affected. Molecular docking assays indicated that naringenin interacts with the chlorpromazine binding site and has more favorable affinity energy than the chlorpromazine-NorA complex. ADME prediction showed favorable physicochemical properties, good oral absorption, metabolic stability and central nervous system safety. Therefore, naringenin demonstrates the potential to reverse the efficacy of norfloxacin in S. aureus by associating with efflux inhibition through effective interactions with the NorA protein, suggesting its therapeutic potential against bacterial resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by rapid cell proliferation, invasive behavior, and chemoresistance. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is implicated in chemoresistance and immune evasion, making it a promising therapeutic target. Natural compounds such as flavonoids have gained attention for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Among them, naringenin, a citrus-derived flavonoid, exerts antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the antiglioma effects of the flavonoid naringenin on the viability, growth, and migration of glioma cells and its potential role as an AhR modulator. METHODS: Human (U87) and rat (C6) glioma cell lines were exposed to naringenin (10-300 µM) alone or in combination with the AhR agonist indole-3-carbinol (50 µM) for 24 to 48 h. Cell viability, scratch wound, and cell migration assays were performed. The expression of inflammatory markers was also analyzed by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Naringenin exerted dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell viability and migration. The treatment decreased the gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and chemokine (CCL2), alongside increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) expression, an effect reversed by the AhR agonist. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight naringenin's potential as an antiglioma agent and its role in AhR signaling."

AIM: This study evaluates the neuroprotective effects of naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, against diazinon-induced cerebellar damage in male albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups: control, naringenin, diazinon, and diazinon with naringenin. RESULTS: Histological examination revealed altered structures of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of the diazinon group. Naringenin co-treatment significantly improved cerebellar histology and modulated oxidative stress markers by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels. Additionally, naringenin exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) levels, while increasing interleukin-10 (IL-10). It also reduced apoptotic markers, including p53, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3, while increasing the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2. Furthermore, naringenin modulated AChE activity, leading to decreased acetylcholine levels and reduced neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that naringenin's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties contribute to its neuroprotective role against diazinon-induced cerebellar damage."

Here, we investigated the effects of naringenin (NAR) on early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) experimentally induced in a rat MASH model and whether the NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptosis pathway was involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals were fed a hepatopathogenic diet for 16 weeks and carbon tetrachloride (400 mg/kg, i.p.) and diethylnitrosamine (40 mg/kg, i.p.) were injected once a week. NAR was administered at 100 mg/kg p.o. The effects of NAR on the MASHHCC protocol were evaluated using biochemical, histological, in silico, and molecular biological approaches. RESULTS: NAR significantly mitigated liver damage, as evidenced by the reduction in liver damage markers. It also reduced steatosis and inflammation, as determined by decreased lipid accumulation and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1C, interleukins 1-beta and 18, and nuclear factor kappa B levels, and also increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma levels. NAR inhibits the formation of NLRP3, including the recruitment of caspase-1 and gasdermin D proteins, and reduces the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and hepatic collagen 1, thereby diminishing extracellular matrix synthesis. Furthermore, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, glutathione S-transferase pi 1, and the proliferation marker KI67 were considerably reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that NAR has the potential to inhibit early HCC induced in the context of MASH, thereby suggesting that NAR could be used for MASH treatment in humans."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease with an increasing prevalence worldwide. Naringenin (NAR) has been proven effective in preventing UC, but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, network pharmacology and bioinformatics methods are used to screen the genes associated with NAR and UC. A mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC is established. After treatment with NAR, the disease activity index (DAI) is scored, and colonic histopathology is observed via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The expressions of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway and inflammation-related factors in the colons of UC mice are examined via western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results of the animal experiments reveal that the model group of UC mice present the most severe weight loss and the highest DAI scores. After the administration of NAR, weight loss is alleviated, and DAI scores are reduced ( P < 0.05). NAR improves pathological manifestations in the mouse colon, such as reducing inflammatory cell infiltration and restoring goblet cell loss ( P < 0.05). NAR significantly increases the protein expression levels of Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1) in the colon ( P < 0.05) but decreases the protein expression levels of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) ( P < 0.05), thus alleviating the inflammatory response in UC model mice."

However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its hydrophobic and crystalline nature. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential and molecular mechanisms of NAR efficiently loaded into cationic nanoparticles (NP-NAR) for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in a mouse model. The results demonstrated that NP-NAR effectively ameliorated lipid metabolism dysbiosis, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and inflammation in MASLD mice. Transcriptomic analysis and molecular data revealed that NP-NAR promoted fatty acid oxidation via activation of the PPAR signaling pathway, reduced hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis by inhibiting the expressions of key genes including CD36, ACC, and FASN. Moreover, NP-NAR modulated cholesterol metabolism by inhibiting the classical bile acid synthesis pathway. 16 S rDNA gene sequencing revealed a disbalanced gut microbiota in MASLD mice, whereas NP-NAR treatment statistically reversed the abundance changes of several intestinal bacteria at the phylum and genus levels, which partly contributed to the balance in intestinal metabolite production, including short-chain fatty acids. In conclusion, these findings suggest that NP-NAR may be a promising candidate for the treatment of obesity-associated MASLD, offering new insight into the mechanisms underlying NAR's efficacy against MASLD.",

Several techniques were used to characterize the synthesized GNANPs, including UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and photoluminescence (PL). They were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties, cytotoxicity, ROS accumulation, apoptotic activity, and oxidative stress markers against AGS cells. The characterization analyses indicated the existence of Glutaraldehyde-crosslinked Naringenin-loaded Albumin Nanoparticles with an oval-shaped morphology and an average particle size of 127.80 nm. The existence of several elements and functional groups in the GNANPs was also detected using EDX and FT-IR analyses, respectively. The synthesized GNANPs have shown exceptional antibacterial activities by effectively inhibiting the growth of several infections. The treatment of GNANPs efficiently inhibited the growth of AGS cells. Fluorescence staining studies showed increased apoptosis and oxidative stress markers in AGS cells treated with synthesized Glutaraldehyde-crosslinked Naringenin-loaded Albumin Nanoparticles, indicating their potential as a viable cancer treatment option.",

Similarly, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely used in the biomedical industry for therapy and diagnostics for a long time. This study investigates the potential of naringenin functionalized silver nanoparticles (AgN NPs) as a potential wound healing agent. The synthesis of AgN NPs was carried out using the one-pot synthesis method in the alkaline pH. Naringenin is used as the capping and the reducing agent. The naringenin-capped AgNPs were synthesized in six different concentrations. The structural, morphological, and spectroscopic characterization for each sample was conducted. The size of the nanoparticles was studied using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiment and further confirmed using TEM. The crystalline structure was investigated using X-ray diffraction, and AgN NPs exhibited a fcc crystal structure. The FTIR confirmed the capping of naringenin on AgNPs. All samples were tested for antibacterial activity, and the results demonstrated zones of inhibition against both Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, AgN NPs exhibited dose-dependent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties. The wound healing potential of AgN NPs was evaluated using a scratch wound assay in L929 cell lines. After 24 h, the scratch area was significantly reduced in the AgN NPs-treated sample, indicating enhanced cell migration compared to naringenin. Hence, these findings suggest that AgN NPs may serve as a more promising wound-healing agent than naringenin."

Due to structural similarity to 17-β-estradiol (E2), phytoestrogens can bind to estrogen receptors (ERs) to exert context-dependent estrogenic and/or anti-estrogenic effects. As such, there are potential health benefits and risks associated with phytoestrogen exposure. To investigate the effects of Nar in breast cancer, based on its activity as a phytoestrogen, we treated MCF-7 ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells with Nar (10 µM) and examined transcriptomic changes in MCF-7 cells induced by Nar treatment. Pathway analysis included in our dataset shows upregulation of genes associated with estrogen signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells treated with naringenin."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The main purpose of the study was the formulation development of nanogels (NHs) composed of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and low molecular weight chitosan (lCH), loaded with a naringenin-β-cyclodextrin complex (NAR/β-CD), as a potential treatment for early-stage diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Different formulations of NHs were prepared by varying polymer concentration, lCH ratio, and pH and, then, characterized for particle size, zeta potential, particle concentration (particles/mL) and morphology. Cytotoxicity and internalization were assessed in vitro using Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). The NAR/β-CD complex was prepared and evaluated for morphology, complexation efficiency, and solubility. Finally, the most promising NH prototype was loaded with NAR/β-CD (NH@NAR/β-CD) and further characterized for encapsulation efficiency, loading capacity, opacity and cytotoxicity on HUVEC; in vitro release test and DPPH assay were performed to investigate NH capability to sustain NAR release and NH@NAR/β-CD antioxidant properties, respectively. RESULTS: NH properties were influenced by polymer concentration, lCH ratio, and pH. N3 (0.5 mg/mL; lCH=1.5:1; pH = 5) and N9 (0.5 mg/mL; lCH=1:1; pH = 5) showed optimal characteristics, including small size (<350 nm) and positive zeta potential, facilitating cellular uptake. The NAR/β-CD complex showed 71% complexation efficiency and enhanced NAR solubility. Since characterized by superior properties and better in vitro biocompatibility, N3 was loaded with NAR/β-CD. N3@NAR/β-CD capability to sustain in vitro NAR release, radical scavenging activity and in vitro biocompatibility were finally demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The physico-chemical properties of N3@NAR/β-CD were responsible for their cell uptake, suggesting their potential to target retinal endothelial cells. The high NAR/β-CD complexation efficiency and the sustained NAR release over 72 hours could guarantee the maintenance of an effective drug concentration at the damage site while reducing the injection number. Further studies about the safety and the effectiveness of the intravitreal injection of NHs@NAR/β-CD will be performed on a diabetic animal model.",

Antifungal therapy represents a challenging problem because, in addition to presenting many side effects, fungal resistance has been increasing in recent years. As a result, the search for new therapeutic agents has advanced with the use of new technologies such as nanoparticles (NPs).Aim. Synthesize, characterize and evaluate the antifungal potential of naringenin (NAR)-stabilized silver NPs.Methodology. The biosynthesis of NPs was stabilized using the NAR molecule and an aqueous solution of silver nitrate. The characterization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was performed using different methods, which include UV-visible spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential measurements and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Antifungal activity was evaluated against clinical isolates of Candida albicans by determining the MIC and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC).Results. The AgNP NAR showed a colloidal appearance with an average size of 14.71 nm and zeta potential measured at -33.3 mV, indicating a highly stable suspension. XRD analysis confirmed the crystal structure. FTIR spectra showed the presence of several functional groups of plant compounds, which play an important role in the coating and bioreduction processes. The antifungal activity against C. albicans showed an MIC of 3.55 µg ml-1 and an MFC of 7.1 µg ml-1. According to the growth kinetic assay in 12 h, there was a reduction of ~50% (<3 log10). Furthermore, AgNP NAR did not show mutagenic potential.Conclusion. The AgNP NAR obtained presented ideal characteristics for biomedical applications, good stability and promising antimicrobial activity.",

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is a common malignant tumor found in adolescents, characterized by a high metastatic potential and poor prognosis, but it is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Ferroptosis is a novel form of regulated cell death induced by excessive iron accumulation, leading to lipid peroxidation that results in cellular dysfunction and death. Naringenin is a flavonoid known for its anti-cancer properties, yet its role in osteosarcoma has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we found that naringenin significantly reduced the viability of osteosarcoma cells while increasing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), iron overload, and the excessive expression of malondialdehyde (MDA). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (MGST2) is highly expressed in osteosarcoma cells. Silencing MGST2 decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of these cells and enhanced their sensitivity to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) binds to the MGST2 promoter, promoting its transcription. Naringenin inhibits STAT3, blocking the expression of MGST2, while the STAT3 agonist Colivelin reverses this effect. In vivo experiments further confirmed that naringenin inhibited tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft models and exhibited good biosafety. In summary, our study demonstrates that naringenin induces ferroptosis in osteosarcoma cells through the STAT3-MGST2 signaling pathway, providing a promising strategy for osteosarcoma treatment."

      "abstract": "Naringenin has the potential to regulate ferroptosis and mitigate renal damage in diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, it remains unclear whether the naringenin's effects in DN are linked to its ability to regulate ferroptosis. This study investigated the potential anti-ferroptosis properties of naringenin in high glucose (HG)-induced renal tubular epithelial cell models. HK-2 cells were cultured in HG medium to establish the DN cell model. HK-2 cells were treated with different doses of naringenin to explore the effect of naringenin. The CCK-8 results show that 50 μM ~ 200 μM of naringenin do not affect the viability of HK-2 cells and the viability of HG-induced HK-2 cells increase in a dose-dependent manner with naringenin treatment. Additionally, naringenin increased the levels of IL-10 while decreasing the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and ROS in HG-induced HK-2 cells. Naringenin also reduced the levels of Fe2+, oxidized lipid ROS, MDA, 4-HNE, ACSL4, and TFR1 in HG-induced HK-2 cells, while increasing the levels of non-oxidized lipid ROS, SOD, GSH-Px, SLC7A11, and GPX4. Meanwhile, naringenin restored the levels of MMP, ATP and MPTP opening, reduced OCR in HG-induced HK-2 cells. Furthermore, naringenin reversed the decreased expression of SIRT1, p-FOXO3a, Nrf2 and Nuclear Nrf2 caused by HG. SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 and Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 attenuated the effects of naringenin on ferroptosis in HG-induced HK-2 cells, with EX527 demonstrating a stronger reversal effect on ferroptosis than ML385. These results suggest that naringenin inhibits ferroptosis in HG-induced HK-2 cells mainly through SIRT1/FOXO3a signaling pathway. This finding further enhanced our understanding of the mechanism behind naringenin's protective effect on DN.",

Thirty male rats were classified into 5 groups as follows: 1- Normal control (NC), 2- Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) group, 3- NP group, 4- NP + RES and 5- NP + NG. Results revealed that NP treatment significantly decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase, Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase and Glutathione content in blood, liver and kidney compared to NC and DMSO groups. Conversely, activity of Glutathione-s-transferase was significantly elevated in blood and decreased in liver and kidney. Moreover, significant escalation was observed in the levels of Malondialdehyde. Also, NP treatment led to a significant decrease in serum total testosterone and testis weight, accompanied with concurrent elevation in estradiol level compared to NC and DMSO groups. All the recorded effects induced by NP treatment were effectively countered by co-treatment with RES or NG. In addition, molecular docking studies were carried out to reveal the interactions between NP, RES, NG and estrogen receptor beta which provide a possible mechanism for their potential estrogenic activity. Overall, our study gives a deeper understanding of the toxic effect of NP on antioxidant capacity and endocrine functions as well as the potential therapeutic utility of RES and NG in alleviating these adverse effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Naringenin, a flavonoid compound found in citrus fruits, possesses valuable anticancer properties. However, its potential application in cancer treatment is limited by poor bioavailability and pharmacokinetics at tumor sites. To address this, Naringenin nanoparticles (NARNPs) were prepared using the emulsion diffusion technique and their anticancer effects were investigated in HepG2 cells. METHODS: The particle size of NARNPs was determined by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analysis. NARNP is characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Study the cytotoxic effects of various doses of naringenin, NARNPs and DOX on HepG2 and WI38 cell lines after 24 h and 48 h using the MTT assay. Flow cytometric analysis was used to study the apoptotic cells. The study also examined the expression of apoptotic proteins (p53) and autophagy-related genes ATG5, LC3 after treatment with naringenin, NARNPs, doxorubicin, and their combinations in HepG2 cells. RESULTS: The particle size of NARNPs was determined by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analysis, showing mean diameters of 54.96 ± 18.6 nm and 31.79 ± 6.8 nm, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed successful conjugation between naringenin and NARNPs. NARNPs were in an amorphous state that was determined by X-ray diffraction. The IC50 values were determined as 22.32 µg/ml for naringenin, 1.6 µg/ml for NARNPs and 0.46 µg/ml for doxorubicin. Flow cytometric analysis showed that NARNPs induced late apoptosis in 56.1% of HepG2 cells and had no cytotoxic effect on WI38 cells with 97% viable cells after 48 h of incubation. NARNPs induced cell cycle arrest in the Go/G1 and G2/M phases in HepG2 cells. The results showed increased expression of ATG5, LC3, and p53 in HepG2 cells treated with IC50 concentrations after 48 h of incubation. NARNPs enhanced the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells but decreased the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin in WI38 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that NARNPs effectively inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Importantly, NARNPs showed no cytotoxic effects on normal cells, indicating their potential as a promising therapy for hepatocarcinogenesis. Combining NARNPs with chemotherapy drugs could present a novel approach for treating human cancers.",

      "abstract": "Nephrotoxicity remains a significant concern associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib (DASA). Previous studies have shown that DASA can induce renal tubular cell death, contributing to its nephrotoxic effects. In contrast, naringenin (NGN) is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to explore the nephroprotective potential of NGN against acute kidney injury induced by DASA in a mouse model. Mice were pre-treated with different doses of NGN (50, 100 mg/kg) for one week, followed by a single dose of DASA (25 mg/kg) on the 8th day. Results demonstrated that DASA significantly increased serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase, which were effectively attenuated by NGN pretreatment. Furthermore, kidney tissues exposed to DASA exhibited elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, which were significantly reduced by NGN. NGN also restored depleted levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT)) in kidney tissues following DASA treatment. Additionally, NGN mitigated the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, NF-κB, and IL-6) induced by DASA, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. Notably, DASA treatment upregulated the gene expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BAX while downregulating the expression of BCL-2 and Caspase-3 in kidney tissues. These findings suggest that NGN exerts nephroprotective effects against DASA-induced nephrotoxicity through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved.",

      "abstract": "The present study examines whether the systemic application of naringenin (NRG) reduces inflammation-induced hyperexcitability in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (SpVc) related to hyperalgesia, and compares its impact with that of diclofenac (DIC). To provoke inflammation, the whisker pads of rats were injected with complete Freund's adjuvant, and subsequently, mechanical stimuli were administered to the orofacial region to determine the escape threshold. Compared to naïve rats, the inflamed rats showed a significantly lower mechanical threshold, and this reduced threshold returned to normal levels two days post-administration of NRG, DIC, and half-dose DIC plus half-dose NRG (1/2 DIC + 1/2 NRG). Using extracellular single-unit recordings, the activity of SpVc wide-dynamic range neurons was measured in response to mechanical stimulation of the orofacial area under anesthesia. The average firing rate of SpVc neurons when exposed to both non-painful and painful mechanical stimuli was significantly reduced in inflamed rats following NRG, DIC, and 1/2 DIC + 1/2 NRG administration. The heightened average spontaneous activity of SpVc neurons in rats with inflammation was significantly reduced following NRG, DIC, and 1/2 DIC + 1/2 NRG administration. The increased average receptive field size observed in inflamed rats reverted to normal levels after either NRG, DIC, or 1/2 DIC + 1/2 NRG treatment. These findings indicate that NRG administration can reduce inflammatory hyperalgesia linked to the heightened excitability of SpVc wide-dynamic range neurons.",

      "abstract": "Naringenin (4,5,7-trihydroxyflavone, NAR) is an effective active ingredient in Rhizoma Drynariae, which has many biological functions, encompassing anti-inflammatory and -oxidant functions. Prior research has shown that NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes possessed a significant contribution to osteoporosis. However, the NAR impact on bone loss caused by microgravity remains unclear. Classical microgravity simulation methods were used to induce simulated microgravity (SMG) in mice and cells. Microcomputed tomography, immunohistochemical examination, and hematoxylin and eosin staining were implemented to ascertain alterations in bone microstructure and morphology in mice subsequent to NAR gavage. Cellular investigations were implemented encompassing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence labeling to investigate the molecular mechanism behind NAR resistance to microgravity-induced bone loss. Our research has shown that NAR can significantly enhance the SMG-stimulated alterations in bone microstructure and morphology in mice, mainly by increasing the trabecular thickness, bone volume fraction, and trabecular number while increasing the bone trabecula number. Cell experiments also showed that SMG caused the activation of inflammatory corpuscles of NLRP3 and induced pyroptosis simultaneously, which can be confirmed by the upregulation of protein and mRNA expression levels such as those of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, gasdermin D, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein. The occurrence of pyroptosis further led to the disorder of osteogenic differentiation, which showed that the osteopontin, Runt-related transcription factor 2, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and alkaline phosphatase expression levels were decreased. The intervention of NAR can activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) pathway, reverse this phenomenon via controlling the reactive oxygen species generation in cells and correcting mitochondrial malfunction, weaken the pyroptosis of osteoblasts (OBs), and promote osteogenic differentiation. In summary, NAR could hinder the pyroptosis of OBs caused by SMG and promote osteogenic differentiation via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. This provides a unique view for inhibiting bone loss under weightlessness and confirms the NAR capacity in treating microgravity-stimulated bone loss, giving new ideas and methods for future space medicine development.",

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical problem with no effective treatment. Excessive folic acid (FA) induced kidney tubular injury is characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, and is a common model of AKI. The excellent pharmacological activity of naringenin (NAR) makes it a potential agent for treating AKI, but its poor solubility limits its application. This study prepared NAR loaded nanoparticles (FU/PVP-NAR) using fucoidan (FU) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as carriers, with a particle size of 23.96 ± 2.77 nm. In vitro studies showed that FU/PVP-NAR inhibited excessive FA induced proliferation inhibition, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of HK-2 cells. Further confirmed that FU/PVP-NAR inhibited FA induced DNA damage and Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation. In vivo studies showed that excessive FA induced AKI features in mice, such as elevated serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, accompanied by pathological damage to kidney tissues. The above AKI characteristics induced by FA were alleviated by FU/PVP-NAR. FU/PVP-NAR also inhibited the decrease in antioxidant enzyme levels in kidney tissues induced by FA. Furthermore, in vivo mechanism studies indicated that FU/PVP-NAR inhibited the release of inflammatory factors by inhibiting DNA damage-cGAS-STING pathway. In summary, this study provided the possibility for FU/PVP-NAR as a potential candidate drug for treating FA induced AKI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that naringenin possesses lipid-lowering effects; however, the underlying mechanisms, particularly its specific molecular targets, remain uncertain. METHODS: Using bioinformatics, three traditional Chinese medicine databases and one human disease database were integrated to establish two naringenin-target-hyperlipidemia modules: naringenin-oxidative stress (OS) and naringenin-lipid metabolism (LM). Data on 1,850 proteins from 1,871 genetic instruments were sourced from seven previous studies. Using Mendelian randomization based on data from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit genome-wide association study (case, n = 5,153; control, n = 344,069), we identified potential drug targets that were subsequently validated in the UK Biobank (396,565 individuals) and FinnGen (412,181 individuals) cohorts. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to verify the binding ability of naringenin and causal protein. RESULTS: In plasma, every standard deviation increase in apolipoprotein B (APOB) was associated with an increased risk of hyperlipidemia (odds ratio [OR] = 9.37, 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.12-17.12; P = 3.58e-13; posterior probability of hypothesis 4 [PPH4] = 0.997), and the same was observed for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (OR = 1.81, 95% CI, 1.51-2.16; P = 6.87e-11; PPH4 = 1) and neurocan (OR = 2.34, 95% CI, 1.82-3.01; P = 4.09e-11; PPH4 = 0.932). The intersection of two modules and Mendelian randomization result identified APOB as a key regulatory target of naringenin in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The binding energy between naringenin and APOB was determined to be -7.7 kcal/mol. Additionally, protein-protein interactions and protein-disease networks were analyzed to uncover potential connections between proteins and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSION: This Mendelian randomization-based combined analysis offers a robust framework for elucidating the pharmacological effects of naringenin and identifying candidate proteins for further investigation in the context of hyperlipidemia treatment."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To calculate the 50%inhibitory concentration (IC50) of hypericin for 24 and 48 hours, XTT assay performed. Cytotoxic effect of naringenin investigated by XTT and trypan blue exclusion assay further confirmed the inhibitory impact of these agents on Y79 cells viability. Flow cytometry Annexin V/PI determined the cell death. The mRNAs expression level of Bax and Bcl-2 investigated by real-time PCR in different groups including the control, cells treated with naringenin, hypericin, or concurrent with both compounds. RESULTS: The 24 and 48 hours IC50 of hypericin, calculated to be 2.5 and 1.25 (μg/ml), respectively. 50 (μg/ml) naringenin induced about 20% and 30% apoptosis in Y79 cells after 24 and 48 hours. Trypan blue staining and flow cytometry confirmed this data. Moreover, flowcytometry results, revealed that the kind cell death occurred in these cells post treatment was mostly apoptosis. Simultaneous treatment with both agents didn't show synergistic effect. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased in cells treated with hypericin but in cells treated with narigenin didn't show significant increase in the Bax mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Hypericin had more cytotoxic effect in Y79 cells compared with naringenin. Furthermore, hypericin and naringenin didn't have apoptotic synergistic effect in these cells. According to the real-time PCR results, hypericin induces apoptosis in Y79 cells by disrupt the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2."

MI arises from the blockage of a coronary artery, which disrupts blood flow and results in tissue death. Among therapeutic approaches, bioactives from medicinal plants emerge as promising for the development of new medicines. Objectives: This study explored the effects of naringenin (NAR 100 mg/kg), a flavonoid found in citrus fruits, in normotensive (NTR) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats, both subjected to isoproterenol (ISO 85 mg/kg)-induced MI. Results: Post-treatment assessments indicated that NAR reduced blood pressure and minimized clot formation, particularly notable in the SHR group, which helps mitigate damage related to hypertension and ISO exposure. Additionally, NAR effectively restored KCl-induced contractility in the aortas of both NTR and SHR groups. NAR treatment reduced reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) values and recovered the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) in NTR groups. Moreover, myocardial damage assessed through histological analyses was reduced in groups treated with NAR. Conclusions: The results highlight significant pathophysiological differences between the groups, suggesting that NAR has protective potential against ISO-induced cardiac damage, warranting further investigation into its protective effects and mechanisms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a significant clinical emergency, and investigating novel therapeutic approaches and understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for improving patient outcomes. Naringenin (Nar), a flavanone present in tomatoes and citrus fruits, is frequently consumed in the human diet and recognized for having immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Despite Nar being able to alleviate intestinal IRI, the exact molecular mechanisms remain elusive. PURPOSE: To investigate Nar's protective properties on intestinal IRI and elucidate the mechanisms, a comprehensive approach that combines network pharmacology analysis with experimental verification in vitro and in vivo was adopted. METHODS: The oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in IEC-6 cells and a murine model of intestinal IRI were used. Nar's effects on intestinal IRI were assessed through histological analysis using H&E staining and tight junction (TJ) protein expression. Ferroptosis-related parameters, including iron levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and mitochondrial morphology, were analyzed. Network pharmacology was utilized to predict the pathways through which Nar exerts its anti-ferroptosis effects. Further mechanistic insights were obtained through si-RNA transfection, YAP inhibitor (verteporfin, VP) treatment, ferroptosis inhibitor (Ferrostatin-1) and ferroptosis inducer (Erastin) application, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Western blotting. RESULTS: Our results revealed that pretreatment with Nar significantly mitigated intestinal tissue damage and improved gut barrier function, as evidenced by increased TJ proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin). Nar reduced iron, MDA, and ROS, while it increased GSH and SOD levels. Additionally, Nar alleviated mitochondrial damage in mice. Nar treatment increased GPX4 and SLC7A11, while decreasing ACSL4 levels both in vivo and in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that Nar may target the Hippo signaling pathway. Notably, YAP, a key transcriptional co-activator within the Hippo pathway, was downregulated in intestinal IRI mice and OGD/R-induced IEC-6 cells. Nar pretreatment activated YAP, thereby augmenting anti-ferroptosis effects. The inhibition of YAP activation by VP or YAP knockdown increased p-STAT3 expression, thereby diminishing Nar's efficacy. Co-IP and immunofluorescence studies confirmed the interaction between YAP and STAT3. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Nar can inhibit ferroptosis in intestinal IRI via activating YAP, which in turn suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation, thereby unveiling a novel mechanism and supporting Nar's potential to be a promising therapeutic agent for intestinal IRI.",

Combining existing antibiotics with promising nonantibiotic agents is one strategy that has been shown to be effective at overcoming the widespread emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial activities and mechanism of naringenin (NG) combined with amikacin (AMK) against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli). We first measured the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) of NG combined with antibiotics via the checkerboard method. The results indicated that the combination of NG and AMK had a synergistic effect on E. coli ATCC 25922 and E. coli C7F3. In addition, this synergistic effect was verified by time-kill assays. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe cell morphology. The results showed that the cell wall of E. coli was destroyed. Furthermore, we assessed the leakage of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), K+, and protein. The extracellular AKP activity increased after the combinational group of 1/2MIC NG and 1/2MIC AMK, suggesting an impairment in cell wall permeability. An increase in the leakage of intracellular K+ and protein indicated an increase in cell inner membrane permeability. These results revealed that NG and AMK inhibited E. coli by damaging cell walls and membranes. In addition, PI uptake rapidly increased after treatment with NG and AMK. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed that NG caused cell wall and cell membrane damage in E. coli. In summary, our results provide a new strategy for responding to the development of E. coli drug resistance."

      "abstract": "Monkeypox virus (MPV) infection has developed into a re-emerging disease, and despite the potential of tecovirimat and cidofovir drugs, there is currently no conclusive treatment. The treatment's effectiveness and cost challenges motivate us to use In Silico approaches to seek natural compounds as candidate antiviral inhibitors. Using Maestro 11.5 in Schrodinger suite 2018, available natural molecules with validated chemical structures collected from Eximed Laboratory were subjected to molecular docking and ADMET analysis against the highly conserved A42R Profilin-like Protein of Monkeypox Virus Zaire-96-I-16 (PDB: 4QWO) with resolution of 1.52 Å solved 3D structure. Compared to the FDA-approved Tecovirimat, molecular docking revealed that Salsoline derivatives, Genistein, Semisynthetic derivative of kojic acid, and Naringenin had strengthened affinity (-8.9 to -10 kcal/mol) to 4QWO, and the molecular dynamic's simulation confirmed their high binding stability. In support of these results, the hydrogen bond analysis indicated that the Salsoline derivative had the most robust interaction with the binding pockets of 4QWO among the four molecules. Moreover, the comparative free energy analyses using MM-PBSA revealed an average binding free energy of the complexes of Salsoline derivative, Genistein, Semisynthetic derivative of kojic acid, Naringenin, of -106.418, -46.808, -50.770, and -63.319 kJ/mol, respectively which are lower than -33.855 kJ/mol of the Tecovirimat complex. Interestingly, these results and the ADMET predictions suggest that the four compounds are promising inhibitors of 4QWO, which agrees with previous results showing their antiviral activities against other viruses."

      "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment with Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved patient outcomes, yet challenges such as drug resistance and persistence of leukemic stem cells persist. This study explores the potential of naringenin, a natural flavonoid, to enhance the efficacy of Bcr-Abl TKIs in CML therapy. We showed that naringenin reduces viability of a panel of CML cell lines regardless of varying cellular origin and genetic mutations, and acts synergistically with dasatinib and ponatinib. Importantly, naringenin is effective in targeting blast crisis CML CD34+ cells by decreasing their colony formation, self-renewal and viability. Compared to CML, naringenin is significantly less effective against normal bone marrow (NBM) counterparts. In addition, naringenin significantly enhances the inhibitory effects of dasatinib in CML but not NBM CD34+ cells. Mechanism studies showed that naringenin's inhibitory effects were associated with the induction of oxidative stress and lipid damage, as evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Notably, naringenin upregulated genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis while downregulating antioxidant defense genes. Pretreatment with α-tocopherol, which inhibits lipid-mediated ROS production, completely abolished the ROS increase and restored cell viability, indicating that lysosomal lipid peroxidation plays a crucial role in naringenin's mechanism of action. In a CML xenograft mouse model, the combination of naringenin and dasatinib resulted in remarkably more tumor growth suppression compared to single drug alone. Importantly, this combination was well-tolerated, with no adverse effects on body weight observed. These findings suggest that naringenin, by inducing oxidative lipid damage, enhances the anti-leukemic effects of Bcr-Abl TKIs, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for CML.",

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate new therapies using less toxic leishmanicidal compounds, such as flavonoids like naringenin, and their combination with conventional drugs, such as miltefosine. Antileishmanial dose/response activity, isobologram, calculation of dose reduction index (DRI), and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) tests were performed on in vitro assays using reference promastigote forms of L. amazonensis (IFLA/BR/67/PH8) to assess the combinatorial effect between naringenin and miltefosine. The in vitro results of isobologram, DRI, and FICI calculations showed that the combination of the compounds had an additive effect and was able to reduce the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of miltefosine in the promastigote forms of the parasite compared to the treatment of the drug alone. This study demonstrated in vitro the viability of a combination action of the flavonoid with the treatment with miltefosine, opening space for further investigations on the association of natural compounds with the drugs used for the treatment of L. amazonensis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Naringenin has shown great promise in the realm of cancer therapeutics, demonstrating excellent cytotoxic action toward cancer cells and the enhanced effects of radiation therapy in vitro. However, the medicinal value of naringenin is severely limited clinically by poor bioavailability. Thus, multiple drug-delivery strategies for overcoming this limitation have been developed, of which liposomes are considered the most suitable due to their amphiphilic, modifiable, and biocompatible characteristics. In this study, we investigated the role of naringenin and liposomal-delivered naringenin as adjuncts to radiotherapy in the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell line in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liposomal-naringenin was synthesized by thin-film hydration and extrusion and was characterized by spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential. The effects of free-from naringenin and liposomal-naringenin were evaluated toward MDA-MB-231 cell viability when combined with varying doses of radiation. Additionally, cell growth patterns, morphology, and colony formation were evaluated. RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated IC50 values of 387.5 and 546.6 µg/ml for naringenin and liposomal-naringenin, respectively. Naringenin and liposomal-naringenin significantly lowered cell viability, proliferation, and colony formation dose-dependently, as compared to radiation in isolation. CONCLUSION: The findings presented herein concur with previous accounts of the radiosensitizing potential of naringenin and further highlight the considerable biomedical application of liposomal-naringenin within the realm of radiotherapy.",

METHODS: BCP model was manipulated by the injection of LL2 cells into femur of mice. The levels of TNF-α and uPA in bone tissue and serum were studied by ELISA. The expressions of PAR2, PKC-γ, PKA and TRPV1 were determined by qPCR and western blot. Levels of p-IKKβ, IKKβ, p-p65, p65 were determined by western blot. Levels of p-p65 and uPA in bone tissue were studied by immunohistochemistry. Behavior tests in this investigation included paw withdrawal latency (PWL) and the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT). Radiological analysis and micro-CT were used to study bone structure. The lesions of bone tissue were determined by HE staining. The Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) isolated from mice were used to determine the level of PAR2 pathway. RESULTS: Naringenin improved the BCP-induced bone damage based on the increases of BV/TV, Conn. D, BMD and BMC and the decrease of bone destruction score. Naringenin repressed the reductions of PWT and PWL in BCP mice. Naringenin decreased the levels of PAR2, PKC-γ, PKA and TRPV1 of DRG and reduced the levels of p-IKKβ, p-p65, and uPA in serum and bone tissue in BCP. Importantly, naringenin suppressed the enhancement of TNF-α in serum and bone tissue in BCP mice. CONCLUSION: Naringenin alleviated pain sensitization and bone damage of mice with BCP via TNF-α-mediated NF-κB/uPA/PAR2 pathway.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory, immune, and neurodegenerative diseases constitute a category of persistent and debilitating conditions affecting millions worldwide, with intertwined pathophysiological pathways. Recent research has spotlighted naturally occurring compounds like naringenin for potential therapeutic applications across multiple ailments. OBJECTIVES: This review offers an encompassing exploration of naringenin's anti-inflammatory, immune-protective, and neuroprotective mechanisms, elucidating its pharmacological targets, signal transduction pathways, safety profile, and insights from clinical investigations. METHODS: Data for this review were amassed through the scrutiny of various published studies via search engines such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Content from reputable publishers including Bentham Science, Taylor and Francis, Nature, PLOS ONE, among others, was referenced. RESULTS: Naringenin exhibits substantial anti-inflammatory effects by restraining the NF-κB signaling pathway. It activates Nrf2, renowned for its anti-inflammatory properties, inducing the release of hemeoxynase-1 by macrophages. Furthermore, naringenin treatment downregulates the expression of Th1 cytokines and inflammatory mediators. It also impedes xanthine oxidase, counteracts reactive oxygen species (ROS), scavenges superoxide radicals, mitigates the accessibility of oxygen-induced K+ erythrocytes, and reduces lipid peroxidation. Naringenin's antioxidant prowess holds promise for addressing neurological conditions. CONCLUSION: Extensive research has been undertaken to establish the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective attributes of naringenin across various medical domains, lending credence to its pharmacological utility. The principal obstacle to naringenin's adoption as a therapeutic agent remains the dearth of in vivo data. Efforts should focus on rendering naringenin delivery patient-friendly, economically viable, and technologically advanced.",

Previous studies have indicated that cadmium chloride (CdCl2) can damage organs, such as the liver, ovaries, and testicles. Naringenin (Nar) represents a flavonoid with various properties that promote the alleviation of Cd-induced damage. In this experiment, 60 chickens were divided into the control group, 150 mg/kg CdCl2 treatment group, 250 mg/kg Nar treatment group, and 150 mg/kg CdCl2 + 250 mg/kg Nar co-treatment group, which were treated for 8 weeks. Kidney tissues samples were collected to investigate kidney function, including oxidative stress (OS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy activity. Experimental results showed the decreased weight of chickens and increased relative weight of their kidneys after CdCl2 treatment. The increase in NAG, BUN, Cr, and UA activities, as well as the increase in MDA and GSH contents, and the decrease activities of T-AOC, SOD, and CAT in the kidney, manifested renal injury by OS in the chickens. TUNEL staining revealed that CdCl2 induced apoptosis in renal cells. CdCl2 upregulates the mRNA and protein expression levels of GRP78, PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, ATF6, CHOP, and LC3, and inhibited the mRNA and protein expression levels of P62 proteins, which leads to ER stress and autophagy. The CdCl2 + Nar co-treatment group exhibited alleviated CdCl2-induced kidney injury, OS, ER stress, and autophagy. Research has demonstrated that Nar reduces CdCl2-induced kidney injury through alleviation of OS, ER stress, and autophagy."

Naringenin (NRG), a natural flavonoid widely present in citrus fruits, has been reported can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system. Here, we investigate the protective effects of long-term NRG treatment on AD. The novel object recognition test and Morris water maze test reveal that NRG treatment can improve the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. Besides, we find that NRG can significantly reduce Aβ deposition, microglial and astrocytic activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in APP/PS1 mice. Results further show that NRG effectively decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS/Aβ-stimulated BV2 cells. Lastly, the molecular mechanistic study reveals that NRG attenuates neuroinflammatory responses via inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. Overall, NRG may emerge as a promising compound for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatic analysis were combined and used to explore the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of naringenin (Nar) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). METHODS: Cell counting kit-8, quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were adopted to detect the effects of Nar on the proliferation and expression of inflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated hPDLSCs, screening for the optimal anti-inflammatory concentration of Nar. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using |log2FC|≥1 and P≤0.05 as criteria. Volcano plot analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, the String database, and the MCODE module of Cytoscape were utilized to select core genes and enriched pathways. The effects on the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway were verified using ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blot. RESULTS: Appropriate concentrations of Nar could alleviate the expression of inflammatory factors and promote the proliferation of hPDLSCs stimulated by LPS. The best anti-inflammatory effect was achieved with 20 μmol/L Nar. RNA-seq showed significant enrichment of inflammation-related signaling pathways. The anti-inflammatory effect of Nar was mediated by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, similar to the effect of the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7802. CONCLUSIONS: Nar could exert its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, making it a potential therapeutic option for the adjuvant treatment of periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a premalignant condition that increases the risk for subsequent gastric cancer (GC). Traditional Chinese medicine generally plays a role in the treatment of IM, and the phytochemical naringenin used in Chinese herbal medicine has shown therapeutic potential for the treatment of gastric diseases. However, naringenin's specific effect on IM is not yet clearly understood. Therefore, this study identified potential gene targets for the treatment of IM through bioinformatics analysis and experiment validation. Two genes (MTTP and APOB) were selected as potential targets after a comparison of RNA-seq results of clinical samples, the GEO dataset (GSE78523), and naringenin-related genes from the GeneCards database. The results of both cell and animal experiments suggested that naringenin can improve the changes in the intestinal epithelial metaplasia model via MTTP/APOB expression. In summary, naringenin likely inhibits the MTTP/APOB axis and therefore inhibits IM progression. These results support the development of naringenin as an anti-IM agent and may contribute to the discovery of novel IM therapeutic targets.",

Therefore, the goal of this review is to synthesize the literature that has been done on naringenin as a possible anti-cancer agent and clarify the mechanisms of action that have been described in treatment plans for different kinds of cancer. In a variety of cancer cells, naringenin works by affecting several pathways associated with cell cycle arrest, anti-metastasis, apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, and DNA repair. It has been shown to alter several molecular targets linked to the development of cancer, such as drug transporters, transcription factors, reactive nitrogen species, reactive oxygen species, cellular kinases, and inflammatory cytokines and regulators of the cell cycle.

Numerous studies have deciphered naringenin's antioxidant and anticancer potential in human and animal studies. Naringenin (NGE) potentially suppresses cancer progression, thereby improving the health of cancer patients. The pleiotropic anticancer properties of naringenin include inhibition of the synthesis of growth factors and cytokines, inhibition of the cell cycle, and modification of several cellular signaling pathways. As an herbal remedy, naringenin has significant pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-cancer activities. The inactivation of carcinogens following treatment with pure naringenin, naringenin-loaded nanoparticles, and naringenin combined with anti-cancer agents was demonstrated by data in vitro and in vivo studies. These studies included colon cancer, lung neoplasms, breast cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate tumors, oral squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, brain tumors, skin cancer, cervical and ovarian cancers, bladder neoplasms, gastric cancer, and osteosarcoma. The effects of naringenin on processes related to inflammation, apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion in breast cancer are covered in this narrative review, along with its potential to develop novel and secure anticancer medications."

Al degrades in to nanoparticulate form in the environment due to the routine process of bioremediation in human body. Al-NPs toxicity plays key role in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration which is characterised by the development of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques which correlates to the Alzheimer's disease. This study evaluated the Al-NPs induced neurodegeneration and causative behavioral alterations due to oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage, β-amyloid aggregation, and histopathological changes in mice. Furthermore, the preventive effect of naringenin (NAR) as a potent neuroprotective flavonoid against Al-NPs induced neurodegeneration was assessed. Al-NPs were synthesized and examined using FTIR, XRD, TEM, and particle size analyzer. Mice were orally administered with Al-NPs (6 mg/kg b.w.) followed by NAR treatment (10 mg/kg b.w. per day) for 66 days. The spatial working memory was determined by novel object recognition, T-maze, Y-maze, and Morris Water Maze tests. We measured nitric oxide, advanced oxidation of protein products, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, oxidised glutathione, and acetylcholine esterase, as well as cytokines analysis, immunohistochemistry, and DNA damage. Al-NPs significantly reduced the learning memory power, increased oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant enzymatic activity, increased DNA damage, altered the levels of cytokines, and increased β-amyloid aggregation in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the mice brain. These neurobehavioral impairments, neuronal oxidative stress, and histopathological alterations were significantly attenuated by NAR supplementation. In conclusion, Al-NPs may be potent neurotoxic upon exposure and that NAR could serve as a potential preventive measure in the treatment and management of neuronal degeneration.",

      "abstract": "Liver cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by poor responses to standard therapies and therefore unfavourable clinical outcomes. Understanding the characteristics of liver cancer and developing novel therapeutic strategies are imperative. Ferroptosis, a type of programmed cell death induced by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a potential target for treatment. Naringenin, a natural compound that modulates lipid metabolism by targeting AMPK, shows promise in enhancing the efficacy of ferroptosis inducers. In this study, we utilized liver cancer cell lines and xenograft mice to explore the synergistic effects of naringenin in combination with ferroptosis inducers, examining both phenotypic outcomes and molecular mechanisms. Our study results indicate that the use of naringenin at non-toxic doses to hepatocytes can significantly enhance the anticancer effects of ferroptosis inducers (erastin, RSL3, and sorafenib). The combination index method confirmed a synergistic effect between naringenin and ferroptosis inducers. In comparison to naringenin or ferroptosis inducers alone, the combined therapy caused more robust lipid peroxidation and hence more severe ferroptotic damage to cancer cells. The inhibition of aerobic glycolysis mediated by the AMPK-PGC1α signalling axis is the key to naringenin's effect on reducing ferroptosis resistance in liver cancer, and the synergistic cytotoxic effect of naringenin and ferroptosis inducers on cancer cells was reversed after pretreatment with an AMPK inhibitor or a PGC1α inhibitor. Taken together, these findings suggest that naringenin could boost cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers, which has potential clinical translational value."

Therefore, identifying new strategies to slow the progression of brain aging is a compelling challenge. In this article, we first assessed the potential anti-aging effects of the Citrus flavanone naringenin (NAR), an activator of the enzyme sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), in a 3R-compliant and short-lived aging model (i.e., the nematode C. elegans). Then, we investigated the preventive effects of a 6-month treatment with NAR (100 mg/kg, orally) against brain aging and studied its mechanism of action in middle-aged mice. We demonstrated that NAR (100 μM) extends lifespan and improves healthspan in C. elegans. In the brain of middle-aged mice, NAR promotes the activity of metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase, cytochrome C oxidase) and increases the expression of the SIRT1 enzyme. Consistently, NAR up-regulates the expression of downstream antioxidant (Foxo3, Nrf2, Ho-1), anti-senescence (p16), and anti-inflammatory (Il-6, Il-18) markers. Our findings support NAR supplementation to slow the signs of brain aging.",

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of naringenin on CRC. METHODS: The biological and cellular properties of naringenin and its anticancer activity were evaluated in CRC. In addition, the effect of combined treatment with naringenin and 5-fluorouracil on tumor growth in vitro and in vivo was evaluated. RESULTS: The present study found that naringenin inhibits the proliferation of CRC and promote its apoptosis. Compared with the naringenin group, naringenin combined with 5-fluorouracil had significant effect on inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting its apoptosis. It is showed that naringenin activates AMPK phosphorylation and mitochondrial fusion in CRC. Naringenin combined with 5-fluorouracil significantly reduces cardiotoxicity and liver damage induced by 5-fluorouracil in nude mice bearing subcutaneous CRC tumors, and attenuates colorectal injuries in azoxymethane/DSS dextran sulfate (AOM/DSS)-induced CRC. The combination of these two drugs alters mitochondrial function by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), thereby stimulating AMPK/mTOR signaling. Mitochondrial dynamics are thereby regulated by activating the AMPK/p-AMPK pathway, and mitochondrial homeostasis is coordinated through increased mitochondrial fusion and reduced fission to activate apoptosis in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that naringenin is important for inhibiting CRC proliferation, possibly through the AMPK pathway, to regulate mitochondrial function and induce apoptosis in CRC.",

The current study examines the effect of Naringenin-loaded hybridized nanoparticles (NAR-HNPs) and NAR on depression induced by streptozotocin (STZ) in rats. NAR-HNPs formula with the highest in vitro NAR released profile, lowest polydispersity index value (0.21 ± 0.02), highest entrapment efficiency (98.7 ± 2.01%), as well as an acceptable particle size and zeta potential of 415.2 ± 9.54 nm and 52.8 ± 1.04 mV, respectively, was considered the optimum formulation. It was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, examined using a transmission electron microscope, and a stability study was conducted at different temperatures to monitor its stability efficiency showing that NAR-HNP formulation maintains stability at 4 °C. The selected formulation was subjected to an acute toxicological test, a pharmacokinetic analysis, and a Diabetes mellitus (DM) experimental model. STZ (50 mg/kg) given as a single i.p. rendered rats diabetic. Diabetic rat groups were allocated into 4 groups: one group received no treatment, while the remaining three received oral doses of unloaded HNPs, NAR (50 mg/kg), NAR-HNPs (50 mg/kg) and NAR (50 mg/kg) + peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) antagonist, GW9662 (1mg/kg, i.p.) for three weeks. Additional four non-diabetic rat groups received: distilled water (normal), free NAR, and NAR-HNPs, respectively for three weeks. NAR and NAR-HNPs reduced immobility time in forced swimming test and serum blood glucose while increasing serum insulin level. They also reduced cortical and hippocampal 5-hydroxyindoeacetic acid, 3,4-Dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid, malondialdehyde, NLR family pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) and interleukin-1beta content while raised serotonin, nor-epinephrine, dopamine and glutathione level. PPAR-γ gene expression was elevated too.

ABSTRACT: In the recent years, drought stress is considered as one of the most important stressful conditions for agricultural plants. Reducing the effects of drought on plants is a crucial need nowadays, which calls for innovative methods. Naringenin is one of the most known plant flavonoids with antioxidant properties. In the present work, a naringenin based nanocomposite containing carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as carrier (CMC-Nar) with an average size of 65 nm were synthesized by coacervation method. In order to investigate the effect of CMC nanocomposites containing naringenin (CMC-Nar) and pure naringenin in modulating the effects of drought stress, cultivation of Cuminum cyminum (varieties: Isfahan and Kashan) was carried out in greenhouse conditions. Drought stress was imposed as 30% of the field capacity. Various physiological, biochemical, and phytochemical assays were performed after treating the plants in drought conditions (30%). The results indicated that treatment of nanocomposites (CMC-Nar) and pure naringenin at drought conditions increased growth and photosynthetic parameters such as germination, shoot and root fresh weight, shoot dry weight, and chlorophyll content of the Cumin. Stress markers such as malondialdehyde, H2O2, and electrolyte leakage decreased under the treatment of narinjenin and especially nanocomposites (CMC-Nar) under drought conditions. Moreover, under same condition and treatments, some biochemical parameters including soluble sugar and total protein increased but the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the level of free amino acids has gone down. Compatible Solutes (Proline and glycine betaine) also increased. There was an increase in phytochemical parameters such as total phenols, flavonoids, anthocyanin, and tannins under naringenin and nanocomposites (CMC-Nar) treatment in drought conditions. In general, nanocomposites and pure naringenin reduced the harmful effects of drought stress, and the ameliorating impacts of nanocomposites (CMC-Nar) are more than pure naringenin. According to the results: In most cases, the impact of drought stress was modulated to a greater extent by (CMC-Nar) nanocomposites in the Isfahan variety compared to the Kashan variety. This research tries to propose a new method to reduce the effects of drought stress on Cuminum cyminum.

The epigenetic, evolutionary, and metabolic effects of mitochondrial complex IΙ are the primary concerns of our review. Provides novel insight into the vital role of naringenin (NAR) as an intriguing flavonoid phytochemical in cancer treatment. NAR is a significant phytochemical that is a member of the flavanone group of polyphenols and is mostly present in citrus fruits, such as grapefruits, as well as other fruits and vegetables, like tomatoes and cherries, as well as foods produced from medicinal herbs. The evidence that is now available indicates that NAR, an herbal remedy, has significant pharmacological qualities and anti-cancer effects. Through a variety of mechanisms, including the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, restriction of angiogenesis, and modulation of several signaling pathways, NAR prevents the growth of cancer. However, the hydrophobic and crystalline structure of NAR is primarily responsible for its instability, limited oral bioavailability, and water solubility. Furthermore, there is no targeting and a high rate of breakdown in an acidic environment. These shortcomings are barriers to its efficient medical application. Improvement targeting NAR to mitochondrial complex ΙΙ by loading it on chitosan nanoparticles is a promising strategy."

Furthermore, mitochondrial dynamics have been implicated to play a critical role in these processes. For the first time, we describe in this study how UVB-induced aberrant mitochondrial dynamics and inflammation interact in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Our findings demonstrated that UV-B irradiation induced -impairment in mitochondrial dynamics by increasing mitochondrial fragmentation in HDFs. Imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics lead to the activation of NFкB and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The current study further aimed to investigate the protective effect of Naringenin (a naturally occurring flavonoid isolated from Sea buckthorn fruit pulp) against UV-B-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and inflammation in HDFs and Balb/c mice. Although Naringenin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential, its effects and mechanisms of action on UVB-induced inflammation remained unclear. We observed that Naringenin restored the UV-B-induced imbalance in mitochondrial fission and fusion in HDFs. It also inhibited the phosphorylation of NFкB and reduced the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Naringenin also alleviated UV-B-induced oxidative stress by scavenging the reactive oxygen species and up-regulating the cellular antioxidant enzymes (Catalase and Nrf2). Topical application of Naringenin to the dorsal skin of Balb/c mice exposed to UV-B radiation prevented mitochondrial fragmentation and progression of inflammatory responses. Naringenin treatment prevented neutrophil infiltration and epidermal thickening in mice's skin. These findings provide an understanding for further research into impaired mitochondrial dynamics as a therapeutic target for UV-B-induced inflammation. Our findings imply that Naringenin could be developed as a therapeutic remedy against UVB-induced inflammation.",

Naringenin (NAR) is a dietary flavonoid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which was implemented against AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity to ascertain its neuroprotective efficacy. Experimental neurotoxicity in mice was induced by exposure of AlCl3 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) followed by treatment with NAR (10 mg/kg, p.o.) for a total of 63 days. Assessed the morphometric, learning memory dysfunction (novel object recognition, T- and Y-maze tests), neuronal oxidative stress, and histopathological alteration in different regions of the brain, mainly cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. AlCl3 significantly suppressed the spatial learning and memory power which were notably improved by administration of NAR. The levels of oxidative stress parameters nitric oxide, advanced oxidation of protein products, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, and the activity of acetylcholine esterase were altered 1.5-3 folds by AlCl3 significantly. Treatment of NAR remarkably restored the level of oxidative stress parameters and maintained the antioxidant defense system. AlCl3 suppressed the expression of neuronal proliferation marker NeuN that was restored by NAR treatment which may be a plausible mechanism. NAR showed therapeutic efficacy as a natural supplement against aluminum-intoxicated memory impairments and histopathological alteration through a mechanism involving an antioxidant defense system and neuronal proliferation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) commonly causes neuropathic pain, but its pathogenesis remains unclear, and effective therapies are lacking. Naringenin, a natural dihydroflavonoid compound, has anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive and anti-tumour activities. However, the effects of naringenin on chemotherapy-induced pain and chemotherapy effectiveness remain unexplored. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Female and male mouse models of chemotherapy-induced pain were established using paclitaxel. Effects of naringenin were assessed on pain induced by paclitaxel or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and on CGRP expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord tissue. Additionally, we examined peripheral macrophage infiltration, glial activation, c-fos expression, DRG neuron excitability, microglial M1/M2 polarization, and phosphorylation of spinal NF-κB. Furthermore, we investigated the synergic effect and related mechanisms of naringenin and paclitaxel on cell survival of cancer cells in vitro. KEY RESULTS: Systemic administration of naringenin attenuated paclitaxel-induced pain in both sexes. Naringenin reduced paclitaxel-enhanced CGRP expression in DRGs and the spinal cord, and alleviated CGRP-induced pain in naïve mice of both sexes. Naringenin mitigated macrophage infiltration and reversed paclitaxel-elevated c-fos expression and DRG neuron excitability. Naringenin decreased spinal glial activation and NF-κB phosphorylation in both sexes but influenced microglial M1/M2 polarization only in females. Co-administration of naringenin with paclitaxel enhanced paclitaxel's anti-tumour effect, impeded by an apoptosis inhibitor. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Naringenin's anti-nociceptive mechanism involves CGRP signalling and neuroimmunoregulation. Furthermore, naringenin facilitates paclitaxel's anti-tumour action, possibly involving apoptosis. This study demonstrates naringenin's potential as a supplementary treatment in cancer therapy by mitigating side effects and potentiating efficacy of chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the potential protective role of naringenin against the harmful effects induced by cadmium in KGN cell line. Cell viability was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 assay. Caspase-3/-9 activities were determined by caspase-3/-9 activity assay kits, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was detected by ROS-Glo™ H2O2 Assay, antioxidant capacity was determined by a total antioxidant capacity assay kit. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP level, and ATP synthase activity were determined by JC-1, ATP assay kit, and ATP synthase activity assay kit, respectively. The mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Cadmium reduced cell viability and increased caspase-3/-9 activities in a concentration-dependent manner. Naringenin improved cell viability and reduced caspase-3/-9 activities in cadmium-stimulated KGN cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Cadmium diminished the antioxidant capacity, increased ROS production, and induced mitochondrial dysfunction in KGN cells. These effects were ameliorated by naringenin treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, naringenin reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in KGN cells exposed to cadmium. SIRT1 knockdown downregulated its expression in KGN cells and compromised the protective effects of naringenin on cell viability and caspase-3/-9 activities in cadmium-stimulated KGN cells. Naringenin prevented the reduction of MMP, ATP levels, and ATP synthase activity in cadmium-stimulated KGN cells in a concentration-dependent manner. However, these protective effects were significantly reversed by SIRT1 knockdown. In conclusion, this study suggests that naringenin protects against cadmium-induced damage by regulating oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and inflammation in KGN cells, with SIRT1 playing a potential mediating role.",

      "abstract": "Acute liver injury (ALI) refers to the damage to the liver cells of patients due to drugs, food, and diseases. In this work, we used a network pharmacology approach to analyze the relevant targets and pathways of the active ingredients in Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP) for the treatment of ALI and conducted systematic validation through in vivo and in vitro experiments. The network pharmacologic results predicted that naringenin (NIN) was the main active component of CRP in the treatment of ALI. GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment showed that its mechanism may be related to the regulation of PPARA signaling pathway, PPARG signaling pathway, AKT1 signaling pathway, MAPK3 signaling pathway and other signaling pathways. The results of in vivo experiments showed that (NIN) could reduce the liver lesions, liver adipose lesions, hepatocyte injury and apoptosis in mice with APAP-induced ALI, and reduce the oxidative stress damage of mouse liver cells and the inflammation-related factors to regulate ALI. In vitro experiments showed that NIN could inhibit the proliferation, oxidative stress and inflammation of APAP-induced LO2 cells, promote APAP-induced apoptosis of LO2 cells, and regulate the expression of apoptotic genes in acute liver injury. Further studies showed that NIN inhibited APAP-induced ALI mainly by regulating the PPARA-dependent signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study provides a preliminary theoretical basis for the screening of active compounds in CRP for the prevention and treatment of ALI.",

This study aims to investigate whether NAR has protective effects against radiation-induced intestinal injury and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice are exposed to a single dose of 13 Gy X-ray total abdominal irradiation (TAI), then gavaged with NAR for 7 days. NAR treatment prolongs the survival rate, protects crypts and villi from damage, alleviates the level of radiation-induced inflammation, and mitigates intestinal barrier damage in the irradiated mice. Additionally, NAR reduces immune cell infiltration and intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis. NAR also shows radioprotective effects in human colon cancer cells (HCT116) and human intestinal epithelial cells (NCM460). It reduces cell damage by reducing intracellular calcium ion levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. NAR-mediated radioprotection is associated with the downregulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6), and inhibition of apoptosis pathway. Notably, treatment with NAR fails to further increase the protective effects of the TRPV6 inhibitor 2-APB, indicating that TRPV6 inhibition is essential for NAR activity. CONCLUSION: NAR inhibits the apoptosis pathway by downregulating TRPV6 and reducing calcium ion level, thereby alleviating RIII. Therefore, NAR is a promising therapeutic drug for RIII.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a debilitating mental disease that negatively impacts individuals' lives and society. Novel hypotheses have been recently proposed to improve our understanding of depression pathogenesis. Impaired neuroplasticity and upregulated neuro-inflammation add-on to the disturbance in monoamine neurotransmitters and therefore require novel anti-depressants to target them simultaneously. Recent reports demonstrate the antidepressant effect of the anti-diabetic drug liraglutide. Similarly, the natural flavonoid naringenin has shown both anti-diabetic and anti-depressant effects. However, the neuro-pharmacological mechanisms underlying their actions remain understudied. The study aims to evaluate the antidepressant effects and neuroprotective mechanisms of liraglutide, naringenin or a combination of both. Depression was induced in mice by administering dexamethasone (32 mcg/kg) for seven consecutive days. Liraglutide (200 mcg/kg), naringenin (50 mg/kg) and a combination of both were administered either simultaneously or after induction of depression for twenty-eight days. Behavioral and molecular assays were used to assess the progression of depressive symptoms and biomarkers. Liraglutide and naringenin alone or in combination alleviated the depressive behavior in mice, manifested by decrease in anxiety, anhedonia, and despair. Mechanistically, liraglutide and naringenin improved neurogenesis, decreased neuroinflammation and comparably restored the monoamines levels to that of the reference drug escitalopram. The drugs protected mice from developing depression when given simultaneously with dexamethasone. Collectively, the results highlight the usability of liraglutide and naringenin in the treatment of depression in mice and emphasize the different pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of depression.",

Here, we elucidated the effects of naringenin on monocyte/macrophage endothelial infiltration and vascular inflammation. We found naringenin inhibited oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α toward an M2 macrophage phenotype and inhibited oxLDL-induced TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) membrane translocation and downstream NF-κB transcriptional activity. Results from flow cytometric analysis showed that naringenin reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the aorta of high-fat-diet-treated ApoE-deficient mice. The aortic cytokine levels were also inhibited in naringenin-treated mice. Further, we found that naringenin reduced lipid raft clustering and acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) membrane gathering and inhibited the TLR4 and NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox membrane recruitment, which reduced the inflammatory response. Recombinant ASMase treatment or overexpression of ASMase abolished the naringenin function and activated macrophage and vascular inflammation. We conclude that naringenin inhibits ASMase-mediated lipid raft redox signaling to attenuate macrophage activation and vascular inflammation.",

However, current strategies targeting estrogen signaling pay little attention to estradiol metabolism in the liver and is usually challenged by treatment failure. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the natural compound naringenin (NAR) inhibited HR+ breast cancer growth by activating estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) expression in the liver. Nevertheless, the poor water solubility, low bio-barrier permeability, and non-specific distribution limited its clinical application, particularly for oral administration. Here, a novel nano endocrine drug NAR-cell penetrating peptide-galactose nanoparticles (NCG) is reported. We demonstrated that NCG presented specific liver targeting and increased intestinal barrier permeability in both cell and zebrafish xenotransplantation models. Furthermore, NCG showed liver targeting and enterohepatic circulation in mouse breast cancer xenografts following oral administration. Notably, the cancer inhibition efficacy of NCG was superior to that of both NAR and the positive control tamoxifen, and was accompanied by increased hepatic EST expression and reduced estradiol levels in the liver, blood, and tumor tissue. Moreover, few side effects were observed after NCG treatment. Our findings reveal NCG as a promising candidate for endocrine therapy and highlight hepatic EST targeting as a novel therapeutic strategy for HR+ breast cancer.",

The poor prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer and the lack of therapeutic options pose an even greater challenge to the clinical management of patients. This study aimed to identify potential molecular targets associated with the progression of rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer and examine the efficacy of naringenin nanoparticles targeting cyclin B1. Mendelian randomizatio analysis revealed that rheumatoid arthritis has a positive correlation with the risk of lung cancer. Cyclin B1 was significantly upregulated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer and was significantly overexpressed in synovial tissue fibroblasts. Furthermore, the overexpression of cyclin B1 in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes, which promotes their proliferation and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, can significantly contribute to the growth and infiltration of lung cancer cells. Importantly, our prepared naringenin nanoparticles targeting cyclin B1 effectively attenuated proliferation and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition by blocking cells at the G2/M phase. In vivo experiments, naringenin nanoparticles targeting cyclin B1 significantly alleviated the development of collagen-induced arthritis and lung orthotopic tumors. Collectively, our results reveal that naringenin nanoparticles targeting cyclin B1 can suppress the progression of rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer by inhibiting fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition.

      "abstract": "Naringenin, a natural dihydrochalcone flavonoid, exhibits diverse pharmacological properties. This study investigates the hypolipidemic effects of Nar-NPs on obese mice. The characteristics of Nar-NPs, including morphology, particle size, zeta potential, UV-vis, and FT-IR spectra, were examined. The anti-obesity properties of Nar-NPs were evaluated in obese rats, considering LD50, 1/20 LD50, and 1/50 LD50 for treatment preparation. Results indicated that synthesized Nar-NPs were uniform, spherical, and well-dispersed, with a size of 130.06 ± 1.98 nm and with a zeta potential of -25.6 ± 0.8 mV. Nar-NPs exhibited enhancement in the cumulative release of naringenin (56.87 ± 2.45 %) as compared to pure naringenin suspension 87.83 ± 1.84 % in 24 h of the study. The LD50 of Nar-NPs was determined as 412.5 mg/kg.b.w. HFD induced elevated glycemic, oxidative stress, and inflammatory biomarkers while reducing HDL-C, GSH, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Administration of Nar-NPs significantly mitigated body weight, glucose, insulin, leptin, TC, TG, SREBP1c, pAMPK, PPAR-α, as well as vanin-1, MCP-1, and iNOS mRNA gene expression. Histological investigations supported the biochemical and PCR findings. In a nutshell, the study suggests that the Nar-NPs could serve as a promising and viable pharmacological strategy for the treatment of obesity-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endotoxemia is a severe and dangerous clinical syndrome that results in elevated morbidity, especially in intensive care units. Neonates are particularly susceptible to endotoxemia due to their immature immune systems. There are few effective treatments for neonatal endotoxemia. One group of compounds with potential in the treatment of neonatal inflammatory diseases such as endotoxemia is the flavonoids, mainly due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Among these, naringenin (NGN) is a citrus flavonoid which has already been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-nociceptive and anti-cancer effects. Unfortunately, its clinical application is limited by its low solubility and bioavailability. However, cyclodextrins (CDs) have been widely used to improve the solubility of nonpolar drugs and enhance the bioavailability of these natural products. OBJECTIVE: We, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of NGN non-complexed and complexed with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) on neonatal endotoxemia injuries in a rodent model and describe the probable molecular mechanisms involved in NGN activities. METHOD: We used exposure to a bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce neonatal endotoxemia in the mice. RESULTS: It was found that NGN (100 mg/kg i.p.) exposure during the neonatal period reduced leukocyte migration and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) levels in the lungs, heart, kidneys or cerebral cortex. In addition, NGN upregulated IL-10 production in the lungs and kidneys of neonate mice. The administration of NGN also enhanced antioxidant enzyme catalase and SOD activity, reduced lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation and increased the reduced sulfhydryl groups in an organ-dependent manner, attenuating the oxidative damage caused by LPS exposure. NGN decreased ERK1/2, p38MAPK and COX-2 activation in the lungs of neonate mice. Moreover, NGN complexed with HPβCD was able to increase the animal survival rate. CONCLUSION: NGN attenuated inflammatory and oxidative damage in the lungs, heart and kidneys caused by neonatal endotoxemia through the MAPK signaling pathways regulation. Our results show that NGN has beneficial effects against neonatal endotoxemia and could be useful in the treatment of neonatal inflammatory injuries.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Melanoma is a prevalent malignant tumor that arises from melanocytes. The treatment of malignant melanoma has become challenging due to the development of drug resistance. It is, therefore, imperative to identify novel therapeutic drug candidates for controlling malignant melanoma. Naringenin is a flavonoid abundant in oranges and other citrus fruits and recognized for its numerous medicinal benefits. The objective of the study was to assess the anti-carcinogenic potential of naringenin by evaluating its ability to regulate the cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its effect on mitochondrial function and apoptosis in melanoma cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability, intracellular ROS levels, cell apoptosis, and mitochondrial functions were evaluated. RESULTS: Naringenin decreased melanoma cell viability and triggered generation of ROS, leading to cell apoptosis. In addition, it stimulated mitochondrial damage in melanoma cells by elevating the levels of Ca2+ and ROS in the mitochondria and decreasing cellular ATP. Naringenin stimulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins, including phospho p53, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9, in melanoma cells in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, it reduced the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Naringenin triggered cell apoptosis by phosphorylating c-Jun N-terminal kinase and stimulating cellular autophagy. CONCLUSION: Naringenin caused oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, and activated autophagy in melanoma cells, leading to cell apoptosis. These findings indicate the potential of naringenin as a new therapeutic candidate for melanoma.",

However, necrosis resulting from ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury in the distal part of the flap can severely limit the clinical application of the flap. Studies have revealed that naringenin reduces pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, inhibits oxidative stress, and promotes autophagy. In this study, the effects of Naringenin on flap viability and its underlying mechanism were evaluated. METHODS: Mice with random skin flaps were randomly allocated to control, Naringenin, and Naringenin + 3-methyladenine groups. On postoperative day 7, flap tissues were collected to estimate angiogenesis, necroptosis, apoptosis, pyroptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy via hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The results revealed that naringenin promoted the viability of the random flaps as well as angiogenesis, while inhibiting oxidative stress and decreasing pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. These effects were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that naringenin treatment could promote flap survival by inhibiting pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and alleviating oxidative stress, caused by the activation of autophagy.",

The mice were randomly divided into four groups (n=6 for each group): (1) negative control group, treated with absolute ethanol alcohol as the vehicle (2) minoxidil (5%) treated group; (3) 0.5% naringenin treated group, and (4) naringenin plus minoxidil treated group. The treatment groups had significantly higher total antioxidant capacity in tissue levels and increased serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor compared to the control group. No significant differences were observed in keratinocyte growth factor tissue levels between the treatment and control groups. However, the medication significantly increased hair growth, hair follicle diameter expansion, and hair follicle quantity compared to the control group.

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a severe epidemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies have found that patients do not completely recover from acute infections, but instead, suffer from a variety of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as long COVID. The effects of long COVID can be far-reaching, with a duration of up to six months and a range of symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, immune dysregulation, microbiota dysbiosis, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, myocarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, cough, diabetes, pain, reproductive dysfunction, and thrombus formation. However, recent studies have shown that naringenin and naringin have palliative effects on various COVID-19 sequelae. Flavonoids such as naringin and naringenin, commonly found in fruits and vegetables, have various positive effects, including reducing inflammation, preventing viral infections, and providing antioxidants. This article discusses the molecular mechanisms and clinical effects of naringin and naringenin on treating the above diseases. It proposes them as potential drugs for the treatment of long COVID, and it can be inferred that naringin and naringenin exhibit potential as extended long COVID medications, in the future likely serving as nutraceuticals or clinical supplements for the comprehensive alleviation of the various manifestations of COVID-19 complications."

Naringenin, a natural flavonoid compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, holds promise as a potential treatment for sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction. This study investigated the pharmacological effects of naringenin on septic cardiomyopathy. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that naringenin improved cardiomyocyte damage. Network pharmacology and database analysis revealed that HIF-1α is a key target protein of naringenin. Elevated expression of HIF-1α was observed in damaged cardiomyocytes, and the HIF-1α inhibitor effectively protected against LPS-induced cardiomyocyte damage. Molecular docking studies confirmed the direct binding between naringenin and HIF-1α protein. Importantly, our findings demonstrated that naringenin did not provide additional attenuation of cardiomyocyte injury on the biases of HIF-1α inhibitor treatment. In conclusion, this study proves that naringenin protects against septic cardiomyopathy through HIF-1α signaling. Naringenin is a promising therapeutic candidate for treating septic cardiomyopathy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) dasatinib, a multitarget inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases, has been licensed for the treatment of Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. Many citrus-based foods include the flavonoid naringenin, which is commonly available. Dasatinib is a Cyp3a4, P-gp, and Bcrp1 substrate, which makes it sensitive to potential food-drug interactions. The concurrent use of naringenin may change the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib, which could result in adverse effects and toxicity. The present investigation examined the impact of naringenin on the pharmacokinetics interactions of DAS and proposes a possible interaction mechanism in Wistar rats. METHODS: Rats were provided with a single oral dose of dasatinib (25 mg/kg) with or without naringenin pretreatment (150 mg/kg p.o. daily for 7 days, n = 6 in each group). Dasatinib was quantified in plasma by UHPLC MS/MS assay. Noncompartmental analysis was used to compute the pharmacokinetic parameters, and immunoblot was used to assess the protein expression in the hepatic and intestinal tissues. RESULTS: Following 7 days of naringenin pretreatment, the plasma mean concentration of dasatinib was enhanced compared with without pretreatment. In rats that were pretreated with naringenin, the pharmacokinetics of the orally administered dasatinib (25 mg/kg) was shown to be significantly different from that of dasatinib given without pretreatment (p < 0.05). There was a significant enhancement in pharmacokinetic parameters elimination half-life (T1/2), time to maximum concentration ( Tmax), maximum concentration )Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-t), area under the moment curve (AUMC0-∞), and mean residence time (MRT) by 28.41%, 50%, 103.54%, 72.64%, 115.08%, and 15.19%, respectively (p < 0.05) and suppression in elimination rate constant (Kel), volume of distribution (Vd), and clearance (CL) by 21.09%, 31.13%, and 46.25%, respectively, in comparison with dasatinib alone group (p < 0.05). The enhancement in dasatinib bioavailability and systemic exposure resulted from the significant inhibition of Cyp3a2, Mdr1/P-gp, and Bcrp1 expression and suppression of the dasatinib hepatic and intestinal metabolism, which enhanced the rate of dasatinib absorption and decreased its elimination. CONCLUSION: Concurrent use of naringenin-containing supplements, herbs, or foods with dasatinib may cause serious and potentially life-threatening drug interactions. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical significance of these findings.",

      "abstract": "Background: As lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, the development of new medicines is a crucial endeavor. Naringenin, a flavanone derivative, possesses anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties and has been reported to have cytotoxic effects on various cancer cells. The current study investigated the underlying molecular mechanism by which naringenin induces cell death in lung cancer. Methods: The expression of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and autophagy markers in H1299 and A459 lung cancer cells was evaluated using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay (TUNEL), Western blot, Annexin V/PI stain, PI stain, acridine orange staining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using fluorescence microscopy, DALGreen was used to observe the degradation of p62, a GFP-LC3 plasmid was used to evaluate puncta formation, and a pcDNA3-GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3ΔG plasmid was used to evaluate autophagy flux. Furthermore, the anti-cancer effect of naringenin was evaluated in a subcutaneous H1299 cell xenograft model. Results: Naringenin treatment of lung cancer cells (H1299 and A459) reduced cell viability and induced cell cycle arrest. Pretreatment of cells with ROS scavengers (N-acetylcysteine or catalase) suppressed the naringenin-induced cleavage of apoptotic protein and restored cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Naringenin also triggered autophagy by mediating ROS generation, thereby activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. ROS inhibition not only inhibited naringenin-induced autophagic puncta formation but also decreased the ratio of microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 II (LC3II)/LC3I and activity of the AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, naringenin suppressed tumor growth and promoted apoptosis in the xenograft mouse model. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the potent anti-cancer effects of naringenin on lung cancer cells, thereby providing valuable insights for developing small-molecule drugs that can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagic cell death.",

In this study, the effects of naringenin on oxidative stress and apoptosis in the liver and kidney of rats exposed to mercury chloride were investigated. In the study, 41 2-month-old male Wistar-Albino rats were divided into five groups. Accordingly, group 1 was set as control group, group 2 as naringenin-100, group 3 as mercury chloride, group 4 as mercury chloride + naringenin-50, and group 5 as mercury chloride + naringenin-100. For the interventions, 1 mL/kg saline was administered to the control, 0.4 mg/kg/day mercury (II) chloride to the mercury chloride groups by i.p., and 50 and 100 mg/kg/day naringenin prepared in corn oil to the naringenin groups by gavage. All the interventions lasted for 20 days. Mercury chloride administration was initiated 1 h following the administration of naringenin. When mercury chloride and the control group were compared, a significant increase in plasma urea, liver and kidney malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, in kidney superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities (p < .001), and a significant decrease in liver and kidney glutathione (GSH) levels (p < .001), in liver catalase (CAT) activity (p < .01) were observed. In addition, histopathological changes and a significant increase in caspase-3 levels were detected (p < .05). When mercury chloride and treatment groups were compared, the administration of naringenin caused a decrease aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < .01), urea, creatinine levels (p < .001) in plasma, MDA levels in liver and kidney, SOD, GSH-Px, GST activities in kidney (p < .001), and increased GSH levels in liver and kidney. The addition of naringenin-100 increased GSH levels above the control (p < .001). The administration of naringenin was also decreased histopathological changes and caspase-3 levels (p < .05). Accordingly, it was determined that naringenin is protective and therapeutic against mercury chloride-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the liver and kidney, and 100 mg/kg naringenin is more effective in preventing histopathological changes and apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "The current study focuses on the development of gelatin-coated polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers co-loaded with luliconazole and naringenin for accelerated healing of infected diabetic wounds. Inherently, PCL nanofibers have excellent biocompatibility and biodegradation profiles but lack bioadhesion characteristics, which limits their use as dressing materials. So, coating them with a biocompatible and hydrophilic material like gelatin can improve bioadhesion. The preparation of nanofibers was done with the electrospinning technique. The solid state characterization and in-vitro performance assessment of nanofibers indicate the formation of uniformly interconnected nanofibers of 200-400 nm in diameter with smooth surface topography, excellent drug entrapment, and a surface pH of 5.6-6.8. The antifungal study showed that the nanofiber matrix exhibits excellent biofilm inhibition activity against several strains of Candida. Further, in-vivo assessment of nanofiber performance on C. albicans infected wounds in diabetic rats indicated accelerated wound healing efficacy in comparison to gauge-treated groups. Additionally, a higher blood flow and rapid re-epithelialization of wound tissue in the treatment group corroborated with the results obtained in the wound closure study. Overall, the developed dual-drug-loaded electrospun nanofiber mats have good compatibility, surface properties, and excellent wound healing potential, which can provide an extra edge in the management of complex diabetic wounds.",

Increased energy expenditure via WAT browning is a novel therapeutic strategy for treating obesity. Naringenin (NAR) reduces inflammation and lipogenesis in obesity and attenuates estrogen deficiency-associated metabolic disorders; however, its role in WAT browning remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated NAR ability to inhibit estrogen deficiency-associated obesity in vivo using a rat model and in vitro using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. KEY FINDINGS: NAR significantly decreased the body weight and WAT mass of rats. O2 consumption, CO2 production, and energy expenditure were significantly lower in the OVX group than in the sham group, but NAR treatment reversed these effects of OVX. NAR treatment markedly improved glucose intolerance and lipid profiles as well as leptin, adiponectin, and irisin levels. NAR upregulated markers of browning and mitochondrial biogenesis in inguinal WAT. Moreover, it enhanced markers of mitochondrial fusion and inhibited fission via activating the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. Similar results were observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, NAR-induced mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion were suppressed by dorsomorphin (an AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor). SIGNIFICANCE: NAR alleviates obesity and metabolic dysfunction through the induction of WAT browning achieved via the modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase-regulated mitochondrial dynamics in WATs. NAR supplementation may therefore represent a potential intervention for preventing postmenopausal adipose tissue dysregulation.",

      "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Traditional treatment methods have become limited. Naringenin, a flavonoid abundant in various fruits and herbal medicines, has demonstrated anti-tumor properties among other effects. This research undertook to elucidate the mechanism of naringenin in the context of cervical cancer treatment by leveraging network pharmacology and performing experimental validation. Initial steps involved predicting potential naringenin targets and subsequently screening for overlaps between these targets and those related to cervical cancer, followed by analysis of their interrelationships. Molecular docking was subsequently utilized to verify the binding effect of the central target. Within the framework of network pharmacology, it was discovered that naringenin might possess anti-cancer properties specific to cervical cancer. Following this, the anti-tumor effects of naringenin on Hela cell viability, migration, and invasion were assessed employing CCK-8, transwell, wound healing assays, and western blotting. Experimental data indicated that naringenin attenuates the migration and invasion of Hela cells via downregulation EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Thus, our findings suggest that naringenin has therapeutic impacts on cervical cancer via multiple mechanisms, primarily by inhibiting the migration and invasion through the EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This study offers fresh insights for future clinical studies.",

Natural dietary flavonoids are being utilized as a newer pharmaceutical approach against various acute and chronic diseases. Naringenin (NAR) has shown efficient therapeutic properties, including effects against metal toxicities. However, the protective efficacy of NAR on aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced hepato-renal toxicity needs investigation as aluminum has shown serious environmental toxicity and bioaccumulation behavior. In this study, mice were treated with AlCl3 (10 mg/kg b.w./day) to assess toxicities, and a group of mice were co-treated with NAR (10 mg/kg b.w./day) to assess the protective effects of NAR against hepato-nephrotoxicity. The levels of blood serum enzymes, oxidative stress biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, and the apoptosis marker caspase-3 were measured using histological examinations. NAR treatment in AlCl3-treated mice resulted in maintained levels of liver and kidney function enzymes and lipid profiles. NAR treatment attenuated oxidative stress by regulating the levels of nitric oxide, advance oxidation of protein products, protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation. NAR also replenished reduced antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and reduced the levels of glutathione and oxidized glutathione. NAR regulated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and elevated the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ). The histological study further confirmed the protective effects of NAR against AlCl3-induced hepato-renal alterations. NAR decreased the expression of caspase-3 as a mechanism of protective effects against apoptotic damage in the liver and kidney of AlCl3-treated mice. In summary, this study demonstrated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of NAR, leading to the suppression of AlCl3-triggered hepato-renal apoptosis and histological alterations. The results suggest that aluminum toxicity needs to be monitored in daily life usage, and supplementation of the natural dietary flavonoid naringenin may help maintain liver and kidney health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alveolar macrophages are one of the momentous regulators in pulmonary inflammatory responses, which can secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) packing miRNAs. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, is associated with cigarette smoke-induced lung injury, and EVs have been reported to regulate ferroptosis by transporting intracellular iron. However, the regulatory mechanism of alveolar macrophage-derived EVs has not been clearly illuminated in smoking-related pulmonary ferroptosis. Despite the known anti-ferroptosis effects of naringenin in lung injury, whether naringenin controls EVs-mediated ferroptosis has not yet been explored. PURPOSE: We explore the effects of EVs from cigarette smoke-stimulated alveolar macrophages in lung epithelial ferroptosis, and elucidate the EV miRNA-mediated pharmacological mechanism of naringenin. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Differential and ultracentrifugation were conducted to extract EVs from different alveolar macrophages treatment groups in vitro. Both intratracheal instilled mice and treated epithelial cells were used to investigate the roles of EVs from alveolar macrophages involved in ferroptosis. Small RNA sequencing analysis was performed to distinguish altered miRNAs in EVs. The ferroptotic effects of EV miRNAs were examined by applying dual-Luciferase reporter assay and miRNA inhibitor transfection experiment. RESULTS: Here, we firstly reported that EVs from cigarette smoke extract-induced alveolar macrophages (CSE-EVs) provoked pulmonary epithelial ferroptosis. The ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 treatment reversed these changes in vitro. Moreover, EVs from naringenin and CSE co-treated alveolar macrophages (CSE+Naringenin-EVs) markedly attenuated the lung epithelial ferroptosis compared with CSE-EVs. Notably, we identified miR-23a-3p as the most dramatically changed miRNA among Normal-EVs, CSE-EVs, and CSE+Naringenin-EVs. Further experimental investigation showed that ACSL4, a pro-ferroptotic gene leading to lipid peroxidation, was negatively regulated by miR-23a-3p. The inhibition of miR-23a-3p diminished the efficacy of CSE+Naringenin-EVs. CONCLUSION: Our findings firstly provided evidence that naringenin elevated the EV miR-23a-3p level from CSE-induced alveolar macrophages, thereby inhibiting the mouse lung epithelial ferroptosis via targeting ACSL4, and further complemented the mechanism of cigarette-induced lung injury and the protection of naringenin in a paracrine manner. The administration of miR-23a-3p-enriched EVs has the potential to ameliorate pulmonary ferroptosis.",

RESULTS: The results showed that naringenin significantly induced apoptosis in CAL-27 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, naringenin-induced apoptosis was mediated through the upregulation of Bid and downregulation of Bcl-xl, which led to increased generation of ROS.

However, there is currently no effective therapeutic medication available for the treatment of PEDV. Natural compounds are a hot topic for researching and screening antiviral lead compounds due to their abundant sources, varied activities, and low toxicity. In this study, a total of 6 compounds from different plant sources were selected for in vitro anti-PEDV screening, including chrysin, naringenin, soy isoflavone, glycyrrhetinic acid, oleanolic acid, and geniposide. Then two active compounds, chrysin and naringenin, were further evaluated on PEDV infected cells at different stage. And the anti-PEDV mechanism was analyzed by molecule docking and molecular dynamics. The results showed that both chrysin and naringenin showed the most significant anti-PEDV activity by increasing the cell viability and decreasing the virus copy number. Both natural compounds could inhibit viral titer, mRNA and protein levels in the prophylactic and post-viral entry stages of PEDV infection. Furthermore, chrysin and naringenin mainly interacted with viral replicase proteins such as 3CLpro and PLP-2 through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces. The complexes formed by chrysin and naringenin with the two PEDV replication proteases had high stability. These results suggested that chrysin and naringenin may exert antiviral effects by interacting with the virus 3CLpro protein or PLP2 protein, thereby affecting their role in the formation of PEDV non-structural proteins or interfering with virus replication. This study lays the foundation for developing chrysin and naringenin as novel anti-PEDV therapeutic drugs."

Arginine-glycine- aspartate (RGD) is a tripeptidic sequence used as an integrin ligand and targeting system for delivering chemotherapeutic agents to cancer cells. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the inhibitory effects of Nar and ketoprofen-RGD on leukemia and ovarian cancer cells (K562 and SKOV3) were explored for the first time, focusing on their proliferation activity and their anti-inflammatory capacity. METHODS: Analyses were conducted on the calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) activation by ketoprofen-RGD, Nar, and their combination. These drugs' effects on protein kinase A (PKA) activation, intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level, and PDE1 inhibition were identified. Later, it was also evaluated if ketoprofen-RGD alone or in combination with Nar had anti-inflammatory effects. RESULTS: Nar improved the antagonizing consequences of ketoprofen-RGD on the CaM protein, which hinders PDE1, improving PKA activity and cAMP levels. A mixture of ketoprofen-RGD and Nar and ketoprofen-RGD alone diminished K562 and SKOV3 cell viability through the cAMP/PKA pathway by inhibiting PDE1 and CaM. These two compounds showed anti-inflammatory effects on both cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated for the first time that combining ketoprofen-RGD and Nar can be a promising anti-inflammatory therapeutic regimen for treating leukemia and ovarian cancer."

This study uses multi-omics data to elucidate the underlying mechanism of naringenin's reported benefit in alleviating (NASH). Male mice were fed a NASH-inducing (methionine-choline-deficient) MCD diet with or without naringenin supplementation for 6 weeks. Naringenin prevented NASH-induced histopathological liver damage and reversed the abnormal levels of hepatic triglyceride (TG)/total cholesterol (TC), serum TG/TC, serum alanine aminotransferase/aspartate transaminase, and hepatic malondialdehyde and glutathione. Importantly, naringenin intervention significantly modulated the relative abundance of gut microbiota and the host metabolomic profile. We detected more than 700 metabolites in the serum and found that the gut genus levels of Anaeroplasma and the [Eubacterium] nodatum group were closely associated with xanthine, 2-picoline, and securinine, respectively. Tuzzerella alterations showed the highest number of associations with host endogenous metabolites such as FAHFA (8:0/10:0), FFA (20:2), carnitine C8:1, tridecanedioic acid, securinine, acetylvaline, DL-O-tyrosine, and Phe-Asn. This study indicates that the interplay between host serum metabolites and gut microbiota may contribute to the therapeutic effect of naringenin against NASH."

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that elevated intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Increased intracellular levels of ROS can lead to the oxidation of lipids, DNA, and proteins, contributing to cellular damage. Hence, the maintenance of redox hemostasis is essential. Naringenin (NAR) is a flavonoid included in the flavanones subcategory. Various pharmacological actions have been ascribable to this phytochemical composition, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, antiadipogenic, neuro-, and cardio-protective activities. This review focused on the underlying mechanism responsible for the antioxidative stress properties of NAR and its' nanoformulations. Several lines of in vitro and in vivo investigations suggest the effects of NAR and its nanoformulation on their target cells via modulating signaling pathways. These nanoformulations include nanoemulsion, nanocarriers, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanomicelle. This review also highlights several beneficial health effects of NAR nanoformulations on human diseases including brain disorders, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and small intestine injuries. Employing nanoformulation can improve the pharmacokinetic properties of NAR and consequently efficiency by reducing its limitations, such as low bioavailability. The protective effects of NAR and its' nanoformulations against oxidative stress may be linked to the modulation of Nrf2-heme oxygenase-1, NO/cGMP/potassium channel, COX-2, NF-κB, AMPK/SIRT3, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, BDNF, NOX, and LOX-1 pathways. Understanding the mechanism behind the protective effects of NAR can facilitate drug development for the treatment of oxidative stress-related disorders."

      "abstract": "Efficient brain drug delivery has been a challenge in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and other brain disorders as blood-brain barrier (BBB) impedes most drugs to reach brain. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a novel TGN decorated erythrocyte membrane-coated poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticle (TRNNs). The nanoparticle significantly boosted the penetration (7.3 times) in a U-118MG and HCMEC/D3 cell co-culture BBB model in vitro. Living image was performed to assess the TRNNs distribution in vivo. The fluorescence intensity in the isolated brain of TRDNs-treated mice was about 8 times that of the DNs-treated. In the novel object recognition test, the mice after administration of TRDNs showed higher recognition index (0.414 ± 0.016) than the model group (0.275 ± 0.019). A significant increase in the number of dendritic spines from TRNNs administrated mice hippocampi neurons was observed after Golgi stain. This improvement of neurons was also confirmed by the significant high expression of PSD95 protein level in hippocampi. We measured the OD values of Aβ25-35 induced PC12 cells that pre-treatment with different nanoparticles and concluded that TRNNs had a robust neuroprotection effect. Above all, functional biomimetic nanoparticles could increase the accumulation of naringenin into brain, thereby enable the drug to exert greater therapeutic effects.",

The current study continues to focus on the mechanism behind CS-NPs/NAR-induced breast cancer cell (MDA-MB-231) death. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with higher concentrations (100, 200, and 200 µg) of Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs), naringenin (NAR), and chitosan-encapsulated naringenin (CS-NPs/NAR). The cell viability, proliferation, and oxidative stress parameters, such as nitric oxide [NO], xanthine oxidase (XOD), and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) levels, were analyzed. ROS levels were determined through DCFDA analysis. MTT-based cell cytotoxicity and BrdU cell proliferation analysis depicted the cytotoxicity effects (37% and 29% for 24 and 48 h) and exhibited a reduction in the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 by CS-NPs/NAR. A significant increase in NO content, XOD, a decrease in XDH, and an increase in ROS levels were observed upon treatment with CS-NPs/NAR. Fluorescent images suggested the increase in the ROS level upon treatment with CS-NPs/NAR in cancer cells, and the results suggested that it could induce apoptosis. Further, to confirm this, the activity of caspase-3 was analyzed through western blotting, and the result suggested that the higher concentration of CS-NPs/NAR has increased the activation of procaspase3 when compared to free NAR. Hence, the current investigation concludes that high doses of CS-NPs/NAR induce and increase oxidative stress and so increased activation of procaspase3 may lead to cancer cell apoptosis and reduction in cell proliferation.",

      "abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has been prevalent for nearly forty years since it was first reported. It has been one of the major diseases jeopardizing the healthy development of the world swine industry, as well as causing great economic losses to the industry's economic development. Furthermore, no way has been found to combat the disease due to the immunosuppressive properties of its pathogen porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection. We previously examined the mRNA expression of IFN-I in PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells at different time periods using qRT-PCR, and found that the mRNA expression of IFN-I in the late stage of PRRSV infection showed suppression. Naringenin is a flavonoid found in citrus fruits and has a very wide range of pharmacological activities. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the modulatory effect of naringenin on the suppressed innate immune response after PRRSV infection. The expression of IFN-I, IL-10, and ISGs in the late stage of PRRSV infection was examined using qRT-PCR, and the results showed that naringenin improved the expression of antiviral cytokines suppressed by PRRSV infection. Further results showed that naringenin treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of proteins related to the RIG-I-MAV immune signaling pathway, and that naringenin could not significantly activate the RIG-I-MAVS signaling pathway after the addition of the RIG-I inhibitor Cyclo. Overall, these data demonstrated that naringenin could improve the innate immune response suppressed by PRRSV infection by modulating the RIG-I-MAVS signaling pathway. Therefore, our study will provide a theoretical basis for the development of naringenin as a drug against immunosuppressive viral infectious disease infections.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phenolic modulators have attracted attention for their potential in shaping functional traits in plants. This work investigated the impact of naringenin (Nar) and rosmarinic acid (RA) on the functional properties of Lepidium sativum leaves and roots. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomics identified a diverse phenolic profile, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, low molecular weight phenolics, lignans, and stilbenes. Cluster, analysis of variance multiblock orthogonal partial least squares (AMOPLS), and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) multivariate analyses confirmed tissue-specific modulation of bioactive compounds. The tissue was the hierarchically most influential factor, explaining 27% of observed variability, while the treatment and their interaction were statistically insignificant. Thereafter, various in vitro assays were employed to assess antioxidant capacity, including 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activity, cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), metal chelating ability, and phosphomolybdenum (PMD) assays. Extracts were also tested for inhibitory effects on cholinesterase, amylase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase enzymes. RA application positively impacted antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities, holding valuable implications in shaping the health-promoting properties of L. sativum. CONCLUSION: The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed a significant tissue-dependent modulation of bioactive compounds, determining no synergistic effect between applying phenolic compounds in combination. Specifically, the sole application of RA increased anthocyanins and hydroxyphenyl propanoic acid content on leaves, which was strictly related to enhancing the biological activities. © 2023 The Authors.

The system was characterized based on particle size, PDI, zeta potential, surface morphology (SEM, AFM, and TEM), solid-state and chemical properties (XRD, IR, and NMR), aerodynamic parameters, drug loading, entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release study. The optimized NRG SLN DOX sMS exhibited particle size, zeta potential, and PDI of 2.1 µm, 31.2 mV, and 0.310, respectively; a drug entrapment efficiency > 79 %; a drug loading efficiency > 13 %; cumulative drug releases of about 78 % for DOX and 72 % for NRG after 6 and 12 h, respectively; good swelling and desirable aerodynamic properties. In addition, in vivo studies conducted in mice, a murine model of asthma showed significant reductions in serum bicarbonate and eosinophil counts and improvement in respiratory flow rate, tidal volume, and bronchial wall lining compared with the asthmatic control group.

Increasing evidence indicates that it has several properties of biological significance, such as anti-infection, sterilization, anti-allergy, antioxidant free radical, and anti-tumor. However, its effect on osteoarthritis has not been elucidated properly. In this study, the treatment of primary chondrocytes with interleukin (IL)-1β was found to increase the secretions of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Further, the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase ((MMP)3, MMP9, and MMP13), the protein expression of Recombinant A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase With Thrombospondin 5 (ADAMTS5), and cell apoptosis increased; the protein expression of Collagen II decreased. The injury of primary chondrocytes induced by IL-1β was reversed under the intervention of naringenin; this reversal was dose-dependent. The mechanistic study showed that naringenin inhibited the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)/NF-κB pathway in IL-1β-stimulated primary cells, and LPS, a TLR4 activator, reversed this inhibitory effect. In addition, a mouse model of osteoarthritis was established and treated with naringenin. The results revealed that naringenin alleviated the pathological symptoms of osteoarthritis in mice, reduced the expression of TLR4 and TRAF6, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB in knee cartilage tissue. It also inhibited the secretion of inflammatory factors, reduced extracellular matrix degradation, and decreased the protein expression of cleaved caspase3. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that naringenin may be a potential option for the treatment of osteoarthritis.",

However, its specific implications for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and pharmacological mechanism of Naringenin in the treatment of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). METHODS: A CIA model was established in DBA/1 mice, and various doses of Naringenin were administered orally to assess its impact on RA. The study also involved lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells to further evaluate the effects of Naringenin. Mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the signaling pathways involved in Naringenin's actions. RESULTS: Naringenin significantly alleviated foot inflammation in DBA/1 CIA mice and attenuated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. It also enhanced antioxidant capacity in the CIA model. In vitro studies with LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells demonstrated that Naringenin attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Mechanistic studies confirmed that Naringenin activated autophagy and increased autophagic flux. Blocking autophagy, either by silencing Atg5 or inhibiting autophagolysosome using chloroquine, effectively counteracted the impact of Naringenin on pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further exploration revealed that Naringenin activated the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway, and inhibition of AMPK reversed the initiation of autophagy and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion induced by Naringenin. CONCLUSIONS: This study unveils a novel mechanism by which Naringenin may be used to treat RA. It demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of Naringenin in a CIA model by reducing inflammation, modulating cytokine levels, and enhancing antioxidant capacity. Moreover, the activation of autophagy through the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway appears to play a critical role in Naringenin's anti-inflammatory effects. These findings suggest potential strategies for the development of anti-rheumatic medications based on Naringenin.",

      "abstract": "Naringenin is a citrus flavonoid that potently improves metabolic parameters in animal models of metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes. Estrogen receptor (ER) activation promotes β cell function and survival, thereby improving systemic glucose metabolism. In this study, we used a luciferase reporter assay, isolated rat islets and a diabetic rat model to investigate the effects of naringenin on ER signaling and the underlying mechanism of naringenin-mediated improvement of islet function in diabetes. Naringenin specifically activated ERβ without affecting the activity of ERα, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) or estrogen-related receptor (ERR) α/β/γ. Additionally, treatment with naringenin enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated rat islets. This effect was abrogated by PHTPP, an ERβ antagonist. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that naringenin upregulated the expression of genes, such as Pdx1 and Mafa, which are closely linked to improved β-cell function. In consistence, single administration of naringenin to normal rats elevated plasma insulin levels and improved glucose responses. These beneficial effects were blocked by PHTPP. In streptozocin-nicotinamide induced diabetic rats, treatment for 2 weeks with naringenin alone, but not in combination with PHTPP, significantly restored pancreatic β cell mass and improved glucose metabolism. Collectively, these data support that naringenin specifically activate ERβ to improve insulin secretion in the primary rat islets. Furthermore, naringenin administration also protected β cell function and reversed glucose dysregulation in diabetic rats. These beneficial effects are at least partially dependent on the ERβ pathway.",

The traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology database and analysis platform Database, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine Database were then used to predict the related targets of NR. Online mendelian inheritance in man, Disgenet, Gene cards, The therapeutic target database and Drug bank were used to screen NAFLD targets, and the intersection analysis was performed with the targets of NR active components to obtain the targets of NR in the treatment of NAFLD. The protein-protein interaction network of therapeutic targets was constructed by protein-protein interaction networks functional enrichment analysis 11.0, and gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment analysis of therapeutic targets was performed by Metascape platform. RESULTS: In this study, 171 NR targets and 1748 potential targets of NAFLD were screened, and 89 crossover targets and 16 core targets were screened and finally obtained. A total of 176 GO items were obtained by GO enrichment analysis (P < .05), including 389 biological process, 6 cell composition and 30 molecular function. A total of 137 signaling pathways were obtained by Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment and screening (P < .05). The core targets of NR in the treatment of NAFLD are TP53, CASP3, PRKCA, AKT1, RELA, PPARG, NCOA2, CYP1A1, ESR1, MAPK3, STAT3, JAK1, MAPK1, TNF, PPARA and PRKCB. Enrichment analysis showed that NR mainly involved in biological processes such as cellular response to nitrogen compound, regulation of miRNA transcription and negative regulation of miRNA-mediated gene silencing. It regulates Hepatitis B, Lipid and atherosclerosis, cytomegalovirus infection, Hepatitis C, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic patients complications and other ways play a role in the treatment of NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of NR on NAFLD has the characteristics of multi-targets and multi-pathways, which provides a preliminary theoretical basis for clinical trials and the development of new drugs.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease. Naringenin (Nar) possesses an anti-inflammatory property. This paper attempts to discuss the functional mechanism of Nar in AD mice through the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. METHODS: Mouse models of DNFB-induced AD were established and treated with Nar, followed by intraperitoneal injection with the JAK2/STAT3 pathway activator Coumermycin A1. Dermatitis severity was scored and the thickness of right ear was measured. The pathological changes in dorsal skin tissues were observed by HE staining. The number of infiltrated mast cells and eosinophilic granulocytes was counted by TB staining. The serum IgE level and levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-12, and IL-5 in dorsal skin tissues were measured by ELISA. The levels of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, and STAT3 were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Nar decreased dermatitis scores and right ear thickness, alleviated skin lesions, and reduced the number of infiltrated mast cells and eosinophilic granulocytes in AD mice. The serum IgE level and levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-12, and IL-5 in dorsal skin tissues of AD mice were diminished after Nar treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Nar inhibited the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. The activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway partially nullified the therapeutic function of Nar on AD mice. CONCLUSION: Nar protects mice from AD by inhibiting inflammation and promoting immune responses through the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and other age-related neurodegenerative ailments have a strong link to oxidative stress. Bioflavonoid naringenin has antioxidant properties. The effects of pre- and post-naringenin supplementation on a rotenone-induced PD model were examined in this work. Naringenin (50 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered to rats for two weeks before the administration of rotenone in the pre-treatment phase. In contrast, rotenone (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered for eight days before naringenin (50 mg/kg, p.o.) was supplemented for two weeks in the post-treatment phase. During behavioral investigation, the motor and non-motor signs of PD were observed. Additionally, estimation of neurochemical and biochemical parameters was also carried out. Compared to controls, rotenone treatment substantially increased oxidative stress, altered neurotransmitters, and caused motor and non-motor impairments. Rotenone-induced motor and non-motor impairments were considerably reduced by naringenin supplementation. The supplementation also increased antioxidant enzyme activities and restored the changes in neurotransmitter levels. The findings of this work strongly imply that daily consumption of flavonoids such as naringenin may have a therapeutic potential to combat PD.",

      "abstract": "The impact of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the biosynthetic manipulation of Priestia megaterium metabolism where an existing gene cluster is enhanced to produce and enrich bioactive secondary metabolites has been studied previously. In this research, we aimed to isolate and elucidate the structure of metabolites of compounds 1 and 2 which have been analyzed previously in P. megaterium crude extract. This was achieved through a PREP-ODS C18 column with an HPLC-UV/visible detector. Then, the compounds were subjected to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. Furthermore, bioinformatics and transcriptome analysis were used to examine the gene expression for which the secondary metabolites produced in the presence of AuNPs showed significant enhancement in transcriptomic responses. The metabolites of compounds 1 and 2 were identified as daidzein and genistein, respectively. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to assess the expression of three genes (csoR, CHS, and yjiB) from a panel of selected genes known to be involved in the biosynthesis of the identified secondary metabolites. The expression levels of two genes (csoR and yijB) increased in response to AuNP intervention, whereas CHS was unaffected."

      "abstract": "According to epidemiological research, as the population ages, neurological illnesses are becoming a bigger issue. Despite improvements in the treatment of these diseases, there are still widespread worries about how to find a long-lasting remedy. Several neurological diseases can be successfully treated with natural substances. As a result, current research has been concentrated on finding effective neuroprotective drugs with improved efficacy and fewer side effects. Naringenin is one potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. Many citrus fruits, tomatoes, bergamots, and other fruits are rich in naringenin, a flavonoid. This phytochemical is linked to a variety of biological functions. Naringenin has attracted a lot of interest for its ability to exhibit neuroprotection through several mechanisms. In the current article, we present evidence from the literature that naringenin reduces neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in brain tissues. Also, the literatures that are currently accessible shows that naringenin reduces neuroinflammation and other neurological anomalies. Additionally, we found several studies that touted naringenin as a promising anti-amyloidogenic, antidepressant, and neurotrophic treatment option. This review's major goal is to reflect on advancements in knowledge of the molecular processes that underlie naringenin's possible neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, this article also provides highlights of Naringenin with respect to its chemistry and pharmacokinetics.",

      "abstract": "Dasatinib (DASA) is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor, approved for leukemia treatment. However, the long-term use of DASA induces several complications, especially liver damage. On the other hand, Naringenin (NGN) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent which is known to exert protective effects in several liver disease animal models. Yet, the effect of NGN on DASA-induced hepatotoxicity has not been examined. This study investigated the hepatoprotective effects of NGN against DASA-induced acute liver injury, using a mouse model. The mice were given NGN (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg po) or saline for 7 days, followed by DASA on the eighth day (25 mg/kg p.o.). DASA treatment alone was found to cause overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and malonyl aldehyde (MDA), whereas attenuation of antioxidant genes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Interestingly, a pretreatment with NGN + DASA resulted in minimizing the proinflammatory mediators and restoring the levels of antioxidant genes. In addition, there was evidence of necro-inflammatory changes in histopathological findings in the liver samples after DASA administration which remarkably reduced with NGN + DASA. Thus, this study revealed that NGN could minimize the hepatotoxicity induced by DASA by providing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant protection."
