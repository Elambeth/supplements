      "abstract": "Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is commonly used for its analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects worldwide. However ibuprofen comes with serious unavoidable adverse effects on various organs when used for long duration or overdosed. Trichopus zeylanicus is a medicinal plant endemic to India owning various beneficial properties and is been used in treating various ailments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the ameliorative effect of aqueous leaves' extract of Trichopus zeylanicus against ibuprofen-induced hepatic toxicity and enteropathy in rats. Overall in this study 30 male albino rats were used, which were divided into five groups (six in each group). Group-I was normal control, Group-II was ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day) inebriated group, Group-III  was silymarin (25 mg/kg/day) pretreated  + ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day), Group-IV was  ALETZ (1000 mg/kg/day) pretreated + ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day), and Group-V was ALETZ alone (1000 mg/kg/day) group. The duration of the administration was for five days, followed by scarifying rats on the sixth day. Later the rats were assessed for liver and intestine enzyme markers, antioxidant parameters along with histopathological changes. In addition the pro-inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels were measured using ELISA. Lastly the expression pattern of apoptotic signaling markers such as caspase-3, caspase-8 and Bcl-2 was evaluated using western blot. The results obtained from this study showed changes in levels of aforesaid parameter which presented the toxic effect of ibuprofen on liver and small intestine. Pre-treatment of ALETZ in ibuprofen-inebriated group was able to normalize the adverse effect caused due to ibuprofen. The conclusion of the study deduces that pre-treatment with ALETZ alleviates by modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in ibuprofen inebriated rats, indicating its protective mechanism.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue is a complex and little understood symptom for which there is no safe and effective pharmacotherapy. The present study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of Trichopus zeylanicus whole plant powder on fatigue in young Sprague Dawley rats, and aged normal and long-living mutant Ames dwarf mice. Fatigue was evaluated by subjecting the animals to a forced swim test. Trichopus zeylanicus (250 and 500 mg/kg) treated young Sprague-Dawley rats resisted fatigue at a significant level (p < 0.005) compared with controls by an extended swim time in the forced swim test. Oral Trichopus zeylanicus (500 mg/kg) treatment for 2 weeks significantly increased the mobility time in the aged mutant (p < 0.05) and normal mice (p < 0.01) and significantly increased the swim time in the forced swim test in the aged normal mice (p < 0.05). Amphetamine-mimetic activity in Trichopus zeylanicus was excluded by suitable tests. These results show that Trichopus zeylanicus whole plant powder has anti-fatigue effects in young Sprague-Dawley rats and aged normal and mutant Ames dwarf mice providing scientific evidence for the Kani tribal practice in India.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue is considered a complex symptom for which currently there is no curative treatment available. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the etiology of fatigue and antioxidant treatment might be a valuable therapeutic approach. The Kani, a tribal high altitude living population in southern India, traditionally use the seeds of Trichopus zeylanicus to combat fatigue. In this study, the antioxidant properties of Trichopus zeylanicus were established on free radicals (DPPH and ABTS), its ability to reduce iron, lipoxygenase activity and hydrogen peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation. The effects of Trichopus zeylanicus on reactive oxygen species induced plasmid DNA (pBR322) cleavage were also investigated. Trichopus zeylanicus significantly scavenged free radicals, reduced lipid peroxidation and inhibited lipoxygenase activity. Trichopus zeylanicus also exhibited iron-chelating activity and inhibited reactive oxygen species induced DNA damage. Trichopus zeylanicus contains NADH, polyphenols and sulfhydryl compounds, which have the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species suggesting that the antioxidant activity may be an important mechanism of action of Trichopus zeylanicus to combat fatigue.",

Further, it reduced the ratio of mast cells in the peritoneal exudate cells. The plant drug treatment did not protect mice from E. coli-induced abdominal sepsis. Studies in rats using mesenteric mast cells confirmed the above mast cell-stabilizing property of T. zeylanicus. This activity was found in the butanol fraction of methanol extract of T. zeylanicus leaf. The treatment with this fraction also reduced the number of rat mesenteric mast cells. However, the in vitro treatment of the mast cells with the butanol fraction did not inhibit antigen-induced degranulation of the mast cells.",

This activity of the ethanol extract was concentration dependent and destroyed by heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Although oral administration of a single dose (200 mg/kg) was effective, daily administration of the extract for 6 days was found to be more effective. The pups fathered by the drug treated mice were found to be normal with reference to foetal growth, litter size and sex ratio. The water as well as n-hexane extracts of the plant leaf were inactive.

This increase in the proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages could be one of the mechanism of T.zeylanicus induced immunomodulation. Treatment with T. zeylanicus protected mice from tumour cell growth when challenged with 0.5 million of EAC ascetic tumour cells / mouse. Studies on the gastrointestinal function of this drug showed that the drug slightly reduced intestinal motility as judged from charcoal movement."
