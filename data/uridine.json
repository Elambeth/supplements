      "abstract": "Dysfunction of mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation and aberrant respiratory chain components are common in cardiac defects. However, the precise role of mitochondrial respiration in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is unclear. Phenylephrine (PE) treatment on rat neonatal H9c2 cardiomyocytes promotes significant hypertrophy with decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), membrane potential, respiratory subunits NDUFB8, UQCRC2, and ATP5a expressions and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Surprisingly, 60% reductions in cell survivability were observed in PE-treated cells compared to control cells grown under the respiratory-proficient galactose media. To revert H9c2 hypertrophy and survivability, we performed a screening with compounds that boost mitochondrial OCR and scavenge ROS, and identified pyruvate plus uridine as the best hit. Corroborated with the in vitro study, supplementation of pyruvate plus uridine significantly prevents PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy, pericardial edema, and bradycardia symptoms in zebrafish embryos. Moreover, pyruvate plus uridine decreases the ventricular and atrial area in cardiomyocyte-specific GFP transgenic Tg (myl7:HRAS-EGFP) lines. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we showed that boosting of mitochondrial respiration by pyruvate and scavenging ROS by uridine supplementations conjointly ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy and bradycardia symptoms."

      "abstract": "AIMS: To evaluate the analgesic and neuroprotective effects of cytidine, uridine, and gabapentin-administered alone and in combination-in models of diabetic neuropathy and formalin-induced acute and inflammatory pain. MATERIALS & METHODS: Oral doses of cytidine, uridine, and gabapentin (100 mg/kg each) were administered to rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy and in a formalin test model. Behavioral responses were recorded at 30, 60, and 120 minutes following treatment after five weeks of diabetes induction. Spinal cord p-CREB expression was measured to assess molecular changes, and pretreatments with naloxone, yohimbine, and methysergide were employed to explore opioid, adrenergic, and serotonergic contributions. RESULTS: All treatments significantly reduced formalin-induced pain in both acute and inflammatory phases (p < 0.05; p < 0.001) and increased mechanical pain thresholds in the diabetic neuropathy model at all-time points (p < 0.05). Combination therapy proved more effective than gabapentin alone (p < 0.05) and was associated with decreased spinal p-CREB levels, indicating altered anti-nociceptive signaling. CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of cytidine, uridine, and gabapentin enhances analgesia and neuroprotection compared to monotherapy, supporting its potential as a novel, analgesic-free treatment strategy for diabetic neuropathy."

      "abstract": "Nucleotides are essential for nucleic acid synthesis, signaling, and metabolism, and can be synthesized de novo or through salvage. Rapidly proliferating cells require large amounts of nucleotides, making nucleotide metabolism a widely exploited target for cancer therapy. However, resistance frequently emerges, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of nucleotide regulation. Here, we harness uridine salvage and CRISPR-Cas9 screening to reveal regulators of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. We identify several factors and report that pyrimidine synthesis can continue in the absence of coenzyme Q (CoQ), the canonical electron acceptor in de novo synthesis. We further investigate NUDT5 and report its conserved interaction with PPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in purine synthesis. We show that in the absence of NUDT5, hyperactive purine synthesis siphons the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pool at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis, promoting resistance to chemotherapy. Intriguingly, the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT appears to be disrupted by PRPP, highlighting intricate allosteric regulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism for maintaining nucleotide balance and position NUDT5 as a potential biomarker for predicting resistance to chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early-onset severe toxicity following the administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine occurs in approximately 10-30% of patients receiving fluoropyrimidine therapy in the USA and is fatal to at least 0.5% of patients treated. Supportive care measures used to manage symptoms of toxicity are associated with extended hospital length of stay, high cost of care, and poor survival. Uridine triacetate is indicated as an emergency treatment for patients who exhibit early-onset, severe or life-threatening toxicity, and has been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes. Despite its life-saving capability to reverse early-onset severe toxicity, uridine triacetate may be underutilized. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the economic impact of uridine triacetate as a rescue therapy for adult patients from the US hospital payer perspective for early-onset severe toxicity, who are expected to die without treatment. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to compare inpatient survival, hospital length of stay, and inpatient healthcare resource utilization for patients treated with and without uridine triacetate. Costs associated with hospitalization, including supportive care measures and monitoring were evaluated, considering medications and procedures commonly used to manage various severe toxicities experienced (e.g., gastrointestinal, hematological, etc.). The model compared the hypothetical current practice, in which approximately half of patients expected to die from early-onset severe toxicity receive uridine triacetate in addition to supportive care, with the proposed future practice in which all eligible patients receive uridine triacetate during their hospital stay. Hypothetical practical scenarios for US institutions were also considered. RESULTS: For each adult patient hospitalized for early-onset severe or life-threatening toxicity who would be expected to die without treatment, adoption of uridine triacetate as a rescue treatment was associated with clinical benefits, including increased inpatient survival (48.5%) and a 7.3-day reduction in total hospital length of stay per patient. Treatment of each additional patient with uridine triacetate was associated with an incremental cost of US$25,247 per patient. Seventy percent of the drug cost was offset by reduction in inpatient healthcare resources utilization. This cost offset is likely underestimated as it does not include additional savings from potential reimbursements associated with changes in hospital length of stay, readmissions and discounting. Hypothetical scenarios demonstrated that model outputs were most sensitive to changes in length of stay and hospitalization costs. CONCLUSION: Optimal treatment with uridine triacetate for all hospitalized patients in the USA expected to die from early-onset severe toxicity has the potential to improve inpatient survival at a minimal inpatient budget increase. The majority of the drug cost is offset by a reduction in the length of hospital stay and associated costs.",

      "abstract": "The specific pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) is complex and not yet clear, and the clinical treatment methods are relatively limited. It is of great clinical significance to explore its pathogenesis and effective molecular targets. Here, we identified an ALI biomarker (UPP1) associated with uridine metabolism by a systematic bioinformatics approach. It was also confirmed to be associated with the glycolytic pathway in the mouse ALI model. In addition, drug sensitivity analysis based on the CMAP database identified three UPP1-associated drugs (CAY10585, XL147 and IOX2) that may be useful in the treatment of ALI. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed the stability of the binding between UPP1 and the three drugs. In conclusion, this study confirms that the uridine metabolism gene UPP1 associated with glycolysis is a key biomarker of ALI and provides valuable insights into the potential application of CAY10585, XL147 and IOX2 in ALI."

      "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is the second most important parasitic disease worldwide. Schistosomiasis japonica is a unique species endemic to southern China, and schistosomiasis is characterized by severe liver injury, inflammation, liver granuloma, and subsequent liver fibrosis. However, the pathological mechanism of this disease remains unclear. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a versatile technique that integrates the molecular specificity of mass spectrometry (MS) with spatial imaging information, which could provide an accurate method for observing disease progression. In this study, we used an air flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization (AFADESI-MSI) platform to detect a wide range of metabolites and visualize their distribution in the liver tissue of mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum. In the negative ion mode analysis, 21 and 25 different metabolites were detected in the early and chronic stages of infection, respectively. Thirteen characteristic metabolites and 3 metabolic pathways related to disease development may be involved in the chronicity of schistosomiasis. There were more than 32 and 40 region-specific changes in the abundance of a wide range of metabolites (including carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids) in the livers of mice at two different infection times, which also revealed the heterogeneous metabolic characteristics of the liver egg granulomas of S. japonicum. In a chronic infection model with S. japonicum, oral treatment with praziquantel significantly alleviated most metabolic disorders, including fatty acid and pyrimidine metabolism. Surprisingly, Upase1, a key enzyme in uridine metabolism, was significantly upregulated 6 weeks after infection, and liver uridine levels were negatively correlated with the abundance of multiple lipid-associated metabolites. Further studies revealed that in vitro uridine supplementation inhibited the activation of LX-2 cells, restored the homeostasis of fatty acid metabolism through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) pathway, and played an antifibrotic role. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of S. japonicum-induced liver fibrosis and the potential of targeting uridine metabolism in disease therapy.",

Adverse events (AEs) of DTG treatment, including headache, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and abnormal dreams, are influenced by sex, body weight, age, and serum bilirubin levels. DTG is mainly metabolised by members of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A subfamilies (UGT1As), especially UGT1A1.Some studies suggest a relationship between UGT1A1 variants and AEs. The aim of this study was to identify UGT1A isoforms that exhibit DTG glucuronidation activity and determine the relationship between UGT1A variants and DTG glucuronidation in vitro.UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10 exhibited DTG glucuronidation activity, of which UGT1A1 was the most active. Furthermore, variants of these isoforms showed decreased DTG glucuronidation activity. The different variants of UGT1As, such as UGT1A1.6, UGT1A1.7, UGT1A1.35, UGT1A1.63, UGT1A3.5, UGT1A9.2, UGT1A10M59I, and UGT1A10T202I, showed reduced glucuronidation activity towards DTG in comparison with the wild-type UGT1As.This study elucidates the relationship between UGT1A variants and the levels of glucuronidation associated with each variant.Checking for UGT1As may be helpful in predicting potential toxicities and adverse effects related to DTG treatment."

RNA stability varies in individual transcripts and is modulated by trans-acting factors such as microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and RNA-binding proteins, which determine protein output and subsequent cellular processes. To measure RNA decay rate, accurate and reliable methodologies are essential in the field of RNA biology. Transcription inhibition and metabolic labeling enable comprehensive investigations on RNA decay, offering critical insights into dynamic regulation of RNA decay. Transcription shut-off has been employed widely by using various approaches, such as treatment with chemical inhibitors or generation of temperature-sensitive mutants of RNA polymerases. However, it has limitations, providing a static view and lacking real-time dynamics as well as precise measurement of decay rate. Metabolic labeling, a method of incorporating modified nucleotides into RNA transcripts, complements shut-off approaches, allowing selective monitoring of newly synthesized RNA and tracing decay intermediates. The purpose of the protocol described in this chapter is to assess the kinetics and statics of newly synthesized RNA and its decay by 5-ethynyl uridine labeling.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the possible mediation of epigenetic mechanisms underlying the regenerative effect of uridine in a sciatic nerve transection rat model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty adult male rats were randomized to sham, control, and uridine groups. After unilateral transection and primary anastomosis of the right sciatic nerve, a single daily dose of saline (1 ml/kg; sham and control groups) or uridine (500 mg/kg; uridine group) was injected intraperitoneally for a week. The sciatic nerves were removed en bloc on the eighth day and levels of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), acetylated histone-H3, and acetylated histone-H4 were analyzed in nerve homogenates. The number of myelinated axons in the sciatic nerve specimens was analyzed histomorphologically. RESULTS: The HDAC1 levels were significantly greater in the control group than in the sham (p < 0.001) and uridine (p < 0.01) groups. Compared to the sham group, the acetylated histone-H3 and histone-H4 levels decreased in the control group (by 81.49% and 79.98%, respectively for both; p < 0.001) and increased significantly in the uridine group (by 62.54% and 51.68% respectively; p < 0.01, p < 0.05). The number of myelinated axons decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the control group, which was enhanced significantly by uridine administration. CONCLUSION: Epigenetic mechanisms may partly mediate the regenerative effect of uridine treatment in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. Our data provides novel insights in the management of peripheral nerve damage and suggests potential benefit of uridine for degenerative diseases in which epigenetic impairments are involved.",

      "abstract": "In 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved uridine triacetate to treat overdose and severe toxicity of the fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy agents 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its oral prodrug capecitabine. Uridine triacetate is as an oral prodrug of uridine that competes with cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine metabolites for incorporation into nucleotides. Two million people worldwide start fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy each year, with 20-30% developing severe or life-threatening adverse effects, often attributable to a genetic predisposition such as dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. Whilst genetic prescreening is recommended prior to starting fluoropyrimidine agents, this only prevents 20-30% of early-onset life-threatening toxicity and so does not obviate the need for an antidote. Initial in-human studies established that uridine triacetate more than doubles the maximum tolerated weekly 5-FU bolus dose. A lack of clinical equipoise meant a placebo-controlled phase III trial was not ethical and so the phase III trials used historical controls. These found that uridine triacetate improved survival in those with fluoropyrimidine overdose and severe toxicity from 16% to 94%, with 34% able to resume chemotherapy within 30 days. Five case reports of delayed fluoropyrimidine toxicity demonstrate improvement following uridine triacetate treatment 120-504 h after last fluoropyrimidine administration, suggesting efficacy beyond the FDA licencing indications. Mechanistically uridine triacetate would be expected to be effective for overdose and severe toxicity of tegafur (a 5-FU prodrug), but there are no published case reports describing this. Uridine triacetate is available internationally through an expanded access scheme and has been available in the UK since 2019 on a named patient basis.",

Evidence suggests there are four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4), of which DENV 2 is considered to cause the most sever dengue. Therefore, this study was aimed to develop the new uridine derivatives (NUDs) against dengue virus (DENV 2). In current study 2-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-4-((substituted cyclohexa-2,5-dienylidene)methyl)-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione (2a-f), were obtained via reaction of substituted uridine (1) and different aromatic aldehydes separately. Synthesized NUDs were further characterized using FTIR, 1H & 13C-NMR, mass and element analysis data. Characterized NUDs were assessed for their inhibition potential against DENV 2. Synthesized NUDs were also evaluated for their cytotoxicity towards Vero cells by MTT assay method. This investigation successfully synthesized NUDs 2a-f and reported their high inhibitory activity against DENV 2. The synthesized NUDs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity. High anti-viral activity against DENV 2 serotype and least/no cytotoxicity of NUDs suggests their importance in the treatment of dengue. Present study recommends that in future these NUDs must be investigated for their clinical importance to establish them as a choice for dengue treatment.",

Secondly, this study aimed to establish the effect of uridine on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters that contribute to ER stress. METHODS: Status epilepticus was induced using lithium-pilocarpine in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Following SE termination, rats were treated with uridine, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), or saline twice daily for 48 h. Expressions of hippocampal glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), Inositol- Requiring Protein 1 (IRE1α), Protein kinase RNA-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK), and C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP) were determined by western blotting 48 h after SE. Uridine's effects on apoptosis, inflammation or oxidation were evaluated by analyses of cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) protein expressions or pro-inflammatory cytokine levels or levels of oxidative stress markers, respectively. RESULTS: Expressions of all ER stress-related proteins significantly increased 48 h after SE. Uridine treatment markedly decreased GRP78, IRE1α, and CHOP levels. A decrease in the PERK level was observed following the administration of 4-PBA; however, uridine had no effect. Cleaved caspase-3 and PARP1 levels were increased in the SHAM group, while uridine and 4-PBA treatment effectively decreased their expressions. Treatment with uridine significantly reduced Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while tending to increase Catalase (CAT) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) levels. Uridine treatment also significantly attenuated levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which increased 48 h post-SE. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that uridine alleviates ER stress after SE. This effect may be attributed to the regulation of inflammation and oxidative stress. Uridine shows promise as a potential preventive agent for epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "The uridine derivatives UDP-glucose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine are important for cell wall construction as they are the precursors for the synthesis of β-1,3-glucan and chitin, respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated attenuated virulence of uridine auxotrophs in mice, which has been attributed to insufficient uridine levels for growth in the host. We have discovered that uridine deprivation in the uridine auxotroph ura3ΔΔ disrupts cell wall architecture by increasing surface mannans, exposing β-1,3-glucan and chitin, and decreasing UDP-sugar levels. Cell wall architecture and UDP-sugars can be rescued with uridine supplementation. The cell wall architectural disruptions in the ura3ΔΔ mutant also impact immune activation since the mutant elicited greater TNFα secretion from RAW264.7 macrophages than wild type. To determine if cell wall defects contributed to decreased virulence in the ura3ΔΔ mutant, we used a murine model of systemic infection. Mice infected with the ura3ΔΔ mutant exhibited increased survival and reduced kidney fungal burden compared with mice infected with wild type. However, suppression of the immune response with cyclophosphamide did not rescue virulence in mice infected with the ura3ΔΔ mutant, indicating the attenuation in virulence of uridine auxotrophs can be attributed to decreased growth in the host but not increased exposure of β-1,3-glucan. Moreover, the ura3ΔΔ mutant is unable to grow on ex vivo kidney agar, which demonstrates its inability to colonize the kidneys due to poor growth. Thus, although uridine auxotrophy elicits changes to cell wall architecture that increase the exposure of immunogenic polymers, metabolic fitness costs more strongly drive the observed virulence attenuation.IMPORTANCECandida albicans is a common cause of bloodstream infections (candidemia). Treatment of these bloodstream infections is made difficult because of increasing antifungal resistance and drug toxicity. Thus, new tactics are needed for antifungal drug development, with immunotherapy being of particular interest. The cell wall of C. albicans is composed of highly immunogenic polymers, particularly β-1,3-glucan. However, β-1,3-glucan is naturally masked by an outer layer of mannoproteins, which hampers the detection of the fungus by the host immune system. Alteration in cell wall components has been shown to increase β-1,3-glucan exposure; however, it is unknown how the inability to synthesize precursors to cell wall components affects unmasking. Here, we demonstrate how cell wall architecture is altered in response to a deficit in precursors for cell wall synthesis and how uridine is a crucial component of these precursors.",

Although previous studies highlighted the pivotal roles of individual metabolites in hematopoiesis, comprehensive and high-resolution metabolomic profiles of different hematopoietic cells across ages are still lacking. In this study, we created a metabolome atlas of different blood cells across ages in mice. We reveal here that purine, pyrimidine and retinol metabolism are enriched in young hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), whereas glutamate and sphingolipid metabolism are concentrated in aged HSPCs. Through metabolic screening, we identified uridine as a potential regulator to rejuvenate aged HSPCs. Mechanistically, uridine treatment upregulates the FoxO signaling pathway and enhances self-renewal while suppressing inflammation in aged HSCs. Finally, we constructed an open-source platform for public easy access and metabolomic analysis in blood cells. Collectively, we provide a resource for metabolic studies in hematopoiesis that can contribute to future anti-aging metabolite screening.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) has become the leading cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. Our previous study had observed that Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) infection or its derived products could inhibit AS development by inducing an anti-inflammatory response. We performed a metabolic analysis to screen Nb-derived metabolites with anti-inflammation activity and evaluated the AS-prevention effect. We observed that the metabolite uridine had higher expression levels in mice infected with the Nb and ES (excretory-secretory) products and could be selected as a key metabolite. ES and uridine interventions could reduce the pro-inflammatory responses and increase the anti-inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. The apolipoprotein E gene knockout (ApoE-/-) mice were fed with a high-fat diet for the AS modeling. Following the in vivo intervention, ES products or uridine significantly reduced serum and liver lipid levels, alleviated the formation of atherosclerosis, and reduced the pro-inflammatory responses in serum or plaques, while the anti-inflammatory responses showed opposite trends. After blocking with 5-HD (5-hydroxydecanoate sodium) in vitro, the mRNA levels of M2 markers were significantly reduced. When blocked with 5-HD in vivo, the degree of atherosclerosis was worsened, the pro-inflammatory responses were increased compared to the uridine group, while the anti-inflammatory responses decreased accordingly. Uridine, a key metabolite from Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, showed anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in vitro and in vivo, which depend on the activation of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel.",

Studies show higher UGT1A1 levels in pancreatic cancer cells than normal cells. Therefore, we need a method to monitor the activity level of UGT1A1 in pancreatic cancer cells and in vivo. Here, we report a fluorescent probe, BCy-panc, for UGT1A1 imaging in cells and in vivo. Compared with other molecular probes, this probe is readily prepared, with high selectivity and sensitivity for the detection of UGT1A1. Our results show that BCy-panc rapidly detects UGT1A1 in pancreatic cancer. In addition, there is an urgent need for evidence to clarify the relationship between UGT1A1 and pancreatic cancer development. The present investigation found that the increase of UGT1A1 by chrysin was effective in inducing apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. These results indicate that the synergistic effect of chrysin and cisplatin at the cellular level is superior to that of cisplatin alone. The UGT1A1 level may be a biomarker for early diagnosis of cancer. Meanwhile, UGT1A1 plays a crucial role in pancreatic cancer, and the combination of chrysin and cisplatin may provide effective ideas for pancreatic cancer treatment.",

Herein, a uridine (dU)-modified Ru(II) complex (RdU) was synthesized by click chemistry. It was found that RdU exhibits impressive photo-induced inhibition against the growth of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in normoxic and hypoxic microenvironments through ROS production. It was further revealed that RdU induces ferroptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells under light irradiation (650 nm, 300 mW/cm2). Additional experiments showed that RdU binds to lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP-2), which was confirmed by the fact that RdU selectively localizes in the lysosomes of MDA-MB-231 cells and significantly augments the levels of LIMP-2. Molecular docking simulations and an isothermal titration calorimetry assay also showed that RdU has a high affinity to LIMP-2. Finally, in vivo studies in tumor-bearing (MDA-MB-231 cells) nude mice showed that RdU exerts promising photodynamic therapeutic effects on TNBC tumors. In summary, the uridine-modified Ru(II) complex has been developed as a potential LIMP-2 targeting agent for TNBC treatment through enhancing ROS production and promoting ferroptosis."

      "abstract": "Uridine is a pyrimidine nucleoside found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with a concentration higher than the other nucleosides. As a simple metabolite, uridine plays a pivotal role in various biological processes. In addition to nucleic acid synthesis, uridine is critical to glycogen synthesis through the formation of uridine diphosphate glucose in which promotes the production of UDP-GlcNAc in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and supplies UDP-GlcNAc for O-GlcNAcylation. This process can regulate protein modification and affect its function. Moreover, Uridine has an effect on body temperature and circadian rhythms, which can regulate the metabolic rate and the expression of metabolic genes. Abnormal levels of blood uridine have been found in people with diabetes and obesity, suggesting a link of uridine dysregulation and metabolic disorders. At present, the role of uridine in glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism is controversial, and the mechanism is not clear, but it shows the trend of long-term damage and short-term benefit. Therefore, maintaining uridine homeostasis is essential for maintaining basic functions and normal metabolism. This article summarizes the latest findings about the metabolic effects of uridine and the potential of uridine metabolism as therapeutic target in treatment of metabolic disorders."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-50 (DEE-50) is a rare clinical condition believed to be caused by a mutation in the CAD gene and is associated with a bleak prognosis. CAD-related diseases have a wide range of clinical manifestations and other symptoms that may be easily overlooked. Like other rare diseases, the clinical manifestations and the treatment of DEE-50 necessitate further investigation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 1-year-old male patient presented with developmental delay, seizures, and anaemia at 3 months of age. He further developed refractory status epilepticus (SE), rapid deterioration of cognitive and motor function, and even became comatose at 5 months of age. Whole-exome sequencing of trios (WES-trios) revealed a compound heterozygous variant in the CAD gene, with one locus inherited from his father (c.1252C>T: p.Q418* nonsense mutation) and one from his mother (c.6628G>A: p.G2210S, missense mutation). This compound heterozygous CAD variant was unreported in the Human Gene Mutation Database. After uridine treatment, his cognitive faculties dramatically improved and he remained seizure-free. Forty two cases with CAD gene mutation reported in the literatures were reviewed. Among them, 90% had onset before 3 years of age, with average of 1.6±1.8 years old. The average age of diagnosis was 7.7 ± 10 years. The mortality rate was approximately 9.5%, with all reported deaths occurring in patients without uridine treatment. The clinical entity could be improved dramatically when the patient treated with uridine. CONCLUSIONS: We present a boy with DEE 50 caused by novel CAD gene mutations and reviewed the clinical features of 42 patients reported previously. DEE 50 has early onset, refractory seizures, even status epilepticus leading to death, with favorable response to treatment with oral uridine. Early uridine treatment is recommended if CAD defect is suspected or genetically diagnosed. This study enhances the knowledge of DEE 50 and expands the spectrum of CAD gene mutations.",

      "abstract": "Flavone glycosides, their aglycones, and metabolites are the major phytochemicals in dietary intake. However, there are still many unknowns about the cellular utilization and active sites of these natural products. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in the endoplasmic reticulum have gene polymorphism distribution in the population and widely mediate the absorption and metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds by catalyzing the covalent addition of glucuronic acid and various lipophilic chemicals. Firstly, we found that rutin, a typical flavone O-glycoside, has a stronger UGT2B7 binding effect than its metabolites. After testing a larger number of flavonoids with different aglycones, their aglycones, and metabolites, we demonstrated that typical dietary flavone O-glycosides generally have high binding affinities towards UGT2B7 protein, but the flavone C-glycosides and the phenolic acid metabolites of flavones had no significant effect on this. With the disposition of 4-methylumbelliferone examined by HPLC assay, we determined that 10 μM rutin and nicotifiorin could significantly inhibit the activity of recombinant UGT2B7 protein, which is stronger than isovitexin, vitexin, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. In addition, in vitro experiments showed that in normal and doxorubicin-induced lipid composition, both flavone O-glycosides rutin and flavone C-glycosides isovitexin at 10 μM had no significant effect on the expression of UGT1A1, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 genes for 24 h exposure. The obtained results enrich the regulatory properties of dietary flavone glycosides, aglycones, and metabolites towards the catalysis of UGTs and will contribute to the establishment of a precise nutritional intervention system based on lipid bilayers and theories of nutrients on endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria communication.",

This rare disease, characterized by developmental delay, intractable seizures and anaemia, is amenable to treatment with uridine. We present a patient with macrocytic anaemia, elevated haemoglobin-A2 levels, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis and target cells in the blood smear, and mild developmental delay. A next-generation sequencing panel revealed biallelic variants in CAD. Functional studies did not support complete abrogation of protein function; however, the patient responded to uridine supplement. We conclude that biallelic hypomorphic CAD variants may cause a primarily haematological phenotype.",

      "abstract": "Complement component 3 (C3) deficiency has recently been known as a cause of constipation, without studies on the therapeutic efficacy. To evaluate the therapeutic agents against C3-deficiency-induced constipation, improvements in the constipation-related parameters and the associated molecular mechanisms were examined in FVB/N-C3em1Hlee/Korl knockout (C3 KO) mice treated with uridine (Urd) and the aqueous extract of Liriope platyphylla L. (AEtLP) with laxative activity. The stool parameters and gastrointestinal (GI) transit were increased in Urd- and AEtLP-treated C3 KO mice compared with the vehicle (Veh)-treated C3 KO mice. Urd and AEtLP treatment improved the histological structure, junctional complexes of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB), mucin secretion ability, and water retention capacity. Also, an improvement in the composition of neuronal cells, the regulation of excitatory function mediated via the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), and the regulation of the inhibitory function mediated via the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) were detected in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of Urd- and AEtLP-treated C3 KO mice. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that C3-deficiency-induced constipation can improve with treatment with Urd and AEtLP via the regulation of the mucin secretion ability, water retention capacity, and ENS function.",

Treatment of bacteria or cell lines with the active form of molnupiravir, β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, or EIDD-1931), induces mutations in DNA. Yet these results contrast in vivo genotoxicity studies conducted during registration of the drug. Using a CRISPR screen, we found that inactivating the pyrimidine salvage pathway component uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (Uck2) renders cells more tolerant of NHC. Short-term exposure to NHC increased the mutation rate in a mouse myeloid cell line, with most mutations being T:A to C:G transitions. Inactivating Uck2 impaired the mutagenic activity of NHC, whereas over-expression of Uck2 enhanced mutagenesis. UCK2 is upregulated in many cancers and cell lines. Our results suggest differences in ribonucleoside metabolism contribute to the variable mutagenicity of NHC observed in cancer cell lines and primary tissues.",

      "abstract": "Vericiguat (Verquvo; US: Merck, other countries: Bayer) is a novel drug for the treatment of chronic heart failure. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the primary route of metabolism for vericiguat is glucuronidation, mainly catalyzed by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 and to a lesser extent UGT1A1. Whereas a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of the UGT1A9 inhibitor mefenamic acid showed a 20% exposure increase, the effect of UGT1A1 inhibitors has not been assessed clinically. This modeling study describes a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approach to complement the clinical DDI liability assessment and support prescription labeling. A PBPK model of vericiguat was developed based on in vitro and clinical data, verified against data from the mefenamic acid DDI study, and applied to assess the UGT1A1 DDI liability by running an in silico DDI study with the UGT1A1 inhibitor atazanavir. A minor effect with an area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio of 1.12 and a peak plasma concentration ratio of 1.04 was predicted, which indicates that there is no clinically relevant DDI interaction anticipated. Additionally, the effect of potential genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 was evaluated, which showed that an average modest increase of up to 1.7-fold in AUC may be expected in the case of concomitantly reduced UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 activity for subpopulations expressing non-wild-type variants for both isoforms. This study is a first cornerstone to qualify the PK-Sim platform for use of UGT-mediated DDI predictions, including PBPK models of perpetrators, such as mefenamic acid and atazanavir, and sensitive UGT substrates, such as dapagliflozin and raltegravir.",

Injection of 4 µg neurotoxin evoked a 70% decrease in the time the experimental animal spent on the rod in the RotaRod test, an increase in the amount of lipid peroxides in blood serum and cerebral-cortex mitochondria and the rate of reactive oxygen species formation, and a decrease in Ca2+ retention in mitochondria. Herewith, lymphocytes featured an increase in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, a cytosolic enzyme of glycolysis, without changes in succinate-dehydrogenase activity. Structural changes occurring in the SN and striatum manifested themselves in the destruction of mitochondria, degeneration of neurons and synapses, and stratification of myelin sheaths in them. Subcutaneous injections of 30 µg/kg uridine for 22 days restored the neurotoxin-induced changes in these parameters to levels close to the control. 5-Hydroxydecanoate (5 mg/kg), a specific mitoK-ATP channel inhibitor, eliminated the beneficial effect of uridine for almost all characteristics tested, indicating the involvement of the mitoK-ATP channel in the protective effect of uridine. The mechanism of the protective effect of uridine and its therapeutic applications for the prevention and treatment of PD are discussed.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In this case report we describe two patients with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) overdose due to an unintentional increased infusion rate in which treatment with uridine triacetate was considered. Where previous case reports focus on the use of uridine triacetate in case of toxicity, this case report shows why it should be considered to abstain from the use of uridine triacetate. CASE REPORTS: The first patient is a 71-year-old woman who received 1200 mg/m2 5-FU in 2 h instead of 23 h. The second patient is a 74-year-old woman who received 2600 mg/m2 5-FU in 13 h instead of 24 h. The DPYD genotype of both patients was tested before the start of therapy and was found to be normal. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Both patients received best supportive care and were admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring of acute manifestations of toxicity. The first patient did not develop toxicity. The second patient did develop toxicity, but recovered completely. DISCUSSION: The rationale for abstaining from the use of uridine triacetate was the inadequacy of evidence backing its clinical and cost-effectiveness and the fact that uridine triacetate is not registered for the use in the European Union. Comparison of clinical outcomes of the already published open-label cohort with clinical outcomes of a comparable, well-described, best supportive care cohort is required before the added value of uridine triacetate can be determined. In addition, there is a need for a valid predictor of toxicity after fluoropyrimidine overdose.",

METHODS: Consecutive adults on lamotrigine monotherapy or lamotrigine + valproate co-treatment undergoing routine therapeutic drug monitoring, otherwise generally healthy and free of interacting drugs, were genotyped for UGT2B7 -161C > T and UGT1A4*3 c.142 T > G. Heterozygous, variant homozygous, or combined heterozygous/variant homozygous subjects were compared to their wt controls for dose-adjusted lamotrigine troughs with adjustment for age, sex, body weight, rs7668258/rs2011425, polymorphisms of efflux transporter proteins ABCG2 c.421C > A (rs2231142) and ABCB1 1236C > T (rs1128503), and level of exposure to valproate using covariate entropy balancing. RESULTS: Of the 471 included patients, 328 (69.6%) were on monotherapy and 143 were co-treated with valproate. Dose-adjusted lamotrigine troughs in UGT2B7 -161C > T heterozygous (CT, n = 237) or variant homozygous (TT, n = 115) subjects were closely similar to those in their wt controls (CC, n = 119): geometric means ratios (GMRs) (frequentist and Bayes) 1.00 (95%CI 0.86-1.16) and 1.00 (95%CrI 0.83-1.22) for CT vs. CC; and 0.97 (0.81-1.17) and 0.97 (0.80-1.20) for TT vs. CC subjects. Lamotrigine troughs were also closely similar in UGT1A4*3 c.142 T > G variant carriers (n = 106: 102 TG + 4 GG subjects) and wt controls (TT, n = 365): GMR = 0.95 (0.81-1.12) frequentist, 0.96 (0.80-1.16) Bayes. GMRs for variant carriers vs. wt controls were around unity also at different levels of exposure to valproate. CONCLUSION: Dose-adjusted lamotrigine troughs in epilepsy patients with variant UGT2B7 -161C > T or UGT1A4*3 c.142 T > G alleles are equivalent to those in their respective wt peers.",

      "abstract": "Uridine is a key metabolite used as a substrate for the production of DNA, RNA, and glucose, and it is mainly synthesized in the liver. Currently, it is not known whether uridine levels are altered in the tumor microenvironment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and whether uridine can be a target for tumor therapy. In this study, the detection of genes associated with de novo uridine synthesis, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase (CAD) (n = 115), and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) (n = 115) in HCC tissues through tissue microarrays revealed that the expression of CAD and DHODH was higher in tumor compared with paraneoplastic tissues. Next, we collected tumor tissues from surgically resected HCC patients and the corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues (n = 46) for LC-MS/MS assays. The results showed that the median and interquartile ranges of uridine content in non-tumor and tumor tissues were 640.36 (504.45-807.43) and 484.22 (311.91-626.73) nmol/g, respectively. These results suggest that uridine metabolism is disturbed in HCC patients. To further investigate whether uridine can be used as a tumor-therapeutic target, a series of high concentrations of uridine were incubated with HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that uridine dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of HCC cells by activating the ferroptosis pathway. Overall, these results reveal for the first time the range of uridine content in human HCC tissues and suggest that uridine may be a new target for HCC therapy."

This is mediated in part by a complex tumour microenvironment3, low vascularity4, and metabolic aberrations5,6. Although altered metabolism drives tumour progression, the spectrum of metabolites used as nutrients by PDA remains largely unknown. Here we identified uridine as a fuel for PDA in glucose-deprived conditions by assessing how more than 175 metabolites impacted metabolic activity in 21 pancreatic cell lines under nutrient restriction. Uridine utilization strongly correlated with the expression of uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1), which we demonstrate liberates uridine-derived ribose to fuel central carbon metabolism and thereby support redox balance, survival and proliferation in glucose-restricted PDA cells. In PDA, UPP1 is regulated by KRAS-MAPK signalling and is augmented by nutrient restriction. Consistently, tumours expressed high UPP1 compared with non-tumoural tissues, and UPP1 expression correlated with poor survival in cohorts of patients with PDA. Uridine is available in the tumour microenvironment, and we demonstrated that uridine-derived ribose is actively catabolized in tumours. Finally, UPP1 deletion restricted the ability of PDA cells to use uridine and blunted tumour growth in immunocompetent mouse models. Our data identify uridine utilization as an important compensatory metabolic process in nutrient-deprived PDA cells, suggesting a novel metabolic axis for PDA therapy.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the clinical features of children with uridine responsive developmental epileptic encephalopathy 50 (DEE50) caused by CAD gene variants. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 6 patients diagnosed with uridine-responsive DEE50 caused by CAD gene variants at Beijing Children's Hospital and Peking University First Hospital from 2018 to 2022. The epileptic seizures, anemia, peripheral blood smear, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visual evoked potential (VEP), genotype features and the therapeutic effect of uridine were descriptively analyzed. Results: A total of 6 patients, including 3 boys and 3 girls, aged 3.5(3.2,5.8) years, were enrolled in this study. All patients presented with refractory epilepsy, anemia with anisopoikilocytosis and global developmental delay with regression. The age of epilepsy onset was 8.5 (7.5, 11.0) months, and focal seizures were the most common seizure type (6 cases). Anemia ranged from mild to severe. Four patients had peripheral blood smears prior to uridine administration, showing erythrocytes of variable size and abnormal morphology, and normalized at 6 (2, 8) months after uridine supplementation. Two patients suffered from strabismus, 3 patients had VEP examinations, indicating of suspicious optic nerve involvement, and normal fundus examinations. VEP was re-examined at 1 and 3 months after uridine supplementation, suggesting significant improvement or normalization. Cranial MRI were performed at 5 patients, demonstrating cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. They had cranial MRI re-examined after uridine treatment with a duration of 1.1 (1.0, 1.8) years, indicating significant improvement in brain atrophy. All patients received uridine orally at a dose of 100 mg/(kg·d), the age at initiation of uridine treatment was 1.0 (0.8, 2.5) years, and the duration of treatment was 2.4 (2.2, 3.0) years. Immediate cession of seizures was observed within days to a week after uridine supplementation. Four patients received uridine monotherapy and were seizure free for 7 months, 2.4 years, 2.4 years and 3.0 years respectively. One patient achieved seizure free for 3.0 years after uridine supplementation and had discontinued uridine for 1.5 years. Two patients were supplemented with uridine combined with 1 to 2 anti-seizure medications and had a reduced seizure frequency of 1 to 3 times per year, and they had achieved seizure free for 8 months and 1.4 years respectively. Conclusions: The clinical manifestations of DEE50 caused by CAD gene variants present a triad of refractory epilepsy, anemia with anisopoikilocytosis, and psychomotor retardation with regression, accompanied by suspected optic nerve involvement, all of which respond to uridine treatment. Prompt diagnosis and immediate uridine supplementation could lead to significant clinical improvement.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil. Toxicity can occur during therapy as well as acutely with overdose and particular genetic susceptibilities. Uridine triacetate is an effective antidote if given within 96 h of exposure. This study seeks to characterize accidental and intentional capecitabine exposures and uridine triacetate use, about which little has been published. METHODS: A retrospective review of capecitabine exposures from 30 April 2001 to 31 December 2021 reported to a statewide poison control center was performed. All single-substance oral exposures were included. RESULTS: In total, 81 of 128 reviewed cases were included, with a median age of 63 years. In total, 49 were acute-on-chronic exposures and 32 were acute exposures in capecitabine-naïve patients, 29 of which were accidental. Fifty-six (69%) were managed at home. Of these, none later recontacted the poison control center to report symptoms or were known to have later had healthcare facility evaluations. Of the 25 cases presenting for healthcare facility evaluation, 4 were acutely symptomatic. Thirteen were eligible for uridine triacetate, and six received it; no new or progressive toxicity was reported after. Three developed mild latent toxicity; otherwise, no morbidity or mortality was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Accidental acute-on-chronic and acute ingestions of capecitabine appear to be well tolerated; most cases were managed at home. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the threshold at which toxicity may present following exposures. The threshold may vary individually given genetic susceptibilities. Management was heterogeneous, likely reflecting inadequate guidelines. Further research is needed to better delineate at-risk populations and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Ligand activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) accelerates keratinocyte differentiation and the formation of the epidermal permeability barrier. Several classes of lipids, including ceramides, are critical to the epidermal permeability barrier. In normal human epidermal keratinocytes, the AHR ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, increased RNA levels of ceramide metabolism and transport genes: uridine diphosphate glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), ABCA12, GBA1, and SMPD1. Levels of abundant skin ceramides were also increased by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. These included the metabolites synthesized by UGCG, glucosylceramides, and acyl glucosylceramides. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequence analysis and luciferase reporter assays identified UGCG as a direct AHR target. The AHR antagonist, GNF351, inhibited the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-mediated RNA and transcriptional increases. Tapinarof, an AHR ligand approved for the treatment of psoriasis, increased UGCG RNA, protein, and its lipid metabolites hexosylceramides as well as increased the RNA expression of ABCA12, GBA1, and SMPD1. In Ahr-null mice, Ugcg RNA and hexosylceramides were lower than those in the wild type. These results indicate that the AHR regulates the expression of UGCG, a ceramide-metabolizing enzyme required for ceramide trafficking, keratinocyte differentiation, and epidermal permeability barrier formation.",

      "abstract": "Uridine contains the chromophore uracil, a base forming part of RNA. In the range 240-290 nm, the absorption spectra of uridine and DNA are very similar and correspond to the spectral inactivation sensitivity of almost all microorganisms. This makes the uridine (absorption maximum 262 nm) an ideal actinometer for determining the germicidal photon flux in the range of 240 to 290 nm. Uridine actinometry is a simple, environmental-friendly, and easy-to-operate actinometry. Thanks to the uridine absorbance spectrum, it was found to be a perfect fit for the photon flux validation of UVC systems. Conventional UV disinfection systems are generally based on low-pressure (LP) mercury lamps which emit at 254 nm. On the other hand, UV light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) are a relatively new source of UV light for water treatment, emitting at various wavelengths. This protocol suggests an accurate, simple, easy to operate and straightforward way to determine the photon flux of UVC systems. Contain between 1 and 3 bullet points highlighting the customization rather than the steps of the procedure.•Because of the uridine absorbance spectrum, it is an ideal actinometer for photon flux validation of UVC systems.•Initial uridine concentration and photoproduct absorbance impact the kinetic order and quantum yield.•The protocol for UVC uridine actinometry is appropriate for UV-LP and UV-LED sources for water disinfection."

Here, we have characterised another uridine analogue, 5-ethynyluridine (EU), which has an ethynyl moiety. We show that this uridine analogue does not cause immune activation in human macrophages, as it does not induce interleukin-6 secretion or expression of the inflammatory and antiviral genes MX1, PKR, and TAP2. Moreover, EU allows for prolonged expression, as shown with mRNA coding for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Side-by-side comparisons of EU with unmodified, Ψ, and mΨ revealed that EU-modified mRNA is expressed at lower levels, but confers similar stability and low immunogenicity to the other uridine analogues. Furthermore, structure analysis of modified mRNAs suggests that the observed phenotype is largely independent of RNA folding. Thus, EU is a potential candidate for RNA-based vaccines and therapeutics.",

To test and monitor different UV-C reactor designs, a photochemical actinometer is required that gives reliable UV-C dose values and is non-toxic allowing frequent control of the production chain. Here, a variable concentrated aqueous uridine solution is tested as a photochemical actinometer. Uridine reacts at 262 nm by photohydration to a single photoproduct not absorbing any light. A concentration dependent quantum yield (Ф) was quantified in the range of 0.2-3.0 mM uridine. Results show that uridine is as accurate as the commonly accepted iodide/iodate actinometry, but not as precise. Especially at higher concentrations a higher number of measurements becomes necessary. Further, a temperature correction is presented for 10 °C > ϑ > 30 °C. Taking these results into account, uridine can certainly be considered as a non-toxic dosimeter for UV-C systems."

Hereditary dihydropyrimdine deaminase (DPD), thymidylate synthase mutations and drug overdose may lead to life-threatening toxicities. Uridine triacetate (UTA) is an emergency treatment for overdoses and early onset, severe or life-threatening toxicities from fluoropyrimidines. It is approved for use in adults and children within 96 h of last fluoropyrimidine administration. We present the case of a 64-year-old male treated with 5-FU and oxaliplatin as adjuvant systemic therapy for stage IIIA rectal cancer who developed delayed central nervous system toxicity 18 days after initiating chemotherapy. He had rapidly worsening encephalopathy and ataxia. Laboratory workups, MRI brain and EEG were negative. He was started on UTA with concerns of 5-FU toxicity due to the life-threatening nature of his condition even beyond the recommended 96-h time cut-off. He had rapid improvement in clinical status and resolution of encephalopathy. DPD deficiency testing later resulted as heterozygous for IVS14+1G>A allele indicating enzyme deficiency. This report demonstrates the importance of identifying delayed side effects with fluoropyrimidine therapy and potential treatment for reversing these effects. We also did an extensive literature review and obtained reports from the uridine triacetate clinical trials on patients receiving UTA after the 96-h cut-off. Based on our experience and previous published reports, a patient developing life-threatening delayed 5-FU toxicity should also be considered for UTA on a case-by-case basis."

      "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by the loss of functional dystrophin that secondarily causes systemic metabolic impairment in skeletal muscles and cardiomyocytes. The nutraceutical approach is considered as a possible complementary therapy for this pathology. In this work, we have studied the effect of pyrimidine nucleoside uridine (30 mg/kg/day for 28 days, i.p.), which plays an important role in cellular metabolism, on the development of DMD in the skeletal muscles of dystrophin deficient mdx mice, as well as its effect on the mitochondrial dysfunction that accompanies this pathology. We found that chronic uridine administration reduced fibrosis in the skeletal muscles of mdx mice, but it had no effect on the intensity of degeneration/regeneration cycles and inflammation, pseudohypetrophy, and muscle strength of the animals. Analysis of TEM micrographs showed that uridine also had no effect on the impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure of mdx mouse skeletal muscle. The administration of uridine was found to lead to an increase in the expression of the Drp1 and Parkin genes, which may indicate an increase in the intensity of organelle fission and the normalization of mitophagy. Uridine had little effect on OXPHOS dysfunction in mdx mouse mitochondria, and moreover, it was suppressed in the mitochondria of wild type animals. At the same time, uridine restored the transport of potassium ions and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species; however, this had no effect on the impaired calcium retention capacity of mdx mouse mitochondria. The obtained results demonstrate that the used dose of uridine only partially prevents mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscles during Duchenne dystrophy, though it mitigates the development of destructive processes in skeletal muscles.",

      "abstract": "Long-term hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus is associated with complex damage to cardiomyocytes and the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the myocardium. Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, plays an important role in cellular metabolism and is used to improve cardiac function. Herein, the antidiabetic potential of uridine (30 mg/kg/day for 21 days, i.p.) and its effect on mitochondrial homeostasis in the heart tissue were examined in a high-fat diet-streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes in C57BL/6 mice. We found that chronic administration of uridine to diabetic mice normalized plasma glucose and triglyceride levels and the heart weight/body weight ratio and increased the rate of glucose utilization during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Analysis of TEM revealed that uridine prevented diabetes-induced ultrastructural abnormalities in mitochondria and sarcomeres in ventricular cardiomyocytes. In diabetic heart tissue, the mRNA level of Ppargc1a decreased and Drp1 and Parkin gene expression increased, suggesting the disturbances of mitochondrial biogenesis, fission, and mitophagy, respectively. Uridine treatment of diabetic mice restored the mRNA level of Ppargc1a and enhanced Pink1 gene expression, which may indicate an increase in the intensity of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, and as a consequence, mitochondrial turnover. Uridine also reduced oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction and suppressed lipid peroxidation, but it had no significant effect on the impaired calcium retention capacity and potassium transport in the heart mitochondria of diabetic mice. Altogether, these findings suggest that, along with its hypoglycemic effect, uridine has a protective action against diabetes-mediated functional and structural damage to cardiac mitochondria and disruption of mitochondrial quality-control systems in the diabetic heart.",

Metabolism of vixotrigine is primarily through glucuronidation, resulting in the major M13 metabolite. Two additional major metabolites formed are M14 and M16. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor, valproic acid, on vixotrigine pharmacokinetics. METHODS: This open-label, fixed-sequence, phase I study enrolled 30 healthy volunteers who received a single dose of vixotrigine 150 mg on day 1 and day 16 following an 8-h fast. On days 8-22, volunteers received valproic acid 500 mg three times daily. A mixed-effects model was used to analyze the effect of valproic acid on the natural log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of vixotrigine and its metabolites including maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity. RESULTS: Vixotrigine systemic exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity) was increased by approximately 70% following the addition of valproic acid with a negligible effect on maximum concentration. Valproic acid administration also impacted vixotrigine metabolites: M13 exposure decreased by approximately 50% and M13 maximum concentration decreased by approximately 70%; increased exposure was noted for the M14 (approximately 100%) and M16 (approximately 70%) metabolites.

      "abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA) is well-known as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. It has been reported that HDAC inhibitors enhance basal and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand-induced aryl hydrocarbon receptor-responsive gene expression. Other studies suggested that HDAC inhibition might significantly activate the NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Moreover, VPA activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPK pathways regulate Nrf2 transactivation domain activity. Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6 is one of the important isoforms to affect drug pharmacokinetics. UGT1A6 gene is regulated transcriptionally by AhR and Nrf2. The present study aimed to investigate whether UGT1A6 expression was changed by VPA and to elucidate the mechanism of the alteration. Following VPA treatment for 72 h in Caco-2 cells, UGT1A6 mRNA was increased by 7.9-fold. Moreover, UGT1A6 mRNA was increased by other HDAC inhibitors, suggesting that HDAC inhibition caused the UGT1A6 mRNA induction. AhR and Nrf2 proteins in the nucleus of Caco-2 cells were increased by 1.5- and 1.7-fold, respectively, following the VPA treatment. However, VPA treatment did not activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways in Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, we observed that VPA induced UGT1A6 mRNA expression via AhR and Nrf2 pathways, but not via the ERK or JNK pathways.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is associated with synaptic plasticity which is considered essential for long-term potentiation (LTP). The composition of extracellular matrix (ECM), in part, plays a role in REM sleep-associated synaptic functioning. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of uridine administration on levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in rats subjected to REM sleep deprivation (REMSD). REMSD was induced by modified multiple platform method for 96-hour. Rats were randomized to receive either saline or uridine (1 mmol/kg) intraperitoneally twice a day for four days. Rats were then decapitated and their hippocampi were dissected for analyzing the levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 by Western-blotting and the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by Gelatin zymography. REMSD resulted in reduced levels of MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-3 and activity of MMP-9 in saline-treated rats, while uridine treatment significantly enhanced their impairment. TIMP-1 was enhanced following REMSD but uridine treatment had no significant effect on TIMP-1 levels. MMP-2, TIMP-2 levels and MMP-2 activity were not affected by either REMSD or uridine administration. These data show that REMSD significantly affects ECM composition which is ameliorated by uridine administration suggesting a possible use of uridine in sleep disorders.",

UGT1As are enzymes that metabolize the active form of irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10 hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), by glucuronidation in the liver. They are widely known as predictive factors of severe adverse effects, such as neutropenia and diarrhea. Some studies have suggested that variants of UGT1As affect SN-38 glucuronidation activities, thus exerting severe adverse effects. We aimed to identify UGT1A isoforms that show SN-38 glucuronidation activity and determine the relationship between UGT1A variants and SN-38 glucuronidation in vitro. We found that UGT1A1 and UGT1A6-UGT1A10 displayed SN-38 glucuronidation activity. Among these, UGT1A1 was the most active. Furthermore, the variants of these isoforms showed decreased SN-38 glucuronidation activity. In our study, we compared the different variants of UGT1As, such as UGT1A1.6, UGT1A1.7, UGT1A1.27, UGT1A1.35, UGT1A7.3, UGT1A8.4, UGT1A10M59I, and UGT1A10T202I, to determine the differences in the reduction of glucuronidation. Our study elucidates the relationship between UGT1A variants and the level of glucuronidation associated with each variant. Therefore, testing can be done before the initiation of irinotecan treatment to predict potential toxicities and adverse effects.",

Research on the pathogenesis of ARDS has made great progress, but the exact pathogenesis of ARDS has not been fully elucidated. Up to now, the prevention and treatment of ARDS is still an important scientific problem that needs to be solved urgently. In this work, we analyzed the effect of uridine on ARDS. An ARDS model was successfully constructed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Western-blotting, IFA, ELISA, RT-PCT and CLSM were conducted to investigate the effect of uridine on ARDS and insulin resistance, and the results showed that lung histopathological alterations were significantly attenuated by uridine treatment. Further work showed that the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly down-regulated in the lung tissue after treatment with uridine. Additionally, the numbers of total cells and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were also decreased in the uridine-treated ARDS mice. We further explored the potential mechanism by which uridine could treat ARDS, and the results indicated that NF-κB signaling was down-regulated by uridine treatment. Next, we studied insulin sensitivity in the ARDS mice, and found that insulin signaling was significantly down-regulated, and uridine could enhance insulin sensitivity in the ARDS mice model. Furthermore, we found that the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress were decreased by uridine treatment, which may be the potential mechanism by which uridine could improve insulin sensitivity. Taken together, the current work provides evidence that uridine can serve as a potential drug to treat ARDS and insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Primary mitochondrial diseases (PMD) are a large, heterogeneous group of genetic disorders affecting mitochondrial function, mostly by disrupting the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Understanding the cellular metabolic re-wiring occurring in PMD is crucial for the development of novel diagnostic tools and treatments, as PMD are often complex to diagnose and most of them currently have no effective therapy. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the cellular metabolic consequences of OXPHOS dysfunction and based on the metabolic signature, to design new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. METHODS: In vitro assays were performed in skin-derived fibroblasts obtained from patients with diverse PMD and validated in pharmacological models of OXPHOS dysfunction. Proliferation was assessed using the Incucyte technology. Steady-state glucose and glutamine tracing studies were performed with LC-MS quantification of cellular metabolites. The therapeutic potential of nutritional supplements was evaluated by assessing their effect on proliferation and on the metabolomics profile. Successful therapies were then tested in a in vivo lethal rotenone model in zebrafish. RESULTS: OXPHOS dysfunction has a unique metabolic signature linked to an NAD+/NADH imbalance including depletion of TCA intermediates and aspartate, and increased levels of glycerol-3-phosphate. Supplementation with pyruvate and uridine fully rescues this altered metabolic profile and the subsequent proliferation deficit. Additionally, in zebrafish, the same nutritional treatment increases the survival after rotenone exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reinforce the importance of the NAD+/NADH imbalance following OXPHOS dysfunction in PMD and open the door to new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for PMD.",

This study investigated the regenerative potential and long-term functional effects of Uridine treatment in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive sham surgery plus saline (Sham group), right sciatic nerve transection and primary repair plus saline (Control group), right sciatic nerve transection, and primary repair plus 500 mg/kg Uridine (Uridine group). Saline or Uridine was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for seven days, and the rats were monitored for 12 weeks after surgery. We evaluated electrophysiological and functional recovery using electromyography (EMG) and sciatic functional index (SFI) at six and 12 weeks, respectively. At 12 weeks, rats were decapitated and their right sciatic nerves were examined in macroscopic and histomorphologic manners. RESULTS: Functional evaluation by SFI and sciatic nerve conduction velocity analyzed by EMG both decreased in the Control group but recovered in the Uridine group 12 weeks after surgery. Additionally, upon experiment completion, Uridine treatment was observed to enhance nerve adherence, separability scores, and the number of myelinated axons. CONCLUSION: These results reveal that short-term Uridine treatment provides morphological and electrophysiological benefits, which are represented by long-term functional improvement in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. These findings validate and extend our knowledge on Uridine's regenerative effects in peripheral nerve injuries."

In this study, we asked whether metabolic programs underlying regenerative capability might be conserved across species, and if so, whether such metabolic drivers might be harnessed to promote tissue repair. To this end, we conducted metabolomic analyses in two vertebrate organ regeneration models: the axolotl limb blastema and antler stem cells. To further reveal why young individuals have higher regenerative capacity than the elderly, we also constructed metabolic profiles for primate juvenile and aged tissues, as well as young and aged human stem cells. In joint analyses, we uncovered that active pyrimidine metabolism and fatty acid metabolism correlated with higher regenerative capacity. Furthermore, we identified a set of regeneration-related metabolite effectors conserved across species. One such metabolite is uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, which can rejuvenate aged human stem cells and promote regeneration of various tissues in vivo. These observations will open new avenues for metabolic intervention in tissue repair and regeneration."

The senescence of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is one of the important factors that causes OA. Here, the effect of uridine (which is a functional food derived from plants or animals) on senescence of chondrocytes and MSCs was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro experiments. For this, we established the senescence model of chondrocyte and MSCs in vitro, and established the OA model in vivo, and a series of experiments (such as CLSM, ELISA, Western blot, etc.) were conducted to evaluate the effect of uridine on chondrocyte and MSCs senescence. The results showed that uridine could alleviate chondrocyte and MSCs senescence in vitro by evaluating a series of aging markers. Furthermore, uridine could also relieve OA in vivo. In summary, in the present work, we found that uridine can alleviate chondrocyte and MSCs senescence in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Uridine has shown great potential in the treatment of OA in vivo, suggesting that uridine could be used to treat and prevent OA induced by aging, and has potential clinical applications in future.",

      "abstract": "At present, liver fibrosis is a major challenge of global health. When hepatocyte regeneration cannot compensate for hepatocyte death, it will develop into liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease. Initially, collagen produced by myofibroblasts plays a role in maintaining liver integrity, but excessive collagen accumulation can inhibit the residual liver function, leading to liver failure. At present, many scientists are actively looking for drugs to alleviate liver fibrosis. In the current study, we investigated the potential role of uridine in the treatment of liver fibrosis (uridine is a plant/animal-derived pyrimidine nucleoside, therefore uridine can also be ingested and absorbed by the body, accompanied by the process of food intake). For this, we systematically studied the effect of uridine on CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in vitro and in vivo through a series of technologies, such as Western blot, laser confocal scanning microscope, ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The experimental results showed that uridine can effectively reduce the accumulation of collagen in liver. Furthermore, uridine can improve the activity of liver cells and alleviate CCl4-induced liver injury. Furthermore, uridine can significantly alleviate the risk factors caused by hepatic stellate cell activation, uridine treatment significantly down-regulated the expression of α-SMA, collagen type-I and fibronectin. In conclusion, the current research shows that uridine can alleviate CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, suggesting that uridine can be used as a potential drug to alleviate liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, approved in 2020 for treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, provides a new option for a population with a historically poor prognosis with standard chemotherapy. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 poor metabolizers are at increased risk for profound neutropenia. This case discusses clinical implications of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1*28/*28 genotype in patients receiving sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old otherwise healthy pre-menopausal female of South Asian descent was diagnosed with non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. This was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and multiple lines of subsequent therapies. Upon finding bone metastasis, an additional six lines of therapy ensued. In total, 3.5 years post-diagnosis, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was started for disease transformation to triple-negative status. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was initiated at the Food and Drug Administration-approved 10 mg/kg/dose on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred after one dose. Pharmacogenomics testing identified the patient as a uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1*28 homozygous expressor. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was dose-reduced, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered due to the severity of neutropenia. The patient continued on sacituzumab govitecan-hziy until disease progression. DISCUSSION: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy's propensity to cause neutropenia is multifactorial. Although incidence of all-grade neutropenia from sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is elevated for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1*28 homozygous expressors, this does not translate to increased risk for febrile neutropenia. Detailed guidance is lacking regarding empiric dose adjustments or prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for these patients.1 Currently, pre-sacituzumab govitecan-hziy pharmacogenomics testing to identify uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 poor metabolizers is not recommended, and the cost-effectiveness of this approach is unclear.",

Deficiencies in SLC25A36 in mouse embryonic stem cells have been associated with mtDNA depletion as well as mitochondrial dysfunction.

We report the first known case of SLC25A36 deficiency in a 12-year-old patient with hypothyroidism, hyperinsulinism, hyperammonemia, chronical obstipation, short stature, along with language and general developmental delay. Whole exome analysis identified the homozygous mutation c.803dupT, p.Ser269llefs*35 in the SLC25A36 gene. Functional analysis of mutant SLC25A36 protein in proteoliposomes showed a virtually abolished transport activity. Immunoblotting results suggest that the mutant SLC25A36 protein in the patient undergoes fast degradation. Supplementation with oral uridine led to an improvement of thyroid function and obstipation, increase of growth and developmental progress. Our findings suggest an important role of SLC25A36 in hormonal regulations and oral uridine as a safe and effective treatment.",

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the standard of care for HI encephalopathy in term and near-term infants. However, TH may not always be available or efficacious, creating a need for novel or adjunctive neurotherapeutics. Using a near-term model of inflammation-sensitized HI brain injury in postnatal day (P) 17 ferrets, animals were randomized to either the control group (n = 43) or the HI-exposed groups: saline vehicle (Veh; n = 42), Ur (uridine monophosphate, n = 23), Epo (erythropoietin, n = 26), or TH (n = 24) to test their respective therapeutic effects. Motor development was assessed from P21 to P42 followed by analysis of cortical anatomy, ex vivo MRI, and neuropathology. HI animals took longer to complete the motor assessments compared to controls, which was exacerbated in the Ur group. Injury resulted in thinned white matter tracts and narrowed cortical sulci and gyri, which was mitigated in Epo-treated animals in addition to normalization of cortical neuropathology scores to control levels. TH and Epo treatment also resulted in region-specific improvements in diffusion parameters on ex vivo MRI; however, TH was not robustly neuroprotective in any behavioral or neuropathological outcome measures. Overall, Ur and TH did not provide meaningful neuroprotection after inflammation-sensitized HI brain injury in the ferret, and Ur appeared to worsen outcomes. By comparison, Epo appears to provide significant, though not complete, neuroprotection in this model.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Protein tyrosine kinases regulate osteoarthritis (OA) progression by activating a series of signal transduction pathways. However, the roles of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in OA remain obscure. This study was undertaken to identify specific PTPs involved in OA and investigate their underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The expression of 107 PTP genes in human OA cartilage was analyzed based on a single-cell sequencing data set. The enzyme activity of the PTP SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) was detected in primary chondrocytes after interleukin-1β (IL-1β) treatment and in human OA cartilage. Mice subjected to destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) and IL-1β-stimulated mouse primary chondrocytes were treated with an SHP-2 inhibitor or celecoxib (a drug used for the clinical treatment of OA). The function of SHP-2 in OA pathogenesis was further verified in Aggrecan-CreERT ;SHP2flox/flox mice. The downstream protein expression profile and dephosphorylated substrate of SHP-2 were examined by tandem mass tag labeling-based global proteomic analysis and stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture-labeled tyrosine phosphoproteomic analysis, respectively. RESULTS: SHP-2 enzyme activity significantly increased in human OA samples with serious articular cartilage injury and in IL-1β-stimulated mouse chondrocytes. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of SHP-2 ameliorated OA progression. SHP-2 inhibitors dramatically reduced the expression of cartilage degradation-related genes and simultaneously promoted the expression of cartilage synthesis-related genes. Mechanistically, SHP-2 inhibition suppressed the dephosphorylation of docking protein 1 and subsequently reduced the expression of uridine phosphorylase 1 and increased the uridine level, thereby contributing to the homeostasis of cartilage metabolism. CONCLUSION: SHP-2 is a novel accelerator of the imbalance in cartilage homeostasis. Specific inhibition of SHP-2 may ameliorate OA by maintaining the anabolic-catabolic balance.",

However, the effect of A. vulgaris essential oil on UGTs is unclear. In this study, A. vulgaris essential oil was shown to significantly induce the expression of the TcUgt86Dg transcript. Furthermore, treatment of TcUgt86Dg-silenced individuals with A. vulgaris essential oil resulted in higher mortality than for the control individuals, indicating that TcUgt86Dg is involved in detoxification of A. vulgaris essential oil in T. castaneum. The developmental expression profile showed that the expression of TcUgt86Dg in late adults was higher than in other developmental stages. Furthermore, the expression profile in adult tissues revealed higher expression of TcUgt86Dg in the head, antenna, fat body, and accessory gland than in other tissues. These data show that TcUgt86Dg may be involved in the metabolism of exogenous toxins by T. castaneum; thus, our results have elucidated one possible mechanism of resistance to A. vulgaris essential oil and provide a theoretical basis for a control scheme for T. castaneum.",

Two rat models were used: (1) acute myocardial ischemia induced by occlusion of the left coronary artery for 60 min; and (2) myocardial ischemia/reperfusion with 30-min ischemia and 120-min reperfusion. In both models, treatment with uridine (30 mg/kg) prevented a decrease in cell energy supply and in the activity of the antioxidant system, as well as an increase in the level of lipid hydroperoxides and diene conjugates. This led to a reduction of the necrosis zone in the myocardium and disturbances in the heart rhythm. The blocker of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium (mitoKATP) channel 5-hydroxydecanoate limited the positive effects of uridine. The data indicate that the cardioprotective action of uridine may be related to the activation of the mitoKATP channel. Intravenously injected uridine was more rapidly eliminated from the blood in hypoxia than in normoxia, and the level of the mitoKATP channel activator UDP in the myocardium after uridine administration increased. The results suggest that the use of uridine can be a potentially effective approach to the management of cardiovascular diseases.",

Endogenous nucleosides could be potential options since uridine has been reported to have an anti-inflammatory effect in asthma model. However, its molecular pathways and whether other nucleosides have similar therapeutic effects remain untouched. Thus, we herein report our investigation into the anti-inflammatory effects of guanosine and uridine, and the related inner signaling pathways in asthma model. Present study shows that administration of guanosine or uridine can reduce lung inflammation in OVA-challenged mice. Total cell counts in BALF, cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, OVA-specific IgE and mRNA level of Cxcl1, Cxlc3, IL-17 and Muc5ac were decreased in asthmatic mice after treatment. Besides, the production of IL-6 in LPS/IFN-γ induced THP-1 cells was also decreased by both nucleosides. In vivo and in vitro expressions of key molecules in the MAPK and NF-κB pathways were reduced after the treatment of both compounds. These findings suggest that guanosine has a similar potential therapeutic value in asthma as uridine and they exert anti-inflammatory effects through suppression of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways.",

      "abstract": "The methylglyoxal elicits diverse adverse effects on the body. Uridine diphosphate, an extracellular nucleotide, plays an important role as a signaling molecule controlling vascular tone. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between methylglyoxal and uridine diphosphate-induced carotid arterial contraction in rats. Additionally, we examined whether p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) would involve such responses. Organ baths were conducted to determine vascular reactivity in isolated carotid arterial rings, and western blotting was used for protein analysis. Treatment with methylglyoxal to carotid arterial rings showed concentration-dependent augmentation to uridine diphosphate-induced contraction in the absence and presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine, which is a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, whereas, methylglyoxal did not affect serotonin- or isotonic high K+-induced contraction in the presence of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Under nitric oxide synthase inhibition, SB203580, which is a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, suppressed uridine diphosphate-induced contraction in both the control and methylglyoxal-treated groups, and the difference in uridine diphosphate-induced contraction was abolished by SB203580 treatment. The levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK were increased by methylglyoxal in carotid arteries, not only under the basal condition but also under uridine diphosphate stimulation. The suppression of uridine diphosphate-induced contraction by a highly selective cell-permeable protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I was observed in the methylglyoxal-treated group but not in the controls. Moreover, methylglyoxal-induced augmentation of uridine diphosphate-induced contraction was prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine. These results suggest that methylglyoxal could enhance uridine diphosphate-induced contraction in rat carotid arteries and may be caused by activation of p38 MAPK and protein kinase C and increased oxidative stress.",

The type 2 cytokines interleukin 5 (IL-5) and IL-13 and the eosinophil-specific chemokine CCL11/CCL24/CCL26 axis recruit, activate, and regulate eosinophils in the airways. In this issue of the JCI, Karcz et al. identified a mechanism involving the nucleotide sugar UDP-glucose (UDP-G) and the purinergic receptor P2Y14R in amplifying eosinophil accumulation in the lung. During type 2 inflammation, UDP-G activates P2Y14R on eosinophils, inducing the cells to move and migrate into the lung. Pharmacologically or genetically inhibiting P2Y14R on eosinophils attenuated eosinophil infiltration and AHR. Future experiments, including identifying additional type 2 factors regulating P2Y14R expression on lung eosinophils, are necessary to ascertain the impact of targeting P2Y14R as an alternative or adjunctive therapy to current type 2 biologics for the treatment of asthma.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two adult male rats were equally randomized to Sham, Control, U100, and U500 groups. Sham rats received a sham operation by exposing the right sciatic nerve without transection, while those in the Control, U100, and U500 groups underwent right sciatic nerve transection followed by immediate primary anostomosis. Sham and Control groups received saline (0.9% NaCl) injections intraperitoneally (i.p.), while U100 and U500 groups received 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg uridine injections (i.p.), respectively, once a day for 7 days after the surgery. Rats in all the groups were sacrificed on the eighth day; sciatic nerve samples were analyzed for apoptosis by Western Blotting and for oxidation parameters including myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Uridine treatment at the dose of 500 mg/kg significantly decreased as apoptosis determined by Caspase-3/Actin ratio and exhibited significant anti-oxidant effects as determined by decreased levels of MPO and MDA as well as increased levels of SOD, GPx, and CAT compared to controls. Uridine at 100 mg/kg was only found to decrease the Caspase-3/Actin ratio, although it significantly decreased MDA and increased CAT levels compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Treatment with uridine reduces apoptosis and oxidation in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury dose-dependently. Thus, uridine may be beneficial in peripheral nerve regeneration by exhibiting anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is difficult to cure. HBV-specific immune tolerance plays a key role in HBV persistence, and enhancing cellular and humoral immunity will improve the control of HBV infection. The purpose of the study was to explore the anti-HBV and immunostimulatory effects of msiRNAs that introduce unpaired uridine bulges in the passenger strand. METHODS: msiRNAs targeting the HBV S and X genes were designed and named msiHBs and msiHBx, respectively. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with siRNA or msiRNA and the HBV replication-competent plasmid pHY106-wta or pHY106-X15. HepG2.215 cells were transfected with siRNA or msiRNA. The levels of HBsAg, HBeAg, and the cytokines TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the culture supernatant was detected by ELISA. The levels of intracellular HBV RNA, nuclear HBV replication intermediates, and HBV DNA in the supernatant were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and PCR. The levels of HBV replication intermediates were detected by Southern blotting. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were transfected with siRNA or msiRNA, and the levels of secreted cytokines IFN-α and IFN-β were detected by ELISA. The bioactivity of type I interferons in the supernatants was detected by the virus protection assay. RESULTS: msiHBx treatment led to a significant decrease in HBsAg (to a negative level) and HBV DNA (95.5%) in the supernatant and intrahepatocellular HBV replication intermediates (89.8%) in HepG2 cells with transient HBV replication and in HepG2.2.15 cells. There was no significant difference between msiHBx and siHBx in terms of the reduction in HBV proteins and HBV replication (P > 0.05). Compared with siHBx, msiHBx treatment of HepG2 cells transfected with the HBV replication-competent plasmid led to a significant increase in the levels of the antiviral cytokines TNF-α (3.3-fold), IFN-α (1.4-fold), and IFN-β (2.5-fold) (P < 0.01), without upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-6. The virus protection assay results showed msiHBx-mediated type I interferons effectively protected L929 cells against ECMV infection. CONCLUSIONS: msiHBx could effectively inhibit HBV expression and replication and induce an antiviral innate immune response without proinflammatory activation. The dual RNAi and immunostimulatory activity of msiRNAs may play an important role in the control of HBV infection.",

As endoribonuclease activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response, Nsp15 emerges as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Here we report the first structures with bound nucleotides and show how the enzyme specifically recognizes uridine moiety. In addition to a uridine site we present evidence for a second base binding site that can accommodate any base. The structure with a transition state analog, uridine vanadate, confirms interactions key to catalytic mechanisms. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. This acquired knowledge was instrumental in identifying Tipiracil, an FDA approved drug that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer, as a potential anti-COVID-19 drug. Using crystallography, biochemical, and whole-cell assays, we demonstrate that Tipiracil inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 by interacting with the uridine binding pocket in the enzyme's active site. Our findings provide new insights for the development of uracil scaffold-based drugs.",

To date, only about twenty patients have been described. We report a case of HOA with a novel variant in the UMPS gene. A 17-year-old Emirati girl was born to first-cousin parents. During the first year, she had recurrent, severe infections including disseminated varicella. After evaluation for immunodeficiency, an impression of immunodeficiency of unknown etiology was presumed. Frequent episodes of pancytopenia were also noted. Bone marrow biopsy showed trilineage megaloblastoid maturation with dysplastic changes that were refractory to hematinic therapy. Also, she was noted to have failure to thrive, developmental delay and epilepsy. She was referred to the Genetics clinic where whole-exome sequencing (WES) was done and showed a novel homozygous variant in the UMPS gene confirming a diagnosis of HOA. She was started on uridine triacetate after which she showed clinical, hematologic and biochemical improvement. Although extremely rare, hereditary orotic aciduria should be suspected in any child with megaloblastic bone marrow, immunodeficiency or when developmental delay and anemia coexist."

      "abstract": "In mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD), also known as prodromal AD, there is evidence for a pathologic shortage of uridine, choline, and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]), which are key nutrients needed by the brain. Preclinical and clinical evidence shows the importance of nutrient bioavailability to support the development and maintenance of brain structure and function in MCI and AD. Availability of key nutrients is limited in MCI, creating a distinct nutritional need for uridine, choline, and DHA. Evidence suggests that metabolic derangements associated with ageing and disease-related pathology can affect the body's ability to generate and utilize nutrients. This is reflected in lower levels of nutrients measured in the plasma and brains of individuals with MCI and AD dementia, and progressive loss of cognitive performance. The uridine shortage cannot be corrected by normal diet, making uridine a conditionally essential nutrient in affected individuals. It is also challenging to correct the choline shortfall through diet alone, because brain uptake from the plasma significantly decreases with ageing. There is no strong evidence to support the use of single-agent supplements in the management of MCI due to AD. As uridine and choline work synergistically with DHA to increase phosphatidylcholine formation, there is a compelling rationale to combine these nutrients. A multinutrient enriched with uridine, choline, and DHA developed to support brain function has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials covering a spectrum of dementia from MCI to moderate AD. A randomized controlled trial in subjects with prodromal AD showed that multinutrient intervention slowed brain atrophy and improved some measures of cognition. Based on the available clinical evidence, nutritional intervention should be considered as a part of the approach to the management of individuals with MCI due to AD, including adherence to a healthy, balanced diet, and consideration of evidence-based multinutrient supplements."

Timely translation into uridine supplementation, within 2-months of disease onset, allowed us to stop conventional anti-epileptic drugs and led to dramatic improvement in the clinical symptoms, with prompt cessation of seizures, resolution of anaemia, developmental progress, and prevention of development of severe and non-reversible manifestations. The remarkable recovery and prevention of advanced disease with prompt treatment, highlights the need to act immediately upon genetic diagnosis of a treatable disease. This further reinforces CAD deficiency as a treatable neurometabolic disorder and emphasises the need for a biomarker or genetic new born screening for early identification."

Our data have shown that four compounds from the series (18-21) possess strong activity against both TBEV strains. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of compounds 18-21 were between 15.1 and 3.7 μM depending on the virus strain, which along with low cytotoxicity resulted in high values of the selectivity index (SI).

These metabolites are known to be significant biomarkers of pyrimidine synthesis during the development of DHODH inhibitor drugs for treatment of several cancers and immunological disorders. Here we are reporting a validated LC-MS/MS assay for the quantitation of uridine and DHO in K2EDTA human plasma. Due to presence of endogenous uridine and DHO in the biological matrix, a surrogate matrix approach with bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution was used. Human plasma samples were spiked with stable isotope labeled internal standards, processed by protein precipitation, and analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Parallelism was successfully demonstrated between human plasma (the authentic matrix) and BSA (the surrogate matrix). The linear analytical ranges of the assay were set at 30.0-30,000 ng/mL for uridine and 3.00-3,000 ng/mL for DHO. This validated LC-MS/MS method demonstrated excellent accuracy and precision. The overall accuracy was between 91.9 % and 106 %, and the inter-assay precision (%CV) were less than 4.2 % for uridine in human plasma. The overall accuracy was between 92.8 % and 106 %, and the inter-assay precision (%CV) were less than 7.2 % for DHO in human plasma. Uridine and DHO were found to be stable in human plasma for at least 24 h at room temperature, 579 days when stored at -20 °C, 334 days when stored at -70 °C, and after five freeze/thaw cycles. The assay has been successfully applied to human plasma samples to support clinical studies.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, of a 60-day oral treatment: Group A (n=317) receiving nucleotides+B12 and Group B (n=317) receiving B vitamins. The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects in each group presenting adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints were visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at Visit 2 (day 30) and Visit 3 (day 60) in relation to pretreatment values, Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ) scores and finger-to-floor distance (FFD) (percentage of subjects per group presenting improvement ≥5 points and ≥3cm, respectively). RESULTS: Seventy-five (24%) and 105 (33%) subjects (P=0.21) presented 133 and 241 AEs, with 3159% of subjects presenting ≥2 AEs (P=0.0019) in Group A and Group B, respectively. Twenty-four subjects in Group B were discontinued due to AEs, while no AE-related discontinuations occurred in Group A (P<0.0001). VAS score reduction after 30 and 60 days of treatment was statistically significant (P<0.0001) in both groups, with Group A showing greater reduction at Visit 2 (P<0.0001). RMQ score improvement ≥5 points occurred in 99% of subjects from each group, and FFD improvement ≥3 cm occurred in all subjects. CONCLUSION: Treatment with nucleotides+B12 was associated with a lower number of total AEs, fewer AEs per subject, and no AE-related treatment discontinuation. Pain intensity (VAS) reduction was superior at 30 days of treatment in the nucleotides+B12 group and equivalent between groups at 60 days of treatment. Improvements in efficacy measures RMQ and FFD were observed in both groups at treatment days 30 and 60."

Its non-ionized analog has already demonstrated biological properties by reducing adverse effects caused by the chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In addition, it has been demonstrated that uridine inhibits inflammation and fibrosis in bleomycin lung injury, decreasing collagen production. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of CPBMF65 on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and on carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in mice. After incubation with CPBMF65, decreased cell proliferation and phenotype reversion were observed in vitro. In addition, CPBMF65 promoted a protective effect on tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in mice, demonstrated by its antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory actions. The results of the present study indicate that the UPP1 inhibitor (CPBMF65) may have potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a rare disease but its prevalence throughout the globe continues to grow, primarily due to increased contact lens usage. Since early-stage symptoms associated with AK closely resemble those from other corneal infections, accurate diagnosis is difficult and this often results in delayed treatment and exacerbation of the disease, which can lead to permanent visual impairment. Accordingly, developing a rapid Acanthamoeba-specific diagnostic method is highly desired. In the present study, a rapid and differential method for AK diagnosis was developed using the secretory proteins derived from the pathogenic Acanthamoeba. Among the vast quantities of proteins secreted by the pathogenic Acanthamoeba, an open reading frame of the inosine-uridine preferring nucleoside hydrolase (IPNH) gene was obtained. After expressing and purifying the IPNH protein using the pGEX 4T-3 vector system, mice were immunized with the purified proteins for polyclonal antibody generation. Western blot was performed using protein lysates of the human corneal cell, non-pathogenic amoeba, pathogenic amoeba, and clinical amoeba isolate along with lysates from other causes of keratitis such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Fusarium solani to confirm Acanthamoeba-specificity. Western blot using the polyclonal IPNH antibody revealed that IPNH was Acanthamoeba-specific since these proteins were only observed in lysates of Acanthamoeba origin or its culture media. Our findings indicate that the IPNH antibody of Acanthamoeba may serve as a potential agent for rapid and differential AK diagnosis.",

We further define the genotype and phenotype with a focus on treatment. METHODS: Retrospective case series of 20 patients. RESULTS: Our study confirms CAD deficiency as a progressive EIEE with recurrent status epilepticus, loss of skills, and dyserythropoietic anemia. We further refine the phenotype by reporting a movement disorder as a frequent feature, and add that milder courses with isolated developmental delay/intellectual disability can occur as well as onset with neonatal seizures. With no biomarker available, the diagnosis relies on genetic testing and functional validation in patient-derived fibroblasts. Underlying pathogenic variants are often rated as variants of unknown significance, which could lead to underrecognition of this treatable disorder. Supplementation with uridine, uridine monophosphate, or uridine triacetate in ten patients was safe and led to significant clinical improvement in most patients. CONCLUSION: We advise a trial with uridine (monophosphate) in all patients with developmental delay/intellectual disability, epilepsy, and anemia; all patients with status epilepticus; and all patients with neonatal seizures until (genetically) proven otherwise or proven unsuccessful after 6 months. CAD deficiency might represent a condition for genetic newborn screening.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Premature birth is a major problem that results in an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. The management of such infants consists of supraphysiological oxygen therapy, which affects brain development due, in part, to the deterioration caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed previously that exogenously administered uridine provides neuroprotection in a neonatal rat model of hyperoxic brain injury. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of uridine on ROS in the same setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperoxic brain injury was induced by subjecting a total of 53 six-day-old rat pups to 80% oxygen (the hyperoxia group) for a period of 48 h. The pups in the normoxia group continued breathing room air (21% oxygen). Normoxia + saline or hyperoxia + saline or hyperoxia + uridine 100 mg/kg or hyperoxia + uridine 300 mg/kg or hyperoxia + uridine 500 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) 15 min prior to the hyperoxia procedure. The pups were decapitated and the brains were homogenized to analyze superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and malondialdehyde (MDA) enzymes as well as DJ-1 (protein deglycase DJ-1) — an oxidative stress-sensitive protein. RESULTS: Hyperoxia-induced may cause overproduction of oxygen radicals and the oxidant/antioxidant balance may be disturbed in the brain. Brain MPO and MDA levels were significantly increased in saline-receiving pups exposed to hyperoxia. Brain SOD and GSH-Px levels were significantly decreased in saline-receiving pups exposed to hyperoxia. Our results showed that uridine administration prevented the hyperoxia-induced decrease in SOD and GSH-Px while counteracting the hyperoxia-induced increase in MPO and MDA in a dose-dependent manner. Uridine also increased the DJ-1 levels in brains of rat pups subjected to hyperoxia. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that uridine exhibits antioxidative properties which may mediate the protective effects of uridine in a neonatal rat model of hyperoxic brain injury.",

This condition is difficult to diagnose given the large size of CAD with over 1000 missense variants and the nonspecific clinical presentation. We aimed to develop a reliable and discerning assay to assess the pathogenicity of CAD variants and to select affected individuals that might benefit from uridine therapy. METHODS: Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated a human CAD-knockout cell line that requires uridine supplements for survival. Transient transfection of the knockout cells with recombinant CAD restores growth in absence of uridine. This system determines missense variants that inactivate CAD and do not rescue the growth phenotype. RESULTS: We identified 25 individuals with biallelic variants in CAD and a phenotype consistent with a CAD deficit. We used the CAD-knockout complementation assay to test a total of 34 variants, identifying 16 as deleterious for CAD activity. Combination of these pathogenic variants confirmed 11 subjects with a CAD deficit, for whom we describe the clinical phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: We designed a cell-based assay to test the pathogenicity of CAD variants, identifying 11 CAD-deficient individuals who could benefit from uridine therapy.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent type of tumor among primary liver tumors and is the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Current therapies are controversial, and more research is needed to identify effective treatments. A new synthetic compound, potassium 5-cyano-4-methyl-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-2-olate (CPBMF65), is a potent inhibitor of the human uridine phosphorylase-1 (hUP1) enzyme, which controls the cell concentration of uridine (Urd). Urd is a natural pyrimidine nucleoside involved in cellular processes, such as RNA synthesis. In addition, it is considered a promising biochemical modulator, as it may reduce the toxicity caused by chemotherapeutics without impairing its anti-tumor activity. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of CPBMF65 on the proliferation of the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). Cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, senescence, autophagy, intracellular Urd levels, cell cycle arrest, and drug resistance were analyzed. Results demonstrate that, after incubation with CPBMF65, HepG2 cell proliferation decreased, mainly through cell cycle arrest and senescence, increasing the levels of intracellular Urd and maintaining cell proliferation reduced during chronic treatment. In conclusion, results show, for the first time, the ability of a hUP1 inhibitor (CPBMF65) to reduce HepG2 cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and senescence.",

      "abstract": "Ethanol is the most frequently psychoactive substance used in the world, leading to major public health problems with several millions of deaths attributed to alcohol consumption each year. Metabolism of ethanol occurs mainly in the liver via the predominant oxidative metabolism pathway involving phase I enzymes including alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and catalase. In a lesser extent, an alternative non-oxidative pathway also contributes to the metabolism of ethanol, which involves the uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulfotransferase (SULT) phase II enzymes. Using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, ethylglucuronide (EtG) and ethylsulfate (EtS) produced respectively by UGT and SULT conjugation and detected in various biological samples are direct markers of alcohol consumption. We report herein the efficient non-oxidative metabolic pathway of ethanol in human differentiated HepaRG cells compared to primary human hepatocytes (HH). We showed dose- and time-dependent production of EtS and EtG after ethanol (25 or 50 mM) treatment in culture media of differentiated HepaRG cells and HH and a significant induction of CYP2E1 mRNA expression upon acute ethanol exposure in HepaRG cells. These differentiated hepatoma cells thus represent a suitable in vitro human liver cell model to explore ethanol metabolism and more particularly EtG and EtS production. In addition, using recombinant HepG2 cells expressing different UGT1A genes, we found that UGT1A9 was the major UGT involved in ethanol glucuronidation.",

The effects of mertansine on uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activities in human liver microsomes and its effects on the mRNA expression of cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and UGTs in human hepatocytes were evaluated to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Mertansine potently inhibited UGT1A1-catalyzed SN-38 glucuronidation, UGT1A3-catalyzed chenodeoxycholic acid 24-acyl-β-glucuronidation, and UGT1A4-catalyzed trifluoperazine N-β-d-glucuronidation, with Ki values of 13.5 µM, 4.3 µM, and 21.2 µM, respectively, but no inhibition of UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 enzyme activities was observed in human liver microsomes. A 48 h treatment of mertansine (1.25-2500 nM) in human hepatocytes resulted in the dose-dependent suppression of mRNA levels of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1, and UGT1A9, with IC50 values of 93.7 109.1, 36.8 18.3, 160.6 167.4, 32.1 14.9, 578.4 452.0, 539.5 233.4, 856.7 781.9, and 54.1 29.1 nM, respectively, and decreased the activities of CYP1A2-mediated phenacetin O-deethylase, CYP2B6-mediated bupropion hydroxylase, and CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1-hydroxylase. These in vitro DDI potentials of mertansine with CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9/19, CYP3A4, UGT1A1, and UGT1A9 substrates suggest that it is necessary to carefully characterize the DDI potentials of ADC candidates with mertansine as a payload in the clinic."

      "abstract": "Resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug 5'-azacytidine (5'-AZA) is a major obstacle in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The uridine-cytidine kinase 1 (UCK1) has an established role in activating 5'-AZA and its protein level is significantly downregulated in patients resistant to the drug. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for the reduced UCK1 expression remains to be elucidated. Methods: Using mass spectrometry and molecular biochemistry analyses, we identified specific enzymes mediating UCK1 degradation. Human AML cell lines and murine AML model were used to characterize the effects of these enzymes on 5'-AZA resistance. Results: We demonstrated that the ubiquitin E3 ligase KLHL2 interacted with UCK1 and mediated its polyubiquitination at the K81 residue and degradation. We showed that deubiquitinase USP28 antagonized KLHL2-mediated polyubiquitylation of UCK1. We also provided evidence that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of USP28 resulted in its disassociation from KLHL2 and UCK1 destabilization. Conversely, UCK1 phosphorylation by 5'-AZA-activated ATM enhanced the KLHL2-UCK1 complex formation. Importantly, silencing KLHL2 or USP28 overexpression not only inhibited AML cell proliferation but also sensitized AML cells to 5'-AZA-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. These results were no longer observed in USP28-deficient cells. Conclusions: Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which the KLHL2/USP28/ATM axis mediates resistance of AML cells to 5'-AZA by regulating UCK1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation. These results have direct clinical implications and provide a rationale for the combination drug treatment of AML patients.",

      "abstract": "Chronic administration of efavirenz is associated with decreased serum bilirubin levels, probably through induction of UGT1A1 We assessed the impact of efavirenz monotherapy and UGT1A1 phenotypes on total, conjugated, and unconjugated serum bilirubin levels in healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers were enrolled into a clinical study designed to address efavirenz pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, and pharmacogenetics. Volunteers received multiple oral doses (600 mg/day for 17 days) of efavirenz. Serum bilirubin levels were obtained at study entry and 1 week after completion of the study. DNA genotyping was performed for UGT1A1 [*80 (C>T), *6 (G>A), *28 (TA7), *36 (TA5), and *37 (TA8)] and for SLCO1B1 [*5 (521T>C) and *1b (388A>G] variants. Diplotype predicted phenotypes were classified as normal, intermediate, and slow metabolizers. Compared with bilirubin levels at screening, treatment with efavirenz significantly reduced total, conjugated, and unconjugated bilirubin. After stratification by UGT1A1 phenotypes, there was a significant decrease in total bilirubin among all phenotypes, conjugated bilirubin among intermediate metabolizers, and unconjugated bilirubin among normal and intermediate metabolizers. The data also show that UGT1A1 genotype predicts serum bilirubin levels at baseline, but this relationship is lost after efavirenz treatment. SLCO1B1 genotypes did not predict bilirubin levels at baseline or after efavirenz treatment. Our data suggest that efavirenz may alter bilirubin disposition mainly through induction of UGT1A1 metabolism and efflux through multidrug resistance-associated protein 2. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Efavirenz likely alters the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs, potentially causing lack of efficacy or increased adverse effects, as well as the disposition of endogenous compounds relevant in homeostasis through upregulation of UGT1A1 and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2. Measurement of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin during new drug development may provide mechanistic understanding regarding enzyme and transporters modulated by the new drug.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously treated with fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, monoclonal antibodies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, and monoclonal antibodies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor. A dose reduction from 160 mg to 120 mg regorafenib reduces regorafenib-associated adverse events (AEs). Dose adjustment of irinotecan in a 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) regimen on the basis of an individual uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) genotype provides optimal oncological outcomes with acceptable AEs. The aim of this study is to address the efficacy and safety of a dose-adjusted combination of regorafenib and FOLFIRI for patients with mCRC. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, randomized in a 2:1 ratio, controlled, clinical trial with two parallel arms will be conducted to compare irinotecan dose-escalated FOLFIRI according to UGT1A1 genotyping plus 120 mg regorafenib with 120 mg regorafenib alone in previously treated patients with mCRC. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, and the secondary endpoints are overall survival, disease control rate, time to progression, and duration of treatment. Safety assessments will also be recorded. DISCUSSION: Dose adjustment for regorafenib and irinotecan makes treatment-related AEs tolerable and makes the concomitant treatment practicable. This study will provide initial evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of a new combination of chemotherapy and a targeted agent for mCRC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03880877.

In UGT1A1 homozygous or heterozygous patients, metabolism is delayed and the risk of developing adverse effects is increased, and therefore, dose reduction of irinotecan is considered. However, the specific dose reduction rate of irinotecan for heterozygous patients is uncertain. We studied the necessity of irinotecan dose reduction and its optimal dose in UGT1A1 heterozygous patients with lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer treated with irinotecan in the Tokushima University Hospital or Tokushima Municipal Hospital were included in this study. The dose of irinotecan was evaluated based on the relative dose intensity (RDI). The time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined as the period until treatment change, death, or progressive disease based on response evaluation criteria of solid tumors. We targeted 31 patients treated with irinotecan: 12 wild types (WT), 14 heterozygotes, and 1 complex heterozygote and 4 homozygotes. There was no significant difference in the TTF, but the mean RDI during the entire treatment period was significantly different in the wild type (79%), heterozygous (62%), and complex heterozygous and homozygous groups (46%). In addition, the proportion of patients who completed treatment without dose reduction in the WT group tended to be higher than that in the other groups. For lung cancer patients with UGT1A1 heterozygote types who start irinotecan therapy, reducing the initial dose by approximately 20% might be a safer chemotherapy without decreasing the therapeutic effect.",

In this study we highlight the potential role of UCK2 as a biomarker for selecting patients for RX-3117 treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The online genomics analysis and visualization platform, R2, developed by the Oncogenomics department at the AMC (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was used for in silico UCK2-mRNA correlation with overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients, while UCK2 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on pancreatic tumor formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded sections from independent pancreatic cancer patients. mRNA expression was also determined for SUIT-2, PANC-1 and PDAC-3. Lastly, the drug sensitivity to RX-3117 was investigated using the Sulforhodamine-B cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: The in silico data showed that a high UCK2-mRNA expression was correlated with a shorter overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, UCK2 protein expression was high in 21/25 patients, showing a significantly shorter mean. Overall Survival (8.4 versus 34.3 months, p=0.045). Sensitivity to RX-3117 varied between 0.6 and 11 μM. CONCLUSION: Pancreatic cancer cells are sensitive to pharmacologically achievable RX-3117 concentrations and UCK2 might be exploited as a biomarker for patient treatment selection.",

We had first reported that curcumin exhibits hypocholesterolemic properties by improving the apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA editing in primary rat hepatocytes. However, the role of curcumin in the regulation of apoB mRNA editing is not clear. Thus, we investigated the effect of curcumin on the expression of multiple editing components of apoB mRNA cytidine deamination to uridine (C-to-U) editosome. Our results demonstrated that treatment with 50 µM curcumin markedly increased the amount of edited apoB mRNA in primary mouse hepatocytes from 5.13%-8.05% to 27.63%-35.61%, and significantly elevated the levels of the core components apoB editing catalytic polypeptide-1 (APOBEC-1), apobec-1 complementation factor (ACF), and RNA-binding-motif-protein-47 (RBM47), as well as suppressed the level of the inhibitory component glycine-arginine-tyrosine-rich RNA binding protein. Moreover, the increased apoB RNA editing by 50 µM curcumin was significantly reduced by siRNA-mediated APOBEC-1, ACF, and RBM47 knockdown. These findings suggest that curcumin modulates apoB mRNA editing by coordinating the multiple editing components of the editosome in primary hepatocytes. Our data provided evidence for curcumin to be used therapeutically to prevent atherosclerosis."

Although effective vaccines are available on the market, they are recommended only in endemic areas. Despite many attempts, there are still no specific antiviral therapies for TBEV treatment. Previously, we synthesized a series of uridine derivatives of 2-deoxy sugars and proved that some compounds show antiviral activity against viruses from the Flaviviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families targeting the late steps of the N-glycosylation process, affecting the maturation of viral proteins. In this study, we evaluated a series of uridine derivatives of 2-deoxy sugars for their antiviral properties against two strains of the tick-borne encephalitis virus; the highly virulent TBEV strain Hypr and the less virulent strain Neudoerfl. Four compounds (2, 4, 10, and 11) showed significant anti-TBEV activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.4 to 10.2 µM and low cytotoxicity. The obtained results indicate that glycosylation inhibitors, which may interact with glycosylated membrane TBEV E and prM proteins, might be promising candidates for future antiviral therapies against TBEV.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that sleep plays an important role in cognitive functions and sleep deprivation impairs learning and memory. Uridine is the main pyrimidine nucleoside found in human blood circulation and has beneficial effects on cognitive functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of uridine administration on learning and memory impairment in sleep-deprived rats. Flower pot method was used to induce REM sleep deprivation. Uridine-treated groups received 1 mmol/kg uridine and control groups received 1 ml/kg saline (0.9% NaCl) twice a day for four days and once a day on the 5th day intraperitoneally. Learning and memory performances were measured using Morris water maze (MWM) test. We also measured the ratios of total calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase II (tCaMKII)/β-tubulin and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (pCREB)/β-tubulin, long-term potentiation (LTP) related molecules, using western blot analysis on the hippocampus. The results showed that REM sleep deprivation impaired learning and memory and also decreased the ratios of tCaMKII and pCREB. Uridine treatment enhanced learning and memory parameters in REM sleep-deprived rats. Additionally, decreases in tCaMKII and pCREB were prevented by uridine treatment. These data suggest that administration of uridine for five consecutive days prevents REM sleep deprivation-induced deficits in learning and memory associated with enhanced tCaMKII and pCREB ratios in the hippocampus.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (Uck2) has been demonstrated to activate antitumor prodrugs and regulate chemosensitivity in cancer cells. However, the expression and function of Uck2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. In this study, we were the first to systematically elucidate the role of Uck2 in HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Uck2 gene expression was queried between normal liver tissues and HCC in a web-based data mining platform (www.oncomine.org). Uck2 gene expression in tissue microarray was determined by immunohistochemical staining. The clinical and prognostic significance of Uck2 expression was statistically analyzed. Stable cell lines with increased Uck2 expression were established using lentivirus-based vectors, and RNAi technology was used to transiently downregulate Uck2 expression. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by using wound-healing and transwell assays, respectively. mRNA and protein expression levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: We report the upregulation of Uck2 expression in HCC tissues. We explored the relationship between Uck2 levels and the clinicopathological features of HCC patients. High Uck2 notably correlated with early recurrence and poor prognosis in HCC patients. Uck2 expression in HCC cell lines regulated the cell migration and invasion capacities in vitro. The stable overexpression of Uck2 in Bel-7402 cells promoted their metastasis ability in vivo. Furthermore, the Uck2 upregulation increased the MMP2/9 expression and activated the Stat3 signaling pathway. In addition, WP1066, a Stat3 inhibitor, neutralized the effects of Uck2 on the MMP2/9 expression and the migration and invasion capacities of HCC cells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Uck2 promotes HCC cell migration and invasion via the Stat3 signaling pathway and might be a novel potential target in HCC therapy."

      "abstract": "Uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (Up4A), biosynthesized by activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2, was initially identified as a potent endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor in perfused rat kidney. Subsequently, the effect of Up4A on vascular tone regulation was intensively investigated in arteries isolated from different vascular beds in rodents including rat pulmonary arteries, aortas, mesenteric and renal arteries as well as mouse aortas, in which Up4A produces vascular contraction. In contrast, Up4A produces vascular relaxation in porcine coronary small arteries and rat aortas. Intravenous infusion of Up4A into conscious rats or mice decreases blood pressure, and intravenous bolus injection of Up4A into anesthetized mice increases coronary blood flow, indicating an overall vasodilator influence in vivo. Although Up4A is the first dinucleotide described that contains both purine and pyrimidine moieties, its cardiovascular effects are exerted mainly through activation of purinergic receptors. These effects not only encompass regulation of vascular tone, but also endothelial angiogenesis, smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, and vascular calcification. Furthermore, this review discusses a potential role for Up4A in cardiovascular pathophysiology, as plasma levels of Up4A are elevated in juvenile hypertensive patients and Up4A-mediated vascular purinergic signaling changes in cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Better understanding the vascular effect of the novel dinucleotide Up4A and the purinergic signaling mechanisms mediating its effects will enhance its potential as target for treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Apoptosis is a series of molecular signalling regulating normal cellular growth and development. Cells resistance to apoptosis, however, leads to uncontrolled proliferation. Research involving cancer cell death is one of the most important targeted areas in the discovery of novel anticancer therapy. There are several biochemical pathways that are liked towards cancer cell death of which, uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) was recently linked to cell apoptosis induction. UCK2 is responsible for the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their corresponding monophosphate in a salvage pathway of pyrimidine nucleotides biosynthesis. Cytotoxic ribonucleoside analogues that target UCK2 enzyme activity are currently being investigated in clinical trials useful for cancer treatment. Whilst findings have clearly shown that these antimetabolites inhibit cancer development in clinical settings, they have yet to establish linking cytotoxic nucleoside analogues to cancer cell death. In this present review, we propose the probable molecular crosstalk involving UCK2 protein and cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest and triggering of apoptosis involving proteins, MDM2 and the subsequent activation of p53.",

Moreover, depletion of U34-enzymes resensitizes resistant melanoma to targeted therapy. These results indicate that targeting U34-enzymes represents a new therapeutic opportunity for melanoma patients."
