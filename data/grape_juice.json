      "abstract": "This study assesses the impact of grape juice-based alginate or chitosan edible coatings, followed by UVC treatment, on the preservation of post-harvest quality of Red Globe grapes. Coated grapes were stored at 5 °C for 28 days, and their physical, chemical, microbiological, and sensory properties were assessed during the storage period. Films were prepared with grape juice using alginate and chitosan and exposed to 32.4 J/m2 UVC irradiation, then characterized for thickness, color, puncture resistance, elongation at break, permeability, and water solubility. Alginate films were more resistant, soluble, and permeable than chitosan films. Coated and/or UVC-treated grapes showed reduced weight loss, minimal color changes, pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, and decreased microbial count compared to uncoated grapes. Sensory attributes remained stable for seven days, while control grapes' firmness significantly decreased (p < 0.05). This sustainable approach enhances the preservation of Red Globe, appealing to consumers who prefer natural preservatives.",

Wistar rats were distributed into five groups: control; PH (MCT 60mg/kg i.p.); PH+GJ (GJ-7 µL/g / day, gavage for 14 days); PH+TH (T3, 2μg/100g/day, and T4, 8μg/100g/day, by gavage for 14 days); and PH+TH+GJ. Echocardiographic, morphometric measurements and expression of proteins associated with apoptosis and inflammation were evaluated. The reduced cardiac output (35%) in PH was attenuated in the PH+GJ, PH+TH, and PH+TH+GJ groups (P<0.05). Both GJ and TH had no effect on the PH-induced hypertrophy index. The PH + TH group showed reduced BAX (~90%) and increased Bcl2 levels (~80%) as compared to PH group (P<0.05). The PH-induced increase in caspase 3 was diminished (~92%) in the PH+TH (P<0.05). Both GJ and TH, isolated and combined, reduced caspase 9 levels (~70%). PH-provoked elevated NLRP3 levels was decreased (~90%) in PH+TH (P<0.05). The therapeutic approach showed cardioprotective effects in the PH model which may be mediated by mitigation of apoptosis and inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Pulsed light (PL) pasteurization is being explored as a substitute for the conventional thermal pasteurization of juices in recent times due to better retention of nutrients and overall quality. However, the long-term stability of the PL-pasteurized juice must be investigated to promote its application by the industry. The effect of PL treatment (effective fluence of 1.15 J·cm-2) and thermal treatment (90°C for 60 s) on microbial quality, enzyme activity, bioactive compounds, sensory acceptance, and color profile of table grape juice during storage at 4 and 25°C was investigated in this study. The PL pasteurization enhanced the microbial shelf-life of the juice (<6 log10cfu·mL-1) from 5 to 35 days at 4°C. The PL and thermally-pasteurized juice demonstrated a shelf-life of only 10 days when stored at 25°C. The total soluble solids and titratable acidity did not alter significantly throughout the storage period. The peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and pectin methylesterase activities were below 10% for the PL and thermally-treated beverage when stored at 4°C. The sensory acceptability of the PL-pasteurized juice after 35 days of refrigerated storage (6.9 ± 0.3) was close to the untreated juice (7.2 ± 0.3) and greater than thermally-treated juice (6.2 ± 0.2). After the 35th day of storage at 4°C, PL-treated grape juice retained 55%, 12%, and 15.3% more phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity, respectively, than the thermally-pasteurized juice. Hence, PL pasteurization can effectively prolong the shelf-life of table grape juice while achieving microbial and enzymatic stability, along with high sensory and nutritional appeal. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Exploring non-thermal methods like pulsed light (PL) pasteurization as a substitute for conventional thermal methods is gaining recognition for its ability to retain nutrients and improve overall juice quality. However, the industry's adoption depends on understanding the shelf-stability of PL-pasteurized juice. This study specifically investigates the practical applications of PL treatment in comparison with conventional thermal treatment in enhancing microbial safety and enzymatic stability in table grape juice. The findings contribute insights into optimizing the shelf life of table grape juice and preserving its quality, supported by microbial, enzymatic, and sensory evaluations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse remodeling of lung vessels elevates pulmonary pressure and provokes pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH results in increased right ventricle (RV) afterload, causing ventricular hypertrophy and the onset of heart failure. There is no specific treatment for maladaptive RV remodeling secondary to PAH. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore two therapeutic approaches, grape juice (GJ) and thyroid hormones (TH), on PAH-induced oxidative stress and cardiac functional changes. METHODS: Parameters of echocardiography related to lung vessel resistance (AT/ET ratio), RV contractility (TAPSE), and RV diastolic function (E/A peaks ratio) were evaluated. Also, total ROS, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes, calcium handling proteins, pro-oxidant and antioxidant protein expression were measured. Values of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Both GJ and TH treatments demonstrated reductions in pulmonary resistance (~22%) and improvements in TAPSE (inotropism ~11%) and AT/ET ratio (~26%) (p<0.05). There were no changes amongst groups regarding the E/A peak ratio. Although ROS and TBARS were not statistically significant, GJ and TH treatments decreased xanthine oxidase (~49%) levels and normalized HSP70 and calcium handling protein expression (p<0.05). However, only TH treatment ameliorated diastolic function (~50%) and augmented NRF2 immunocontent (~48%) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study stands as a pioneer in showing that TH administered together with GJ promoted functional and biochemical improvements in a PAH model. Moreover, our data suggest that GJ and TH treatments were cardioprotective, combined or not, and exhibited their beneficial effects by modulating oxidative stress and calcium-handling proteins.",

      "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are typical conditions of chronic low-intensity systemic inflammatory responses, and both have become more common in recent decades, which emphasizes the necessity for healthier diet intake. Fruits such as grapes are rich in anthocyanins, one of which is delphinidin, a promising chemopreventive agent with anti-inflammatory properties. Considering that polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) are rapidly mobilized to tissues when the inflammatory process is initiated, this study aimed to understand the impact of grape juice intake and delphinidin on the migration properties of PMNs. Overweight women ingested 500 mL of grape juice for 28 days, and then lipid and inflammatory profiles, as well as the white blood cell count (WBC), were evaluated. Additionally, the gene expression of inflammatory markers and quantified migration molecules such as CD11/CD18, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were evaluated in PMNs. The influence of delphinidin-3-O-glucoside in vitro on some migration properties was also evaluated. Grape juice intake did not influence the lipid profile or affect the WBC. However, NFκB gene expression was reduced in PMNs, also reducing the circulating values of IL-8, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1. The in vitro results demonstrated that delphinidin significantly reduced the migration potential of cells and reduced CD11-/CD18-positive cells, the gene expression of ICAM-1, and the phosphorylation and gene expression of NFκB. Additionally, delphinidin also reduced the production of IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2. Grape juice, after 28 days of intervention, influenced some properties related to cell migration, and delphinidin in vitro can modify the cell migration properties.",

      "abstract": "Yan 73 (Vitis vinifera) is a dyed grape variety cultivated in China. Currently, most studies have focused on the mechanism of anthocyanins or the impact of anthocyanins as auxiliary color varieties on wine color. There is little research on its direct use or direct processing of products such as juice. In order to investigate the effects of different processing methods on the juice of Yan 73 grapes, the physicochemical and functional properties, as well as the sensory indexes of the juice, were analyzed by using thermal pasteurization (TP), thermosonication (TS), TS combined with nisin (TSN), TS combined with ε-Polylysine (TSε), irradiation (IR), and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). The physicochemical indexes, functional properties, and sensory indexes of Smoke 73 grape juice were determined and analyzed. The results of the study showed that among the seven sterilization methods, total polyphenol content (TPC) in juice was significantly increased in all treatments except HHP. TPC was the highest in TP (3773.33 mg GAE/L). Total anthocyanin content (TAC) was increased except IR5, and TSN (1202.67 mg/L) had the highest TAC. In terms of color, TP (a* = 36.57, b* = 19.70, L* = 14.81, C* = 41.55, h° = 28.30, ΔE = 5.9) promotes the dissolution of anthocyanins because of high temperatures, which basically improves all the color indicators of grape juice and makes the color of grape juice more vivid. After HHP treatment, the color (ΔE = 1.72) and aroma indicators are closer to the grape juice itself. The Entropy weight-TOPSIS, CRITIC-Topsis, and PCA integrated quality evaluation models showed that all selected TP as the best integrated quality."

Grape juice (GJ) diluted to 16 °Brix with a water activity (aw) of 0.980 was prepared from a concentrated GJ and used in this study. Results indicated a 92% growth inhibition of B. cinerea when exposed to 1 mg/mL of P1G10 and 250 MPa/4 min of pressure treatment. The proximate composition and antioxidant compounds present in the GJ were not significantly affected after the treatments. Eight phenolic compounds and two flavonoids in GJ were identified and quantified, with values fluctuating between 12.77 ± 0.51 and 240.40 ± 20.9 mg/L in the control sample (0.1 MPa). The phenolic compounds showed a significant decrease after the applied treatments, with the HHP sample having a content of 65.4 ± 6.9 mg GAE/100 mL GJ. In conclusion, a synergistic effect at moderate HHP of 250 MPa/4 min with the addition of P1G10 was observed, and the successful development of a stable and acceptable GJ product was possible."

Our objective was to investigate ultrasound treatment of black grape juice affects its bioactive components due to using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) optimization. At the same time, mineral components, sugar components, organic acids, and volatile aroma profiles were compared in black grape juice treated with thermal and ultrasound pasteurization. ANN showed superior predictive values (>99%) to RSM. Optimal combinations were obtained at 40 °C, 12 min, and 65% amplitude for thermosonication. Under these conditions, phenolic, flavonoid, antioxidant activity, and anthocyanin values were 822.80 mg GAE/L, 97.50 mg CE/L, 24.51 mmol Trolox/L, and 368, 81 mg of mv-3-glu/L, respectively. Thermosonicated grape juice (TT-BGJ) was tested against black grape juice (P-BGJ) produced with conventional thermal methods. This study investigated the effects of thermal pasteurization and thermosonication on black grape juice bioactive compounds and minerals, aroma profile, and sensory evaluation. Thermosonication affected the aroma profile less, 329.98 μg/kg (P-BGJ) and 495.31 μg/kg (TT-BGJ). TT-BGJ was detected to contain seven different mineral elements (Mn, K, Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn, and Na). Thermosonication caused an increase in Fe, Zn, Mn, and K minerals. Panelists generally liked the TT-BGJ sample. These results suggest that the thermosonication process may potentially replace the traditional black grape juice processing thermal process."

Vitis vinifera L. (grape) juice is well known for its health-promoting properties, due to its numerous bioactive compounds among which are polyphenols. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of a red grape juice extract (RGJe) against the endothelial damage induced by BPA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an in vitro model of endothelial dysfunction. Our results showed that RGJe treatment counteracted BPA-induced cell death and apoptosis in HUVECs, blocking caspase 3 and modulating p53, Bax, and Bcl-2. Moreover, RGJe demonstrated antioxidant properties in abiotic tests and in vitro, where it reduced BPA-induced reactive oxygen species as well as restored mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA integrity, and nitric oxide levels. Furthermore, RGJe reduced the increase of chemokines (IL-8, IL-1β, and MCP-1) and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin), caused by BPA exposure, involved in the primary phase of atheromatous plaque formation. Overall, our results suggest that RGJe prevents BPA-induced vascular damage modulating specific intracellular mechanisms, along with protecting cells, owing to its antioxidant capability."

For this purpose, two PEF treatments were applied: first to grapes for polyphenol enrichment of the juice, and subsequently for microbial decontamination of the obtained juice. Juice obtained from PEF-treated grapes (5 kV/cm, 63.4 kJ/kg) had the polyphenol content 1.5-fold higher and colour intensity two times higher of control juices by spectrophotometric measurement (p ≤ 0.05). A subsequent decontamination treatment by PEF (17.5 kV/cm and 173.6 kJ/kg) achieved inactivation of the present microbiota (yeasts, moulds, and vegetative mesophilic bacteria) below detection level (<30 CFU/mL). Furthermore, PEF-treated juices were microbiologically stable up to 45 days, even at abusive refrigeration storage temperatures (10 °C). PEF juice quality and sensory characteristics were similar to a fresh juice; they were neither affected by the PEF decontamination treatment, nor by storage time and temperature. Results obtained in this study demonstrate the considerable potential of PEF for the production of a polyphenol-enriched and microbially stabilized red grape juice as a unique and sustainable alternative for the juice industry, while avoiding enzymatic and heat treatments."

      "abstract": "Grapes and their derivatives have antioxidant and cardioprotective properties. Therefore, we hypothesized that grape juice (GJ) could improve vascular oxidative damage caused by chlorine radicals (OCl-), which are excessively produced in vascular tissue during cardiovascular diseases (mainly diabetes and hypertension). The antioxidant capacity of GJ was analyzed by an electrochemical method, followed by administration in rats (100 or 300 mg/kg/d, via the oral) for seven days. Then, rats were sacrificed, and their aortas were isolated and subjected to isometric recordings or immuno-histochemical analyses with or without exposure to OCl- (5, 20, or 100 μM, 60 min). Concentration-effect curves for acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were derived to analyze endothelium-dependent or independent vasore-laxation. The GJ presented with high antioxidant capacity, and treatment with GJ did not alter vascular relaxation induced by ACh or SNP. After exposure to OCl-, endothelium-denuded arteries showed preserved relaxation with SNP, whereas endothelium-intact arteries showed reduced relaxation with ACh. OCl- at various concentrations induced significantly decreased relaxation of arteries (80.6±4.2%, 55.4±4.7%, and 28.1±5.9%, respectively) vs. control arteries (96.8±2.4%). However, treatment with GJ prevented loss in relaxation caused by 5 and 20 μM OCl- and improved relaxation after exposure to 100 μM OCl-. Exposure to OCl- induced increased nitrotyrosine immunostaining of endothelial cell layers, which was improved by GJ treatment. Altogether, vascular damage caused by OCl- was prevented by treatment with GJ, and GJ prevented nitrosative stress in these vessels."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few randomized clinical trials have explored the health effects of bilberries in humans. The aim was to test the effect of bilberry and red grape-juice consumption on visual memory, motor speed and dexterity as well as inflammatory and tissue damage biomarkers of plasma in aged men with subjective memory impairment. METHODS: Nine-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, dietary intervention study of aged men (n = 60, age ≥ 67 years) with subjective memory impairment randomized to consume a 50/50 mix of bilberry/red grape-juice or an iso-caloric placebo juice. A selection of Cambridge Cognition Test Battery (CANTAB), Grooved Pegboard tests and blood-sampling for biomarker analysis were performed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Compared to placebo the selected memory and motor test scores were un-affected by the bilberry/red grape intervention. However, the plasma levels of tissue damage biomarkers decreased significantly more in the bilberry/red grape group. In particular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) decreased from 362 U/L (median, baseline) to 346 U/L (median, post intervention) in the bilberry/red grape group. Also, several biomarkers of inflammation (EGF, IL6, IL9, IL10 and TNFα) decreased significantly more in the bilberry/red grape group. Furthermore, several plasma polyphenols; p-coumaric acid, hippuric acid, protocatechuic acid, 3HPAA and vanillic acid, increased significantly more in the bilberry/red grape group compared to placebo with the largest increase in p-coumaric acid with 116%; from 2.2 [1.0,5.5] to 4.7 [2.8,8.1] μM/L (median [95% CL]). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a nine-week bilberry/red grape juice intervention has no measurable effects on the selected memory scores in aged men experiencing memory problems but decreases the level of biomarkers of inflammation and tissue damage. Whether the dampening effects on inflammation and tissue damage biomarkers have relevance for neuroinflammatory brain pathology remains to be established.

Two commercially available activated carbons (PS1300 and CASPF) were evaluated at 1, 2, and 4 g/L with juice from smoke-affected Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes. PS1300 and CASPF treatments removed up to 75 and 92% of the phenolic glycosides in the smoke-affected Pinot Noir rosé juice, respectively, and both carbons removed virtually all (i.e., 98-99%) of the phenolic glycosides in the smoke-affected Chardonnay juice at the highest dose rate (4 g/L). The free volatile phenols in the wines were similarly lower in concentration following treatment. Sensory analysis confirmed that the wines made from carbon fined juice had reduced smoke aroma and flavor compared to those from the nontreated controls. However, desirable sensory properties such as color and fruity attributes were also negatively affected by the treatment. The dose rate should be optimized in industry practice to find a balance between reducing the intensity of smoke-related sensory attributes while maintaining or enhancing positive attributes.",

      "abstract": "High-pressure processing (HPP) has emerged over the last 2 decades as a good alternative to traditional thermal treatment for food safety and shelf-life extension, supplying foods with similar characteristics to those of fresh products. Currently, HPP has also been proposed as a useful tool to reduce food contaminants, such as pesticides and mycotoxins. The aim of the present study is to explore the effect of HPP technology at 600 MPa during 5 min at room temperature on alternariol (AOH) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) mycotoxins reduction in different juice models. The effect of HPP has also been compared with a thermal treatment performed at 90 °C during 21 s. For this, different juice models, orange juice/milk beverage, strawberry juice/milk beverage and grape juice, were prepared and spiked individually with AOH and AFB1 at a concentration of 100 µg/L. After HPP and thermal treatments, mycotoxins were extracted from treated samples and controls by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and determined by HPLC-MS/MS-IT. The results obtained revealed reduction percentages up to 24% for AFB1 and 37% for AOH. Comparing between different juice models, significant differences were observed for AFB1 residues in orange juice/milk versus strawberry juice/milk beverages after HPP treatment. Moreover, HPP resulted as more effective than thermal treatment, being an effective tool to incorporate to food industry in order to reach mycotoxins reductions.",

This study was planned to assess the effect of a white grape (Vitis vinifera) juice extract (WGJe) in diet-induced obese zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish were divided into four different diet groups: (i) normally fed (NF); (ii) overfed (OF); (iii) WGJe-supplemented NF (5 mL/L in fish water); (iv) WGJe-supplemented OF. Body mass index (BMI) was extrapolated each week. After the fourth week, euthanized zebrafish were processed for both microscopic evaluations and gene expression analyses. OF zebrafish showed higher BMI values with respect to NF counterparts, an effect that was hindered by WGJe treatment. Moreover, histological analyses showed that the area of the adipose tissue, as well as the number, size, and density of adipocytes was significantly higher in OF fish. On the other hand, WGJe was able to avoid these outcomes both at the subcutaneous and visceral levels, albeit to different extents. At the gene level, WGJe restored the altered levels of ghrelin and leptin of OF fish both in gut and brain. Overall, our results support the anti-obesity property of WGJe, suggesting its potential role in weight management.",

Importantly, the imbalance of oxidative stress is related to PD physiopathology and progression. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of grape juice consumption associated with an aquatic exercise protocol on oxidative stress parameters and cognitive function in individuals with PD. The participants were randomized into two groups: grape juice group (GJG) and control group (CG) and were submitted to 4 weeks of an aquatic intervention (twice a week, approximately 60 minutes/session). The GJG also consumed 400 ml of grape juice per day (integral and conventional) during this period. Cognitive function was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa) questionnaire. For the analysis of oxidative stress markers, specifically lipid oxidative damage (TBARS), proteins (Carbonil), acid uric and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase), blood collection were done before and after intervention. No changes were observed in cognitive function after intervention in both groups. Regarding biomarkers, a reduction of antioxidant enzymes, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and uric acid was observed in both groups. However, only the GJG showed a significant reduction on protein oxidation levels after intervention. In conclusion, the consumption of grape juice associated with an aquatic exercise protocol might be consider an effective alternative to reduce the oxidative damage in PD, reinforcing the importance of this intervention in promoting beneficial impact in this population."

Later, samples were dehydrated by forced convection at 40, 50, and 60 °C. Enriched samples were subjected to in vitro digestion. The total polyphenols, monomeric polyphenols, and antioxidant activities were determined from recovered extracts. Results showed that total polyphenols present in higher concentrations in the gastric phase, 271.85 ± 7.64 mg GAE/100 g d.m. Monomeric polyphenols' behavior during in vitro digestion for the VI/OH 50 °C and dried treatment (60 °C) was descending, mainly in quercetin, which decreased by 49.38% concerning the initial concentration, before digestion. The cyanin, catechin, epicatechin, and epigallocatechin decreased by 26.66%, 20.71%, 23.38%, and 21.73%, respectively. Therefore, based on obtained results, the IV/OH 50 °C treatment (dried 60 °C) is the best combination to incorporate polyphenols from grape juice."

Then, the influence of bioactive nutritional compounds and physical training on these biomarkers has been studied, although the combination of both strategies has been not investigated. Therefore, our aim was to verify the effect of the association of physical training with red grape juice (Vitis labrusca) consumption on global histone acetylation H3 and H4 levels, oxidative stress markers and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in peripheral blood of healthy elderly women. This double-blind randomized clinical study consisted of 29 volunteers, aged 59 years and over, divided into three groups: grape juice group (GJG, n = 9); placebo and exercise group (PLEG, n = 10) and grape juice and exercise group (GJEG, n = 10). During 1 month, GJG consumed 400 ml of grape juice per day (integral and conventional), while the PLEG and GJEG groups, besides consuming juice or placebo were submitted to a concurrent physical training protocol (two times per week, 60 min / session). The volunteers were submitted to blood collections before and after the intervention for the biomarkers analysis, e.g. IL-6, histone acetylation H3 and H4, lipid oxidative damage (TBARS), proteins (Carbonyl), non-enzymatic antioxidant defense (Sulfhydryl groups) and activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase). There were no statistically significant differences in the global levels of histone acetylation H3 and H4 post intervention compared to the basal period as well and between groups were found. However, PLEG and GJEG showed a remarkable reduction on IL-6 levels after intervention. We also observed an increase in Carbonyl levels, SOD activities and Sulfhydryl levels comparing before and after intervention. Considering the interaction of time and groups, a significant increase in Sulfhydryl levels only in GJG was found. The physical training protocol associated or not with grape juice consumption showed anti-inflammatory effects and an influence in the antioxidant defenses (non enzymatic and enzymatic) in elderly women. However in grape juice group, without exercise, we observed an increase in non enzymatic antioxidant defense, what could be attributed to the polyphenols content. These responses seem not to be involved with histone acetylation status.",

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a multifactorial hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is partly responsible for both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality levels worldwide. It has been recently discovered that sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is reduced in the circulation and in an in vitro model of PE. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of trans-resveratrol, a potent antioxidant and activator of SIRT1, on oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) production in an in vitro model of PE compared to gestational hypertensive (GH) and healthy pregnant (HP) women. Furthermore, we also evaluated the effects of an acute intake of grape juice on women with PE to assess whether it could mimic in vitro trans-resveratrol supplementation. (1) In the GH group, resveratrol decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased their antioxidant capacity, while inhibiting SIRT1 reestablished previous levels. (2) In PE, inhibition of SIRT1 increased antioxidant activity. (3) Intracellular NO and supernatant nitrite levels were increased by inhibiting SIRT1 in the PE group. (4) Grape juice intake increased intracellular NO levels versus before grape juice intake control; however, the inhibition of SIRT1 before grape juice intake initially increased NO, but decreased it 1 h after grape juice intake. In conclusion, activating SIRT1 by using resveratrol alone may not be beneficial to women with PE, and GH and PE seem to have different responsive mechanisms to this molecule. Furthermore, grape juice intake seems to have different effects compared to resveratrol supplementation alone in this in vitro model of PE, demonstrating the potential of the combination of other biologically active molecules from grape juice over the SIRT1-eNOS-NO in PE treatment.",

METHODS: Nineteen participants were randomized to Aquatic Exercise (AQ, n = 9) and Aquatic Exercise + Grape Juice (AQ+GJ, n = 10) groups and performed to 4 weeks of an aquatic intervention (twice a week, approximately 60 min/session). The AQ+GJ groups also consumed 400 mL of grape juice per day during this period. Functional capacity (six-min walk test, 6MWT), mobility (The Timed Up and Go, TUG) and the risk of falls (Berg Balance Scale, BBS) were evaluated before and after intervention. In addition, blood collections were carried out for biomarker analysis (e.g. BDNF and global histone H4). RESULTS: The aquatic exercise program induced functional improvement in individuals with Parkinson's disease, specifically ameliorating their mobility and functional capacity. In addition, enhanced levels of BDNF and histone H4 acetylation were found after the intervention. Grape juice consumption did not potentiate these effects, since any significant differences between the AQ and AQ+GJ groups were not found in all analysed variables. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides important insights about aquatic exercise-modulated BDNF levels in individuals with Parkinson's disease in combination with functional improvements, suggesting that histone acetylation status may interact to dictate the molecular mechanisms involved in this response.

      "abstract": "Verjuice is one of the alternative fruit juices recently obtained from unripe grapes. In this study, the aim was primarily to optimize the process conditions for the enrichment of bioactive components in verjuice vinegar with ultrasound treatment. For this purpose, ultrasound treatment was applied to vinegar samples at different times (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min), different amplitudes (60%, 65%, 70%, 75% and 80%) and 26 kHz frequency. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total antioxidant capacity (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) were evaluated for optimization (response surface methodology (RSM) and genetic algorithm (GA)) of process conditions. The sensory properties, microbiological quality and anticarcinogenic activity were then evaluated for the ultrasound-treated verjuice vinegar (UVV) (9.4 min and 68.7 amplitude result of RSM), traditional verjuice vinegar and pasteurized verjuice vinegar samples obtained from the optimization. At the end of the RSM optimization, CUPRAC (464.44 mg TEAC/mL), DPPH (0.694 mg TEAC/mL), TFC (70.85 mg CE/mL) and TPC (12.22 mg GAE/mL) were determined. RSM and GA results were found to be approximately the same. Analysis results showed that ultrasound-treated verjuice vinegar was enriched bioactive components compared to other samples. Verjuice vinegar showed anticarcinogenic effects. The UVV sample was generally appreciated in sensory evaluation. As a result, ultrasound treatment of verjuice vinegar was found to be successful."

In this study, the impact of pasteurization and high-power ultrasound treatment on the quality of red grape juice was investigated in terms of the content of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds and l-ascorbic acid as well as regarding the microbiological and physicochemical properties. The grape juice was subjected to pasteurization (80 °C, 2 min) as well as to ultrasound treatment with an amplitude of 50 and 70% for 5 and 10 min. The results indicated the same level of total phenolic content for pasteurized and sonicated samples for 10 min with an amplitude of 70%, while the highest level of l-ascorbic acid was recorded for sonicated samples with an amplitude of 70% for 10 min. pH of sonicated samples decreased with amplitude and treatment time while total soluble solids and titratable acidity increased with amplitude and time. Moreover, the results indicated the usefulness of juice sonication to enhance the inactivation of microorganisms. Thus, the high-power ultrasound treatment might represent a viable technique to replace the conventional thermal treatment in grape juice processing.",

Positive results were found when PEP-N31 was used to extract phenolic compounds after the grapes had been blanched for 3 min and macerated for 1 h. The resulting juice had better yield, color characteristics and higher phenolic content (1637.21 mg.L-1, as gallic acid equivalent, or GAE) than the conventionally prepared juice (1422.59 mg GAE.L-1), and it was very similar to the juice obtained through the treatment with a commercial enzyme (1682.10 mg GAE.L-1). The concentration of methanol in the juice produced with the PEP-N31 was less than 200 mg.L-1. These results encourage the use of PEP produced by Thermomucor indicae-seudaticae-N31 by the grape-processing industry."

Six-week-old db/db mice were fed on an AIN-93G diet or a diet containing 1% freeze-dried LSM or HSC grape juice for 7 weeks. Treatment with LSM grape juice significantly decreased hepatic triglycerides, serum aspartate transaminase activities, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance values, whereas HSC juice did not significantly influence these parameters. The LSM grape juice showed higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities than HSC juice. The benefits of LSM grape juice are probably due to a much higher proanthocyanidin content than that of HSC juice. These results suggest that LSM grape juice can exert hepatoprotective effects in db/db mice, partly through improving insulin resistance and promoting antioxidant and inflammatory activities."

However, only one previous trial has evaluated the effects of a Mediterranean diet intervention in a US sample population. METHODS: To address this gap, we conducted a pilot, non-blinded, 8-week randomized controlled trial on the comparative efficacy of consumption of a Mediterranean diet or a diet supplemented with fish oil, walnuts, and grape juice versus controls. Participants (overweight or obese US adults; 73% female and mean age 51 years) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) Mediterranean diet; (2) habitual high-fat American-type diet supplemented with fish oil, walnuts, and grape juice; or (3) habitual high-fat American-type diet (controls). Intent-to-treat analysis of within-subject differences (Student's paired t-test or Wilcoxon sign ranks test) and between-subject differences (mixed-effects models with a group-by-time interaction term, adjusted for baseline health outcome) was conducted. RESULTS: Participants in the Mediterranean diet arm (n = 11) had significantly greater weight loss despite no significant change in total caloric intake, and lower plasma cystine, indicative of decreased oxidative stress, compared to controls (n = 9) at both 4 and 8 weeks. Compared to controls, they also had significantly lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at 4 weeks. Participants in the supplement arm (n = 10) had significantly lower adiponectin levels compared to controls at 4 weeks. No significant improvements in endothelial function or inflammatory biomarkers were observed in either intervention group compared to controls. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that adopting a dietary pattern reflecting a Mediterranean diet improves weight and cardio-metabolic health among overweight or obese US adults, and may be more beneficial than supplementing habitual American diets with fish oil, walnuts, and grape juice."

Studies on the effects of purple grape juice supplementation have already been conducted; however, there are no data on the effects of the consumption of white grape juice (WGJ) to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of WGJ supplementation on body mass index, waist and abdominal circumference, blood pressure and glucose, insulin, oxidative damage, and lipid profile in women. METHODS: A total of 25 women, ages 50 to 67 y, were included in this study. The volunteers were instructed to consume 7 mL/Kg/d of WGJ (Vitis labrusca) without other changes in diet energy consumption or habitual lifestyle. The supplementation occurred over 30 d. Anthropometric data and blood samples were collected before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Supplementation with WGJ reduced the women's body mass index and waist and abdominal circumference (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in blood pressure before and after the consumption of WGJ. In addition, no changes in blood glucose, insulin, and levels of oxidative damage were found. Women who supplemented with WGJ showed an increase of 16% in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the consumption of WGJ can improve metabolic parameters in women, which may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.",

This paper evaluates the potential chemopreventive and anticancer properties of phenolic compounds present in grape juice extracts (GJE) from Autumn Royal and Ribier varieties. The effects of these GJE on viability (SRB day assay) and metastatic potential (migration and invasion parameters) of colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and SW-480 were evaluated. The effects of GJE on two matrix metalloproteinase gene expressions (MMP2 and MMP9) were also evaluated via qRT-PCR. In the former, GJE reduced cell viability in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. GJE treatment also reduced cell migration and invasion. Moreover, MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression diminished depending on extract and on cell type. Conclusions. These results provide novel information concerning anticancer properties of selected GJE by revealing selective cytotoxicity and the ability to reduce invasiveness of colon cancer cells."

METHODS: This double-blind, randomized controlled study was performed with 26 individuals with hypertension (40 to 59 years old) who were divided into experimental (n = 14) and control (n = 12) groups. Subsequently, the experimental group was subdivided according to the initial BP values. The subjects performed 2 sessions of aerobic exercise on a treadmill (60 minutes, 60%-85% maximum heart rate), separated by a 28-day period of supplementation with a daily dose of juice (150 ml for men and 100 ml for women) or a control drink. BP was measured before, during, and immediately after each exercise session as well as every 10 minutes during the 60-minute post-exercise recovery period. RESULTS: The BP at rest did not change in the experimental group, but when this group was subdivided by initial BP, the subjects with controlled initial BP (EGCP) achieved a significant reduction (133.3 ± 5.6 to 114.6 ± 12.2 mmHg, p = 0.02); in contrast, the experimental group with borderline hypertensive BP values (EGBP) did not. Intervention with juice did not modify PEH in the experimental group, but when this group was divided as a function of the initial BP, PEH was potentiated at some times in EGCP. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that juice promotes a reduction in BP at rest and is also capable of improving PEH in individuals with hypertension, but these effects are dependent on the initial BP values.",

Male Wistar rats (n = 6/per group) received an intraperitoneal Cd injection (1.2 mg/Kg) at age 80 days and GJC (2 g/Kg) by gavage from 50 days until 136 days old. Groups receiving either Cd or GJC were added. An intraperitoneal injection of saline (0.9%) and water by gavage was administered in the absence of treatment with Cd or GJC. Animals were anaesthetized and exsanguinated at 136 days; the vas deferens, left testis and epididymis were removed; and perfusion continued with fixative. The right epididymis was collected for morphological analysis. Cd had a devastating effect demonstrated by reduced sperm count in testes and epididymis, sperm production and normal sperm count, besides increased epididymis sperm transit time and completely disorganized morphology. These alterations were attributed to higher Cd levels in the testes and a lipid peroxidation (LP) process. Consumption of GJC plus Cd intoxication was effective, reducing metal accumulation and LP. Consequently, we could identify a preserved sperm profile, with improvement in testis and epididymis sperm count, normal sperm structure and sperm transit time. Moreover, GJC extends its protective effect to the epididymis, allowing complete re-establishment of its morphology, ensuring successful sperm maturation process. In conclusion, our study indicates long-term GJC as a promising therapy against reproductive chemical intoxication injury damage, preserving sperm prior to ejaculation.",

Previous intervention studies of Concord grape juice have demonstrated improvement to memory and driving ability following 3- to 4-month supplementation in middle-aged and older adults. However, no studies to date have demonstrated acute cognitive benefits of grape juice, and investigation of these effects in young adults is lacking. METHODS: This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, counterbalanced-crossover study, assessed the effects of 230 ml purple grape juice or sugar-matched control in 20 healthy young adults. Computerised measures of episodic memory, working memory, attention and mood were completed at baseline and following a 20-min absorption period. RESULTS: Purple grape juice significantly improved reaction time on a composite attention measure (p = 0.047) and increased calm ratings (p = 0.046) when compared to placebo. Order effects also indicated an enduring positive effect on pre-dose memory reaction time (p = 0.018) and post-dose calm ratings (p = 0.019) when purple grape was consumed first. CONCLUSIONS: These findings in a small sample of healthy young adults suggest that purple grape juice can acutely enhance aspects of cognition and mood. No significant effects of juice were observed on memory measures, suggesting that these may be less susceptible to manipulation following acute supplementation in healthy young adults. Potential mechanisms underlying these effects include modulation of cerebral blood flow, glucoregulation and inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity, all of which require further exploration.",

A quality-based comparison of cold plasma treatment with thermal pasteurization treatment of white grape juice was done. RESULTS: HVACP treatment of grape juice at 80 kV for 4 min resulted in a 7.4 log10 CFU mL-1 reduction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae without any significant (P > 0.05) change in pH, acidity and electrical conductivity of the juice. An increase in non-enzymatic browning was observed, but total color difference was very low and within acceptable limits. Spectrophotometric measurements showed a decrease in total phenolics, total flavonoids, DPPH free radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity, but they were found to be comparable to those resulting from thermal pasteurization. An increase in total flavonols was observed after HVACP treatments. CONCLUSION: HVACP treatment of white grape juice at 80 kV for 2 min was found to be comparable to thermal pasteurization in all analyzed quality attributes. HVACP has shown the potential to be used as an alternative to thermal treatment of white grape juice. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

RESULTS: HPP treatment of 600 MPa and TP significantly reduced aerobic bacteria, coliform and yeast/mold counts. At day 20 of storage, HPP-600 juice displayed no significant differences compared with fresh juice in terms of physicochemical properties such as titratable acidity, pH and soluble solids, and retained less than 50% PPO and POD activities. Although significant differences were observed in the color, antioxidant contents and antioxidant capacity of HPP-treated juice, the extent of these differences was substantially lower than that in TP-treated juice, indicating that HPP treatment can better retain the quality of grape juice. Sensory testing showed no significant difference between HPP-treated juice and fresh juice, while TP reduced the acceptance of grape juice. CONCLUSION: This study shows that HPP treatment maintained the overall quality parameters of white grape juice, thus effectively extending the shelf life during refrigerated storage. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.",

WGJe was also tested on the production of bacterial biofilms in vitro. Results. WGJe inhibited in vitro most Gram-positive bacteria tested, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P being the most sensitive strain (MIC values of 3.9 μg/mL). The effect was bactericidal at the concentration of 500 μg/mL. Amongst the Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the only susceptible strain (MIC and MBC of 2000 μg/mL). No effect on the growth of Candida sp. and the fungus Aspergillus niger was detected (MIC values > 2000 μg/mL). WGJe inhibited the biofilms formation of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a dose-dependent effect. Conclusions. WGJe exerted both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity in vitro. The presented results could be used to develop novel strategies for the treatment of skin infections and against potential respiratory pathogens."

However, few data from clinical trials are available on the dose-response relationship of fruit juice flavonoids to these outcomes. Utilizing the results of clinical trials testing single doses, we have analyzed data from studies of 100% Concord grape juice by placing its flavonoid content in the context of results from randomized clinical trials of other polyphenol-rich foods and beverages describing the same outcomes but covering a broader range of intake. We selected established biomarkers determined by similar methods for measuring flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and the resistance of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) to oxidation. Despite differences among the clinical trials in the treatment, subjects, and duration, correlations were observed between the dose and FMD. Inverse dose-response relationships, albeit with lower correlation coefficients, were also noted for the other outcomes. These results suggest a clear relationship between consumption of even modest serving sizes of Concord grape juice, flavonoid intake, and effects on risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This approach to dose-response relationships may prove useful for testing other individual foods and beverages.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium is a well-known testicular toxicant, and parts of the world population are exposed chronically by inhalation or by food and water intake. Grape products have been highlighted as important sources of bioactive compounds, having anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and metal chelating properties. Since maintenance of tissue morphology is essential for testicular sperm development and hence male fertility, we analysed the protective effect of grape juice concentrate (GJC) (G8000(®) ) consumption on testicular morphology in rats exposed to cadmium. Thus, four groups of male Wistar rats (n = 6 per group), 50 days old, ingested either water or G8000(®) (2 g/kg/day) until they had completed one spermatogenic cycle in adult life (136 days old). Cadmium (1.2 mg / kg) was injected intraperitoneally when the animals were 80 days old into one of the water and one of the G8000 groups; intraperitoneal saline was used as a control in the other two groups. Animals anaesthetised and exsanguinated at 136 days and then perfused with Karnovsky's fixative and then the testes were collected for morphological analysis. We describe evident disruption of testicular morphology by cadmium, with alteration in tissue component proportions, reduced Leydig cells volume and initial signs of an inflammatory process. Ultrastructural analysis showed greater damage, suggesting spermatogenesis disruption. G8000(®) ingestion allowed tissue architecture to be re-established, as was corroborated by our stereological and morphometric findings. Animals from the group where G8000(®) had been administered together with cadmium revealed a significant reduction in macrophages and blood vessel volume, suggesting diminished inflammation, when compared to animals that received only cadmium. Moreover, smaller number of ultrastructural alterations was noted, revealing fewer areas of degeneration and disorganized interstitium. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that GJC consumption prevented the spermatogenic disruption promoted by cadmium, and thus could be a promising form of therapy against male infertility.",

Cisplatin is widely used in the treatment of cancer. High doses of cisplatin have also been known to produce acute adverse effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of antioxidant properties of whole grape juice (with skin and seeds) on cisplatin-induced acute gastrointestinal tract disorders and nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats. Gastric emptying is significantly increased in whole grape juice-pretreated rats when compared to cisplatin treatment alone. The expression of ghrelin mRNA of stomach is increased in rats with whole grape juice. However, pretreatment with whole grape juice did not reduce renal function markers in acute renal toxicity. No significant changes were recorded in the oxidative stress/antioxidant status parameters of any study group. In contrast, pretreatment with whole grape juice slightly improved tubular cell vacuolization, tubular dilatation, and cast formation in renal tubules. These results show that consumption of whole grape juice induces somewhat beneficial effects in preventing cisplatin-mediated dyspepsia but does not offer protection against cisplatin-induced acute renal toxicity.",

Male Wistar rats (90-days-old) were treated once a day with conventional or organic white grape juice by gavage for 14 days (7 μL/g). On the 15th day the rats received carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in a single dose of 3.0 mL/kg. Cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were dissected to measure the activity of creatine kinase (CK) and pyruvate kinase (PK). No changes in feeding behavior were observed after the treatment with the grapes juices. However, there was an increase in grooming behavior in the open field test provoked by both juices. CCl4 inhibited CK activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the rats and CCl4 also reduced PK activity in all brain structures studied. Furthermore, both white grape juices prevented the decrease in the activity of CK and PK. Therefore, we can suggest that organic and conventional white grape juices could restore the activity of enzymes with a central role in brain energy metabolism."

Treatments were conducted with a total pectinolytic activity of 1 U/mL of fruit juice, at 40 °C, for 60 min. After the enzymatic treatment, the juices were evaluated with respect to yield, viscosity, and degree of clarification, as well as the effect of the enzymes on polyphenol concentration, anthocyanins, and juice color. The results showed that both EEB and PEC increase yield, reduce viscosity and contribute to the clarification of grape juice. After enzyme treatment with the EEB preparation, the extraction yield increased 28.02 % and decreased 50.70 % in viscosity during the maceration of the pulp. During the juice production process clarification increased 11.91 %. With PEC, higher values for these parameters: 42.36, 63.20, and 26.81 % respectively, were achieved. The addition of EEB resulted in grape juice with better color intensity and extraction of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins. Considering all comparison criteria, the enzymatic extract of K. marxianus NRRL-Y-7571 can potentially be used in the production of juice.",

      "abstract": "Radiocontrast media (RCM)-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) is a major clinical problem accounting for 12% of all hospital-acquired cases of acute kidney injury. The pathophysiology of CIN is not well understood, but direct toxic effects on renal cells have been postulated as contributing to CIN. We have investigated the effect of a white grape (Vitis vinifera) juice extract (WGJe) on human renal proximal tubular (HK-2) cells treated with the radiocontrast medium (RCM) sodium diatrizoate. WGJe caused an increase in phosphorylation of the prosurvival kinases Akt and ERK1/2 in HK-2 cells. Treatment of HK-2 cells with 75 mgI/ml sodium diatrizoate for 2.5h and then further incubation (for 27.5h) after removal of the RCM caused a drastic decrease in cell viability. However, pre-treatment with WGJe, prior to incubation with diatrizoate, dramatically improved cell viability. Analysis of key signaling molecules by Western blotting showed that diatrizoate caused a drastic decrease in phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473), FOXO1 (Thr24) and FOXO3a (Thr32) during the initial 2.5h incubation period, and WGJe pre-treatment caused a reversal of these effects. Further analysis by Western blotting of samples from HK-2 cells cultured for longer periods of time (for up to 27.5h after an initial 2.5h exposure to diatrizoate with or without WGJe pre-treatment) showed that WGJe pre-treatment caused a negative effect on phosphorylation of p38, NF-κB (Ser276) and pERK1/2 whilst having a positive effect on the phosphorylation of Akt, FOXO1/FOXO3a and maintained levels of Pim-1 kinase. WGJe may alleviate RCM toxicity through modulation of signaling molecules that are known to be involved in cell death and cell survival and its possible beneficial effects should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "Grape contains a great deal of tartaric acid and minerals such as Potassium and Calcium which during ripening of grape increase in concentrations and result in potassium and calcium tartrate precipitation in grape juice. There have been different methods introduced for de-tartration but none of them have been completely successful. These methods can be categorized into two different groups of physicochemical and instrumental methods. In this study application of cold treatment, cream of tartar (Potassium bitartrate), Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC), and Mannoprotein were investigated. Then all these samples were stored at 5 °C to stimulate tartrate crystals precipitation and were investigated for color indices change, the amount of sediments, acidity, pH and taste. Among these methods addition of Mannoprotein and CMC were proved to have ability in stabilizing tartrate crystals in red grape juice."

Purple grape juice (pGJ), a rich source of flavonoids with antioxidant properties, has been shown in adults to reduce oxidative stress and improve endothelial function. We examined the effects of supplementing meals with pGJ on microvascular endothelial function and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in 24 cancer survivors (ages 10-21 years). PROCEDURE: In a randomized controlled crossover trial consisting of two, 4 week intervention periods, each preceded by a 4 week washout period, subjects received in random order 6 ounces twice daily of pGJ and clear apple juice (cAJ; similar in calories but lower in flavonoids). Measurements were obtained before and after each supplementation period; change was evaluated using mixed effects ANOVA. RESULTS: pGJ did not improve endothelial function, measured using digital reactive hyperemia, compared with cAJ (mean change: pGJ 0.06, cAJ 0.22; difference of mean change [95% CI]: -0.16 [-0.42 - 0.11], P = 0.25). No significant changes in plasma concentrations of oxidized-LDL, myeloperoxidase, or high sensitivity C-reactive protein were observed. CONCLUSION: After 4 weeks of daily consumption of flavonoid-rich pGJ, no measurable change in vascular function was observed in these childhood cancer survivors.",

Two strains, 235 and 751, showed a significant ability to inhibit A. carbonarius both on grape berries and in in vitro experiments. Neither their filtrate nor their autoclaved filtrate culture broth was able to prevent consistently pathogen growth. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by all four selected yeasts were likely able to consistently prevent pathogen sporulation in vitro. VOCs produced by the non-fermenting strain 778 also significantly reduced A. carbonarius vegetative growth. Three yeast strains (235, 751, and 778) efficiently adsorbed artificially spiked OTA from grape juice, while autoclaving treatment improved OTA adsorption capacity by all the four tested strains. Biological control of A. carbonarius and OTA-decontamination using yeast is proposed as an approach to meet the Islamic dietary laws concerning the absence of alcohol in halal beverages.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by alternating periods of remission and active intestinal inflammation. Flavonoids exert several biological activities, which are mainly related to their ability to inhibit inflammatory process and/or to their antioxidant properties, and are able to regulate the immune response. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether phenolic compounds present in grape juice could reduce the inflammatory effects induced by experimental colitis. A total of 41 male Wistar rats were randomized into seven groups, as follows: G1--Sham group: sham induced-colitis rats; G2--(2,4,6-rinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) TNBS group: nontreated induced-colitis; G3--2% grape juice control group; G4--1% grape juice 24h after TNBS colitis induction; G5--1% grape juice on day 7 after colitis induction; G6--2% grape juice 24h after colitis induction; G7--2% grape juice on day 7 after colitis induction. Genotoxicity was evaluated by comet assay. Immunohistochemistry was determined using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method being analyzed in control (normal tissue) and \"hot spot\" areas i.e., presenting inflammatory process being graded as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong). Both parameters were evaluated in the cytoplasm of epithelial or inflammatory cells. TNF-immunoexpression and iNOS were reduced after drinking grape juice 24 h or after 7 days for all doses tested. COX-2 was reduced in the groups exposed to 1% grape juice 24 h or 7 days of exposure. The grape juice at 1% dose in the last 7 days of treatment as well as grape juice at 2% dose decreased the peripheral blood genotoxicity. Taken together, the grape juice mainly at 1% dose exerts anti-inflammatory effects in chronic colitis caused by TNBS as a result of down regulation in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduction of genotoxicity in peripheral blood cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Smoking is associated with impaired vascular function. Concord grape juice (CGJ), a rich source of flavonoids, can modify cardiovascular risk factors. Endothelial function and arterial stiffness are surrogate markers of arterial health. We examined the impact of CGJ on arterial wall properties in healthy smokers. METHODS: We studied the effect of a 2-week oral treatment with CGJ in 26 healthy smokers on 3 occasions (day 0 (baseline), day 7, and day 14) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Measurements were taken before (pSm), immediately after (Sm0), and 20 minutes after (Sm20) cigarette smoking. Endothelial function was evaluated by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured as an index of aortic stiffness. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, treatment with CGJ resulted in a significant improvement in pSm values of FMD (P = 0.02) and PWV (P = 0.04). At baseline, smoking decreased FMD in both the CGJ group (P < 0.001) and the placebo group (P < 0.001). Compared with placebo, CGJ treatment prevented the acute smoking-induced decrease in FMD on day 7 (P = 0.02) and day 14 (P < 0.001). Moreover, at baseline, smoking induced a significant elevation in PWV in both the CGJ group (P = 0.02) and the placebo group (P = 0.04). Treatment with CGJ prevented the smoking-induced elevation in PWV on day 7 (P = 0.003) and day 14 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CGJ consumption improved endothelial function and vascular elastic properties of the arterial tree in healthy smokers and attenuated acute smoking-induced impairment of arterial wall properties.",

      "abstract": "Grape (Vitis spp.) is a major source of resveratrol that can be eaten directly or after making jam, jelly, wine and juice. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) has a profound positive influence on human health, including anti-carcinogenic, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-ageing effects and the ability to lower blood sugar. During industrial production of grape juice, resveratrol is lost because of the use of clarifying agents and filtration; therefore, commercial grape juice contains very low amounts of resveratrol. In this study, we investigated the accumulation of resveratrol in grape juice prepared from three varieties of grape, viz. Campbell Early, Muscat Bailey A (MBA) and Kyoho, following post-harvest ultrasonication cleaning for 5 min and 6h of incubation in the dark at 25 °C. This process resulted in the amounts of resveratrol increasing by 1.53, 1.15 and 1.24 times in juice prepared from Campbell Early, MBA and Kyoho, respectively, without changing the amounts of total soluble solids. Overall, our results indicate that ultrasonication treatment of post-harvested grape fruits can be an effective method for producing resveratrol-enriched grape juice as well as cleaning grapes thoroughly.",

However, cardiovascular autonomic effects of polyphenols were poorly studied. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of resveratrol and grape juice treatments in hemodynamics, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) variability and cardiac redox parameters. Male Wistar rats were divided in 3 groups (n=7/each) and treated for 30 days: only L-NAME-treated (60 mg/kg/day by oral gavage), L-NAME+resveratrol (L-NAME+R) and L-NAME+grape juice (L-NAME+G). BP signal was directly recorded and pulse interval (PI) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variability were analyzed in time and frequency domains. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was determined by the alpha index. Oxidized and reduced glutathione concentrations were determined in cardiac tissue. L-NAME increased BP with no differences among groups (mean BP: L-NAME=124±4, L-NAME+R=126±3 and L-NAME+G=125±4 mmHg). PI and SAP variability expressed by total variance were also similar among groups. However, normalized low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components of PI variability were lower and higher, respectively, in both R and G-treated groups when compared to only L-NAME group. Interestingly, sympathetic modulation to the vessels (LF from SAP variability) and BRS were decreased and increased, respectively, only in L-NAME+R rats. Additionally, GSH/GSSG ratios were higher in L-NAME+R and L-NAME+G than in L-NAME group. Our results indicate that resveratrol and grape juice treatments can modulate autonomic function and promote cardiac redox benefits even when nitric oxide is decreased. Moreover, resveratrol influences not only cardiac but also vascular autonomic modulation.",

To test this hypothesis, rats were acutely treated with organic PGJ (Vitis labrusca) and subsequently submitted to an exhaustive exercise bout. Parameters of oxidative stress, such as thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) levels, 2',7',-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) oxidation, and nonprotein sulfhydryl levels (NP-SH) in the brain, skeletal muscle, and blood, were evaluated. Enzyme activity of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase, and δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) in the brain, skeletal muscle, and blood were also assayed. Statistical analysis showed that the exhaustive exercise bout increased TBARS levels and DCFH-DA oxidation, and decreased NP-SH levels in rat tissue. Ca(2+)-ATPase activity was increased in groups exposed to both exercise and PGJ treatment. The results indicate that organic PGJ intake was able to protect against the oxidative damage caused by an exhaustive exercise bout in different rat tissues.",

Results showed that NTPDase, E-NPP, 5'-nucleotidase, and ADA activities as well as platelet aggregation were increased in the diabetic/saline group compared to the control/saline group. Treatment with RW and GJ increased ectonucleotidases activities and prevented the increase in the ADA activity in the diabetic/GJ and diabetic/RW groups. Platelet aggregation was also decreased by the treatment with RW and GJ in the diabetic/GJ and diabetic/RW groups. In the in vitro tests, resveratrol, caffeic acid, and gallic acid increased ATP, ADP, and AMP hydrolysis, while quercetin and rutin decreased the hydrolysis of these nucleotides in platelets of diabetic rats. The ADA activity and platelet aggregation were reduced in platelets of diabetic rats in the presence of all polyphenols tested in vitro. These findings suggest that RW, GJ, and all polyphenols tested were able to modulate the ectoenzymes activities. Moreover, a decrease in the platelet aggregation was observed and it could contribute to the prevention of platelet abnormality, and consequently vascular complications in diabetic state.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of fruits plays an important role as a health protecting factor. Grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) are believed to have health benefits due to their antioxidant activity. Öküzgözü is the largest among the grape varieties grown in Turkey. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) causes free radical generation in many tissues such as the liver, kidney, heart, lung, testis, brain and blood. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only drug to treat primary biliary cirrhosis, but the effects remain controversial. The aim of the present study is to investigate the protective effect of Öküzgözü grape juice or UDCA against tissue damage induced by CCl₄ in rats. The amount of total phenolics and flavonoids were found to be 1208.00 +/- 43.00 μg ml⁻¹ as the gallic acid equivalent and 5.2 +/- 0.19 μg ml⁻¹ as the quercitin equivalent in Öküzgözü grape juice, respectively. In vivo administration of CCl₄ caused a significant increase of various biochemical parameters such as alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB) and a decrease in albumin (ALB) levels in serum or an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the tissues when compared to a control. Administration of CCl₄ along with Öküzgözü grape juice or ursodeoxycolic acid (UDCA) significantly reduces these changes. Histopathalogical studies also support the protective effect of the extract. This study demonstrates the protective activity of Öküzgözü grape juice and thus scientifically supports the usage of this fruit in various traditional medicines for the treatment of tissue disorders. The effect of Öküzgözü grape juice was comparable with that of UDCA.",

The effects of grape juice concentrate treatment on histopathological changes, and immunohistochemistry for p53, p16 and p21 were evaluated. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 18) were distributed into three groups: group 1: negative control; group 2: cholesterol at 1% (w/w) in their diet, treated during 5 weeks; and group 3: cholesterol at 1% in their chow during 5 weeks, and grape juice concentrate at 222 mg per day in their drinking-water in the last week only. RESULTS: The results pointed out that treatment with grape juice concentrate did not show remarkable differences regarding liver tissue in the cholesterol-exposed group when compared to group 2. However, grape juice concentrate was able to modulate p16 immunoexpression when compared to high fat diet group. p53 and p21 did not show any significant statistical differences among groups. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that subchronic grape juice concentrate administration was able to modulate cell cycle control by downregulation of p16 immunoexpression in high fat diet-induced liver steatosis in rats.",

      "abstract": "Red grapes contain elevated amounts of antioxidant compounds (polyphenols) that may potentially prevent cell aging, cardiovascular disease and oxidation-related disorders. Since functional drinks are presently one of the most dynamic sectors of the market, the present work was aimed at evaluating the possible antioxidant effect of an experimental grape juice in terms of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6-s) and total antioxidant capacity in young (20 ± 10 yr-old), middle-aged (45 ± 10 yr-old) and elderly (75 ± 10 yr-old) individuals. Grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Tempranillo) were de-stemmed, racked and pressed. The juice was subsequently stabilized by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). Participants consumed 200 mL of grape juice twice a day (as the lunch and dinner desserts) for 5 days. First-void morning urines were collected before treatment (basal values), the day immediately after the last ingestion of juice (assay), and one day afterwards (post-assay). aMT6-s and total antioxidant capacity were quantified using commercial ELISA and colorimetric assay kits, respectively. The intake of grape juice cv. Tempranillo induced a significant increase of urinary aMT6-s and total antioxidant capacity in the three groups of age analyzed as compared to their corresponding basal and post-assay values. These functional/nutraceutical properties may be of interest for a prospective commercialization of the grape juice. The novel technology used for juice stabilization may be suitable for introducing into the market a product with high sensory and nutritional quality, as it has been shown in this study.",

L* values of all pekmez samples were similar while carob Pekmez had higher L* values. Also a development of the Fuzzy Expert System (FES) was made for prediction. Using the experimental values, FES model of the system was designed. Accordance was found with experimental and FES results when compared statistically.

      "abstract": "A simple, reliable, and sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for the quantification of volatile and nonvolatile biogenic amines in Port wines and grape juices was developed and evaluated. The method was based on a previously reported two-phase derivatization procedure with isobutyl chloroformate in a toluene medium, which provides a quantitative reaction in 10 min. Following the derivatization step, the excess of reagent was eliminated by treatment with alkaline methanol. The derivatization procedure was performed directly on 1 mL of sample, avoiding any fastidious and time-consuming cleanup extraction steps. The method allows the simultaneous quantification of 22 amines, which can be found in wines: methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, butylamine, isobutylamine, amylamine, isoamylamine, 2-methylbutylamine, hexylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, 1,3-diaminopropane, putrescine, cadaverine, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2-phenylethylamine, histamine, and tyramine. Because of the fact that histamine and tyramine derivatives are degraded during the isobutyl chloroformate elimination step, the corresponding determination was made after removal of the excess of derivatizing reagent by evaporating an aliquot of the toluene layer obtained after the reaction. The presented method showed excellent analytical characteristics in what linearity, recovery, repeatability, and limit of detections were respected. It was used to assess the concentration of biogenic amines in juice grapes and Tawny and Vintage Port wines with different aging times. On the whole, the total content of amines in Port wines was low. Most of the amines found in wines have their origin in the raw material used for their elaboration, so the Port winemaking process is not prone to the production of this kind of compounds. Total biogenic amine contents have shown a decrease with the aging of both types of Port wines.",

Also, it is proved that the antioxidants from plant foods improve the body's antioxidant defence by acting additively and synergistically. As a result, rational combination of antioxidant-rich foods is recommended to population in the prevention of oxidative stress-related diseases. Both apple and grape are antioxidant-rich fruits. In this study, 2 weeks dietary intervention study was carried out in 25 healthy subjects to investigate the influences of apple and grape juices consumption on body antioxidant status. Our results indicated that 2 weeks of apple and grape juice consumption increased the plasma T-AOC and decreased the concentration of malondialdehyde. However, no change was found in the content of plasma carbonyl. Erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities were enhanced by 2 weeks of fruit juice consumption; however, no change was found in the activity of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase. The in vitro comet assay results indicated that apple and grape juice consumption did not influence lymphocyte damage upon hydrogen peroxide treatment. Urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine content was not affected by 2 weeks of fruit juice intervention. These findings indicated that concomitant intake of apple and grape juice was efficient in enhancing the body's antioxidant status.",

The main objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that consumption of dietary compounds from grapes would modify γδ T-cell function. Other factors related to immune function after grape juice consumption were also tested. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel intervention was conducted: 100% grape juice made from Concord grapes or a placebo beverage was consumed by 85 individuals daily for 9 weeks. Subjects were asked not to consume other red, blue, and purple fruits during the study. Blood samples, taken at the beginning and the end, were analyzed for γδ T-cell numbers and proliferation, vitamin C, antioxidant capacity, and the ability to protect DNA from strand breaks. Those consuming the grape juice had significantly greater numbers of circulating γδ T cells and higher serum vitamin C levels compared to the placebo by two-way repeated-measure analysis of variance (P < .05). Individuals consuming the placebo had lower serum antioxidant activity, less γδ T-cell proliferation, and increased DNA strand breaks when challenged with H(2)O(2). Analysis of the data by structural equation modeling confirmed that 61% of the variance in biological functions at 9 weeks was due to grape juice consumption. Based on conventional statistical analyses, as well as on sophisticated modeling techniques, regular consumption of purple grape juice in the absence of other red, blue, or purple fruits benefited immunity in healthy, middle-aged human subjects.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The disruption of plant cell walls during fruit juice processing results in the enzymatic formation of herbaceous-smelling green leaf volatiles (GLVs). Our objective was to assess the impact of thermal processing conditions on resulting levels of GLVs (hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, hexanol, cis-3-hexenol, and trans-2-hexenol), total phenols, monomeric anthocyanins, and percent polymeric color in Concord grape juice. The effects of fruit maturity and stage of juice processing on juice GLV content was also assessed. Of the GLVs studied, only trans-2-hexenal routinely exceeded its published sensory threshold in finished juice. We observed an inverse linear correlation between berry maturity (total soluble solids) and trans-2-hexenal levels in finished juice (P < 0.05, R(2)= 0.91). Trans-2-hexenal was at a maximum immediately following crushing (569 microg/kg, >30-fold over detection threshold [DT]), decreased to 100 microg/kg following depectinization, pressing, and pasteurization, and to 32 microg/kg following cold-stabilization. The loss of trans-2-hexenal could be explained primarily by its reduction to trans-2-hexenol, which increased from 53 microg/kg after crushing to 500 microg/kg after cold-stabilization. High temperature pretreatment of must immediately following crushing (\"hot break\") resulted in 5- to 6-fold higher concentrations of trans-2-hexenal in the final bottled juice as compared to conventional hot press. Contrary to expectations, no significant increase in phenolics and anthocyanins were observed in hot break conditions. These results indicate that hot break procedures may thermally inactivate enzymes responsible for transforming trans-2-hexenal under normal processing conditions and potentially alter the flavor qualities of the finished Concord juice. Different equivalent pasteurization regimes (82 to 93 degrees C) prior to bottling had no significant effect on GLV content of the finished Concord juices (P > 0.05). PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Introducing new processing techniques to fruit juice production can potentially result in undesirable changes to organoleptic properties. We have observed significantly higher levels of trans-2-hexenal, a potent herbaceous off-flavor, in Concord grape juice prepared with an initial high temperature heat treatment (\"hot break\"). Concord juice producers should be cautious in using hot break processing, especially with immature fruit, as it may result in persistence of green aromas in juice.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to investigate the effect of a single purple grape juice administration on cyclosporin A (CyA) oral bioavailability in healthy volunteers. DESIGN: The study followed a two-period crossover design, where the volunteers were randomly assigned to receive 200-mg CyA soft-gelatin capsules with 200 mL of either purple grape juice or water in the first day of the experiment. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Volunteers were kept at the clinical research unit during the blood sampling period and fasted from 10 p.m. until 4 hours after dosing. A washout period of 1 week was observed before the second treatment was administered. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Blood samples were taken before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after CyA dosing. All meals received during the study day were standardized. Whole blood was assayed to determined CyA concentration using the Emit 2000 Cyclosporine specific immunoassay (Dade Behring Limited, Syva Company, Dade Behring Inc. Cupertino, CA). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis from the individual whole blood concentration-time curves after each treatment using Excel 2003 software. Statistical analysis was performed using paired Student t-test (a 5 .05) with the aid of SAS software. RESULTS: Twelve healthy male volunteers were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 20.6 years (range 19 -23 years). Purple grape juice significantly decreased cyclosporine AUC by 30% and Cmax by 28%. The time to peak blood level and elimination half-life of the drug, however, were not affected. The clearance determined increased around 50%, with purple grape juice. CyA half-life was not affected, indicating that the change observed in clearance (CL/F) was probably due to a change in the absorption (bioavailability) rather than in the elimination process after administration with purple grape juice. CONCLUSION: Purple grape juice decreased AUC and Cmax, whereas half-life was not changed, suggesting that juice affects the absorption and not drug elimination. The above findings are similar to previous data on the effects on CyA pharmacokinetics caused by the ingestion of red wine. Our findings are potentially relevant in the clinic. The intake of CyA with purple grape juice should be discouraged, as drug bioavailability can be decrease by 30%, leading to blood levels below the drug therapeutic window. A free interval of at least 2 hours between CyA intake and purple juice drinking is recommended.",

DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: A cancer center in an academic health science center in the northeastern United States. SAMPLE: 77 adult patients with cancer receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy agents. METHODS: Participants drank 4 oz. of grape juice or placebo prior to meals for one week following each of four chemotherapy treatment cycles. They recorded frequency, duration, and distress of nausea, vomiting, and retching daily, beginning the evening of chemotherapy administration and continuing for seven days. Data were analyzed with generalized estimating equations methodology to model differences between groups over time. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Nausea and vomiting frequency, duration, and distress; quality of life; control over decision making; and psychological state. FINDINGS: Nausea and vomiting frequency, duration, and distress were lower for experimental group members, although a high attrition rate (50%) resulted in insufficient power to detect statistically significant differences over time. Greater levels of anxiety, depression, and hostility at baseline were related to nausea and vomiting, quality of life, and perceived control over decision making. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of grape juice flavonoids on CINV should be investigated further with a larger sample to determine whether preliminary findings are supported. Alterations to the study protocol will be necessary to decrease attrition. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Flavonoid-rich fruits and vegetables may provide additional protection against CINV. If the compounds work, they would offer a low-cost, readily available adjunctive treatment for the management of CINV.",

The glucoside was found in the juice extracts of grapes exposed to bushfire smoke, as well as grapes experimentally exposed to smoke. Compared to the control (unsmoked) juice sample, the experimentally smoked juice contained a significant amount of the glucoside, indicating glucosylation of guaiacol occurred following grapevine smoke exposure. The reference compound, and the glucoside found in the smoked juice samples were less susceptible to acid treatment but virtually disappeared after enzyme treatment with beta-glucosidase. The susceptibility of the glucoside to enzyme hydrolysis could be one reason for the release of guaiacol from smoke affected grapes during fermentation.",

Concord grape juice supplementation has been shown to reduce inflammation, blood pressure and vascular pathology in individuals with CVD, and consumption of such flavonoid-containing foods is associated with a reduced risk for dementia. In addition, preliminary animal data have indicated improvement in memory and motor function with grape juice supplementation, suggesting potential for cognitive benefit in ageing humans. In this initial investigation of neurocognitive effects, we enrolled twelve older adults with memory decline but not dementia in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with Concord grape juice supplementation for 12 weeks. We observed significant improvement in a measure of verbal learning and non-significant enhancement of verbal and spatial recall. There was no appreciable effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms and no effect on weight or waist circumference. A small increase in fasting insulin was observed for those consuming grape juice. These preliminary findings suggest that supplementation with Concord grape juice may enhance cognitive function for older adults with early memory decline and establish a basis for more comprehensive investigations to evaluate potential benefit and assess mechanisms of action.",

A full factorial experimental design with regression modeling was employed to investigate the main effects of amplitude level and treatment time on anthocyanins and color parameters. Significant effects of sonication on major anthocyanins cyanidin-3-O-glucosides (CA), malvanidin-3-O-glucosides (MA) and delphinidin-3-O-glucosides (DA), color values (L*, a*, b*) and color index (CI) were observed. Prediction models were found to be significant (p<0.05) with low standard errors and high coefficients of determination (R(2)). Model predictions for critical quality parameters of anthocyanins (CA; MA; DA), color values (L*, a*, b*), TCD and CI inactivation were closely correlated to the experimental results obtained. Significant retention of anthocyanin content in grape juice was observed for CA (97.5 %); MA (48.2 %) and DA (80.9%) during sonication. CI and other color combinations (L*a*b*, L*a*/b* and L*b*/a*) were found to be strongly correlated with anthocyanin content. This study shows that sonication could be employed for as a preservation technique for fruit juice processing where anthocyanin retention is desired.",

A significant 35% increase in hippuric acid excretion (p<0.001) in urine was measured after the MIX consumption compared with placebo, whereas no change was found after GJX consumption. GC-MS-based metabolomics of urine allowed identification of 18 different phenolic acids, which were significantly elevated following intake of either extract. Syringic acid, 3- and 4-hydroxyhippuric acid and 4-hydroxymandelic acid were the strongest urinary markers for both extracts. MIX and GJX consumption had a slightly different effect on the excreted phenolic acid profile and on endogenous metabolite excretion, possibly reflecting their different polyphenol composition.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the protection of organic and conventional purple grape juices in brain, liver, and plasma from adult Wistar rats (7 months old) against the oxidative damage provoked by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). Adult rats were divided into three groups (control, conventional purple grape juice, and organic purple grape juice). Half of the rats received CCl(4), and the other half received the vehicle (vegetable oil). The chemical analytical determination showed that the highest levels of total phenolic, resveratrol, and catechins were seen in organic purple grape juices. Considering the treatment groups, it was observed that in all tissues (brain structures and liver) and plasma, CCl(4) treatment increased the lipid peroxidation (LP) levels. Both grape juices were capable to reduce LP levels in cerebral cortex and hippocampus; however, in the striatum and substantia nigra only the organic grape juice reduced LP level. CCl(4) caused an increase in catalase activity in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra and in superoxide dismutase activity in substantia nigra. This increase was reduced by both juices in substantia nigra and hippocampus structures (P < .05). In the alkaline version of the comet assay performed on whole blood, it was observed that CCl(4) was capable of inducing mainly DNA damage class 4 and 3 frequencies, which was significantly reduced in groups that received both purple grape juices. This implies that both grape juices have an important antigenotoxic activity.",

Effects of processing variables on grape juice color values (L, a and b) and anthocyanins were determined. The changes in lightness (L) values and total color difference (TCD) values were fitted well to zero-order kinetics whereas, a and b followed first-order kinetics. Three major anthocyanins were observed in the grape juice namely cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (Cy3Gl, 133.9 mg/L), delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (Dy3Gl, 21.4) and malvidin-3-O-glucoside (My3Gl, 3.2mg/L). Significant reductions in anthocyanin content were observed during ozonation. During ozonation Cy3Gl was found to be stable compared to Dy3Gl and My3Gl. Changes in Cy3Gl were fitted well to the fraction conversion model. The results presented in this study indicate that both color and anthocyanin content are significantly affected during ozone processing. Thus, the effects of ozonation on the grape juice should be considered by processors prior to its adoption as a preservation technique.",

An experimental design based on response surface methodology (RSM) was used and results were also compared with those of a factorially designed experiment. The relationship between the levels of inactivation of microorganisms and the energy applied to the grape juice was analysed. Yeast and bacteria were inactivated by the PEF treatments, with reductions that ranged from 2.24 to 3.94 log units. All PEF parameters affected microbial inactivation. Optimal inactivation of the mixture of spoilage microorganisms was predicted by the RSM models at 35.0 kV cm(-1) with 303 Hz pulse width for 1 ms. Inactivation was greater for yeasts than for bacteria, as was predicted by the RSM. The maximum efficacy of the PEF treatment for inactivation of microorganisms in grape juice was observed around 1500 MJ L(-1) for all the microorganisms investigated. The RSM could be used in the fruit juice industry to optimise the inactivation of spoilage microorganisms by PEF.",

OBJECTIVE: To study the acute effects of grape juice consumption on appetite, mood and implicit memory during a time of increased lethargy - the post-lunch dip. DESIGN: Thirty-five participants with a mean age of 26 years who smoked a mean of 11 cigarettes/day for 8 years were included in the study. It included a practice session and two treatment sessions. All sessions involved consumption of grape juice or an energy-matched placebo with lunch followed by assessments of mood, implicit memory, appetite and food intake. RESULTS: Mood decreased over time for both treatments, but there were no differences after lunch between grape juice and placebo for any measure. CONCLUSION: This study did not document any acute effects of grape juice consumption on mood, implicit memory, appetite or food intake in smokers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among hemodialysis patients; it has been attributed to increased oxidative stress, dyslipidemia, malnutrition, and chronic inflammation. Activation of neutrophils is a well-recognized feature in dialysis patients, and superoxide-anion production by neutrophil NADPH oxidase may contribute significantly to oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of dietary supplementation with concentrated red grape juice (RGJ), a source of polyphenols, and vitamin E on neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and other cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients. DESIGN: Thirty-two patients undergoing hemodialysis were recruited and randomly assigned to groups to receive dietary supplementation with RGJ, vitamin E, or both or a control condition without supplementation or placebo. Blood was obtained at baseline and on days 7 and 14 of treatment. RESULTS: RGJ consumption but not vitamin E consumption reduced plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B and increased those of HDL cholesterol. Both RGJ and vitamin E reduced plasma concentrations of oxidized LDL and ex vivo neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity. These effects were intensified when the supplements were used in combination; in that case, reductions in the inflammatory biomarkers intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 also were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Regular ingestion of concentrated RGJ by hemodialysis patients reduces neutrophil NADPH-oxidase activity and plasma concentrations of oxidized LDL and inflammatory biomarkers to a greater extent than does that of vitamin E. This effect of RGJ consumption may favor a reduction in cardiovascular risk.",

      "abstract": "It is generally assumed that polyphenols, such as anthocyanins in fruit juice, exist in a free soluble state and are readily available for absorption in the gastro-intestinal tract. In the present study, we have investigated the interaction of polyphenols with soluble carbohydrate polymers, such as pectin and lipid nanovesicles, that are generated during homogenization of the fruit tissue during juice extraction. A commercially available grape juice concentrate contained nearly 25% of polyphenol fraction bound to macromolecules that were nondialyzable. Treatment of dialyzed juice with cellulase, pectinase, and beta-galactosidase did not cause the release of bound polyphenols; however, treatment with triton X-100 caused an increased release of bound polyphenols. The dialyzate contained relatively more -3-O glucosides and -3-O-acetoyl glucosides in comparison to the bound fraction which was enriched in -3-O-coumaroyl glucosides, suggesting qualitative differences in the bound and the free anthocyanin composition. Electron microscopic analysis of the juice fractions revealed the presence of electron-dense nanovesicle-fiber complexes ranging from 10 to 200 nm in diameter. Such complexes were absent in the dialyzate fraction. Cellulase treatment did not change the morphology of the complexes; however, treatment with pectinase and beta-galactosidase disrupted the complexes, releasing vesicular structures, suggestive of the pectin nature of the fibrous matrix. The dialyzed and the dialyzate fractions also showed differences in their 1H NMR and fluorescence spectral characteristics. The dialyzed fraction containing polyphenol-pectin complexes showed no superoxide scavenging capacity, reduced hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and high 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, indicating potential changes in functionality because of the complex formation.",

      "abstract": "The heat resistance of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes that were in stationary phase, had been exposed to high osmotic pressure, or were acid adapted was evaluated in white grape juice concentrate (58 degrees Brix, pH 3.3). The most heat-resistant cells of all three pathogens were those exposed to high osmotic pressure or in stationary phase. Unlike in single-strength juices, in concentrate the acid-adapted cells for all three pathogens were less heat resistant than were cells in the other physiological states. E. coli O157:H7 had the highest heat resistance for all temperatures tested (e.g., D62 degrees C = 1.8 +/- 0.3 min, with a z-value of 9.9 +/- 0.6 degrees C). L. monocytogenes exposed to high osmotic pressure had the highest z-value (12.3 +/- 1.2 degrees C), although its D-values for all temperatures tested were lower (e.g., D62 degrees C = 0.93 +/- 0.1 min) than those for E. coli O157:H7. Salmonella was the most sensitive of the pathogens under all conditions. Based on the results obtained in this study, one example of a heat treatment that will inactivate 5 log units of all three pathogens in white grape juice concentrate was calculated as 1.5 min at 71.1 degrees C (z = 10.3 degrees C). Validation studies confirmed the predicted D71 degrees C for E. coli O157:H7 exposed to high osmotic pressure.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Recent anecdotal, unvalidated case reports have suggested potentiation of warfarin-induced anticoagulation by cranberry juice, possibly through inhibition of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, the enzyme responsible for the clearance of the active S-enantiomer of warfarin. To address this question, the effect of cranberry juice and other beverages on CYP2C9 activity was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The effects of 4 beverages on CYP2C9 activity were studied in human liver microsomes, by use of flurbiprofen hydroxylation as the index reaction. In a clinical study 14 healthy volunteers received 100 mg flurbiprofen on 5 occasions in a crossover fashion, with at least 1 week separating the 5 trials. Flurbiprofen was preceded in random sequence by the following: (1) cranberry juice placebo (8 oz), (2) cranberry juice (8 oz), (3) brewed tea (8 oz), (4) grape juice (8 oz), and (5) fluconazole, a CYP2C9 inhibitor serving as a positive control, with 8 oz of water. RESULTS: Flubiprofen hydroxylation in vitro was reduced to 11% +/- 8% of control by 2.5% (vol/vol) brewed tea, to 10% +/- 7% of control by grape juice, to 56% +/- 16% of control by cranberry juice, to 85% +/- 5% of control by cranberry juice placebo, and to 21% +/- 6% of control by the index inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.5 micromol/L) (P <.01 for all comparisons versus control). Flurbiprofen clearance (29-33 mL/min) and elimination half-life (3.3-3.4 hours) did not differ significantly among trials 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, clearance in the fluconazole treatment condition (trial 5) was significantly reduced compared with the placebo control (17 +/- 5 mL/min versus 31 +/- 8 mL/min, P <.05), and the half-life was prolonged (5.3 +/- 1.6 hours versus 3.3 +/- 0.8 hours, P <.05). Formation of 4-hydroxyflurbiprofen was correspondingly reduced by fluconazole (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although grape juice and tea impaired CYP2C9 activity in vitro, none of the 3 beverages altered CYP2C9-mediated clearance of flurbiprofen in humans, making a pharmacokinetic interaction with warfarin highly unlikely.",

      "abstract": "Grape contains flavonoids with antioxidant properties which are believed to be protective against various types of cancer. This antioxidative protection is possibly provided by the effective scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus defending cellular DNA from oxidative damage and potential mutations. This study of healthy adults tested whether a daily regimen of grape juice supplementation could reduce cellular DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes and reduce the amount of free radicals released. Sixty-seven healthy volunteers (16 women and 51 men) aged 19-57 years were given 480 ml of grape juice daily for 8 weeks in addition to their normal diet, and blood samples were drawn before and after the intervention. The DNA damage was determined by using the single cell gel (comet) assay with alkaline electrophoresis and was quantified by measuring tail length (TL). Levels of free radicals were determined by reading the lucigenin-perborate ROS generating source, using the Ultra-Weak Chemiluminescence Analyzer System. Grape juice consumption resulted in a significant decrease in lymphocyte DNA damage expressed by TL (before supplementation: 88.75 +/- 1.55 microm versus after supplementation: 70.25 +/- 1.31 microm; P=0.000 by paired t-test). Additionally, grape juice consumption for 8 weeks reduced the ROS/photon count by 15%, compared to the beginning of the study. The preventive effect of grape juice against DNA damage was simultaneously shown in both sexes. These results indicate that the consumption of grape juice may increase plasma antioxidant capacity, resulting in reduced DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes achieved at least partially by a reduced release of ROS. Our findings support the hypothesis that polyphenolic compounds contained in grape juice exert cancer-protective effects on lymphocytes, limiting oxidative DNA damage possibly via a decrease in free radical levels.",

The methods tested included dealcoholization, dry mineralization, and wet mineralization with heating by using different acids and/or mixtures of acids. The sensitivity, detection limit, accuracy, precision, and selectiviy of each method were established. Such research is necessary because of the better analytical indexes obtained after acid digestion of the sample, as recommended by the European Union, which advocates the direct method. In addition, although high-temperature mineralization with an HNO3-HCIO4 mixture gave the best analytical results, mineralization with nitric acid at 80 degrees C for 15 min gave the most satisfactory results in all cases, including those for wines with high levels of sugar and beverages with high alcoholic content. The results for table wines subjected to the latter treatment had an accuracy of 98.70-99.90%, a relative standard deviation of 2.46%, a detection limit of 19.0 microg/L, and a determination limit of 31.7 microg/L. The method was found to be sufficiently sensitive and selective. It was applied to the determination of Ca in grape juice, different types of wines, and beverages with high alcoholic content, all of which are produced and widely consumed in Spain. The values obtained for Ca were 90.00 +/- 20.40 mg/L in the grape juices, 82.30 +/- 23.80 mg/L in the white wines, 85.00 +/- 30.25 mg/L in the sweet wines, 84.92 +/- 23.11 mg/L in the red wines, 85.75 +/- 27.65 mg/L in the rosé wines, 9.51 +/- 6.65 mg/L in the brandies, 11.53 +/- 6.55 mg/L in the gin, 7.3 +/- 6.32 mg/L in the pacharán, and 8.41 +/- 4.85 mg/L in the anisettes.

The mutagenic response was evident in the absence of an activation system and inclusion of such a system did not influence mutagenicity. The grape juice-mediated mutagenic response was not due to histidine residues in the juice or likely treatment with sulfite. Moreover, freshly prepared grape juice displayed a similar mutagenic response. Three different brands of commercially available white grape juice were investigated in the Ames test; they all provoked a clear positive mutagenic response, but the degree of mutagenicity differed and could not be attributed to differences in the content of solids.
