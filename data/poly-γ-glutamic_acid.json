      "abstract": "Slow transit constipation (STC) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder caused by colon dysfunction. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), an anionic polymer known for its moisture retention, degradability, and food safety, was studied for its effects on loperamide-induced STC in mice. Treatment with γ-PGA for one week significantly increased both defecation frequency and fecal water content, with the high-dose group (10 g/kg/d) restoring fecal water content to 34.23%, outperforming the low- (16.16%) and medium-dose (27.08%) groups and exceeding the positive control, PEG, by 1.35 times. γ-PGA enhanced intestinal peristalsis and reduced the expression of inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, caspase-1, TLR2) and water-electrolyte transport genes (AQP3, AQP4, ENaC-β), while improving the expression of tight junction proteins (Claudin-1, Occludin, ZO-1) damaged by loperamide. Histopathological analyses confirmed γ-PGA's capacity to repair intestinal damage. Additionally, Western Blot analysis indicated reduced AQP3/4 levels in the colon, and molecular docking showed good binding affinity between γ-PGA and AQPs. γ-PGA also positively altered gut microbiota composition. Overall, γ-PGA shows promise in treating STC by modulating aquaporins and gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "A novel Bacillus subtilis HB-31 strain was isolated from Gotjawal Wetland in Jeju Island, Republic of Korea. A mucus substance produced by this strain was identified as high-molecular-weight poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) using NMR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and size-exclusion chromatography/multi-angle light scattering analyses. We evaluated whether γ-PGA strengthened the skin barrier using keratinocytes and a reconstructed skin model. In keratinocytes, γ-PGA treatment dose-dependently increased the mRNA expression of skin barrier markers, including filaggrin, involucrin, loricrin, serine palmitoyl transferase, fatty acid synthase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. γ-PGA also enhanced hyaluronic acid synthesis by upregulating hyaluronic acid synthase-1, -2, and -3 mRNA levels and promoted aquaporin 3 expression, which is involved in skin hydration. In the reconstructed skin model, topical application of 1% γ-PGA elevated filaggrin, involucrin, CD44, and aquaporin 3 expression, compared to the control. These results suggest that the newly isolated HB-31 can be used as a commercial production system of high-molecular-weight γ-PGA, which can serve as an effective ingredient for strengthening the skin barrier and improving moisture retention. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of γ-PGA on skin health and its application in treating skin conditions.",

      "abstract": "The accumulation of chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) in soil during industrialization and modernization poses an extreme threat to crops. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) has the potential to stabilize heavy metals in soil through chelation because of the numerous carboxyl groups in its side chain. The rhizosphere microbiome contributes to plant detoxification by participating in heavy metal passivation. However, it is still unclear whether γ-PGA can alleviate the toxicity of Cr and Cu to plants and whether this effect is associated with changes in the rhizosphere microbiome assembly. Here, we found that γ-PGA application significantly reduced the content of Cr or Cu in cucumber plants by 67.45%-86.77% and 94.67%-98.21, respectively, and alleviated the oxidative stress of Cr or Cu to plants. Moreover, γ-PGA significantly increased the biomass of cucumber fruits in the plot experiment by 13.5% and 25.3% under Cr and Cu stress, respectively. The content of Cr or Cu in the cucumber fruit was below limits of detection, in contrast to the 31.23 mg/kg Cr or 9.86 mg/kg Cu detected in the no-γ-PGA treatment. γ-PGA effectively chelated Cr and Cu in vitro, and less than 30% of their chelates were degraded in 20 weeks, suggesting the strong stability of these chelates. γ-PGA significantly altered the rhizosphere bacterial community composition of cucumber by enriching phyla Gemmatimonadota, Acidobacteriota and Firmicutes, and genera Gemmatimonas and Stenotrophomonas, which potentially involved in reducing the mobility of Cr and Cu in soils. Furthermore, γ-PGA significantly enriched taxa assigned to plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). Together, our results suggest that γ-PGA can reduce the Cr and Cu contents in cucumber, and this process is strongly associated with the chelation capacity of γ-PGA and its effects on rhizosphere microbiome composition. These results highlight the exciting potential to use γ-PGA for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils.",

This study determined the effects of γ-PGA on coastal saline soil by analyzing soil aggregate, soil evaporation, soil vertical water and salt distribution, and soil cation content, soil pH, soil nutrient content and soil microorganism quantity. Results showed that γ-PGA had an ameliorative effect on saline soil, with the PGAB treatment exhibiting the most pronounced ameliorative effect compared to CK. Adding PGAB reduced soil evaporation by 30.45 %, soil salt content by 27.91 %, meanwhile increasing plant height by 33.86 %, plant fresh weight by 98.54 %, soil aggregate diameter by 6.68 times, soil water content by 26.47 % (P < 0.05). Additionally, soil total nitrogen was increased by 50.0 % in PGAB treatment, and available nitrogen and phosphorus contents were increased by 1.68 times and 85.83 % (P < 0.05), respectively. Populations of soil-culturable bacteria and fungi of PGAB treatment increased by 65.96 % and 1.23 times, respectively (P < 0.05). After salt-washing process, adding PGAB improved soil physicochemical properties, which altered the ecological environment of rhizosphere soil and promoted plant growth. The results can provide a practical approach for ameliorating coastal saline soils."

      "abstract": "Establishing a physical barrier between the peritoneum and the cecum is an effective method to reduce the risk of postoperative abdominal adhesions. Meloxicam (MX), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug has also been applied to prevent postoperative adhesions. However, its poor water solubility has led to low bioavailability. Herein, we developed an injectable hydrogel as a barrier and drug carrier for simultaneous postoperative adhesion prevention and treatment. A third-generation polyamide-amine dendrimer (G3) was exploited to dynamically combine with MX to increase the solubility and the bioavailability. The formed G3@MX was further used to crosslink with poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) to prepare a hydrogel (GP@MX hydrogel) through the amide bonding. In vitro and in vivo experiments evidenced that the hydrogel had good biosafety and biodegradability. More importantly, the prepared hydrogel could control the release of MX, and the released MX is able to inhibit inflammatory responses and balance the fibrinolytic system in the injury tissues in vivo. The tunable rheological and mechanical properties (compressive moduli: from ∼ 57.31 kPa to ∼ 98.68 kPa;) and high anti-oxidant capacity (total free radical scavenging rate of ∼ 94.56 %), in conjunction with their syringeability and biocompatibility, indicate possible opportunities for the development of advanced hydrogels for postoperative tissue adhesions management.",

      "abstract": "It is of utmost importance to understand the characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of soil in order to optimize soil management and enhance crop yield. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), a stress-resistant amino acid polymer, plays a crucial role in plant drought stress resistance. However, little is known about the effects of γ-PGA on soil characteristics during drought treatments. In this study, the effects of different forms of γ-PGA on soil texture and basic physical and chemical properties under short-term drought conditions were investigated. Furthermore, the impact of γ-PGA on the microbial community and metabolic function of maize was analyzed. Under drought conditions, the introduction of γ-PGA into the soil resulted in notable improvements in the mechanical composition ratio and infiltration capacity of the soil. Concurrently, this led to a reduction in soil bulk density and improved soil organic matter content and fertility. Additionally, metagenomic analysis revealed that under drought conditions, the incorporation of γ-PGA into the soil enhanced the soil microbiota structure. This shift led to the predominance of bacteria that are crucial for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles in the soil. Metabolomics analysis revealed that under drought treatment, γ-PGA affected soil metabolic patterns, with a particular focus on alterations in amino acid and vitamin metabolism pathways. Correlation analysis between the soil metagenome and metabolites showed that microorganisms played a significant role in metabolite accumulation. These results demonstrated that γ-PGA could improve soil characteristics under drought conditions and play an important role in soil microorganisms and microbial metabolism, providing further insights into the changes in soil characteristics under drought conditions."

Poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (PGA) is a non-toxic, biodegradable, and highly water-soluble polymer possessing carboxyl and imino functional groups. Herein, water-insoluble PGA-based hydrogels were prepared, characterized, and investigated as heavy metal adsorbents. The prepared hydrogels were recyclable and exhibited good adsorption effects on heavy metal ions including Cu2+, Cr6+, and Zn2+. The effects of adsorption parameters including temperature, solution pH, initial concentration of metal ions, and contact time on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel for Cu2+ were investigated. The adsorption was a spontaneous and exothermic process. The process followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, implying a physical and monolayer adsorption. The adsorption mechanisms investigation exhibited that Cu2+ adsorbed on the hydrogel via electrostatic interactions with anionic carboxylate groups of PGA in addition to the coordination interactions with the -NH groups. Importantly, the PGA hydrogel exhibited good reusability and the adsorption capability for Cu2+ remained high after five consecutive cycles. The properties of PGA hydrogel make it a potential candidate material for heavy metal ion removal in wastewater treatment."

The occurrence of flocculation is a primary factor limiting the application of the curcumin nano-delivery system. To enhance the environmental stress resistance and functional properties of shellac-curcumin nanoparticles (S-Cur-NPs), γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA) was utilized as an anti-flocculant. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of S-Cur-NPs were also improved with γ-PGA incorporation. FTIR and XRD analysis confirmed the presence of amorphous characteristics in S-Cur-NPs and the combination of γ-PGA and shellac was driven by hydrogen bonding. The hydrophilic, thermodynamic, and surface potential of S-Cur-NPs was improved by the incorporation of γ-PGA. This contribution of γ-PGA on S-Cur-NPs effectively mitigated the flocculation occurrence during heating, storage, and in-vitro digestive treatment. Furthermore, it was revealed that γ-PGA enhanced the antibacterial and antioxidant properties of S-Cur-NPs and effectively protected the functional activity against heating, storage, and in-vitro digestion. Release studies conducted in simulated gastrointestinal fluids revealed that S-Cur-NPs have targeted intestinal release properties.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) is employed extensively in agriculture to enhance soil water retention; however, the underlying mechanism by which γ-PGA improves soil structure and soybean productivity in arid regions remains poorly understood. A micro-scale field experiment was conducted in the arid region of northwest China, employing five concentrations of γ-PGA to investigate its impacts on soybean yield, photosynthesis, and water-use efficiency, as well as soil aggregates and water distribution. The five levels of γ-PGA were 0 (CK), 10 (P1), 20 (P2), 40 (P3), and 80 kg ha-1 (P4). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the application of γ-PGA significantly improved soybean yield, photosynthesis, and chlorophyll content. It resulted in a decrease in soil aggregate content with a maximum diameter of less than 0.053 mm and an increase in the stability of soil aggregates in the uppermost layer of the soil (0-30 cm). The application of γ-PGA significantly increased soil water content, particularly in the uppermost layer of the soil, and effectively reduced water consumption and improving water use efficiency in soybeans. Overall, the P3 treatment exhibited the most pronounced improvement of soybean yield, photosynthesis, water-use efficiency, as well as distribution of soil aggregates and water. The correlation matrix heatmap also revealed a strong correlation between improvement of soybean yield or photosynthesis at various γ-PGA application levels and the enhancement of soil stability or soil water content. CONCLUSION: The multivariate regression analysis revealed that an optimal application level of 46 kg ha-1 γ-PGA could enhance effectively both yield and water use efficiency of soybean in the arid region of northwest China. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Addressing the urgent need for efficient heavy metal removal from aqueous environments, this study delves into using poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) for the bioflocculation of heavy metals. Utilizing γ-PGA variants from Bacillus subtilis with different molecular weights and salt forms (Na-bonded and Ca-bonded), the research evaluates their adsorption capacities for copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) ions. It was found that Na-bonded γ-PGA with a high molecular weight showed the highest heavy metal adsorption (92.2-98.3%), particularly at a 0.5% concentration which exhibited the highest adsorption efficiency. Additionally, the study investigated the interaction of γ-PGA in mixed heavy metal environments, and it was discovered that Na-γ-PGA-HM at a 0.5% concentration showed a superior adsorption efficiency for Pb ions (85.4%), highlighting its selectivity as a potential effective biosorbent for wastewater treatment. This research not only enlightens the understanding of γ-PGA's role in heavy metal remediation but also underscores its potential as a biodegradable and non-toxic alternative for environmental cleanup. The findings pave the way for further exploration into the mechanisms and kinetics of γ-PGA's adsorption properties.",

Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), a natural anionic polymeric compound, is composed of highly viscous homo-polyamide of D and L-glutamic acid units. The extracellular water solubility of PGA biopolymer facilitates its complete biodegradation and makes it safe for humans. The unique properties have enabled its applications in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, water treatment, foods, and other domains. It is applied as a thickener, taste-masking agent, stabilizer, texture modifier, moisturizer, bitterness-reducing agent, probiotics cryoprotectant, and protein crystallization agent in food industries. γ-PGA is employed as a biological adhesive, drug carrier, and non-viral vector for safe gene delivery in tissue engineering, pharmaceuticals, and medicine. It is also used as a moisturizer to improve the quality of hair care and skincare cosmetic products. In agriculture, it serves as an ideal stabilizer, environment-friendly fertilizer synergist, plant-growth promoter, metal biosorbent in soil washing, and animal feed additive to reduce body fat and enhance egg-shell strength."

      "abstract": "In this study, a biodegradable poly-gamma-glutamic-acid nanopolymer (Ɣ-PGA NP) was investigated for its activity against clinical strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli), and reference strains of S. aureus ATCC 6538, S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 (Gram-positive), and Gram-negative E. coli ATCC 25922, and K. pneumoniae ATCC 13884 bacterial biofilms. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) effect of Ɣ-PGA NP showed inhibitory effects of 0.2, 0.4, 1.6, and 3.2 μg/mL for S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also, MIC values were 1.6, 0.8, 0.2, and 0.2 μg/mL for K. pneumoniae ATCC 13884, E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 6538, and S. pyogenes ATCC 19615, respectively. Afterwards, MBEC (minimum biofilm eradication concentration) and MBIC (minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration) were investigated to detect Ɣ-PGA NPs efficiency against the biofilms. MBEC and MBIC increased with increasing Ɣ-PGA NPs concentration or time of exposure. Interestingly, MBIC values were at lower concentrations of Ɣ-PGA NPs than those of MBEC. Moreover, MBEC values showed that K. pneumoniae was more resistant to Ɣ-PGA NPs than E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, and the same pattern was observed in the reference strains. The most effective results for MBEC were after 48 h, which were 1.6, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 µg/mL for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, respectively. Moreover, MBIC results were the most impactful after 24 h but some were the same after 48 h. MBIC values after 48 h were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.1 μg/mL for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, respectively. The most effective results for MBEC were after 24 h, which were 1.6, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.4 µg/mL for K. pneumoniae ATCC 13884, E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 6538, and S. pyogenes ATCC 19615, respectively. Also, MBIC results were the most impactful after an exposure time of 12 h. MBIC values after exposure time of 12 h were 0.4, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.2 μg/mL for K. pneumoniae ATCC 13884, E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 6538, and S. pyogenes ATCC 19615, respectively. Besides that, results were confirmed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which showed a decrease in the number of living cells to 80% and 60% for MBEC and MBIC, respectively, for all the clinical bacterial strains. Moreover, living bacterial cells decreased to 70% at MBEC while decreasing up to 50% at MBIC with all bacterial refence strains. These data justify the CFU quantification. After that, ImageJ software was used to count the attached cells after incubating with the NPs, which proved the variation in live cell count between the manual counting and image analysis methods. Also, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to detect the biofilm architecture after incubation with the Ɣ-PGA NP. In in vivo wound healing experiments, treated wounds of mice showed faster healing (p < 0.00001) than both the untreated mice and those that were only wounded, as the bacterial count was eradicated. Briefly, the infected mice were treated faster (p < 0.0001) when infected with S. pyogenes > S. aureus > E. coli > K. pneumoniae. The same pattern was observed for mice infected with the reference strains. Wound lengths after 2 h showed slightly healing (p < 0.001) for the clinical strains, while treatment became more obvious after 72 h > 48 h > 24 h (p < 0.0001) as wounds began to heal after 24 h up to 72 h. For reference strains, wound lengths after 2 h started to heal up to 72 h."

      "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapy shows immense potential for broad biomedical applications. However, the development of safe and efficacious mRNA delivery vectors remains challenging due to delivery barriers and inefficient intracellular payload release. Herein, we presented a simple strategy to boost the mRNA intracellular release by incorporation of anionic poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) into an ionizable lipid-based LNP/mRNA. We systematically investigated the impact of PGA incorporation on mRNA transfection both in vitro and in vivo. The molecular weights and formulation ratios of PGA greatly affected the transfection efficacy of LNP/mRNA. From in vitro study, the optimized LNP/mRNA/PGA was formulated by incorporation of PGA with the molecular weight of 80 kDa or 200 kDa and the charge ratio (N/P/C) of 25/1/1. The optimized formulation achieved around 3-fold mRNA expression in HeLa cells compared to the bare LNP/mRNA. The intracellular releasing study using specific DNA probe revealed that this enhancement of transfection efficacy was attributed to the elevated mRNA release into cytoplasm. Moreover, the optimized LNP/mRNA/PGA achieved up to 5-fold or 3-fold increase of luciferase mRNA expression in vivo after being injected into mice systematically or intramuscularly, respectively. In addition, the incorporation of PGA did not significantly alter the biodistribution profile of the complexes on both organ and cellular levels. Therefore, our work provides a simple strategy to boost mRNA delivery, which holds great promise to improve the efficacy of mRNA therapeutics for various biomedical applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The process of designing and screening potent mRNA carriers is complicated and time-consuming, while the efficacy is not always satisfying due to the delivery barriers and inefficient mRNA release. This work presented an alternative strategy to boost the mRNA delivery efficacy by incorporating an anionic natural polymer poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) into LNP/mRNA complexes. The optimized LNP/mRNA/PGA achieved up to 3-fold and 5-fold increase in transfection efficacy in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Intracellular releasing analysis revealed that the enhancement of transfection efficacy was mainly attributed to the elevated intracellular release of mRNA. In addition, the incorporation of PGA did not alter the biodistribution or the biosafety profile of the complexes. These findings indicate that PGA incorporation is a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of mRNA therapeutics.",

Owing to its outstanding anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties as well as the potential to promote cell migration and proliferation, hydrogen sulfide(H2S) gas therapy is promising for chronic diabetic wound recovery. In this work, a multifunctional poly(γ-glutamic acid)(PGA) hydrogel encapsulated with keratin-based H2S donor(KTC), ciprofloxacin(Cip), and anthocyanins(Ant) was developed. The resultant hydrogel was capable of releasing H2S, thereby promoting cell proliferation and enhancing anti-inflammation and antioxidant activity. The release of antibiotic Cip was accelerated under a diabetic wound microenvironment, thereby enhancing the antibacterial activity of the hydrogel. The encapsulated Ant could serve as a pH monitor, sensitively indicating wound pH conditions in situ and indirectly reflecting wound infection. In vivo results in diabetic wound healing suggested that PGA/Ant/KTC/Cip hydrogel reduced inflammation and promoted angiogenesis and collagen deposition, thereby accelerating wound healing.",

The strain was identified as a genus of Bacillus by morphological and 16S rDNA sequence analysis and was named Bacillus sp. YJY-8. The optimal medium composition and cultural conditions were studied using a single-factor experiment and a response surface experiment. The optimized medium consisted of monosodium glutamate 70 g/L, glucose 54.3 g/L, glycerol 31.8 g/L, ammonium sulfate 11.1 g/L, yeast extract 3.2 g/L, tryptone 1.5 g/L, L-glutamic acid 6.8 g/L, MgSO4 7H2O 0.5 g/L, FeCl3 6H2O 0.02 g/L, KH2PO4 0.9 g/L, CaCl2 0.03 g/L, MnSO4 H2O 0.3 g/L, ammonium molybdate 0.02 g/L, pH 7.0. The optimal cultivation conditions were 35 °C and pH 7.0. Under the optimized conditions, after 48 hr of cultivation, the highest shaking flask fermentation level of γ-PGA reached 65.2 ± 0.36 g/L. In addition, through fed-batch fermentation in 30 L fermenters, the fermentation level of γ-PGA reached its highest level at 88.42 g/L and productivity was 1.23 g/(L hr) after 72 hr. Then, the effect of γ-PGA on tomato yield was investigated. At the seedling stage, the plant height and stem diameter of γ-PGA treated plants increased by 5.69 and 15.735% after spraying γ-PGA for 19 days. During the flowering and fruiting period, the stem diameter of the γ-PGA treatment group increased by 6.74%, with a maximum increase of 11.65%. The number of fruit branches increased by 0.56-16.29% and the number of fruit sets increased by 1.01-28.47%.

Rationally designed nanoparticles are well suited to maximize cancer vaccination by the inclusion of immune stimulatory adjuvants. Also, nanoparticles might control the pharmacokinetics and destination of the immune potentiating compounds. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) based nanoparticles (NPs), which have a natural origin, can be easily taken up by dendritic cells (DCs), which leads to the secretion of cytokines which ameliorates the stimulation capacity of T cells. The intrinsic adjuvant properties and antigen carrier properties of γ-PGA NPs have been the focus of recent investigations as they can modulate the tumor microenvironment, can contribute to systemic anti-tumor immunity and subsequently inhibit tumor growth. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the potential of γ-PGA NPs as antigen carriers and/or adjuvants for anti-cancer vaccination.",

The results showed that all concentrations of γ-PGA improved decay control and strawberry preservation by enhancing antioxidant capacity, delaying the softening process, and maintaining fruit quality, especially for 100 mg·L-1 γ-PGA. After 14 days of treatment, compared with control, 100 mg·L-1 γ-PGA decreased weight loss, decay rate, and index by 21.9%, 75.0%, and 66.7% and increased the total antioxidant capacity by 43.5% through antioxidant enzymes. In addition, 100 mg·L-1 γ-PGA increased fruit firmness by 53.6% by decreasing the activities of polygalacturonase, pectin lyase, cellulase, and β-galactosidase. In terms of color quality, 100 mg·L-1 γ-PGA improved the values of lightness and yellowness by 30.9% and 52.8%. As regards nutritional quality, 100 mg·L-1 γ-PGA increased the contents of protein, soluble sugars, vitamin C, and total phenols by 106.6%, 80.6%, 51.2%, and 78.4%. In terms of sensory quality, 100 mg·L-1 γ-PGA increased the soluble solids' content by 19.0% and decreased the titrated acids' content by 21.1%, which increased the sugar-acid ratio by 50.9%. Our findings suggest that 100 mg·L-1 γ-PGA can be used to improve the decay control and preservation of strawberry cv. Hongyan under cold storage."

However, the optimal application rate of γ-PGA in legume/non-legume intercropping systems is still unclear. A potted experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of five γ-PGA rates (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4%, represented by CK, P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively) on biological nitrogen (N) fixation (BNF), water-N productivity, and nitrate distribution in a cotton/soybean intercropping system. RESULTS: The results showed that the growth indicators (plant height, stem diameter, leaf area index, root dry weight, root length) of cotton and soybean increased first and then decreased with increasing γ-PGA rates, and all growth indicators of cotton and soybean showed peaks in P3 and P2 treatments. The stable 15 N isotope method indicated that γ-PGA promoted the BNF capacity of soybean and soil. In particular, the percentage of N derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) in soybean reached 61.94% in the P2 treatment. Poly-γ-glutamic acid improved the water-N productivity, and the total N partial factor productivity (NPFP) and water productivity (WP) in P3 treatment increased by 23.80% and 43.86% compared with the CK treatment. The γ-PGA mitigation of potential nitrate residue also decreased first and then increased with increasing γ-PGA rates. CONCLUSION: Multivariate regression analysis showed that 0.22% of the optimal γ-PGA application rate could obtain a higher yield and water-N productivity in cotton/soybean intercropping system simultaneously. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

We designed to develop poly-γ-glutamic acid-modified cationic liposomes (γ-PGA-CL) to co-deliver pemetrexed disodium (PMX) and siRNA to treat NSCLC. Firstly, γ-PGA was modified on the surface of PMX and siRNA co-loaded cationic liposomes by electrostatic interaction (γ-PGA modified PMX/siRNA-CL). In order to evaluate whether the prepared γ-PGA modified PMX/siRNA-CL could be taken up by tumor cells and exert significant anti-tumor effects, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed, with A549 cells and LLC-bearing BABL/c mice as experimental models, respectively. The particle size and zeta potential of γ-PGA modified PMX/siRNA-CL was (222.07 ± 1.23) nm and (-11.38 ± 1.44) mV. A preliminary stability experiment showed the complex could protect siRNA from degradation. In vitro cell uptake experiment indicated the complex group exerted stronger fluorescence intensity and expressed higher flow detection value. Cytotoxicity study showed the cell survival rate of γ-PGA-CL was (74.68 ± 0.94)%. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and western blot technology displayed that the complex could inhibit the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein to promote cell apoptosis. In vivo anti-tumor experiments represented the complex group showed a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth, while the vector showed no obvious toxicity. Therefore, the current studies proved the feasibility of combining PMX and siRNA by γ-PGA-CL as a potential strategy for the treatment of NSCLC.",

However, brownish humic acid (HA) in samples interferes significantly with various analytical methods, especially in optical-based techniques. Here, we implemented a coagulation-flocculation process to carry out continuously an enzymatic reaction without separation and transfer of a sample solution. The elimination of HA in a soil suspension using poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA) by coagulation to minimize the HA interference in soil enzymatic analysis was investigated. As a result of the optimization of preliminary parameters, the removal efficiency of HA was > 92% in 100 mg L-1 HA in neutral pH, using 100 mg L-1 PGA and aluminum trivalent as a coagulant aid. However, the fluorescent intensity of the enzyme product (i.e., 4-methylumbelliferone) decreases by about 50% as HA was removed under the conditions used. A decrease in the enzymatic detection of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was not observed from treated samples even though the initial level of HA was different. The results suggested that the coagulation-flocculation approach is suitable for the reduction of HA interference, while maintaining target analyte detection. Therefore, the proposed sample treatment can be used to examine enzyme activity based on TMB product detection without regular standard addition calibration.",

In our present study, it was found that poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), an environmentally friendly biomacromolecule, significantly improved root development in maize. RESULTS: After treatment with γ-PGA for 7 days, the fresh weight of maize roots was significantly increased and the differences between γ-PGA treated group and control group were mainly caused by the number (higher by 71.87% compared to the control) and length of lateral roots. RNAseq and RT-PCR analyses showed that γ-PGA treatment upregulated the expression of genes related to the synthesis of auxins and auxin signal in maize roots. In addition, γ-PGA promoted the accumulation of plant growth-promoting bacteria, such as Azospirillum, Azohydromonas, Ramlibacter, and Sphingobium (Proteobacteria), Streptomyces (Actinobacteria), Parasegetibacter (Bacteroidetes), and Gemmatimonas (Gemmatimonadetes) in rhizosphere soil and the secretion of auxins. The results of this study deepened our understanding of the effects and mechanism of γ-PGA on maize root development, and as well as highlighted the possibility of using γ-PGA to improve crop growth and soil environment. CONCLUSIONS: γ-PGA promotes early growth and development of maize roots by inducing the secretion and accumulation of auxin in roots and in rhizosphere soil, and increasing the abundance of plant growth promoting bacteria.",

      "abstract": "Heat stress is one of the most common agrometeorological risks in crop production in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. This study aimed to investigate whether glutamic acid (Glu) or poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) biostimulants can improve the thermotolerance of a cool-season Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis) crop. Priming with Glu (2.0 mM) or γ-PGA (20 mg·L-1) was conducted at the third leaf stage by applying as daily foliar sprays for 5 days before 5 days of heat stress (45 °C in 16-h light/35 °C in 8-h dark). Coupled with morpho-physiological and biochemical analyses, transcriptomes of Glu or γ-PGA-primed Chinese cabbage under heat stress were examined by RNA-seq analysis. The results showed that the thermotolerance conferred by Glu and γ-PGA priming was associated with the increased parameters of vegetative growth, gas exchange, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Compared with the control, the dry weights of plants treated with Glu and γ-PGA increased by 51.52% and 39.39%, respectively. Glu and γ-PGA application also significantly increased the contents of total chlorophyll by 42.21% and 23.12%, and carotenoid by 32.00% and 24.00%, respectively. In addition, Glu- and γ-PGA-primed plants markedly inhibited the levels of malondialdehyde, electrolyte leakage, and super-oxide anion radical, which was accompanied by enhanced activity levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and peroxidase (POD). Enrichment analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) categories within the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) functional clusters of RNA-seq data indicated that the expression levels of the genes for DNA replication, DNA repair system, linoleic acid metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis, and plant-pathogen interaction were commonly up-regulated by both Glu and γ-PGA priming. Glu treatment enhanced the expression levels of the genes involved in aliphatic glucosinolate and 2-oxocarboxylic acid, while γ-PGA treatment activated carotenoid cleavage reaction to synthesize abscisic acid. Taken together, both Glu and γ-PGA have great potential for the preadaptation of Chinese cabbage seedlings to heat stress, with Glu being more effective than γ-PGA.",

However, the structural features of EPS and the relationship between these features and the flocculation process and mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, structural features of the microbial product poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) complexed with the heavy metal ions Pb2+ and Cu2+ were characterized and the evolution of these features was identified as having a key role in the flocculation process and mechanism. The secondary structure of the γ-PGA-Pb complex changed significantly, while that of the γ-PGA-Cu complex was only slightly altered. The significant structural change in γ-PGA-Pb was found to be responsible for the combination of residual COOH and Pb2+, promoting the bridging of inter-colloids and faster growth of hydrodynamic diameter. If the conformation changed sufficiently, such as with the γ-PGA-Pb complex in the pH range 4.6-6.2, pH had no impact on the conversion ratio. The unchanged structure of γ-PGA-Cu prevented the flocculation process, although the coordination mode of γ-PGA-Cu resulted in a higher biosorption capacity. This in-depth molecular-level study provides insight into the γ-PGA flocculation mechanism, promoting the use of γ-PGA and γ-PGA producing microorganisms for application in various remediation strategies.",

We designed the rhein (RH)-loaded poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA)-coated polycaprolactone-polyethyleneimine nanoparticles (RGPP) to enhance renal drug distribution and cellular uptake via PGA-mediated receptor-ligand interaction with γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) expressed highly in the kidney. PGA coating not only ensured the stability, sustained drug release, and biocompatibility of RGPP, but also promoted renal cellular uptake via binding with the GGT on the renal cells. Following intravenous administration, PGA coating protects RGPP from recognition by the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in prolonged blood circulation. RGPP enables targeted RH accumulation in the kidneys of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy (DN) mice, resulting in significant recovery of renal physiological function. The PGA coating strategy opens a new avenue for the management of renal diseases using nanomedicine.",

Among the various treatment methods, the most economical and effective is to use a hemostatic agent. A powdered hemostatic agent can be used for wounds of any shape or depth with high compactness and excellent accumulation effect. Herein, we chose the natural, hydrophilic polymer poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) to form composite hemostatic microspheres with sodium alginate (SA), which show good biocompatibility, water absorptivity, and viscosity. The morphology and structure of the hemostatic microspheres were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The overall safety, hemolysis, pyrogenic, and intradermal irritation tests were examined. The relationship between hemostatic pressure and hemostatic time during microsphere use was also measured. The hemostatic effect was analyzed with a liver, spleen, and femoral artery bleeding model. The composite microspheres were well tolerated in vivo and exhibited better hemostatic effects in animal experiments than a microporous polysaccharide powder compound. Research results showed that SA/γ-PGA microspheres are materials with good hemostatic effect, high safety, and great potential in clinical applications.",

Currently, research focuses on materials of natural origin, more friendly to the human body, which are in many cases able to participate actively in the wound healing process. These include polyamino acids of bacterial origin, substances that are biodegradable, non-toxic, and have a great potential for an application not only in the medical field. From the point of view of film wound dressing formulation, poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA), as a film-forming agent, and poly-ε-lysine (PL), characterized by antimicrobial activity, are of interest from this group. Therefore, the aim of our experiment was to prepare films consisting of PGA or a combination of PGA and PL with the addition of different plasticizers. The films were prepared by solvent evaporation method and then evaluated for their organoleptic (appearance, colour, transparency, ease of handling), physicochemical (thickness, density, opacity, surface pH), and mechanical properties (tensile strength and tear resistance). As a result, films showing mutual compatibility between the two polymers were obtained, with satisfactory properties for wound application.",

This material was utilized to prepare electrospun nanofibers with solutions of 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (w/v) mixed with γ-PGA at 5 and 10% w/v, intended as a wound dressing for diabetic foot treatment. These solutions were loaded with chlorogenic acid (CGA), an active hypoglycemic agent. Morphological analysis showed a decrease in size of the fibers with the combination of PVA/γ-PGA compared to pure PVA nanofibers, which was attributed to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the glutaraldehyde vapors, γ-PGA, and PVA that permitted nanofiber cross-linking and allowed CGA release. The in vitro release analysis showed that the PVA membranes reached 28% delivery after the first 24 h. Notably, the nanofiber mat with PVA blended with 5% γ-PGA reached 57% delivery, and the PVA nanofiber with 10% γ-PGA reached 66% release after the same amount of time. The rate constant for the release kinetics showed that PVA with 5% γ-PGA had a higher value than that of the other samples, reaching saturation first."

However, the production cost of γ-PGA is high for the requirement of adding the expensive precursor L-glutamic acid during fermentation, which hinders its widespread application. In this study, in order to improve γ-PGA yield, central carbon metabolism was engineered to enhance the carbon flux of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glutamic acid synthesis in a γ-PGA production strain Bacillus licheniformis WX-02. Firstly, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PdhABCD) and citrate synthase (CitA) were overexpressed to strengthen the flux of pyruvate into TCA cycle, resulting in 34.93% and 11.14% increase of γ-PGA yield in B. licheniformis WX-02, respectively. Secondly, the carbon flux to glyoxylate shunt was rewired via varying the expression of isocitrate lyase (AceA), and a 23.24% increase of γ-PGA yield was obtained in AceA down-regulated strain WXPbacAaceBA. Thirdly, deletion of pyruvate formate-lyase gene pflB led to a 30.70% increase of γ-PGA yield. Finally, combinatorial metabolic engineering was applied, and γ-PGA titer was enhanced to 12.02 g/L via overexpressing pdhABCD and citA, repressing aceA, and deleting pflB, with a 69.30% improvement compared to WX-02. Collectively, metabolic engineering of central carbon metabolism is an effective strategy for enhanced γ-PGA production in B. licheniformis, and this research provided a promising strain for industrial production of γ-PGA.",

This study aimed to test whether γ-PGA and vitamin B6 (VitB6) supplements improve sleep duration and quality. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A factorial randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study included 47 adults (25 men and 22 women) who were free of chronic disease. Stratified randomized allocation considered age and gender for three interventions, group A (supplementation with γ-PGA 600 mg; n = 16), group B (supplementation with VitB6 100 mg; n = 14), and group C (dual supplementation of both γ-PGA 600 mg and VitB6 100 mg; n = 17). Participants underwent a 1-mon intervention period, followed by a 1-mon washout period, and then a second 1-mon intervention period. Differences (mean ± SD) in nighttime sleep status before and after supplementation were compared between the placebo and intervention groups using nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Significant changes in sleep duration (0.27 ± 0.98 h, P < 0.05) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score (-0.52 ± 1.58, P < 0.05) indicating improved sleep status were observed in the intervention compared with the placebo of group C while no significant changes were observed in groups A and B. No statistical significance was detected between the intervention and the placebo; however, there was a greater increase in the group C intervention (4.59 ± 38.5 ng/mL) in serum serotonin concentrations than the groups A and B interventions. No side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings, the dual supplementation of γ-PGA and VitB6 may be effective as functional food components to improve nighttime sleep status.

Its phenomenal properties have gained immense attention in the field of regenerative medicine, the food industry, wastewater treatment, and even in 3D printing bio-ink. The γ-PGA has the potential to replace synthetic non-degradable counterparts, but the main obstacle is the high production cost and lower productivity. Extensive research has been carried out to reduce the production cost by using different waste; however, it is unable to match the commercialization needs. This review focuses on the biosynthetic mechanism of γ-PGA, its production using the synthetic medium as well as different wastes by L-glutamic acid-dependent and independent microbial strains. Furthermore, various metabolic engineering strategies and the recovery processes for γ-PGA and their possible applications are discussed. Finally, highlights on the challenges and unique approaches to reduce the production cost and to increase the productivity for commercialization of γ-PGA are also summarized."

      "abstract": "The most significant challenge in designing wound dressings is to mimic the tissue microenvironment because of the pro-regenerative structural and functional properties of skin. Herein, we developed a type of bionic extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels based on thiol-modified poly (γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA-SH) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (HA-CHO). The rapid and reversible thiol-aldehyde addition reaction of thiols in γ-PGA-SH and aldehyde groups in HA-CHO provided hydrogels with a dynamic covalent network and endowed them with properties of adaptability and self-healing capability, which are conducive for initial wound coverage and for prolonging the lifespan of the dressing. Interestingly, these hydrogels also showed typical viscoelastic characteristics similar to those of natural ECM, degradation property in vitro and in vivo, and free radical scavenging capability. In addition, the gelation time, rheological behavior, mechanical property, porous structure, and degradation process of the hydrogels could be tuned by adjusting polymer content. Furthermore, the ECM-inspired hydrogels significantly enhanced the wound healing process in vivo in a full-thickness skin defect model compared to those by commercial dressing (Tegaderm™) by facilitating angiogenesis and promoting collagen deposition. The successful application of the multifunctional hydrogel as an antioxidant wound dressing for wound treatment significantly exhibited its great application potential for biomedical areas. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The application of tissue engineering techniques to repair full-thickness skin wounds remains a great challenge in clinical trials. Among the recent approaches used for wound healing, in situ forming injectable hydrogels have gained much attention, and few of them have shown satisfactory overall performance, such as integration into the wound bed, biodegradability, immunocompatibility, vascularization, and recapitulation of the structure and function of skin. In the present study, we designed a simple and convenient in situ forming injectable adaptable self-healing hydrogels with biodegradability and antioxidative properties, which could substantially improve wound healing quality at an affordable cost. The hydrogel-based wound dressing is expected to solve the abovementioned problems and help in promoting cutaneous wound healing.",

Laboratory experiments were conducted with a check treatment CK (no γ-PGA added) and two different forms of γ-PGA added to sandy loam soil (T and TM stand for γ-PGA and γ-PGA SAP) at four different soil mass ratios (0.05% (1), 0.10% (2), 0.15% (3) and 0.20% (4)) to determine their effects on sandy loam soil hydro-physical properties. Both of them could reduce the cumulative infiltration of soil water. The total available water (TAW) which the soil water content (SWC) from field water capacity (FC) to permanent wilting point (PWP) after γ-PGA added into sandy loam soil had no significant different compared with CK, and the TAW was highest at the treatment of γ-PGA with 0.10% addition amount into sandy loam soil. However, the TAW of sandy loam soil increased dramatically with the γ-PGA SAP addition amount increasing. TM3 had the highest soil water absorption among the treatments with γ-PGA SAP. The T1 to T4 treatments with γ-PGA addition slightly prolonged retention time (RT) when SWC varied from FC to PWP compared with CK. For γ-PGA SAP addition treatments, the time for SWC varied from FC to PWP was 1.48 times (TM1), 1.88 times (TM2), 2.01 times (TM3) and 2.87 times (TM4) longer than that of CK, respectively. The results of this study will provide further information for the use of these materials in agricultural application.",

      "abstract": "Salt-leaching is considered to be a major method for soil desalting in agriculture. Therefore, conservation of soil nutrition is significant to soil fertility and environment protection during the salt-leaching process. The effect of poly-γ-glutamic acid bioproduct (PGAB), which was manufactured by solid-state fermentation with the bacteria producing glutamic acid (GA) and poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) and organic waste, on keeping nitrogen (N) during salt-leaching was investigated in this study. The isolated bacteria producing GA and γ-PGA were identified as Brevibacterium flavum and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, respectively. After the saline soil was leached for 90 days, compared to the control, soil salinity (0-30 cm) in the PGAB treatment was decreased by 39.9%, while soil total N was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than other treatments. Furthermore, the microbial biomass N (0-30 cm) in PGAB treatment was increased by 119.5%; populations of soil total bacteria, fungi, actinomyces, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, ammonifying bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria and soil algae biomass were also significantly (P < 0.05) increased. In terms of physical properties, the percentage of soil aggregates with diameter > 0.25 mm was increased by 293.5%, and the soil erosion-resistance coefficient was increased by 50.0%. In conclusion, the PGAB can effectively conserve soil N during the process of salt-leaching and therefore offer a sustainable way to improve coastal saline soil.",

Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-pGluA), a naturally occurring anionic biopolymer, showed high affinity with tumor-associated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), which localized on the cell surface and exhibited intracellular redox homeostasis-dependent expression pattern; thus, GGT was utilized for mediating endocytosis of nanoparticles. Herein, GGT-targeting nanopolyplexes (γ-pGluA-CSO@Fe3+, PCFN) consisting of cationic chitosan and GGT-targeting γ-pGluA blended with iron ion were constructed to load reactive oxygen species-induced menadione (MA) and doxorubicin, which were utilized to investigate the mechanism of GGT up-regulation. Briefly, the pretreated PCFN/MA induced an intracellular oxidative stress environment, which facilitated adjusted up-regulated GGT expression and boosted tumor targeting. Subsequently, the destroyed redox homeostasis sensitized tumors for synergistic therapy. The innovative strategy of augmenting active targeting by disturbing intracellular redox homeostasis offers insight for the application of γ-pGluA-derived nanopolyplexes.",

Herein, biocompatible and antimicrobial electrospun nanofibrous mats with photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect were fabricated to accelerate the infected wound healing. The nanofibrous mats were fabricated by co-electrospining of polyanionic poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) and cationic photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin tetra (p-toluenesulfonate) (TMPyP) in aqueous solution and stabilized by the chemical crosslinking. The as-prepared nanofibrous mats can not only confer the moist microenvironment to the wound bed, but also provide potent bactericidal activity upon visible light irradiation by releasing the cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antibacterial assay in vitro showed that they can effectively eradicate the board-spectrum bacteria at a relatively low loading dose of TMPyP (e.g., 0.1 wt%). Meanwhile, those nanofibrous mats showed good biocompatibility with no obvious adverse effects on mammalian cells and red blood cells (RBCs). The animal test in vivo suggested that the restrained inflammatory reaction and better wound healing could be achieved upon timely and effective antibacterial treatment with negligible local toxicities. This biocompatible and antibacterial γ-PGA-TMPyP nanofibrous mat may show great potential in practical infection-resistant applications, particularly for wound dressing applications.",

      "abstract": "It is known that tumor antigens could induce obvious anti-tumor immune responses for efficient cancer immunotherapy when combined with checkpoint blockade. However, the amount of tumor antigens is often limited due to the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, a new type of nanomaterial was developed to improve tumor treatment by the combined action of starving therapy/photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT) and checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. In detail, the immunoadjuvant nanoagents (γ-PGA@GOx@Mn,Cu-CDs) were fabricated by integrating the gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) enzyme-induced cellular uptake polymer-poly (γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA), a glucose-metabolic reaction agent - glucose oxidase (GOx), Mn,Cu-doped carbon dots (CDs) as photosensitizer and self-supplied oxygenator nanodots. γ-PGA@GOx@Mn,Cu-CDs nanoparticles (NPs) showed long retention time at the tumor acidic microenvironment and could further target cancer cells. The NPs also displayed both photothermal and photodynamic effects under laser irradiation at 730 nm. Interestingly, the endogenous generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused by the nanoreactors could significantly relieve tumor hypoxia and further enhance in vivo PDT. By synergistically combining the NPs-based starving-like therapy/PDT/PTT and check-point-blockade therapy, the treatment efficiency was significantly improved. More importantly, the systematic antitumor immune response would eliminate non-irradiated tumors as well, which is promising for metastasis inhibition.",

Thermo-sensitive hydrogel is injectable in situ and can be used to treat large-area wounds. In addition, antioxidants play important roles in promoting wound repair. METHODS: The purpose of this research was to prepare a novel thermo-sensitive hydrogel-poly(N-isopropyl-acrylamide)/poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PP) loaded with superoxide dismutase (SOD) to improve the effect for trauma treatment. The micromorphology of the hydrogel was observed by scanning electron microscope and the physical properties were measured. The biocompatibility of hydrogel was evaluated by MTT experiment, and the effect of hydrogel on skin wound healing was evaluated by in vivo histological staining. RESULTS: Gelling behavior and differential scanning calorimeter outcomes showed that the PP hydrogels possessed thermo-sensitivity at physiological temperature and the phase transformation temperature was 28.2°C. The high swelling rate and good water retention were conducive to wound healing. The activity of SOD in vitro was up to 85% at 10 h, which was advantageous to eliminate the superoxide anion. MTT assay revealed that this hydrogel possessed good biocompatibility. Dressings of PP loaded with SOD (SOD-PP) had a higher wound closure rate than other treatments in vivo in diabetic rat model. DISCUSSION: The SOD-PP thermo-sensitive hydrogels can effectively promote wound healing and have good application prospects for wound repair.",

The highest heavy metal concentrations at the contaminated site were Cu: 1180 mg/kg, Zn: 1450 mg/kg, Ni: 287 mg/kg, and Cr: 316 mg/kg. Batch experiments designed by Taguchi Method were conducted first to assess the effect of different washing conditions on the removal of heavy metals in laboratory. The results of batch experiments show that factors that affected the removal efficiency of heavy metals was of the order γ-PGA concentration > washing time > liquid/soil ratio > rotational speed. The optimal operating parameters for heavy metal removal were γ-PGA 3.5%, liquid/soil ratio 15/1, washing time 60 min, and rotational speed 100 rpm. Under the optimal conditions, up to 50.7% of the major target metal, Cu, was removed. Heavy metals in the soil were mainly Fe-Mn oxide bound and organically bound. On-site treatment using the optimal operating parameters caused 54.3% of Cu removal. When the soil was washed 3 times by γ-PGA, the removal efficiency of Cu was improved to 74.3%. After the treatment, the change in soil bacterial number was insignificant, indicating that γ-PGA is an environmentally friendly washing reagent.",

Using corn stalk and soybean meal, the most common agricultural waste in China, as solid substrates, the maximum production of γ-PGA was 116.88 ± 5.05 g/kg and 102.48 ± 3.30 g/kg in 50 L and 150 L bioreactors, respectively. Production of γ-PGA in 50 L bioreactor was higher than in 150 L bioreactor, demonstrating that a reduction in γ-PGA production occurred as the fermentation system enlarged. An analysis of the interactions among fermentation parameters (temperature, moisture, and pH), γ-PGA production, solid substrates and bacterial communities indicated that different bioreactor capacities caused changes in fermentation parameters and bacterial communities, which in turn affected substrate utilization and γ-PGA production. Overall, obtaining considerable amounts of γ-PGA under non-sterilized fermentation expressed that JX-6 has excellent abilities to adapt to these substrates and conditions. Bioconversion of agricultural waste into γ-PGA in scale-up fermentation was successfully conducted by creating a more stable and suitable fermentation environment in bioreactors.",

We previously isolated a novel γ-PGA producing strain Bacillus licheniformis RK14 from soil and developed a hyper-producing mutant strain RK14-46 by an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treatment. In this study, endo-type (pgdS) and exo-type γ-PGA hydrolases (ggt) were disrupted by integrating plasmids into the genomic DNA of B. licheniformis RK14-46 strain. Unexpectedly, we observed strong inhibition of γ-PGA production following deletion of the pgdS gene, suggesting that pgdS is essential for γ-PGA biosynthesis in strain RK14-46, and in its parent strain RK14. In contrast, γ-PGA production increased by the deletion of the ggt gene and reached 39 g/L in the presence of 90 g/L glucose and elevated oxygen supply. Furthermore, γ-PGA from the ggt-disrupted mutant (Δggt) maintained a larger molecular mass throughout the culture period, whereas that from the original RK14-46 strain had degraded after glucose consumption. γ-PGA-containing culture supernatants from Δggt strain showed greater flocculation efficiency in sewage sludge than supernatants from the RK14-46 strain, reflecting greater production of γ-PGA with larger molecular mass by the Δggt strain. This is the first report concerning the deletion of pgdS and ggt genes in B. licheniformis strain and the properties of γ-PGA obtained from the mutant strain.",

Previously, we developed HPV16 E7-expressing Lactobacillus casei (L. casei-E7) as a therapeutic vaccine candidate for cervical cancer, which induces antitumor therapeutic effects in a TC-1 murine cancer model. To improve the therapeutic effect of L. casei-E7, we performed co-treatment with poly-gamma-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), a safe and edible biomaterial naturally secreted by Bacillus subtilis. We investigated their synergistic effect to improve antitumor efficacy in a murine cancer model. The treatment with γ-PGA did not show in vitro cytotoxicity against TC-1 tumor cells; however, an enhanced innate immune response including activation of dendritic cells was observed. Mice co-administered with γ-PGA and L. casei-E7 showed significantly suppressed growth of TC-1 tumor cells and an increased survival rate in TC-1 mouse models compared to those of mice vaccinated with L. casei-E7 alone. The administration of γ-PGA markedly enhanced the activation of natural killer (NK) cells but did not increase the E7-specific cytolytic activity of CD8+ T lymphocytes in mice vaccinated with L. casei-E7. Overall, our results suggest that oral administration of γ-PGA induces a synergistic antitumor effect in combination with L. casei-E7.",

      "abstract": "IFN-γ therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease and severe malignant osteopetrosis. Despite the promising IFN-γ-based therapeutic applications, its limited success in clinical trials is related with limitations inherent to its molecular properties and with the difficulties to deliver it locally or with adequate periodicity to achieve a therapeutic effect. We have previously shown that chitosan (Ch)/poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) nanoparticles (NPs) are immunostimulatory, impairing colorectal cancer cell invasion. Ch is a biocompatible cationic polysaccharide extensively studied and already approved for biomedical applications while γ-PGA is a poly(amino acid), biodegradable and negatively charged. Here, we evaluated the potential of Ch/γ-PGA NPs as vehicles for IFN-γ and their ability to modulate immune cells' phenotype. In this study, Ch/IFN-γ/γ-PGA nanoparticles (IFN-γ-NPs) prepared by a co-acervation method, presenting a size of approximately 180 nm and a low polydispersity index, were tested for their immunomodulatory activity. These IFN-γ-NPs induced an immunostimulatory profile on dendritic cells (DCs) with increased cell surface costimulatory molecules and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-12p40 and TNF-α. IFN-γ-NPs also modulated the IL-10-stimulated macrophage profile, increasing their ability to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12p40 and TNF-α. Concomitantly, these phenotypic alterations enhanced T cell proliferation. In addition, the ability of DCs and macrophages to induce colorectal cancer cell invasion was hampered in the presence of IFN-γ-NPs. Although the major observations were mediated by Ch/γ-PGA NPs, the incorporation of IFN-γ into NPs potentiated the expression of CD40 and CD86, and the impairment of colorectal cancer cell invasion. This work bridges the previously reported immunostimulatory capacity of Ch/γ-PGA NPs with their potential as carriers for immunomodulatory molecules, like IFN-γ, opening new avenues for their use in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) is a biocompatible and biodegradable polypeptide with wide-ranging applications in foods, cosmetics, medicine, agriculture and wastewater treatment. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 can produce γ-PGA from sucrose that can be obtained easily from sugarcane and sugar beet. In our previous work, it was found that low intracellular glutamate concentration was the limiting factor for γ-PGA production by LL3. In this study, the γ-PGA synthesis by strain LL3 was enhanced by chromosomally engineering its glutamate metabolism-relevant networks. First, the downstream metabolic pathways were partly blocked by deleting fadR, lysC, aspB, pckA, proAB, rocG and gudB. The resulting strain NK-A6 synthesized 4.84 g l-1 γ-PGA, with a 31.5% increase compared with strain LL3. Second, a strong promoter PC 2up was inserted into the upstream of icd gene, to generate strain NK-A7, which further led to a 33.5% improvement in the γ-PGA titre, achieving 6.46 g l-1 . The NADPH level was improved by regulating the expression of pgi and gndA. Third, metabolic evolution was carried out to generate strain NK-A9E, which showed a comparable γ-PGA titre with strain NK-A7. Finally, the srf and itu operons were deleted respectively, from the original strains NK-A7 and NK-A9E. The resulting strain NK-A11 exhibited the highest γ-PGA titre (7.53 g l-1 ), with a 2.05-fold improvement compared with LL3. The results demonstrated that the approaches described here efficiently enhanced γ-PGA production in B. amyloliquefaciens fermentation.",

      "abstract": "The safety of nanomaterials, a crucial consideration for clinical translation, is enhanced by using building blocks that are biologically nontoxic. Here, we used poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) and dopamine as building blocks of polymeric nanomaterials for carrying hydrophobic anticancer drugs. The introduction of phenylalanine onto γ-PGA enabled the resulting amphiphilic derivative of γ-PGA acid to self-assemble in the presence of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to form PTX-encapsulated micelles. The surfaces of PTX-loaded micelles were then coated with polymerized dopamine (PDA). The PDA-coated, amphiphilic γ-PGA-based micelles (AM) carrying PTX (PDA/AM/P) exerted near-infrared-responsive photothermal effects. Near-infrared irradiation of cancer cells treated with PDA/AM/P nanoparticles produced a greater anticancer effect than that observed in other treatment groups, indicating a synergistic effect. Intravenous administration of PDA/AM/P completely ablated tumors and prevented their recurrence. Notably, the in vivo safety profile of PDA/AM/P nanoparticles allowed PTX to be delivered at a 3.6-fold higher dose than was possible with PTX solubilized in surfactant, and circumvented the side effects of the surfactant. These results support the multifunctional potential of PDA/AM for the delivery of various hydrophobic drugs and imaging dyes for safe translation of nanomaterials into the clinic."

The presence of γ-Fe2O3, Ag, and a-CN in the nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Ag + γ-Fe2O3@a-CN catalyzed the degradation of methyl orange. This catalyst was also recycled ten times by magnetic separation without any loss in efficiency. Ag + γ-Fe2O3@a-CN exhibited strong antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. It also exhibited excellent antibacterial activity even after 20 times magnetic recycling.

Although various bionic extracellular matrix (ECM) biomaterials have been designed towards HS treatment, not all biomaterials can synergize biological functions and application functions in wound repair. Bionic scar-inhibiting scaffolds, loaded with biomolecules or drugs, become promising strategies for scarless skin regeneration. In this work, inspired by the physicochemical environment of ECM, a versatile fabrication of poly(γ-glutamic acid) based on electrospun photocrosslinkable hydrogel fibrous scaffolds incorporated with ginsenoside Rg3 (GS-Rg3) is developed for tissue repair and wound therapy. Decorated with adhesive peptide, bionic fibrous scaffolds can accelerate fibroblasts to sprout and grow, forming organized space-filling basement that gradually fills a depression before wound close up in the early stage. Additionally, by sustained release of GS-Rg3 in late stage, fibrous scaffolds promote scarless wound healing in vivo as evidenced by the promotion of cell communication and skin regeneration, as well as the subsequent decrease of angiogenesis and collagen accumulation. These ECM-inspired fibrous scaffolds, therefore, offer new perspectives on accelerated wound healing and tissue regeneration.",

      "abstract": "We hypothesized that soybeans fermented with Bacillus spp. for 48 h (chungkookjang) would be rich in poly-γ-glutamate (γ-PGA) and would have greater efficacy for improving insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, min6 cells, and PC12 neuronal cells. We screened 20 different strains of B. subtillus and B. amyloliquefaciens spp. for γ-polyglutamate (PGA) production and their anti-diabetic and anti-dementia activities in cell-based studies. Chungkookjang made with two B. amyloliquefaciens spp. (BA730 and BA731) were selected to increase the isoflavonoid and γ-PGA. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was higher in 3T3-L1 adipocytes given both chungkookjang extracts than in the cells given vehicle (control). The ethanol extract of BA731 (BA731-E) increased the uptake the most. Triglyceride accumulation decreased in BA731-E and BA731-W and the accumulation increased in BA730-W and BA730-E. The mRNA expression of fatty acid synthetase and acetyl CoA carboxylase was much lower in BA731-E and BA731-W and it was higher in BA730-W than the control. BA730-E and BA730-W also increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ activity. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion increased with the high dosage of BA730-W and BA730-E in insulinoma cells, compared to the control. Insulin contents and cell survival in high glucose media were higher in cells with both BA731-E and BA730-E. Triglyceride deposition and TNF-α mRNA expression were lower in BA731 than the control. The high-dosage treatment of BA730-E and BA731-E increased differentiated neuronal cell survival after treating amyloid-β(25-35) compared to the control. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor, indices of neuronal cell proliferation, were higher in BA730 and BA731 than in the control. Tau expression was also reduced in BA731 more than the control and it was a similar level of the normal-control. In conclusion, BA730 increased PPAR-γ activity and BA731 enhanced insulin sensitivity in the brain and periphery. BA730 and BA731 prevented and alleviated the symptoms of type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease with different pathways.",

Herein, we prepared mechanically robust injectable hydrogels (HA/γ-PGA hydrogels for short) using methacrylate-functionalized hyaluronic acid and poly (γ-glutamic acid) via photopolymerization. The HA/γ-PGA hydrogels showed outstanding anti-compression ability and could suffer a more than 80% strain. Meanwhile, after 5 cycles of compression, HA/γ-PGA hydrogels could still recover quickly against external stress, showing excellent shape recovery capability. Moreover, the mechanical properties could be modulated easily by changing the molar ratio of HA to γ-PGA. The drug release behavior was also evaluated and the drug-loaded HA/γ-PGA hydrogels showed a weak burst release and sustained release behavior. Additionally, HA/γ-PGA hydrogels also exhibited superior biocompatibility. Therefore, HA/γ-PGA hydrogels have great potential as injectable drug carriers for load-bearing tissue application.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in oncolytic adenoviral vectors as an alternative anticancer therapy. The induction of an immune response can be considered as a major limitation of this kind of application. Significant research efforts have been focused on the development of biodegradable polymer poly-gamma-glutamic acid (γ-PGA)-based nanoparticles used as a vector for effective and safe anticancer therapy, owing to their controlled and sustained-release properties, low toxicity, as well as biocompatibility with tissue and cells. This study aimed to introduce a specific destructive and antibody blind polymer-coated viral vector into cancer cells using γ-PGA and chitosan (CH). Adenovirus was successfully encapsulated into the biopolymer particles with an encapsulation efficiency of 92% and particle size of 485 nm using the ionic gelation method. Therapeutic agents or nanoparticles (NPs) that carry therapeutics can be directed specifically to cancerous cells by decorating their surfaces using targeting ligands. Moreover, in vitro neutralizing antibody response against viral capsid proteins can be somewhat reduced by encapsulating adenovirus into γ-PGA-CH NPs, as only 3.1% of the encapsulated adenovirus was detected by anti-adenovirus antibodies in the presented work compared to naked adenoviruses. The results obtained and the unique characteristics of the polymer established in this research could provide a reference for the coating and controlled release of viral vectors used in anticancer therapy.",

In this study, the effect of glucose and glutamic acid on the global gene expression profile of Bacillus subtilis Natto3 was investigated using high throughput microarray, with an emphasis on the PGA operon and genes influencing PGA production. Two treatment groups (set1-in the presence of glutamic acid and set2-in the presence of glutamic acid + glucose) were analyzed against the control (in the presence of glucose). In the microarray, both the groups showed a trend of up-regulation for ywsC and ywtA genes (log2 fold change of 0.55, P = 0.0194, 0.92, P = 0.0069 in set1 and 0.78, P = 0.0023, 0.59, P = 0.0172 in set2, respectively) and down-regulation of ywtB and ywtC genes (log2 fold change of -1.83, P = 0.0001, -1.42, P = 0.0017 in set1 and -1.52, P = 0.0012, -0.55, P = 0.1112 in set2, respectively), supporting the indispensability of the ywsC and ywtA genes in PGA production.

This study evaluates functional restoration of needle puncture injured intervertebral discs with a newly developed injectable hydrogel using the quantitative discomanometry (QD) test. The proposed hydrogel is composed of gelatin and poly (γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) and crosslinked with 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). METHODS: Thirty-six bovine motion segments were distributed into six groups. Needle puncture injured discs were created in all discs except for those in the first group (intact). The second group included injured discs that received no treatment (injury). The remaining four groups included injured discs repaired with injected hydrogels fabricated with different polymer solutions and EDC concentrations including: gelatin/γ-PGA solution crosslinked with the EDC solution at a 10:1 and 40:1 ratio to form the GP/E(10:1) and GP/E(40:1) groups, respectively, and gelatin and γ-PGA solution crosslinked with the EDC solution at a 10:1 ratio to form the G/E(10:1) or P/E(10:1) groups. The QD tests were performed to evaluate disc integrity of all six groups. RESULTS: Among all hydrogel repair groups, the GP/E(10:1) group was found to have the highest leakage and saturate pressure and was the only group comparable to the intact one. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of disc integrity secondary to needle puncture injury can be achieved via the repair with the newly developed gelatin hydrogel incorporated with γ-PGA and EDC.

      "abstract": "Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) has shown considerable promise in the treatment of chlorinated organic compounds, but rapid aggregation and inactivation hinder its application. In this study, palladium-doped zero-valent iron nanoparticles involving poly (γ-glutamic acid) (Fe-Pd@PGA NPs) were synthesized. The nanoparticles were small (~100 nm), uniformly distributed, and highly stable. The dechlorination performance of Fe-Pd@PGA NPs was evaluated using p-CP as a model. The results demonstrated that Fe-Pd@PGA NPs show high activity even in weakly alkaline conditions. The maximum rate constant reached 0.331 min- 1 at pH 9.0 with a Fe to p-CP ratio of 100. Additionally, the dechlorination activity of Fe-Pd@PGA NPs is more than ten times higher than that of the bare Fe-Pd NPs, demonstrating the crucial role of PGA in this system. Furthermore, we investigated the dechlorination performance in the presence of different anions. The results indicated that Fe-Pd@PGA NPs can maintain high activity in the presence of Cl-, H2PO4-, and humic acid, while HPO42-and HCO3- ions slightly reduce the dechlorination activity. We believed that PGA is a promising stabilizer and promoter for Fe-Pd NPs and the Fe-Pd@PGA NPs have the potential for practical applications."

      "abstract": "Triptolide (TP) exhibits immunosuppressive, cartilage-protective and anti-inflammatory effects in rheumatoid arthritis. However, the toxicity of TP limits its widespread use. To decrease the toxic effects, we developed a novel nano-drug carrier system containing TP using poly-γ-glutamic acid-grafted di-tert-butyl L-aspartate hydrochloride (PAT). PAT had an average diameter of 79±18 nm, a narrow polydispersity index (0.18), a strong zeta potential (-32 mV) and a high drug encapsulation efficiency (EE1=48.6%) and loading capacity (EE2=19.2%), and exhibited controlled release (t1/2=29 h). The MTT assay and flow cytometry results indicated that PAT could decrease toxicity and apoptosis induced by free TP on RAW264.7 cells. PAT decreased lipopolysaccharides/interferon γ-induced cytokines expression of macrophage (P<0.05). In vivo, PAT accumulated at inflammatory joints, improved the survival rate and had fewer side effects on tumor necrosis factor α transgenic mice, compared to TP. The blood biochemical indexes revealed that PAT did not cause much damage to the kidney (urea nitrogen and creatinine) and liver (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase). In addition, PAT reduced inflammatory synovial tissue area (P<0.05), cartilage loss (P<0.05), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast area (P<0.05) and bone erosion (P<0.05) in both knee and ankle joints, and showed similar beneficial effect as free TP. In summary, our newly formed nanoparticle, PAT, can reduce the toxicity and guarantee the efficacy of TP, which represents an effective drug candidate for RA with low adverse side effect.",

      "abstract": "Poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA) was easily phosphorylated by direct addition of phosphorylating agents into the culture medium of Bacillus subtilis (natto). Tetrapolyphosphate salt was the most incorporated into PGA molecules of all used reagents. Phosphorylation occurred at the α-carboxyl side chains of PGA molecule. The amounts of bound phosphate to PGA were dependent on the amounts of added phosphorylating agent. In low molecular weight regions of less than 100 kDa, a cross-linked peak was observed in the phosphorylated PGAs, whereas their peaks at approximately 1000 kDa shifted to a higher molecular weight due to the bound phosphate. The PGA derivatives had a wide range in viscosity up to 15/1000 to 15 times when compared to the native PGA, depending on the degree of phosphorylation (DP) in the PGA derivatives. The PGA with low DP had a high viscosity due to the unfolding conformation whereas highly phosphorylated PGA had aggregation with low viscosity. Heat treatment at 80 °C after the addition of phosphate salt elicited a novel collagen-like helix structure. These observations show that phosphorylation is an effective way to diversify the physicochemical properties of PGA.",

This study demonstrates in silico modeling of monoclonal antibody cetuximab (CET MAb)-conjugated docetaxel (DOCT)-loaded poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) nanoparticles (Nps) and evaluates the in vitro/in vivo effects on EGFR-overexpressing gastric cancer cells (MKN-28). Nontargeted DOCT-γ-PGA Nps (NT Nps: 110±40 nm) and targeted CET MAb-DOCT-γ-PGA Nps (T Nps: 200±20 nm) were prepared using ionic gelation followed by 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)carbodiimide-N-Hydoxysuccinimide (EDC-NSH) chemistry. Increased uptake correlated with enhanced cytotoxicity induced by targeted Nps to EGFR +ve MKN-28 compared with nontargeted Nps as evident from MTT and flow cytometric assays. Nanoformulated DOCT showed a superior pharmacokinetic profile to that of free DOCT in Swiss albino mice, indicating the possibility of improved therapeutic effect in the disease model. Qualitative in vivo imaging showed early and enhanced tumor targeted accumulation of CET MAb-DOCT-γ-PGA Nps in EGFR +ve MKN-28-based gastric cancer xenograft, which exhibited efficient arrest of tumor growth compared with nontargeted Nps and free DOCT. Thus, actively targeted CET MAb-DOCT-γ-PGA Nps could be developed as a substitute to conventional nonspecific chemotherapy, and hence could become a feasible strategy for cancer therapy for EGFR-overexpressing gastric tumors.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Anticancer immune responses depend on efficient presentation of tumor antigens and co-stimulatory signals provided by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). However, it is described that immature dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages at the tumor site may have an immunosuppressive profile, which limits the activity of effector T cells and supports tumor progression. Therapeutic targeting of these innate immune cells, either aiming at their elimination or re-polarization towards an immunostimulatory profile, has been pointed as an attractive approach to control tumor progression. In the present work, we assessed the potential of Chitosan (Ch)/Poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) nanoparticles (NPs) to modulate macrophages and DCs inflammatory profile and to impair their ability to promote cancer cell invasion. Interestingly, Ch/γ-PGA NPs, prepared by co-acervation method, induced an immunostimulatory DCs phenotype, enhancing the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD86, CD40 and HLA-DR, and the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-12p40 and IL-6. Furthermore, Ch/γ-PGA NPs re-educated IL-10-stimulated macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory profile, decreasing the expression of CD163 and promoting the secretion of IL-12p40 and TNF-α. These alterations in the immune cells phenotype promoted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation/proliferation and partially inhibited APCs' ability to induce colorectal cancer cell invasion. Overall, our findings open new perspectives on the use of Ch/γ-PGA NPs as an immunomodulatory therapy for antigen-presenting cells reprogramming, providing a new tool for anticancer therapies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The immune system is responsible to detect and destroy abnormal cells preventing the development of cancer. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment can compromise the immune response favoring tumor progression. Thus, immune system modulation towards an immunostimulatory profile can improve anticancer therapies. This research focus on the development of chitosan/poly(γ-glutamic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) to modulate human antigen-presenting cells (APCs) phenotype and to counteract their pro-invasive capacity. Interestingly, Ch/γ-PGA NPs had a prominent effect in inducing macrophages and dendritic cells immunostimulatory phenotype, thus favoring T cell proliferation and inhibiting colorectal cancer cell invasion. We propose that their combination with other immunomodulatory drugs or conventional anticancer therapies can improve patients' outcome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) is a biopolymer with many useful properties making it applicable for instance in food and skin care industries, in wastewater treatment, in biodegradable plastics or in the pharmaceutical industry. γ-PGA is usually produced microbially by different Bacillus spp. The produced γ-PGA increases the viscosity of the fermentation broth. In case of shake flask fermentations, this results in an increase of the volumetric power input. The power input in shake flasks can be determined by measuring the torque of an orbitally rotating lab shaker. The online measurement of the volumetric power input enables to continuously monitor the formation or degradation of viscous products like γ-PGA. Combined with the online measurement of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR), the respiration activity of the organisms can be observed at the same time. RESULTS: Two different Bacillus licheniformis strains and three medium compositions were investigated using online volumetric power input and OTR measurements as well as thorough offline analysis. The online volumetric power input measurement clearly depicted changes in γ-PGA formation due to different medium compositions as well as differences in the production behavior of the two investigated strains. A higher citric acid concentration and the addition of trace elements to the standard medium showed a positive influence on γ-PGA production. The online power input signal was used to derive an online viscosity signal which was validated with offline determined viscosity values. The online measurement of the OTR proved to be a valuable tool to follow the respiration activity of the cultivated strains and to determine its reproducibility under different cultivation conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the volumetric power input and the OTR allows for an easy and reliable investigation of new strains, cultivation conditions and medium compositions for their potential in γ-PGA production. The power input signal and the derived online viscosity directly reflect changes in γ-PGA molecular weight and concentration, respectively, due to different cultivation conditions or production strains."

The shear rate-induced transition leading to the decrease of viscosity was not observed in J-5 whereas the derivative modified by potassium metaphosphate (J-6) as well as unmodified PGA (J-1) showed the typical decrease of viscosity. In circular dichroism (CD) measurement of J-5, there was a significant loss of the negative chirality CD signal, implying that protein aggregation occured at decreasing pH from 6.2 to 4.4. The thioflavin T fluorescence intensity of the aqueous solution in the J-5 was extremely high despite the absence of heat-treatment.

The new isolate assimilated inulin more efficiently than other carbohydrates from Jerusalem artichoke, without hydrolytic treatment. To investigate the effect of inulin on γ-PGA production, the transcript levels of γ-PGA synthetase genes (pgsB, pgsC, pgsA), regulatory genes (comA, degQ, degS), and the glutamic acid biosynthesis gene (glnA) were analyzed; inulin addition upregulated these key genes. Without exogenous glutamate, strain NX-2S could produce 6.85±0.22g/L of γ-PGA during fermentation. Exogenous glutamate greatly enhances the γ-PGA yield (39.4±0.38g/L) and productivity (0.43±0.05g/L/h) in batch fermentation.

      "abstract": "Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), a natural biopolymer, is widely used in cosmetics, medicine, food, water treatment, and agriculture owing to its features of moisture sequestration, cation chelation, non-toxicity and biodegradability. Intracellular glutamic acid, the substrate of γ-PGA, is a limiting factor for high yield in γ-PGA production. Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis are both important γ-PGA producing strains, and B. subtilis synthesizes glutamic acid in vivo using the unique GOGAT/GS pathway. However, little is known about the glutamate synthesis pathway in B. licheniformis. The aim of this work was to characterize the glutamate dehydrogenase (RocG) in glutamic acid synthesis from B. licheniformis with both in vivo and in vitro experiments. By re-directing the carbon flux distribution, the rocG gene deletion mutant WX-02ΔrocG produced intracellular glutamic acid with a concentration of 90ng/log(CFU), which was only 23.7% that of the wild-type WX-02 (380ng/log(CFU)). Furthermore, the γ-PGA yield of mutant WX-02ΔrocG was 5.37g/L, a decrease of 45.3% compared to the wild type (9.82g/L). In vitro enzymatic assays of RocG showed that RocG has higher affinity for 2-oxoglutarate than glutamate, and the glutamate synthesis rate was far above degradation. This is probably the first study to reveal the glutamic acid synthesis pathway and the specific functions of RocG in B. licheniformis. The results indicate that γ-PGA production can be enhanced through improving intracellular glutamic acid synthesis.",

      "abstract": "Polycation-based delivery presents a major method for non-viral gene therapy. However, the disadvantages of cationic vectors are their tendencies to be captured and eliminated by the reticuloendothelial system due to their excessive positive charges and nonspecific interaction with normal cells that leads to adverse effects. PEGylation was applied to solve these major problems. Yet, PEG chains can severely compromise cellular uptake and yield unsatisfying efficiency resulting in a so-called PEG dilemma. We developed a γ-PGA-based GGT-targeting and surface camouflage strategy by constructing a ternary complex system via a layer-by-layer self-assembly method. The biodegradable polyanion γ-PGA could protect the PEI/pDNA complexes from interaction with the body fluid components; however, in endosome, the polyanion facilitated the intracellular release of PEI/pDNA. The γ-PGA/PEI/pDNA nanoparticles possessed a markedly improved serum-tolerant capability. More importantly, γ-PGA interacts with the tumor-associated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that can mediate endocytosis of the nanoparticles. With pTRAIL as the therapeutic gene, the γ-PGA/PEI/pTRAIL nanoparticles effectively inhibited tumor cell proliferation by inducing cell apoptosis and arresting cell cycles. The in vivo results displayed effective suppression of tumor growth, and high treatment efficacy in the mice bearing cervical tumor. The γ-PGA-based GGT-targeting and surface camouflage strategy is a potential method for improved gene delivery and cancer therapy."

To investigate whether poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) can alleviate the negative effects of salt stress on wheat, a foliar application of 400 mg/L γ-PGA was applied to wheat seedlings, which were then subjected to 150 mM NaCl. Our results showed that after application of γ-PGA, the plant height, the plant weight, and the antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase were significantly increased compared with the treatment of 150 mM NaCl alone. Meanwhile, γ-PGA application also resulted in high accumulation of K+ and decreased storage of Na+ in wheat leaves. These results suggest that γ-PGA treatment may improve salt tolerance of wheat by diminishing ionic imbalances and enhancing antioxidant capacity.

Poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) that has been produced extensively using bacteria, especially those of Bacillus subtilis species, was modified with cholesterol (γ-PGA/Chol), and the γ-PGA/Chol conjugates were used to form polymeric nanoparticles the size of 21.0±1.1 nm in aqueous solution. When the polymeric nanoparticles were mixed with doxorubicin (Dox), raspberry-like hydrogel particles (RBHPs) were formed by the electrostatic interaction between the cationically charged Dox and the anionically charged nanoparticles. The average size and surface charge of the RBHPs in aqueous solution were 444.9±122.5 nm and -56.44 mV, respectively. The loaded amount of Dox was approximately 63.9 μg/mg of RBHPs. The RBHPs showed controlled drug release behavior in both in vitro and ex vivo cell-based experiments. Through fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the cellular uptake of RBHPs into human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) was analyzed. The cytotoxic effect, evaluated by the methyl tetrazolium salt assay, was dependent on both the concentration of RBHPs and the treatment time. The pH-dependent membrane-disrupting properties of the RBHPs and the subsequent cytosolic delivery of Dox were evaluated using a standard hemolysis assay. Upon an increase in hydrophobicity at the lysosomal acidic pH, RBHPs could easily interact, penetrate cell membranes, and destabilize them. Taken together, the data suggested that RBHPs could be used as drug delivery carriers after loading with other therapeutic drugs, such as proteins or small interfering RNA for cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP), the leading disorder in terms of years lived with disability. Inflammation can play a role in LPB, while impairs IVD regeneration. In spite of this, different inflammatory targets have been purposed in the context of IVD regeneration. Anti-inflammatory nanoparticles (NPs) of Chitosan and Poly-(γ-glutamic acid) with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac (Df), were previously shown to counteract a pro-inflammatory response of human macrophages. Here, the effect of intradiscal injection of Df-NPs in degenerated IVD was evaluated. For that, Df-NPs were injected in a bovine IVD organ culture in pro-inflammatory/degenerative conditions, upon stimulation with needle-puncture and interleukin (IL)-1β. Df-NPs were internalized by IVD cells, down-regulating IL-6, IL-8, MMP1 and MMP3, and decreasing PGE2 production, compared with IL-1β-stimulated IVD punches. Interestingly, at the same time, Df-NPs promoted an up-regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, namely collagen type II and aggrecan. Allover, this study suggests that IVD treatment with Df-NPs not only reduces inflammation, but also delays and/or decreases ECM degradation, opening perspectives to new intradiscal therapies for IVD degeneration, based on the modulation of inflammation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Degeneration of the IVD is an age-related progressive process considered to be the major cause of spine disorders. The pro-inflammatory environment and biomechanics of the degenerated IVD is a challenge for regenerative therapies. The novelty of this work is the intradiscal injection of an anti-inflammatory therapy based on Chitosan (Ch)/Poly-(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) nanoparticles (NPs) with an anti-inflammatory drug (diclofenac, Df), previously developed by us. This drug delivery system was tested in a pro-inflammatory/degenerative intervertebral disc ex vivo model. The main findings support the success of an anti-inflammatory therapy for degenerated IVD that not only reduces inflammation but also promotes native IVD matrix production.",

      "abstract": "To overcome the obstacles of easy dissolution of PVA nanofibers without crosslinking treatment and the poor electrospinnability of the PVA cross-linked nanofibers via electrospinning process, the PVA based electrospun hydrogel nanofibers are prepared with post-crosslinking method. To expect the electrospun hydrogel fibers might be a promising scaffold for cell culture and tissue engineering applications, the evaluation of cell proliferation on the post-crosslinking electrospun fibers is conducted in this study. At beginning, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), PVA/sodium alginate (PVASA) and PVA/poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PVAPGA) electrospun fibers were prepared by electrospinning method. The electrospun PVA, PVASA and PVAPGA nanofibers were treated with post-cross-linking method with glutaraldehyde (Glu) as crosslinking agent. These electrospun fibers were characterized with thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and their morphologies were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). To support the evaluation and explanation of cell growth on the fiber, the study of 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell growth on the surface of pure PVA, SA, and PGA thin films is conducted. The proliferation of 3T3 on the electrospun fiber surface of PVA, PVASA, and PVAPGA was evaluated by seeding 3T3 fibroblast cells on these crosslinked electrospun fibers. The cell viability on electrospun fibers was conducted with water-soluble tetrazolium salt-1 assay (Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1). The morphology of the cells on the fibers was also observed with SEM. The results of WST-1 assay revealed that 3T3 cells cultured on different electrospun fibers had similar viability, and the cell viability increased with time for all electrospun fibers. From the morphology of the cells on electrospun fibers, it is found that 3T3 cells attached on all electrospun fiber after 1day seeded. Cell-cell communication was noticed on day 3 for all electrospun fibers. Extracellular matrix (ECM) productions were found and cell-ECM adhesion was shown on day 7. The cell number was also increased on all of the crosslinked electrospun fibers. It seems that the PVA based electrospun hydrogel nanofibers prepared with post-crosslinking method can be used as scaffold for tissue engineering.",

Poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) is a potential plant growth regulator that may be an effective cryoprotectant that prevents crops from damage during cold weather. In this study, the effects of γ-PGA on the physiological responses of rape seedlings subject to cold stress were investigated using hydroponic experiments. We determined that the malondialdehyde content was decreased by 33.4% and the proline content was increased by 62.5% by γ-PGA after 144 h under cold stress. Antioxidant enzymes activities were also evidently enhanced after treatment with γ-PGA. These responses counteracted increases in the fresh weight and chlorophyll content of rape seedlings, which increased by 24.5 and 50.9%, respectively, after 144 h, which meant that growth inhibition caused by cold was mitigated by γ-PGA. Our results also showed that γ-PGA also regulated Ca(2+) concentrations in the cytoplasm and calcium-dependent protein kinases, which are associated with cold resistance. In conclusion, we suggest that the Ca(2+)/CPKs signal pathway is involved in the γ-PGA-mediated enhancement of cold resistance in rape seedlings.",

However, their applications have been limited because of their poor bioactivity, making them poor at bone-bonding. In this study, the bioactivity of a Co-Cr alloy was evaluated following the immobilization of cross-linked poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) onto its surface via the formation of 11-aminoundecylphosphonic acid self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the presence of a new P2p peak, which confirms SAMs formation. Furthermore, the surface became highly hydrophobic following the immobilization with γ-PGA. Subsequent treatment with CaCl2 at 0.5 M or more and soaking in a simulated body fluid led to the formation of a low crystalline apatite. The present results show that chemical modification can be used to induce the formation of an apatite layer on the surface of a Co-Cr alloy in simulated body fluid.",

The structure of the copolymers and the characteristic of the micelles were studied. The release profiles of doxorubicin as a model drug from the micelles were measured.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of γ-PGA on the treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN). A retrospective observational study on γ-PGA therapy for biopsy-proven VAIN was conducted. The efficacy was assessed by evaluating the results of Pap cytology and the viral load of high-risk HPV at three time points: at enrollment, and at the first and second post-treatment visits. Of 17 patients treated with γ-PGA, only 12 patients who had a high-risk HPV infection were included in the analysis. Histology was VAIN1 in seven patients, VAIN2 in two patients, and VAIN3 in three patients. γ-PGA was administered for newly diagnosed VAIN in five (41.7%) patients and persistent VAIN in seven (58.3%) patients for the mean time of 4.5 months. At the first and second post-treatment visits, cytological regression was observed in five (41.7%) and six (50%) patients, respectively. Regarding the HPV load, the overall response rate was 66.7%, and the mean level was 670.6 ± 292.5 RLU at the first follow-up, which was lower than the initial viral load of 1,494.8 ± 434.5 RLU (p = 0.084). At the second follow-up, the overall response rate was 58.3%, and the mean viral load level was 924.2 ± 493.7 RLU. γ-PGA may be helpful for the cytological regression and reduction of viral load in patients with high-risk HPV-positive VAIN, suggesting that γ-PGA is a promising treatment option for primary or persistent VAIN.",

However, there are no adjuvants which can achieve these requirements. In this study, amphiphilic poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) with various kinds of hydrophobic amino acid ethyl esters (AAE) was synthesized (γ-PGA-AAE) and used to prepare antigen-encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs). γ-PGA-graft-Leu (γ-PGA-Leu, where Leu = leucine ethyl ester), γ-PGA-graft-Phe (γ-PGA-Phe, where Phe = phenylalanine ethyl ester), and γ-PGA-graft-Trp (γ-PGA-Trp, where Trp = tryptophan ethyl ester) formed monodispersed NPs that encapsulated ovalbumin (OVA). The type and the induction level of the antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunities could be controlled by the kinds of hydrophobic segments and vaccine formulation (encapsulation or mixture) used. When OVA was encapsulated into NPs, the cellular immunity was dominantly induced, while humoral immunity was dominant when OVA was mixed with NPs. These results are a first report to demonstrate that the balance and induction level of cellular and humoral immunities could be controlled by modifying compositions of NPs and vaccine formulation. Our results suggest that γ-PGA-AAE NPs can provide safe and efficient nanoparticle-based vaccine adjuvants, and the results also provide guidelines in the rational design of amphiphilic polymers as vaccine adjuvants which can control the balance of immune responses.",

PGA is reported to have a number of beneficial health effects, and interestingly, it has been identified as a possible anti-cancer compound through its ability to promote apoptosis in cancer cells, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Our findings demonstrate that PGA inhibits the pro-proliferative functions of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a known chemical carcinogen in HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells. This inhibition was accompanied by hallmark apoptotic phenotypes, including DNA fragmentation and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase 3. In addition, PGA treatment reduced the expression of genes known to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer cells, including cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Lastly, PGA promoted activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein (AMPK) in HT-29 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that PGA treatment enhances apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells, in part by modulating the activity of the COX-2 and AMPK signaling pathways. These anti-cancer functions of PGA make it a promising compound for future study.",

The areas of wounds treated with UHMW γ-PGA were significantly decreased on days 8 and 16, as compared with those receiving a control treatment, and more than 70% of the UHMW γ-PGAtreated area was repaired by day 8. Hematoxylin and eosin staining confirmed that the epidermis had regenerated in the UHMW γ-PGA-treated wounds. At 16 days post wounding, collagen pigmentation and cross-linking were increased as compared with the control groups, and greater regeneration of blood vessels had occurred in UHMW γ-PGA-treated groups. Increased levels of transforming growth factor-beta and β-catenin were also observed in skin samples collected from UHMW γ-PGA-treated animals on days 8 and 16 post incision.

When the infection-mimicking γ-PGA was immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen, increase in the dendritic cell (DC)-mediated functions such as activation, maturation, antigen uptake, migration to lymph nodes, and priming of lymphocytes, which included cross-presentation, was observed. These DC-mediated functions were found to be facilitated by γ-PGA in a dose-dependent manner, with stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) being one of the underlying mechanisms. The in vivo efficacy of γ-PGA was tested in a mouse tumor model where both arms of adaptive immunity (humoral and cell-mediated) were found to be significantly enhanced in the presence of γ-PGA, indicating efficient priming of B and T cells. Moreover, immunization of mice with γ-PGA followed by EG7-OVA tumor challenge led to dramatic inhibition of tumor growth. After 71 days, the cured mice were rechallenged with tumor cells at a distant site in order to test the memory effect. No tumor growth was observed, which indicates the presence of a systemic, long-lasting immune response. Based on these results, low molecular weight γ-PGA is expected to have tremendous potential for applications in cancer immunotherapy.",

The average size of PAMCN was 132 ± 18 nm determined by light scattering (LS) and 158 ± 67 nm by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope analysis showed that the drug carrier (PAMN) could specifically bind to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). PAMCN enhanced the efficacy of CDDP to HUVEC cells with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value decreased to 90.83 ± 33.00 μg/ml comparing with free CDDP treatment and showed less tube formation amounts (p < 0.01) than free CDDP in matrigel angiogenesis inhibition assay in vitro. In vivo toxicity experiment indicated that the survival rate of KM mice in PAMCN group was 100% and PAMCN reduced the hepatic and renal toxicity significantly compared to free CDDP group.

By performing an in vitro experiment to analyze the inhibitory effects of UHMW γ-PGA on 5-alpha reductase activity, we determined that UHMW γ-PGA did in fact inhibit 5-alpha reductase activity, indicating the use of UHMW γ-PGA as a potential 5-alpha reductase inhibitor in the treatment of men with androgenetic alopecia. To evaluate the promotion of hair growth in vivo, we topically applied UHMW γ-PGA and minoxidil on the shaved dorsal skin of telogenic C57BL/6 mice for 4 weeks. At 4 weeks, the groups treated with UHMW γ-PGA showed hair growth on more than 50% of the shaved skin, whereas the control group showed less hair growth. To investigate the progression of hair follicles in the hair cycle, hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed. Histological observations revealed that the appearance of hair follicles was earlier in the UHMW γ-PGA-treated group than in the control group. The number of hair follicles on the relative area of shaved skin in the UHMW γ-PGA-treated group was higher than that observed on the shaved skin in the control group. These results indicate that UHMW γ-PGA can promote hair growth by effectively inducing the anagen phase in telogenic C57BL/6 mice.",

These nanoparticles (NPs) have preferable particle size, high encapsulation efficiency and a pH-dependent release profile. As expected, The Tf modification mediate specific targeting to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (C666-1) cells and human cervical carcinoma (Hela) cells with the transferrin receptor (TfR) overexpressed and enhance cellular uptake of the NPs, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy assays. In vitro cytotoxicity studies reveal that the NPs have excellent biocompatibility, and the presence of Tf enhance the activity of PTX to the targeted cells. All these results prove that Tf modified γ-PGA-MAL-PLA-DPPE NPs could facilitate the tumor-specific therapy. Therefore, such a targeting drug delivery system provides significant advances toward cancer therapy.",

In this research, immuno-stimulating agent toll-like receptor-7 (TLR-7) agonist-imiquimod and low dose chemotherapeutic agent-paclitaxel were synergized to demonstrate tumor therapy along with anti-tumor memory effect. Both therapeutic agents being water insoluble were dispersed in water with the help of water soluble polymer: poly (γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) using a co-solvent systems leading to formation of micro-dispersions of drugs. Paclitaxel and imiquimod formed crystalline microstructures in the size range of 2-3 μm and were stably dispersed in γ-PGA matrix for more than 6 months. Paclitaxel and combination of paclitaxel and imiquimod had significant tumor killing effect in-vitro on various tumor cell lines, while antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells-DCs) treated with the same concentration of imiquimod along with the combination led to enhanced proliferation (250%). In DCs, enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory and Th1 cytokines was observed in cells co-treated with paclitaxel and imiquimod dispersed in γ-PGA. When administered by intra-tumoral injection in mouse melanoma tumor model, the treatment with combination exemplified drastic inhibition of tumor growth leading to 70% survival as compared to individual components with 0% survival at day 41. The anti-tumor response generated was also found to have systemic memory response since the vaccinated mice significantly deferred secondary tumor development at distant site 6 weeks after treatment. The relative number and activation status of DCs in-vivo was found to be dramatically increased in case of mice treated with combination. The dramatic inhibition of tumor treated with combination is expected to be mediated by both chemotherapeutic killing of tumor cells followed by uptake of released antigen by the DCs and due to enhanced proliferation and activation of the DCs.",

In this work, an attempt is made to facilitate the release of a gene by incorporating a negatively-charged poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γPGA) into CS complexes in order to diminish their attractive interactions. The mechanisms of exploiting γPGA to enhance the transfection efficiency of CS complexes are elucidated. The feasibility of using this CS/γPGA-based system for DNA or siRNA transfer is explored as well. Additionally, potential of the CS/γPGA formulation to deliver disulfide bond-conjugated dual PEGylated siRNAs for multiple gene silencing is also examined. Moreover, the genetic use of pKillerRed-mem, delivered using complexes of CS and γPGA, to express a membrane-targeted KillerRed as an intrinsically generated photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy is described.",

We found that oral administration of γPGA dramatically reduced the development of AD in NC mice. Antigen-presenting cells activated with γPGA produced pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL12/23 and IFNγ, which, in turn, induced the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells. Concomitantly, Th2 responses, such as high levels of serum IgE, were dramatically decreased. Furthermore, in vivo γPGA treatment altered several cellular components of allergic reactions, such as mast cells and eosinophils.

      "abstract": "Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 is a glutamate-independent poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) producing strain which consists of a circular chromosome (3,995,227 bp) and an endogenous plasmid pMC1 (6,758 bp). The study of the function of native plasmid and the genome-size reduction of the B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 strain requires elimination of the endogenous plasmid. Traditional plasmid-curing procedures using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or acridine orange combined with heat treatment have been shown to be ineffective in this strain. Plasmid incompatibility is an effective method for curing which has been studied before. In our research, the hypothetical Rep protein gene and the origin of replication of the endogenous plasmid were cloned into the temperature-sensitive vector yielding the incompatible plasmid pKSV7-rep-ori. This plasmid was transformed into LL3 by electroporation. The analysis of the strain bearing incompatible plasmids after incubation at 30 °C for 30 generations showed the production of plasmid cured strains. High frequency of elimination was achieved with more than 93 % of detected strains showing to be plasmid-cured. This is the first report describing plasmid cured in a γ-PGA producing strain using this method. The plasmid-cured strains showed an increase of γ-PGA production by 6 % and led to a yield of 4.159 g/l, compared to 3.918 g/l in control and cell growth increased during the early stages of the exponential phase. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) characterization revealed that the γ-PGA produced by plasmid-cured strains and the wild strains were identical in terms of molecular weight. What is more, the further study of plasmid function showed that curing of the endogenous plasmid did not affect its sporulation efficiency.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with the rapid spread of obesity. Obesity induces insulin resistance, resulting in β-cell dysfunction and thus T2DM. Green tea extract (GTE) has been known to prevent obesity and T2DM, but this effect is still being debated. Our previous results suggested that circulating green tea gallated catechins (GCs) hinders postprandial blood glucose lowering, regardless of reducing glucose and cholesterol absorption when GCs are present in the intestinal lumen. This study aimed to compare the effect of GTE with that of GTE coadministered with poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), which is likely to inhibit the intestinal absorption of GCs. METHODS: The db/db mice and age-matched nondiabetic mice were provided with normal chow diet containing GTE (1%), γ-PGA (0.1%), or GTE+γ-PGA (1%:0.1%) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: In nondiabetic mice, none of the drugs showed any effects after 4 weeks. In db/db mice, however, weight gain and body fat gain were significantly reduced in the GTE+γ-PGA group compared to nondrug-treated db/db control mice without the corresponding changes in food intake and appetite. Glucose intolerance was also ameliorated in the GTE+γ-PGA group. Histopathological analyses showed that GTE+γ-PGA-treated db/db mice had a significantly reduced incidence of fatty liver and decreased pancreatic islet size. Neither GTE nor γ-PGA treatment showed any significant results. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GTE+γ-PGA treatment than GTE or γ-PGA alone may be a useful tool for preventing both obesity and obesity-induced T2DM."

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), inflammation is promoted and sustained by angiogenesis; however, the role played by γ-PGA in this condition is unclear. Therefore, we evaluated γ-PGA effects on angiogenesis and inflammation in a dextran sulfate sodium-(DSS-) induced mouse colitis model. Experimental colitis was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by administering 3% DSS. Disease activity index (DAI), histopathological scores, microvascular density, myeloperoxidase activity, and VEGF-A and VEGFR2 expression were compared among control mice, DSS-treated mice, and mice receiving 3% DSS along with γ-PGA at 50 mg/kg body weight per day or 3% DSS with γ-PGA at 200 mg/kg body weight per day. We found that γ-PGA significantly attenuated weight loss, DAI, and colon shortening. γ-PGA also significantly reduced histopathological evidence of injury. Moreover, γ-PGA significantly attenuated DSS-induced blood vessel densities. Furthermore, γ-PGA attenuated DSS-induced expression of VEGF-A and its receptor, VEGFR2. In addition, γ-PGA treatment led to reduced recruitment of leukocytes to the inflamed colon. Therefore, our results indicate that γ-PGA has potential application in conditions marked by inflammatory-driven angiogenesis and mucosal inflammation.",

Thiolated gamma-PGA was synthesized by covalent coupling between the carboxyl groups of gamma-PGA and the primary amine group of cysteamine. Doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded gamma-PGA nanogels were fabricated using the following steps: (1) an ionic nanocomplex was formed between thiolated gamma-PGA as the negative charge component, and Dox as the positive charge component; (2) addition of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) induced hydrogen-bond interactions between thiol groups of thiolated gamma-PGA and hydroxyl groups of PEG, resulting in the nanocomplex; and (3) disulfide crosslinked gamma-PGA nanogels were fabricated by ultrasonication. The average size and surface charge of Dox-loaded disulfide cross-linked gamma-PGA nanogels in aqueous solution were 136.3 +/- 37.6 nm and -32.5 +/- 5.3 mV, respectively. The loading amount of Dox was approximately 38.7 microgram per mg of gamma-PGA nanogel. The Dox-loaded disulfide cross-linked gamma-PGA nanogels showed controlled drug release behavior in the presence of reducing agents, glutathione (GSH) (1- 10 mM). Through fluorescence microscopy and FACS, the cellular uptake of gamma-PGA nanogels into breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was analyzed. The cytotoxic effect was evaluated using the MTT assay and was determined to be dependent on both the concentration and treatment time of gamma-PGA nanogels. The bio-derived gamma-PGA nanogels are expected to be a well-designed delivery carrier for controlled drug delivery applications.",

METHODS: In this study, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) modified with an edible biopolymer poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) were synthesized by coprecipitation method, characterized and evaluated for their removal efficiency of heavy metals from a metal solution, and simulated gastrointestinal fluid (SGIF). RESULTS: Instrumental characterization of bare- and PGA-SPIONs revealed 7% coating of PGA on SPIONs with a spherical shape and an iron oxide spinel structure belonging to magnetite. The particle sizes as determined from transmission electron microscopy images were 8.5 and 11.7 nm for bare- and PGA-SPIONs, respectively, while the magnetization values were 70.3 and 61.5 emu/g. Upon coating with PGA, the zeta potentials were shifted from positive to negative at most of the environmental pH (3-8) and biological pH (1-8), implying good dispersion in aqueous suspension and favorable conditions for heavy metal removal. Batch studies showed rapid removal of lead and cadmium with the kinetic rates estimated by pseudo-second-order model being 0.212 and 0.424 g/mg · min, respectively. A maximum removal occurred in the pH range 4-8 in deionized water and 5-8 in SGIF corresponding to most gastrointestinal pH except for the stomach. Addition of different ionic strengths (0.001-1 M sodium acetate) and essential metals (Cu, Fe, Zn, Mg, Ca, and K) did not show any marked influence on lead removal by PGA-SPIONs, but significantly reduced the binding of cadmium. Compared to deionized water, the lead removal from SGIF was high at all pH with the Langmuir monolayer removal capacity being 98.70 mg/g for the former and 147.71 mg/g for the latter. However, a lower cadmium removal capacity was shown for SGIF (23.15 mg/g) than for deionized water (31.13 mg/g). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PGA-SPIONs could be used as a metal chelator for clinical treatment of metal poisoning.",

However, systemic administration of anti-CD40 mAbs can be associated with severe side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and liver damage. With the aim to increase the immunostimulatory potency as well as to achieve a local drug retention of anti-CD40 mAbs, we linked an agonistic mAb to immune activating amphiphilic poly(γ-glutamic acid) nanoparticles (γ-PGA NPs). We demonstrate that adsorption of anti-CD40 mAb to γ-PGA NPs (anti-CD40-NPs) improved the stimulatory capacity of the CD40 agonist, resulting in upregulation of costimulatory CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, as well as IL-12 secretion. Interestingly, anti-CD40-NPs induced strong synergistic proliferative effects in B cells, possibly resulting from a higher degree of CD40 multimerization, enabled by display of multiple anti-CD40 mAbs on the NPs. In addition, local treatment with anti-CD40-NPs, compared to only soluble CD40 agonist, resulted in a significant reduction in serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α in a bladder cancer model. Taken together, our results suggest that anti-CD40-NPs are capable of synergistically enhancing the immunostimulatory effect induced by the CD40 agonist, as well as minimizing adverse side effects associated with systemic cytokine release. This concept of nanomedicine could play an important role in localized immunotherapy of cancer.",

The particle size of PG-M was about 120-320 nm, and there was no significant difference in Fe3O4 and PG-M particle size, Fe3O4 was only as the support of PG-M core and did not directly involve in the reaction. The shape of PG-M was irregular cubic structure. The experiments were applied to quantify adsorptive time, pH, competitive ion and organics on the removal effect of Pb2+. The results showed that PG-M was effective in removal of Pb2+; the equilibrium amount of adsorptive was as high as 93.3 mg/g and the optimized condition of pH value for metal ions removal was 7.0, while contact time was about 45 min. The removal efficiency of Pb2+ was not significantly influenced by Na+ while was reduced with the increasing concentration of Ca2+. The removal of Pb2+ was enhanced with the presence of organic matter (humic acid, HA) when the concentration of HA was below 5 mg/L, and decreased when the concentration of HA exceeded 5 mg/L. Langmuir isotherms fitted the experimental data better compared to Freundlich isotherms. Pseudo second order model well described the sorption kinetics of Pb2+. The used PG-M can be desorbed by 0.1 mol/L HCl and became reusable. PG-M is nontoxic and eco-friendly, which have a good prospect in water treatment.",

      "abstract": "Chitosan (CS) has been investigated as a non-viral carrier for gene delivery, but resulting in a relatively low transfection. To address this concern, we developed a ternary system comprised the core of CS/DNA complex and the outer coating of an anionic polymer, poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA). In molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we found that γ-PGA was entangle tightly with the excess CS emanating from the surface of test complexes, thus making them more compact. With γ-PGA coating, the extent of test complexes internalized and their transfection efficiency were evidently enhanced. Trypsin treatment induced a concentration-dependent decrease in internalization of the γ-PGA-coated complexes, suggesting a specific protein-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis inhibition study indicates that the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) present on cell membranes was responsible for the uptake of test complexes. The amine group in the N-terminal γ-glutamyl unit on γ-PGA played an essential role in the interaction with GGT. When entangled with CS, the free N-terminal γ-glutamyl unit of γ-PGA on test complexes was exposed and might thus be accommodated within the γ-glutamyl binding pocket of the membrane GGT. Above results suggest that the γ-PGA coating on CS/DNA complexes can significantly enhance their cellular uptake via a specific GGT-mediated pathway. Knowledge of the uptake mechanism is crucial for the development of an efficient vector for gene transfection.",

      "abstract": "We investigated the effect of high molecular weight polygamma- glutamic acid (hm gamma-PGA) on adiposity and lipid metabolism of rats in the presence of an obesity-inducing diet. Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a normal-fat (11.4% kcal fat, NFC) or high-fat (51% kcal fat, HFC) diet. After 5 weeks, half of each diet-fed group was treated with hm gamma-PGA (NFP or HFP) for 4 weeks. The HFC group had significantly higher body weight, visceral fat mass, fasting serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and leptin, and lower serum HDL cholesterol level compared with those of the NFC group (p < 0.05). Treatment with hm gamma-PGA decreased body weight gain and perirenal fat mass (p<0.05), fasting serum total cholesterol, and mRNA expression of glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), regardless of dietary fat contents (p < 0.01). However, hm gamma-PGA increased serum HDL cholesterol in the HFC group (p < 0.05). In vitro, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMGCoA) reductase activity was suppressed by the addition of hm gamma-PGA. In agreement with observations in animal study, the supplementation of hm gamma-PGA (150 mg/day) to 20 female subjects in an 8-week double-blind, placebocontrolled study resulted in a tendency to decrease total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations. We thus conclude that dietary supplementation of hm gamma-PGA may act as a hypocholestrolemic agent, secondary to its inhibitor effect on HMG-CoA reductase, and decrease abdominal adiposity by decreasing hepatic lipogenesis. The present study is an important first step in establishing the effect of hm gamma-PGA on cholesterol levels in rats and humans.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways that is mediated by Th2 responses. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) is an extracellular polymeric compound that is synthesized by Bacillus cells. Previously, we found that γ-PGA promoted Th1 cell development in a manner dependent on antigen-presenting cells, but inhibited Th2 cell development. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of γ-PGA on dendritic cells (DCs), and its potential for treating Th2-mediated allergic asthma. METHODS: Wild-type, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 deficient, and TLR-4-defective mice were used. DCs derived from the bone marrow and extracted from the lung were stimulated with γ-PGA and assayed for the expression of signalling molecules, costimulatory molecules, and cytokines. Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) to induce asthma. They were repeatedly injected intranasally with γ-PGA before and during the challenge period, and inflammation and structural remodelling of the airways were examined. RESULTS: γ-PGA selectively signalled conventional DCs to activate NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to the up-regulation of CD86, CD40, and IL-12, but not IL-10 and IL-6. These effects of γ-PGA were dependent on TLR-4 and independent of TLR-2. Importantly, the intranasal administration of γ-PGA to OVA-sensitized/challenged mice reduced the airway hyperresponsiveness and allergic inflammation such as leucocyte influx, goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophilia, and Th2 cytokine production. In addition to lowered IgE titres, the treatment of mice with γ-PGA significantly reduced the multiplication and Th2 polarization of mediastinal lymph node T cells upon allergen-specific restimulation. These anti-asthmatic effects of γ-PGA were also abolished in TLR-4-defective mice. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our data indicate that γ-PGA activates DCs to favour Th1 cell induction through a TLR-4-dependent pathway and alleviates pathologic symptoms in a Th2-biased asthmatic model. These findings highlight the potential of γ-PGA for the treatment of asthma and other allergic disease in which Th2 polarization plays an important role.",

      "abstract": "The advantage of polymeric drug carriers lies in the uptake of the polymer nanoparticles by cancer cells before they release the drug, thereby reducing its toxic effects on healthy cells. A poly(gamma-glutamic acid)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-b-poly(gamma-glutamic acid) block copolymer was synthesized to encapsulate the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin in the treatment of wild type human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/WT). This pH-controllable carrier is negatively-charged in the presence of healthy tissues leading to lower cellular uptake. On the other hand, it becomes more hydrophobic in the acidic environment of cancer tissues, increasing its cellular uptake through the lipid bilayer. The block copolymer was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic light scattering. The micelles formed at a critical concentration range of 62-130 microg/mL depending on the composition of poly(gamma-glutamic acid) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) chains. The nano-sized micelles were found to have pH-dependent sizes in the range of 90-200 nm. The role of poly(gamma-glutamic acid) was to increase the hydrophilicity and decrease the particle size of the copolymer. The structures of micelles that were more compact and less anionic showed better stability in plasma. It was found that the drug loading content and drug loading efficiency were 12.14% and 97.22% respectively. The copolymer showed shrinking and aggregation at low pH which led to a slower drug release. These nano-sized micelles showed potential as effective drug delivery carriers for doxorubicin because of its accumulation and slow release inside the MCF-7/WT cells.",

The anti-inflammatory effects of the NPs containing dexamethasone (DEX-NPs) were examined using qRT-PCR in vitro by counting activated microglia and Fluorogold-labeled retinal ganglion cells in the retinas under excitotoxicity or by counting TUNEL (+) photoreceptors in the detached retinas. The NPs were taken up efficiently by cultured macrophages or microglia. At day 7, 60-80% of the diffuse signal remained in the cytoplasm of these cells. In normal rat eyes, the NPs did not accumulate in the retinas and no inflammatory cells were recruited. Conversely, under pathological conditions, the NPs were localized in activated CD11b-positive cells in the retina. DEX-NPs suppressed the expression of TNFα and MCP-1 in cultured macrophages or microglia, the activation of microglia, the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in excitotoxic retinas, and the number of TUNEL (+) photoreceptors in detached retinas. These data suggest that γ-PGA-Phe NPs can be a powerful tool for suppressing inflammatory cells in pathological conditions in the retina.",

The results showed the incorporation of γ-PGA at 200 and 400 mg/kg could reduce the accumulation of lead in the liver, heart, and testis; however, the latter was more effective in decreasing the lead content in the kidney and spleen. Nevertheless, both doses failed to inhibit the lead accumulation in the lung and brain. Additionally, both doses of γ-PGA could reduce TBARs in the kidney and brain, as well as elevate δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydrase (δ-ALAD) activity in blood and decrease glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) activities in the serum. For hematological parameters, both white blood cells (WBCs) and hematocrite (HCT) were raised by 400 mg/kg of γ-PGA, while for both doses of γ-PGA, a slight decline in hemoglobin (HGB), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was observed, with the red blood cells (RBCs) being unaffected.",

First, we assessed the eye irritancy potential of gamma PGA in rabbits. Additionally, we studied the effects of gamma-PGA on corneal wound healing, due to the anti inflammatory properties and water retaining abilities of gamma-PGA. In this study, the effects of gamma-PGA on corneal wound healing after an alkali burn were evaluated. Thirty eyes wounded by alkali burning in 30 white rabbits were divided into three groups: group A was treated with 0.1% 5000 kDa gamma-PGA for 2 days, group B was treated with 0.1% hyaluronic acid, and group C was not treated, as a control. The area of corneal epithelial defect was examined at 12, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h after corneal alkali wounding to determine initial wound healing. We found that gamma-PGA promoted corneal wound healing, compared with controls, and showed similar effects to hyaluronic acid. These results indicate that gamma-PGA stimulates corneal wound healing by an anti inflammatory effect and enhancing cell migration and cell proliferation. gamma-PGA is a promising biomaterial that may be a substitute for hyaluronic acid in corneal wound healing treatment.",

In this study, the gene expression in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) treated with gamma-PGA NPs was examined by oligonucleotide microarray analysis and compared with that in cells treated with other adjuvants. The gene expression of proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and costimulatory molecules was upregulated considerably in DCs treated with gamma-PGA NPs. The upregulation pattern was similar to that in DCs treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not to that in DCs treated with unparticulate gamma-PGA. The activation of DCs by gamma-PGA NPs was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of genes related to Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. The effect of gamma-PGA NPs on DCs was not annihilated by treatment with polymyxin B, an inhibitor of LPS. Furthermore, the immunization of mice with gamma-PGA NPs carrying ovalbumin (OVA) as an antigen significantly induced antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells and antigen-specific production of interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma interferon from the cells. Such activities of gamma-PGA NPs were more potent than those obtained with immunization with OVA plus aluminum hydroxide or OVA plus complete Freund's adjuvant. These results suggest that gamma-PGA NPs induce a CD8(+) T-cell response by activating innate immunity in a fashion different from that of LPS. Thus, gamma-PGA NPs may be an attractive candidate to be developed further as a vaccine adjuvant.",
