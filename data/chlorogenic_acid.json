      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA) on human semen and on oxidative stress (OS) induced in vitro in human spermatozoa. After the treatment of the basal semen with 100 µM CGA, rapid and slow sperm progressive motility were evaluated and seminal F2-Isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs), a marker of OS, were quantified by ELISA. In a second set of experiments, semen was treated with 100 µM CGA, 1 mM H2O2 to induce OS, or H2O2+CGA; untreated samples were used as controls. Then, sperm motility, DNA integrity by the acridine orange test, F2-IsoPs and Nrf2 mRNA expression by RT-PCR were quantified. In CGA-treated specimens, rapid progressive sperm motility was increased (p < 0.01) and F2-IsoP levels decreased (p < 0.001) versus controls. The increase of F2-IsoP levels and DNA damage and the decrease of sperm motility after H2O2 treatment was reversed in the presence of CGA, which upregulated Nrf2 mRNA expression. These findings contributed to clarifying CGA's antioxidant activity and highlighted the positive impact of CGA on sperm progressive motility, suggesting also a possible mechanism of action based on the Nrf2 pathway. CGA can be useful during human semen handling procedures in the laboratory and in optimizing the recovery of motile spermatozoa through selection techniques during assisted reproductive technology protocols."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of cilomilast (CILO), a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, alone and in combination with chlorogenic acid (CGA), a natural polyphenol, against scopolamine (SCOP)-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Forty male albino mice were divided into five groups: normal control, SCOP control, CGA + SCOP, CILO + SCOP and CILO + CGA + SCOP. Behavioral assessments, including the Y-maze and pole climbing tests, demonstrated that SCOP significantly impaired cognition, while treatment with CILO and CGA reversed these deficits, with the combination group showing the greatest improvement. Histopathological analyses revealed that CILO and CGA reduced neuronal damage and amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation. Immunohistochemical and biochemical assessments confirmed a decrease in neuroinflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Molecular analyses showed that CILO restored cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), key regulators of neuronal plasticity and survival. CGA enhanced these effects by further inhibiting PDE4, amplifying the neuroprotective response. These findings suggest that PDE4 inhibitors, particularly in combination with CGA, may represent promising therapeutic strategies for AD-related cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are pivotal in sustaining skeletal muscle and the systemic metabolic balance. Chlorogenic acid (CA) is a common dietary antioxidant known for its ability to modulate metabolic homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the impact of CA on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorder in skeletal muscle. C57BL/6J mice fed with a HFD were treated with CA for 12 weeks. The study assessed the overall glycolipid metabolic status, exercise performance, muscle fiber type, and antioxidant capacity of skeletal muscle in HFD-fed mice treated with CA. Results showed that CA reduced fat accumulation, improved exercise capacity, and enhanced mitochondrial performance in HFD-fed mice. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that lactate metabolism and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) responded positively to CA intervention. Molecular mechanisms demonstrated that CA intervention improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function, promoting FAO and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and ultimately reducing fat deposition in skeletal muscle induced by HFD feeding. Mechanistically, CA decreased HFD-induced lactate production and protein lactylation in skeletal muscle, highlighting the importance of the LDHA-lactate axis in mitochondrial function improvement by CA. Therefore, this study provides additional insights supporting the potential of CA as a natural dietary supplement for metabolic syndrome and associated disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp) infection poses a significant global public health challenge, with the misuse of antibiotics further contributing to the development of resistance and triggering harmful inflammatory responses. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by CRKp under sub-lethal concentration of MEM pressure (KOMV-MEM) exhibit enhanced virulence and greater efficiency in transferring resistance genes. METHODS: We investigated the inhibitory effects of chlorogenic acid (CA) on KOMV-MEM characteristics and its protective role in KOMV-MEM infected mice. Based on LC-MS proteomic analysis of vesicles, we screened for potential targets of KOMV-MEM in promoting macrophage (MØ) pyroptosis pathways and inducing resistance gene transfer. Subsequently, computational predictions and experimental validation were performed to determine how CA regulates these mechanisms. RESULTS: This study confirmed that, under MEM pressure, the exacerbated infection levels in CRKp-inoculated mice are attributable to the high virulence of KOMV-MEM. Computational and experimental results demonstrated that CA inhibits pyroptosis by reducing MØ capture of KOMV-MEM through blocking the interaction between GroEL and LOX-1. Furthermore, CA prevents the spread of resistance genes by disrupting the conjugation and transfer processes between KOMV-MEM and recipient bacteria. Finally, in vitro and in vivo assays showed that CA inhibits KOMV-MEM resistance enzymes, thereby preventing the hydrolysis of MEM in the environment and depriving susceptible bacteria of protection. DISCUSSION: These findings provide the first confirmation that CA can inhibit both the virulence and the transmission of drug resistance in KOMV-MEM. This underscores the potential of CA treatment as a promising antimicrobial strategy against CRKp infection."

      "abstract": "Glyphosate, a widely used herbicide against broadleaf weeds and grasses, has been associated with various harmful effects. Our study examines the efficacy of chlorogenic acid (CGA) in alleviating the toxicity of a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) in 42 Wistar rats across six groups of seven animals receiving either no treatment (control), CGA alone (50 mg/kg), GBH alone (800 mg/kg), or their combinations varying three CGA doses (12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg) (CGA12.5+GBH, CGA25+GBH, and CGA50+GBH, respectively) by oral gavage over 49 days in a row. At the end of the experiment, samples of blood, brain, heart, liver, and kidney tissues were collected and analysed for oxidative stress indicators (MDA, GSH, SOD, CAT), oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG), liver and kidney function markers (AST, ALT, ALP, urea, and creatinine) as well as for histopathological changes. As expected, GBH increased AST ALT, ALP, urea, creatinine, 8-OHdG, and MDA levels, and lowered GSH levels and SOD and CAT activities, leaving histopathological changes in the brain, heart, liver, and kidney tissues. CGA dose-dependently improved biochemical and oxidative stress parameters and reversed histopathological changes in GBH-treated albino rats. Our findings consistently confirm the potential of CGA as a promising natural agent against the adverse health effects associated with exposure to glyphosate. Future research should focus on long-term glyphosate exposure and CGA treatment using molecular methods and on the signalling pathways associated with oxidative stress.",

Both ultrasound and thermal treatment are effective methods for preparing starch-CA complexes, but the two treatments have different effects on different starches. Characterization of the complexes prepared using the two methods showed that thermal treatment and ultrasound reduced the crystallinity of starch to some extent, with thermal treatment having a greater effect. Thermal treatment also reduced the amount of double-helix structures in starch. In contrast, ultrasound was relatively mild and had less effect on starch granular structure. However, these two methods promoted the binding of CA, thereby increasing the crystallinity of starch and forming a more ordered and compact structure, which, to some extent hindered the enzymatic degradation of starch. Moreover, the RDS of starch-CA complexes were reduced to different degrees, with the most significant changes in U (PS-CA) and T (CS-CA), which were reduced by 5.96 % and 4.55 %, respectively."

      "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI) is a universal liver disease and the predominant cause of acute liver failure in clinical practice. Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular degradation pathway, with accumulating evidence indicating its involvement in APAP hepatotoxicity. Notably, the serine/threonine AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) pathway serves as the most classical autophagy pathway and engages in autophagy activation. Thus, pharmacological activation of the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway has emerged as a critical strategy for addressing AILI. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a main bioactive constituent isolated from Lonicera japonica Thunb., is an autophagy regulator with potential for AILI therapy. However, whether and how CGA modulates autophagy to antagonize AILI has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we aim to explore the impact of CGA on AILI, as well as the underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that CGA could protect the mice and LO2 cells from oxidative stress and liver injury induced by APAP. Regarding mechanisms, CGA activated the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway, thereby promoting autophagy. This was evidenced by the degradation of p62/SQSTM1 (hereafter referred to as p62), as well as the up-regulation of LC3B, ATG5, and Beclin1. It is worth noting that the aforementioned, CGA-provided beneficial effects were abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of AMPK with Compound C (CC, an AMPK inhibitor). These [Formula: see text] that CGA alleviates oxidative stress and liver injury induced by APAP, which is contingent upon the regulatory effect of CGA on the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 axis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a polyphenol present in various dietary sources and plants, has been shown to reduce skin inflammation. However, its efficacy and mechanisms of action in AD have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of CGA on AD in mice and explored its mechanism. METHODS: To establish a BALB/c mouse model of AD induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) to evaluate the therapeutic potential of CGA. The anti-inflammatory effects of CGA were assessed by measuring IL-1β and IL-6 levels in TNF-α-stimulated HaCaT cells. The phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, Akt1, NF-κB, and IκB-α were analyzed using Western blotting. Molecular docking was conducted to evaluate the binding affinity of CGA to Akt1. RESULTS: Topical application of CGA significantly reduced dermatitis scores, spleen index, epidermal thickness, mast cell infiltration, and skin fibrosis. CGA reversed DNCB-induced increases in IgE, histamine, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 levels. Western blot analysis showed that CGA inhibited the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways. In vitro, CGA exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the Akt1/NF-κB pathway, and the Akt activator (SC79) can counteract this effect. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations suggest that CGA may inhibit Akt1 activity by interacting with specific residues (ALA-50, GLY-37, TYR-326, ASP-323). CONCLUSIONS: CGA improves AD by inhibiting the Akt1/NF-κB pathway, suggesting its potential as a natural treatment for AD."

      "abstract": "Mucositis, a common side effect of the chemotherapeutic drug 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), causes severe and aggravating effects on mucosal cells in the oral cavity and intestine. This study in mice aimed to assess the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mucosal protective properties of chlorogenic acid in mitigating 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. To investigate these potential protective effects, we developed a mouse model by administering an initial intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 5-FU, followed by daily i.p. injections of chlorogenic acid (10 and 20 mg/kg) for 10 consecutive days. Chlorogenic acid mitigated intestinal histopathological damage, reduced proinflammatory mediators and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and increased the glutathione (GSH) level by 5-FU. Chlorogenic acid treatment led to a significant reduction in the expression of inflammation-related proteins decreased oxidative stress-related proteins and, attenuated the expression of apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins in small intestinal tissues. Additional investigations are necessary to verify our findings and enhance our comprehension of how SIRT1 inhibition (EX-527) counteracts the anti-inflammatory effects of chlorogenic acid in intestinal tissues. In conclusion, our mice study has shown that chlorogenic acid exerts its protective effects on 5-FU-induced intestinal tissue damage, by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation through the modulation of multiple signaling pathways, including the TLR4/NF-κB/MAPK, AMPK/ SIRT1, and PI3K/AKT axis.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The intestinal mucosal barrier is an important line of defense for the body, protecting it from intestinal bacteria, endotoxins, and antigens. Cisplatin, a clinical important chemotherapy medicine, is found the side effect with impairing intestinal epithelial cells' structure and function, even causes intestinal mucositis which causes patients immense suffering and hinders the process of cancer treatment. Chlorogenic acid, as the component only second to caffeine in coffee, has been proved the contribution on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal benefits. So, we investigate the protective effect of chlorogenic acid on cisplatin induced intestinal barrier structure and function injury in mice from the perspective of gut microbiota. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were divided into 4 groups, including the control group, a cisplatin group, a chlorogenic acid treatment group receiving intraperitoneal injections alongside cisplatin (Cis + CGA1), and the last group pre-treated with chlorogenic acid before cisplatin administration (Cis + CGA2). The inflammation factor of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in colonic tissue and serum were detected, respectively. To explore the protection of chlorogenic acid on mucosal barrier's integrity, we also detected the fecal LPS and the expression of occludin and ZO-1 proteins in colon tissue. And H&E staining was used to study the histopathological conditions of the colon tissue. Moreover, this article also utilized16S rDNA sequencing to analyze the gut microbiota of feces. RESULTS: Chlorogenic acid administration reduced IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α level in both colon tissue and serum compared to the cisplatin alone treatment group. Furthermore, chlorogenic acid pretreatment notably improved intestinal barrier integrity by enhancing the expression of occludin and ZO-1 proteins in colon tissues. Moreover, 16S rDNA sequencing showed that compared with the control group, cisplatin group showed a reduced microbiota diversity, elevating abundance of Proteobacteria and pro-inflammatory environment of the increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. However, chlorogenic acid treatment especially the pretreatment reversed the reduced microbiota diversity, elevating abundance of Proteobacteria and F/B ratio. DISCUSSION: Microbiota diversity and all results suggest that chlorogenic acid treatment was able to mitigate these intestinal microbiota disorder and diversity reduction induced by cisplatin, effectively offer a protective effect against the inflammatory response and destruction of the mucosal barrier in the intestines caused by cisplatin."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed non-apoptotic cell death characterized by the accumulation of free iron ions and lipid peroxidation. It is associated with the inactivation of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and the accumulation of lipid peroxides within cells. Ferroptosis is closely related to the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chlorogenic acid (CGA), an important bioactive component found in 61 traditional Chinese medicines such as Eucommia ulmoides, has been extensively studied for its effects on various malignant tumors. However, the specific role and potential mechanism of CGA in HCC remain unclear. AIM: To elucidate the anti-tumor characteristics and potential mechanisms of CGA in inducing ferroptosis in HCC cells. METHODS: The effects of CGA on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells were evaluated through in vitro experiments. Bioinformatics analysis combined with network pharmacology was used to study the potential targets and molecular mechanisms of CGA intervention in HCC ferroptosis. In vitro experiments were conducted to verify and explore the anti-HCC effects and mechanisms of CGA through the ferroptosis pathway. RESULTS: In vitro experiments showed that CGA dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of HCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis combined with network pharmacology revealed that the pathway of CGA intervention in HCC cell ferroptosis was mainly enriched in the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2)/aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3)/GPX4 signaling pathway, which was associated with arachidonic acid. In vitro experiments further confirmed that CGA-induced ferroptosis in HCC cells was related to mitochondrial damage through the reprogramming of arachidonic acid metabolism by regulating the PTGS2/AKR1C3/GPX4 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that CGA inhibits HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inducing ferroptosis through the PTGS2/AKR1C3/GPX4 axis, suggesting its potential as a novel ferroptosis inducer or anti-HCC drug."

      "abstract": "Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a key phenolic acid found in coffee, fruits, vegetables, and herbs, has significant pharmacological activities, necessitating its accurate detection in complex matrices. In this study, an organic acrylate molecularly imprinted polymers-chitosan modified zinc sulphide quantum dots/polydopamine (MIPs-CS:ZnS QDs/PDA) based composite sensor for the detection of CGA has been designed. In MIPs shell, CGA served as template and 4-vinylpyridine and methacrylic acid as functional monomers, azobisisobutyronitrile acting as the initiator and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the cross-linker. Chitosan was incorporated to enhance the stability of ZnS QDs, while polydopamine was introduced during polymerization to improve adhesion and the selectivity of MIPs for CGA. Under ideal conditions, the composite sensor had shown a linear range of 0.02-11 μg/mL with detection limit of 8.9 × 10-3 μg/mL. The composite sensor showed imprinting factor of 6.3, and response time of 12 min. The sensor demonstrated good selectivity towards CGA, in the presence of interfering agents. Composite sensor was successfully applied to detect CGA in plant extracts, coffee and fruit juices, with recovery ranges from 88.93 to 98.49 %. The MIPs-CS:ZnS QDs/PDA composite sensor offers a simple and robust approach for CGA detection in real samples without requiring pre-treatment.",

This study is therefore designed to assess the effect of acute exposure to CGA. Forty-eight Swiss mice were weight-matched into eight groups (n = 6). Groups I and II received distilled water and 1% ethanol; Groups III-VIII received 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 and 1000 mg/kg doses of CGA, respectively. Twenty-four hours post-treatment, the liver and kidneys were excised and used for antioxidant assays and kidney and liver function tests. Sections were prepared for histology. Results showed that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was significantly elevated at all the doses of CGA in the kidney and also in the liver. The liver function parameters were affected in the liver of mice treated with CGA. CGA variably affected potassium ion concentration at the different doses in the kidney. Results were complemented by the histology. CGA manifests a deleterious effect, as evidenced by the perturbations in some of the biochemical parameters in the liver at all the doses, and in particular from the 240 mg/kg dose.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), recognized globally for their hepatotoxic properties, significantly contribute to liver damage through an imbalance in bile acid homeostasis. Addressing this imbalance is crucial for therapeutic interventions in PA-related liver injuries. Chlorogenic acid (Cga), a phenolic compound derived from medicinal plants, has demonstrated hepato-protective effects across a spectrum of liver disorders. The specific influence and underlying mechanisms by which Cga mitigates PA-induced liver damage have not been clearly defined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To explore the protective effects of Cga against acute PA toxicity, a murine model was established. The influence of Cga on bile acid metabolism was confirmed through a variety of molecular biology techniques. These included RNA sequencing, western blotting, and immunoprecipitation, along with quantitative analyses of bile acid concentrations. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that Cga enhances sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activation and increases farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling, which are crucial for maintaining bile acid balance in PA-induced hepatic injury. When mice subjected to PA-induced hepatic injury were treated with SIRT1 inhibitors alongside Cga, the hepatoprotective effects of Cga were significantly reduced. In Fxr-KO mice, the ability of Cga to mitigate liver damage induced by PAs was substantially reduced, which underscores the role of the SIRT1/FXR signaling axis in mediating the protective effects of Cga. CONCLUSION: Our research suggests that Cga can serve as an effective treatment for PA-mediated hepatotoxicity. It appears that influencing the SIRT1/FXR signaling pathway might provide an innovative pharmacological approach to address liver damage caused by PAs."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of endurance exercise and chlorogenic acid on oxidative and nitrosative stress indicators in skeletal muscle tissue of male C57BL/6 mice. METHODS: A total of 35 mice were randomly divided into two groups: a high-fat diet group to induce pre-diabetes and a normal diet group. After inducing pre-diabetes, mice in the high-fat diet group were further divided into control, chlorogenic acid, endurance training, and endurance training + chlorogenic acid groups (n = 7). The exercise protocol was performed incrementally (speed 15-23 m/min) for 10 weeks (three sessions per week for 45 min) on a treadmill. Chlorogenic acid was administered at a rate of 110 mg/kg of body weight three times a week via gavage. Next, 24 hours after the last intervention, tissue samples were taken from the quadriceps femoris muscles and analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's post-hoc test at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: Endurance training significantly decreased glutathione (P = 0.01) and glutathione peroxidase (P = 0.026). Chlorogenic acid consumption also significantly decreased glutathione peroxidase (P = 0.007) and significantly increased the total antioxidant capacity (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Endurance training and chlorogenic acid supplementation may be used as therapeutic strategies to improve antioxidant capacity and prevent or reduce diabetes-related complications."

      "abstract": "Resistance to apoptosis-inducing drugs frequently occurs in cancer cells, limiting their usefulness in ongoing cancer treatment. Despite ongoing efforts to overcome drug resistance, a definitive solution remains elusive. However, autophagy inhibition has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of some anticancer drugs and is a possible strategy for overcoming drug resistance. In this study, we demonstrate that chlorogenic acid (CGA), a natural antioxidant, significantly enhances beta-lapachone (β-Lap)-induced cell death in cancer cells. The augmented apoptosis induced by CGA is associated with activation of protein kinase A (PKA) in β-Lap-treated cells, independent of the antioxidant properties of CGA. As a result, PKA activation in cancer cells co-treated with β-Lap and CGA effectively inhibits autophagy. Notably, PKA activation leads to phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 1 A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) at the serine 12 residue, causing autophagy suppression irrespective of mTORC activity. Importantly, the cell death induced by β-Lap and CGA in NQO1-overexpressing breast or lung cancers is closely linked to autophagy inhibition. These findings suggest that combining β-Lap and CGA might be a novel strategy for cancer therapy, particularly for overcoming drug resistance caused by autophagy induction in cancer cells.",

Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenolic acid rich in Eucommia ulmoides and other plants with potential neuroprotective effects, effectively enhances learning and memory, and exerts a beneficial impact on improving mood and attention. However, the effects and mechanisms of CGA on PTSD-like behaviors remain uncertain. This study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of CGA on PTSD by using network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking and experimental validation, and try to provide new strategies for the treatment of PTSD. The results indicated that 9 core targets with a strong binding affinity with CGA were screened out, and they were mainly enriched in apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The followed vivo experiments indicated that CGA could alleviate single prolonged stress (SPS)-induced PTSD-like behaviors, and improve hippocampal pathological damage, apoptosis and synaptic plasticity through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by regulating Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways. Thus, CGA may inhibit hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, reduce neuroinflammatory and oxdiative stress response, and enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity through regulating the crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby improving SPS-induced PTSD-like behaviors.",

CHA, a typical phenolic acid, exhibits excellent anticancer, anti-inflammation, and antibacterial properties. Herein, bifunctional nanomicelles (CI@SPK) were skillfully designed to take advantage of the unique properties of Sol and CHA to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hydrophobic Sol was modified with poly(ethylene glycol) to self-assemble into stable nanomicelles (SP). CHA could be encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of these nanomicelles, which increased its bioavailability greatly. Short peptide K (CKLVFFAED) was incorporated (CI@SPK) to facilitate their crossing the blood-brain barrier. Then, CI@SPK targeted the AD lesion area, and CHA was released in greater quantities with the help of IR780 under irradiation with an 808 nm laser, resulting in synergistically scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) with Sol. Consequently, the nanomicelles CI@SPK demonstrated capabilities in scavenging ROS, inhibiting β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, and eventually modulating microglia phenotype from M1 to M2 to promote Aβ phagocytosis and clearance. In vivo studies indicated that nanomicelles CI@SPK improved the learning and cognitive impairments of APP/PS1 mice by reducing Aβ plaque and inflammation, signifying the potential value of CI@SPK in clinical application for AD treatment.",

The role of CGA in protecting pancreas from severe injury in pancreatitis needs to be studied. The intervention with CGA led to a significant decline in serum amylase and lipase levels in rats with SAP, concurrently mitigating the pathological impairment within the pancreatic tissue. CGA effectively diminishes the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in SAP rats by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, in AR42J cells, the application of CGA was found to reduce the inflammatory response induced by caerulein. Mechanically, CGA alleviates the inflammatory response in SAP models by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Together, CGA reduces the inflammatory response of SAP by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, thus alleviating the development of SAP. Our results provide a basis for the treatment of SAP.",

Transcriptome results demonstrated that differential expression genes (DEGs) in the CA-g-CS treated group were concentrated in inorganic ion transport metabolism and outer membrane. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis showed that a large number of significantly down-regulated genes were closely related to iron transport in bacteria. Among them, Tonb-dependent outer membrane protein receptors Fiu, TbpA and FecA of P. fluorescens were significantly down-regulated under CA-g-CS treatment by -5.092, -3.768 and - 3.716 Log2 Fold change. Subsequently, atomic force microscope (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) indicated that CA-g-CS treatment causes membrane surface collapse and reduces the bacterial membrane protein content of P. fluorescens. Moreover, CA-g-CS treatment significantly reduced the adsorption of Fe3+ by P. fluorescens, which decreased the iron (Fe) uptake and intracellular iron (Fe) content by 27.27 % and 37.08 %, respectively, and retarded the growth activity of strain in iron-limiting medium. Overall, CA-g-CS could kill P. fluorescens by inhibiting the transcription of membrane channel proteins and inhibit the transport and uptake of iron (Fe).",

However, whether CGA regulates innate immunity and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we found that CGA increased resistance to Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 in dose dependent manner. Meanwhile, CGA enhanced innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans by reducing intestinal bacterial burden. CGA also inhibited the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Importantly, CGA inhibited the production of Pseudomonas toxin pyocyanin (PYO) to protect C. elegans from P. aeruginosa PA14 infection. Furthermore, CGA activated the UPRmt and expression of antibacterial peptide genes to promote innate immunity in C. elegans via transcription factor ATFS-1(activating transcription factor associated with stress-1). Unexpectedly, CGA enhanced innate immunity independently of other known innate immune pathways. Intriguingly, CGA also protected mice from P. aeruginosa PA14 infection and activated UPRmt.

The degree of binding between the proteins and chlorogenic acids (CQA) can be enhanced by the ultrasound process. Herein, the effects of ultrasound-assisted non-enzymatic covalent binding (the free radical induction (Vc)-ultrasound combination and the alkali treatment (Alkali)-ultrasound combination) of two chlorogenic acids (neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA), cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA)) and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) on proteins structure and properties were investigated. Results showed that ULG-Alkali-4CQA exhibited a 5.1 % reduction in α-helices, a 6.8 % increase in random curl and proteins structures becoming loose and disordered. The hydrophilicity and thermal stability of β-LG were effectively enhanced by the addition of 4-CQA and the effect of alkali treatment-ultrasound combination. Curcumin (CUR) and lycopene (LYC) were successfully delivered by the covalent complexes as delivery vehicles. The encapsulation efficiencies of the ULG-Vc/Alkali-4CQA + CUR and ULG-Vc/Alkali-4CQA + LYC complexes were 82.81 %, 84.16 %, 89.56 % and 90.51 %, respectively. The stabilities of CUR and LYC in the ULG-Vc/Alkali-4CQA + CUR/LYC ternary complexes were superior to those of all the measured complexes delivery systems. The study hopes to establish a theoretical foundation and serve as a reference for the advancement of a highly stable food-grade delivery system.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Olanzapine (Olz) is an effective antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia; however, its use is associated with weight gain and metabolic disorders. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a dietary polyphenol, has a promising potential for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. This study aimed to determine whether CGA could effectively manage Olz-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a rat model, with metformin (Met) as a positive control.Methods: Female Wistar rats were divided into seven groups: control; Olz (5 mg/kg/day, IP); CGA (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day, gavage) plus Olz; Met (100 mg/kg/day, gavage) plus Olz; and CGA (80 mg/kg/day, gavage) for 30 days. Metabolic parameters including body weight, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and blood pressure were assessed. This study focused on evaluating serum levels of leptin and adiponectin, as well as hypothalamic protein expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT2CR), which are known to influence energy balance and potentially play a role in Olz-induced metabolic abnormalities.Results: Olz caused substantial hyperphagia, weight gain, hypertension, and liver damage, along with elevated fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and leptin levels. CGA and Met mitigated these effects, although Olz-induced elevation of adiponectin levels remained unaffected by either treatment. Mechanistically, Olz reduced 5-HT2CR protein levels, a trend that was observed in the CGA and Met therapy groups. Olz also enhanced NPY protein levels and the pAMPK/AMPK ratio while lowering POMC protein levels. These alterations were reversed in rats administered CGA or Met.Discussion: These findings suggest that CGA effectively attenuated the adverse metabolic consequences of Olz by modulating leptin, NPY, POMC, and AMPK protein levels. CGA's therapeutic potential highlights its potential as a dietary intervention for managing antipsychotic-induced metabolic disturbances."

This research examined CA activities in mitigating skin photoaging. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: UV-exposed human skin fibroblast cells were subjected to CA at 6.25, 12.5, and 25 μg/mL. The protein levels of cell secretion, such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, nitric oxide (NO), and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured using ELISA and colorimetry methods. Meanwhile, the mRNA expressions of glutathione peroxidase (GPX)-1, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, caspase (CASP)-3, CASP-8, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 were quantified using the qRT-PCR method. FINDINGS/RESULTS: CA treatment reduced inflammatory and aging biomarkers. CA at 6.25 μg/mL lowered NO, COX-2, and IL-6 levels to 89.44 μmol/L, 8.10 ng/mL, and 62.75 pg/mL, respectively. CA at 25 μg/mL resulted in the most significant down-regulation of MMP-1, CASP-3, and CASP-8 genes' expression (3.27, 1.25, and 3.59, respectively). Furthermore, treatment with CA at 25 µg/mL demonstrated the most notable activity in up-regulating antioxidant markers, specifically GPX-1, and extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity markers, including TIMP-1 and FGF-2 genes' expression. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: CA imposes its anti-aging activity by decreasing inflammatory and aging biomarkers, and increasing cellular antioxidant and ECM integrity."

This study investigates OVRAS's role in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and explores the protective effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA). Female mice were subjected to CUS (10 intervention methods were randomly applied to mice according to low, medium, and high frequency) and CGA treatment. Hormone levels, estrous cycles, ovarian morphology, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were evaluated. Results demonstrated that CUS overactivated the ACE-AngII-AT1R axis, increasing oxidative stress and apoptosis in granulosa cells (GCs). CGA improved ovarian function, reduced oxidative stress, and downregulated ACE-AngII-AT1R axis activity. CGA may alleviate stress-induced DOR by mitigating oxidative stress and apoptosis via modulation of the ACE-AngII-AT1R axis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Despite advances in surgical techniques and treatment regimens, the therapeutic effects of glioma remain unsatisfactory. Immunotherapy has brought new hope to glioma patients, but its therapeutic outcomes are limited by the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME). This study aimed to reveal the subpopulations and functional characteristics of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and explore the regulatory effects of chlorogenic acid (CHA) on the immune microenvironment, as well as its potential for clinical application. METHODS: In this study, CHA was used in model mice. ScRNA - seq analysis was conducted to elucidate the differentiation trajectories and functional characteristics of bone marrow - derived monomacrophages (BMDMs) and microglia. A PPI and molecular docking model were constructed using the target prediction database. A case of a patient treated with CHA was reviewed. RESULTS: CHA slowed tumor growth in model mice and extended the survival time of mice. It enhanced the antigen - presenting function of macrophages and T - cell immune activation - related gene expression, activated microglia through the JAK - STAT pathway, and improved the antitumor functions. The good affinity of CHA with STAT1 was confirmed. The patient treated with CHA survived for 5 years and 6 months, achieved partial remission (PR) after 9 months of treatment, and remained alive without any new symptoms or toxic side effects. Our study revealed the subtypes and differentiation trajectories of TAMs. CHA significantly improved the immune microenvironment of glioma by modulating the function of BMDMs and microglia. DISCUSSION: This study may provide new insights into targeting the regulation of TME and offer theoretical and practical support for the clinical application of CHA. The results demonstrated the potential of CHA in improving the immune microenvironment and antitumor effects, which could have implications for future glioma treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammatory dysregulation play crucial roles in pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), and their cyclic synergy drives excessive inflammatory responses and further exacerbates ALI. Therefore, new effective strategies to treat ALI are urgently needed. Herein, a novel synergistic selenium based chlorogenic acid nanoparticle was developed to disrupt the cyclic synergistic effect between oxidative stress and inflammatory response in ALI. The chlorogenic acid, a polyphenol commonly found in herb, had been effectively conjugated with human serum albumin and coated on selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) to create CHSe NPs. The CHSe NPs exhibited superoxide dismutase(SOD) like and glutathione peroxidase(GPX) like activities, effectively scavenging various types of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inhibited the inflammatory response of macrophages. Additionally, with excellent biosafety, CHSe NPs exhibited superior therapeutic effects in ALI mice models in vivo, surpassing the performance of the clinic drug dexamethasone. They remarkably reduced ROS levels, and elevated the SOD and GPX enzyme activities in lung tissue to exert antioxidant effects. In addition, the CHSe NPs modulated the immune microenvironment of ALI by reversing M1 macrophage polarization, downregulating the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-a), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) levels, thereby alleviating excessive inflammation and decreasing neutrophil infiltration. Further mechanistic research revealed that CHSe NPs directly acted on and modulated the expression of Mapk8ip1 and Itga2b, which were upstream proteins of MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, therefore impeding the cyclic synergy between oxidative stress and inflammatory dysregulation. In summary, CHSe NPs synergistically exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, showing enormous potential in the treatment of ALI.",

OBJECTIVE: Herein, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of chlorogenic acid in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis and explore the autophagy pathway as the possible molecular target of chlorogenic acid. METHODS: Rats were injected with carbon tetrachloride (1ml/kg) to induce liver fibrosis for 10 weeks. In the current study, the liver fibrosis rats were treated daily with chlorogenic acid (20, 40, and 60 mg/kg) for 30 days. Liver function tests, renal function tests, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme, anti-inflammatory NF-κB level, and autophagy pathway parameters (PI3K, AKT, mTOR, LC3, and Beclin-1) were assessed. RESULTS: CCl4 elevated serum AST and ALT activity, and hepatic malondialdehyde, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR expressions. It decreased LC3, Beclin-1 expression, and hepatic glutathione level. The results indicated that chlorogenic acid treatment ameliorated the hepatic functions. It declined serum AST and ALT activities, improved hepatic GSH concentration, decreased lipid peroxidation, and downregulated PI3K, AKT, and mTOR protein expressions in hepatic tissue. Moreover, chlorogenic acid increased the hepatic expression of LC3 and Beclin-1. It also significantly decreased NF-kB expression. CONCLUSION: Chlorogenic acid showed promise in reducing liver damage in rats caused by CCl4 by influencing the autophagy process and adjusting levels of antioxidant and inflammatory markers."

Inflammation reaction mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome and Nrf2-related oxidative stress have been considered to play a very important role in the progress of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Effective drugs for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy still need to be explored. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a kind of polyphenol with a Nrf2 activation property widely existed in nature. The aims of this study were to evaluate the renoprotective effect of CGA and to elucidate the anti-inflammation mechanisms involved. In the present study, we established a diabetic rat model to investigate the renoprotective effect of CGA in vivo. The results show that the level of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urinary protein excretion in diabetic rats were significantly decreased after CGA intervention. CGA administration can active the Nrf2 pathway and inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, Nrf2 siRNA transfection nullified the inhibitory effects of CGA on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro. To summarize, our present study provided evidence that chlorogenic acid can slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy progression, and the effect is associated with suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation via through modulation of the Nrf2 pathway, suggesting its therapeutic implications for diabetic nephropathy.",

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of CGA on inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophage cells and on AR in mice. RAW264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammation and cultured with varying concentrations of CGA, a Tlr4-silenced gene (shTlr4) transfection, and the MAPK/NF-κB pathway activator diprovocim. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK8 assay, while levels of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α, and IL-6 were measured by Griess colorimetry, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. Expression and phosphorylation levels of the MAPK/NF-κB pathway were evaluated using qPCR and western blotting. Additionally, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR mice received different doses of CGA, and Toll-like receptor-4 (Tlr4) overexpression was induced. In vitro, CGA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced cell activity, NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 secretion, and downregulated Tlr4, p-p38, p-p65, and p-IκB expression. Tlr4 inhibition suppressed cell activity and inflammation by blocking MAPK/NF-κB pathway activation. Conversely, Tlr4 overexpression counteracted the effects of CGA, increasing cell activity and inflammatory factor concentration. In OVA-induced AR mice, CGA effectively alleviated allergic symptoms, reduced inflammatory factor secretion, and inhibited TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB pathway activity. These findings suggest CGA's potential as an anti-inflammatory agent in RAW264.7 cells and AR models through modulation of the TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB pathway."

Chlorogenic acid and potential related targets of septic acute liver injury were searched from the public databases. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted. Subsequently, molecular docking was performed to predict the binding of the active compound to the core target. Finally, in vivo experiments were carried out for further validation. A total of 60 common targets were identified between acute septic liver injury and chlorogenic acid, among which 9 common core targets (EGFR, ESR1, GSK3B, PTGS2, TLR4, PPARA, HSP90AA1, ACE, and MMP9) were screened with Cytoscape. Molecular docking indicated that these core targets had good binding activity to chlorogenic acid (- 7.2, - 6.8, - 7.7, - 8.7, - 6.1, - 6.8, - 7.3, - 8.4, and - 8.6 kcal/mol respectively). In the SALI mouse model, chlorogenic acid can improve pathological damage to the liver and apoptosis of liver cells, and anti-inflammatory properties significantly by the TLR4/NF-κB pathway (all P < 0.05). The biological activity and regulatory network of CGA on SALI were revealed, and the anti-inflammatory effect of CGA was verified, which could be associated with the TLR4/NF-κB pathway."

Currently, from the perspective of regulating senescent cells, potent compounds or reliable protein targets that could effectively prevent skin photoaging have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrated that chlorogenic acid (CGA) significantly inhibited UVA-induced senescence of human dermis skin fibroblasts (HDF) cells by screening the natural product library. The activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) result revealed that Enolase 1 (ENO1) is one of the direct targets of CGA in HDF cells. Further mechanism research indicated that CGA covalently binds to ENO1, and prevented UVA-induced cellular senescence by suppressing the activity of ENO1 protein to block the glycolytic pathway. Importantly, we found that CGA dose-dependently reduced the skin wrinkle score, alleviated skin pathological features and inhibited senescent characteristics in a photoaging mouse model. The proteomic analysis revealed that CGA treatment effectively inhibited senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion and glycolysis in skin samples of mice. Collectively, our study not only demonstrated that inhibiting cell senescence is an effective anti-skin photoaging strategy, but also revealed that ENO1 is a promising protein target to prevent photoaging.",

      "abstract": "The functional properties of starch-polyphenol complexes closely related to the digestion process. Here, dynamic in vitro digestion properties and prebiotic activities of lotus seed starch-chlorogenic acid complexes under autoclaving treatment (A-LS-CA) were investigated. The results showed that the ordered structure, thermal stability and molecular weight of the A-LS-CA complexes significantly altered during dynamic in vitro digestion. Remarkably, the ordered structure of digestive products significantly decreased in oral-gastric phase, while the ordered structure was increased in oral-gastric-small intestinal phase. The molecular weight of A-LS-CA complexes decreased gradually in oral, oral-gastric and oral-gastric-small intestinal phase, which were 7.40 ± 0.57, 2.23 ± 0.98 and 0.46 ± 0.10 × 107 g/mol, respectively. In addition, chlorogenic acid was attached to the surface of starch by hydrogen bonding during dynamic in vitro digestion, improving the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid. Interestingly, the dynamically digested A-LS-CA complexes stimulated the proliferation of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and Lacticaseibacillus casei, and promoted to produce acetic acid, which was 1.07-1.49 folds that of the controls. In summary, this study provided a new insight for the structural and functional properties of starch-polyphenol complexes.",

However, the oral co-delivery of RH and CGA faces challenges such as differences in hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, gastrointestinal instability, and inadequate colonic targeting. To address these issues, shell-core nanoparticles were developed for the co-encapsulation of RH and CGA (CP@CGA-FA/TA@RH NPs). These nanoparticles utilize cyclodextrin-based polymers and folate-amantadine polymers to form a supramolecular core that targets macrophages for anti-inflammatory action with RH, while chitosan cross-link to CGA in the outer shell provides microenvironment-sensitive antioxidant release. The results indicate that CP@CGA-FA/TA@RH NPs could effectively inhibit the classical TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway and activate the Nrf2/HO-1-mediated antioxidant pathway, offering a novel approach to UC treatment. Q-value analysis confirms the substantial co-medication effect between RH and CGA. This study is the first to develop a nano-system combining two food-derived ingredients for the integrated treatment of UC.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory colon disorder. Several modern medicines have been used for UC treatment but are associated with side effects. Hence, herbal medicine-inspired lead molecules are promising for managing UC. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), an herbal bioactive, has been reported for anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activity. The current study aimed to develop enteric-coated mucoadhesive beads of CGA for colon targeting. CGA-loaded beads were prepared using chitosan and carrageenan as polymers through an ionic gelation technique. Furthermore, beads were coated with Eudragit S-100. The formulations were characterized by particle size analyzer, ultraviolet (UV)-spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and in vitro drug release study. The optimized formulation (CGA-F2) showed particle size (440.6 ± 6.1 μm), zeta potential (-31.12 ± 2.16 mV), entrapment efficiency (83.56 ± 5.46), %yield (86.87 ± 4.19), and drug loading (1.14 ± 0.09). SEM indicated that the morphologies of CGA-F2 were spherical and ellipsoidal. The FTIR study confirmed the compatibility of the drug with polymers used in the formulations. CGA-F2 exhibited mucoadhesive efficiency (94.33 ± 2.1%) and swelling index (0.98 ± 0.03) at simulated colonic fluid (SCF) pH 7.4 (***p < 0.001) significantly. In an in vitro drug release study, CGA-F2 (95.07 ± 3.85%) showed a sustained drug release profile in SCF (pH 7.4) at 37 ± 0.5°C for 24 h. Optimized formulation exhibited drug release in a sustained manner for 24 h, which may be due to the effect of mucoadhesive and enteric coating polymer. Hence, CGA-loaded beads would be promising for treating the UC.",

This study investigated the bactericidal activity of CGA combined with ultraviolet-A light (UVA, 365 nm) (CGA + UVA) against Escherichia coli DH5α, with the aim of developing novel strategies for food preservation and healthcare. CGA + UVA treatment was superiorin reducing bacterial survival than either treatment alone. At 20 J/cm2 and pH 7, CGA (0.3%) + UVA treatment resulted in only about a 3-log reduction in bacterial survival, whereas at 15 J/cm2 and pH 3, no surviving bacteria could be detected, demostrating that the treatment was more effective at acidic pH. CGA + UVA treatment was also bactericidal in green plum juice, confirming that its low pH-dependent property could be effective in acidic food products. To elucidate the bactericidal mechanism of CGA + UVA treatment, its effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, membrane integrity, and enzyme activity were measured. ROS generated via the type-1 reaction, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH), were mainly detected. CGA + UVA disrupted the bacterial cell membrane, causing the leakage of cellular components, particularly proteins. CGA + UVA treatment also led to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) degradation and reduced succinate-coenzyme Q reductase activity by approximately 72 %. Furthermore, CGA + UVA treatment decreased β-lactamase activity and plasmid transforming efficacy with maximal reductions of 68 % and 98 %, respectively, highlighting its potential for increasing antibiotic susceptibility and preventing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The results demonstrate that CGA + UVA treatment could be used to effectively combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria and prevent the spoilage of preserved foods or food poisoning.",

Three hundred sixty healthy 43-wk-old Hy-Line brown hens were randomly assigned to six treatments: a basal diet + 0 (control and H2O2), 600 (600 mg/kg CGA and 600 mg/kg CGA + H2O2), and 800 (800 mg/kg CGA and 800 mg/kg CGA + H2O2) mg/kg CGA for 84 d. On the 64th and 78th days of the trial, hens in groups H2O2, 600 mg/kg CGA + H2O2, and 800 mg/kg CGA + H2O2 were injected intraperitoneally with 10% H2O2. The results demonstrated that 600 and 800 mg/kg CGA significantly improved the egg production rate (EPR) and egg quality and reduced lipid peroxidation compared to the control group. The 800 mg/kg CGA showed greater improvements in the EPR and average egg weight (AEW) compared to the 600 mg/kg dose. Conversely, H2O2 exposure significantly decreased the EPR, AEW, and egg quality and increased feed conversion rate and average daily feed intake. H2O2 exposure significantly decreased serum T-AOC and increased serum MDA levels while reducing hepatic T-SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT activities. Meanwhile, H2O2 exposure significantly elevated liver reactive oxygen species levels, pathological damage, and NF-κB, TNFα, and IL-1β gene expression. Additionally, H2O2 treatment disrupted hepatocyte mitochondrial structure and significantly increased the expression of VDAC1 protein, and IP3R, GRP75, MCU, Fis1, and MFF genes, while downregulating the expression of MFN2 protein and PGC1α gene. Oil Red O staining demonstrated that H2O2 induced significant lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Concurrently, H2O2 significantly increased serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and liver triglycerides levels while decreasing serum hepatic lipase activity. This was primarily attributed to the significant upregulation of liver SREBP1, FASN, and ACC genes and the downregulation of the liver CPT1 gene induced by H2O2. Furthermore, CGA pretreatment effectively prevented the degeneration in laying performance and egg quality, as well as OS, liver inflammation, pathological damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by H2O2. CGA inhibited H2O2-induced hepatic lipid accumulation by upregulating fatty acid oxidation-related gene expression and downregulating fatty acid synthesis-related gene expression. These findings indicate that the dietary addition of 800 mg/kg of CGA is the optimum supplementation dose. CGA can enhance laying performance and egg quality while alleviating OS, hepatic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid accumulation in H2O2-challenged laying hens."

Modifications in microstructure can lead to changes in the physical and chemical properties of food systems, which in turn may influence the nutritional characteristics and functional activities of the food. Recent studies have shown that, in addition to traditional Chinese medicine compounds, certain natural polysaccharides and polyphenols exhibit significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These compounds are also associated with beneficial therapeutic effects for the prevention and treatment of acute lung injury. The objective of this study was to examine the synergistic antioxidant effects of chlorogenic acid (CA) and Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) in various ratios, along with their combined antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-induced inflammation in rat alveolar macrophages. Using the Combination Index (CI), which quantifies the synergistic or antagonistic effect of two substances, all four combinations showed synergistic antioxidant properties over a range of concentrations by in vitro antioxidant property experiments. However, based on comparing them, the four group ratios exhibited the highest antioxidant activity of the infusion at CA:LBP = 1:7, indicating synergistic interactions (CI < 1). In addition, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the CA-LBP complex were observed to alleviate cellular inflammatory injury by reducing LPS-induced nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production and inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-6."

The interfacial tension (6.92-9.44 mN/m) influenced by the different mixing sequences of WPI, HMP and CA was HMP-CA-WPI > WPI-CA-HMP > WPI-HMP-CA, and the size of emulsions stabilized by HMP-CA-WPI was approximately 10 nm larger than that of the other two. Complexes with mixing sequence of HMP, CA and WPI outperformed in antioxidant properties (Ferric reducing power absorbance 0.43, ABTS∙ radical scavenging activity 66.04 %), lycopene retention rate (after UV irradiation 85.11 %, after thermal treatment 83.15 %), and storage stability of emulsions than those prepared by WPI-HMP-CA and WPI-CA-HMP. Emulsions stabilized by different ternary complexes showed similar free fatty acid release profiles (39.62 %-41.59 %) and lycopene bio-accessibility (28.87 %-29.94 %) during digestion.

We performed in-depth studies on ACAT1/CGA interactions via multiple assays including SPR, ITC, and cryo-EM. Importantly, we demonstrated that CGA impaired cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of tetrameric ACAT1 on Y407 residue through a novel mode of action in vitro and in vivo. Our study highlights the use of AfBPP platforms in uncovering unique druggable modalities accessed by natural products.

Chlorogenic acid, abundant in resources and widely utilized in cancer treatments, has seen limited studies regarding its efficacy against OSCC. This paper investigates chlorogenic acid's mechanism in treating OSCC, aiming to guide the development of novel drugs. The study employed network pharmacology, molecular docking, and survival analysis methods. Network pharmacological analysis revealed chlorogenic acid targets 23 OSCC-related proteins, including ESR1, MMP2, MMP9, SRC, MAPK8, MAPK1, CDC42, ERBB2, ATM, and BRAF. Molecular docking simulations indicated that the primary target exhibits significant binding capacity with chlorogenic acid, with MMP9 associated with tumor migration and angiogenesis standing out. Survival analysis demonstrated that the downregulation of most primary targets correlates with improved survival rates in OSCC patients. Enrichment analysis of therapeutic targets highlighted the pivotal role of MAPK-ERK and MAPK-JNK signaling pathways in chlorogenic acid's efficacy against OSCC. This paper predicts chlorogenic acid's potential targets and proposes its molecular mechanism in treating OSCC, offering a theoretical foundation for its application in OSCC treatment. We used traditional Chinese medicine, a disease pharmacology-related information base, and an analysis platform to predict targets. The Cytoscape 3.9.1 and STING databases were used to address common targets for drugs and diseases, establish networks of protein interaction relationships, and screen core targets. Meastro11.5 was used for molecular docking simulation. R4.2.2 was used for survival analysis and joint target enrichment analysis. Network pharmacological analysis identified chlorogenic acid acting on 23 OSCC targets. Molecular docking simulations revealed a strong binding affinity of chlorogenic acid compounds with these targets, particularly MMP9, essential for tumor migration and angiogenesis. Survival analysis indicated that the downregulation of most core targets was correlated with improved OSCC patient survival. Enrichment analysis of therapeutic targets highlighted the critical roles of the MAPK-ERK and MAPK-JNK signaling pathways in the effectiveness of chlorogenic acid against OSCC.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The primary cause of memory loss is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown that natural compounds like apple cider vinegar (ACV) have anti-Alzheimer's capabilities. Essential components of ACV, such as gallic acid and chlorogenic acid, may be in charge of the drug's pharmacological effects. METHODS: Using molecular docking and dynamics (MD), the current work looks at the aspect of ACV that protects against AD. To study the conformational relationships and interaction mechanisms between two biological molecules (such as interactions between proteins and drugs or between proteins), MD simulation is frequently used. MD can help understand molecular structural differences between proteins and small compounds. We used acetylcholinesterase (AChE, PDB ID: 1UT6) to MD chlorogenic and gallic acids, as well as the currently prescribed medication rivastigmine (Standard medication). Furthermore, we determine the binding affinity, which may be responsible for AChE inhibition. MD simulations were performed on docked complexes of chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, and rivastigmine with receptor 1UT6 for a 300 ns trajectory to ensure the stability of docked ligand-protein complexes. RESULTS: The results showed that chlorogenic acid has the highest binding affinity and stability for AChE inhibition. In the docking and dynamics analysis, both techniques have predicted chlorogenic acid to be a potential constituent of ACV which shows a similar activity when compared to rivastigmine by virtue of binding affinity. CONCLUSION: These findings identify chlorogenic acid as the key component of ACV that protects against AD-related cognitive and behavioral impairments. This finding will be critical in the development of ACV-based drugs for Alzheimer's disease treatment.",

At the end of the study, kidney biomarkers, oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes, the oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1) and its downstream gene expression, sperm count, gonadotropin hormones, and the structure of the kidney, epididymis, and seminal vesicle were evaluated in response to PM exposure and CGA treatment in all groups. The data obtained from the current study showed that PM exposure led to kidney dysfunction and inhibition of oligospermia through oxidative stress, as evidenced by an increase in MDA and a decrease in TAC, SOD, CAT, and GSH concentration levels in blood samples. These results were consistent with the down-regulation of OXR1, Nrf2, and P21 gene expression. In contrast, CGA improved urogenital biomarkers and histopathology structures of the kidney, epididymis, and seminal vesicle by enhancing antioxidant defense system enzymes and modulating the OXR1 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that environmental air pollution contributes to kidney dysfunction and urogenital damage. Modulation of oxidative stress through the OXR1, P21, and Nrf2 signaling pathways may be the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, chlorogenic acid supplementation could be recommended as a new protective or treatment strategy to safeguard urogenital function against exposure to particulate matter.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental impressions are essential for accurately capturing the detailed anatomy of teeth and surrounding oral structures. However, these impressions often become contaminated with saliva and blood, making proper disinfection necessary. The application of chemical disinfectants has been associated with negative side effects, leading to suboptimal disinfection practices in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of chlorogenic acid (CA) as a disinfectant for alginate impression materials, the impact of CA disinfection on the physical properties and dimensional accuracy of alginate impressions was also investigated. METHODS: The physical properties of alginate impression materials, such as elastic recovery, strain-in-compression, initial setting time, and fluidity, were assessed after mixing the alginate impression materials with three different concentrations of CA solution (10 mg/mL, 15 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL). To evaluate the antimicrobial effect of CA, alginate impressions mixed with a 10 mg/mL CA solution and impressions mixed with distilled water (control group) were contaminated with four types of microorganism: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Following a five-minute incubation period, a CA solution at a concentration of either 50 mg/mL, 55 mg/mL, or 60 mg/mL was sprayed on the samples for disinfection. Samples were collected at different time intervals (10 min, 20 min, 30 min) and cultured to determine the number of colony-forming units (CFU/mL), providing insight into the antimicrobial efficacy of these CA solutions. The dimensional accuracy of alginate impressions was assessed in three groups: one with alginate impressions mixed with distilled water, another with alginate impressions sterilized with available chlorine (2,000 mg/L) mixed with distilled water, and the last group consisting of alginate impressions mixed with 10 mg/mL CA solution and sprayed with 60 mg/mL CA solution. Both the standard model and the plaster model underwent 3D scanning, and the data were processed and compared by software. The root mean square (RMS) was used as a parameter to evaluate the deviation between models. RESULTS: All alginate impression materials mixed with either 10 mg/mL, 15 mg/mL, or 20 mg/mL concentrations of CA solution met the ISO 21563 standard for elastic recovery, strain-in-compression, and fluidity. However, only the material mixed with a concentration of 10 mg/mL CA had an initial setting time within the range specified by the T-6505 Japanese industrial standard. The application of CA solution by mixing or spraying showed significant antimicrobial effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. There was no significant difference in the dimensional accuracy of the alginate impressions between the group of the CA solution applied, the blank group, or the chlorine intervention group.",

This research was performed to explore the protective effects of Chlorogenic acid (CGA) on reproductive damage induced by CP in mice. METHODS: Blood samples were collected for analysis of hormone content subsequently; semen samples were evaluated for quality, and testis samples were used for histopathological evaluation and analysis of oxidative stress biomarkers, protein and gene expression levels of steroid regulatory factors, and steroid synthase. RESULTS: The results noted that CGA increased serum testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) activity; increased SOD, GPx, and GSH oxidative stress levels in testis tissue; and decreased MDA content in testis tissue. Testicular cells in the CGA treatment group gradually returned to normal morphology, and CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 levels increased after CGA treatment. The mRNA levels of CYP11A1, CYP17A1, StAR, 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD were significantly raised in the CGA dose group. In the test dose range, CGA can improve sperm quality, quantitative abnormality, and serum T synthesis disorder caused by CP. This mechanism may be correlated with the inhibition of oxidative stress and antioxidation levels. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, CGA has a protective impact on testicular injuries arising from CP in mice."

      "abstract": "Coffee drinking has been associated with benefits for various health outcomes, with many attributed to the most prevalent family of polyphenols within coffee, chlorogenic acids (CGA). Whilst reviews of the association between coffee and cognition exist, evidence exploring effects of coffee-specific CGA on cognition has yet to be systematically synthesised. The purpose was to systematically review the current literature investigating the relationship between CGA from coffee and cognitive performance. A further objective was to undertake a meta-analysis of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT). Observational and intervention studies were included if they considered coffee-based CGA consumption in human participants and applied a standardised measure of cognition. Furthermore, intervention studies were required to define the CGA content and include a control group/placebo. Studies were excluded if they examined CGA alone as an extract or supplement. A search of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and PsycINFO resulted in including twenty-three papers, six of which were interventions. The evidence from the broader systematic review suggests that CGA from coffee may need to be consumed chronically over a sustained period to produce cognitive benefits. However, the meta-analysis of RCT showed no benefits of coffee CGA intake on cognitive function (d = 0.00, 95% CI -0.05, 0.05). Overall, this review included a limited number of studies, the sample sizes were small, and a wide range of cognitive measures have been utilised. This indicates that further, good-quality interventions and RCT are required to systematically explore the conditions under which coffee CGA may provide benefits for cognitive outcomes.",

CGA can inhibits various cancer types, but its effectivity against tongue cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we utilized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in conjunction with hydrogel-embedded drug sensitivity tests (HDST) to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of CGA on tongue cancer tissues in both in vivo and ex vivo experimental paradigms. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and TUNEL staining revealed that CGA downregulated the expression of CD31 and Ki-67, while concurrently promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, the involvement of the EGFR-AKT-MMP9 signaling cascade in the tumor-suppressive effects of CGA was confirmed using network pharmacology analysis and immunofluorescent validation techniques. Overall, our findings indicate that CGA robustly inhibits tongue cancer in cellular and organismal models. The EGFR-AKT-MMP9 axis plays a highly significant role in mediating this bioactivity, thereby positioning CGA as a promising candidate for further investigation in oncology. The multifaceted therapeutic potential of CGA, as evidenced by its ability to disrupt angiogenesis, suppress cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis, underscores its value as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of tongue cancer."

However, the direct formulation for treatment is severely limited by its low water solubility, poor bioavailability, low plasma stability, and side effects caused by high doses. Fortunately, nanotechnology is widely applied for drug delivery to overcome the partial disadvantages of traditional drug molecules or naturally active components. The properties of CGA containing multiple hydroxyl groups as a green reductant and stabilizer have made the development of CGA-loaded nanomaterials possible. In this review, recent advancements in the design of CGA-loaded nanomaterials based on organic or inorganic nanomaterials were discussed, and the positive effects of nanomaterials on the release properties of active molecules and their targeted distribution in biological systems were indicated. These nanomaterials enhance the physiological activity of CGA in the treatment of various diseases. Moreover, in the field of food, CGA-loaded nanocomposites have been found to optimize the mechanical properties of nano-food packaging, leading to an extended shelf life of food products. The findings of this review provide a valuable foundation and reference for the development of novel CGA-loaded nanomedicines and nano-food packaging."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung condition, the cause of which remains unknown and for which no effective therapeutic treatment is currently available. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a natural polyphenolic compound found in different plants and foods, has emerged as a promising agent due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifibrotic properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of CGA in IPF remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze the pharmacological impact and underlying mechanisms of CGA in IPF. MAIN METHODS: Using network pharmacology analysis, genes associated with IPF and potential molecular targets of CGA were identified through specialized databases, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Molecular docking was performed to accurately select potential therapeutic targets. To investigate the effects of CGA on lung histology and key gene expression, a murine model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis was used. KEY FINDINGS: Network pharmacology analysis identified 384 were overlapped between CGA and IPF. Key targets including AKT1, TP53, JUN, CASP3, BCL2, MMP9, NFKB1, EGFR, HIF1A, and IL1B were identified. Pathway analysis suggested the involvement of cancer, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory processes. Molecular docking confirmed the stable binding between CGA and targets. CGA regulated the expression mRNA of EGFR, MMP9, AKT1, BCL2 and IL1B and attenuated pulmonary fibrosis in the mouse model. SIGNIFICANCE: CGA is a promising multi-target therapeutic agent for IPF, which is supported by its efficacy in reducing fibrosis through the modulation of key pathways. This evidence provides a basis to further investigate CGA as an IPF potential treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chlorogenic acid (CGA) has been identified to possess salient anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer attributes. However, its application is limited by its instability and low bioavailability. Liposomes have been considered effective pharmaceutical delivery vehicles due to their ability to continuously release loaded drugs, improve drug stability, and display good biocompatibility. They can be easily modified by other small molecules to acquire additional biological functions. In this study, we developed and characterized folic acid-TPGS-modified chlorogenic acid liposome (FTCLP) and evaluated its anti-inflammatory activity. METHODS: The successful encapsulation of CGA within FTCLP was confirmed through examination using electron microscopy, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The in vitro release characteristics of FTCLP were evaluated using the dialysis bag membrane method. Meanwhile, a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced colitis model was employed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of FTCLP and its mechanism. RESULTS: The FTCLP exhibited an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 84.85 ± 1.20% and a drug loading (DL) of 11.67 ± 0.04%. The particle size of FTCLP was determined to be 150.63 ± 0.71 nm, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.198 ± 0.02 and a zeta potential of 2.61 ± 0.38 mV. The in vitro release profile followed the Higuchi model, indicating sustained-release characteristics. The in vivo study demonstrated that FTCLP treatment was effective in improving the symptoms of DSS-induced inflammatory response, as evidenced by mitigation of weight loss, reduction in the disease activity index (DAI) score, restoration of colon length, and attenuation of colon tissue damage. Furthermore, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma (INF-γ), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were markedly diminished in both the serum and colon tissue. FTCLP was also observed to suppress the expression of INF-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65, while concomitantly upregulating the expression of Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Besides, the administration of FTCLP was found to result in an increase in the abundance of Lactobacillaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae, while decreasing the abundance of Bacteroidaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Helicobacteraceae. CONCLUSION: Following encapsulation of CGA within liposomes, FTCLP revealed favorable stability and sustained release properties, and enhanced the anti-inflammatory effects by modulating multiple inflammation-related biomarkers. FTCLP has the potential to be a safe and effective drug for targeted therapy of colitis."

CGAs was isolated by ionic liquids-ultrasound (IL-UAE), which contains six isomers of chlorogenic acid with total purity of 95.69%. The thrombopoietic effect and mechanism of CGAs were investigated using in silico prediction and experimental validation. The changes of HEL cells morphology in volume and the increase in the total cell percentage of polyploid cells indicated that CGAs could promote megakaryocyte differentiation. Meanwhile, CGAs could promote platelet formation in a murine model of ITP, which was established by injection of antiplatelet antibody. Further quantitative proteomics analysis and Western blot verification revealed that CGAs could activate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which confirmed the mechanism prediction. It suggested that CGAs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy that relies on the PI3K/AKT pathway to facilitate megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production."

Here, the impact of chlorogenic acid on the multi-scale structure and digestive properties of lotus seed starch under autoclaving treatment were evaluated in this study. The results showed that lotus seed starch granules were destroyed under autoclaving treatment, and chlorogenic acid promoted the formation of loose gel structure of lotus seed starch. In particular, the long- and short-range ordered structure of lotus seed starch-chlorogenic acid complexes were reduced compared with lotus seed starch under autoclaving treatment. The relative crystallinity of A-LS-CA complexes decreased from 23.4 % to 20.3 %, the value of R1047/1022 reduced from 0.87 to 0.80, and the proportion of amorphous region increased from 10.26 % to 13.85 %. In addition, thermal stability, storage modulus and loss modulus of lotus seed starch-chlorogenic acid complexes were reduced, indicating that the viscoelasticity of lotus seed starch gel was weakened with the addition of chlorogenic acid. It is remarkable that chlorogenic acid increased the proportion of resistant starch from 58.25 ± 1.43 % to 63.85 ± 0.96 % compared with lotus seed starch under autoclaving treatment.

      "abstract": "The onset and progression of ulcerative colitis (UC) are intricately linked to the worsening of intestinal inflammation, an imbalance in oxidative stress, and impairment of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Although chlorogenic acid (CA) shows potential in effectively alleviating the symptoms of UC, its clinical application is hindered by its poor bioavailability, stability, rapid metabolism, and quick excretion. This study utilized a one-step enzyme-catalyzed polymerization technique to create chlorogenic acid nanoparticles (CA NPs), aiming to improve the bioavailability and stability of CA. The CA NPs exhibited an optimal nanosize (106.65 ± 4.12 nm) and showed increased cellular uptake over time. Importantly, CA NPs significantly prolonged retention time in inflamed colonic tissues, enhancing accumulation and providing a targeted therapy for UC. Animal studies confirmed the substantial benefits of CA NPs, including reduced weight loss, lessened reduction in colon length, and a lowered disease activity index (DAI) score in DSS-induced UC mice. Moreover, CA NPs effectively reduced oxidative stress and levels of inflammatory factors in the colonic tissues of UC mice, thus mitigating tissue damage and restoring the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. In conclusion, our research proposes a novel approach to increase the bioavailability and stability of CA, offering a promising avenue for its effective application in preventing UC.",

Therefore, a series of chlorogenic acid-apigenin (CA) conjugates with varying linkers were designed and synthesized as dual XOD/NLRP3 inhibitors, and their activities both in XOD and NLRP3 inhibition were evaluated. An in vitro study of XOD inhibitory activity revealed that the majority of CA conjugates exhibited favorable XOD inhibitory activity. Particularly, the effects of compounds 10c and 10d, with an alkyl linker on the apigenin moiety, were stronger than that of allopurinol. The selected CA conjugates also demonstrated a favorable anti-inflammatory activity in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, compound 10d, which showed the optimal activity both in XOD inhibition and anti-inflammatory, was chosen and its inhibitory ability on NLRP3 and related proinflammatory cytokines was further tested. Compound 10d effectively reduced NLRP3 expression and the secretion of interluekin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) with an activity stronger than the positive control isoliquiritigenin (ISL). Based on these findings, compound 10d exhibits dual XOD/NLRP3 inhibitory activity and, therefore, the therapeutic effects on acute gout is worthy of further study.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a phenolic acid produced by the interaction of Caffeic acid and Quinic acid, is considered to be the main active ingredient in many heat-clearing and detoxifying Chinese medicines, such as honeysuckle, Houttuynia, Artemisia annua, Gardenia, etc. CGA has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial and other properties. However, the effect and process of CGA in kidney fibrosis remain unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the therapeutic effects of CGA on alleviating kidney fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mouse kidney fibrosis model was established by unilateral uretera obstruction (UUO), followed by treatment with CGA (40, 80 mg/kg/d) for 10 days. The serum and kidney tissue were collected. Network pharmacology, molecular docking and transcriptomic analysis were conducted to explore the possible mechanisms. The HK-2 cells were cultured and treated with TGF-β1(10 ng/mL) and CGA (50, 100 μM), to examine the role of TLR4/NF-қB signaling pathway in the therapeutic effect of CGA on kidney fibrosis. RESULTS: CGA significantly alleviated kidney injury, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis in UUO models. CGA also effectively inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors and the process of oxidative stress both in vivo and in vitro fibrosis models. Further, transcriptomic analysis, molecular docking, and network pharmacology results indicated that the therapeutic effect of CGA on fibrosis was through the regulation of TLR4/NF-қB signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: CGA might provide benefits for the regulation of inflammatory response, oxidative stress and fibrogenesis by modulating TLR4/NF-қB signaling pathway on kidney fibrosis. Hence, CGA is an attractive agent for treating kidney fibrosis. The present study provided a basis for further research on the therapeutic strategies of kidney fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of high-intensity ultrasound (HIU) treatment on the physiochemical, conformational, and immunomodulatory activity of the OVT-CA complex, emphasizing the structure-function relationship. HIU treatment reduced particle size, improved dispersion, and increased electronegativity of the complex. It facilitated binding between OVT and CA, achieving a maximum degree of 45.22 mg/g CA grafting and reducing interaction time from 2 h to 15 min. HIU-induced cavitation and shear promoted the exposure of -SH and unfolding of OVT, leading to increased surface hydrophobicity of the complex and transformation of its structure from β-sheet to α-helix. Additionally, CA binds to OVT in the C-lobe region, and HIU treatment modulates the intermolecular forces governing the complex formation, particularly by reinforcing hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and introducing electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, HIU treatment increased the immunomodulatory activity of the complex, which was attributed to complex structural changes facilitating enhanced cell membrane affinity, antigen recognition, and B-cell epitope availability. Hierarchical cluster and Pearson correlation analysis confirmed that HIU treatment duration had a greater impact than power on both the structure and activity of the complex, and an optimal HIU treatment duration within 30 min was found to be crucial for activity enhancement. Moreover, structural changes, including ζ-potential, particle size/turbidity, and surface hydrophobicity, were closely correlated with immunomodulatory activity. This study highlights the potential application of HIU in developing protein-polyphenol immunomodulatory agents for public health and food nutrition.",

Epileptic animals received CGA (200 mg/kg) or sodium valproate (standard antiepileptic agent, 200 mg/kg) for four weeks. Results revealed that pre-administration of CGA significantly reversed the behavioral changes following pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection. Further, CGA pre-treatment caused significant increases in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, along with marked increases in dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin levels. Additionally, the increased antioxidant enzymes activities, along with higher glutathione (GSH) contents and upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene expression, were indicative of a notable improvement in the cellular antioxidant defense in mice treated with CGA. These results were associated with lowered malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels. Moreover, epileptic mice that received CGA showed significant declines in the content of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), besides downregulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Remarkably, CGA counteracted hippocampal apoptosis by lessening the levels of pro-apoptotic biomarkers [Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase-3] and increasing the anti-apoptogenic marker level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). The hippocampal histopathological findings corroborated the abovementioned changes. In sum, these findings suggest that CGA could mediate the neuroprotective effect against PTZ-induced epilepsy via modulation of neurotransmitters, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. CGA, therefore, could be considered a valuable antiepileptic therapeutic supplement.",

For this reason, in this study, different concentrations (10, 50, and 100 mg L-1) of chlorogenic acid (ChA) were assayed to evaluate its effectiveness in maintaining fruit quality traits and mitigating CI symptoms in tomatoes. Our results showed that ChA treatments effectively delayed weight loss and maintained fruit firmness, with optimal results observed at 50 mg L-1. In general, higher concentrations did not result in significant quality improvements. Additionally, ChA-treated tomatoes exhibited reduced values in malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage (EL), indicating improved membrane integrity and reduced oxidative damage. ChA treatments also maintained a higher total phenolic content (TPC) during storage, with significant levels of individual polyphenols such as rutin, neochlorogenic acid, and p-coumaric acid, suggesting enhanced antioxidant capacity and better preservation of fruit quality. This is the first time the potential of ChA to reduce CI has been evaluated in any fruit species, and its impact in tomato ripening is shown to uphold fruit quality during cold storage, prolonging the storability of tomatoes. In particular, we highlight its natural origin and effectiveness as a postharvest treatment."

METHODS: A sample size of thirty male Sprague Dawley Albino rats weighing between 100 and 150 g (5-6 weeks old) was randomly allocated into 3 equal groups. Group I: rats were used as controls and were given phosphate buffer solution, whereas Group II: rats were given an 80 mg/kg sodium nitrites (SN) daily dissolved in distilled water. The rats in Group III were given a daily dose of 80 mg/kg SN dissolved in distilled water and after 6 hours each rat received 50 mg/mL freshly prepared chlorogenic acid (CGA) every other day. For 12 weeks, all treatment modalities will be administered orally, every day. After the experiment, all rats were euthanized. Samples from salivary glands and livers were processed and stained with H&E and interleukin 6 (IL 6). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes were detected using an ELISA assay. RESULTS: Groups III had nearly comparable findings to Group I regarding histological pattern with normal submandibular glands and livers features. Group III salivary gland treated with CGA exhibited higher SOD levels (20.60±4.81 U/g) in comparison to the SN group, and lower MDA levels (111.58±28.28 nmol/mg) in comparison to the SN treated samples. In comparison to the SN group, CGA treatment significantly reduced MDA levels in liver samples (167.56±21.17 nmol/mg) and raised SOD (30.85±6.77 U/g). CONCLUSIONS: Chlorogenic acid has a protective effect against salivary gland and liver toxicity induced by SN in rats. This was mediated via the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of CGA and the restoration of oxidant/antioxidant balance in rat salivary gland and liver.",

Its complexity, which is evident at the genetic and phenotypic levels, contributes to its diversity and resistance to treatment. Numerous scientific investigations on human and animal models demonstrate the potential of phytochemicals in cancer prevention. Coffee has been shown to possess potent anti-carcinogenic properties, and studies have documented the consumption of coffee as a beverage reduces the risk of cancer occurrence. The major secondary metabolites of coffee, named caffeine and chlorogenic acid, have been linked to anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic effects through various signaling. In light of this, this review article provides a comprehensive analysis based on studies in anticancer effects of coffee, chlorogenic acid, and caffeine published between 2010 and 2023, sourced from Scopus, Pubmed, and Google Scholar databases.

The ternary complexes were comprehensively evaluated for physicochemical attributes, stability, emulsifying capacities, antioxidant properties, and antimicrobial efficacy. PP-HA binary complexes were first prepared at pH 7, and then CA was bound to the binary complexes, as verified by fluorescence quenching. Molecular docking elucidated that PP interacted with HA and CA through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The particle size of ternary complexes initially decreased, then increased with CA concentration, peaking at 0.025%. Ternary complexes demonstrated good stability against UV light and thermal treatment. Emulsifying activity of complexes initially decreased and then increased, with a turning point of 0.025%, while emulsion stability continued to increase. Complexes exhibited potent scavenging ability against free radicals and iron ions, intensifying with higher CA concentrations. Ternary complexes effectively inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, with inhibition up to 0.025%, then decreasing with CA concentration. Our study indicated that the prepared ternary complexes at pH 7 were stable and possessed good functionality, including emulsifying properties, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial properties under certain concentrations of CA. These findings may provide valuable insights for the targeted design and application of protein-polysaccharide-polyphenol complexes in beverages and dairy products."

Consequently, prompt treatment of burn wounds is imperative, with oxidative stress and excessive inflammation identified as primary factors contributing to delayed healing. In recent years, there has been growing interest in in situ crosslinked multifunctional hydrogels as a minimally invasive approach for personalized treatment delivery. To address these, a photocrosslinkable methacryloyl hyaluronic acid hydrogel scaffold embedded with chlorogenic acid/carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles (CGA/CMCS-HAMA, CCH), was developed for the treatment of burn wounds. The hydrogel prepared degraded by over 50 % by day 20, demonstrating stability and meeting the therapeutic requirements for burn wounds. Leveraging the extracellular matrix-like properties of HAMA and the antioxidant capabilities of CGA/CMCS NPs, this hydrogel demonstrates the ability to locally and continuously scavenge ROS and inhibit lipid peroxidation, inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, hydrogels well modulate the expression of macrophage- and fibroblast-associated inflammatory factors. Additionally, the hydrogel promotes cell adhesion and migration, further supporting the healing process. Overall, this innovative approach offers a safe and promising solution for burn wound treatment, addressing drug breakthrough and safety concerns while being adaptable to various irregular wound types.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, Varicocele (VC) has been recognized as a common cause of male infertility that can be treated by surgery or drugs. How to reduce the damage of VC to testicular spermatogenic function has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Among them, overexpressed ROS and high levels of inflammation may play a key role in VC-induced testicular damage. As the key mediated innate immune pathways, cGAS-STING shaft under pathological conditions, such as in cell and tissue damage stress can be cytoplasmic DNA activation, induce the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory corpuscle, triggering downstream of the inflammatory cascade reaction. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), as a natural compound from a wide range of sources, has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, and is a potential effective drug for the treatment of varicocele infertility. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of CGA in the spermatogenic dysfunction of the rat testis induced by VC and the potential mechanisms. The results of this study have shown that CGA gavage treatment ameliorated the pathological damage of seminiferous tubules, increased the number of sperm in the lumen, and increased the expression levels of Occludin and ZO-1, which indicated the therapeutic effect of CGA on spermatogenic dysfunction in the testis of VC rats. Meanwhile, the damage of mitochondrial structure was alleviated and the expression levels of ROS, NLRP3 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18) were significantly reduced in the testicular tissues of model rats after CGA treatment. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time the high expression status of cGAS and STING in testicular tissues of VC model rats, and this was ameliorated to varying degrees after CGA treatment. In conclusion, this study suggests that CGA can improve the spermatogenic function of the testis by reducing mitochondrial damage and inhibiting the activation of the cGAS-STING axis, inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and improving the inflammatory damage of the testis, highlighting the potential of CGA as a therapeutic agent for varicocele infertility.",

      "abstract": "Chlorogenic acid (CGA) has demonstrated anti-tumor effects across various cancers, but its role in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains unclear. Our study revealed CGA's potent anti-tumor effects on CCA, significantly suppressing cell proliferation, migration, colony formation, and invasion while inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CGA induced apoptosis, modulated cell cycle progression, and exhibited a stable binding affinity to AKR1B10 in CCA. AKR1B10 was highly expressed in RBE cells, and CGA treatment reduced AKR1B10 expression. Knocking out AKR1B10 inhibited the proliferation of RBE cells, whereas the overexpression of AKR1B10 promoted their proliferation. Additionally, CGA suppressed the proliferation of RBE cells with AKR1B10 overexpression. Mechanistically, AKR1B10 activated AKT, and CGA exerted its inhibitory effect by reducing AKR1B10 levels, thereby suppressing AKT activation. Furthermore, CGA facilitated the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages towards an anti-tumor phenotype and enhanced T-cell cytotoxicity. These findings underscore CGA's potential as a promising therapeutic agent for CCA treatment."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease is a degenerative neurological condition which leads to a decline in memory and cognitive function. Chlorogenic Acid (CGA) presents properties including neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of CGA on cognitive impairments, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in mice submitted to an experimental model of Sporadic Alzheimer Disease (SAD) induced by intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ). Male Swiss mice received bilateral ICV-STZ injections (3 mg/Kg) on days 1 and 3. The treatment with CGA (5 mg/Kg, orally) or vehicle (water, orally), was initiated and continued for 26 days, starting 2 h after the second induction procedure. At first, there was no change in serum glucose levels after SAD induction. ICV-STZ induces impairments in aversive, recognition, and spatial memory, while CGA treatment significantly alleviated these memory deficits. Furthermore, locomotor activity, working memory, and anxiety-related activities remained unaffected by the treatments. CGA treatment protects against ICV-STZ-induced increase in the nitrite/nitrate and TBARS levels. ICV-STZ induced a reduction in viable cells, depletion of BDNF, and triggered astrogliosis and microgliosis in the cortex and hippocampus. Treatment with CGA preserves viable cell count in the prefrontal cortex, CA1, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Additionally, it prevented BDNF depletion in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG regions), and mitigated astrogliosis and microgliosis in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG regions). These findings indicate the neuroprotective effects of CGA, underscoring their potential as therapeutic agents or adjuncts in the treatment of SAD.",

      "abstract": "Successful bone regeneration requires close cooperation between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and macrophages, but the low osteogenic differentiation efficiency of stem cells and the excessive inflammatory response of immune cells hinder the development of bone repair. It is necessary to develop a strategy that simultaneously regulates the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and the anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages for accelerating the bone regeneration. Herein, calcium-chlorogenic acid nanoparticles (Ca-CGA NPs) are synthesized by combining the small molecules of chlorogenic acid (CGA) with Ca2+. Ca-CGA NPs internalized by cells can be dissolved to release free CGA and Ca2+ under low pH conditions in lysosomes. In vitro results demonstrate that Ca-CGA NPs can not only enhance the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs but also promote the phenotype transformation of macrophages from M1 to M2. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirm that Ca-CGA NPs treatment facilitates the recovery of rat skull defect model through both osteoinduction and immunomodulation. This study develops a new Ca-CGA NPs-based strategy to induce the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts and the polarization of macrophages into M2 phenotype, which is promising for accelerating bone repair.",

Results indicated that treatment with sub-concentrations of CS-g-CA for P. fluorescens led to reduce the biofilm size of large colonies, decrease the content of biofilm and extracellular polymers, weaken the motility and adhesion of P. fluorescens. Moreover, CS-g-CA resulted in higher ROS levels, diminished catalase activity (CAT), and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in P. fluorescens. CS-g-CA reduced the production of quorum-sensing signaling molecules (AHLs) and the concentration of c-di-GMP in bacteria. Genes for flagellar synthesis (flgA), the resistance to stress (rpoS and hfq), and pde (phosphodiesterases that degrade c-di-GMP) were significantly down-regulated as determined by RT-PCR. Overall, CS-g-CA leads to the accumulation of ROS in bacteria via P. fluorescens environmental resistance genes and decreases the activity of enzymes in the bacterial antioxidant system, and interferes with the production and reception of quorum-sensing signaling molecules and the synthesis of c-di-GMP in P. fluorescens, which regulates the generation of biofilms.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic drugs are indispensable in cancer treatment, but their effectiveness is often lessened because of non-selective toxicity to healthy tissues, which triggers inflammatory pathways that are harmful to vital organs. In addition, tumors' resistance to drugs causes failures in treatment. Chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid, CGA), found in plants and vegetables, is promising in anticancer mechanisms. In vitro and animal studies have indicated that CGA can overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics and alleviate chemotherapy-induced toxicity by scavenging free radicals effectively. This review is a summary of current information about CGA, including its natural sources, biosynthesis, metabolism, toxicology, role in combatting chemoresistance, and protective effects against chemotherapy-induced toxicity. It also emphasizes the potential of CGA as a pharmacological adjuvant in cancer treatment with drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, regorafenib, and radiotherapy. By analyzing more than 140 papers from PubMed, Google Scholar, and SciFinder, we hope to find the therapeutic potential of CGA in improving cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic immune disorder marked by synovitis, bone damage, and cartilage erosion, leading to increased socio-economic burdens and reduced quality of life. Despite its unknown cause, advancements in understanding its pathophysiology have facilitated novel therapeutic approaches. Current treatments, including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics, often result in low efficacy and unnecessary side effects. To address the limitations of these drugs, carrier-based drug delivery systems, such as nanomicelles, have emerged as a promising solution. In this study, nanomicelles were synthesised utilizing PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) as a backbone; this backbone is conjugated with chlorogenic acid (CGA), which is known for suppressing inflammation, and incorporates methotrexate (MTX), a model drug that is established for RA treatment. The nanomicelles were extensively characterized in terms of size, charge, drug loading, and drug-release behaviour. The in vivo assessment of MTX-PLGA-b-CGA nanomicelles in a collagen-induced arthritis model demonstrated a remarkable reduction in joint swelling, cartilage erosion, and disease severity. Furthermore, histological findings confirmed cartilage integrity and reduced expression of key pro-inflammatory markers, including receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). The approach based on the MTX-PLGA-b-CGA nanomicelles presents a biocompatible and potentially effective therapeutic strategy for management of the severity and progression of RA, providing a hopeful alternative for RA treatment.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic chronic wounds are notoriously difficult to heal as a result of their susceptibility to infection. To address this issue, we constructed an innovated and adaptable solution in the form of injectable chitosan (CS) hydrogel, denoted as CCOD, with enhanced antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. This hydrogel is created through a Schiff base reaction that combines chitosan-grafted chlorogenic acid (CS-CGA) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) with deferoxamine (DFO) as a model drug. The combination of CS and CGA has demonstrated excellent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, while grafting played a pivotal role in making these positive effects stable. These unique features make it possible to customize injectable hydrogel and fit any wound shape, allowing for more effective and personalized treatment of complex bacterial infections. Furthermore, the hydrogel system is not only effective against inflammation and bacterial infections but also possesses antioxidant and angiogenic abilities, making it an ideal solution for the repair of chronic wounds that have been previously thought of as unmanageable.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The increasing resistance of R. anatipestifer has posed a significant threat to the poultry industry in recent years. The tet gene is the primary determinant of tetracycline resistance in numerous bacteria, and the enzyme modification gene tet(X) is predominantly detected in tetracycline-resistant R. anatipestifer strains. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of both the standard strain and clinical isolates of R. anatipestifer to doxycycline. And the expression levels of tet(X), tet(A), and tet(O) genes were detected. To assess drug susceptibility, shuttle plasmids were constructed to transfer the tet(X) gene into the standard strain of R. anatipestifer followed by treatment with chlorogenic acid. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results revealed that the minimum inhibitory concentration of doxycycline for the standard strain was 0.25μg/mL, whereas it exceeded 8μg/mL for the clinical isolates. Furthermore, there was a significant upregulation observed in expression levels of tet(X), tet(A), and tet(O) genes among induced strains. Interestingly, when transferring the tet(X) gene into the standard strain, its sensitivity to doxycycline decreased; however, MIC values for chlorogenic acid remained consistent between both standard and drug-resistant strains of R. anatipestifer. Moreover, we made a surprising discovery that screening passage with chlorogenic acid resulted in increased sensitivity of R. anatipestifer to doxycycline. Further analysis demonstrated a reversal in expression trends among three differentially expressed genes within induced drug resistance group after intervention with chlorogenic acid. The main objective behind this study is to investigate both killing effect exerted by chlorogenic acid on drug-resistant R. anatipestifer as well as its regulatory impact on drug resistance genes. This will provide novel insights and theoretical basis towards development of chlorogenic acid as a promising drug for treatment and control of drug resistance in R. anatipestifer."

Herein, the protective effects and mechanisms leading to CGA-induced porcine parthenogenetic activation (PA) in early-stage embryos were investigated. Our results showed that 50 μM CGA treatment during the in vitro culture (IVC) period significantly increased the cleavage and blastocyst formation rates and improved the blastocyst quality of porcine early-stage embryos derived from PAs. Then, genes related to zygotic genome activation (ZGA) were identified and investigated, revealing that CGA can promote ZGA in porcine PA early-stage embryos. Further analysis revealed that CGA treatment during the IVC period decreased the abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the abundance of glutathione and enhanced the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase in porcine PA early-stage embryos. Mitochondrial function analysis revealed that CGA increased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels and upregulated the mitochondrial homeostasis-related gene NRF-1 in porcine PA early-stage embryos. In summary, our results suggest that CGA treatment during the IVC period helps porcine PA early-stage embryos by regulating oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function.",

Structural data revealed that chlorogenic acid (CA)/linoleic acid (LA) functioned through noncovalent interactions to form a more ordered structure and fortify antidigestibility in wheat starch (WS)-CA/LA complexes; the resistant starch (RS) contents of WS-CA, WS-LA, and WS-CA-LA complexes were 23.40 ± 1.56%, 21.25 ± 1.87%, and 35.47 ± 2.16%, respectively. Dietary intervention with WS-CA/LA complexes effectively suppressed detrimental alterations in colon tissue morphology induced by HFD and repaired the gut barrier in ZO-1 and MUC-2 levels. WS-CA/LA complexes could augment gut barrier-promoting microbes including Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, and Muribaculum, accompanied by an increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and elevated expression of SCFA receptors. Moreover, WS-CA/LA complexes modulated secondary bile acid metabolism by decreasing taurochenodeoxycholic, cholic, and deoxycholic acids, leading to the activation of bile acid receptors. Collectively, this study offered guiding significance in the manufacture of functional diets for a weak gut barrier.",

However, the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory effects and underlying mechanisms of these three phenolic compounds on oleic acid (OA)-induced HepG2 cells and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed zebrafish. Lipid accumulation and triacylglycerol levels increased in OA-induced cells, which was attenuated by Chl, Isochl A, and Isochl B. Moreover, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels increased by Chl, Isochl A and Isochl B treatment. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Chl, Isochl A and Isochl B reduced the expression of lipogenesis-related protein, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Moreover, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha gamma (PPARα) was increased by Chl, Isochl A, and Isochl B treatment. In addition, our results indicated that Chl, Isochl A and Isochl B decreased lipid profiles and lipid accumulation in HFD-fed zebrafish. Thus, these findings highlight the potential of Chl, Isochl A, and Isochl B as effective agents for treating or/and ameliorating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",

      "abstract": "Adding polyphenols to improve the absorption of functional proteins has become a hot topic. Chlorogenic acid is a natural plant polyphenol with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Bovine lactoferrin is known for its immunomodulatory, anticancer, antibacterial, and iron-chelating properties. Therefore, the non-covalent binding of chlorogenic acid (CA) and bovine lactoferrin (BLF) with different concentrations under neutral conditions was studied. CA was grafted onto lactoferrin molecules by laccase catalysis, free radical grafting, and alkali treatment. The formation mechanism of non-covalent and covalent complexes of CA-BLF was analyzed by experimental test and theoretical prediction. Compared with the control BLF, the secondary structure of BLF in the non-covalent complex was rearranged and unfolded to provide more active sites, the tertiary structure of the covalent conjugate was changed, and the amino group of the protein participated in the covalent reaction. After adding CA, the covalent conjugates have better functional activity. These lactoferrin-polyphenol couplings can carry various bioactive compounds to create milk-based delivery systems for encapsulation."

C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups: normal control (NC), LPS, LPS + low CGA, and LPS + high CGA. Evaluation methods included cystometrogram (CMG), histopathological, western blot, and immunohistological analysis. In the LPS group, CMG revealed abnormal voiding behavior with increased micturition pressure, voided volume (VV), and decreased voided frequency. Low CGA treatment in LPS mice demonstrated improved micturition pressure and inter-contraction intervals (ICI). However, high CGA treatment exhibited prolonged ICI and increased VV, suggesting potential adverse effects. Histological analysis of LPS-treated mice displayed bladder inflammation and interstitial edema. Low CGA treatment reduced interstitial edema and bladder inflammation, confirmed by Masson's trichrome staining. Western blotting revealed increased cytokeratin 20 (K20) expression in the low CGA group, indicating structural abnormalities in the bladder umbrella layer after LPS administration. In conclusion, low CGA treatment positively impacted voiding behavior and decreased bladder edema and inflammation in the LPS-induced cystitis mice model, suggesting its potential as a supplement for inflammation cystitis prevention. However, high CGA treatment exhibited adverse effects, emphasizing the importance of dosage considerations in therapeutic applications."

Our continuous monitoring over this period revealed a consistent increase in flavonoid levels from the second to the tenth month following the commencement of CGA treatment. This was accompanied by a notable upregulation in the expression of four secondary metabolite-related enzyme genes: LjPAL1, LjPAL2, LjPAL3, and LjISY1. Concurrently, there was a significant enhancement in the total activity of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. The total antioxidant capacity of the plants also showed a marked increase from the third to the seventh month post-treatment initiation, subsequently stabilizing. This increase was also reflected in the elevated activities of key antioxidant enzymes: peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, the treatment notably enhanced various indicators of nutrient growth, such as total protein content, total sugar content, and leaf area. Notably, the relative expression of LjTF1, a kind of BZIP transcription factor gene known for its extensive regulatory effects, showed a significant and sustained increase after the start of exogenous CGA treatment. Subsequent metabolomic analysis revealed significant changes in L. japonica metabolites. Specifically, 172 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) showed a notable increase (Fold > 1), predominantly in pathways related to nutrient metabolism such as carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Notably, some of the highly expressed DEMs (Fold > 4) are key antioxidants and medicinal components in L. japonica. The experimental findings were in alignment with the metabolomics analysis, indicating that exogenous CGA can act as a stimulant for L. japonica. It promotes the significant accumulation of certain secondary metabolites, enhances nutritive growth, and boosts the plant's total antioxidant capacity.

A total of 120 healthy New Zealand weaned rabbits with similar initial body weight, were randomly divided into 3 treatments with 20 replicates per treatment and 2 weaned rabbits per replicate: control (CON) group (rabbits were housed at 25 ± 1°C and fed a basal diet), HS group (rabbits were housed at 35 ± 1°C and fed a basal diet), and HS + CGA group (rabbits were housed at 35 ± 1°C and fed a basal diet supplemented with 800 mg/kg CGA). The trial lasted for 28 days. The results showed that HS challenge decreased (p < 0.05) growth performance, induced oxidative stress and hepatic apoptosis, and caused liver damage in rabbits. However, dietary CGA supplementation increased (p < 0.05) body weight gain and feed efficiency, and enhanced (p < 0.05) antioxidative capacity in serum and liver in HS-challenged rabbits; attenuated HS-induced increases in urea nitrogen (p = 0.03), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.03), aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.01), caspase-8 (p = 0.02), and caspase-3 (p = 0.04) as well as decrease albumin (p = 0.04). Moreover, supplementation with CGA upregulated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway-related genes expressions, including Nrf2 (p = 0.009), HO-1 (p = 0.03) and SOD1 (p = 0.04) in HS-challenged rabbits. Our findings demonstrated that dietary CGA supplementation could alleviate HS-induced decline in growth performance, and protect against HS-induced liver damage partially through enhancing antioxidant capacity via acting Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibiting hepatic apoptosis in rabbits.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a condition marked by sudden, self-sustained, and recurring brain events, showcasing unique electro-clinical and neuropathological phenomena that can alter the structure and functioning of the brain, resulting in diverse manifestations. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be very effective in 30% of patients in controlling seizures. Several factors contribute to this: drug resistance, individual variability, side effects, complexity of epilepsy, incomplete understanding, comorbidities, drug interactions, and no adherence to treatment. Therefore, research into new AEDs is important for several reasons such as improved efficacy, reduced side effects, expanded treatment options, treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, improved safety profiles, targeted therapies, and innovation and progress. Animal models serve as crucial biological tools for comprehending neuronal damage and aiding in the discovery of more effective new AEDs. The utilization of antioxidant agents that act on the central nervous system may serve as a supplementary approach in the secondary prevention of epilepsy, both in laboratory animals and potentially in humans. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a significant compound, widely prevalent in numerous medicinal and food plants, exhibiting an extensive spectrum of biological activities such as neuroprotection, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects, among others. In this research, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of commercially available CGA in Wistar rats submitted to lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model. After 72-h induction of SE, rats received thiopental and were treated for three consecutive days (1st, 2nd, and 3rd doses). Next, brains were collected and studied histologically for viable cells in the hippocampus with staining for cresyl-violet (Nissl staining) and for degenerating cells with Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining. Moreover, to evaluate oxidative stress, the presence of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was quantified. Rats administered with CGA (30 mg/kg) demonstrated a significant decrease of 59% in the number of hippocampal cell loss in the CA3, and of 48% in the hilus layers after SE. A significant reduction of 75% in the cell loss in the CA3, shown by FJC+ staining, was also observed with the administration of CGA (30 mg/kg). Furthermore, significant decreases of 49% in MDA production and 72% in the activity of SOD were seen, when compared to animals subjected to SE that received vehicle. This study introduces a novel finding: the administration of CGA at a dosage of 30 mg/kg effectively reduced oxidative stress induced by lithium-pilocarpine, with its effects lasting until the peak of neural damage 72 h following the onset of SE. Overall, the research and development of new AEDs are essential for advancing epilepsy treatment, improving patient outcomes, and ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals living with epilepsy.",

This study endeavored to elucidate the intervention effect of chlorogenic acid coupled with extruded rice starch (CGA-ES) in mitigating lipid metabolism disorders induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in rats. First, a significant increase in resistant starch (RS) and a decrease in the predicted glycemic index (pGI) were observed in CGA-ES owing to the formation of an ordered structure (Dm, single helix, and V-type crystalline structure) and partly released CGA. Compared to a physical mixture of starch and chlorogenic acid (CGA + S), CGA-ES showed a more potent effect in alleviating lipid metabolism disorders, manifesting as reduced levels of blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP), as well as body weight. It is correlated with an improvement in the gut microecology, featuring bacteria known for cholesterol reduction and butyrate production (Butyricicoccus, Bifidobacterium, Fusicatenibacter, Turicibacter, and Enterorhabdus), along with bile acid, butyrate and PG (PG (17:0/16:0) and PG (18:1/16:0)). The RS fraction of CGA-ES was found to be the main contributor. These findings would provide evidence for future studies to regulate lipid metabolism disorders, and even obesity using CGA-ES.",

Conventional preparations often fail to meet multiple demands and provide prompt information about wound status. Here, a pH/ROS dual-responsive hydrogel (OHA-PP@Z-CA@EGF) was constructed based on oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA), phenylboronic acid-grafted ε-polylysine (PP), chlorogenic acid (CA)-loaded ZIF-8 (Z-CA), and epidermal growth factor (EGF), which possesses intrinsic antibacterial, antioxidant, and angiogenic capacities. Due to the Schiff base and Phenylboronate ester bonds, the hydrogel exhibited excellent mechanical properties, strong adhesion, good biodegradability, high biocompatibility, stable rheological properties, and self-healing ability. Moreover, introducing Z-CA as an initiator and nanofiller led to the additional cross-linking of hydrogel through coordination bonds, which further improved the mechanical properties and antioxidant capabilities. Bleeding models of liver and tail amputations demonstrated rapid hemostatic properties of the hydrogel. Besides, the hydrogel regulated macrophage phenotypes via the NF-κB/JAK-STAT pathways, relieved oxidative stress, promoted cell migration and angiogenesis, and accelerated diabetic wound healing. The hydrogel also enabled real-time monitoring of the wound healing stages by colorimetric detection. This multifunctional hydrogel opens new avenues for the treatment and management of full-thickness diabetic wounds.",

Two such phytochemicals are chlorogenic acid and cinnamaldehyde. Studies have shown their efficacy against different molecular subtypes of breast cancers in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss their current status in anticancer research with specific emphasis on chlorogenic acid and cinnamaldehyde. We describe their multiple mechanisms of action in destroying breast cancer cells, their potential uses, and the need for translational applications. We also include future directions for investigations to progress chlorogenic acid and cinnamaldehyde research from bench to bedside."

After modeling the mice received intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg normal saline (in sham and CLP groups), 1 μg/kg dexamethasone or 15 mg/kg of chlorogenic acid for 6 h delivered using an intravenous pump. Eight hours after the infusion, renal morphology and histology, renal cell apoptosis, and the renal function parameters such as urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Scr), and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) were compared among the 4 groups; the 7-day survival rates of the mice were recorded, and the expressions of NLRP3 inflammasomes and key proteins of the caspase-1 pathway in the renal tissue were detected. RESULTS: CGA treatment significantly improved the 7-day survival rate, reduced renal pathologies of the septic mice (P < 0.05), and lowered the levels of BUN, Scr, KIM-1, NLRP3 inflammasome and expressions of key proteins of the caspase-1 pathway.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chlorogenic acid, the primary active component in Chinese medicines like honeysuckle, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. It has been demonstrated that chlorogenic acid effectively prevents and treats Duck enteritis virus (DEV) infection. This study aims to further elucidate the mechanism by which chlorogenic acid prevents DEV infection. METHODS: Duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells were pre-treated with chlorogenic acid before being infected with DEV. Cell samples were collected at different time points for transcriptomic sequencing, while qPCR was used to detect the proliferation of DEV. Additionally, 30-day-old ducks were treated with chlorogenic acid, and their lymphoid organs were harvested for histopathological sections to observe pathological damage. The proliferation of DEV in the lymphoid organs was also detected using qPCR Based on the transcriptomic sequencing results, NF-κB1 gene was silenced by RNAi technology to analyze the effect of NF-κB1 gene on DEV proliferation. RESULTS: Compared to the viral infection group, DEF cells in the chlorogenic acid intervention group exhibited significantly reduced DEV load (P < 0.05). Transcriptomic sequencing results suggested that chlorogenic acid inhibited DEV proliferation in DEF cells by regulating NF-κB signaling pathway. The results of RNAi silencing suggested that in the three treatment groups, compared with the DEV experimental group, there was no significant difference in the effect of pre-transfection after transfection on DEV proliferation, while both the pre-transfection after transfection and the simultaneous transfection group showed significant inhibition on DEV proliferation Furthermore, compared to the virus infection group, ducks in the chlorogenic acid intervention group showed significantly decreased DEV load in their lymphoid organs (P < 0.05), along with alleviated pathological damage such as nuclear pyretosis and nuclear fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorogenic acid effectively inhibits DEV proliferation in DEF and duck lymphatic organs, mitigates viral-induced pathological damage, and provides a theoretical basis for screening targeted drugs against DEV.",

      "abstract": "Long-term inflammation will develop into chronic inflammation and become inflammatory diseases. Antibiotics are commonly used in clinical practice to treat inflammatory diseases. But patients are prone to drug resistance. So we need to find new treatment. Chlorogenic acid is an organic compound extracted from honeysuckle and other plants. Its anti-inflammatory activity is strong, and it has a significant anti-inflammatory effect on inflammatory diseases in various systems. It has been shown that chlorogenic acid can regulate inflammation-related signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) canonical signaling pathway, NF-κB atypical signaling pathway, nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) canonical signaling pathway, and Nrf2 atypical signaling pathway, etc. It can up-regulate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-13 and down-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Although chlorogenic acid has a strong anti-inflammatory effect, but clinical trials and application still face many difficulties. In the future, the anti-inflammatory molecular mechanism of chlorogenic acid should be further studied to explore its clinical application value and improve new ideas for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a natural phenolic antioxidant, has demonstrated preservative properties in various postharvest products. However, the underlying mechanisms of its application on maintaining quality remain unclear. Therefore, the effect of exogenous CGA treatment on quality deterioration of potato slices and the mechanisms involved were investigated. Results revealed CGA treatment retarded the browning coloration, suppressed microbial growth and inhibited the declines in starch, and ascorbic acid contents in potato slices. Meanwhile, the treatment activated the phenylpropanoid pathway but decreased the activities of phenolic decomposition-related enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and tyrosinase and downregulated StPPO expression. Moreover, the treated slices exhibited reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, they displayed enhanced 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals scavenging capacity and higher ATP levels. Therefore, these findings indicated that CGA treatment was effective for quality maintenance and antioxidant capacity enhancement in fresh-cut potatoes, thereby providing potential strategies for the preservation and processing of fresh-cut produce.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy (CH) is an important characteristic in heart failure development. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a crucial bioactive compound from honeysuckle, is reported to protect against CH. However, its underlying mechanism of action remains incompletely elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanism underlying the protective effect of CGA on CH. This study established a CH model by stimulating AC16 cells with isoproterenol (Iso). The observed significant decrease in cell surface area, evaluated through fluorescence staining, along with the downregulation of CH-related markers, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) at both mRNA and protein levels, provide compelling evidence of the protective effect of CGA against isoproterenol-induced CH. Mechanistically, CGA induced the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) while concurrently attenuating the expression of the core protein β-catenin in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the experiment utilized the Wnt signaling activator IM-12 to observe its ability to modulate the impact of CGA pretreatment on the development of CH. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database combined with online platforms and tools, this study identified Wnt-related genes influenced by CGA in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and further validated the correlation between CGA and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in CH. This result provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of CGA against CH, indicating CGA as a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of heart diseases.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can eventually lead to neuronal death. Thioredoxin is a small reductase protein that acts as an eliminator of ROS and protects neurons from brain damage. Chlorogenic acid is known as a phenolic compound that has a neuroprotective effect. We investigated the change of thioredoxin expression by chlorogenic acid in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model. Adult rats were injected intraperitoneally with phosphate buffered saline or chlorogenic acid (30 mg/kg) 2 h after MCAO. MCAO damage induced neurological defects and increased ROS and lipid peroxidation levels, however, chlorogenic acid mitigated these changes. MCAO damage reduced thioredoxin expression, which was mitigated by chlorogenic acid treatment. The interaction between thioredoxin and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) was decreased in MCAO animals, chlorogenic acid treatment prevented this decrease. In cultured neurons, chlorogenic acid dose-dependently attenuated glutamate-induced decreases in cell viability and thioredoxin expression. Glutamate toxicity downregulated bcl-2 and upregulated bax, cytochrome c, and caspase-3, however, chlorogenic acid attenuated these changes. The mitigating effect of chlorogenic acid was lower in thioredoxin siRNA-transfected cells than in non-transfected cells. These results provide evidence that chlorogenic acid exerts potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects through regulation of thioredoxin and modulation of ASK1 and thioredoxin binding in ischemic brain injury. These findings indicate that chlorogenic acid exerts a neuroprotective effect by regulating thioredoxin expression in cerebral ischemia and glutamate exposure conditions.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Cardiac hypertrophy, an adaptive response of the heart to stress overload, is closely associated with heart failure and sudden cardiac death. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA) on cardiac hypertrophy and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: To simulate cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial cells were exposed to isoproterenol (ISO, 10 μM). A rat model of ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy was also established. The expression levels of cardiac hypertrophy markers, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) markers, and apoptosis markers were measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blotting. The apoptosis level, size of myocardial cells, and heart tissue pathological changes were determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling staining, immunofluorescence staining, haematoxylin and eosin staining, and Masson's staining. We found that CGA treatment decreased the size of ISO-treated H9c2 cells. Moreover, CGA inhibited ISO-induced up-regulation of cardiac hypertrophy markers (atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and β-myosin heavy chain), ERS markers (C/EBP homologous protein, glucose regulatory protein 78, and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), and apoptosis markers (bax and cleaved caspase-12/9/3) but increased the expression of anti-apoptosis marker bcl-2 in a dose-dependent way (0, 10, 50, and 100 μM). Knockdown of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1pr1) reversed the protective effect of CGA on cardiac hypertrophy, ERS, and apoptosis in vitro (P < 0.05). CGA also restored ISO-induced inhibition on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signalling in H9c2 cells, while S1pr1 knockdown abolished these CGA-induced effects (P < 0.05). CGA (90 mg/kg/day, for six consecutive days) protected rats against cardiac hypertrophy in vivo (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CGA treatment attenuated ISO-induced ERS and cardiac hypertrophy by activating the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway via modulation of S1pr1.",

The grafting efficiency was as follows: conventional method < microwave < ultrasound < UM. The UM technique manifested the highest CA-binding capacity (80.26 μmol/g myosin) through covalent bonding, and a much shorter time was required for conjugation than conventional method. The conjugation of polyphenol significantly increased the solubility of myosin with reduced aggregation behavior, which was accompanied by structural alterations from ordered structures (α-helix and β-sheet) to disordered forms. The emulsion stabilized by UM-myosin-CA conjugate exhibited the most homogeneous microstructure with favorable creaming stability. Moreover, the resulting emulsion presented strong oxidation resistance and storage stability. These results illustrate the promising potential of employing CA-grafted myosin, especially when processed using the UM technique, in the development of highly efficient emulsifiers."

Our results revealed that CA, rather than HHP, effectively reduced tropomyosin's allergenicity, as evident in the alleviation of allergic symptoms in a food allergy mouse model. Spectroscopy and molecular docking analyses demonstrated that CA could reduce the allergenicity of tropomyosin by covalent or non-covalent binding, altering its secondary structure (2.1 % decrease in α-helix; 1.9 % increase in β-fold) and masking tropomyosin's linear epitopes. Moreover, CA-treated tropomyosin potentially induced milder allergic reactions by up-regulating TLR8. While our results supported the efficacy of CA in alleviating crayfish allergy, further exploration is needed to determine clinical effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a multifactorial disorder of the large intestine, especially the colon, and has become a challenge globally. Allopathic medicines are primarily available for the treatment and prevention of UC. However, their uses are limited due to several side effects. Hence, an alternative therapy is of utmost importance in this regard. Herbal medicines are considered safe and effective for managing human health problems. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), the herbal-derived bioactive, has been reported for pharmacological effects like antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, anticancer, etc. This review aims to understand the antiinflammatory and chemopreventive potential of CGA against UC. Apart from its excellent therapeutic potential, it has been associated with low absorption and poor oral bioavailability. In this context, colon-specific novel drug delivery systems (NDDS)are pioneering to overcome these problems. The pertinent literature was compiled from a thorough search on various databases such as ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, etc., utilizing numerous keywords, including ulcerative colitis, herbal drugs, CGA, pharmacological activities, mechanism of actions, nanoformulations, clinical updates, and many others. Relevant publications accessed till now were chosen, whereas non-relevant papers, unpublished data, and non-original articles were excluded. The present review comprises recent studies on pharmacological activities and novel drug delivery systems of CGA for managing UC.

Although chemical disinfectants have been effective in reducing number of bacteria, they do have limitations. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the potential of chlorogenic acid, a natural substance with broadspectrum antibacterial properties, for treating DUWLs. Over a period of three months, we analyzed the microbial communities in 149 DUWLs samples collected from 5 dental units using high-throughput pyrophosphate sequencing. RESULTS: The results revealed that chlorogenic acid treatment had a significant impact on the microbial community profile in the DUWLs, with the most significant changes occurring within the first 15 days and stabilization observed in the last 30 days. The predominant genera detected in the samples were Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Methylobacterium, and Phreatobacter. Additionally, the relative abundance of certain beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Roseburia, and Blautia, increased, while the presence of opportunistic pathogens like Mycobacteria significantly decreased. The functional prediction analysis using the KEGG database indicated a decrease in the pathogenicity of the bacterial community in the DUWLs following chlorogenic acid treatment.

A total of 600 fish were selected and randomly divided into five treatment groups and fed with CGA containing 0 mg/kg (CK), 100 mg/kg (L100), 200 mg/kg (L200), 400 mg/kg (L400) and 800 mg/kg (L800) for 56 days. The results of the experiment were as follows: addition of CGA significantly increased the WGR, SGR, FER, and PER of common carp (P < 0.05). The addition of 400-800 mg/kg of CGA significantly increased the serum levels of LZM, AKP activity, C3 and C4 concentration, and increased immune function of common carp (P < 0.05). Regarding antioxidant enzyme activities, adding CGA significantly increased SOD, CAT, and GsH-Px activities, while decreasing MDA content (P < 0.05). Compared with the CK group, the mRNA expression levels of NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β were decreased. The IL-10 and TGF-β were increased in the liver and intestines of the CGA supplemented group. Meanwhile, the addition of CGA also significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, SOD, CAT, and GPX (P < 0.05). CGA also positively contributed to the development of the carp intestinal tract, as demonstrated by decreased serum levels of DAO, D-LA, and ET-1. And the mucosal fold height was increased significantly with increasing levels of CGA. In conclusion, the addition of CGA in the feed can enhance the growth performance, immune function and antioxidant capacity of common carp, and improve the health of the intestine and liver. According to the results of this experiment, the optimal addition amount in common carp diets was 400 mg/kg.",

This study constructed a biomimetic dietary fiber (BDF) model by combining bacterial cellulose (BC) and pectin with CA and investigated the digestive behavior of CA in BDF. Additionally, the study examined the interaction and synergistic effects of polysaccharides and CA against oxidation. Results showed that BDF and natural dietary fiber had similar microstructures, group properties, and crystallization properties, and polysaccharides in BDF were bound to CA. After simulated gastrointestinal digestion, 41.03% of the CA existed in a conjugated form, and it was possibly influenced by the interaction between polysaccharides and CA. And the release of CA during simulated digestion potentially involved four mechanisms, including the disintegration of polysaccharide-CA complex, the dissolution of pectin, escape from BC-pectin (BCP) network structure, and diffusion release. And polysaccharides and CA may be combined through noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals force, or electrostatic interaction force. Meanwhile, polysaccharides-CA combination had a synergistic antioxidant effect by the results of free-radical scavenging experiments, it was probably related to the interaction between polysaccharides and CA. The completion of this work has a positive significance for the development of dietary intervention strategies for oxidative damage.",

      "abstract": "Hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ) is an oxidative component produced by roasting coffee beans and has been reported to generate relatively large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we used senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice to determine whether HHQ consumption increases oxidative-stress-induced injury, because in SAMP8 mice, the activity of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1, which repairs oxidative modifications in DNA, is decreased. The results showed that two out of twelve (16.7%) HHQ-treated mice presented polyuria and glucosuria around 2 months after the start of treatment, indicating that HHQ may act as a mutagen against SAMP8 mice, which is sensitive to oxidative damage. No abnormalities were observed in the chlorogenic acid (coffee polyphenol, CPP)-treated group. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the serum of SAMP8 mice was significantly higher than that in SAMR1 (senescence-resistant) control mice, and the concentration was further increased in the HHQ-treated group. CPP, when coexisting with HHQ at the rate contained in roasted coffee, decreased the amount of hydrogen peroxide in the serum of SAMP8 mice. Although CPP can act both oxidatively and antioxidatively as a polyphenol, CPP acts more antioxidatively when coexisting with HHQ. Thus, the oxidative effect of HHQ was shown to be counteracted by CPP.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotics are commonly used in clinical practice to treat bacterial infections. Due to the abuse of antibiotics, the emergence of drug-resistant strains, such as cefotaxime sodium-resistant Escherichia coli (CSR-EC), has aggravated the treatment of diseases caused by bacterial infections in the clinic. Therefore, discovering new drug candidates with unique mechanisms of action is imperative. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is an active component of Yinhua Pinggan Granule, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. We chose the CGA to explore its effects on PANoptosis in cultured macrophages infected with CSR-EC. In this study, we explored the protective impact of CGA on macrophage cell damage generated by CSR-EC infection and the potential molecular mechanistic consequences of post-infection therapy with CGA on the PANoptosis pathway. Our findings demonstrated that during CSR-EC-induced macrophage infection, CGA dramatically increased cell survival. CGA can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine expression of IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and IL-6. CGA decreased ROS generation and increased Nrf-2 expression at the gene and protein levels to lessen the cell damage and death brought on by CSR-EC infection. Additionally, we discovered that the proteins Caspase-3, Caspase-7, Caspase-8, Caspase-1, GSDMD, NLRP-3, RIPK-3, and MLKL were all inhibited by CGA. In summary, our research suggests that CGA is a contender for reducing lesions brought on by CSR-EC infections and that it can work in concert with antibiotics to treat CSR-EC infections clinically. However, further research on its mechanism of action is still needed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Obesity and overweight are challenging health problems of the millennium that lead to diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and atherosclerosis. Green coffee bean exhibited significant promise in healthy weight management, potentiating glucose-insulin sensitization and supporting liver health. The safety and efficacy of a novel, patented water-soluble green coffee bean extract (GCB70® enriched in 70% total chlorogenic acid and <1% caffeine) was investigated in 105 participants for 12 consecutive weeks. An institutional review board and Drugs Controller General (India) (DCGI) approvals were obtained, and the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. METHOD: Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, lipid profile, plasma leptin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and total blood chemistry were assessed over a period of 12 weeks of treatment. Safety was affirmed. RESULTS: GCB70 (500 mg BID) supplementation significantly reduced body weight (approximately 6%; p = 0.000**) in approximately 97% of the study population. About a 5.65% statistically significant reduction (p = 0.000**) in BMI was observed in 96% of the study volunteers. Waist circumference was significantly reduced by 6.77% and 6.62% in 98% of the male and female participants, respectively. Plasma leptin levels decreased by 13.6% in 99% of the study population as compared to the baseline value. Upon completion of 12 weeks' treatment, fasting glucose levels decreased by 13.05% (p = 0.000**) in 79% of the study population. There was a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c levels in both male and female participants (p = 0.000**), while 86.7% of the study participants showed a statistically significant decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (p = 0.000**). The mean decrease in TSH levels on completion of the treatment was 14.07% in the study population as compared to baseline levels. Total blood chemistry analysis exhibited broad-spectrum safety. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation demonstrated that GCB70 is safe and efficacious in healthy weight management.",
