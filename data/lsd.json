      "abstract": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is gaining renewed interest as a potential treatment for anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder, with clinical trials reporting significant symptom reductions and long-lasting effects. LSD modulates serotonin (5-HT2A) receptors, which, in turn, influence dysfunctional brain networks involved in emotional processing and cognition. It has also shown promise in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, where mystical-type experiences are linked to improved psychological well-being. This review examines LSD's pharmacokinetics, neurobiological mechanisms, and safety considerations, including cardiovascular risks, emotional vulnerability, and the potential for hallucinogen-persisting perception disorder (HPPD). Challenges such as small sample sizes, variable dosing protocols, and regulatory restrictions limit large-scale trials. Future research should focus on standardization, pharmacogenetic influences, and personalized treatment strategies to ensure its safe and effective integration into clinical practice."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Microdosing psychedelics, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), has gained attention for its potential benefits in several psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, LSD's efficacy in reducing ADHD symptoms remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of repeated low doses of LSD in reducing ADHD symptoms compared with placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2A randomized clinical trial conducted between December 17, 2021, and December 4, 2023. Data were analyzed from March 22, 2024, to August 19, 2024. Outpatient treatment was provided at 2 centers: University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, and Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Adults aged 18 to 65 years with a prior ADHD diagnosis who presented with moderate to severe symptoms (Adult Investigator Symptom Rating Scale [AISRS] score ≥26 and Clinical Global Impression Severity score ≥4) were eligible for inclusion. Key exclusion criteria included selected current major psychiatric or somatic disorders and the use of potentially interacting medications. INTERVENTION: Participants received either LSD (20 μg) or placebo twice weekly for 6 weeks (total of 12 doses). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in ADHD symptoms from baseline to week 6, assessed by the AISRS and analyzed with a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. RESULTS: A total of 53 participants were randomized to LSD (n = 27) or placebo (n = 26). Mean (SD) participant age was 37 (12) years, and 22 participants (42%) were female. The LSD group presented a mean AISRS improvement of -7.1 points (95% CI, -10.1 to -4.0). The placebo group presented a mean AISRS improvement of -8.9 points (95% CI, -12.0 to -5.8), with no difference between groups. LSD was physically safe and psychologically well tolerated overall. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, repeated low-dose LSD administration was safe in an outpatient setting, but it was not more efficacious than placebo in reducing ADHD symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05200936."

      "abstract": "Psychedelics, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are being investigated for the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders, for which concomitant treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is prevalent. The present study investigated the acute response to single doses of LSD (100 μg) after daily administration of paroxetine (10 mg for 7 days, followed by 20 mg for 35 days) or placebo (42 days) using a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design in 23 healthy participants. Paroxetine did not alter pleasant subjective effects of LSD but significantly reduced \"bad drug effect,\" \"anxiety,\" and \"nausea.\" No differences in autonomic effects or QTc interval after LSD administration were found between both conditions. The strong cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitor paroxetine led to higher maximal concentrations and total exposures of LSD (geometric mean ratios of 1.4 and 1.5, respectively) indicating relevant involvement of CYP2D6 in its metabolism. The extent of this inhibition was nominally highest in genetic CYP2D6 normal metabolizers and lowest in poor metabolizers. The present findings suggest that add-on treatment with LSD to an SSRI is well-tolerated. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions indicate that no dose adjustment of LSD seems necessary in the presence of an SSRI that inhibits CYP2D6. For SSRIs that do not relevantly inhibit CYP2D6, a dose increase of LSD might be appropriate, but due to lacking data and potential other pharmacokinetic interactions with these compounds, no definitive dose recommendation can be made."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent legislative initiatives in the United States have focused on the medical and legal status of psychedelics, prompting interest in understanding public perceptions of their risks. This study investigates rural-urban differences in the perception of LSD and cannabis risks using national survey data. METHODS: Data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) between 2015 and 2021 were analyzed. Logistic regression models were used to compare risk perceptions of LSD and cannabis between rural and urban respondents, adjusting for relevant factors. RESULTS: Rural residents were 1.2 to 1.4 times more likely to perceive using LSD once or twice as of great risk compared to urban residents during the survey period. However, the perception of monthly cannabis use as having great risk was slightly higher among rural residents only until 2019, with no significant differences observed in 2020 and 2021. CONCLUSION: The study highlights a significant rural-urban divide in the perception of LSD risk, which could impact policymaking on psychedelic therapies. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing effective and equitable policies regarding psychedelic substances and treatments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) poses a significant global health burden with available treatments limited by inconsistent efficacy and notable side effects. Classic psychedelics, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), have garnered attention for their potential in treating psychiatric disorders. Microdosing, the repeated consumption of sub-hallucinogenic doses of psychedelics, has emerged as a self-treatment approach for depression within lay communities. Building upon preliminary evidence and the successful completion of an open-label pilot trial of microdosing LSD for depression (LSDDEP1), this protocol outlines a phase 2b randomised controlled trial (LSDDEP2). The main objective of LSDDEP2 is to assess the modification of depressive symptoms, measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), following a regimen of LSD microdoses versus placebo. METHODS: This is a randomised, double-dummy, triple-blind, active placebo-controlled, parallel groups trial of LSD microdosing in patients meeting DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder. Participants will undergo an 8-week LSD microdosing regimen using the titratable MB-22001 formulation taking two doses a week. All doses will be self-administered at home and will be titratable from 4 to 20 μg based on subjective perception and tolerability. In addition to depression symptoms, outcome will include psychiatric and personality inventories, sleep and activity tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), blood biomarkers, semi-structured interviews, and safety (e.g. adverse event, laboratory exam) measures. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first randomised controlled trial to administer controlled microdoses of LSD for treatment of MDD in participants' naturalistic environment. The measures included are designed to assess the drug's safety, mechanism, and treatment efficacy over placebo in this population. The results of this study will be important for assessing the viability of psychedelic microdosing as an additional treatment option and for informing the direction of future clinical trials.

AIMS: We investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-assisted therapy in patients with anxiety with or without life-threatening illness. METHOD: This study was an a priori-planned long-term follow-up of an investigator-initiated, two-centre trial that used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, random-order, crossover design with two sessions with either oral LSD (200 μg) or placebo per period. Participants (n = 39) were followed up 1 year after the end-of-study visit to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression and long-term effects of psychedelics using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Global (STAI-G), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Persisting Effects Questionnaire and measures of personality traits using the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory. RESULTS: Participants reported a sustained reduction of STAI-G scores compared with baseline (least square means (95% CI) = -21.6 (-32.7, -10.4), d = 1.04, P < 0.001, for those who received LSD in the first period (94 weeks after the last LSD treatment) and -16.5 (-26.2, -6.8), d = 1.02, P < 0.05, for those who received LSD in the second period (68 weeks after the last LSD treatment)). Similar effects were observed for comorbid depression with change from baseline BDI scores of -8.1 (-13.2, -3.1), d = 0.71, P < 0.01, and -8.9 (-12.9, -4.9), d = 1.21, P < 0.01, for the LSD-first and placebo-first groups, respectively. Personality trait neuroticism decreased (P < 0.0001) and trait extraversion increased (P < 0.01) compared with study inclusion. Individuals attributed positive long-term effects to the psychedelic experience. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported sustained long-term effects of LSD-assisted therapy for anxiety.",

      "abstract": "The repeated use of small doses of psychedelics (also referred to as \"microdosing\") to facilitate benefits in mental health, cognition, and mood is a trending practice. Placebo-controlled studies however have largely failed to demonstrate strong benefits, possibly because of large inter-individual response variability. The current study tested the hypothesis that effects of low doses of LSD on arousal, attention and memory depend on an individual's cognitive state at baseline. Healthy participants (N = 53) were randomly assigned to receive repeated doses of LSD (15 mcg) or placebo on 4 occasions divided over 2 weeks. Each treatment condition also consisted of a baseline and a 1-week follow-up visit. Neurophysiological measures of arousal (resting state EEG), pre-attentive processing (auditory oddball task), and perceptual learning and memory (visual long-term potentiation (LTP) paradigm) were assessed at baseline, dosing session 1 and 4, and follow-up. LSD produced stimulatory effects as reflected by a reduction in resting state EEG delta, theta, and alpha power, and enhanced pre-attentive processing during the acute dosing sessions. LSD also blunted the induction of LTP on dosing session 4. Stimulatory effects of LSD were strongest in individuals with low arousal and attention at baseline, while inhibitory effects were strongest in high memory performers at baseline. Decrements in delta EEG power and enhanced pre-attentive processing in the LSD treatment condition were still present during the 1-week follow-up. The current study demonstrates across three cognitive domains, that acute responses to low doses of LSD depend on the baseline state and provides some support for LSD induced neuroadaptations that sustain beyond treatment.",

She had no personal or family history of seizure, brain injury or other neurological disorder. The patient had a history of monthly LSD use on several occasions in the setting of ongoing fluoxetine and longacting bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) treatment, with seizures occurring only after initiation of lithium. Although the definitive causal link cannot be established, this case report suggests an increased seizure risk with combination of LSD and lithium, even at subtherapeutic serum lithium levels. This case emphasizes the need for further research, careful clinical practice, and patient education regarding the potential dangers of using psychedelic substances with psychopharmacological treatment.",

      "abstract": "Lysergic acid diethylamide is a hallucinogen with complex neurobiological and behavioural effects. This is the first study to use MRI to follow functional changes in brain activity in response to different doses of lysergic acid diethylamide in fully awake, drug-naive rats. We hypothesized that lysergic acid diethylamide would show a dose-dependent increase in activity in the prefrontal cortex and thalamus while decreasing hippocampal activity. Female and male rats were given intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or lysergic acid diethylamide in doses of 10 or 100 µg/kg while fully awake during the imaging session. Changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal were recorded over a 30-min window. Approximately 45-min post-injection data for resting-state functional connectivity were collected. All data were registered to rat 3D MRI atlas with 173 brain regions providing site-specific increases and decreases in global brain activity and changes in functional connectivity. Treatment with lysergic acid diethylamide resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in negative blood oxygen level-dependent signal. The areas most affected were the primary olfactory system, prefrontal cortex, thalamus and hippocampus. This was observed in both the number of voxels affected in these brains regions and the changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal over time. However, there was a significant increase in functional connectivity between the thalamus and somatosensory cortex and the cerebellar nuclei and the surrounding brainstem areas. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was an acute dose-dependent increase in negative blood oxygen level-dependent signal that can be interpreted as a decrease in brain activity, a finding that agrees with much of the behavioural data from preclinical studies. The enhanced connectivity between thalamus and sensorimotor cortices is consistent with the human literature looking at lysergic acid diethylamide treatments in healthy human volunteers. The unexpected finding that lysergic acid diethylamide enhances connectivity to the cerebellar nuclei raises an interesting question concerning the role of this brain region in the psychotomimetic effects of hallucinogens."

METHODS: This study utilised 2018 Global Drug Survey data collected from 6 November 2017 to 10 January 2018. Participants who initiated LSD use in the preceding 12 months answered questions on their experiences, social settings, harm-reduction behaviours, and demographics. Descriptive statistics were employed, and characteristics of those seeking emergency medical treatment (EMT) and those not planning further LSD use were compared with other respondents. RESULTS: Among 3340 respondents who used LSD in the past year, their first-time experiences generally exceeded expectations, with 97.7% expressing excitement. Adverse and unwanted side effects were rarely reported, and only 17 individuals needed EMT. Feelings of fear were reported by most (64.1%), but only very mildly and not enough to put them off from wanting to use LSD again. DISCUSSION: Although the occurrence of unwanted side effects seems low and the LSD experience is generally pleasurable, vigilance amid the rising illicit use of LSD through harm-reduction education is still important in preventing possible risks.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electrophysiologic measures provide an opportunity to inform mechanistic models and possibly biomarker prediction of response. Serotonergic psychedelics (SPs) (i.e., psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)) and ketamine represent new investigational and established treatments in mood disorders respectively. There is a need to better characterize the mechanism of action of these agents. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review investigating the spectral signatures of psilocybin, LSD, and ketamine in persons with major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and healthy controls. RESULTS: Ketamine and SPs are associated with increased theta power in persons with depression. Ketamine and SPs are also associated with decreased spectral power in the alpha, beta and delta bands in healthy controls and persons with depression. When administered with SPs, theta power was increased in persons with MDD when administered with SPs. Ketamine is associated with increased gamma band power in both healthy controls and persons with MDD. LIMITATIONS: The studies included in our review were heterogeneous in their patient population, exposure, dosing of treatment and devices used to evaluate EEG and MEG signatures. Our results were extracted entirely from persons who were either healthy volunteers or persons with MDD or TRD. CONCLUSIONS: Extant literature evaluating EEG and MEG spectral signatures indicate that ketamine and SPs have reproducible effects in keeping with disease models of network connectivity. Future research vistas should evaluate whether observed spectral signatures can guide further discovery of therapeutics within the psychedelic and dissociative classes of agents, and its prediction capability in persons treated for depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a hallucinogenic agent. In the mid-20th century, it was used to augment psychoanalysis and to treat alcohol use disorder. However, LSD was banned in 1970 in part because of concerns that it could bring about or exacerbate mental illness. Its therapeutic potential remains incompletely understood. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: While uncontrolled recreational use of LSD can, in rare instances, lead to long-term psychosis, adverse events in clinical trials of LSD, such as anxiety, headache, and nausea, have almost always been mild and transient. Serious adverse events, such as intense panic, suicidal ideation, and psychosis, were reported in either none or very few of the participants. However, patient selection criteria, optimal dosing strategy, and appropriate clinical follow-up guidelines remain to be established. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Preliminary data suggest that LSD may be effective for the management of alcohol use disorder, anxiety, and depression. In trials of LSD for treating anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening illnesses, 77% of participants demonstrate durable relief at 1 year post-treatment. Top-line data from a large-scale phase IIb trial (n = 198) indicate that 50% of participants experience remission from generalized anxiety disorder after a single 100 μg dose of LSD. According to a meta-analysis of RCTs on LSD from the mid-20th century, single-dose regimens of LSD significantly improve alcohol use disorder (P < 0.0003) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.96. LIMITATIONS: Only one large-scale clinical trial (>50 participants) has been conducted on LSD in the contemporary era of psychedelic research. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore potential clinical applications. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that LSD may be one of the most potent treatments for anxiety in patients both with and without a life-threatening illness. LSD may also be beneficial for treating depression and substance use disorders.",

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a popular model organism in medical sciences and are used to examine the repeated administration of pharmacological compounds. Previous zebrafish research found acute LSD altered behaviour and cortisol levels at high (250 µg/L) but not low (5-100 µg/L) levels. In this study, we used a motion tracking system to record and analyze the movement patterns of zebrafish after acute and repeated 10-day LSD exposure (1.5 µg/L, 15 µg/L, 150 µg/L) and after seven days of withdrawal. The open-field and novel object approach tests were used to examine anxiety-like behaviour, boldness, and locomotion. In the acute experiments we observed a significant decrease in high mobility with 1.5 µg/L, 15 µg/L, and 150 µg/L of LSD compared to the control and a decrease in velocity with 1.5 and 15 µg/L. In repeated experiments, there were no significant differences in the levels of anxiety, boldness, or locomotion between all LSD groups and controls immediately after 10-day treatment or after withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, an estimated 260 million people suffer from depression [1], and there is a clear need for the development of new, alternative antidepressant therapies. In light of problems with the tolerability and efficacy of available treatments [2], a global trend is emerging for patients to self-treat depression with microdoses of psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin [3]. Beyond anecdotal reports from those who self-medicate in this way, few clinical trials have evaluated this practice. In our recently published phase 1 study in healthy volunteers [4], we determined that LSD microdosing was relatively safe and well tolerated in that cohort. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that conducting such microdosing trials is broadly feasible, with excellent adherence and compliance to the regimen observed. In this open-label pilot trial of patients with major depressive disorder (LSDDEP1), we will test the tolerability and feasibility of an 8-week regimen of LSD microdosing in this patient group prior to a larger subsequent randomised controlled trial (LSDDEP2). METHODS: Twenty patients meeting the DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder will receive an 8-week LSD microdosing treatment regimen. The treatment protocol will use a sublingual formulation of LSD (MB-22001) delivered twice per week under a titration schedule using a dose of 5-15 µg. Tolerability will be assessed by quantifying the percentage of participants who withdraw from the trial due to adverse events attributable to the treatment regimen, while feasibility will be assessed by quantifying the percentage of attended clinic visits once enrolled. To determine whether there is any antidepressant response to the LSD microdosing regimen, MADRS scores will be assessed at baseline and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the commencement of the regimen. DISCUSSION: The results of LSDDEP1 will provide valuable information regarding the tolerability and feasibility of a proposed LSD microdosing regimen in patients with MDD. Such information is critically important to optimise trial design prior to commencing a subsequent and more resource-intensive randomised controlled trial.

      "abstract": "Cultural awareness of anosmia and microsmia has recently increased due to their association with COVID-19, though treatment for these conditions is limited. A growing body of online media claims that individuals have noticed improvement in anosmia and microsmia following classic psychedelic use. We report what we believe to be the first three cases recorded in the academic literature of improvement in olfactory impairment after psychedelic use. In the first case, a man who developed microsmia after a respiratory infection experienced improvement in smell after the use of 6 g of psilocybin containing mushrooms. In the second case, a woman with anosmia since childhood reported olfactory improvement after ingestion of 100 µg of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). In the third case, a woman with COVID-19-related anosmia reported olfactory improvement after microdosing 0.1 g of psilocybin mushrooms three times. Following a discussion of these cases, we explore potential mechanisms for psychedelic-facilitated improvement in olfactory impairment, including serotonergic effects, increased neuroplasticity, and anti-inflammatory effects. Given the need for novel treatments for olfactory dysfunction, increasing reports describing improvement in these conditions following psychedelic use and potential biological plausibility, we believe that the possible therapeutic benefits of psychedelics for these conditions deserve further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders (ADs) represent the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide, resulting in a significant global economic burden. Over 50% of individuals with ADs do not respond to standard therapies, making the identification of more effective anxiolytic drugs an ongoing research priority. In this work, we review the preclinical literature concerning the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on anxiety-like behaviors in preclinical models, and the clinical literature on anxiolytic effects of LSD in healthy volunteers and patients with ADs. Preclinical and clinical findings show that even if LSD may exacerbate anxiety acutely (both in \"microdoses\" and \"full doses\"), it induces long-lasting anxiolytic effects. Only two randomized controlled trials combining LSD and psychotherapy have been performed in patients with ADs with and without life-threatening conditions, showing a good safety profile and persisting decreases in anxiety outcomes. The effect of LSD on anxiety may be mediated by serotonin receptors (5-HT1A/1B, 5-HT2A/2C, and 5-HT7) and/or transporter in brain networks and circuits (default mode network, cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit, and prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuit), involved in the modulation of anxiety. It remains unclear whether LSD can be an efficacious treatment alone or only when combined with psychotherapy, and if \"microdosing\" may elicit the same sustained anxiolytic effects as the \"full doses\". Further randomized controlled trials with larger sample size cohorts of patients with ADs are required to clearly define the effective regimens, safety profile, efficacy, and feasibility of LSD for the treatment of ADs.",

Even now, as the stigma surrounding psychedelics diminishes in the 21st century, the figure of the \"mad scientist\" continues to occupy a space in what Ido Hartogsohn calls the \"collective set and setting,\" the larger framework of cultural understandings that shape how individuals experience psychedelic drugs. Scientists and humanities scholars who study these drugs have responded to this issue by drawing boundaries between those who used psychedelics carefully and those who used them ignorantly. Yet these boundaries were not always so clear in the past. Drawing on historical examples of LSD's use as a correctional tool in Canada, I show how enthusiasm about the drug's potential led several experienced and knowledgeable psychedelic therapists to use it on vulnerable populations in diverse institutional settings, such as correctional facilities. These examples reveal how the institutional context of modern industrial societies shaped the application of psychedelic therapy in the past and suggest that today's therapists need to carefully consider how this broader context impacts their work."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Psychedelics are getting closer to being widely used in clinical treatment. Music is known as a key element of psychedelic-assisted therapy due to its psychological effects, specifically on the emotion, meaning-making, and sensory processing. However, there is still a lack of understanding in how psychedelics influence brain activity in experimental settings involving music listening. OBJECTIVES: The main goal of our research was to investigate the effect of music, as a part of \"setting,\" on the brain states dynamics after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intake. METHODS: We used an open dataset, where a group of 15 participants underwent two functional MRI scanning sessions under LSD and placebo influence. Every scanning session contained three runs: two resting-state runs separated by one run with music listening. We applied K-Means clustering to identify the repetitive patterns of brain activity, so-called brain states. For further analysis, we calculated states' dwell time, fractional occupancy and transition probability. RESULTS: The interaction effect of music and psychedelics led to change in the time-varying brain activity of the task-positive state. LSD, regardless of the music, affected the dynamics of the state of combined activity of DMN, SOM, and VIS networks. Crucially, we observed that the music itself could potentially have a long-term influence on the resting-state, in particular on states involving task-positive networks. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that music, as a crucial element of \"setting,\" can potentially have an influence on the subject's resting-state during psychedelic experience. Further studies should replicate these results on a larger sample size.",

      "abstract": "There is renewed interest in the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and practice. Although acute subjective effects of LSD are mostly positive, negative subjective effects, including anxiety, may occur. The induction of overall positive acute subjective effects is desired in psychedelic-assisted therapy because positive acute experiences are associated with greater therapeutic long-term benefits. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces marked positive subjective effects and is used recreationally with LSD, known as \"candyflipping.\" The present study investigated whether the co-administration of MDMA can be used to augment acute subjective effects of LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design with 24 healthy subjects (12 women, 12 men) to compare the co-administration of MDMA (100 mg) and LSD (100 µg) with MDMA and LSD administration alone and placebo. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and endocrine effects and pharmacokinetics. MDMA co-administration with LSD did not change the quality of acute subjective effects compared with LSD alone. However, acute subjective effects lasted longer after LSD + MDMA co-administration compared with LSD and MDMA alone, consistent with higher plasma concentrations of LSD (Cmax and area under the curve) and a longer plasma elimination half-life of LSD when MDMA was co-administered. The LSD + MDMA combination increased blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil size more than LSD alone. Both MDMA alone and the LSD + MDMA combination increased oxytocin levels more than LSD alone. Overall, the co-administration of MDMA (100 mg) did not improve acute effects or the safety profile of LSD (100 µg). The combined use of MDMA and LSD is unlikely to provide relevant benefits over LSD alone in psychedelic-assisted therapy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04516902.",

      "abstract": "In 1962, Ontario's Addiction Research Foundation launched the first double-blind randomized controlled trial of LSD therapy as a treatment for alcoholism. The study, which found that LSD was not effective, was heavily criticized by other therapists working with the drug. These critics argued that the Toronto researchers who carried out the study were biased against LSD and used an anti-therapeutic method that was destined to produce negative results. Instead of creating a comfortable and supportive environment, they stressed, the Toronto group restrained patients to a bed in a hospital ward, used an unusually large dose of LSD, and hardly provided any careful therapeutic support. Some even compared this method to a \"form of torture.\" Historians have paid little attention to the study, mentioning it only as an example of flawed or naïve LSD therapy that contrasted with the more advanced \"psychedelic\" approach developed in Saskatchewan. In this paper, I take a closer look at the Toronto psychiatrists who carried out the study and created the unique method that was employed. I show that they were actually quite excited about LSD and were more sophisticated in their approach to its use than has been appreciated by historians and critics. In many ways, they had their own brand of LSD expertise that differed from that of the Saskatchewan group. Some of the problems with the ARF study, then, did not stem from negative bias or a lack of competency, but instead resulted from the awkward relationship between LSD therapy and controlled trials.",

There is stigma associated with these currently illegal substances, and use varies by race and age. We hypothesized that minoritized racial and ethnic populations, relative to White respondents, would perceive psychedelic use as riskier. METHODS: Using 2019 cross-sectional data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, we conducted a secondary analysis of 41,679 respondents. Perceived risk of heroin was used as a surrogate for overall risk of illegal substance use; heroin and lysergic acid diethylamide were the only substances queried this way in the sample. RESULTS: A majority regarded lysergic acid diethylamide (66.7%) and heroin (87.3%) as a great risk if used once or twice. There were clear differences by race, with White respondents and those indicating more than one race having significantly lower perceived risk of lysergic acid diethylamide than respondents from other groups. Perceived risk of use also significantly increased with age. CONCLUSION: Perceived risk of lysergic acid diethylamide is unevenly distributed across the population. Stigma and racial disparities in drug-related crimes likely contribute to this. As research into potential therapeutic indications for psychedelics continues, perceived risk of use may change.",

Therefore, it has been widely recognized as a promising therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Towards this end, we employed various Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) approaches including pharmacophore modelling and machine learning. Pharmacophores generated by structure-based (SB) (either crystallographic-based or docking-based) and ligand-based (LB) (either supervised or unsupervised) modelling methods were allowed to compete within the context of genetic algorithm/machine learning and were assessed by Shapley additive explanation values (SHAP) to end up with three successful pharmacophores that were used to screen the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database. Seventy-five NCI hits were tested for their LSD-1 inhibitory properties against neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, pancreatic carcinoma Panc-1 cells, glioblastoma U-87 MG cells and in vitro enzymatic assay, culminating in 3 nanomolar LSD-1 inhibitors of novel chemotypes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The non-selective serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) holds promise as a treatment for some psychiatric disorders. Psychedelic drugs such as LSD have been suggested to have therapeutic actions through their effects on learning. The behavioural effects of LSD in humans, however, remain incompletely understood. Here we examined how LSD affects probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) in healthy humans. METHODS: Healthy volunteers received intravenous LSD (75 μg in 10 mL saline) or placebo (10 mL saline) in a within-subjects design and completed a PRL task. Participants had to learn through trial and error which of three stimuli was rewarded most of the time, and these contingencies switched in a reversal phase. Computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) were fitted to the behavioural data to assess how LSD affected the updating ('learning rates') and deployment of value representations ('reinforcement sensitivity') during choice, as well as 'stimulus stickiness' (choice repetition irrespective of reinforcement history). RESULTS: Raw data measures assessing sensitivity to immediate feedback ('win-stay' and 'lose-shift' probabilities) were unaffected, whereas LSD increased the impact of the strength of initial learning on perseveration. Computational modelling revealed that the most pronounced effect of LSD was the enhancement of the reward learning rate. The punishment learning rate was also elevated. Stimulus stickiness was decreased by LSD, reflecting heightened exploration. Reinforcement sensitivity differed by phase. CONCLUSIONS: Increased RL rates suggest LSD induced a state of heightened plasticity. These results indicate a potential mechanism through which revision of maladaptive associations could occur in the clinical application of LSD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is currently being investigated in psychedelic-assisted therapy. LSD has a long duration of acute action of 8-11 hours. It produces its acute psychedelic effects via stimulation of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (HT2A) receptor. Administration of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin before LSD almost fully blocks the acute subjective response to LSD. However, unclear is whether ketanserin can also reverse the effects of LSD when administered after LSD. METHODS: We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 24 healthy participants who underwent two 14-hour sessions and received ketanserin (40 mg p.o.) or placebo 1 hour after LSD (100 µg p.o.). Outcome measures included subjective effects, autonomic effects, acute adverse effects, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and pharmacokinetics up to 12 hours. RESULTS: Ketanserin reversed the acute response to LSD, thereby significantly reducing the duration of subjective effects from 8.5 hours with placebo to 3.5 hours. Ketanserin also reversed LSD-induced alterations of mind, including visual and acoustic alterations and ego dissolution. Ketanserin reduced adverse cardiovascular effects and mydriasis that were associated with LSD but had no effects on elevations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Ketanserin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of LSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with an interaction between ketanserin and LSD and the view that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when occupying 5-HT2A receptors. Ketanserin can effectively be used as a planned or rescue option to shorten and attenuate the LSD experience in humans in research and LSD-assisted therapy.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Psychedelics elicit prosocial, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects via neuroplasticity, neurotransmission and neuro-immunomodulatory mechanisms. Whether psychedelics affect the brain endocannabinoid system and its extended version, the endocannabinoidome (eCBome) or the gut microbiome, remains unknown. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Adult C57BL/6N male mice were administered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or saline for 7 days. Sociability was assessed in the direct social interaction and three chambers tests. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampal endocannabinoids, endocannabinoid-like mediators and metabolites were quantified via high-pressure liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Neurotransmitter levels were assessed via HPLC-UV/fluorescence. Gut microbiome changes were investigated by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. KEY RESULTS: LSD increased social preference and novelty and decreased hippocampal levels of the N-acylethanolamines N-linoleoylethanolamine (LEA), anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine) and N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (DHEA); the monoacylglycerol 1/2-docosahexaenoylglycerol (1/2-DHG); the prostaglandins D2 (PGD2 ) and F2α (PGF2α ); thromboxane 2 and kynurenine. Prefrontal eCBome mediator and metabolite levels were less affected by the treatment. LSD decreased Shannon alpha diversity of the gut microbiota, prevented the decrease in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio observed in saline-treated mice and altered the relative abundance of the bacterial taxa Bifidobacterium, Ileibacterium, Dubosiella and Rikenellaceae RC9. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The prosocial effects elicited by repeated LSD administration are accompanied by alterations of hippocampal eCBome and kynurenine levels, and the composition of the gut microbiota. Modulation of the hippocampal eCBome and kynurenine pathway might represent a mechanism by which psychedelic compounds elicit prosocial effects and affect the gut microbiome.",

      "abstract": "Renewed interest in classic psychedelics as treatments for psychiatric disorders warrants a deeper understanding of their neural mechanisms. Single, high doses of psychedelic drugs have shown promise in treating depressive disorders, perhaps by reversing deficits in reward processing in the brain. In addition, there are anecdotal reports that repeated ingestion of low doses of LSD, or \"microdosing\", improve mood, cognition, and feelings of wellbeing. However, the effects of low doses of classic psychedelics on reward processing have not been studied. The current study examined the effects of two single, low doses of LSD compared to placebo on measures of reward processing. Eighteen healthy adults completed three sessions in which they received placebo (LSD-0), 13 μg LSD (LSD-13) and 26 μg LSD (LSD-26) in a within-subject, double-blind design. Neural activity was recorded while participants completed the electrophysiological monetary incentive delay task. Event-related potentials were measured during feedback processing (Reward-Positivity: RewP, Feedback-P3: FB-P3, and Late-Positive Potential: LPP). Compared to placebo, LSD-13 increased RewP and LPP amplitudes for reward (vs. neutral) feedback, and LSD-13 and LSD-26 increased FB-P3 amplitudes for positive (vs. negative) feedback. These effects were unassociated with most subjective measures of drug effects. Thus, single, low doses of LSD (vs. placebo) increased three reward-related ERP components reflecting increased hedonic (RewP), motivational (FB-P3), and affective processing of feedback (LPP). These results constitute the first evidence that low doses of LSD increase reward-related brain activity in humans. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of depressive disorders.",

Here, we investigated the effects of repeated lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on whole-genome DNA methylation and protein expression in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). METHODS: Whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) and proteomics profiling of the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) were performed to assess DNA methylation and protein expression changes following 7 days of repeated LSD administration (30 μg/kg/day); a treatment we previously found to potentiate excitatory neurotransmission and to increase dendritic spine density in the PFC in mice. qRT-PCR was employed to validate candidate genes detected in both analyses. RESULTS: LSD significantly modulated DNA methylation in 635 CpG sites of the mouse PFC, and in an independent cohort the expression level of 178 proteins. Gene signaling pathways affected are involved in nervous system development, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, quantity and cell viability of neurons and protein translation. Four genes and their protein product were detected as differentially methylated and expressed, and their transcription was increased. Specifically, Coronin 7 (Coro7), an axon guidance cue; Penta-EF-Hand Domain Containing 1 (Pef1), an mTORC1 and cell cycle modulator; Ribosomal Protein S24 (Rps24), required for pre-rRNA maturation and biogenesis of proteins involved with cell proliferation and migration, and Abhydrolase Domain Containing 6, Acylglycerol Lipase (Abhd6), a post-synaptic lipase. CONCLUSIONS: LSD affects DNA methylation, altering gene expression and protein expression related to neurotropic-, neurotrophic- and neuroplasticity signaling. This could represent a core mechanism mediating the effects of psychedelics.",

Studies in rodents suggest that these effects are produced by increased neural plasticity, including stimulation of the mTOR pathway, a key regulator of metabolism, plasticity, and aging.

Here we show that LSD treatment enhanced performance in a novel object recognition task in rats, and in a visuo-spatial memory task in humans. A proteomic analysis of human brain organoids showed that LSD affected metabolic pathways associated with neural plasticity, including mTOR. To gain insight into the relation of neural plasticity, aging and LSD-induced cognitive gains, we emulated the experiments in rats and humans with a neural network model of a cortico-hippocampal circuit. Using the baseline strength of plasticity as a proxy for age and assuming an increase in plasticity strength related to LSD dose, the simulations provided a good fit for the experimental data. Altogether, the results suggest that LSD has nootropic effects.",

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the 12-month incidence and nature of LSD-related adverse experiences resulting in emergency medical treatment (EMT) seeking in an international sample of people reporting LSD use. METHODS: We use data from the 2017 Global Drug Survey - a large anonymous online survey on patterns of drug use conducted between November 2016 and January 2017. RESULTS: Out of 10,293 past-year LSD users, 102 (1.0%) reported seeking EMT, with a per-event risk estimate of 0.2%. Younger age, comorbid mental health conditions and higher frequency of use were associated with increased risk of EMT seeking. The most common symptoms were psychological, including anxiety, panic and confusion, with the most common explanatory factors cited by respondents being poor 'setting' and 'mindset'. Most responders reported feeling back to normal within 24 h, but 11 participants experienced persistent issues after 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that LSD is a relatively safe drug in recreational settings. Adverse reactions are typically short-lived, self-limiting and psychological in nature. Sub-optimal set and setting were commonly reported as suspected contributory factors. Within clinical settings, patient screening, preparatory sessions and supervision should reduce these acute risks considerably.",

Since 2014, the authors have obtained 50 licenses on a case-by-case basis and developed a psychedelic-assisted group therapy model utilizing MDMA and LSD. The majority of the patients taking part in the psychedelic group therapy suffered from chronic complex post-traumatic stress disorder (c-PTSD), dissociative, and other post-traumatic disorders. Treatment modalities, typical developments and problems encountered during and after the psychedelic experiences are described. Recurrent depression poses a frequent problem, and requires special attention. Symptoms of c-PTSD predominantly addressed by the psychedelic experiences are the regulation of emotions and impulses, negative self-perception, alterations in relationships to others, as well as meaning, recall, and processing of traumatic memories. C-PTSD needs a larger number of psychedelic experiences in contrast to PTSD resulting from single trauma. In this model MDMA was most often used in the first phase to enhance motivation to change, strengthen the therapeutic alliance, allowing it to become more resilient, stress-relieved and less ambivalent. When emotional self-regulation, negative self-perception and structural dissociation had also begun to improve and trauma exposure was better tolerated, LSD was introduced to intensify and deepen the therapeutic process. The majority of participants improved by clinical judgement, and no serious adverse events occurred. A short case vignette describes a typical process. The experiences with this model can serve to further develop the method of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) and to give directions for future research."

      "abstract": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin are serotonergic psychedelic compounds with potential in the treatment of mental health disorders. Past neuroimaging investigations have revealed that both compounds can elicit significant changes to whole-brain functional organization and dynamics. A recent proposal linked past findings into a unified model and hypothesized reduced whole-brain hierarchical organization as a key mechanism underlying the psychedelic state, but this has yet to be directly tested. We applied a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique previously used to map hierarchical connectivity gradients to assess cortical organization in the LSD and psilocybin state from two previously published pharmacological resting-state fMRI datasets (N = 15 and 9, respectively). Results supported our primary hypothesis: The principal gradient of cortical connectivity, describing a hierarchy from unimodal to transmodal cortex, was significantly flattened under both drugs relative to their respective placebo conditions. Between-condition contrasts revealed that this was driven by a reduction of functional differentiation at both hierarchical extremes - default and frontoparietal networks at the upper end, and somatomotor at the lower. Gradient-based connectivity mapping indicated that this was underpinned by a disruption of modular unimodal connectivity and increased unimodal-transmodal crosstalk. Results involving the second and third gradient, which, respectively represent axes of sensory and executive differentiation, also showed significant alterations across both drugs. These findings provide support for a recent mechanistic model of the psychedelic state relevant to therapeutic applications of psychedelics. More fundamentally, we provide the first evidence that macroscale connectivity gradients are sensitive to an acute pharmacological manipulation, supporting a role for psychedelics as scientific tools to perturb cortical functional organization.",

An open-label design and a double-blind placebo-controlled design were used. RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of participants completed the study. Thirty-two adults (mean age = 28.8 years) received 50 (n = 3), 75 (n = 7), 100 (n = 3) LSD, 50 µg followed by 75 µg LSD (n = 9) 1 week apart, or placebo followed by a 75 µg LSD (n = 10) 1 week apart. There were no serious adverse events. Twenty-eight percent of participants experienced at least one expected mild adverse event, with one expected moderate adverse event. The maximum blood plasma levels occurred between 1.2 and 2 h post-administration, with an apparent half-life between 2.8 and 4.3 h. LSD largely induced greater subjective effects versus placebo. CONCLUSION: In the current novel intervention paradigm, 50, 75, and 100 µg LSD are tolerable with favourable safety profiles in healthy adults, only mild adverse events during the day of drug administration, and mystical-type subjective experiences. Future studies are needed to evaluate safety, tolerability, subjective effects, and cost-effectiveness in clinical populations.",

      "abstract": "Psychedelics acutely impair cognitive functions, but these impairments decline with growing experiences with psychedelics and microdoses may even exert opposing effects. Given the recent evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity, this explorative study aimed at investigating the potential of psychedelics to sub-acutely change cognition. For this, we applied a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 24 healthy volunteers receiving 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or an inactive placebo. Sub-acute changes in cognition were measured 24 h after dosing, including memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, ROCF; 2D Object-Location Memory Task, OLMT; Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, RAVLT), verbal fluency (phonological; semantic; switch), design fluency (basic; filter; switch), cognitive flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST), sustained and switching attention (Trail Making Test, TMT), inhibitory control (Stroop Task) and perceptual reasoning (Block Design Test, BDT). The results show that when compared to placebo and corrected for Body Mass Index (BMI) and abstinence period from psychedelics, LSD sub-acutely improved visuospatial memory (ROCF immediate recall points and percentage, OLMT consolidation percentage) and phonological verbal fluency and impaired cognitive flexibility (WCST: fewer categories achieved; more perseveration, errors and conceptual level responses). In conclusion, the low dose of LSD moderately induced both \"afterglow\" and \"hangover\". The improvements in visuospatial memory and phonological fluency suggest that LSD-assisted therapy should be explored as a novel treatment perspective in conditions involving memory and language declines such as brain injury, stroke or dementia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Controversy surrounds psychedelics and their potential to boost creativity. To date, psychedelic studies lack a uniform conceptualization of creativity and methodologically rigorous designs. AIMS: This study aimed at addressing previous issues by examining the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on creativity using multimodal tasks and multidimensional approaches. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 24 healthy volunteers received 50 μg of LSD or inactive placebo. Near drug peak, a creativity task battery was applied, including pattern meaning task (PMT), alternate uses task (AUT), picture concept task (PCT), creative metaphors task (MET) and figural creativity task (FIG). Creativity was assessed by scoring creativity criteria (novelty, utility, surprise), calculating divergent thinking (fluency, originality, flexibility, elaboration) and convergent thinking, computing semantic distances (semantic spread, semantic steps) and searching for data-driven special features. RESULTS: LSD, compared to placebo, changed several creativity measurements pointing to three overall LSD-induced phenomena: (1) 'pattern break', reflected by increased novelty, surprise, originality and semantic distances; (2) decreased 'organization', reflected by decreased utility, convergent thinking and, marginally, elaboration; and (3) 'meaning', reflected by increased symbolic thinking and ambiguity in the data-driven results. CONCLUSION: LSD changed creativity across modalities and measurement approaches. Three phenomena of pattern break, disorganization and meaning seemed to fundamentally influence creative cognition and behaviour pointing to a shift of cognitive resources 'away from normal' and 'towards the new'. LSD-induced symbolic thinking might provide a tool to support treatment efficiency in psychedelic-assisted therapy.",

Very little is known about the general toxicity of these compounds, especially about their possible neurotoxic effects at the cell level. The aim of this study was to address these gaps by assessing the toxic effects of 24-hour exposure to LSD and PCP in the concentration range of 0.39-100 μmol/L in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. After cell viability was established, cells treated with concentrations that reduced their viability up to 30 % were further subjected to the alkaline comet assay and biochemical assays that enable estimation of oxidative stress-related effects. Treatment with LSD at 6.25 μmol/L and with PCP at 3.13 μmol/L resulted with 88.06±2.05 and 84.17±3.19 % of viable cells, respectively, and led to a significant increase in primary DNA damage compared to negative control. LSD also caused a significant increase in malondialdehyde level, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and glutathione (GSH) level, PCP significantly increased ROS but lowered GSH compared to control. Treatment with LSD significantly increased the activities of all antioxidant enzymes, while PCP treatment significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) but decreased catalase (CAT) activity compared to control. Our findings suggest that LSD has a greater DNA damaging potential and stronger oxidative activity than PCP in SH-SY5Y cells.",

Classic serotonergic psychedelics are known to profoundly impact perception, cognition and language, yet their influence on the stream of thought remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effects of LSD on the stream of thought. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 24 healthy participants received 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or inactive placebo. Mind-wandering was measured by the Amsterdam Resting State Questionnaire (ARSQ), free association by the Forward Flow Task (FFT) for three seed word types (animals, objects, abstract words). ARSQ and FFT were assessed at +0 h, +2 h, +4 h, +6 h, +8 h and +24 h after drug administration, respectively. RESULTS: LSD, compared to placebo, induced different facets of mind-wandering we conceptualized as \"chaos\" (Discontinuity of Mind, decreased Sleepiness, Planning, Thoughts under Control, Thoughts about Work and Thoughts about Past), \"meaning\" (Deep Thoughts, Not Sharing Thoughts) and \"sensation\" (Thoughts about Odours, Thoughts about Sounds). LSD increased the FFT for abstract words reflecting an \"abstract flow\" under free association. Overall, chaos was strongest pronounced (+2 h to +6 h), followed by meaning (+2 h to +4 h), sensation (+2 h) and abstract flow (+4 h). CONCLUSIONS: LSD affects the stream of thought within several levels (active, passive), facets (chaos, meaning, sensation, abstractness) and time points (from +2 h to +6 h). Increased chaos, meaning and abstract flow at +4 h indicate the utility of a late therapeutic window in psycholytic therapy.",

Broadband desynchronization of EEG activity and disconnection in humans have been repeatedly shown; however, translational data from animals are completely lacking. Therefore, the main aim of our study was to assess the effects of tryptamine and phenethylamine psychedelics (psilocin 4 mg/kg, LSD 0.2 mg/kg, mescaline 100 mg/kg, and DOB 5 mg/kg) on EEG in freely moving rats. A system consisting of 14 cortical EEG electrodes, co-registration of behavioral activity of animals with subsequent analysis only in segments corresponding to behavioral inactivity (resting-state-like EEG) was used in order to reach a high level of translational validity. Analyses of the mean power, topographic brain-mapping, and functional connectivity revealed that all of the psychedelics irrespective of the structural family induced overall and time-dependent global decrease/desynchronization of EEG activity and disconnection within 1-40 Hz. Major changes in activity were localized on the large areas of the frontal and sensorimotor cortex showing some subtle spatial patterns characterizing each substance. A rebound of occipital theta (4-8 Hz) activity was detected at later stages after treatment with mescaline and LSD. Connectivity analyses showed an overall decrease in global connectivity for both the components of cross-spectral and phase-lagged coherence. Since our results show almost identical effects to those known from human EEG/MEG studies, we conclude that our method has robust translational validity.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used in psychiatric and psychological research and investigated as a potential treatment for medical and psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and cluster headache. OBJECTIVES: Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples. We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single-dose administrations of LSD. LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies. Single doses were 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg of LSD base. We investigated subjective effects (self-rated any drug effect, good drug effect, bad drug effect, and anxiety), blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, duration of the acute LSD response, acute (12 h) and subacute (24 h) adverse effects, reports of flashbacks, and liver and kidney function before and after the studies. RESULTS: LSD dose-dependently increased subjective, physiologic, and adverse effects. The dose-response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects. Maximal ratings of > 50% good drug effects were reached in 37%, 91%, 96%, and 91% of the LSD administrations at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg. Maximal ratings of > 50% bad drug effects were reached in 0%, 9%, 27%, 31% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Mean ratings of Oceanic Boundlessness were 10%, 25%, 41%, and 44%, and mean ratings of Anxious Ego-Dissolution were 3.4%, 13%, 20%, and 22% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. The physiologic effects of LSD were moderate. None of the subjects had systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg at any time. Peak heart rate > 100 beats/min was observed in 0%, 6%, 20%, and 25% of the subjects at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Maximal heart rates of 129 and 121 beats/min were observed in one subject at the 50 and 200 µg doses, respectively. Peak body temperature > 38° was observed in 0%, 11%, 7%, and 34% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Mean acute adverse effect scores on the List of Complaints were 5.6, 9.2, 12, and 13 at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Kidney and liver function parameters were unaltered. Six subjects reported transient flashback phenomena. CONCLUSIONS: The single-dose administration of LSD is safe in regard to acute psychological and physical harm in healthy subjects in a controlled research setting.",

This study sought to explore this paradoxical relationship connecting key parameters of the psychotic experience, psychotherapy, and psychedelic experience. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 healthy volunteers received 50 μg d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or inactive placebo. Psychotic experience was assessed by aberrant salience (Aberrant Salience Inventory, ASI), therapeutic potential by suggestibility (Creative Imagination Scale, CIS) and mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, FFMQ; Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS; Experiences Questionnaire, EQ), and psychedelic experience by four questionnaires (Altered State of Consciousness Questionnaire, ASC; Mystical Experiences Questionnaire, MEQ; Challenging Experiences Questionnaire, CEQ; Ego-Dissolution Inventory, EDI). Relationships between LSD-induced effects were examined. RESULTS: LSD induced psychedelic experiences, including alteration of consciousness, mystical experiences, ego-dissolution, and mildly challenging experiences, increased aberrant salience and suggestibility, but not mindfulness. LSD-induced aberrant salience correlated highly with complex imagery, mystical experiences, and ego-dissolution. LSD-induced suggestibility correlated with no other effects. Individual mindfulness changes correlated with aspects of aberrant salience and psychedelic experience. CONCLUSIONS: The LSD state resembles a psychotic experience and offers a tool for healing. The link between psychosis model and therapeutic model seems to lie in mystical experiences. The results point to the importance of meaning attribution for the LSD psychosis model and indicate that psychedelic-assisted therapy might benefit from therapeutic suggestions fostering mystical experiences.",

Recently the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics has been linked to the so-called phenomenon of \"connectedness.\" The aim of the present study was to explore whether long-lasting personality changes were observed in any of the 151 Danish psychiatric patients who were treated with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) from 1960 to 1974.The exploration included a reanalysis of a subgroup as well from a 1964 Danish historical cohort. Medical records and other case materials of the above mentioned 151 patients are kept in the Danish State Archives. The present author was granted access to the LSD case materials in the Danish State Archives, and respected confidentiality per the Archives Law. According to the LSD Damages Law from 1986, they all received financial compensation for LSD-inflicted harm.Analysis did not reveal any personality changes such as \"connectedness;\" however, other lasting personality changes were observed in 2 to 4 patients and in quite a few patients unwanted effects persisted for weeks or months following acute treatment. In the present analysis of the 1964 cohort, the same percentage of patients improved with LSD treatment as in the historical analysis. In the latter, however, little attention was given to side effects, such as suicide attempts, suicides, and one homicide.Future psychedelic research with psychiatric patients should respect the potential toxicity of LSD and other psychedelics and meticulously monitor possible side effects.",

These articles not only chronicle nursing's growth as a profession within the context of the events of the day, but also reveal prevailing societal attitudes about women, health care, and human rights. Today's nursing school curricula rarely include nursing's history, but it's a history worth knowing. To this end, From the AJN Archives highlights articles selected to fit today's topics and times. During the 1960s, the therapeutic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were studied in psychiatric clinical settings. In this February 1964 article, nurse Kay Parley writes enthusiastically about this work at one such research hospital. She describes the benefits of LSD therapy for patients with alcoholism, as well as the richness of the experience for the nurse who guides the patient through treatment. \"No role is so welcomed on our psychiatric unit than that of 'sitting' with a patient during LSD therapy.\" Parley vividly describes the nurse's role in these treatments. Her own long hospitalization for \"manic-depressive psychosis\" and treatment with LSD undoubtedly framed her approach to this therapy. Today there is renewed interest in the therapeutic use of psychoactive substances such as LSD.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regular ingestion of sub-hallucinogenic doses of psychedelics, referred to as \"microdosing\", has gained increasing popularity and attention in the press and in online forums, with reported benefits across multiple cognitive and emotional domains. Rigorously controlled studies to date, however, have been limited in scope and have failed to produce results comparable to those reported in the grey literature. METHODS: Eighty healthy male participants will receive 14 doses of placebo or 10 μg lysergic acid diethylamide orally every 3rd day over a 6-week treatment protocol. A battery of personality, creativity, mood, cognition, and EEG plasticity measures, as well as resting-state fMRI imaging, will be administered at baseline and at the end of the protocol. Creativity, mood, and plasticity measures will additionally be assessed in the acute phase of the first dose. Daily functioning will be monitored with questionnaires and a wearable sleep and activity tracker. DISCUSSION: This study will rigorously examine the claims presented in the microdosing grey literature by pairing a comparable dosing protocol with objective measures. Potential therapeutic implications include future clinical trials to investigate microdosed psychedelics as a standalone treatment or as an augmentation of psychotherapy in the treatment of depression, addiction, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and palliative care.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in LSD. This study investigates current information on the trends and correlates of LSD use from years 2002-2018 and seeks to develop an initial typology of use and misuse. METHODS: Data is taken from the NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) collected between 2002 and 2018 and trends and correlates of LSD use were analyzed with a survey adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that LSD use has increased 200 % over the study period (.23 % 2002-2005 to .72 % 2015-2018, AOR = 1.10, 95 % CI = 1.08, 1.12). Our findings also indicate several correlates of LSD use including higher levels of education (college degrees: AOR = 1.62, 95 % CI = 1.23, 2.13), not being married (divorced or separated, AOR = 2.31, 95 % CI = 1.44, 3.73, and have never been married, AOR = 5.67, f 95 % CI = 4.09, 7.86), as well as higher levels of antisocial behavior (having been arrested AOR = 3.20, 95 % CI = 2.50, 4.09) and comorbid mental health and substance abuse disorders (serious psychological distress, AOR = 2.39, 95 % CI = 2.05, 2.80). Further, four distinct subclasses were also discovered within LSD users and two of these subtypes of LSD users contained comorbid mental health disturbances and heavy involvement in the criminal justice system. CONCLUSION: LSD use has been on the rise within the last decades, particularly among those who are well educated. Two subclasses of LSD use (those with severe comorbid mental health disorders and those with criminal justice involvement) may require further interventions.",

In Switzerland, limited medical use of these substances is possible in patients not responding to other treatments (compassionate use). METHODS: This study aimed to describe patient characteristics, treatment indications and acute alterations of mind in patients receiving LSD (100-200 µg) and/or MDMA (100-175 mg) within the Swiss compassionate use programme from 2014-2018. Acute effects were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, and compared with those in healthy volunteers administered with LSD or MDMA and patients treated alone with LSD in clinical trials. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (including 12 women and six men, aged 29-77 years) were treated in group settings. Indications mostly included posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression. Generally, a drug-assisted session was conducted every 3.5 months after 3-10 psychotherapy sessions. LSD induced pronounced alterations of consciousness on the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale, and mystical-type experiences with increases in all scales on the Mystical Experience Questionnaire. Effects were largely comparable between patients in the compassionate use programme and patients or healthy subjects treated alone in a research setting. CONCLUSION: LSD and MDMA are currently used medically in Switzerland mainly in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder and depression in group settings, producing similar acute responses as in research subjects. The data may serve as a basis for further controlled studies of substance-assisted psychotherapy.",

Yet, most research focuses on the actions of LSD on the central nervous system. The interaction with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) has been neglected so far. Therefore, the aim was to assess the effects of LSD and the serotonin 2A receptor antagonist ketanserin on the ANS as assessed by heart rate variability (HRV) measures and their correlation with subjective drug-induced effects in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Thus, ANS activity was derived from electrocardiogram recordings after intake of placebo, LSD or ketanserin, and LSD by calculating R-peak-based measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Repeated measure ANOVA and partial correlation for HRV measures and subjective experience questionnaires were performed. LSD predominantly increased sympathetic activity, while ketanserin counteracted this effect on the ANS via an increase of parasympathetic tone. Sympathetic activity was positively and parasympathetic activity negatively associated with psychedelic effects of LSD. Furthermore, Placebo HRV measures predicted subjective experiences after LSD intake. The association between trait ANS activity and LSD-induced subjective experiences may serve as a candidate biomarker set for the effectiveness of LSD in the treatment of psychopathological conditions.",

      "abstract": "Clinical studies have reported that the psychedelic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) enhances empathy and social behavior (SB) in humans, but its mechanism of action remains elusive. Using a multidisciplinary approach including in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, behavioral paradigms, and molecular biology, the effects of LSD on SB and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were studied in male mice. Acute LSD (30 μg/kg) injection failed to increase SB. However, repeated LSD (30 μg/kg, once a day, for 7 days) administration promotes SB, without eliciting antidepressant/anxiolytic-like effects. Optogenetic inhibition of mPFC excitatory neurons dramatically inhibits social interaction and nullifies the prosocial effect of LSD. LSD potentiates the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and 5-HT2A, but not N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and 5-HT1A, synaptic responses in the mPFC and increases the phosphorylation of the serine-threonine protein kinases Akt and mTOR. In conditional knockout mice lacking Raptor (one of the structural components of the mTORC1 complex) in excitatory glutamatergic neurons (Raptorf/f:Camk2alpha-Cre), the prosocial effects of LSD and the potentiation of 5-HT2A/AMPA synaptic responses were nullified, demonstrating that LSD requires the integrity of mTORC1 in excitatory neurons to promote SB. Conversely, in knockout mice lacking Raptor in GABAergic neurons of the mPFC (Raptorf/f:Gad2-Cre), LSD promotes SB. These results indicate that LSD selectively enhances SB by potentiating mPFC excitatory transmission through 5-HT2A/AMPA receptors and mTOR signaling. The activation of 5-HT2A/AMPA/mTORC1 in the mPFC by psychedelic drugs should be explored for the treatment of mental diseases with SB impairments such as autism spectrum disorder and social anxiety disorder.",

      "abstract": "A 39-year-old female patient suffering from severe, treatment-resistant depression and other symptoms associated with a complex personality disorder was admitted to our open psychiatric ward for an experimental treatment with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The substance was administered in repeated weekly and ascending doses. Curiously, there were no substantial acute subjective effects of the drug despite adequate dosing, which was also confirmed by plasma drug concentration monitoring. However, the patient showed rapid and significant improvement with most notable changes in depressed mood, emotional instability, loss of energy, and suicidal ideations. Additionally, the SCL-90 questionnaire indicated significant decreases in global severity and in various psychopathological subscales. Improvements persisted for ~7 days after each administration. Due to the severe course of the illness and the resistance to previous treatment it was decided to continue this experimental approach with weekly repeated doses of LSD. The patient will be observed closely with regard to somatic and mental side effects. Two features of this case are remarkable: Firstly, administration of LSD was associated with significant improvements in various symptoms of a condition usually difficult to treat. Secondly, symptom reductions occurred in the absence of acute drug effects. Therefore, the mechanism of action seemed to deviate from the concept that improvements after administration of drugs like LSD are due to experiences during the acute drug effects. This case might indicate that LSD can induce rapid but transient beneficial effects on several psychopathological symptoms. The time course of these improvements resembled antidepressant effects seen after administration of ketamine."

      "abstract": "For most psychiatric disorders, including alcohol use disorder (AUD), approved pharmacological treatments are limited in their effectiveness, and new drugs that can easily be translated into the clinic are needed. Currently, great hope lies in the potential of psychedelics to effectively treat AUD. The primary hypothesis is that a single session of psychedelic-guided psychotherapy can restore normal brain function in AUD individuals and thereby reduce the risk of relapse in the long run. Here we applied three different treatment schedules with psilocybin/LSD in order to investigate relapse-like drinking in the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model. In contrast to the primary hypothesis, psychedelics had no long-lasting effects on the ADE in male and female rats, neither when administered in a high dosage regime that is comparable to the one used in clinical studies, nor in a chronic microdosing scheme. Only sub-chronic treatment with psilocybin produced a short-lasting anti-relapse effect. However, it is not a translatable treatment option to give psychedelics sub-chronically for relapse prevention. In conclusion, our results in the ADE model do not support the hypothesis that microdosing or high doses of psychedelic reduce relapse behavior. This conclusion has to be confirmed by applying other animal models of AUD. It could also well be that animal models of AUD might be unable to fully capture the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs and that only future large-scale clinical trials will be able to demonstrate the efficacy of psychedelics as a new treatment option for AUD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In academic settings around the world, there is a resurgence of interest in using psychedelic substances for the treatment of addictions, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and other diagnoses. This case series describes the medical consequences of accidental overdoses in three individuals. METHOD: Case series of information were gathered from interviews, health records, case notes, and collateral reports. RESULTS: The first case report documents significant improvements in mood symptoms, including reductions in mania with psychotic features, following an accidental lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) overdose, changes that have been sustained for almost 20 years. The second case documents how an accidental overdose of LSD early in the first trimester of pregnancy did not negatively affect the course of the pregnancy or have any obvious teratogenic or other negative developmental effects on the child. The third report indicates that intranasal ingestion of 550 times the normal recreational dosage of LSD was not fatal and had positive effects on pain levels and subsequent morphine withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: There appear to be unpredictable, positive sequelae that ranged from improvements in mental illness symptoms to reduction in physical pain and morphine withdrawal symptoms. Also, an LSD overdose while in early pregnancy did not appear to cause harm to the fetus.",

      "abstract": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was studied from the 1950s to the 1970s to evaluate behavioral and personality changes, as well as remission of psychiatric symptoms in various disorders. LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included. Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567 patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in the future."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The practice of \"microdosing,\" or the use of repeated, very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to improve mood or cognition, has received considerable public attention, but empirical studies are lacking. Controlled studies are needed to investigate both the therapeutic potential and the neurobiological underpinnings of this pharmacologic treatment. METHODS: The present study was designed to examine the effects of a single low dose of LSD (13 μg) versus placebo on resting-state functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow in healthy young adults. Twenty men and women, 18 to 35 years old, participated in 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning sessions in which they received placebo or LSD under double-blind conditions. During each session, the participants completed drug effect and mood questionnaires, and physiological measures were recorded. During expected peak drug effect, they underwent resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent and arterial spin labeling scans. Cerebral blood flow as well as amygdala and thalamic connectivity were analyzed. RESULTS: LSD increased amygdala seed-based connectivity with the right angular gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and the cerebellum, and decreased amygdala connectivity with the left and right postcentral gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. This low dose of LSD had weak and variable effects on mood, but its effects on positive mood were positively correlated with the increase in amygdala-middle frontal gyrus connectivity strength. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings show that a very low dose of LSD, which produces negligible subjective changes, alters brain connectivity in limbic circuits. Additional studies, especially with repeated dosing, will reveal whether these neural changes are related to the drug's purported antidepressant effect.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Research has shown that psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), have profound anti-inflammatory properties mediated by 5-HT2A receptor signaling, supporting their evaluation as a therapeutic for neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of orally repeated administration of 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD in older healthy individuals. In the current paper, we present safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety, tolerability, and dose response. METHODS: This was a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups (5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg LSD, and placebo), and received their assigned dose on six occasions (i.e., every 4 days). RESULTS: Forty-eight older healthy volunteers (mean age = 62.9 years) received placebo (n = 12), 5 μg (n = 12), 10 μg (n = 12), or 20 μg (n = 12) LSD. LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min. LSD was well tolerated, and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo. Assessments of cognition, balance, and proprioception revealed no impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest safety and tolerability of orally administered 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD every fourth day over a 21-day period and support further clinical development of LSD for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

All three substances are used recreationally. LSD and MDMA are being investigated as medications to assist psychotherapy, and D-amphetamine is used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. All three substances induce distinct acute subjective effects. However, differences in acute responses to these prototypical psychoactive substances have not been characterized in a controlled study. We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, and endocrine effects of single doses of LSD (0.1 mg), MDMA (125 mg), D-amphetamine (40 mg), and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in 28 healthy subjects. All of the substances produced comparable increases in hemodynamic effects, body temperature, and pupil size, indicating equivalent autonomic responses at the doses used. LSD and MDMA increased heart rate more than D-amphetamine, and D-amphetamine increased blood pressure more than LSD and MDMA. LSD induced significantly higher ratings on the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale and Mystical Experience Questionnaire than MDMA and D-amphetamine. LSD also produced greater subjective drug effects, ego dissolution, introversion, emotional excitation, anxiety, and inactivity than MDMA and D-amphetamine. LSD also induced greater impairments in subjective ratings of concentration, sense of time, and speed of thinking compared with MDMA and D-amphetamine. MDMA produced greater ratings of good drug effects, liking, high, and ego dissolution compared with D-amphetamine. D-Amphetamine increased ratings of activity and concentration compared with LSD. MDMA but not LSD or D-amphetamine increased plasma concentrations of oxytocin. None of the substances altered plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These results indicate clearly distinct acute effects of LSD, MDMA, and D-amphetamine and may assist the dose-finding in substance-assisted psychotherapy research.",

      "abstract": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent hallucinogenic substance that was extensively investigated by psychiatrists during the 1950s and 1960s. Researchers were interested in the unique effects induced by this substance, some of which resemble symptoms seen in schizophrenia. Moreover, during that period LSD was studied and used for the treatment of several mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, addiction and personality disorders. Despite this long history of research, how LSD induces its specific effects on a neuronal level has been relatively unclear. In recent years there has been a revival of research in hallucinogenic drugs and their possible clinical applications. These contemporary studies in the UK and Switzerland include neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this review, we collect and interpret these recent neuroimaging findings. Overall, previous results across studies indicate that LSD administration is associated with extensive alterations in functional brain connectivity, measuring the correlated activities between different brain regions. The studies mostly reported increases in connectivity between regions and, more specifically, consistently found increased connectivity within the thalamocortical system. These latter observations are in agreement with models proposing that hallucinogenic drugs exert their effects by inhibiting cerebral filtering of external and internal data. However, studies also face several limitations, including potential biases of neuroimaging measurements.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, experimental research on lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in humans has gained new momentum. In humans, LSD is metabolized rapidly into several metabolites but knowledge of the involved metabolizing enzymes is limited. The aim of the current study was to identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms involved in the metabolism of LSD to 6-norlysergic acid diethylamide (nor-LSD) and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD (O-H-LSD) in vitro, in order to evaluate potential effects of enzyme polymorphisms or prescription drugs on LSD pharmacokinetics. Additionally, interactions of LSD and both metabolites with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors were assessed. LSD was incubated with human liver microsomes over 4 h and the production of nor-LSD and O-H-LSD was quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Metabolism was inhibited by the addition of specific CYP inhibitors. Additionally, recombinant CYPs were used to verify the inhibition results obtained with microsomes and induction of metabolism was investigated in human hepatocyte-derived cells. Radioligand binding and calcium mobilization assays were used to determine 5-HT receptor affinities and activities, respectively. Human liver microsomes displayed minor metabolite formation (<1% metabolized) over 4 h. CYP2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 significantly contributed to the formation of nor-LSD, and CYP1A2, 2C9, 2E1, and 3A4 were significantly involved in the formation of O-H-LSD. These findings could be verified using recombinant CYPs. Enzyme induction with rifampicin distinctly increased the formation of both metabolites, whereas treatment with omeprazole only slightly increased formation of nor-LSD. LSD and nor-LSD were pharmacologically active at the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. Nor-LSD mainly differed from the parent compound by having a lower affinity to the 5-HT2C receptor. O-H-LSD displayed substantially weaker affinity and activity at serotonergic receptors in comparison to LSD. To conclude, human liver microsomes converted only small amounts of LSD to nor-LSD and O-H-LSD but several CYPs significantly contributed. Genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions could therefore influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LSD. Nor-LSD likely has hallucinogenic activity similar to LSD, whereas O-H-LSD is inactive. Drug-drug interaction studies in humans are required to further assess the clinical relevance of these findings.",

      "abstract": "Psychedelics exert unique effects on human consciousness. The thalamic filter model suggests that core effects of psychedelics may result from gating deficits, based on a disintegration of information processing within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) feedback loops. To test this hypothesis, we characterized changes in directed (effective) connectivity between selected CTSC regions after acute administration of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and after pretreatment with Ketanserin (a selective serotonin 2A receptor antagonist) plus LSD in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 25 healthy participants. We used spectral dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for resting-state fMRI data. Fully connected DCM models were specified for each treatment condition to investigate the connectivity between the following areas: thalamus, ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporal cortex. Our results confirm major predictions proposed in the CSTC model and provide evidence that LSD alters effective connectivity within CSTC pathways that have been implicated in the gating of sensory and sensorimotor information to the cortex. In particular, LSD increased effective connectivity from the thalamus to the posterior cingulate cortex in a way that depended on serotonin 2A receptor activation, and decreased effective connectivity from the ventral striatum to the thalamus independently of serotonin 2A receptor activation. Together, these results advance our mechanistic understanding of the action of psychedelics in health and disease. This is important for the development of new pharmacological therapeutics and also increases our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the potential clinical efficacy of psychedelics.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: The lysergamide lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a prototypical classical hallucinogen with remarkably high potency. LSD remains a popular recreational drug but is also becoming an important research tool for medical and neuroscience studies. Recently, several lysergamides that are close structural analogs of LSD have been sold as recreational drugs, which suggests that further studies are needed to explore the pharmacological properties of these compounds. OBJECTIVE: In this present investigation, another LSD congener, N-ethyl-N-cyclopropyl lysergamide (ECPLA), which to date has not been marketed as a recreational substance, was evaluated for its pharmacological features relative to those previously reported for LSD. The experiments focused on interactions with the 5-HT2A receptor, which is responsible for mediating the psychedelic effects of LSD and other hallucinogens. METHODS: Competitive binding assays were performed to measure the affinity of ECPLA for 27 monoamine receptors. The ability of ECPLA to activate human 5-HT2 receptor subtypes was assessed using calcium mobilization assays. Head twitch response (HTR) studies were conducted in C57BL/6J mice to determine whether ECPLA activates 5-HT2A receptors in vivo. Two other N-alkyl substituted lysergamides, N-methyl-N-isopropyl lysergamide (MIPLA) and N-methyl-N-propyl lysergamide (LAMPA), were also tested in the HTR paradigm for comparative purposes. RESULTS: ECPLA has high affinity for most serotonin receptors, α2-adrenoceptors, and D2-like dopamine receptors. Additionally, ECPLA was found to be a potent, highly efficacious 5-HT2A agonist for Gq-mediated calcium flux. Treatment with ECPLA induced head twitches in mice with a median effective dose (ED50) of 317.2 nmol/kg (IP), which is ~ 40% of the potency observed previously for LSD. LAMPA (ED50 = 358.3 nmol/kg) was virtually equipotent with ECPLA in the HTR paradigm whereas MIPLA (ED50 = 421.7 nmol/kg) was slightly less potent than ECPLA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the pharmacological properties of ECPLA, MIPLA, and LAMPA are reminiscent of LSD and other lysergamide hallucinogens.",

However, there has been no published research on the effect of LSD on alcohol consumption in animals. This study evaluated the effect of LSD in mice using a two-bottle choice alcohol drinking paradigm. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ethanol to develop preference and divided into three groups of equal ethanol consumption, and then treated with single intraperitoneal injection of saline or 25 or 50 μg/kg LSD and offered water and 20% ethanol. The respective LSD-treated groups were compared to the control group utilizing a multilevel model for repeated measures. In mice treated with 50 μg/kg LSD ethanol consumption was reduced relative to controls (p = 0.0035), as was ethanol preference (p = 0.0024), with a group mean reduction of ethanol consumption of 17.9% sustained over an interval of 46 days following LSD administration. No significant effects on ethanol consumption or preference were observed in mice treated with 25 μg/kg LSD. Neither total fluid intake nor locomotor activity in the LSD-treated groups differed significantly from controls. These results suggest that classical hallucinogens in the animal model merit further study as a potential approach to the identification of targets for drug discovery and investigation of the neurobiology of addiction."

      "abstract": "LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) was discovered almost 75 years ago, and has been the object of episodic controversy since then. While initially explored as an adjunctive psychiatric treatment, its recreational use by the general public has persisted and on occasion has been associated with adverse outcomes, particularly when the drug is taken under suboptimal conditions. LSD's potential to cause psychological disturbance (bad trips) has been long understood, and has rarely been associated with accidental deaths and suicide. From a physiological perspective, however, LSD is known to be non-toxic and medically safe when taken at standard dosages (50-200μg). The scientific literature, along with recent media reports, have unfortunately implicated \"LSD toxicity\" in five cases of sudden death. On close examination, however, two of these fatalities were associated with ingestion of massive overdoses, two were evidently in individuals with psychological agitation after taking standard doses of LSD who were then placed in maximal physical restraint positions (hogtied) by police, following which they suffered fatal cardiovascular collapse, and one case of extreme hyperthermia leading to death that was likely caused by a drug substituted for LSD with strong effects on central nervous system temperature regulation (e.g. 25i-NBOMe). Given the renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of LSD and other psychedelic drugs, it is important that an accurate understanding be established of the true causes of such fatalities that had been erroneously attributed to LSD toxicity, including massive overdoses, excessive physical restraints, and psychoactive drugs other than LSD.",

METHOD: This cross-sectional study employed targeted sampling and ethnographic mapping approaches via face-to-face interviews conducted at bars and electronic music festivals using an adapted, semi-structured version of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs questionnaire. The sample comprised 240 male and female young adults who had used ecstasy and/or LSD in the 90 days prior to the interview and who were not on treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. RESULTS: Of the 240 subjects enrolled (mean age: 22.9±4.5 years), 28.7% were gay or bisexuals. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the prevalence of depression symptoms in the past 12 months in the sexual minority group was 37% higher than among heterosexuals (prevalence ratio [PR]=1.79; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.03-3.11; p=0.037). CONCLUSION: Strategies should be developed to assess and address individual needs and treatment approaches should be tailored to address depressive symptoms in young, sexual minority club drug users.",

      "abstract": "Human research with hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has been ongoing in the USA since 1949. During the 1960s, LSD was investigated for a variety of psychiatric indications, including the following: as an aid in treatment of schizophrenia; as a means of creating a \"model psychosis\"; as a direct antidepressant; and as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Studies with all drugs, including LSD, have always been conducted under federal regulatory controls, including the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA; which ensured the safety of drugs) and the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the FDCA (which described appropriate scientific methodology and ensured drug efficacy). This paper details how the 1962 Amendments introduced numerous safety and efficacy requirements that must be in satisfied during clinical drug research-and how human studies conducted with LSD in the 1960s struggled with their fulfillment. Information is provided from Senate hearings, case law, and interviews with key investigators. Examples are also drawn from scientific papers and symposia published during and since that period, with a focus on information from clinical studies conducted with LSD by psychiatrist Albert Kurland at the Spring Grove State Hospital, near Baltimore, MD. While Kurland largely conformed with these new regulations, other investigators often fell short of complying with scientific standards and federal requirements. Thus, the human hallucinogen studies of the 1960s are best understood as providing pilot data on safety and efficacy, as well as testable hypotheses for current hallucinogen studies conducted under modern scientific and regulatory standards.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: New research has suggested the clinical use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin in selected patient populations. However, concerns about the clinical use of LSD were advanced in a large Danish follow-up study that assessed 151 LSD-treated psychiatric patients approximately 25 years after their treatment in the 1960s. AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to give a retrospective account of the short-term outcome of LSD treatment in these 151 Danish psychiatric patients. METHODS: The LSD case material in the Danish State Archives consists of medical case records of 151 LSD-treated patients, who complained and received economic compensation with the LSD Damages Law. The author carefully read and reviewed the LSD case material. RESULTS: LSD was used to treat a wide spectrum of mental disorders. Independent of diagnoses, 52 patients improved, and 48 patients worsened acutely with the LSD treatment. In a subgroup of 82 neurotic patients, the LSD dose-index (number of treatments multiplied by the maximal LSD dose) indicated the risk of acute worsening. In another subgroup of 19 patients with obsessive-compulsive neurosis, five patients later underwent psychosurgery. A small subgroup of 12 patients was treated with psilocybin. The long-term outcome was poor in most of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the significant limitations to a retrospective design, this database warrants caution in mental health patients. The use of LSD and psilocybin in mental health patients may be associated with serious short- and long-term side effects. Until further trials with rigorous designs have cleared these drugs of their potential harms, their clinical utility in these groups of patients has not been fully clarified.",

However, abnormalities in the attribution of personal relevance to sensory experiences are also critical features of many psychiatric disorders [2, 3]. Despite their clinical relevance, the neurochemical and anatomical substrates enabling meaningful experiences are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the neuropharmacology of personal relevance processing in humans by combining fMRI and the administration of the mixed serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptor (R) agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), well known to alter the subjective meaning of percepts, with and without pretreatment with the 5-HT2AR antagonist ketanserin. General subjective LSD effects were fully blocked by ketanserin. In addition, ketanserin inhibited the LSD-induced attribution of personal relevance to previously meaningless stimuli and modulated the processing of meaningful stimuli in cortical midline structures. These findings point to the crucial role of the 5-HT2AR subtype and cortical midline regions in the generation and attribution of personal relevance. Our results thus increase our mechanistic understanding of personal relevance processing and reveal potential targets for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses characterized by alterations in personal relevance attribution.",

      "abstract": "To date, pharmacological treatments for mood and anxiety disorders and for drug dependence show limited efficacy, leaving a large number of patients suffering severe and persistent symptoms. Preliminary studies in animals and humans suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials published from 1990 until 2015, assessing these therapeutic properties. Electronic searches were performed using the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Only clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Of these, 151 studies were identified, of which six met the established criteria. Reviewed studies suggest beneficial effects for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases, and tobacco and alcohol dependence. All drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD may be useful pharmacological tools for the treatment of drug dependence, and anxiety and mood disorders, especially in treatment-resistant patients. These drugs may also be useful pharmacological tools to understand psychiatric disorders and to develop new therapeutic agents. However, all studies reviewed had small sample sizes, and half of them were open-label, proof-of-concept studies. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with more patients are needed to replicate these preliminary findings."

The serotonin transporter (SERT) is responsible for the reuptake of 5-HT from the synaptic cleft and regulates serotonin signaling in the brain. In humans, SERT genetic variance is linked to the pathogenesis of various psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Rodent self-grooming is a complex, evolutionarily conserved patterned behavior relevant to stress, ASD and OCD. Genetic ablation of mouse Sert causes various behavioral deficits, including increased anxiety and grooming behavior. The hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent serotonergic agonist known to modulate human and animal behavior. Here, we examined heterozygous Sert(+/-) mouse behavior following acute administration of LSD (0.32 mg/kg). Overall, Sert(+/-) mice displayed a longer duration of self-grooming behavior regardless of LSD treatment. In contrast, LSD increased serotonin-sensitive behaviors, such as head twitching, tremors and backwards gait behaviors in both Sert(+/+) and Sert(+/-) mice. There were no significant interactions between LSD treatment and Sert gene dosage in any of the behavioral domains measured. These results suggest that Sert(+/-) mice may respond to the behavioral effects of LSD in a similar manner to wild-type mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peristomal skin lesions are frequent complications of ostomy; however, there is no generally accepted nomenclature and classification system. OBJECTIVE: An interdisciplinary German expert panel (GESS) composed of ten members, developed an innovative semiquantitative classification system for peristomal skin lesions for further stratification of ostomy therapy. This score is based on criteria which can be assessed by stomal therapists and treating physicians. RESULTS: The new peristomal skin lesion score grades three categories: lesion (L), status of ostomy (S) and disease (D). The L category describes the integrity of the skin as normal (L0), lesion with sustained integrity of skin (L1), integrity destroyed (L2) and local infection (L3). The S category rates the complexity of ostomy therapy as normal (S0), increased (S1) and high but not sufficiently effective (S2). The additional letters for categorization O. R. P. H. E. US describe anatomical pathologies of the stoma itself: ostomy stenosis (O), retraction (R), prolapse (P), hernia (H), edema (E) and unfavorable site (US). A systemic disorder is either absent (D0), irrelevant (D1) or relevant (D2). The LSD score is the basis for a management algorithm. CONCLUSION: The LSD score is comprehensive, standardized and holistic. Its straightforward use by health professionals can improve the consistency of the description of skin lesions and enhance the quality of ostomy therapy.",

AIWS is basically characterized by four frequent visual illusions: macropsia, micropsia, pelopsia and teleopsia. AIWS only appeared during LSD consumption and continued after LSD suspension, namely, Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD). This phenomenon did not cause a major functional impairment but provoked sufficient worry and concern due to its persistent continuation. The patient refused medical treatment and continued psychiatric follow-up. At the one year follow-up he reported complete remission.

      "abstract": "Substances known as psychedelics, hallucinogens and entheogens have been employed in ethnomedical traditions for thousands of years, but after promising uses in the 1950's and 1960's they were largely prohibited in medical treatment and human research starting in the 1970's as part of the fallout from the war on drugs. Nonetheless, there are a number of studies which suggest that these substances have potential applications in the treatment of addictions. While these substances are generally classified as Schedule I, alleging no established medical uses and a high drug abuse potential, there is nonetheless evidence indicating they might be safe and effective tools for short term interventions in addictions treatment. Evidence suggests that the psychedelics have a much greater safety profile than the major addictive drugs, having extremely low levels of mortality, and producing little if any physical dependence. This paper reviews studies evaluating the use of LSD, peyote, ibogaine and ayahuasca in the treatment of dependencies and the possible mechanisms underlying the indications of effectiveness. Evidence suggests that these substances help assist recovery from drug dependency through a variety of therapeutic mechanisms, including a notable \"after-glow\" effect that in part reflects their action on the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Serotonin has been long recognized as central to the psychedelics' well-known phenomenological, physical, emotional and cognitive dynamics. These serotonin-based dynamics are directly relevant to treatment of addiction because of depressed serotonin levels found in addict populations, as well as the role of serotonin as a neuromodulators affecting many other neurotransmitter systems.",

Chemically related to serotonin, LSD was initially hypothesized to produce a psychosislike state. Later, LSD was reported to have benefits in the treatment of addictions. However, widespread indiscriminate use and reports of adverse affects resulted in the classification of LSD as an illicit drug with no accepted medical use. This article reviews LSD's storied history from its discovery, to its use as a research tool, followed by its widespread association with the counterculture movement of the 1960s, and finally to its rebirth as a medicine with potential benefits in the treatment of addictions. LSD's pharmacology, phenomenology, effects at neurotransmitter receptors, and effects on patterns of gene expression are reviewed.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A recently published study showed the safety and efficacy of LSD-assisted psychotherapy in patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening diseases. Participants of this study were included in a prospective follow-up. METHOD: 12 months after finishing LSD psychotherapy, 10 participants were tested for anxiety (STAI) and participated in a semi-structured interview. A Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) was carried out on the interviews to elaborate about LSD effects and lasting psychological changes. RESULTS: None of the participants reported lasting adverse reactions. The significant benefits as measured with the STAI were sustained over a 12-month period. In the QCA participants consistently reported insightful, cathartic and interpersonal experiences, accompanied by a reduction in anxiety (77.8%) and a rise in quality of life (66.7%). Evaluations of subjective experiences suggest facilitated access to emotions, confrontation of previously unknown anxieties, worries, resources and intense emotional peak experiences à la Maslow as major psychological working mechanisms. The experiences created led to a restructuring of the person's emotional trust, situational understanding, habits and world view. CONCLUSIONS: LSD administered in a medically supervised psychotherapeutic setting can be safe and generate lasting benefits in patients with a life-threatening disease. Explanatory models for the therapeutic effects of LSD warrant further study.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has a history of use as a psychotherapeutic aid in the treatment of mood disorders and addiction, and it was also explored as an enhancer of mind control. OBJECTIVES: The present study sought to test the effect of LSD on suggestibility in a modern research study. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were administered with intravenous (i.v.) LSD (40-80 μg) in a within-subject placebo-controlled design. Suggestibility and cued mental imagery were assessed using the Creative Imagination Scale (CIS) and a mental imagery test (MIT). CIS and MIT items were split into two versions (A and B), balanced for 'efficacy' (i.e. A ≈ B) and counterbalanced across conditions (i.e. 50 % completed version 'A' under LSD). The MIT and CIS were issued 110 and 140 min, respectively, post-infusion, corresponding with the peak drug effects. RESULTS: Volunteers gave significantly higher ratings for the CIS (p = 0.018), but not the MIT (p = 0.11), after LSD than placebo. The magnitude of suggestibility enhancement under LSD was positively correlated with trait conscientiousness measured at baseline (p = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that the influence of suggestion is enhanced by LSD. Enhanced suggestibility under LSD may have implications for its use as an adjunct to psychotherapy, where suggestibility plays a major role. That cued imagery was unaffected by LSD implies that suggestions must be of a sufficient duration and level of detail to be enhanced by the drug. The results also imply that individuals with high trait conscientiousness are especially sensitive to the suggestibility-enhancing effects of LSD.",

Treated patients contributed data before and during treatment. Untreated patients contributed natural history data. PARTICIPANTS: Consenting adults (N = 62) with a diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease who attended a specialist treatment centre in England. This cohort represented 83 % of all patients in the UK with a confirmed diagnosis of this rare condition. At study entry, all but three patients were receiving ERT (range of treatment duration, 0 to 3.1 years). OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC); ventilation dependency; mobility; 6 min walk test (6MWT); muscle strength and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: An association was found between time on ERT and significant increases in the distance walked in the 6MWT (p < 0.001) and muscle strength scores (p < 0.001). Improvements in both these measures were seen over the first 2 years of treatment with ERT. No statistically significant relationship was found between time on ERT and respiratory function or in BMI. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide some further evidence of the effectiveness of ERT in adults with late-onset Pompe disease.

Treated patients contributed data before and during treatment and untreated patients contributed natural history data. PARTICIPANTS: Consenting adults (N = 289) and children (N = 22) with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease attending a specialist Lysosomal Storage Disorder treatment centre in England. At recruitment 211 adults and seven children were on ERT (range of treatment duration, 0 to 9.7 and 0 to 4.2 years respectively). OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes chosen to reflect disease progression included left ventricular mass index (LVMI); proteinuria; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); pain; hearing and transient ischaemic attacks (TIA)/stroke. RESULTS: We found evidence of a statistically significant association between time on ERT and a small linear decrease in LVMI (p = 0.01); a reduction in the risk of proteinuria after adjusting for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (p < 0.001) and a small increase in eGFR in men and women without pre-treatment proteinuria (p = 0.01 and p < 0.001 respectively). The same analyses in children provided no statistically significant results. No associations between time on ERT and pain, risk of needing a hearing aid, or risk of stroke or TIAs, were found.

These build over the 90 day course of treatment and can persist at full strength for at least several months after cessation of treatment. The behaviors are consistent with those observed in animal models of schizophrenia and include hyperactivity, reduced sucrose-preference, and decreased social interaction. In order to elucidate molecular changes that underlie these aberrant behaviors, we chronically treated rats with LSD and performed RNA-sequencing on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area highly associated with both the actions of LSD and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses. We observed widespread changes in the neurogenetic state of treated animals four weeks after cessation of LSD treatment. QPCR was used to validate a subset of gene expression changes observed with RNA-Seq, and confirmed a significant correlation between the two methods. Functional clustering analysis indicates differentially expressed genes are enriched in pathways involving neurotransmission (Drd2, Gabrb1), synaptic plasticity (Nr2a, Krox20), energy metabolism (Atp5d, Ndufa1) and neuropeptide signaling (Npy, Bdnf), among others. Many processes identified as altered by chronic LSD are also implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and genes affected by LSD are enriched with putative schizophrenia genes. Our results provide a relatively comprehensive analysis of mPFC transcriptional regulation in response to chronic LSD, and indicate that the long-term effects of LSD may bear relevance to psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia.",

These are commonly referred to as \"flashbacks\" or Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD). Here we present two cases of patients with a prior history of LSD use who turned to psychiatric consultation following brief episodes of HPPD. Surprisingly, in both cases new visual imagery appeared during episodes of flashbacks which was not experienced during primary LSD use. Both subjects reported the ability to discern between LSD-associated visual disturbances and new visual imagery. This phenomenon did not cause functional impairment and in both cases caused gradual concern due to its persistence. Both patients refused medical treatment and continued psychiatric follow-up. At one year follow-up both patients reported almost complete spontaneous remission. To the best of our knowledge these are the first reported cases of LSD-related benign flashbacks in which new imagery is experienced. Reasons for this reversible and apparently harmless side effect are proposed. Conclusions from case reports should be taken with caution.",

All hallucinogenic drugs have in common a high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor. Metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptor ligands show efficacy in modulating the cellular and behavioral responses induced by hallucinogenic drugs. Here, we explored the effect of chronic treatment with the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist 2S-2-amino-2-(1S,2S-2-carboxycyclopropan-1-yl)-3-(xanth-9-yl)-propionic acid (LY341495) on the hallucinogenic-like effects induced by LSD (0.24mg/kg). Mice were chronically (21 days) treated with LY341495 (1.5mg/kg), or vehicle, and experiments were carried out one day after the last injection. Chronic treatment with LY341495 down-regulated [(3)H]ketanserin binding in somatosensory cortex of wild-type, but not mGlu2 knockout (KO), mice. Head-twitch behavior, and expression of c-fos, egr-1 and egr-2, which are responses induced by hallucinogenic 5-HT(2A) agonists, were found to be significantly decreased by chronic treatment with LY341495. These findings suggest that repeated blockade of the mGlu2 receptor by LY341495 results in reduced 5-HT(2A) receptor-dependent hallucinogenic effects of LSD.",

      "abstract": "The decline in therapeutic research with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the United States over the course of the 1960s has commonly been attributed to the growing controversy surrounding its recreational use. However, research difficulties played an equal role in LSD psychotherapy's demise, as they frustrated researchers' efforts to clearly establish the efficacy of treatment. Once the Kefauver Harris Drug Amendments of 1962 introduced the requirement that proof of efficacy be established through controlled clinical trials before a drug could be approved to market, the value of clinical research became increasingly dependent on the scientific rigor of the trial's design. LSD psychotherapy's complex method of utilizing drug effects to catalyze a psychological treatment clashed with the controlled trial methodology on both theoretical and practical levels, making proof of efficacy difficult to obtain. Through a close examination of clinical trials performed after 1962, this article explores how the new emphasis on controlled clinical trials frustrated the progress of LSD psychotherapy research by focusing researchers' attention on trial design to the detriment of their therapeutic method. This analysis provides a new perspective on the death of LSD psychotherapy and explores the implications of the Drug Amendments of 1962.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: In schizophrenia patients, optimal treatment with antipsychotics requires weeks to months of sustained drug therapy. However, single administration of antipsychotic drugs can reverse schizophrenia-like behavioral alterations in rodent models of psychosis. This raises questions about the physiological relevance of such antipsychotic-like activity. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the effects of chronic treatment with clozapine on the cellular and behavioral responses induced by the hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) as a mouse model of psychosis. METHOD: Mice were treated chronically (21 days) with 25 mg/kg/day clozapine. Experiments were conducted 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after the last clozapine administration. [(3)H]Ketanserin binding and 5-HT ( 2A ) mRNA expression were determined in mouse somatosensory cortex. Head-twitch behavior, expression of c-fos, which is induced by all 5-HT(2A) agonists, and expression of egr-1 and egr-2, which are LSD-like specific, were assayed. RESULTS: Head-twitch response was decreased and [(3)H]ketanserin binding was downregulated in 1, 7, and 14 days after chronic clozapine. 5-HT ( 2A ) mRNA was reduced 1 day after chronic clozapine. Induction of c-fos, but not egr-1 and egr-2, was rescued 7 days after chronic clozapine. These effects were not observed after short treatment (2 days) with clozapine or chronic haloperidol (1 mg/kg/day). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a murine model of chronic atypical antipsychotic drug action and suggest downregulation of the 5-HT(2A) receptor as a potential mechanism involved in these persistent therapeutic-like effects.",

Two reviewers independently extracted the data, pooling the effects using odds ratios (ORs) by a generic inverse variance, random effects model. We identified six eligible trials, including 536 participants. There was evidence for a beneficial effect of LSD on alcohol misuse (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.36-2.84; p = 0.0003). Between-trial heterogeneity for the treatment effects was negligible (I² = 0%). Secondary outcomes, risk of bias and limitations are discussed.

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: After decades of social stigma, hallucinogens have reappeared in the clinical literature demonstrating unique benefits in medicine. The precise behavioral pharmacology of these compounds remains unclear, however. OBJECTIVES: Two commonly studied hallucinogens, (±)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), were investigated both in vivo and in vitro to determine the pharmacology of their behavioral effects in an animal model. METHOD: Rabbits were administered DOI or LSD and observed for head bob behavior after chronic drug treatment or after pretreatment with antagonist ligands. The receptor binding characteristics of DOI and LSD were studied in vitro in frontocortical homogenates from naïve rabbits or ex vivo in animals receiving an acute drug injection. RESULTS: Both DOI- and LSD-elicited head bobs required serotonin(2A) (5-HT(2A)) and dopamine(1) (D(1)) receptor activation. Serotonin(2B/2C) receptors were not implicated in these behaviors. In vitro studies demonstrated that LSD and the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist, ritanserin, bound frontocortical 5-HT(2A) receptors in a pseudo-irreversible manner. In contrast, DOI and the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist, ketanserin, bound reversibly. These binding properties were reflected in ex vivo binding studies. The two hallucinogens also differed in that LSD showed modest D(1) receptor binding affinity whereas DOI had negligible binding affinity at this receptor. CONCLUSION: Although DOI and LSD differed in their receptor binding properties, activation of 5-HT(2A) and D(1) receptors was a common mechanism for eliciting head bob behavior. These findings implicate these two receptors in the mechanism of action of hallucinogens.",

      "abstract": "Many people who take LSD experience a second temporal phase of LSD intoxication that is qualitatively different, and was described by Daniel Freedman as \"clearly a paranoid state.\" We have previously shown that the discriminative stimulus effects of LSD in rats also occur in two temporal phases, with initial effects mediated by activation of 5-HT(2A) receptors (LSD30), and the later temporal phase mediated by dopamine D2-like receptors (LSD90). Surprisingly, we have now found that non-competitive NMDA antagonists produced full substitution in LSD90 rats, but only in older animals, whereas in LSD30, or in younger animals, these drugs did not mimic LSD. Chronic administration of low doses of LSD (>3 months, 0.16 mg/kg every other day) induces a behavioral state characterized by hyperactivity and hyperirritability, increased locomotor activity, anhedonia, and impairment in social interaction that persists at the same magnitude for at least three months after cessation of LSD treatment. These behaviors, which closely resemble those associated with psychosis in humans, are not induced by withdrawal from LSD; rather, they are the result of neuroadaptive changes occurring in the brain during the chronic administration of LSD. These persistent behaviors are transiently reversed by haloperidol and olanzapine, but are insensitive to MDL-100907. Gene expression analysis data show that chronic LSD treatment produced significant changes in multiple neurotransmitter system-related genes, including those for serotonin and dopamine. Thus, we propose that chronic treatment of rats with low doses of LSD can serve as a new animal model of psychosis that may mimic the development and progression of schizophrenia, as well as model the established disease better than current acute drug administration models utilizing amphetamine or NMDA antagonists such as PCP.",

The justification for using LSD was often based on the default logic that other treatment efforts had failed. Several positive outcomes were reported with the use of LSD, but most of these studies lacked proper experimental controls and presented largely narrative/descriptive data. Today there is renewed interest in the use of psychedelic drugs for therapeutic purposes. While this resurgence of research has not yet included children with autism, this review of the LSD studies from the 1960s and 1970s offers important lessons for future efforts to evaluate new or controversial treatments for children with autism.",

One group of rats received a staggered double hemisection (DH) at postnatal day 2 (P2) of the left hemicord at T11 and the right hemicord at T12. Another group received complete transection (CT) at T11 on P2. A third group was sham operated. Each of these groups was also treated with the drug combination. Drugs were administered intrathecally above the lesion during surgery, and again s.c. at P4, P6, P8, and P10. Intracellular recording in an in vitro spinal cord preparation at P10-P12 in DH rats revealed weak polysynaptic connections to lumbar motoneurons through the injury region, but only in those receiving NT-3 + LSD; NT-3 or LSD alone had no effect. In behavioral experiments, the frequency of rearing in an open field and hindlimb kicks during swimming was assessed every 3-4 days from P9 to P58. Both CT and DH injury severely impaired rearing and hindlimb kicking during swimming. DH rats treated with NT-3 + LSD showed significantly more kicks during swimming than untreated DH or CT rats and treated CT rats beginning as early as P9 and lasting through the duration of testing. Rearing behavior was also improved by treatment but beginning only in the 3rd postnatal week, the time at which it normally develops. Rearing frequency reached sham control levels by P40. Our results suggest this combination treatment may be a promising new strategy for facilitating recovery from moderate spinal cord injury.",

      "abstract": "The psychoactive properties of the hallucinogen LSD have frequently been attributed to high affinity interactions with serotonin 5HT2 receptors in brain. Possible effects of LSD on dopamine D2/3 receptor availability have not previously been investigated in living brain. Therefore, we used PET to map the binding potential (pB) of [11C]raclopride in brain of three pigs, first in a baseline condition, and again at 1 and 4 h after administration of LSD (2.5 microg/kg, i.v.). There was a progressive treatment effect in striatum, where the pB was significantly reduced by 19% at 4 h after LSD administration. Concomitant maps of cerebral blood flow did not reveal significant changes in perfusion during this interval. Subsequent in vitro studies showed that LSD displaced [3H]raclopride (2 nM) from pig brain cryostat sections with an IC50 of 275 nM according to a one-site model. Fitting of a two-site model to the data suggested the presence of a component of the displacement curves with a subnanomolar IC50, comprising 20% of the total [3H]raclopride binding. In microdialysis experiments, LSD at similar and higher doses did not evoke changes in the interstitial concentration of dopamine or its acidic metabolites in rat striatum. Together, these results are consistent with a direct interaction between LSD and a portion of dopamine D2/3 receptors in pig brain, possibly contributing to the psychopharmacology of LSD.",

They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone. This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as \"flashbacks\" related to prior LSD consumption. Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off. During a six-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of visual disturbances. This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign, short-term and self-limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment. Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution.",

Two out-patients with LSD-induced HPPD were successfully treated with clonazepam. They had not responded to low potency benzodiazepines or low doses of classic antipsychotics. After clonazepam discontinuation they reported a marked improvement and only mild symptomatology which persisted during a six month follow-up period. High potency benzodiazepines like clonazepam, which has serotonergic properties, may be superior to low-potency benzodiazepines in the treatment of some patients with LSD-induced HPPD.",
