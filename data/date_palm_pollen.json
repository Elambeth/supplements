      "abstract": "Infertility represents a significant global health challenge affecting both men and women. Despite regular unprotected sexual intercourse, approximately 15% of couples of reproductive age struggle to conceive within 12 months, with 10% of infertility cases attributed to unknown causes worldwide. As a result, numerous studies have turned their attention to exploring the use of natural products for the prevention and treatment of infertility. Among these natural remedies is date palm pollen (DPP), a male reproductive powder derived from the blossoms of the Phoenix dactylifera L. palm tree, which has a long history of use as a dietary supplement, particularly as an aphrodisiac and fertility enhancer for both men and women. This review critically examines the diverse components of DPP, including metabolites, proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, to elucidate its potential impact on human reproduction. The analysis thoroughly assesses the composition of DPP in relation to its effects on enhancing reproductive processes and delves into its traditional uses and therapeutic benefits in male fertility, such as the enhancement of sexual desire, semen quality, and hormonal equilibrium. Similarly, it explores the influence of DPP on female fertility, emphasizing its potential to improve factors such as lubrication, desire, ovulation, and hormonal balance. Overall, this review underscores the potential of DPP as a natural remedy for addressing reproductive disorders."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidences suggest that date palm pollen (DPP) induces antioxidant activity and improves semen parameters in male rats. However, there is a few scientific evidences in support of the DPP effects on human male fertility. Hence, the effect of oral consumption of DPP on sperm parameters and expression pattern of Peroxiredoxin- 1 (PRDX1) and Peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6) genes was evaluated in men with infertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current controlled clinical trial included 40 men with infertility (DPP group) and 10 normospermic fertile men as controls. The DPP group received gelatinous capsules of DPP (400 mg/kg) for 74 days. Semen sampling was done before and after treatment in the both groups. Semen analysis and 8-isoprostane concentration assessments were performed by computer-assisted sperm analysis and ELISA methods, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays were employed to explore expression of PRDX1 and PRDX6 genes. RESULTS: DPP consumption significantly improved semen volume (P=0.030), count (P<0.001) and morphology of sperm (P=0.023). Concentration of 8-isoprostane was significantly decreased after intervention in the DPP group (P<0.001). DPP consumption led to a significant elevation in the expression of PRDX1 and PRDX6 genes (P<0.001). Elevated gene expression of PRDX6 and PRDX1 was positively correlated with improved parameters of sperm including count, volume, motility and morphology. CONCLUSION: Taken together, DPP seems to promote sperm quality through a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing expression of antioxidant genes. Further large-scale studies are required to challenge this hypothesis (registration number: IRCT2015021221014N2)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bypass graft surgery of the coronary artery has a significant effect on the creation and development of sexual dysfunction among male patients. The previous studies have demonstrated that date palm pollen (DPP) increases the count and quality of sperm. Additionally, it has been shown that DPP has a protective effect against myocardial infarction and cardiac remodeling. Therefore, this is the first study investigating the impact of DPP (Phoenix dactylifera L.) on managing male sexual dysfunction after coronary artery bypass graft. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients (DPP group n = 30, control group n = 30) of Iranian men after coronary artery bypass graft. Two parallel groups were randomly generated from the study participants. The intervention group was prescribed 3 grams of the powder of DPP twice a day (9 AM and 9 PM) for two months, while the control group received the same prescription of the placebo powder. RESULTS: The DPP consumption significantly increased the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) (from 23.21 to 46.57) and the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Desire (HISD) (from 59.39 to 64.45) scores over time in the intervention group. However, there were no significant changes in the control group. CONCLUSION: Daily intake of 6 g DPP for two months exhibited beneficial effects on the symptoms of male sexual dysfunction in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)."

      "abstract": "Recently, several attempts have been made to use the phytopharmaceuticals from plant extracts as reducing, capping and stabilizing agents for the biomimetic synthesis of various metal nanoparticles conjugated to the phytopharmaceuticals. These biogenic metal nanoparticles are non-toxic and can be used as contrast agents, drug delivery vehicles and photothermal agents for cancer therapy. Herein, we report the synthesis of both silver and gold nanoparticles using the pollen extract of Phoenix dactylifera (Date Palm), characterization using UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, quantitation of phytochemicals capping the nanoparticles using Folin - Ciocalteu's method, cytotoxicity studies on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, cancer cell death analysis using fluorescent microscopy, and modulation of expression of the pro-apoptotic p53 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. The biosynthesis resulted in stable and poly-dispersed silver nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles, exhibiting strong and broad surface plasmon absorption peaks. The elemental analysis confirmed the presence of gold and silver of high purity and also the organic moieties from the plant extract acting as capping and stabilizing agents. The biogenic nanoparticles also exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells and showed signs of apoptotic cell death. Immunoassays revealed the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein p53 and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 after the nanoparticle treatment.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to examine the putative preventive effect of the ethanolic extract Date Palm Pollen (DPP, Phoenix dactylifera L., family Arecaceae) on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Twenty four rats were randomly divided into four groups including control. They were treated with DPP extract (400mg/kg) and clopidogrel (0.2mg/kg) for 7days followed by myocardial injury induction using subcutaneous isoproterenol (100mg/kg) with an interval of 24h for two days (6th and 7th day). Administration of isoproterenol exhibited indicative changes in the ECG pattern evidenced by significant elevation of ST-segment and cardiac injury markers viz.; troponin-T, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by 315%, 71%, 64% and 170%, respectively as compared to control. Additionally, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in plasma was increased by 33% associated to histological myocardial necrosis. However, pre-co-treatment with DPP extract improved the cardiac biomarkers injury, normalized cardiac function indices and prevented the ventricular remodeling process through inhibition of ACE activity by 34% and the inhibition of the generation of radical oxygen species. Extensive characterization of this DPP extract using LC-HRMS revealed numerous flavonoids and phenols compounds which could be endowed with cardiopreventive actions. Overall, these results proved that DPP extract has preventive effects on cardiac remodeling process.",

      "abstract": "Hyper- or hypothyroidism can impair testicular function leading to infertility. The present study was designed to examine the protective effect of date palm pollen (DPP) extract on thyroid disorder-induced testicular dysfunction. Rats were divided into six groups. Group I was normal control. Group II received oral DPP extract (150 mg kg(-1)), group III (hyperthyroid group) received intraperitoneal injection of L-thyroxine (L-T4, 300 μg kg(-1); i.p.), group IV received L-T4 plus DPP extract, group V (hypothyroid group) received propylthiouracil (PTU, 10 mg kg(-1); i.p.) and group VI received PTU plus DPP extract. All treatments were given every day for 56 days. L-T4 or PTU lowered genital sex organs weight, sperm count and motility, serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone (T), testicular function markers and activities of testicular 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). Moreover, L-T4 or PTU increased estradiol (E2) serum level, testicular oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptotic markers. Morphometric and histopathologic studies backed these observations. Treatment with DPP extract prevented LT4- or PTU induced changes. In addition, supplementation of DPP extract to normal rats augmented sperm count and motility, serum levels of LH, T and E2 paralleled with increased activities of 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD as well as testicular antioxidant status. These results provide evidence that DPP extract may have potential protective effects on testicular dysfunction induced by altered thyroid hormones.",

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate effects of DPP and Astragalus ovinus (A.Ovinus) on fertility in healthy adult male rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six rats were divided into six groups (n=6) including control and five treatment groups. DPP (120, 240 and 360 mg/kg) and A.ovinus (100, 500 mg/ kg) were orally given to the treatment groups. After thirty-five days, blood samples were taken to determine serum levels of FSH, LH, testosterone and estradiol. Weight of testis and epididymis, sperm count, sperm motility, seminiferous tubules diameter (STD), germinal cell layer thickness (GCLT), sertoli, leydig and spermatogonia cells were also evaluated. RESULTS: DPP at the of 120 and 240 mg/kg doses significantly raised the ratio of testis or epididymis to body weight, sperm count, sperm motility , and estradiol level compared to the control group (p<0.05). LH and testosterone levels only noticeably increased at 120 mg/kg of DPP (p<0.01 and p<0.001 respectively). STD increased in the three applied doses (p=0.001). A. ovinus extract at the indicated doses produced a significant reduction in the ratio of testis or epididymis to body weight and sperm motility (p<0.05). Sperm count, spermatogonia, leydig cells and FSH level decreased at dose of 500 mg/kg. Furthermore, GCLT, spermatogonia cells, and serum estradiol level increased at 100 mg/kg dose of A. ovinus. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that DPP could improve fertility factors, while A.ovinus can exhibit deleterious effects on gonad and sperm parameters in rats."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the effectiveness of date palm pollen (DPP) in the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis induced by radiation and chemotherapy. METHODS: Twenty subjects with varying head and neck cancers were enrolled. Ten subjects were treated with DPP administered orally (2 g daily for 42 days) as a swish and swallow suspension, and 10 control subjects received the facility standard of care. Objective oral assessments using the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS) were conducted at baseline and while the subjects were on treatment. Study subjects also evaluated the treatment impact by visual analog scales for severity of mouth pain and ability to swallow. RESULTS: The results obtained demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the mean OMAS score in the DPP treatment group and the control group. Symptoms such as impairment of solid food intake observed with the control group were not observed in the DPP-treated group following the treatment. Reduction of mucositis severity of pain and ability to swallow were statistically significant in the DPP-treated group. CONCLUSION: DPP treatment reduced the incidence of mouth pain and oral ulcers that often require modifications to soft/liquid diet. The complex mixture of bioactive constituents contained in DPP may have protected the oral mucosa by blocking oxidative free radicals, preventing DNA damage, and neutralizing inflammatory reactions. Further randomized controlled studies are needed to validate DPP efficacy in the broader management of chemotherapy- and radiation-induced mucositis.",

Suspension of date palm pollen (DPP) is an herbal mixture that is widely used in folk medicine for male infertility. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of DPP suspension and extract on APH-induced rats. METHODS: APH was induced in adult castrated Wistar rats by both s.c. injection of testosterone (0.5 mg/rat/day) and smearing citral on shaved skin once every 3 days for 30 days. Saw palmetto (100mg/kg), DPP suspension (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg), and lyophilized DPP extract (150,300 and 600 mg/kg) were given orally daily for 30 days. All medications were started 7 days after castration and along with testosterone and citral. RESULTS: The histopathological feature in APH-induced prostate rats showed evidence of hyperplasia and inflammation. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the expressions of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IGF-1 and clusterin were increased, while the expression of TGF-β1 was decreased that correlates with presence of inflammation. Moreover, histopathological examination revealed increased cellular proliferation and reduced apoptosis in ventral prostate. Both saw palmetto and DPP treatment has ameliorated these histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in APH-induced rats. These improvements were not associated with reduction in the prostatic weight that may be attributed to the persistence of edema. CONCLUSION: DPP may have a potential protective effect in APH-induced Wistar rats through modulation of cytokine expression and/or upregulation of their autocrine/paracrine receptors."

Specific immunotherapy with allergenic extracts by subcutaneous route is effective to cure allergic people. However, the risk of side effects has led to explore safer therapeutic modalities. The aim of our work was to evaluate IgE cross-reactivity between DP and autochthonous palm (European fan palm, EFP) pollen extracts, to chemically modify DP extract with potassium cyanate in order to obtain an allergoid, and to characterize it. METHODS: By radioallergosorbent test inhibition, immunoblotting (IB) and skin prick test, in vitro and in vivo allergenic activities of native and modified DP extracts were compared. By SDS-PAGE and IB, we compared the protein profile and IgE-binding capacity of both native and modified DP, as well as of EFP extracts. By IB inhibition, IgE cross-reactivity of native DP and EFP extracts was evaluated. By ELISA, the capacity of modified DP-induced IgG to react with native DP extract was determined. RESULTS: Radioallergosorbent test inhibition, IB and skin prick test results demonstrated that modified DP was significantly less allergenic than native DP extract. The SDS-PAGE profile showed that potassium cyanate treatment of DP extract did not alter the molecular weight of its components. In addition, no difference was observed between native DP and EFP extracts. Subsequent IB inhibition data evidenced the existence of a strong IgE cross-reactivity between native DP and EFP extracts. ELISA results indicated that the administration of modified DP in mice was able to induce specific IgG also recognizing native DP extract. CONCLUSIONS: Modified DP extract (allergoid) seems to be a good candidate for immunotherapy of patients affected by specific allergy.",
