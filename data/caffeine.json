      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Hospitalization of moderately preterm infants may be prolonged while waiting for apnea of prematurity to resolve after discontinuing caffeine. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether extending caffeine treatment reduces the duration of hospitalization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From February 2019 to December 2022, this randomized clinical trial in 29 US hospitals enrolled infants born at 29 to 33 weeks' gestation who at 33 to 35 weeks' postmenstrual age were receiving caffeine treatment with plans to discontinue it plus receiving full feeds (≥120 mL/kg/d). Follow-up was completed on March 20, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Infants were randomized to oral caffeine citrate (10 mg/kg/d) or placebo until 28 days after discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was days to discharge after randomization. Secondary outcomes included days to physiological maturity (apnea free for 5 consecutive days, receiving full oral feeds, and out of the incubator for at least 48 hours), postmenstrual age at discharge, all-cause hospital readmissions, all-cause sick and emergency department visits, safety outcomes, and death. RESULTS: A total of 827 infants (median gestational age, 31 weeks; 414 female [51%]) were randomized (416, caffeine; 411, placebo) out of the 878 planned before reaching the prespecified futility threshold. Days of hospitalization after randomization did not differ between groups (18.0 days [IQR, 10 to 30 days] for caffeine vs 16.5 [IQR, 10 to 27 days] for placebo; adjusted median difference, 0 days [95% CI, -1.7 to 1.7 days]), nor did days to physiological maturity differ (14.0 vs 15.0 days, adjusted median difference, -1 day [95% CI, -2.4 to 0.4 days]). Infants receiving caffeine were apnea free sooner (6.0 vs 10.0 days; adjusted median difference, -2.7 days [95% CI, -3.4 to -2.0 days ]) but had similar days to full oral feeding (7.5 vs 6.0 days, adjusted median difference, 0 days [95% CI, -0.1 to 0.1]). Rates of readmissions and sick visits did not differ between groups. There was no statistically significant difference in adverse events between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In moderately preterm infants, continuation of caffeine treatment compared with placebo did not shorten hospitalization.

      "abstract": "The risk of PCOS is significantly increased in obese women, and studies have shown that weight loss can improve symptoms of PCOS. Coffee has been shown to be effective in reducing body weight. In this study, we focused on the SLC16A6 gene using bioinformatics and searched for coffee and its monomers using reverse network pharmacology. The gene expression omnibus (GEO) database was searched to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PCOS patients. Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were then performed. The effects of caffeine on body weight, estrous cycle, ovarian pathology, serum insulin concentration and insulin resistance index, and SLC16A6 transporter gene expression in ovarian tissue of obese PCOS rats were monitored. The common differentially expressed gene SLC16A6 was identified in this study, and animal experiments confirmed the efficacy of caffeine in the treatment of obese PCOS rats. Caffeine can effectively improve the symptoms of obese PCOS rats. The mechanism by which caffeine can treat obese patients with PCOS is related to increasing the expression of the SLC16A6 gene.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) constitutes a major global health concern and is the second foremost cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. This research investigated the anticancer effectiveness of caffeine-conjugated silver nanoparticles (Caf-AgNPs) against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, utilizing fluorouracil (5-FU) as a reference antitumor drug. The study illustrated that the strategic conjugation of caffeine with AgNPs substantially improved the therapeutic efficacy against breast cancer cell lines and simultaneously attenuated cytotoxicity in normal mouse liver (NBL) cells. Caf-AgNPs significantly increased ROS, malondialdehyde, COX-2, IL-1β, and TNF-α level in BC cells, which was accompanied by a decrease in glutathione levels. The increased levels of cytosolic cytochrome c, caspase-3, and Bax proteins, as well as a significant decrease in Bcl-2 expression and Bcl-2/Bax ratio, were indicative of the significant pro-apoptotic effects of Caf-AgNPs in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cancer cells subjected to Caf-AgNPs demonstrated elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) membrane leakage, signifying cellular membrane disruption. Cell cycle analysis revealed a substantial proportion of early and late stage apoptosis in cancer cells exposed to Caf-AgNPs, accompanied by a notable downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) mRNA expression. Caf-AgNPs utilize several mechanisms for cellular destruction, including cell cycle arrest, oxidative stress induction, modulation of the inflammatory response, and mitochondrial apoptosis. Caf-AgNPs offer a promising and complex strategy for breast cancer intervention."

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent a leading cause of premature mortality and disability worldwide, with their incidence expected to rise, potentially reaching 24 million deaths per year by 2030. These multifactorial diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, and heart failure, are often linked to metabolic disturbances such as diabetes, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. Natural compounds, such as caffeine, have been explored for their potential therapeutic effects on CVDs. Caffeine, found in coffee, tea, cocoa, and various energy drinks, is a widely consumed psychoactive compound with noted analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Despite its long history of use, caffeine's impact on cardiovascular health remains controversial, with both beneficial and harmful effects reported. This review examines the current literature on the effects of caffeine on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), with an emphasis on preclinical and clinical studies, its pharmacokinetic properties, and the molecular mechanisms it modulates. There is evidence that moderate caffeine intake can be beneficial for some CVDs, such as hypertension, while for other CVDs, such as dyslipidemia, the evidence collected so far suggests that caffeine intake could be detrimental since it increases total cholesterol levels. But variability in dosage, intake patterns, and individual factors (such as genetics and diet) complicates the reliability of results. Additionally, challenges related to dose standardization and the absence of consistent clinical trial designs hinder the full utilization of caffeine in CVD treatment. Nonetheless, caffeine appears to be safe for individuals without significant cardiovascular conditions. Future research should aim for well-designed studies with precise patient cohorts and standardized methodologies to better assess caffeine's role in CVD management."

      "abstract": "There is a positive causality between coffee consumption and osteoarthritis (OA); however, whether gut microbiota is involved needs to be discussed. Here, we observed that in caffeine consumers, fecal Prevotella copri abundance was positively correlated with subchondral bone mass, serum caffeine concentration was negatively correlated with bone mass, and fecal P. copri was negatively correlated with serum caffeine. In the OA model, caffeine intake aggravated articular cartilage destruction, bone mass loss, and intestinal barrier damage; on the contrary, paraxanthine intake reversed the above lesions. Importantly, after the intestinal P. copri supplement, caffeine-induced lesions in OA mice were effectively alleviated. Mechanically, P. copri has the potential to metabolize caffeine into paraxanthine, and this effect could alleviate the ferroptosis of osteoblast in the OA model. This study screened out that P. copri, an endogenous bacteria, has the ability to metabolize caffeine and revealed its effects on OA progression.IMPORTANCEThere is positive causality between coffee consumption and osteoarthritis (OA). Caffeine exposure is responsible for the reduction of bone mass and restrained osteoblast function. Prevotella copri abundance is exhausted in gut and positively correlated with subchondral bone mass in coffee consumption patients with OA. Supplement of intestinal P. copri alleviates caffeine-induced subchondral bone loss. P. copri has the potential to metabolize caffeine into paraxanthine, and this effect alleviates ferroptosis of osteoblast. Our study illustrated that intestinal P. copri possibly serves as a novel promising treatment for coffee consumers with OA."

      "abstract": "Coffee has become one of the most popular beverages worldwide due to the variety of bioactive compounds, which also play crucial roles against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little is known about how these defensive compounds are produced in coffee. Here, we found that the whole biosynthetic pathways and the production of caffeine and proanthocyanidins (PAs) were promoted under Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Co-expression data showed that some transcription factors were shared by caffeine and PA regulation, and further several candidate caffeine regulators were identified. The biosynthesis of monoterpene linalool was also triggered by MeJA, and the functions of coffee linalool synthase were characterized. Evolution and expression analyses revealed that the expression variation of linalool synthase is likely the major reason for the low linalool content in coffee leaves, despite of the linalool synthase expansion in coffee genome. Additionally, the JA signaling key regulator MYC2 could directly bind to and activate the promoter of linalool synthase to regulate linalool biosynthesis."

      "abstract": "Green tea (Camellia sinensis L.), one of the most popular beverages worldwide, contains caffeine, a natural stimulant. However, some green tea extracts have been known to possess both hypnotic and arousal effects. This study aimed to identify the components influencing these dual effects using a green tea ethanol extract (GE). Response surface methodology revealed that only some extraction conditions significantly induced arousal effects in ICR mice during the pentobarbital-induced sleep test. Among these, extraction with 95% ethanol for 195 minutes achieved the maximum arousal effect, corresponding to a caffeine content of 58.9 mg g-1, comparable to the effects observed with the reference, 25 mg kg-1 of caffeine. In addition, administration of this GE sample significantly increased wakefulness for 3 hours following treatment in C57BL/6N mice, as confirmed through sleep architecture analysis. A correlation analysis of the total phenolic content (TPC) to caffeine ratio in GE found that the intensity of the arousal-inducing effects varied with TPC (R2 = 0.9428). It was also confirmed that the ratio of EGCG to caffeine, major components of GE, was more closely associated with sleep duration (R2 = 0.9034). L-Theanine, known for its sleep-promoting effects, did not independently affect the arousal effects of GE. However, when combined with EGCG, their total content showed a slightly stronger correlation with sleep duration in relation to the caffeine ratio, compared with that of EGCG/caffeine ratio (R2 = 0.9464). Therefore, the balance between TPC and caffeine appears to modulate the stimulant properties of GE, highlighting its potential as both a stimulant and a mild hypnotic agent. Collectively, these findings provide insights into optimizing GE for tailored functional foods based on its polyphenol/caffeine ratio."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Compared with normal hearts, failing hearts are more vulnerable to develop atrial fibrillation under sympathetic stimulation. It has been shown that dobutamine and caffeine challenge can induce spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias in normal hearts. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate whether failing hearts have increased vulnerability to dobutamine- and caffeine-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and whether dantrolene treatment provides therapeutic benefits in this condition. METHODS: A myocardial infarction (MI)-heart failure (HF) rat model was used 2 months after surgery. Sham-surgery animals served as the control animals. MI-HF rats were randomized into MI-HF untreated and MI-HF dantrolene-treated groups. Dobutamine (25 μg/kg, intraperitoneal [IP]) and caffeine (50 mg/kg, IP) were administered acutely to induce ventricular arrhythmias. MI-HF-dantrolene group received dantrolene (10 mg/kg, IP) 30 minutes before the arrhythmia test. Spontaneous Ca2+ sparks in isolated ventricular myocytes from control and MI-HF rats were also examined. RESULTS: Dobutamine induced less inotropic response in MI-HF rats than in control rats. Dobutamine + caffeine induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 9 of 10 MI-HF rats, while no ventricular arrhythmia was induced in the control rats (P < .01). Dantrolene treatment significantly decreased ventricular arrhythmia inducibility (n = 2 of 10, P < .05) in MI-HF rats. In isolated ventricular myocytes, Ca2+ sparks were significantly increased in MI-HF rats, and dantrolene treatment decreased Ca2+ sparks in these animals. CONCLUSION: Although dobutamine evoked less inotropic effects, failing hearts were more vulnerable to dobutamine and caffeine-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Dantrolene treatment decreased Ca2+ sparks in isolated ventricular myocytes from failing hearts and ameliorated ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by dobutamine and caffeine in MI-HF rats in vivo."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As sprinting gains popularity, enhancing anaerobic capacity, neuromuscular function, and cognitive performance is crucial. This study evaluated the effects of Total Motion Release (TMR) and caffeine on these functions in male sprinters to optimize performance strategies. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 56 male sprinters were randomly assigned to control, caffeine, TMR, or caffeine plus TMR groups. The Stroop test, Eriksen flanker task, FMS, and Wingate test were used pre- and post-intervention, with effects analyzed via within- and between-group comparisons. RESULTS: Flanker congruent and incongruent reaction times significantly decreased with caffeine, TMR, or the combination of both (p < 0.05), with caffeine showing the greatest effect on congruent reaction times (p < 0.05). All groups except the control improved their FMS scores, but no group was significantly superior. Peak, average, and relative peak power increased in all groups except the caffeine group (p > 0.05), with no group outperforming the others. Heart rate showed a slight increase in the group receiving both caffeine and TMR (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Caffeine increases cognitive function, while TMR boosts accuracy, power, and neuromuscular function. Combined, they improve cognitive performance and reduce reaction times. TMR improves anaerobic capacity; caffeine has minimal impact. Caffeine may be better for those without sensitivity, while TMR can support neuromuscular readiness, power, and accuracy. TMR is recommended, especially for high-acceleration sports. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with the IRCT committee (No: IRCT20230708058720N1, March 13, 2024).",

In this experiment, the duration of farrowing was affected by the induction technique, as the PGF2α SD and PGF2α SD + caffeine treatment groups reduced this time by as much as 100 min compared to PGF2α FD and PGF2α FD + caffeine. The groups that received caffeine presented the best values for the indicators of the neonate performance, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), glucose, surface temperature at 24 h, and weight at 21 days, especially the PGF2α SD + caffeine group. PGF2α FD had the lowest neonate performance and metabolic variables. Inducing birth with PGF2α SD is more efficient, and adding caffeine improves the performance and metabolic variables of piglets born from primiparous sows."

      "abstract": "Several in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rely on 2D cell culture, and, more recently, 3D cultures represented by free-floating neurospheres have been used as models for the disease. The advantage of 3D over 2D cell culture is that cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions can be assessed, better representing the molecular and cellular hallmarks of the disease. In the current study, we developed two complementary 3D neurosphere models using SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to investigate AD pathology and evaluate potential therapies. First, self-assembled neurospheres were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs), inducing AD-like features such as increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), amyloid aggregation, and apoptosis. Treatment with caffeine or photobiomodulation (PBM) using LED irradiation significantly reduced Aβ1-42 accumulation, ROS generation, and decreased apoptosis markers. Second, 3D bioprinting of SH-SY5Y cells resulted in neurospheres with enhanced cellular organization and differentiation. These findings emphasize the advantages of 3D models for studying neurodegeneration and evaluating therapeutic strategies, bridging the gap between traditional 2D cultures and complex in vitro systems."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: This study aimed to explore the effects of sleep restriction of ≤5 h within 24 h on anaerobic and aerobic performance in male college soccer players and evaluated the effects of acute supplementation of 3 mg⋅kg-1 caffeine on the aerobic and anaerobic performance of college male soccer players under sleep restriction. METHODS: 10 college male soccer players were recruited, and a randomized crossover experimental design was adopted. The subjects received three intervention treatments in a randomized crossover order: Normal sleep night (NSN), sleep restriction night supplemented with placebo (SRP), and sleep restriction night supplemented with 3 mg⋅kg-1 caffeine (SRC), and participated in the Running-Based Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST) and 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (30-15IFT). RESULTS: The main effect of the RAST and the 30-15IFT scores was significant (P<0.05). Post hoc analyses showed that the peak power, mean power, peak power/body mess, mean power/body mess, peak velocity mean velocity, fatigue index of the RAST, and the velocity of the intermittent fitness test (VIFT), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), and time to exhaustion (TTE) of the 30-15IFT in the SRP group were significantly lower than those of the NSN group (P < 0.05), and the total time of the RAST was significantly higher than that of the NSN group (P < 0.05); there were significant differences between the VIFT, VO2max and TTE indicators tested at 30-15IFT between the SRC group and the SRP group (P < 0.05). Still, other indicators had no significant differences (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Sleep restriction harms the anaerobic repeated sprint and aerobic performance of college soccer players; acute supplementation of 3 mg⋅kg-1 of caffeine can effectively reduce the negative impact of insufficient sleep the night before on the aerobic endurance performance of college soccer players. Athletes or coaches should consider caffeine supplementation as a strategy to alleviate the negative impacts of sleep deprivation, but individual tolerance and potential side effects should be taken into account."

      "abstract": "Total sleep deprivation (TSD) alters local cold tolerance and could thus increase the risk of cold injury. We evaluated the impact of acute caffeine intake, the main countermeasure to TSD-related deleterious effects, on local cold tolerance before and after TSD. Thirty-six healthy subjects underwent two TSD protocols (i.e., continuous wakefulness), with randomized crossover intake of acute caffeine or placebo (2.5 mg/kg) administered twice during wakefulness. Before and after 33 h of TSD, finger (index and annular) temperature and skin blood flow were assessed during cold-water immersion (CWI, 5°C, 20 min) followed by 20 min of rewarming in ambient air. We showed no significant effects of TSD on mean finger temperature during CWI in the placebo condition, but a significant reduction of the minimal temperature (8.86°C ± 0.35°C vs. 8.64°C ± 0.27°C, p = 0.02). During rewarming, we showed a reduction in temperature in the placebo condition (p = 0.02 for the mean temperature and p = 0.03 for the maximal) and an increase in the skin blood flow disparity between fingers at the four points of laser speckle rewarming measurements (p = 0.03). After TSD, acute caffeine intake (vs. placebo) increased mean (+2.11°C ± 0.21°C, p = 0.01) and minimal (+0.61°C ± 0.10°C, p = 0.02) finger temperatures during CWI, and improved rewarming after CWI (mean and maximal temperatures) (+2.28°C ± 0.08°C, p = 0.01, and +2.06°C ± 0.12°C, p = 0.02, respectively). Before TSD, acute caffeine intake significantly increased (vs. placebo) mean temperatures during CWI (p = 0.03) and reduced pain from the onset (p = 0.03) to the end of CWI (p = 0.02) and the first 2 min of rewarming (p = 0.04). There was also a significant main effect of habitual daily caffeine consumption on minimal finger temperatures during CWI, which decreased significantly between 0 and 600 mg consumption (R2 = -0.43, p = 0.01), independently of the effects of day (before and after TSD) and treatment (caffeine and placebo conditions). These findings suggest that acute caffeine intake could be a protective countermeasure to local cold tolerance, particularly during TSD. However, habitual daily caffeine consumption is a factor of individual variability that should be recorded during CWI protocols. Clinical trial NCT03859882."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Caffeine is a proven medication used for the prevention and treatment of apnea in premature infants, offering both short- and long-term benefits. International guidelines provide a range of recommendations regarding the preterm population eligible for caffeine prophylaxis, including the timing, dosage, and duration of treatment. Our national guidelines, published prior to the most recent updates of the international guidelines, recommend the use of caffeine citrate starting from the first day after delivery for preterm infants with a gestational age of <28 weeks. For infants up to 32 weeks, if positive pressure ventilation is required, the decision should be made on an individual basis. This study aims to describe the variability in caffeine usage across neonatal intensive care units in our country. METHODS: An online survey was sent to neonatologist who are members of the Turkish Neonatology Society to describe the variability in caffeine usage in neonatal intensive care units in our country. RESULTS: We collected responses from 74 units. Prophylactic caffeine usage was observed as; GA ≤276/7: 98.6%, GA 280/7-286/7: 89.0%, GA 290/7-296/7: 75.3%, GA 300/7-316/7: 53.4%. 62.2% of units reported administering loading dose within the first two hours. The initial maintenance dose was 5 mg/kg in 64.8% of units, 10 mg/kg in 32.4% of units, and intermediate dose in 5.3% of units. 47.3% of units reported no routine dose adjustment. The postmenstrual age that caffeine treatment was stopped was found to be 34 (min-max; 32-36) weeks for infants without apnea and respiratory support, 36 (min-max; 34-52) weeks for infants without apnea but any respiratory support. The time to discharge after treatment cessation was found as; 1-4 days: 37.8%, 5-7 days: 68.9%. Among the 56 units with multiple responsible physicians, 32.1% reported intra-unit variations. CONCLUSION: The significant differences in caffeine usage characteristics between and within units highlight the need for clear recommendations provided by standardized guidelines."

      "abstract": "Apnea is a major complication of acute respiratory tract infection in young infants and may lead to the need for ventilatory support. Caffeine is methylxanthine, which is considered the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for apnea of prematurity. On the basis of neonatal guidelines, caffeine has been used as a respiratory stimulant for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection-related apnea, despite low evidence of its ability to improve clinical outcomes. Hyperlactatemia has been reported in adults with caffeine poisoning. Clarithromycin acts as an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 and may impair drug metabolism. However, there are no published data concerning lactic acidosis associated with caffeine-clarithromycin coadministration. We report a case of hyperlactatemia in a young infant born prematurely who presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory tract infection-associated apnea and who required noninvasive ventilatory support. Because respiratory viruses were not detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates and the chest radiography revealed interstitial opacities, clarithromycin (15mg/kg/day) was started via a nasoduodenal tube. In polysomnography, dysmaturity and immaturity of the central nervous system were evident. Hence, caffeine treatment was initiated at a loading dose of 10mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 5mg/kg/day. After treatment initiation, the child experienced ventilatory improvement and apnea control. However, a progressive increase in the serum lactate concentration and high anion gap metabolic acidosis were observed, despite hemodynamic stability. Following discontinuation of both drugs, the serum concentrations of lactate gradually returned to normal values. Thus, clarithromycin-caffeine coadministration may cause a sharp increase in lactate concentrations and should be avoided in young infants with acute respiratory tract infection-associated apnea.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is well established that therapeutic hypothermia improves outcomes for infants with moderate-severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in high-income counties. However, ∼29% of the infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia still have adverse outcome. Additionally, therapeutic hypothermia is not recommended as a treatment for infants with HIE in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments for infants with HIE in low- and middle-income countries, as well as additive treatments to therapeutic hypothermia in high-income countries. SUMMARY: Caffeine is widely used as an agent to prevent apnea in preterm infants, and more recently, it has been investigated as a potential neuroprotective treatment for perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury, but the preclinical evidence so far has been mixed. Furthermore, there are concerns that caffeine, which is an adenosine receptor antagonist, could abolish the endogenous neuroprotective effects of adenosine, during and after HI. KEY MESSAGES: Further studies using caffeine particularly in large animal translational models of HI brain injury are required to establish the safety and efficacy of caffeine for HIE before conducting large randomized controlled trials."

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the potential synergistic effects of low dose of CAF and warm-up music on subsequent taekwondo combat outcomes. METHODS: In a double-blinded, randomized, crossover study, 16 male taekwondo athletes performed simulated combats under six conditions: (a) control, (b) CAF without music (CAF + NM), (c) placebo without music (PL + NM), (d) CAF with music (CAF + M), (e) PL with music (PL + M), and (f) no supplement with music (NS + M). After warming-up, athletes rated their felt arousal (FAS). Perceived exertion (RPE), feeling scale (FS), FAS, and physical enjoyment (PACES) were determined after combat while mean (HRmean) and peak (HRpeak) heart rate were determined for each bout. Each combat was analyzed to determine time-motion aspects and technical-tactical skills. RESULTS: CAF + M shortened skip and pause times than CAF and music in single-use (p < 0.05), while extend attack time than other conditions (p < 0.001). Additionally, CAF + M increased attacks and defensive actions above that of single treatment conditions (all p < 0.05). Moreover, CAF + M improved FS and FAS post-combat than the other conditions (p < 0.001) and PACES compared to NS + M, PL + NM and PL + M conditions (p < 0.05). Similarly, CAF + M reduced HRmean and HRpeak than the other conditions (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Combining low dose of CAF and warm-up music could be an effective strategy to enhance taekwondo combat performance in male athletes."

The primary outcomes were the incidence of BPD, severe BPD, and mortality. RESULTS: Eleven studies (1 RCT and 10 cohorts) with 64,749 patients (34,175 early and 30,574 late) were included. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower incidence of BPD (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.79; P < 0.00001) but higher mortality (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.29; P < 0.00001) in the early group.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairment, glial-mediated inflammation, redox imbalance, and α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation. Conventional therapies relieve early PD symptoms, but they do not repair dopaminergic neurons. Berberine (BBR) and caffeine (CAF), both natural alkaloids, exhibited neuroprotective effects in many neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, we hypothesized that the combination of BBR and CAF therapies would offer protection against PD-related impairments in the rotenone (ROT)-induced rat model when compared to the commercial drug, metformin (MTF). Our results showed that the combined administration of BBR (25 mg/kg/day) and CAF (2.5 mg/kg/day) for four weeks prevented motor deficits, weight reduction, dopamine (DA) depletion, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in ROT-induced rats in comparison with monotherapy of BBR and CAF along with MTF. This combination produced a notable neuroprotective effect by reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin-16 (IL-6) in midbrain of rats. BBR and CAF combinations markedly normalized tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels and decreased total α-syn and α-syn-pser129 aggregation and increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) levels. Histological analysis indicated that damaged neurons exhibited significant amelioration with the co-administration of BBR and CAF. The molecular docking results indicated that both BBR and CAF had notable binding affinity for the protein pocket surrounding the α-syn, PP2A, and TH in comparison to MTF. They are predicted to serve as effective inhibitors of enzyme-mediated phosphorylation of α-syn-pser129. Conclusively, combined BBR and CAF administration presents a novel strategy for neuroprotection by blocking the initial events in PD incidence, demonstrating considerable anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory benefits relative to MTF.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is considered a pollutant that threatens aquatic life and human well-being, and its anaerobic treatment is typically a slow process. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) present a sustainable alternative by enabling caffeine degradation while simultaneously generating electricity. This study investigates the anaerobic degradation of caffeine using MFCs as a sustainable wastewater treatment approach under various operational conditions. A two-chambered MFC was established employing synthetic wastewater, sodium acetate as the carbon source, and anaerobic sludge as inoculum. Various concentrations of acetate (0.375 and 1 g/L) and caffeine (10 and 20 mg/L) with and without an external nitrogen source, ammonium chloride, were evaluated for power generation and caffeine degradation efficiency. Results demonstrate that caffeine degradation achieves 100% in 5 days when coupled with external nitrogen sources, whereas degradation without external nitrogen achieves the same within 3 days for both caffeine concentrations. Furthermore, increasing the caffeine loading concentration results in a maximum power density of 5.64, 9.37, and 11.83 mW/m2, respectively, for 10 and 20 mg/L caffeine concentrations. Additionally, when the acetate concentration was increased to 1 mg/L without external nitrogen, degradation of 10 and 20 mg/L caffeine requires 3 and 5 days respectively, with a maximum power density of 12.8 mW/m2. This investigation underscores the potential of anaerobic bacteria to degrade caffeine utilising it as a nitrogen source while also contributing to power generation in MFCs. Moreover, the results highlight the significant influence of operational parameters on caffeine degradation efficiency and power generation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Caffeine citrate is an example of a methylxanthine approved for managing apnea of prematurity (AOP). However, there is limited evidence of its use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This rapid systematic review aims to appraise the literature on using caffeine citrate in managing neonatal apnea in LMICs. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted on literature reporting the treatment of AOP in LMICs. The search was based on a population, intervention, comparison, and outcome format using medical subject heading terms. The PRISMA and PRISMA extension for scoping reviews guidelines were meticulously followed. PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus were among the bibliographic databases searched. Initially, 2638 articles were identified based on the keywords used. However, after eliminating duplicates and implementing advanced options (only full-text, language, and year), the articles were further screened by abstract and title, ensuring a rigorous selection process. RESULTS: The evaluation of 10 studies involving 1010 preterm infants provided compelling evidence. Our findings demonstrated that caffeine citrate, compared to aminophylline, had fewer adverse effects. The adverse effects, including feeding intolerance, tachycardia, central nervous system derailment, and hyperglycemia, were significantly reduced with caffeine citrate. Furthermore, data from the included studies revealed that caffeine citrate had a lower risk of recurrent apnea and was less likely to fall out of the recommended therapeutic range than aminophylline. These results unequivocally establish caffeine citrate's safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness in treating prematurity apnea in LMICs, providing a reliable and beneficial intervention for neonatal care in these regions. CONCLUSION: Caffeine may be a preferred option in managing AOP in LMICs. However, high drug prices and lack of availability of caffeine may be factors limiting its use in these settings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current studies have examined the efficacy of opioid-sparing analgesics primarily in adult surgical populations, while fewer guide pediatric postoperative pain treatment. Caffeine exerts most of its biological effects by binding to adenosine receptors, which are important for modifying pain and inflammation. Caffeine's ability to modulate pain following posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has not been previously assessed. METHODS: The hospital investigational drug study (IDS) pharmacy provided either a treatment dose or placebo dose of caffeine to be given to the patient and was also in charge of randomization for the study. RESULTS: There were 24 patients in the caffeine group (mean 14.3±1.5 years, 91.7% female) and 27 in the control group (mean 14.8±1.4 years, 88.9% female). Postoperative opioid usage was lower in the caffeine cohort for POD 1 (18.6 MME vs. 21.6 MME; p=.19), but this difference was not statistically significant. Opioid usage decreased in the caffeine study group for POD 1 (caffeine: 0.35 MME/kg vs. 0.4 MME/kg; p=.19) and mean daily total opioid usage over the hospital stay (caffeine: 0.32 MME/kg vs. 0.37 MME/kg; p=1), but these differences were not statistically significant. The caffeine study group demonstrated a mean reduction in total opioid consumption over the hospital stay of 5 MME. CONCLUSIONS: Oral caffeine use resulted in an average reduction of 5 MME opioid consumption, equivalent to 5 mg of hydrocodone. While this trial was underpowered to definitively assess the outcome, oral caffeine shows potential as an adjunct medication for opioid stewardship in AIS patients. This trial's reported mean total oral opioid consumption range of 0.83 to 0.92 MME/kg is lower than the amounts typically observed in clinical trials. This finding could indicate a successful strategy in reducing opioid use, which aligns with current medical efforts for opioid stewardship."

      "abstract": "Exposure to elevated inspired carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, an environmental threat in several occupational settings, is known to induce systemic hypercapnia and provoke headache. However, the impact of CO2 exposure dose on headache severity has not been determined, and countermeasures to mitigate systemic hypercapnia and headache during CO2 exposure are lacking. In this study, we first characterized respiratory responses and headache with graded CO2 exposure (sequential 12-min stages of 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% inspired CO2, all with 21% oxygen) during seated rest in 24 healthy males and females. As expected, graded CO2 exposure resulted in stepwise increases (41 ± 3, 43 ± 2, 46 ± 2, 53 ± 2, 65 ± 1 mmHg; P < 0.001) in end-tidal CO2 across the spectrum from normocapnia to severe hypercapnia. Headache increased (P < 0.05) beginning at 4% inspired CO2 (1 ± 2, 2 ± 3, 8 ± 8, 16 ± 13, 32 ± 20 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale). Participants then completed the same graded CO2 exposure 1 h following either caffeine (400 mg) or placebo supplementation in a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner (n = 23). Caffeine increased ventilation and lowered end-tidal CO2 at inspired CO2 levels between 0% and 6% (P < 0.05), corresponding with a leftward shift in the end-tidal CO2-ventilation response curve with unchanged slope. Caffeine substantially reduced headache during graded CO2 exposure, an effect that was most pronounced at 8% inspired CO2 (placebo: 25 ± 15 mm, caffeine: 13 ± 12 mm; P < 0.05). Our novel findings establish prophylactic caffeine supplementation as a translational countermeasure to mitigate systemic hypercapnia and headache during CO2 exposure.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we first characterized systemic hypercapnia and headache severity during graded CO2 exposures (sequential 12-min stages of 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% inspired CO2). Using a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, we then showed that prophylactic treatment with 400 mg caffeine mitigates systemic hypercapnia and headache during graded CO2 exposure. Overall, these novel findings establish caffeine as the first evidence-based countermeasure to mitigate adverse effects associated with CO2 exposure.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Hair loss (alopecia or effluvium) can significantly affect the self-esteem and psychosocial well-being of patients, resulting in a reduced quality of life. It may herald a systemic disease, nutritional deficiency, or side effects of pharmacotherapy. Current therapeutic options for hair loss are not always satisfactory and may be associated with considerable side effects; therefore, new solutions are still sought. Caffeine seems to be an effective agent against hair loss thanks to its stimulating effects on cell growth and good penetration into the hair follicle. The aim of this study was to systematically review published clinical trials of topical caffeine preparations against hair loss. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for clinical trials investigating the efficacy of topical caffeine products in hair loss, published until 29 November 2024. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE classification. Results: The query returned 1121 articles, of which 9 ultimately met the inclusion criteria. In total, 684 people with androgenetic alopecia, excessive hair loss, or hair thinning were included in these trials. In all studies, conclusions were in favor of topical caffeine treatment; however, the level of scientific evidence was medium in 3 studies, low in 1, and very low in the remaining 5. Their major flaws included the lack of randomization and placebo and control groups, as well as the lack of information on the caffeine concentration in the topical products. Conclusions: Results from studies published to date suggest that topical caffeine preparations are safe and effective against hair loss. Nevertheless, better-designed clinical trials of well-defined caffeine products are required for an ultimate statement. Commercial hair products with caffeine offered on the market nowadays may be worth a try, but due to incomplete scientific data and product information, satisfactory outcomes are not guaranteed."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ferroptosis, a regulated cell death pathway driven by lipid peroxidation and iron overload, is implicated in neuronal injury caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Caffeine, a widely consumed psychoactive compound, has shown neuroprotective effects in various central nervous system disorders, but its role in regulating ferroptosis remains unclear. This study investigates the neuroprotective effects of caffeine on ferroptosis and its regulation of ACSL4, a key ferroptosis-related protein. METHODS: Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the interaction between caffeine and ferroptosis-related proteins ACSL4 and GPX4. HT-22 cells were subjected to H/R to establish an in vitro injury model, followed by treatment with caffeine at varying concentrations. ACSL4 was silenced or overexpressed to explore its role in caffeine-mediated ferroptosis regulation. Cell viability, inflammatory cytokines, ferroptosis markers, and mitochondrial function were assessed. RESULTS: Molecular docking revealed favorable binding affinities of caffeine with ACSL4 (-5.6 kcal/mol) and GPX4 (-4.6 kcal/mol). Caffeine treatment dose-dependently improved cell viability, reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels, and inhibited ferroptosis by downregulating ACSL4 and upregulating GPX4. Overexpression of ACSL4 reversed these protective effects, increasing lipid peroxidation markers (iron, Fe2+, ROS, and MDA) and reducing GSH levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, silencing ACSL4 enhanced caffeine's protective effects, confirming its role as a critical target of caffeine-mediated ferroptosis inhibition. CONCLUSION: Caffeine protects against H/R-induced neuronal injury by regulating ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight ACSL4 as a therapeutic target and provide mechanistic insights into caffeine's neuroprotective potential.",

      "abstract": "Mucociliary clearance, the ability of the respiratory tract to protect the integrity of the airways through the mechanical removal of potentially harmful substances, is of enormous importance during intensive care treatment. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of clinically relevant inotropic agents on mucociliary clearance. The particle transport velocity (PTV) of isolated murine tracheae was measured as a surrogate for mucociliary clearance in the presence of dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone. Inhibitory substances were applied to elucidate the signal transduction cascades and the value and origin of calcium ions which provoke alterations in mucociliary clearance function. Dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone increased the PTV in a dose-dependent manner with half maximal effective concentrations of 75.7 nM, 87.0 nM, and 13.7 µM, respectively. After the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, no increase in PTV was observed after administering any of the three inotropic agents. While dobutamine and epinephrine activated β-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine used both the phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathway to promote the release of intracellular Ca2+. However, dobutamine primarily acted on the PKA pathway, having only a minor influence on the PLC pathway. The induced changes in PTV following milrinone administration required both the PKA and PLC pathway, although the PKA pathway was responsible for most of the induced changes. In conclusion, the common inotropic agents dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone increase murine PTV in a concentration-dependent manner and ultimately release Ca2+ from intracellular calcium stores, suggesting the function of changes in mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract.",

Caffeine may be an important adjunct to cooling and provide neuroprotection via its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. This study aimed to characterize caffeine pharmacokinetics in term infants with HIE receiving cooling. In this phase 1, dose-escalating study, enrolled infants received IV caffeine 20 mg/kg followed by up to two daily doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM (v7.5). The effects of clinical covariates, including cooling, on pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated. Dosing simulations were performed to evaluate the percentage of plasma exposures in the reference range (15-25 mg/L). Seventeen infants were included in model development. A one-compartment model best fit the data. Population clearance was 0.445 L/h/70 kg and volume of distribution was 87.1 L/70 kg. Current dosing regimens (20 mg/kg followed by 5 mg/kg) resulted in 89.5% of infants having at least one simulated exposure below the reference range across the dosing interval. Dosing regimens of 30 mg/kg followed by 5 or 10 mg/kg were predicted to result in more than half of infants achieving simulated exposures in the reference range, with ≤20% of infants having simulated exposures in the toxic range (>46 mg/L). Term infants with HIE had similar weight-normalized clearance but higher weight-normalized volume of distribution compared to prior studies in preterm infants without HIE or cooling. While exposure targets for neuroprotection in HIE are unknown, this phase 1 study suggests alternate dosing strategies should be considered in future studies."

METHODS: Swiss male mice received rotenone (1.5 mg/kg, s.c, three times per week) alone or with other drugs for 2 weeks. Mice were evaluated for brain malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and nitric oxide (NO), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), interlukin-1beta (IL-1β), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1). Histopathologic examination was also done. RESULTS: Cticholine co-treatment at 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg significantly decreased brain MDA and increased PON-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. When given at 200 mg/kg, it also significantly decreased NO production, while at 100 and 200 mg/kg significantly increased GSH brain. MCP-1 significantly decreased upon treatment with 100 or 200 mg/kg of citicholine. IL-1 β and NF-κB significantly decreased and AChE significantly increased by 200 mg/kg citicholine. Oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers also showed favorable changes after Vit E, caffeine or L-dopa. However, the combination of Vit E and/or caffeine with 100 mg/kg citicholine was not superior to that of only citicholine at 100 or 200 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: Citicholine is neuroprotective in acute rotenone nigrostriatal degeneration via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is suggested that citicholine may have a role in treatment of Parkinson's disease by decreasing neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress, preventing the development of neuronal damage."

The incidences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (P=0.012) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) (P=0.005) in the high-dose group were decreased compared with those in the low-dose group, with statistically significant differences. Long-term efficacy: the motor and mental development scores at 12 months of age in the high-dose group were increased compared with those in the low-dose group (P<0.05); and cost-effect analysis: there was no significant difference in the total hospitalization cost between the two group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: High maintenance dose of citrate caffeine in the treatment of AOP significantly reduces the number of apnea events, oxygen inhalation duration, the incidence of BPD and PVL, and positively affects the long-term neurological and motor development, without a significant increase in the hospitalization cost."

Treatment options vary based on the type and may include medications and topical solutions like TrichoSol™, which enhances hair growth through specialized technology. Personalized medicine and compounding pharmacies are crucial in tailoring treatments to individual needs. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of TrichoSol™ with multiple active ingredients to support its use in compounded alopecia therapies. For this purpose, compatibility studies were performed using stability-indicating methods to determine the beyond-use dates (BUDs) of compounded formulations within TrichoSol™. The results demonstrates that: metronidazole, caffeine, and triamcinolone are stable for 180 days; 17-a-estradiol is stable for 150 days, while spironolactone lasts 120 days; clobetasol propionate is stable for 90 days, and both finasteride, tretinoin, and melatonin are stable for 60 days in TrichoSol™, all at room temperature. Therefore, TrichoSol™ offers a practical compounding vehicle for these active pharmaceutical ingredients in a liquid topical formulation.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is an FDA-approved drug for preventing and treating apnea in preterm infants. However, the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of caffeine in preterm infants differ significantly from those in adults. Several population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models have been developed to investigate potential covariates influencing PK parameters. This review aimed to summarize PopPK studies of caffeine in preterm infants and explore the identified influencing covariates. It has been observed that most caffeine pharmacokinetics followed a one-compartment model (1-CMT), although one study utilized a three-compartment model (3-CMT). Various covariates including birth weight, current weight, genetic polymorphism, combination medications, feeding patterns, and pathological conditions have been identified to affect caffeine PK parameters in preterm infants. Developing an individualized dosing regimen for preterm infants is essential for safe and effective treatment. Future PopPK studies of caffeine in preterm infants should focus on sampling and feeding patterns and further explore the effects of other covariates like gestational and postnatal age on caffeine PK parameters, which should be taken into account in the individualized dosing regimen of caffeine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in neonates is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, longer hospitalization, and a higher risk for future kidney damage. Caffeine treatment has reportedly been associated with a decreased AKI occurrence. However, previous studies lack uniformity regarding dosage and timing of administration. This study aimed to assess AKI incidence in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants (< 1500 g) treated with early high-dose caffeine and to identify risk factors associated with AKI. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of VLBW preterm infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. All VLBW infants born < 32 weeks of gestation were treated with a standardized caffeine regimen (20 mg/kg bolus; in the first hour of life, maintenance 10 mg/kg/day). Maternal and infant data including clinical, demographic, and laboratory measurements were retrieved from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Of 311 VLBW infants admitted, all had adequate serum creatinine and urine output data. Of 301 patients included for analysis, 41 (14%) were diagnosed with AKI, while only 12/301 (4%) were diagnosed during the first week of life. Sixteen infants (5%) had > 1 AKI episode. Seven (7/41, 17%) had AKI stage 1 and seventeen infants (17/41, 42%) had stages 2 and 3. In univariate analysis, sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and hemodynamic instability during the first week of life were more prevalent in the AKI group. Infants with AKI were born with lower birth weights, at earlier gestational weeks, and had lower APGAR and higher CRIB II scores. NEC was the only significant risk factor associated with AKI in multivariate analysis. They also had a higher risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), longer hospitalization, and higher mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AKI in a cohort of VLBW infants universally treated early with caffeine was 14%, while only 4% had AKI during the first week. Infants with AKI had worse outcomes (BPD and mortality) and longer hospitalization.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine (CAFF) is abundant in black coffee. As one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, coffee has been the focus of increasing clinical and basic research, particularly regarding its benefits in alleviating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, the therapeutic effects of CAFF on metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFF potently reduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and early-stage liver fibrosis in MASH mice induced by prolonged (36 weeks) high-fat high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diets and high-fat diets combined with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injections. By using multiple target-identifying strategies, including surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay, we identified dual-specificity phosphatase 9 (Dusp9) as a key therapeutic target, which was diminished by HFHC but restored with CAFF treatment. Dusp9 knockdown in vivo and in vitro exacerbated glycolipid metabolism disorders and stunningly counteracted the systemic therapeutic effects of CAFF in the MASH models. In addition, CAFF inactivated the ASK1-p38/JNK, a downstream signaling pathway of Dusp9, which regulates inflammation and apoptosis. Our study highlights the multifaceted benefits of CAFF in treating MASH by rescuing hepatic Dusp9 expression, thereby reversing glycolipid metabolism disorders, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. These findings provide experimental evidence supporting the clinical and daily use of CAFF and black coffee in managing MASH patients.",

METHODS: A 10-year retrospective cohort study was conducted on asthmatic children unresponsive to beta2-agonists and steroids, who were treated with either intravenous caffeine citrate or magnesium sulphate. The study outcomes were changes in the Paediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) score, duration of oxygen therapy and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length-of-stay. RESULTS: Overall, 296 children were treated in the PICU between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2020. Fifteen and 26 children unresponsive to beta2-agonists and steroids (median ages 2.3 [0.7-11] and 3.0 [1.2-8.5] years), respectively, received caffeine citrate and magnesium sulphate. The two groups showed similar demographic characteristics and baseline parameters. At 24 and 48 h, the median (IQR) PRAM scores for the caffeine and magnesium groups were 4 (2-6) and 5 (4-6), respectively (p = 0.27), and 7 (6-8) and 8 (5-9), respectively (p = 0.57). The median (IQR) durations of PICU stay for the caffeine and magnesium groups were 36 (19-46) and 32 (23-45) h, respectively (p = 0.77). The median (IQR) durations of oxygen therapy for the caffeine and magnesium groups were 25 (10-30) and 20 (15-30) h, respectively (p = 0.29). No serious adverse events occurred in the caffeine group. One occurred in the magnesium group. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine citrate and magnesium sulphate demonstrated comparable effectiveness in treating steroid- and beta2-agonist-resistant asthma. A multicentre prospective study is needed to validate these results.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine consumption is regarded as a widespread phenomenon, and its usage has continued to increase. In addition, the growing usage of antidepressants worldwide and increase in mental health disorders were shown in recent statistical analyses conducted by the World Health Organisation. The coadministration of caffeine and antidepressants remains a concern due to potential interactions that can alter a patient's response to therapy. This review investigates the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between caffeine and the five main classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and other antidepressants not categorised by class, which we have categorised as 'miscellaneous'. The interaction between fluvoxamine and caffeine resulted in increased concentrations of caffeine in the body and lowered the renal clearance of fluvoxamine. Other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and escitalopram had augmented antidepressant effects by decreasing their renal clearance and prolonging their effects in the body when coadministered with caffeine. Caffeine may also increase the concentration of paroxetine, potentially affecting its pharmacodynamic effects. TCAs such as clomipramine, imipramine, desipramine, and sertraline, were found to reduce the metabolism of caffeine. However, studies suggest caffeine had no significant effect on the concentration of these medications in blood or brain tissue. The inhibition of caffeine at high doses when used with MAOIs such as tranylcypromine and phenelzine was found to lead to a higher likelihood of experiencing hypertension. Coadministration of caffeine with venlafaxine (SNRIs) suggests minimal interactions between the two substances and the pharmacodynamic effects of venlafaxine were unlikely to be impacted by caffeine consumption. Miscellaneous antidepressants (reboxetine, mianserin, agomelatine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine) displayed varying pharmacodynamic interactions with caffeine, resulting in increased antidepressant effects where vortioxetine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine failed to demonstrate any interactions. In conclusion, caffeine demonstrated varying effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each class of antidepressants, with several classes of antidepressants demonstrating a similar effect on caffeine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both listening to music during warm-up and consuming caffeine before exercise have been independently shown to enhance athletic performance. However, the potential synergistic effects of combining these strategies remain largely unexplored. To date, only two studies have reported additional benefits to combining music during warm-up with a caffeine dose of 3 mg/kg on taekwondo-specific performance tasks. However, these studies did not evaluate whether this combination produces additive or synergistic effects on other types of sports performance. The present study aimed to assess the effects of listening to music alone or combined with caffeine intake on performance in the Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) in physically active subjects. METHODS: Twenty-four physically active male participants took part in this randomized, double-blind, crossover experiment. Participants underwent WAnT performance evaluations under three conditions: (i) no intervention (control; CON); (ii) music plus placebo (Mus + PLA), involving the intake of a placebo (maltodextrin) 60 min prior and self-selected high-tempo music during warm-up; and (iii) music plus caffeine (Mus + CAF), involving the intake of 3 mg/kg of caffeine 60 min prior and self-selected high-tempo music during warm-up. Under all conditions, participants wore the same Bluetooth headphones (with or without music), performed a 10 min standardized warm-up, and completed the 30 s WAnT with a load of 7.5% of their body weight on a calibrated ergometer. Power output was recorded at a frequency of 1 Hz throughout the exercise. The Feeling Scale was assessed both before and after the exercise test, while heart rate (HR) and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured immediately following the exercise. RESULTS: Mus + PLA and Mus + CAF significantly improved peak power, mean power, and total work compared with CON (p < 0.05). Furthermore, peak power was higher in Mus + CAF than in Mus + PLA (p = 0.01). Post-exercise HR and RPE showed no significant differences across conditions (p > 0.05). Regarding the Feeling Scale (FS) before exercise, the Mus + PLA and Mus + CAF conditions showed significantly higher scores than CON (p < 0.05), while no differences were found after exercise. The perceived fitness metrics displayed no significant differences among conditions (p > 0.05), except for self-perceived power, which was higher in Mus + CAF than in CON (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Self-selected music during warm-up, either alone or combined with caffeine, significantly enhanced several WAnT performance metrics, including peak power, mean power, and total work. Remarkably, combining music with caffeine further improved peak power and increased self-perceived power compared with music alone. While listening to self-selected music during warm-up provided measurable benefits on anaerobic exercise performance, the combination of music and caffeine demonstrated additive effects, making it the optimal strategy for maximizing anaerobic performance.",

For this, was used a 23-full factorial design examining three key variables at two levels: electrode height, electrode diameter, and printing speed. Moreover, it evaluates various physical, chemical, and electrochemical methods to treat and activate the E-3D surface. The techniques of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) shows that the sequential physical, chemical, and electrochemical treatments lead to the highest treatment efficiency and activation. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy characterize untreated and treated E-3D sensor surfaces. The optimal treatment and activation methodology was applied to the electroanalysis of paracetamol (PAR) and caffeine (CAF) simultaneously using CV and differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). DPASV measurements reveal limits of detection of 0.44 and 0.58 μmol L-1 in a 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 medium for PAR and CAF, respectively, with the treated and activated E-3D sensor. The principal achievement of this work was emphasizing the critical role of surface treatment and activation in enhancing the performance of the developed electrodes, thereby advancing technological applications of 3D-printed electrochemical sensors."

METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, dispensing clinical trial, 96 children with myopia, aged 6-13 years, spherical equivalent (SE) from -0.50 diopters (D) to -6.00 D and astigmatism less than 2.00 D were randomly assigned to nightly use of either 2 % caffeine, 0.02 % atropine with 2 % caffeine (combination) or 0.02 % atropine eye drops. An additional 86 children with myopia were enrolled in a concurrent parallel group to wear single-vision (SV) spectacles. The primary outcomes were changes in SE and axial length (AL) over a period of 12 months for each group. RESULTS: All groups progressed in myopia. At 12 months, the mean change in SE/AL was -0.76 ± 0.51 D / 0.37 ± 0.20 mm and -0.70 ± 0.55 D / 0.35 ± 0.23 mm with SV and 2 % caffeine, respectively. In comparison, progression was slower at -0.46 ± 0.50 D / 0.24 ± 0.19 mm and -0.47 ± 0.38 D / 0.23 ± 0.18 mm with atropine monotherapy and combination groups, respectively. Compared to the change in AL with SV, the change in AL was significantly less with 0.02 % atropine and the combination group (post hoc analysis, P = 0.024 and 0.007, respectively). Similarly, the change in SE was significantly less with 0.02 % atropine compared to the SV group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Used as a standalone treatment, topical 2 % caffeine did not slow myopia progression. When combined with atropine, caffeine had no impact on the efficacy of atropine in slowing myopia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone deficiencies can disrupt organ functions, significantly impacting the cardiovascular system. Recently, the effects of thyroid hormones on the heart have garnered increased attention. However, most studies are conducted on humans using clinical data, while cellular-level and experimental studies remain limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the cardiovascular implications of hypothyroidism and evaluate the impact of caffeine on cardiac health in rats induced with hypothyroidism using propylthiouracil (PTU). METHODS: The study involved 60 rats divided into six groups. Group 1 served as the untreated control. Group 2 received PTU for two months to induce hypothyroidism. Group 3 received PTU for one month, followed by caffeine for one month. Group 4 received caffeine for two months. Group 5 received both PTU and caffeine simultaneously for two months. Group 6 received PTU for one month, followed by one month under normal conditions. RESULTS: During necropsy, normal thyroid glands were observed in Groups 1, 4, and 6, enlarged thyroids in Group 2, and smaller thyroids in Groups 3 and 5. Microscopic examination revealed varying thyroid histologies: Group 2 showed significant epithelial cell proliferation and absent colloid, while Groups 3, 5, and 6 had altered yet colloid-containing acini. Macroscopic inspection of hearts appeared normal across all groups. However, histopathological examination revealed significant hyperemia and microhemorrhages in Group 2, contrasting with normal findings in other groups. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated reduced cardiac troponin expression in Group 2, while other groups maintained prominent expression. Additionally, Group 2 displayed increased serum TSH levels and decreased T3 and T4 levels. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that administering caffeine alongside or after PTU treatment in rats with experimentally induced hypothyroidism may ameliorate thyroid and cardiac irregularities. This study indicates caffeine's potential in mitigating the adverse effects of hypothyroidism on thyroid and heart health."

We also assessed associations of sample entropy with weeks of gestation, clinical morbidity, AOP frequency and caffeine reinitiation. METHODS: We conducted a prospective single-centre study at the University Children's Hospital Basel, Switzerland, from July 2019 to June 2020. We included 61 hospitalised preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation. Heart rate was derived from the clinical standard monitoring system at caffeine cessation, 3 days later, and at discharge. Sample entropy was calculated from 90-min recordings using custom-written analytical software. RESULTS: We obtained valid data from 44/61 infants (72%) with a mean of 28.4 weeks of gestation (range: 24.0-31.7). Twenty-eight (64%) were male. Sample entropy at caffeine cessation was positively associated with weeks of gestation (R2 = 0.15, p = 0.01) and negatively with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (R2 = 0.18, p = 0.01). It did not predict AOP frequency or caffeine reinitiation. CONCLUSION: Sample entropy at caffeine cessation is associated with maturation at birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia but does not predict AOP within 3 days of cessation. Further studies should assess longitudinal measurements to predict respiratory control in preterm infants. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04303494."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Minimizing the duration of mechanical ventilation is one of the most important therapeutic goals during the care of preterm infants at neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The rate of extubation failure among preterm infants is between 16% and 40% worldwide. Numerous studies have been conducted on the assessment of extubation suitability, the optimal choice of respiratory support around extubation, and the effectiveness of medical interventions. Since the Caffeine Therapy for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP) trial, caffeine has become one of the essential drugs at NICUs. However, the optimal dosage and timing for adequate effectiveness still need to be more conclusive. Previous studies suggest that higher doses of caffeine treatment increase the success rate of extubation. Therefore, we aim to determine whether using a single additional loading dose of caffeine citrate one hour prior to extubation impacts the success rate of extubation. METHODS: The study is an open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial testing the effectiveness and safety of pre-extubational loading dose of caffeine citrate. Inclusion criteria will be infants born before the 32nd gestational week, before the first extubation attempt after at least 48 hours of mechanical ventilation, and a signed parental informed consent. A total of 226 patients will be randomly allocated to either the experimental or control group. The randomization will be stratified by gestational age and antenatal steroid prophylaxis. Preterm infants in the experimental group will receive an additional intravenous (IV) loading dose (20 mg/kg) of caffeine citrate one hour before the first planned extubation, in addition to the standard dosing regimen (20 mg/kg caffeine citrate IV on the first day of life and 5 to 10 mg/kg IV or orally caffeine citrate each consecutive day). Preterm infants in the control group will receive the standard dosing regimen. The primary outcome will be reintubation within 48 hours. DISCUSSION: A pre-extubational loading dose of caffeine citrate can reduce extubation failure. Obtaining evidence on this feature has the potential to contribute to finding the optimal dosing regimen. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study protocol was approved by the Hungarian Ethics Committee for Clinical Pharmacology of the Medical Research Council and National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition (OGYÉI/6838-11/2023).

      "abstract": "Caffeine has recently attracted attention as a potential remedy for hair loss. In the present review, we look into the molecule's possible mechanisms of action and pharmacodynamics. At the molecular level, it appears that the physiological effects of caffeine are mainly due to the molecule's interaction with adenosine pathways which leads to an increase in cAMP level and the stimulation of metabolic activity in the hair follicle. Moreover, caffeine also acts as an antioxidant and may prevent degenerative processes. While the intact stratum corneum seems virtually impenetrable to caffeine and a range of physical and chemical methods have been proposed to facilitate its penetration, hair follicles seem to be both a main entry route into the skin and target structures for caffeine at the same time. Caffeine readily forms bonds with water and other molecules which may influence its bioavailability and should be taken into account when engineering future hair products. The results of clinical studies published so far seem promising; however, the majority of the studies of caffeine-based hair loss products offer a very low level of evidence due to considerable flaws in study designs. Nevertheless, the metabolic activity of caffeine and its ability to enter and accumulate in the hair follicles combined with the results of available clinical trials seem to indicate that caffeine could indeed prove as an effective and safe option in the management of hair loss.",

METHODS: Fifteen healthy older adults performed physical performance regarding daily practice, strength, and balance tests after ingestion of acute 5 mg/kg of caffeine or placebo before and after Pilates training. RESULTS: The caffeine intake reduced, regardless of Pilates training, the time in 10-m walk test (before placebo vs caffeine, 6.48 ± 0.70 vs 6.51 ± 0.82 seconds; after placebo vs caffeine, 5.84 ± 0.70 vs 5.48 ± 0.61 seconds; P = .008; ηp 2 = 0.404) and timed up and go test (before placebo vs caffeine, 26.30 ± 1.82 vs 24.37 ± 2.12 seconds; after placebo vs caffeine, 22.96 ± 2.36 vs 22.49 ± 2.27 seconds; P = .002; ηp 2 = 0.517) compared with the placebo. Participants were not less responsive to caffeine intake in the 10-m walk test (ΔPre vs ΔPost, -0.33 ± 0.66 vs -0.36 ± 0.53 seconds; P = .888), but they were less responsive for the timed up and go test (ΔPre vs ΔPost, -1.92 ± 2.06 vs -0.47 ± 1.15 seconds; P = 0.030) after Pilates intervention. There were no differences for the sit-to-stand test, rising from the floor, dress and undress T-shirt, handgrip strength, and balance variables. CONCLUSION: Although the caffeine improved on the 10-m walk test and timed up and go test performance, healthy older adults were less responsive to caffeine after Pilates training only for performance on the timed up and go test."

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that nicotine and caffeine significantly alter biological processes related to synaptic function, and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes in the nicotine-treated group were significantly more enriched in pathways related to substance dependence, with arecoline showing the least enrichment. Furthermore, only acute caffeine treatment significantly increased mouse activity, and only nicotine induced CPP.

Caffeine exerts anti-inflammatory effects and has been used in neonatal intensive care units in recent decades. In our neonatal rat model of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury, we demonstrated that a single daily dose of caffeine (40 mg/kg) for 3 days post-HI reduced brain tissue loss and microgliosis compared to the vehicle group. The AMPK/mTOR pathway plays an important role in sensing the stress responses following brain injury. However, the role of mTOR in HI-associated brain damage remains unclear. A detailed analysis of the AMPK/mTOR pathway in our model revealed that this pathway plays a key role in hypoxia-regulated neuroprotection and can be significantly influenced by caffeine treatment. Targeting HI with caffeine might offer effective neuroprotection, reduce mortality, and improve functional outcomes in patients with HIE, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where neuroprotective treatment is urgently needed.",

This study aims to induce callus from leaf explants of Todolo arabica coffee and improve the levels of caffeine compounds in Todolo coffee with the additional precursor L-methionine as elicitor. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; This research was conducted at the Tissue Culture Laboratory, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Hasanuddin University. This experimental study used a Complete Randomized Design (CRD) approach. The five stages involved callus induction, elicitation with L-methionine precursor, caffeine extraction, qualitative testing using the Parry Method and quantitative analysis via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Tools and materials were sterilized using autoclaving and media preparation followed standard procedures with varying L-methionine concentrations. Callus induction from sterilized leaf explants was done under aseptic conditions, followed by L-methionine treatment and caffeine content extraction. Caffeine was analyzed using UV-Vis spectrophotometry at 272 nm and statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA and DMRT at a 5% significance level. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The friable callus structure has a shiny and wavy appearance and is more easily detached, which is highly correlated with the speed of callus growth. The callus on the treatment medium is slightly yellowish-white to somewhat brownish, indicating the production of secondary metabolites. The best concentration of L-methionine treatment was 25 mg/L with a percentage of caffeine content of 0.0078%. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Results concluded that the addition of L-methionine has a significant effect on the percentage of caffeine production.",

Young women (means ± SD; 24 ± 7 yr) were randomized to a caffeine (120 mg) supplement (CAF; n = 17) or placebo (PLA; n = 16) group, completed 6 wk of high-intensity exercise training on three nonconsecutive days per week, and supplemented with CAF or PLA 30-60 min before exercise or else upon waking. Before (PRE) and after (POST) the intervention, SBP, DBP, and HR were measured and PP and DP were calculated, at rest and during fixed-power exercise at 50 and 75 W. Statistical analyses included three-way mixed-factorial ANOVAs with post hoc comparisons as necessary. Group × intensity × time interactions were observed for SBP (P = 0.0105) and DP (P = 0.003). SBP and DP increased with increasing exercise intensity at PRE and POST in both groups. However, although SBP and DP decreased PRE to POST at 50 and 75 W in PLA, SBP and DP did not change at any intensity from PRE to POST in CAF. An intensity × time interaction was observed for DBP (P = 0.006) indicating no change in resting DBP, but reductions from PRE to POST at 50 and 75 W that were independent of group. Main effects of intensity (P < 0.0001) and time (P = 0.03) were observed for HR, and a main effect of intensity was observed for PP (P < 0.0001). Habitual caffeine supplementation blunted training-induced reductions in exercising SBP and DP. Individuals may wish to avoid preexercise supplementation if seeking to maximize the BP-lowering benefits of exercise.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Habitual preexercise caffeine consumption prevented reductions in exercising systolic blood pressure and double product induced by 6 wk of high-intensity exercise in women. Therefore, our findings indicate that habitual preexercise caffeine supplementation may impede beneficial hemodynamic adaptations of exercise training in healthy, young women.",

It is also often used as an active substance in over-the-counter drugs such as painkillers and preparations for the treatment of colds and allergies. While caffeine is generally considered safe when moderately consumed, excessive intake in a single dose or through repeated small doses over time can lead to caffeine intoxication. Symptoms of caffeine intoxication can vary depending on the amount of caffeine consumed and can include restlessness, rapid heart rate, muscle tremors, nausea, vomiting, and confusion. In severe cases, caffeine intoxication can lead to convulsions, coma, and even death. This mini-review presents an overview of caffeine's characteristics and intoxication including symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment. It addresses risk factors associated with caffeine intoxication and presents current recommendations for safe caffeine consumption.

This study evaluates caffeine-encapsulated titanium oxide nanoparticles (CF-TiO2 NPs) for their potential to prevent biofilm formation on teeth and enhance oral anticancer treatment by influencing apoptotic gene regulation. The synthesized CF-TiO2 NPs were characterized using ultraviolet, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, and their antioxidant activity was confirmed through free radical quenching studies. Antimicrobial efficacy was assessed using a zone of inhibition test, revealing strong activity against dental pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 80 µg/mL. Molecular docking using AutoDock explored interactions between CF and biofilm target sites, supporting their inhibitory potential. In vitro cytotoxicity studies on KB cancer cells showed a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxic effects, with CF-TiO2 NPs promoting apoptotic gene upregulation at concentrations of 20-160 µg/mL. CF-TiO2 NPs demonstrated excellent antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticancer properties, showcasing their promise for oral therapeutic applications. This research highlights a novel approach to managing oral infections and associated complications while improving systemic oral health. Notably, this study is the first to report the biofilm-inhibitory and anticancer potential of CF-TiO2 NPs."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Inflammation and apoptosis contribute to the development of dry eye disease (DED) and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). This study aimed to investigate the effect of caffeine on the ocular surface and tear inflammatory cytokines through clinical, in vivo, and in vitro experiments. METHODS: In the clinical study, comprehensive ophthalmic examinations of participants in the control and the caffeine groups were compared, including ocular surface and tears inflammatory cytokines. For in vitro study, rat meibomian gland epithelial cells (RMGECs) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were pretreated with or without caffeine and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and differentiation in cells were analyzed. In vivo study, apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice were given caffeine-diet or no caffeine-diet, and their meibomian glands (MGs) and corneal tissue were compared. RESULTS: Participants in the caffeine group exhibited significantly healthier ocular surface, lower tears inflammatory cytokines and a reduced prevalence of DED compared to the control group. In vitro study, caffeine pretreatment attenuated inflammatory responses, apoptosis and differentiation in LPS-induced RMGECs. Meanwhile, caffeine also markedly suppressed inflammatory responses and apoptosis in LPS-induced HCECs. In vivo study showed that ApoE-/- mice with caffeine-diet had more normal morphology of MGs and corneas compared to those without caffeine-diet, along with reduced inflammatory responses, cells apoptosis and ductal keratinization. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that caffeine treatment was observed to inactivate of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that caffeine may be a protective potential of ocular surface, providing a new perspective on clinical treatment for DED and MGD.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Caffeine is the registered pharmacologic treatment for apnea of prematurity and is extensively used in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) based on evidence from randomized controlled trials. This study aimed to describe the clinical use of caffeine based on real-world data, hypothesizing a divergence from the registered dosing regimen. METHODS: A retrospective analysis included infants born before 30 weeks of gestation, admitted to the NICU of the Erasmus MC Rotterdam from 2018 to 2021. Exclusion criteria comprised infants admitted after postnatal day 2, those not receiving caffeine during admission, patients admitted for less than 24 h, those who spent less than 24 h on non-invasive support, and cases lacking medication data. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving an average caffeine dose higher than registered on the label. RESULTS: A total of 451 patients with a median gestational age of 28+0 weeks (IQR 26+2-29+0) and birthweight of 1,015 g (IQR 800-1,218) were included. Of these, 402 infants (89%) received an average daily caffeine dosage exceeding the registered dose range. The median caffeine maintenance dose per patient was 5.3 mg/kg/day (IQR 5.0-5.8), with additional therapy (mini-load, doxapram, or intubation) needed in 318 patients (71%). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the frequent use of higher caffeine dosages in clinical practice than registered and recommended based on long-term safety data. Despite these high dosages and frequent mini-loads, 28% of patients still required additional treatment with doxapram and/or invasive mechanical ventilation, indicating the need for individualized dosing strategies or alternative therapies."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Chronic hypobaric hypoxia frequently results in memory deficits, with severe cases showing marked alterations in dopamine levels and its metabolites. This research explores caffeine's modulation of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) and its regulatory effects on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aiming to restore dopamine homeostasis and mitigate memory impairments associated with hypoxia. The goal is to identify novel preventive strategies against cognitive decline induced by hypoxia. METHODS: Network pharmacological analysis was employed to predict the interactions between caffeine, cognitive function, and hypobaric hypoxia-related disorders. The novel object recognition and Y-maze tests were utilized to assess caffeine's impact on memory deficits under hypobaric hypoxia conditions in male mice. LC-MS/MS analysis was subsequently conducted to examine the variations in dopamine and its metabolites within the midbrain. Molecular docking further confirmed the binding affinities between A2AR and caffeine, as well as TH and caffeine. Additionally, immunofluorescence and protein-protein docking were employed to elucidate the interaction between A2AR and TH. RESULTS: The findings highlight the pivotal role of adenosine receptors and dopamine-related pathways in the interplay between caffeine, cognition, and hypobaric hypoxia-related disorders. Behavioral tests demonstrated that caffeine effectively alleviated memory impairments caused by chronic hypobaric hypoxia. LC-MS/MS results revealed significant differences in dopamine, metanephrine, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid levels following caffeine treatment for hypoxia-induced cognitive deficits. Molecular docking confirmed the high affinity between A2AR and caffeine, as well as TH and caffeine, while immunofluorescence and protein-protein docking provided insights into the A2AR-TH interaction and its modulation during hypobaric hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine exhibits potent neuroprotective effects against chronic high-altitude-induced cognitive impairments, potentially through its action on A2AR, leading to enhanced TH expression and subsequent release of dopamine and its related neurotransmitters.",

      "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is caused by the impact of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on hair follicles, leading to progressive hair loss in men and women. In this study, we developed caffeine-loaded hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles coated with ultradeformable liposomes (ULp-Caf@HMSNs) to enhance caffeine delivery to hair follicles. Caffeine, known to inhibit DHT formation, faces challenges in skin penetration due to its hydrophilic nature. We investigated caffeine encapsulated in liposomes, hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs), and ultradeformable liposome-coated HMSNs to optimize drug delivery and release. For ultradeformable liposomes (ULs), the amount of polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80 was varied. TEM images confirmed the mesoporous shell and hollow core structure of HMSNs, with a shell thickness of 25-35 nm and a hollow space of 80-100 nm. SEM and TEM analysis showed particle sizes ranging from 140-160 nm. Thermal stability tests showed that HMSNs coated with ULs exhibited a Td10 value of 325 °C and 70% residue ash, indicating good thermal stability. Caffeine release experiments indicated that the highest release occurred in caffeine-loaded HMSNs without a liposome coating. In contrast, systems incorporating ULp-Caf@HMSNs exhibited slower release rates, attributable to the dual encapsulation mechanism. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that ULs-coated particles penetrated deeper into the skin than non-liposome particles. MTT assays confirmed the non-cytotoxicity of all HMSN concentrations to human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs). ULp-Caf@HMSNs promoted better cell viability than pure caffeine or caffeine-loaded HMSNs, highlighting enhanced biocompatibility without increased toxicity. Additionally, ULp-Caf@HMSNs effectively reduced ROS levels in DHT-damaged HFDPCs, suggesting they are promising alternatives to minoxidil for promoting hair follicle growth and reducing hair loss without increasing oxidative stress. This system shows promise for treating AGA.",

      "abstract": "The effect of caffeine on the behavior and sleep patterns of zebrafish larvae, as well as its underlying mechanisms, has been a topic of great interest. This study aimed to investigate the impact of caffeine on zebrafish larval sleep/wake behavior and the expression of key regulatory genes such as cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and adenosine (ADA) in the sleep pathway. To begin, the study determined the optimal dose and duration of caffeine exposure, with the optimal doses found to be 31.25 μM, 62.5 μM, and 120 μM. Similarly, the optimal exposure time was established as no more than 120 h, ensuring a mortality rate of less than 10%. The confirmation of these conditions was achieved through the assessment of angiogenesis and the inflammatory reaction. As a result, the treatment time point of 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) was selected to examine the effects of caffeine on zebrafish larval sleep rhythm (48 h, with a light cycle of 14:10). Furthermore, the study analyzed the expression of clock genes (bmal1a, per1b, per2, per3, cry2), adenosine receptor genes (adora1a, adora1b, adora2aa, adora2ab, adora2b), and key regulatory factors (CREB and ADA). The research confirmed that caffeine could induce sleep pattern disorders, significantly upregulate adenosine receptor genes (adora1a, adora1b, adora2a, adora2ab, adora2b) (p < 0.05), and markedly decrease the total sleep time and sleep efficiency of the larvae. Additionally, the activity of ADA significantly increased during the exposure (p < 0.001), and the tissue-specific expression of CREB was also significantly increased, as assessed by immunofluorescence. Caffeine may regulate circadian clock genes through the ADA/ADORA/CREB pathway. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the effects of caffeine on zebrafish larvae but also provide valuable insights into the potential impact of caffeine on human behavior and sleep."

Caffeine and its derivatives have been studied for their neuroprotective and antidepressant effect. Current study aimed to explore the potential antidepressant effect of a caffeine derivative, Sy-2476 [4-(1, 3, 7-trimethyl-2, 6-dioxo-2, 3, 6, 7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-8-yl) benzo nitrile], in corticosterone-induced rat model of depression. Depression-like behaviour in rats was induced by administering 20 mg/kg hydrocortisone s.c for 21 days. Behavioural studies evaluated the potential antidepressant effect of caffeine derivative Sy-2476, its effect on cortisol levels, modulation of A1/A2A receptors mRNA expression and antioxidant assays. Treatment of rats with Sy-2476 exhibited robust antidepressant-like effects in corticosterone-exposed rats by increasing sucrose preference (p = 0.0002) while reducing immobility time (p = 0.0118) in the forced swim test. Sy-2476 also reduced lipid peroxidation and increased the level of antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, Sy-2476 significantly lowered cortisol levels (p = 0.0019) and up-regulated mRNA expression of A1 (p = 0.0001) and A2A receptors (p = 0.0016) compared to the corticosterone-only treated group. In conclusion, Sy-2476 showed an antidepressant effect primarily by suppressing serum cortisol levels, modulating the expression of adenosine receptors, and exhibiting antioxidant properties.",

      "abstract": "Ex vivo penetration tests are important tools in cosmetic and pharmaceutical research. However, variability of experimental setups is challenging when reviewing literature. Different skin models, pre-treatments and experimental parameters render comparison difficult. Thus, our aim was to conduct ex vivo penetration tests using caffeine in different setups with varying incubation conditions (ambient vs. Franz cells, infinite vs. finite dose). Additionally, the impact of skin pre-treatment with different aggressors (surfactants, UVA irradiation) should be considered. Possible synergistic barrier damage of surfactants and UVA irradiation should be explored. Analysis was conducted using quantitative confocal Raman spectroscopy. Results showed that incubation time and extensive hydration (20 h in Franz cells) had the greatest impact on penetration behavior. Additional irradiation after pre-treatment with oil-in-water nanoemulsions showed no strong impact on caffeine penetration in general, irrespective of surfactant type. However, in case of sodium lauryl ether sulfate, a trend towards enhanced values was observed due to irradiation (1.3-fold). This suggests cumulative skin barrier damage of irritant surfactants and UVA irradiation, potentially due to stratum corneum alterations. Further studies using different irradiation regimens are planned to confirm this hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive drug globally, has been associated with vascular changes in various organs, including the retina. Researchers have reported vascular constriction in the retina in response to caffeine, although data on its effects remain limited and somewhat contradictory. Further research is needed to clarify the specific impact of caffeine on retinal blood vessels and its potential implications for ocular health. Purpose: To investigate the effects of 200 mg of caffeine on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and retinal vessel density (VD) assessed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods: Prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, IRB-approved study in 59 healthy low caffeine users (< 136 mg of caffeine daily). Baseline 3 × 3 and 6 × 6 mm OCTA scans centered on the fovea as well as a 6 × 6 mm scans centered on the optic nerve head (ONH) were obtained. Participants were randomly assigned into caffeine group (CG, n = 42) receiving 200 mg caffeine pill or placebo group (PG, n = 17). OCTA scans were repeated at 60 and 120 min after intervention. VD was measured with Advanced Retina Imaging (ARI) network software (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) for superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP). SBP/DBP readings were recorded before each imaging session. Ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of each group was performed using GraphPad Prism Version 9.3.0. Results: Both groups had comparable demographics and OCTA parameters at baseline. Two hours after intervention, the CG had a significantly higher SBP (123 ± 7 mmHg) and DBP (81 ± 5 mmHg) compared to the control group (118 ± 7 mmHg, 77 ± 6 mmHg) (p value = 0.012, 0.023). Regarding the OCTA VD metrics, there were no significant differences in VD between the caffeine and placebo groups, regardless of whether the scans were centered on the macula or ONH. Additionally, the comparison across different OCTA scan modalities, specifically the 3 × 3 mm and 6 × 6 mm scans, showed no discernible differences among groups. Conclusion: In conclusion, 200 mg of caffeine elevated blood pressure after 2 h but did not impact the retinal VD. This underscores the intricate relationship between caffeine, blood pressure, and retinal vascular dynamics, prompting further exploration of their implications for ocular health, especially in subjects with vascular disease."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of different concentrations of CAF-MR on selective attention in relation to perceived taste intensity. METHODS: A total of 30 healthy and recreationally active male subjects were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Interventions included MR for 20 s at rest with three different caffeine solutions (0.24% [60 mg/25 mL], 0.6% [150 mg/25 mL], and 1.2% [300 mg/25 mL]), MR with 25 mL water (placebo), and no MR (control). Data on Victoria Stroop Test (VST) and the perceived taste intensity were recorded at five sessions. RESULTS: CAF-MR-300 mg intervention significantly decreased completion time (from 62.93 ± 19.07 to 57.01 ± 16.74 s, p = 0.002 in Part D), while CAF-MR-150 mg intervention significantly decreased number of errors in Part D (7.00 ± 6.21 vs. 5.63 ± 5.76, p = 0.04) and Part C (8.77 ± 8.80 vs. 7.10 ± 7.11, p = 0.02). Perceived difficulty was significantly decreased both after CAF-MR with 150 mg (5.57 ± 1.65 vs. 4.77 ± 1.98, p = 0.006) and 300 mg (5.95 ± 1.77vs. 4.67 ± 1.96, p < 0.001). Perceived taste intensity for 300 mg of caffeine was negatively correlated with completion time (r: ranged, 0.37 to 0.46, p ranged, 0.045 to 0.009) after 300 mg, 150 mg (p ranged, 0.04 to 0.005) and placebo (p ranged 0.044 to 0.03) interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate that CAF-MR shows dose-dependent effects on selective attention in healthy recreational males, such as improved speed (for 300 mg caffeine), reduced error rate (for 150 mg caffeine) and decrease in perceived difficulty (for 150 and 300 mg caffeine).",

After extracting of the analyte, it was eluted using the mobile phase. The analyte was then analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection, limit of quantification, and linear range of the calibration curve were found to be 1.7, 5.9, and 10-500 µg/L, respectively. To assess the precision of the method, five replicates of standard solutions containing caffeine at two different concentration levels (50 and 100 µg/L) were tested. The relative standard deviations for intra- and inter-day precisions ranged from 4.3 to 6.8 %. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by analyzing the samples obtained from premature infants undergoing caffeine treatment and caffeine concentrations were 4.9 ± 0.6, 2.7 ± 0.2 µg/L in the EBC samples of who were under treatment by a 5-mg dose. Also, caffeine concentrations were 5.9 ± 0.3 and 18 ± 0.6 µg/L in the the infants who obtained the 10-mg and 25-mg doses, respectively. The results indicated a satisfactory, extraction recovery of 86 % showcasing the method's reliability and effectiveness in analyzing real samples.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the potential influence of adenosine and dopamine receptor genes polymorphisms in combination with clinical factors on the response of preterm infants to caffeine citrate treatment in apnea of prematurity (AOP). METHODS: A prospective nested case-control study enrolled 221 preterm infants with gestational age < 34 weeks. These infants were divided into the response (n = 160) and the non-response groups (n = 61). 22 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in adenosine and dopamine receptor genes were genotyped. The basic characteristics and clinical outcomes of the two groups were compared. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the differences in genotype distribution between the groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk and protective factors and develop a nomogram to predict caffeine citrate response in preterm infants. RESULTS: Preterm infants in the non-response group had lower gestational age, lower birth weight, longer periods of oxygen supplementation and caffeine citrate use, and higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and brain injury (P < 0.05 for all). The ADORA1 rs10920573, ADORA2B rs2015353, ADORA3 rs10776728, DRD3 rs7625282, and DRD3 rs6280 gene polymorphisms were associated with caffeine citrate response in preterm infants (PFDR < 0.05 for all). The ADORA1 rs10920573 CC (aOR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.34-9.25) and DRD3 rs6280 CT genotypes (aOR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.53-6.65) were independent risk factors for non-response, whereas greater gestational age (aOR, 0.631; 95% CI, 0.53-0.75) was an independent protective factor for response. The concordance index of the nomogram was 0.764 (95% CI, 0.687-0.842), and the calibration and decision curve analysis indicated the nomogram had excellent predict performance. CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine receptor gene and dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms influence caffeine citrate treatment response in AOP. By combining genetic and clinical variables, it is possible to predict the response to caffeine citrate treatment in preterm infants.",

Eighty-five middle-aged women were randomized into 4 groups including control, Zumba training (ZT), caffeine supplementation (Ca) or caffeine-Zumba training (Ca + ZT) groups. Functional performances were assessed using 10 m Walk, Timed Up and Go, Functional Reach, and 30-Second Chair Stand tests. As results, ZT, Ca and Ca + ZT intervention programs showed a significant (p < 0.05) functional performances improvement. However, Ca + ZT group showed significant (p < 0.001) better scores in terms of mobility (95%CI [0.71, 1.43]), gait speed (95%CI [0.52, 1.71]) and lower body endurance strength (95%CI [-6.93, -1.92]), except for dynamic balance (95%CI [-9.41, -3.44]). In conclusion, 12-week of Zumba training improves functional performances in middle-aged women, and daily caffeine intake is an effective alternative for improving such performances. Supplementing caffeine (100 mg/day) to Zumba training was effective in boosting Zumba benefits on these functional performances.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine, commonly found in coffee and tea, affects various aspects of eye health as it blocks adenosine receptors, impacting tear production, intraocular pressure, macular perfusion, and choroidal thickness. However, its connection with eye conditions like glaucoma and cataracts remains uncertain due to conflicting research findings. Some studies suggest potential benefits for cataracts, while others warn against frequent caffeine intake in glaucoma and surgical scenarios due to possible increases in intraocular pressure. Conflicting evidence also exists regarding its effects on dry eye, macular degeneration, myopia/hyperopia, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and central serous retinopathy. Caffeine does not seem to be a risk factor for dry eye, although studies have shown that caffeine may offer protection against wet age-related macular degeneration, and the metabolite 7-methylxanthine could be a more promising treatment for myopia. Moreover, caffeine can potentially cause tremors and might hinder surgical performance, especially in less experienced surgeons. Recommendations from experts vary, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand how caffeine affects the eye. Individuals genetically predisposed to glaucoma should be cautious due to the possibility of clinically significant elevations in intraocular pressure with caffeine consumption. For delicate procedures like microsurgery, where tremors can be detrimental, caution should be exercised with caffeine. This review underscores the importance of additional studies to provide clearer insights and prudent recommendations regarding caffeine's impact on eye health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a well-known psychostimulant reputed to alleviate the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation. Nevertheless, caffeine can alter sleep duration and quality, particularly during recovery sleep. We evaluated the effects of acute caffeine intake on the duration and quality of recovery sleep following total sleep deprivation (TSD), taking into account daily caffeine consumption. METHODS: Forty-one participants performed a double-blind, crossover TSD protocol (38 h of continuous wakefulness) with acute caffeine or placebo. Caffeine (2.5 mg/kg) or placebo was administered twice during continuous wakefulness (last treatment 6.5 h before bedtime for the recovery night). Polysomnographic measurements were recorded using a connected headband. RESULTS: TSD was associated with a rebound in total sleep time (TST) on the recovery night (+110.2 ± 23.2 min, p < 0.001). Caffeine intake decreased this recovery TST (-30.2 ± 8.2 min p = 0.02) and the N3 sleep stage duration (-35.6 ± 23.2 min, p < 0.01). Caffeine intake altered recovery sleep continuity (increased number of long awakenings), stability (higher stage transition frequency), and organization (less time spent in complete sleep cycle) and decreased the delta power spectral density during NREM sleep. On the recovery night, habitual daily caffeine consumption was negatively correlated with TST in caffeine and placebo conditions and positively correlated with wake after sleep onset (WASO) duration and with the frequency of long (>2 min) awakenings in the caffeine condition only. CONCLUSIONS: Acute caffeine intake during TSD affects nighttime recovery sleep, with an interaction with daily consumption. These results may influence advice on caffeine intake for night-shift workers. (NCT03859882).",

The current-voltage characteristics and the plasma parameters of the CDBD, such as the electron temperature, electron density, density of nitrogen excited states, vibrational temperature, and rotational temperature, were assessed through electrical and optical characterization respectively. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to evaluate the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in the plasma-treated air. The physicochemical properties of deionized water (DW) were measured. To gain a deeper insight into the role of RONS in caffeine degradation, their concentrations in DW were analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of initial concentration, sample volume, and pH on caffeine degradation were investigated. The highest degradation of caffeine was 94% at initial concentration of 50 mg L-1, sample volume 50 mL and in neutral pH. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was then used to propose the degradation pathway for caffeine. The major reactive species involved in caffeine degradation was ozone. Finally, the phytotoxicity and cytotoxicity of caffeine were assessed before and after plasma treatment with plasma-treated caffeine (PTC) showing minimal toxicity to both plants and cells.",

      "abstract": "Surface waters within the basin of the Laurentian Great Lakes are impacted by microbial contamination from municipal wastewater and agricultural runoff, as well as from other sources. In particular, microbial contamination of drinking water is an ongoing problem within many Indigenous communities located in the basin. However, it is difficult to identify the sources of microbial contamination using the traditional monitoring approaches with fecal indicator bacteria, such as total coliforms and Escherichia coli (E. coli). In this study, we evaluated whether surface waters in the basin are contaminated with fecal bacteria of human origin using chemical indicators of domestic wastewater (i.e., caffeine and sucralose) and with Bacteroidales 16S rRNA markers. Study areas included the Grand River watershed within the Lake Erie basin and three nearshore locations within the Great Lakes basin. Two of these sites are sources of drinking water for Indigenous communities. We assessed whether there were relationships between the concentrations of fecal indicator microorganisms and chemical indicators of domestic wastewater at selected study locations. Analysis of genetic markers indicated that about 30% of the Bacteroidales bacteria present at a site in the Grand River were of human fecal origin and the balance were of bovine or general animal origin. The presence of caffeine and sucralose in surface waters indicated that there was upstream contamination by domestic wastewater. However, in the drinking water treatment plant operated by Six Nations of the Grand River, the levels of these chemical indicators and fecal bacteria were reduced by the advanced water treatment technologies. The concentrations of sucralose and caffeine collectively were strongly correlated with the levels of total coliforms in samples from the Grand River (R2 = 0.75) and with levels of E. coli in samples from the Great Lakes basin (R2 = 0.97), but there appeared to be an upper threshold for this relationship. These data indicate that analysis of caffeine and sucralose and genetic markers for strains of Bacteroidales fecal bacteria may be useful tools for identifying the sources of microbiological contamination of surface waters and drinking water.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries, where ≈96% of affected infants reside. The current standard of care, therapeutic hypothermia, is frequently ineffective in this setting, likely because injury may be occurring earlier during labor. Here, we studied the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of perinatal caffeine administration in near-term lambs following global ischemic injury to support the development of earlier treatment strategies targeting the fetus in utero as well as the infant postnatally. METHODS: Ewes were randomly assigned to receive either 1 g IV caffeine citrate or placebo before delivery and placental transport assessed. Near-term lambs (141-143 days) of both sexes were subjected to severe global hypoxia-ischemia utilizing an acute umbilical cord occlusion model. Lambs that received caffeine in utero also received 20 mg/kg IV caffeine citrate following resuscitation and 10 mg/(kg·d) IV for 2 days. An additional cohort received 60 mg/kg followed by 30 mg/(kg·d) (low dose versus high dose) postnatally. Biochemical, histological, and neurological outcome measures in lambs were assessed over a 6-day period. RESULTS: Perinatal caffeine administration demonstrated excellent placental transport kinetics and was well tolerated with lamb plasma levels comparable to those targeted in neonates with apnea of prematurity. Caffeine administration resulted in a systemic immunomodulatory effect, evidenced by significant reductions in proinflammatory IP-10 levels. Treated lambs demonstrated improved neurodevelopmental outcomes, while histological analysis revealed that caffeine reduced gray matter injury and attenuated inflammation in the cingulate and parasagittal cortex. This neuroprotective effect was greater and via a different mode of action than we previously reported for azithromycin. A higher caffeine dosing regimen demonstrated significant toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal caffeine administration is well tolerated, attenuates systemic and brain inflammation, and contributes to improvements in histological and neurological outcomes in an ovine model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to delineate the salivary metabolomic profile of patients with idiopathic xerostomia using untargeted metabolomics techniques, with the goal of addressing the lack of clear diagnostic markers and providing insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of the condition. DESIGN: In this observational, cross-sectional study, saliva samples from 33 patients with idiopathic xerostomia and 34 healthy controls were analyzed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS). Metabolomic profiling was complemented by multivariate statistical analysis to differentiate between affected individuals and controls. RESULTS: Metabolomic analysis delineated a pronounced differentiation between patients with idiopathic xerostomia and healthy controls. A total of 195 metabolites displayed significant differential expression, each with a variable importance in projection (VIP) greater than 1 and a P-value less than 0.05. Pathway enrichment analysis, according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), identified 22 metabolites that participated in 18 distinct metabolic pathways. Among these, the caffeine metabolism pathway, characterized by notable alterations in impact values (VIP, P-value, Log2-fold change, Rich factor), emerged as the most significantly disrupted, underscoring its potential role in the pathophysiology of idiopathic xerostomia (P = 0.0000395). CONCLUSIONS: The salivary metabolomic profiling revealed distinct alterations in idiopathic xerostomia, with a significant reduction in caffeine metabolism pathways, underscoring potential neuropathic involvement. This study advances our understanding of the metabolic alterations in xerostomia, suggesting that salivary metabolomics may offer viable biomarkers for diagnosing and understanding the etiology of idiopathic xerostomia. Future research should focus on therapeutic targeting of these metabolic disturbances and evaluating their reversibility with treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cellulite (CLT) is one of the commonly known lipodystrophy syndromes affecting post-adolescent women worldwide. It is topographically characterized by an orange-peel, dimpled skin appearance hence, it is an unacceptable cosmetic problem. CLT can be modulated by surgical procedures such as; liposuction and mesotherapy. But, these options are invasive, expensive and risky. For these reasons, topical CLT treatments are more preferred. Caffeine (CA), is a natural alkaloid that is well-known for its prominent anti-cellulite effects. However, its hydrophilicity hinders its cutaneous permeation. Therefore, in the present study CA was loaded into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) by high shear homogenization/ultrasonication. CA-SLNs were prepared using Compritol® 888 ATO and stearic acid as solid lipids, and span 60 and brij™35, as lipid dispersion stabilizing agents. Formulation variables were adjusted to obtain entrapment efficiency (EE > 75%), particle size (PS < 350 nm), zeta potential (ZP < -25 mV) and polydispersity index (PDI < 0.5). CA-SLN-4 was selected and showed maximized EE (92.03 ± 0.16%), minimized PS (232.7 ± 1.90 nm), and optimum ZP (-25.15 ± 0.65 mV) and PDI values (0.24 ± 0.02). CA-SLN-4 showed superior CA release (99.44 ± 0.36%) compared to the rest CA-SLNs at 1 h. TEM analysis showed spherical, nanosized CA-SLN-4 vesicles. Con-LSM analysis showed successful CA-SLN-4 permeation transepidermally and via shunt diffusion. CA-SLN-4 incorporated into Noveon AA-1® hydrogel (CA-SLN-Ngel) showed accepted physical/rheological properties, and in vitro release profile. Histological studies showed that CA-SLN-Ngel significantly reduced mean subcutaneous fat tissue (SFT) thickness with 4.66 fold (p = 0.035) and 4.16 fold (p = 0.0001) compared to CA-gel, at 7th and 21st days, respectively. Also, significant mean SFT thickness reduction was observed compared to untreated group with 4.83 fold (p = 0.0005) and 3.83 fold (p = 0.0043), at 7th and 21st days, respectively. This study opened new avenue for CA skin delivery via advocating the importance of skin appendages. Hence, CA-SLN-Ngel could be a promising nanocosmeceutical gel for effective CLT treatment.",

METHODS: We enrolled SLE patients without traditional cardiovascular risks factors. Caffeine intake was evaluated with a 7-day food frequency questionnaire. EPCs percentage was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and, subsequently, EPCs pooled from six HD were co-cultured with caffeine with and without SLE sera. After 7 days, we evaluated cells' morphology and ability to form colonies, the percentage of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry analysis and the levels of autophagy and apoptotic markers by western blot. Finally, we performed a western blot analysis to assess the A2AR/SIRT3/AMPK pathway. RESULTS: We enrolled 31 SLE patients, and observed a positive correlation between caffeine intake and circulating EPCs percentage. HD EPCs treated with SLE sera and caffeine showed an improvement in morphology and in number of EPCs colony-forming units in comparison with those incubated without caffeine. Caffeine was able to restore autophagy and apoptotic markers in HD EPCs as before SLE sera treatment. Finally, caffeine treatment was able to significantly reduce A2AR levels, leading to an increase in protein levels of SIRT3 and subsequently AMPK phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine intake positively correlated with the percentage of circulating EPCs in SLE patients; moreover, caffeine in vitro treatment was able to improve EPC survival and vitality through the inhibition of apoptosis and the promotion of autophagy via A2AR/SIRT3/AMPK pathway.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of acetaminophen and caffeine in preventing PDPH. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 96 obstetric women, who were candidates for elective cesarean section. Following the randomization of participants into two groups, participants in the intervention group received tablets of acetaminophen (500 mg)+caffeine (65 mg), and participants in the control group received placebo tablets orally 2 hours before spinal anesthesia induction and then every 6 hours after surgery up to 24 hours. All parturients were evaluated for frequency and intensity of PDPH every 6 hours until 24 hours after surgery and then 48 and 72 hours after surgery. Overall satisfaction during the first 72 hours of postpartum was evaluated. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group were 70% less likely to experience PDPH after spinal anesthesia (OR=0.31 P=0.01, 95% CI [0.12-0.77]). They also experienced significantly milder headaches 18 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours later. Participants in the intervention group reported higher levels of satisfaction at the end of the study (P=0.01). No side effects related to the intervention were reported. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic administration of acetaminophen+caffeine decreases 70% the risk of PDPH and significantly attenuates pain intensity in obstetric patients who underwent spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine (CFF) is efficiently absorbed after ingestion, and approximately 80% of ingested CFF is metabolized to paraxanthine (PXT). Although PXT has approximately twice the adenosine receptor antagonist activity of CFF, there are few reports measuring the metabolite concentrations during CFF intoxication. Furthermore, no studies have examined the efficacy of hemodialysis (HD) on PXT or the indicators that contribute to treatment strategies for patients with acute CFF intoxication. This study analyzed the association between CFF and PXT blood levels, the blood biochemical data, and the vital signs of 27 cases with information on CFF intake and elapsed time data. It was found that HD was not as effective as CFF against PXT in CFF intoxication; however, HD was effective in cases with relatively high PXT concentrations (>10 μg/mL). Simultaneous analysis of CFF and PXT would make it possible to estimate the time elapsed from CFF intake and the risk of hyperCKemia, which may develop in cases left untreated for a prolonged period after ingestion. Therefore, the measurement of PXT, in addition to CFF, is expected to provide useful information for understanding the pathogenesis of CFF intoxication and the development of treatment strategies of acute CFF intoxication.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Tamoxifen, a widely used drug for breast cancer treatment, is associated with adverse effects on the liver, including the development of fatty liver. This study aimed to investigate the potential protective effect of caffeine against tamoxifen-induced fatty liver in Wistar rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into normal control, tamoxifen + saline, and tamoxifen + caffeine. Plasma samples were assessed for biochemical markers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, liver function, and cell damage. Additionally, liver histopathology was examined to quantify the extent of fatty infiltration. RESULTS: In the tamoxifen + saline group, elevated levels of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cytokeratin 18, and soluble ST2 were observed compared to the normal control group, indicating increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and liver injury (p < 0.01). Moreover, histopathological examination revealed a significant increase in fatty infiltration (p < 0.001). However, in the tamoxifen + caffeine group, these markers were markedly reduced (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), and fatty infiltration was significantly mitigated (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that caffeine administration attenuates tamoxifen-induced fatty liver in rats by ameliorating oxidative stress, inflammation, liver injury, and cell damage. Histopathological evidence further supports the protective role of caffeine. This study highlights the potential of caffeine as a therapeutic intervention to counter tamoxifen-induced hepatic complications, contributing to the optimization of breast cancer treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine dependence is an important cause of excessive exposure to tobacco combustion compounds in most smokers. Nicotine replacement therapy is the main method to treat nicotine dependence, but it still has its shortcomings, such as the inability to mitigate withdrawal effects and limited applicability. It has been hypothesized that a combination of low-dose nicotine and caffeine could achieve the same psychological stimulation effect as a high dose of nicotine without causing nicotine withdrawal effects. To establish a model of nicotine dependence, male C57BL/6J mice were subcutaneously injected four times a day with nicotine (2 mg/kg) for 15 days and fed with water containing nicotine at the same time. They were randomly divided into four groups. After 24 h of withdrawal, different groups were injected with saline, nicotine (0.25 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg), or nicotine (0.1 mg/kg) and caffeine (20 mg/kg). Behavioral and physiological changes were evaluated by an assessment of physical signs, open field tests, elevated plus maze experiments, forced swimming tests, hot plate tests, and new-object-recognition tests. The changes in dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain were analyzed using ELISA. The results showed that a combination of caffeine and nicotine could effectively relieve nicotine withdrawal syndrome, increase movement ability and pain thresholds, reduce anxiety and depression, enhance memory and cognitive ability, and increase the level of dopamine release in the PFC and VTA. Thus, caffeine combined with nicotine has potential as a stable and effective treatment option to help humans with smoking cessation.",

(2) Methods: During the 56 days of the experiment, plants were treated weekly with 100 mL of 1 mM Zn (Zn), 1 mg L-1 caffeine trimethyl-13C (caffeine), and 1 mM Zn + 1 mg L-1 caffeine trimethyl-13C (Zn + caffeine) and compared to plants that were given tap water (control). (3) Results: Caffeine was taken up by the roots and translocated to the leaves, which positively influenced the number of fruits per plant. After 56 days of treatment, Zn induced a positive increase in tomato dry weight, reducing shoot length (-16.7%) compared to the other treatments. Zn + caffeine had a positive effect on the phenylpropanoid pathway of fruits, and 4-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and t-ferulic acid were significantly increased, as well as the total antioxidant capacity of the tomatoes. In the flavonoid pathway, only apigenin and luteolin contents were reduced by treatments. The tomatoes showed similar concentrations of the mineral elements Cu, Mn, Fe, Na, Ca, Mg, and K. The Zn and caffeine target hazard quotients were <1, indicating that health risks via the consumption of these tomatoes did not occur. (4) Conclusions: Tomato plants could be irrigated with water containing lower values of Zn, caffeine, and a combination of the two. The treated fruits are rich in antioxidant compounds, such as coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and t-ferulic acid, which are beneficial for human health. No considerable health risks associated with human consumption have been detected."

      "abstract": "Caffeine is one of the most commonly used drugs in intensive care to stimulate the respiratory control mechanisms of very preterm infants. Respiratory instability, due to the degree of immaturity at birth, results in apnea of prematurity (AOP), hyperoxic, hypoxic, and intermittent hypoxic episodes. Oxidative stress cannot be avoided as a direct reaction and leads to neurological developmental deficits and even a higher prevalence of respiratory diseases in the further development of premature infants. Due to the proven antioxidant effect of caffeine in early use, largely protective effects on clinical outcomes can be observed. This is also impressively observed in experimental studies of caffeine application in oxidative stress-adapted rodent models of damage to the developing brain and lungs. However, caffeine shows undesirable effects outside these oxygen toxicity injury models. This review shows the effects of caffeine in hyperoxic, hypoxic/hypoxic-ischemic, and intermittent hypoxic rodent injury models, but also the negative effects on the rodent organism when caffeine is administered without exogenous oxidative stress. The narrative analysis of caffeine benefits in cerebral and pulmonary preterm infant models supports protective caffeine use but should be given critical consideration when considering caffeine treatment beyond the recommended corrected gestational age."

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have suggested a strong association between paternal adverse environmental exposure and increased disease susceptibility in offspring. However, the impact of paternal pre-pregnant caffeine exposure (PPCE) on offspring health remains unexplored. This study elucidates the sperm reprogramming mechanism and potential intervention targets for PPCE-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in offspring. Here, male rats are administrated caffeine (15-60 mg kg-1/d) by gavage for 8 weeks and then mated with females to produce offspring. This study finds that NASH with transgenerational inheritance occurred in PPCE adult offspring. Mechanistically, a reduction of miR-142-3p is implicated in the occurrence of NASH, characterized by hepatic lipid metabolism dysfunction and chronic inflammation through an increase in ACSL4. Conversely, overexpression of miR-142-3p mitigated these manifestations. The origin of reduced miR-142-3p levels is traced to hypermethylation in the miR-142-3p promoter region of parental sperm, induced by elevated corticosterone levels rather than by caffeine per se. Similar outcomes are confirmed in offspring conceived via in vitro fertilization using miR-142-3pKO sperm. Overall, this study provides the first evidence of transgenerational inheritance of NASH in PPCE offspring and identifies miR-142-3p as a potential therapeutic target for NASH induced by paternal environmental adversities.",

Rats were divided into control rats, obese rats induced by high fat diet (HFD) and obese rats treated with LA and/or CCNPs. Obesity was confirmed by measuring the body mass index (BMI). Memory and cognitive functions were evaluated by novel object recognition test (NORT). The levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), lipid peroxidation (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), leptin (LEP) and ghrelin (GHR) and the activities of monoamine oxidase (MAO), acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and Na+,K+,ATPase were determined in the cortex and hippocampus. The cerebral histopathological alterations were examined in obese rats. Obese rats showed impaired memory and exhibited significant neurochemical changes, including decreased levels of 5-HT, DA, GSH, GHR, and Na+,K+-ATPase activity, as well as an increase in AchE, MAO, MDA, NO, IL-1β, TNF-α, and LEP. LA and/or CCNPs treatment reduced BMI and improved memory. LA or CCNPs alleviated the cortical and hippocampal neurochemical changes and histopathological changes induced by obesity. Furthermore, LA and CCNPs exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which likely contributed to their effects. However, no synergistic effect was observed between LA and CCNPs. These findings suggest that LA or CCNPs may be a potential therapy against obesity and its adverse effects on memory, mediated by their ability to restore monoamine levels and exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",

      "abstract": "Drug repurposing is a promising approach to identify new pharmacological indications for drugs that have already been established. However, there is still a limitation in the availability of a high-throughput in vivo preclinical system that is suitable for screening and investigating new pharmacological indications. The aim of this study was to introduce the application of Drosophila larvae as an in vivo platform to screen drug candidates with anti-aging and immunomodulatory activities. To determine whether Drosophila larvae can be utilized for assessing anti-aging and immunomodulatory activities, phenotypical and molecular assays were conducted using wildtype and mutant lines of Drosophila. The utilization of mutant lines (PGRP-LBΔ and Psh[1];;ModSP[KO]) mimics the autoinflammatory and immunodeficient conditions in humans, thereby enabling a thorough investigation of the effects of various compounds. The phenotypical assay was carried out using survival and locomotor observation in Drosophila larvae and adult flies. Meanwhile, the molecular assay was conducted using the RT-qPCR method. In vivo survival analysis revealed that caffeine was relatively safe for Drosophila larvae and exhibited the ability to extend Drosophila lifespan compared to the untreated controls, suggesting its anti-aging properties. Further analysis using the RT-qPCR method demonstrated that caffeine treatment induced transcriptional changes in the Drosophila larvae, particularly in the downstream of NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathways, two distinct immune-related pathways homologue to humans. In addition, caffeine enhanced the survival of Drosophila autoinflammatory model, further implying its immunosuppressive activity. Nevertheless, this compound had minimal to no effect on the survival of Staphylococcus aureus-infected wildtype and immunodeficient Drosophila, refuting its antibacterial and immunostimulant activities. Overall, our results suggest that the anti-aging and immunosuppressive activities of caffeine observed in Drosophila larvae align with those reported in mammalian model systems, emphasizing the suitability of Drosophila larvae as a model organism in drug repurposing endeavors, particularly for the screening of newly discovered chemical entities to assess their immunomodulatory activities before proceedings to investigations in mammalian animal models.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests as a movement and brain function disorder characterized by symptoms such as resting tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, leading to disability among patients. The use of psychostimulants such as caffeine has been associated with the improvement of motor symptoms in PD patients; however, studies regarding the effect of caffeine adjuvant therapy on motor function among PD patients in the Indonesian population are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate motor improvement as measured by the change in scores of the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (MDS-UPDRS-III) among PD patients receiving caffeine adjuvant. A double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted among PD patients at Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital and Universitas Airlangga Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, from April to August 2023. A total of 27 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to an intervention (receiving caffeine adjuvant, n=15) and control group (receiving placebo, n=12). Motor improvement was measured using the UPDRS III score prior to intervention and three weeks after. The Chi-squared test was used to analyze the difference in UPDRS III scores between the two groups. Motor improvement, as demonstrated by a reduction in the UPDRS III score, was observed in patients receiving caffeine adjuvant compared to those receiving placebo (80.0% vs 16.7%; p=0.004). Regarding the safety profile, only four out of 15 (26.6%) patients treated with caffeine reported minor adverse events. These conditions improved over time during the intervention. None of the 12 patients in the placebo reported adverse events. This study provides valuable insights into the initial dosage of caffeine that improves motor function in PD patients with minimum adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "We previously found that chronic adenosine A1 receptor stimulation with N6-Cyclopentyladenosine increased α-synuclein misfolding and neurodegeneration in a novel α-synucleinopathy model, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Here, we aimed to synthesize a dimer caffeine-indan linked by a 6-carbon chain to cross the blood-brain barrier and tested its ability to bind α-synuclein, reducing misfolding, behavioral abnormalities, and neurodegeneration in our rodent model. Behavioral tests and histological stains assessed neuroprotective effects of the dimer compound. A rapid synthesis of the 18F-labeled analogue enabled Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography imaging for biodistribution measurement. Molecular docking analysis showed that the dimer binds to α-synuclein N- and C-termini and the non-amyloid-β-component (NAC) domain, similar to 1-aminoindan, and this binding promotes a neuroprotective α-synuclein \"loop\" conformation. The dimer also binds to the orthosteric binding site for adenosine within the adenosine A1 receptor. Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging showed the dimer abolished α-synuclein upregulation and aggregation in the substantia nigra and hippocampus, and the dimer mitigated cognitive deficits, anxiety, despair, and motor abnormalities. The 18F-labeled dimer remained stable post-injection and distributed in various organs, notably in the brain, suggesting its potential as a Positron Emission Tomography tracer for α-synuclein and adenosine A1 receptor in Parkinson's disease therapy.",

METHODS: Eight players (23.5±5.7 years) participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. Sixty minutes before the start of each game, players ingested a dose of either CAF (3 mg/kg body mass) or placebo (PLA) in a randomized order. Game-related statistics were collected. After the games, players reported ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and their perceptions of endurance and power. Separate linear mixed models evaluated the effects of treatment (CAF, PLA), game location (home, away), and opponent level (better, worse) on game-related statistics and perceptual responses. RESULTS: Players committed fewer fouls when taking CAF compared to PLA (P<0.001, ES=0.75, moderate). No effects of CAF were found for the other game-related statistics (all P>0.05). RPE was higher in CAF compared to PLA (P=0.031, ES: 0.49, small). There were no differences in perceptions of endurance (P=0.388) or power (P=0.988). No effects of game location or opponent level were found for game-related statistics or perceptual responses (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that caffeine supplementation can improve defensive performance in semiprofessional basketball players while also possibly increasing physical performances, seen the higher RPE.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, works as a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. It is the most widely used psychostimulant drug worldwide. However, caffeine overdose can lead to acute intoxication, posing a clinical problem. Hyperthermia and hyperactivity are associated issues with acute caffeine intoxication; however, no definitive treatment exists. This study aimed to assess the ability of risperidone to attenuate caffeine-induced hyperthermia and hyperactivity while elucidating the unknown mechanisms of caffeine intoxication. The rats received intraperitoneal injections of saline, risperidone (0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg), WAY-100635, ketanserin, haloperidol, sulpiride, or SCH 23390, 5 min after the administration of caffeine (25 mg/kg). Subcutaneous temperature and activity counts were measured using nano tag ® for up to 90 min. In vivo microdialysis was used to determine the effect of risperidone on caffeine-induced elevation of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and noradrenaline (NA) concentrations in the anterior hypothalamus. Rats were injected with caffeine (25 mg/kg), followed by saline or risperidone (0.5 mg/kg) 5 min later. The levels of DA, 5-HT, and noradrenaline were measured every 15 min for up to 90 min after caffeine administration. Risperidone and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin attenuated caffeine-induced hyperthermia and hyperactivity. Haloperidol and dopamine D1 antagonist SCH-23390 exacerbated hyperthermia without any effect on the hyperactivity. In the microdialysis study, risperidone treatment further attenuated caffeine-induced 5-HT elevation, but not DA and NA. Our results indicate that risperidone attenuates caffeine-induced hyperthermia and hyperactivity by blocking 5-HT2A receptor activity and may be potentially useful for treating caffeine intoxication.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The guidelines recommend early caffeine administration for preterm infants requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation since earlier treatment is associated with better outcomes. The objective was to evaluate the impact of early caffeine therapy (within 24 hours after birth) on respiratory outcomes in very preterm infants who were initially receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This was an observation cohort study from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022 based on a database that was prospectively collected and maintained. Infants who initially received invasive mechanical ventilation were divided into two groups based on the timing of caffeine initiation: within the first 24 hours after birth (early) and within 48 hours of birth or later (late). Generalised linear mixed models with a random effect model for the centre were used to assess the impact of different caffeine initiation times on neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Among the cohort of 9880 infants born at <32 weeks gestation, 2381 were eligible for this study (early initiation: 1758 (73.8%) and late initiation: 623 (26.2%)). For infants born at more than 28 weeks of gestation, the adjusted generalised linear mixed model showed that the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 1.34 (95% CI -2.40 to -0.27) days shorter and the incidence of moderate-to-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was lower (adjusted OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96) in the early caffeine group compared with the late caffeine group. CONCLUSION: In very preterm infants who initially receive invasive mechanical ventilation, early administration of caffeine within 24 hours after birth can shorten the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, reduce the incidence of moderate-to-severe BPD and improve respiratory outcomes. The very early initiation of caffeine treatment does not appear to be associated with any adverse outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR1900025234.",

This review describes the influence of caffeine on the cardiovascular system, with a special focus on blood platelets. For many years, caffeine was thought to have a negative effect on the cardiovascular system mainly due to increasing blood pressure. However, more recent data suggest that habitual caffeine consumption may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. This could be a significant finding as cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Caffeine is known to inhibit A1 adenosine receptors, through which it is believed to modulate inter alia coronary blood flow, total peripheral resistance, diuresis, and heart rate. It has been shown that coffee possesses antiplatelet activity, but depending on the dose and the term of its use, caffeine may stimulate or inhibit platelet reactivity. Also, chronic exposure to caffeine may sensitize or upregulate the adenosine receptors in platelets causing increased cAMP accumulation and anti-aggregatory effects and decrease calcium levels elicited by AR agonists. The search for new, selective, and safe AR agonists is one of the new strategies for improving antiplatelet therapy involving targeting multiple pathways of platelet activation. Therefore, this review examines the AR-dependent impact of caffeine on blood platelets in the presence of adenosine receptor agonists.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine, the main psychoactive component in coffee, has garnered significant attention for its potential impact on the most prevalent mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. This chapter comprehensively examines the neurobiological effects of caffeine, its influence on anxiety and depression, and relevant clinical studies. Caffeine exerts its psychostimulant effects primarily through antagonizing adenosine receptors, modulating neurotransmitter systems, and influencing intracellular calcium signaling in the brain. Caffeine exhibits dose-dependent effects. While moderate caffeine consumption is safe in healthy adults and may offer benefits for mental health, excessive intake is linked to adverse effects on neurological and psychiatric health and can aggravate symptoms, highlighting the importance of adjusting consumption patterns. High caffeine intake correlates with elevated anxiety levels, especially in individuals predisposed to anxiety disorders. However, the relationship between caffeine consumption and the risk of depression is intricate, with some studies suggesting a potential protective effect of moderate intake, while others find no significant association. Individual variations in caffeine metabolism, sensitivity, and genetic factors considerably impact responses to caffeine. The chapter also explores the therapeutic potential of caffeine as an adjunct treatment and outlines challenges and future research directions in elucidating caffeine's multifaceted role in mental health.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: After mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), the brain is labile for weeks and months and vulnerable to repeated concussions. During this time, patients are exposed to everyday circumstances that, in themselves, affect brain metabolism and blood flow and neural processing. How commonplace activities interact with the injured brain is unknown. The present study in an animal model investigated the extent to which three commonly experienced exposures-daily caffeine usage, chronic sleep loss, and chronic sleep aid medication-affect the injured brain in the chronic phase. METHODS: Subclinical trauma by repeated mTBIs was produced by our head rotational acceleration injury model, which causes brain injury consistent with the mechanism of concussion in humans. Forty-eight hours after a third mTBI, chronic administrations of caffeine, sleep restriction, or zolpidem (sedative hypnotic) began and were continued for 70 days. On Days 30 and 60 post injury, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed. RESULTS: Chronic caffeine, sleep restriction, and zolpidem each changed the subclinical brain characteristics of mTBI at both 30 and 60 days post injury, detected by different MRI modalities. Each treatment caused microstructural alterations in DTI metrics in the insular cortex and retrosplenial cortex compared with mTBI, but also uniquely affected other gray and white matter regions. Zolpidem administration affected the largest number of individual structures in mTBI at both 30 and 60 days, and not necessarily toward normalization (sham treatment). Chronic sleep restriction changed local functional connectivity at 30 days in diametrical opposition to chronic caffeine ingestion, and both treatment outcomes were different from sham, mTBI-only and zolpidem comparisons. The results indicate that commonly encountered exposures modify subclinical brain activity and structure long after healing is expected to be complete. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in activity and structure detected by fMRI are widely understood to reflect changes in the functions of the affected region which conceivably underlie mTBI neuropathology and symptomatology in the chronic phase after injury.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is frequently used for the treatment of apnea in preterm babies. Its mechanism of action includes not only antagonism of adenosine receptors on central nervous system but also an increase in electrical activity of the diaphragm. Caffeine's direct effect on diaphragm was investigated via electromyography, but ultrasound has not been used to show visible changes in muscles after the treatment before. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of caffeine on diaphragmatic function through ultrasonographic examination. It was a prospective observational study. Fifty-six participants receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure with less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestational age born were enrolled. Diaphragmatic thickness, amplitude of excursion, and velocity of movement were measured before and within 5 minutes after caffeine loading dose and compared to each other. The protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04483492. Diaphragmatic thicknesses and diaphragmatic velocity of movement did not differ after the treatment. However, amplitude of excursion of the diaphragm was found significantly higher after caffeine loading dose (8.7 mm, 10mm, respectively, P < .05). Diaphragm excursion increased after caffeine treatment in preterm babies, and this finding was potentially supported the direct effect of the caffeine on diaphragm. Another important finding of this study is that it reinforces the utility of ultrasonography in assessing diaphragmatic function in preterm infants."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have found that the use of clinically approved caffeine and modafinil can alleviate cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation (SD) to some extent. However, the neural mechanisms by which these two cognitive enhancers work to counteract the effects of SD on cognitive impairment remain unclear. METHODS: A double-blind within-subjects experiment using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was designed. Participants underwent three 36-h SD trials, each of which involved taking 200 mg of caffeine, modafinil, or placebo at the 28th and 32 nd h of SD. Sixteen subregions of the thalamus were selected as the regions of interest and changes in functional connectivity (FC) between the thalamus and the other brain regions were explored after the participants took caffeine or modafinil. RESULTS: The subjective sleepiness of the participants increased with the duration of SD. compared with placebo, modafinil and caffeine had insignificant effects on wakefulness or sleepiness. However, in terms of neural FC, we found varying degrees of attenuation or enhancement of the FC between the thalamus and other regions. Taking caffeine during SD weakened the FC between the right rostral temporal thalamus (rTtha) subregion and the left lingual gyrus compared with placebo. Caffeine enhanced the FC between three subregions of the thalamus, namely the left sensory thalamus, the left rTtha, and the right lateral pre-frontal thalamus, and the right inferior temporal, left orbitofrontal, and right superior occipital gyris. Modafinil weakened the FC between the right posterior parietal thalamus and left middle temporal gyrus, and enhanced the FC between the left medial pre-frontal thalamus, left rTtha, and right occipital thalamus and left middle frontal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: After 36 h of total SD, modafinil and caffeine administration enhanced or attenuated the time-domain correlations between various subregions of the thalamus and brain regions of the frontal and temporal lobes in healthy adults, compared with placebo. These results provide valuable evidence for further unraveling the neuropharmacological mechanisms of caffeine and modafinil, as well as important insights for exploring effective pharmacological intervention strategies against SD.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions, leading to cognitive impairment, with no cure and preventive measures. Misfolding and aberrant aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are believed to be the underlying cause of AD. These amyloid aggregates culminate in the development of toxic Aβ oligomers and subsequent accumulation of β-amyloid plaques amidst neuronal cells in the brain, marking the hallmarks of AD. Drug development for the potentially curative treatment of Alzheimer's is, therefore, a tremendous challenge for the scientific community. In this study, we investigate the potency of Whitlock's caffeine-armed molecular tweezer in combating the deleterious effects of Aβ aggregation, with special emphasis on the seven residue Aβ16-22 fragment. Extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are conducted to probe the various structural and conformational transitions of the peptides in an aqueous medium in both the presence and absence of tweezers. To explore the specifics of peptide-tweezer interactions, radial distribution functions, contact number calculations, binding free energies, and 2-D kernel density plots depicting the variation of distance-angle between the aromatic planes of the peptide-tweezer pair are computed. The central hydrophobic core, particularly the aromatic Phe residues, is crucial in the development of harmful amyloid oligomers. Notably, all analyses indicate reduced interpeptide interactions in the presence of the tweezer, which is attributed to the tweezer-Phe aromatic interaction. Upon increasing the tweezer concentration, the residues of the peptide are further encased in a hydrophobic environment created by the self-aggregating tweezer cluster, leading to the segregation of the peptide residues. This is further aided by the weakening of interstrand hydrogen bonding between the peptides, thereby impeding their self-aggregation and preventing the formation of neurotoxic β-amyloid. Furthermore, the study also highlights the efficacy of the molecular tweezer in destabilizing preformed amyloid fibrils as well as hindering the aggregation of the full-length Aβ1-42 peptide.",

Caffeine-loaded TECs were prepared using thin film hydration method applying 23 factorial design to study the impact of different factors, each with two levels on the entrapment efficiency (EE%), particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (ZP) of the formulated TECs. The studied factors were cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) amount (mg) (X1), phosphatidylcholine (PC) amount (mg) (X2), and Transcutol® amount (mg) (X3). Design-Expert® software was utilized to determine the optimum TECs formulation. Afterward, the optimum TECs formulation was loaded into a gel and subjected to extra investigations. The optimum TECs formulation was (TEC5) which was prepared using 10 mg of CTAB, 150 mg of PC, and 10 mg of Transcutol®. TEC5 presented EE% of 87.44 ± 0.14 %, PS of 308.60 ± 13.38 nm, PDI of 0.455 ± 0.030, and ZP of 50.20 ± 1.55 mV. TEC5 had a fiber-like morphology, with elongated tubules of ceramide. Further, the optimum TECs formulation showed a high stability profile. Moreover, an in vivo dermatokinetic study showed superior deposition of caffeine from TEC5 gel coupled with the sonophoresis on rat skin compared to TEC5 gel and caffeine gel. Moreover, the histopathological study of TEC5 on rat skin confirmed the non-irritant nature of TEC 5 gel mediated by ultrasonic waves through the skin. Overall, the outcomes exposed the obvious superiority of sonophoresis delivered TECs-gel for topical delivery of caffeine for cellulite management.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the impact of caffeine (CAF) encapsulated in transferrin-modified, sterically-stabilized liposomes (Tf-SSL) on the physical performance of rats, specifically forelimb grip strength, running, and swimming. The brain-targeted drug delivery system, Tf-SSL, was used for the administration of caffeine. 168 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to different groups, including swimming, running, running wheel, and strength groups. Each group was further subdivided into high, medium, and low dose free caffeine (HCAF, MCAF, LCAF) and Tf-SSL CAF groups, along with a control group (CON). The strength, swimming, and running groups underwent training for four weeks, three times per week. The running wheel group was placed in rearing cages for a one-week adaptation period. After the final training session, the resistance, swimming, running, and running wheel exercise capacities of the rats were tested. The rats were administered treatment via tail vein injection, while the blank CON group received 0.9 % saline solution without treatment throughout the entire process. The results demonstrated a Tf-SSL CAF group encapsulation rate of 70.58 ± 5.14 %. Increasing the concentration of supplemented caffeine led to enhanced forelimb grip strength in rats, with significant differences observed in HCAF alone group, medium-dose Tf-SSL CAF (MTf-SSL CAF), and high-dose Tf-SSL CAF (HTf-SSL CAF) groups compared to the CON group. In the running and swimming experiments, higher caffeine supplementation concentrations correlated with increased running and swimming time to exhaustion, and the MTf-SSL CAF group showed longer running and swimming time compared to the HCAF alone group. The results of rat striatal dopamine levels indicated that increased caffeine supplementation concentrations led to higher dopamine secretion, with significantly different striatal concentrations in the HCAF group, MTf-SSL CAF group, and HTf-SSL CAF group compared to the CON group. The running wheel experiment revealed that rats in the medium- and high-dose Tf-SSL CAF groups exhibited greater 6-h running distances than the HCAF group and CON group. In conclusion, caffeine supplementation improved the physical performance of rats, with the high concentration CAF group outperforming the low and medium concentration groups. Furthermore, Tf-SSL CAF demonstrated superior physical enhancement compared to caffeine supplementation alone."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Circadian rhythms impact metabolism and the therapeutic effects of drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between PER and CRY polymorphisms and caffeine citrate treatment response in infants with apnea of prematurity. METHODS: A total of 221 preterm infants of gestational age <34 weeks were included in this study (160 in the response group and 61 in the non-response group). The propensity score matching method was used to perform a 1:1 matching for all premature infants, and the general characteristics and clinical outcomes of the two groups were compared. The association between polymorphisms of the circadian transcription repressors PER and CRY and caffeine citrate treatment response in infants with apnea of prematurity was analyzed with co-dominant, dominant, recessive, and over-dominant models, as well as analysis of alleles. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis was used to analyze the interaction between the PER and CRY genes. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 45 preterm infants were included in each of the response and non-response groups, and there were no statistically significant differences in general characteristics between the two groups (P > 0.05). Infants in the non-response groups had a higher incidence of moderate and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (P = 0.043), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (P = 0.035), and invasive ventilation (P = 0.027), and their duration of oxygen use (P = 0.041) was longer. When corrected for false discovery rate, the PER3 rs228669 recessive model (P FDR   = 0.045) and the over-dominant model (P FDR = 0.045) were both associated with caffeine citrate treatment response. Preterm infants with the rs228669 CC genotype had a significantly lower rate of caffeine citrate non-response in the recessive model (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.12-0.66), which was significantly higher in preterm infants with the CT genotype in the over-dominant model (OR = 4.18, 95% CI = 1.64-10.66). GMDR analysis revealed an interaction between the PER and CRY genes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Circadian rhythms may play a role in the response of premature infants to caffeine citrate, and polymorphisms of the PER and CRY genes may influence the effectiveness of caffeine citrate treatment for apnea of prematurity."

      "abstract": "Apnoea of prematurity (AOP) is a common complication among preterm infants (< 37 weeks gestation), globally. However, access to caffeine citrate (CC) that is a proven safe and effective treatment in high-income countries is largely unavailable in low- and-middle income countries, where most preterm infants are born. Therefore, the overall aim of this study was to describe the demand, policies, and supply factors affecting the availability and clinical use of CC in LMICs. A mixed methods approach was used to collect data from diverse settings in LMICs including Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and India. Qualitative semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with 107 different health care providers, and 21 policymakers and other stakeholders from industry. Additional data was collected using standard questionnaires. A thematic framework approach was used to analyze the qualitative data and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the quantitative data. The findings indicate that there is variation in in-country policies on the use of CC in the prevention and treatment of AOP and its availability across the LMICs. As a result, the knowledge and experience of using CC also varied with clinicians in Ethiopia having no experience of using it while those in India have greater knowledge and experience of using it. This, in turn, influenced the demand, and our findings show that only 29% of eligible preterm infants are receiving CC in these countries. There is an urgent need to address the multilevel barriers to accessing CC for managing AOP in Africa. These include cost, lack of national policies, and, therefore, lack of demand stemming from its clinical equivalency with aminophylline. Practical ways to reduce the cost of CC in LMICs could potentially increase its availability and use."

Its complexity, which is evident at the genetic and phenotypic levels, contributes to its diversity and resistance to treatment. Numerous scientific investigations on human and animal models demonstrate the potential of phytochemicals in cancer prevention. Coffee has been shown to possess potent anti-carcinogenic properties, and studies have documented the consumption of coffee as a beverage reduces the risk of cancer occurrence. The major secondary metabolites of coffee, named caffeine and chlorogenic acid, have been linked to anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic effects through various signaling. In light of this, this review article provides a comprehensive analysis based on studies in anticancer effects of coffee, chlorogenic acid, and caffeine published between 2010 and 2023, sourced from Scopus, Pubmed, and Google Scholar databases. We summarize recent advances and scientific evidence on the association of phytochemicals found in coffee with a special emphasis on their biological activities against cancer and their molecular mechanism deemed potential to be used as a novel therapeutic target for cancer prevention and therapy.",
