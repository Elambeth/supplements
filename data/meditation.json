      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction and reduced heart rate variability (HRV). Enhancing HRV may help mitigate symptoms of panic disorder. This study investigated the effects of Rajyoga mindfulness meditation training on HRV in patients with panic disorder. METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial included 110 patients with panic disorder recruited from a psychiatry department in India. Participants were randomized to either an 8-week Rajyoga meditation intervention (n = 55) or a waitlist control group (n = 55) receiving standard treatment alone. HRV was measured at baseline and after 8 weeks using time domain (SDRR, RMSSD, pNN50) and frequency domain (total power, HF, LF, LF/HF ratio) parameters. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences in demographics or HRV parameters between groups. After 8 weeks, the Rajyoga group showed significant increases in SDRR, RMSSD, pNN50, and total power compared to controls (P < 0.05), indicating improved parasympathetic activity. The LF/HF ratio decreased in the Rajyoga group versus controls, suggesting a shift toward parasympathetic predominance. CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of Rajyoga mindfulness meditation training improved HRV and parasympathetic activity in patients with panic disorder compared to standard treatment alone. Rajyoga meditation may be a beneficial adjunctive intervention for enhancing autonomic regulation in panic disorder."

Meditation improves stress and well-being, with group interventions more promising than individual-level efforts. This study assessed participation, satisfaction, helpfulness, and integration of a five-minute group meditation during weekly educational rounds. Methods: Seventy clinicians were invited to complete an anonymous Qualtrics survey assessing study variables. Responses were analyzed using variations of t-tests, ANOVAs, chi-squared tests, and regression analyses in IBM SPSS (Version 23). Results: Twenty-three clinicians (59%) reported participation in meditation during rounds, with no significant differences by gender or years worked. Twenty-one respondents also engaged in meditation at least weekly outside of rounds (54%), averaging 53 minutes (n = 21) a week, and doing so mostly after work hours (n = 18, 72%). Participation was associated with perceived stress reduction and control, and satisfaction with meditation (odds ratio: 1.46 [95% confidence interval: 1.01-2.13], p = 0.05). Clinicians in psychosocial roles showed no different engagement outside of rounds, and those less engaged did not report greater time-related barriers. Discussion: Most round attendants participated in the five-minute meditation, perceived it as useful, and reported use after rounds. Findings justify further research to better characterize its potential in enhancing well-being."

This study examines the impact of different parenting styles on internet addiction and the role of parental mediation on the relationship among Chinese children. A survey of 600 Chinese families with children aged 6 to 17 was conducted in 2024. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), the results reveal that authoritative parenting is linked to lower levels of internet addiction, while authoritarian and permissive parenting are associated with higher levels. Parental mediation partly mediates this relationship, with authoritative parents who are actively involved with their children's internet activities showing a reduced risk of addiction. The findings highlight that both parenting style and parental intervention are key factors in addressing internet addiction among Chinese children. Encouraging authoritative parenting alongside active mediation may help children mitigate internet addiction.",

Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies on meditation as treatment for PTSD (61 studies) found a moderate effect size of Hedges's g = -0.67 for post-minus-pre change in symptom scores. Separate tests of the four meditation categories found a large effect size of g = -1.13 for the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique that is significantly greater than for each other category. The present follow-up used a different method, calculating effects relative to internal controls, to better characterize the effects of this meditation technique. Materials and Methods. Our study followed Prisma guidelines. Major databases, research anthologies, and bibliographies were searched for studies that used TM for treating PTSD, all military and civilian populations, and all age groups. Results. The searches located 15 controlled trials on TM that met the inclusion criteria (longitudinal and reporting sufficient statistics to calculate effect sizes), 1248 subjects total, mean age 40.5 years (range 20.6 to 54.4 years), and 46.9% males (range 0% to 100%). Using the random effects model, the pooled effect across all studies of TM compared to other treatments was g = -1.01, 95% CI = -1.29 to -0.74, p < 0.000000001. One-study removed analysis found that no study reduced the pooled effect to less than -1.0. Funnel plots indicated no risk of bias. TM was non-inferior to prolonged exposure therapy, p = 0.0001, and it worked significantly faster (p = 0.04 at week six). Conclusions. TM produced clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD for civilian and military personnel, young and older adults, and for both men and women. We recommend phase-III multisite studies comparing TM with known first-line treatments for PTSD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Probation officers and other professionals who work with youth in the legal system often experience high chronic workplace stress, which can contribute over time to elevations in anxiety, depression, and workplace burnout. Emotion dysregulation appears to function as a common mechanism underlying these elevations, and growing evidence suggests it can be improved with mindfulness meditation. Implemented successfully, app-based meditation programs could provide professionals with real-time tools for mitigating the effects of chronic workplace stress. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Bodhi AIM+, a meditation app adapted with and for professionals who work with youth in the legal system. The adaptation process and implementation plan, as well as the pilot RCT design, were guided by theoretically driven implementation science frameworks. The primary outcome of the pilot RCT is app adherence (ie, ongoing app usage per objective analytics data). METHODS: The RCT will be fully remote. Officers and other professionals who work with youth in the legal system (N=50) will be individually randomized to use the meditation app or an active control app matched for time and structure. All participants will be asked to follow a 30-day path of brief audio- or video-guided content and invited to use additional app features as desired. In-app analytics will capture the objective usage of each feature. An adaptive engagement design will be employed to engage nonusers of both apps, whereby analytics data indicating nonuse will trigger additional support (eg, text messages promoting engagement). Mental health outcomes and potential moderators and covariates will be self-reported at baseline, posttest, and 6 months. Participants will also complete 1-week bursts of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) at baseline and over the last week of the intervention to capture the mechanistic target (ie, emotion regulation) in real time. All participants will be invited to complete qualitative posttest interviews. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative data. Qualitative data will be analyzed using a combined deductive-inductive approach. The quantitative and qualitative data will be incorporated into a mixed methods triangulation design, allowing for the evaluation of app adherence and other implementation outcomes as well as related barriers and facilitators to implementation. RESULTS: Enrollment into the trial started in December 2024 and is currently underway. Study results are anticipated to be available in 2026. CONCLUSIONS: Completion of this pilot trial will inform a future, fully powered RCT to formally evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of Bodhi AIM+. Its use of implementation science methods, coupled with digital technology, positions the present study not only to help make meditation tools available to an important workforce at scale but also to inform broader efforts at implementing and evaluating health apps within workplace settings.

      "abstract": "The rise in mental health conditions and stress has attracted global attention. Non-pharmacological and traditional approaches like meditative practices are showing promising results. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of Heartfulness meditation on stress biomarkers, burnout, and well-being. A double-arm prospective randomized controlled study was carried out on 100 participants aged between 18 and 24 years, experiencing moderate to high perceived stress as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). These participants were randomized into a study group (meditation) and control group (sham meditation). An intervention of Heartfulness meditation was carried out daily for 12 weeks. Psychometric analysis was carried out to study burnout (exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy) and well-being using the standard validated questionnaires- Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and WHO-Well-being Index (WHO-WBI). Biochemical analysis was also carried out to study psychological stress (serum cortisol), and oxidative stress (serum nitrate/nitrite and serum malondialdehyde (MDA) at baseline and post-intervention. Statistical analysis was carried out using the IBM SPSS software version 26.0. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A significant increase in serum nitrate/nitrite levels, professional efficacy, and well-being, and a significant decrease in measures such as exhaustion, cynicism, and cortisol levels were observed in the study group than the control group post-intervention. A significant negative correlation was also observed between serum MDA and well-being, whereas a positive correlation was observed between MDA and cortisol. The findings from this research suggest the role of Heartfulness meditation in reducing stress and burnout along with improving the well-being of an individual. Therefore, Heartfulness meditation can be used as a potential tool to improve mental health and well-being. However, future studies with a larger number of samples are needed to strengthen our findings.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: App-based mindfulness meditation programs have shown mixed effects in reducing stress levels. These studies have typically relied on limited assessments of dimensions of stress and on pre-post designs to detect effects. PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial examined the effect of the mindfulness meditation app Headspace on reducing subjective stress, stressor appraisals, perceived coping, and perseverative cognitions. It tested stress-reducing effects in everyday life throughout an eight-week intervention period. METHOD: Non-faculty employees (n = 138; age M = 38.19; 75.36% female; 54.5% White, 27.54% Hispanic; 51.45% with a professional degree) from a university in California's Central Valley were randomized into either the Headspace condition (instructed to complete 10 minutes of meditation daily) or wait-list (inactive) control group. Participants completed ecological momentary assessments of stress five times a day for four consecutive days at baseline, at two and five weeks after randomization (mid-intervention), and at eight weeks post-randomization (post-intervention), resulting in 6260 observations of stress dimensions. RESULTS: Hierarchical linear models were used to test the interaction of condition by time, revealing significant effects for subjective stress, perceived coping, and perseverative cognitions. By week 2, compared to the baseline, participants in the Headspace condition reported less subjective stress and perseverative cognitions, and by week 5 reported more perceived coping. These effects persisted through week 8. No changes were observed for stressor appraisal. Participants in the control condition reported increases in subjective stress and perseverative cognitions, and decreases in coping, throughout the intervention period. DISCUSSION: Headspace was effective at reducing stress in a high-stress environment. Findings suggest the potential for relatively quick and sustained gains in stress benefits from meditation practice that may help practitioners develop their future programs.",

The current research aimed to investigate whether long-term mindfulness meditation (MM) intervention enhances male athletes' attentional function and alters the activity of brain regions related to attention. In this experiment, we recruited 47 professional male fencer athletes completed two main trials-an MM trial and a control trial. In MM trial, the participants were provided with 3 sessions/wk (20 min/session) of mindfulness meditation training for 20 weeks. In control trial, the participants were instead assigned a mind-wandering related audio to listen to at that time. In each main trial, the five facets of mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ), cognitive function (i.e. attention span, attention concentrativeness, attention stability, attentional network, distractibility and attentional blink), salivary cortisol, blood lactate and mental fatigue were measured at baseline (pretest) and after the intervention (posttest). The cerebral oxygenation status was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy(fNIRS) during the cognitive function test. In cognition test, participants' attention span, attention concentrativeness, attention stability, attentional networks on task-relevant information (targets) were better in the MM group, supported by eliciting increased oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO) concentration in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Conversely, there are no remarkable different of distractibility and attentional blink on task-irrelevant information in the MM group than in the Con group (p > 0.05). Moreover, a lower mental fatigue level and lower salivary cortisol concentration were observed in the MM group than in the Con group after the intervention at posttest. Overall, 20-week MM training interventions after physical training improve attentive capacity and cerebral oxygenation concentration, decrease salivary cortisol concentrations and mental fatigue. The findings suggest that long-term MM training interventions after physical training facilitates focus during competition and improves athletic performance.",

We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 96 patients in an 11-bed surgical ICU at a South Korean university hospital. The control group received usual sleep care, whereas the intervention group received an additional 20-minute virtual reality-based mindfulness and relaxation meditation before bedtime. Using the Verran and Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale, we found significantly improved subjective sleep quality in the intervention group compared with controls during both the first (47.82 vs 39.75, P = .015) and second nights (50.26 vs 43.65, P = .025) of ICU admission. However, objective sleep measurements using Fitbit devices showed no significant differences in total sleep time between groups for either the first (384.59 vs 358.19 minutes, P = .450) or second night (319.94 vs 310.77 minutes, P = .807). Delirium incidence was similar between groups (12.2% vs 12.8%, P = .938). These findings suggest the need for larger-scale studies with robust experimental designs to definitively establish the impact of virtual reality meditation on sleep quality and delirium in ICU patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breath-awareness practices contribute to stress management and psychological well-being among adolescents. However, their neurobehavioural effects remain underexplored, specifically in the Indian developmental context. PURPOSE: This study examined how breath-based Ānāpānasati meditation affects brain electrical activity and the subjective self-reported experiences in adolescent novice meditators posteriori a cognitive workload-inducing task. METHODS: Anapanasati meditation was adapted into a three-stage breath-awareness intervention framework and was administered to 45 novice adolescent meditators. Brain activity was investigated through electroencephalography (EEG), and neural oscillations were measured over the three stages, namely resting state (RS), breath counting (BC) and breath focus (BF). Further, adolescents' breath awareness self-reports were evaluated employing the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ) following the BF stage and the breath count feedback (BCF) after the BC stage. Both the inventories displayed satisfactory psychometric properties, thus facilitating a neurobehavioural analysis in a cross-sectional within-subjects setting. RESULTS: Alpha oscillation was significantly increased throughout the intervention, indicating relaxation. Beta power in both the occipital and midline default mode network (DMN) regions during the count and focus stages exhibited significant positive associations with breath count, suggesting enhanced visual and cognitive processing. Blissfulness felt during counting breaths was also associated with enhanced state mindfulness, sharing a notable negative association with the theory of mind (TOM). State mindfulness further correlated with increased frontal alpha activity, while the theory of mind negatively predicted frontal alpha power. Lastly, exploratory analysis revealed gender differences, with females demonstrating greater frontal beta activity and state mindfulness. CONCLUSION: Breath-awareness meditation can thus be effective for promoting relaxation and blissfulness in adolescents, with possible gender-based variations influencing its impact. Moreover, the positive association of prefrontal alpha with self-reported state mindfulness and its negative association with TOM underscored an inverse interplay between inward-focused mindfulness and outward-directed social cognitive states in adolescents."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Meditation is well known for its positive effects on recovery and quality of life enhancement among cancer patients. Meditation as an adjuvant therapy has received extensive attention from international scholars in relieving pain, reducing psychological pressure and improving the quality of life of cancer patients. In this study, we examine the current status of meditation in cancer research and its potential application value and future development. METHODS: We collected 825 articles published in the Web of science Core Collection between January 1, 1976, and July 1, 2024, covering 11 cancer types. Bibliometric tools such as VOSviewer, Citespace, and Biblioshiny were used to analyze publication trends, international collaborations, author contributions, keywords, co-citations, and journal impact. RESULTS: First, the steadily rising number of publications indicates an increasing scholarly focus on meditation's benefits for patients. Second, the USA, Australia, and China are the countries with the highest number of publications in each of the three clusters. Additionally, Carlson Linda E and eight other scholars are influential scholars in this field. Finally, through keyword co-occurrence and co-citation analysis, we identified \"breast cancer,\" \"quality of life,\" and \"psychological intervention\" as the hot topics of current research. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides a valuable reference for scientific researchers to further explore meditation in cancer treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This study highlights the growing interest in meditation as an adjuvant therapy for cancer patients, underscoring its potential to improve survivors' quality of life. Current research primarily focuses on quality of life, mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy, and clinical trials. Additionally, online, virtual reality technology, cancer survivors, fear of cancer recurrence, and qualitative research may become cutting-edge research directions in the future."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Black Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Psychosocial stress contributes to this disparity. Previous studies reported that the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique reduced CVD risk factors, surrogate endpoints, and clinical events in high-risk populations. However, no study has evaluated the effects of stress reduction with meditation on surrogate CVD markers such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) along with CVD clinical events. Therefore, this randomized clinical trial evaluated the long-term effects of meditation and health education (HE) on cIMT and CVD events in high-risk Black adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were Black women and men with CVD or at high risk who were randomized to either TM or HE. The primary outcome was a change in cIMT measured using B-mode ultrasound at baseline and 12 months. The main secondary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 5 years (maximum) of follow-up. Other secondary outcomes were MACE at 1 and 10 years of follow-up, blood pressure, and serum lipids after 1 year. Exploratory variables were a comparison of cIMT changes to historical controls and MACE after 14 years. RESULTS: There were 197 randomized participants, of whom 136 completed posttest for cIMT. After 1 year, the TM and HE groups showed average cIMT changes of -0.0004 and -0.0003 mm, respectively, with no significant difference between the groups. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the groups in lipid levels or BP. However, both TM and HE groups showed prevention of progression of cIMT compared to historical controls at 12 months. In the survival analysis of MACE, there was a 65% relative risk reduction in the TM group after 5 (maximum) years of follow-up (HR = 0.346; 95% CI = 0.134-0.893; p = 0.017). At 1 and 10 years of follow-up, there were significant risk reductions in the TM vs. HE group, which was not significant at 14 years (all yearly maximums). DISCUSSION: Both treatment groups demonstrated prevention of progression of cIMT over 12 months compared to historical controls. However, the TM group showed a relative risk reduction for MACE of 65% at 5 years. Therefore, as a lifestyle modification method, TM may be useful in the secondary prevention of CVD in this and possibly other high-risk groups.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rates of burnout, depression, and anxiety among healthcare workers are at historically high levels and have remained high in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. As aspiring physicians, medical students are the future of the healthcare profession. The practice of Transcendental Meditation (TM) has been shown to reduce burnout and stress in diverse populations, including healthcare professionals. To date, no data have been published on the benefits of TM for medical students. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of TM practice in reducing burnout and increasing resilience among medical students at Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUSoM) over three months between October 2022 and May 2023. METHODS: Forty-two GUSoM medical students qualified for and enrolled in the study. Thirty-nine students completed three months of TM training and practice, with the recommended regimen of meditating for 20 min twice a day. The students were assessed at baseline, one month, and three months using measures of burnout, depression, anxiety, insomnia, well-being, and resilience, of which burnout (emotional exhaustion) and resilience were the primary outcomes. Two-tailed paired-sample t-tests were used to determine the significance of changes in outcome measures over time. RESULTS: In the three-month post-test, significant changes were found for both primary outcomes, emotional exhaustion (p = 0.001, Cohen's d effect size = -0.61) and resilience (p = 0.002, d = 0.53), as well as for anxiety (p < 0.001, d = -0.71), insomnia (p = 0.002, d = -0.53), depersonalization (p = 0.017, d = -0.40), depression (p = 0.006, d = -0.47), and mental wellbeing (p = 0.031, d = 0.36). TM practice compliance was high at 85%. Additionally, there were significant relationships between frequency of TM home practice and improvements in emotional exhaustion (p = 0.005), anxiety (p = 0.008), and insomnia (p < 0.001), and a marginally significant relationship with depression (p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that TM practice is an accessible, achievable, and effective intervention to decrease burnout and increase resilience for medical students. This study paves the way for future initiatives to evaluate a broad range of benefits of TM for medical students.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAUs) are the most prevalent form of painful oral mucosal disorder. Conventional treatment for RAUs involves the administration of tetracycline, which has been shown to alleviate clinical signs and symptoms. However, this medication has been associated with a number of adverse effects. Heartfulness meditation (HM) has been shown to facilitate natural healing of ulcers without complications by developing a compassionate connection with oneself. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of HM in the management of RAUs and to compare its effects with those of conventional treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A parallel study was conducted among 54 patients affected with RAUs. The patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1 - HM; group 2 - tetracycline treatment; and group 3 - combination of tetracycline treatment and HM. The evaluated outcomes included pain levels and the duration of ulceration. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test were applied to identify significant differences between the groups. RESULTS: A substantial decrease in pain intensity was observed during HM. The group that engaged in meditation alongside tetracycline treatment exhibited the lowest pain scores. At follow-up intervals of 3, 5 and 7 days, pain levels between the tetracycline group and the HM group were similar. The group that received a combination of tetracycline treatment and HM demonstrated the shortest duration of ulcers (7.167 ±0.383 days). CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that when HM was practiced in addition to tetracycline treatment, it demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing pain at the shortest time. Furthermore, the study noted a reduction in the duration of ulcers when HM was used in conjunction with tetracycline, as compared to the practice of HM alone."

This pilot study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 4-week, 8-session nature-mindfulness-compassion program using immersive virtual reality (Embodied-and-Embedded-Mindfulness-Compassion-Framework - Virtual-Reality (EEMCF-VR)) for older adults' mental health. METHODS: Following a mixed-methods, two-arm, open-label RCT design, 24 older adults (Mage = 75.1, SD = 6.58) were randomly assigned to EEMCF-VR (n = 12) or a psychoeducational pamphlet control group (n = 12). Participants completed self-report assessments of stress, positive and negative emotions, coping self-efficacy, psychosocial well-being, mindfulness, and nature connectedness at baseline (T1), midpoint (T2), post-intervention (T3), and 4-week follow-up (T4). Additionally, the EEMCF-VR group completed program feedback (T3) and simulator sickness (T1-T3) questionnaires. RESULTS: EEMCF-VR met feasibility benchmarks (recruitment targets achieved, attrition < 15%) and was well-tolerated (minimal simulator sickness). Participant feedback indicated high acceptability. The EEMCF-VR group reported significantly lower stress and negative emotions at T2 and T4 compared to controls. Qualitative analysis highlighted perceived benefits and components to retain (e.g. video content) or refine (e.g. headset weight). CONCLUSIONS: EEMCF-VR demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, with promising effects on stress and mood, warranting investigation in larger trials. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: EEMCF-VR shows potential as a scalable intervention to reduce older adults' emotional distress."

METHODS: Employing a combination of quantitative assessment and qualitative analysis, the study measured participants' emotional states, stress levels, and psychological resilience across multiple time points to track participants' mental health changes dynamically. In-depth interviews and analysis of meditation journals were also conducted. RESULTS: Yoga meditation significantly reduced anxiety, depression, and perceived stress while enhancing emotional regulation and self-awareness. Meditation positively influenced neuroplasticity, inducing beneficial changes in brain regions associated with emotional control and cognitive flexibility. Additionally, improved autonomic nervous system function was observed, with increased parasympathetic activity and reduced sympathetic response. Meditation strengthened psychological resilience in female college students, improved stress-coping strategies, and sustained positive mental health benefits even after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Yoga meditation is an effective mental health intervention, bolstering emotional regulation and reducing stress among female college students. Integrating yoga meditation into campus mental health programs is recommended to provide students with greater practice opportunities and personalized guidance."

Different contemplative practices reflect and express the underlying assumptions, guiding principles and goals of different traditions. How clinicians understand and relate to any contemplative practice will in turn influence how such practices influence the clinical encounter. Instrumental/Facilitative and \"Quietist\" assumptions and approaches to practice continue to exert an influence on the practitioner both consciously and unconsciously. The ensuing discussion describes and provides a review from a psychoanalytic perspective, the advantages and disadvantages of these different approaches to contemplative practice with a specific focus on shikantaza in relation to the psychoanalytic encounter."

BACKGROUND: Poor sleep quality exerts negative impact on life quality of old adults. The meditation-based mind-body interventions, with merits of simplicity, practicality, accessibility, and widespread dissemination, have been widely used to improve sleep in the older adults. However, the effects of MBIs on sleep quality of old adults are largely unknown. METHOD: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out following the PRISMA-P guidelines. Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI databases were searched to gather randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of MBIs on older adults with poor sleep quality. Study quality was evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: This study included 11 randomized controlled trials (with 1,052 participants) published between 2008 and 2023. Compared to the control group, there was a significant improvement in sleep quality (SMD= -0.66, 95%CI [-0.894, -0.426], P<0.00001), depression (SMD=-1.60, 95% CI [-1.89, 0.23], P=0.005), and anxiety (SMD= -1.46, 95% CI [-3.67, 0.75], P=0.026) for older adults with poor sleep quality. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the treatment effect for stress (SMD= -4.45, 95% CI [-10.24, 1.35], P=0.196). CONCLUSION: Meditation-based mind-body interventions significantly improved the sleep quality of older adults with poor sleep quality. Nevertheless, more evidence is needed to support this.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common reasons for medical visits. Patients with FD incur large direct and indirect expenditures and may have significant financial burdens that affect quality of life. Our study aimed to assess the effectiveness of meditation as an adjuvant to the standard treatment in individuals diagnosed with FD. This will explore more cost-effective therapeutic management in diseases like FD, which is believed to be related to the gut-brain axis. Meditation is a nonpharmacological therapy, safer and economical, and its adjuvant use can minimize or avoid the adverse effects of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). OBJECTIVES: We wanted to comprehensively assess the role of meditation as an adjuvant therapy in patients with FD and compare it with the control arm receiving standard treatment alone. The primary objective was the change in gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) score, and the secondary objective was to assess the changes in the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) score and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score before and after the intervention. METHODS: Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were divided equally into two arms (experimental and control groups). The experimental group received standard treatment for dyspepsia (PPI, domperidone, TCAs) and Vaishvanara Agni meditation (VAM), while the control group received standard treatment alone. Both groups were compared at weeks 0, 4, and 8 in terms of change in GIQLI score, HADS (HADS-A and HADS-D score), and PSQI score. RESULTS: Our study showed that both groups experienced significant changes in GIQLI, HADS-A, HADS-D, and PSQI scores at 4 and 8 weeks when compared with the baseline time point. However, when both groups were directly compared, it was observed that the experimental group exhibited notable variations in the GIQLI score after 8 weeks, the HADS-D score after 8 weeks, and the PSQI score after 4 weeks when contrasted with the control group. These differences were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: FD does not have an identified structural or biochemical cause, making it a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that requires a tailored treatment approach. Our pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated the impact of meditation as adjuvant therapy for FD, revealing improvements in GI health, mental well-being, and sleep quality compared to standard treatment alone. The study recommends incorporating meditation into the management of FD and similar conditions, highlighting its holistic nature that addresses not only specific symptoms but also overall well-being. This study pioneers the examination of meditation as a complementary approach for FD, offering promising results in improving GIQLI, HADS, and PSQI scores and thus adding value to preexisting literature.",

However, their effects on older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of loosening meditation, a brief and accessible practice we developed, on this population. Methods Nine older adults with MCI, defined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 21-28 during the screening period, participated in this pilot study. The sessions of our loosening meditation were conducted weekly over four weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the MMSE and the Revised Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS-R), while psychological well-being was evaluated with the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) and the Japanese version of the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology Mood Adjective Checklist (JUMACL). Serum levels of representative stress biomarkers were measured before and after the first meditation session. Results Participants had a mean age of 78.1 years (± 4.8 years) and a mean MMSE score of 25.1 points (± 2.5). These participants could complete all sessions safely. No significant differences were observed in MMSE, HDS-R, GHQ-30, or JUMACL (tension arousal) scores before and after the intervention. However, JUMACL (emotion arousal) scores significantly improved after the fourth session (pre-first, mean 25.3 ± 6.2; post-fourth, mean 28.7 ± 7.3; p = 0.004). Among these stress biomarkers, serum cortisol levels significantly decreased following the first session (before versus after, mean 10.8 ± 5.8 versus 7.4 ± 2.3 μg/dl; p = 0.04). Additionally, although not statistically significant, there was a trend towards a lower level of adrenaline after the first session (before versus after, mean 0.057 ± 0.026 versus 0.050 ± 0.027 ng/ml; p = 0.06). Conclusions Our loosening meditation was feasible, acceptable, and safe, and might enhance mood and reduce stress even in older adults with MCI. These preliminary findings suggest its potential as a supportive intervention for this population."

The benefits of long-term practice, such as increased self-compassion, greater cognitive and affective empathy, and prosocial behavior, are proposed to be due to neuroplastic changes that support well-being. This systematic review aims to summarize the differences in brain structure and function in long-term practitioners (LTPs) of LKM versus controls to identify possible underlying mechanisms that support mental health and drive treatment effect. METHODS: The literature search included Google Scholar, PubMed, and APA PsycINFO from inception through November 13, 2023. RESULTS: After review, five studies (64 LTPs and 67 controls total) were included. Brain regions with between-group differences reported in at least two studies include the superior parietal lobe, inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal lobe, and insular cortex. CONCLUSION: These areas are responsible for self-compassion, cognitive and affective empathy, and prosociality-personal qualities believed to be fostered through LKM practice. Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies incorporating LKM interventions for specific mental disorders are needed to further inform the biological basis of these treatments and may provide surrogate outcome measures for future clinical trials to refine this promising treatment modality.",

      "abstract": "Meditation interventions have important benefits, including potentially helping those with higher attachment anxiety and avoidance enjoy better personal and relational growth. This preregistered and reproducible systematic map sought to identify the extent and scope of experimental evidence investigating the role of mindfulness, loving-kindness, and compassion-based multi-session meditation interventions in (a) moderating the effects of attachment orientations on outcomes over time and/or (b) changing attachment orientations over time. We conducted a systematic map, as the literature on meditation interventions and attachment is nascent. We searched 5 databases, screening 725 studies. We extracted data from four journal articles and one dissertation (five studies in total) which met our inclusion criteria. Four studies examined the effects of meditation interventions on buffering attachment insecurity and one examined attachment security enhancement. All five studies included a mindfulness meditation intervention, and one included a loving-kindness meditation intervention. All studies were conducted in Western cultures. Studies primarily found evidence for interventions benefitting those with higher attachment anxiety, although some evidence emerged for higher attachment avoidance. Our systematic map highlights a critical need for further application of meditation interventions in an attachment and personal growth context, given the promising nature of early work in this area."

      "abstract": "Psychedelics have shown early evidence for a range of benefits and low harm profiles in extant research. However, adverse effects (AEs) research in psychedelics has been limited, leading to underspecified AE profiles, inconsistent measurement, and potential undercounting of AEs. The development of safe, effective psychedelic therapies and treatments for AEs when they occur requires a thorough assessment of psychedelic-related AEs, their phenomenology, risk factors, and longitudinal duration. This article proposes that research on meditation-related AEs, which overlap in important ways with the phenomenological and contextual characteristics of psychedelic-related AEs, has engaged many methodological challenges present in the study of psychedelic-related AEs. Thus, meditation-related AE research offers thematic and methodological insights that are valuable to psychedelic AE research. An integrative review of extant AE research in both psychedelics and meditation is provided, and an agenda for leveraging meditation research to advance the investigation of psychedelic AEs is recommended. This includes the utility of meditation-related AEs as a comparator condition for psychedelic-related AEs, as well as recommendations for the adoption of (1) detailed and comprehensive, (2) user-informed, (3) impact-based, (4) standardized, (5) unbiased, and (6) representative measures of AEs and (7) examining factors that influence their impacts and trajectories.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internalizing problems, such as worrying, anxiety and low mood, are increasingly common in youth and may constitute an early stage of mental illness development. There is thus an urgent need for effective measures to address mental health complaints as they develop and to prevent progression into more serious mental illness. Enhanced understanding of early-stage mental illness development, associated cognitive and brain processes, and their amenability to early intervention is crucial to this effort. Mindfulness-based interventions offer an accessible intervention option with demonstrated positive effects on internalizing disorders such as depression. Furthermore, mindfulness-based interventions may modulate cognitive processes and brain activity patterns associated with internalizing disorders. This study aims to determine how early-stage mindfulness-based intervention impacts internalizing symptom development, associated cognitive and brain processes, and mental illness progression in help-seeking youth. METHODS: This longitudinal two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 155 help-seeking youth between 16 and 25 years of age. The investigational treatment, the Learning to Offset Stress program, is an adaptation of existing mindfulness-based programs. Developed for youth with internalizing problems, the training combines mindfulness exercises with mindful physical activity and yoga in 8 weekly 2-hour sessions. Participants are randomized to either Learning to Offset Stress program as an add on to care-as-usual, or care-as-usual-only. Assessments take place at baseline, end of treatment, and 2 months and 6 months after completion of treatment. The primary outcome is the level of internalizing problems measured with the internalizing subscale of the Adult Self Report questionnaire at end of treatment. Secondary outcomes include measures of self-compassion, rumination, experiential avoidance, and well-being. In addition, (functional) magnetic resonance imaging and computerized cognitive tasks are conducted at baseline and at end of treatment. DISCUSSION: The current randomized controlled trial aims to enhance our understanding of the trajectory of emerging mental illness, associated cognitive and brain processes, and their modulation by early-stage mindfulness-based intervention.

With the rising prevalence of dementia and its profound impact on cognitive function and quality of life, this review aims to synthesize existing research and identify gaps in the literature. Methods: We systematically searched six electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus) from 2004 to 2024, yielding 462 potentially relevant articles. Screening was conducted using ASReview, an AI ranking tool, which facilitated the selection of studies. Ultimately, seven studies that met our stringent eligibility criteria were included in the review. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines for reporting. Results: Our findings indicate that mindfulness meditation significantly improves sleep quality, reduces insomnia severity, and enhances overall well-being in this at-risk population. Notably, interventions that combine structured, face-to-face sessions with at-home practice emerged as the most effective. Conclusions: Despite these positive outcomes, methodological limitations, including small sample sizes and reliance on self-reported measures, underscore the need for more rigorous long-term studies. This review highlights the potential of mindfulness meditation as a low-cost, scalable intervention to improve sleep and cognitive health in older adults, paving the way for future research and clinical applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals living with substance use disorder (SUD) often face unique challenges that can hinder their engagement in beneficial practices like meditation, which has been shown to support recovery and well-being. This study aimed to explore the perceived barriers to meditation with SUD, identify key obstacles, and inform future interventions that promote the adoption of a personal practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analytic study with a convenience sample of participants attending a treatment center for SUD. Data collected included demographics, SUD history, health challenges, meditation knowledge, and previous meditation practice. Barriers to meditation were evaluated using the Determinants of Meditation Practice Inventory (DMPI) and its revised version, DMPI-R. Overall frequencies, proportions, and measures of central tendency were calculated. Participants currently practicing meditation were compared to those not meditating by using Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen individuals completed the survey. Survey respondents were an average of 45 years (standard deviation, SD, 11.46), majority female (67.0 %), and White (90.3 %). Only 28.7 % of respondents were informed of meditation by their healthcare provider, yet 81.7 % were interested in learning about meditation. Among survey respondents, \"prayer is my form of meditation,\" followed by \"I can't stop my thoughts,\" were most agreed upon. CONCLUSION: Individuals living with SUD are interested in education on meditation techniques; however, additional research is needed to understand the determinants of meditation practice and discern the barriers that could help facilitate the adoption and long-term practice of this method.",

Content Validity Ratio (CVR), Average Congruency Percentage (ACP), and Content Validity Index were calculated. The intervention was given for 5 days a week for 4 weeks, to 9 PHP to check the feasibility and the efficacy of the module by analyzing biochemical and psychological parameters. A randomized controlled trial is planned ahead with this module as intervention. The designed meditation module had 19 concepts with CVR >0.49 and ACP > 90% which were retained, 2 were modified (CVR 0.6, ACP 80) and 1 was deleted as CVR was <0.49 and ACP < 70%. The feasibility test mean was 93.33 ± 8.66 and the efficacy was tested by increase in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (p = 0.022) and decrease in anxiety (p = 0.022) and perceived stress (p = 0.016), improvement in emotional quotient (p = 0.011), mental state (p = 0.044), quality of sleep (p = 0.001), quality of life (p = 0.011), and happiness state (p = 0.003). The designed meditation module was found valid by the experts, feasible to patients, and efficient in improving biochemical and psychological parameters among PHP to affect the hypertensive etiological factors and check the progress and complications of the disorder.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A recent trial found that Transcendental Meditation (TM) was an effective non-trauma focused treatment for veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The objective of this analysis was to examine the cost-effectiveness of TM for PTSD based on the trial results. METHODS: Between 2013-2017, 203 veterans with PTSD were randomized to either TM, Prolonged Exposure (PE), or to a PTSD health education (HE) control. Each group received 12 treatment sessions over 12 weeks. Results indicated that TM was non-inferior to PE for improving PTSD outcomes and both TM and PE were superior to HE, as hypothesized. The proportion of participants with a clinically significant improvement on the CAPS (≥10 point reduction) were TM = 61%, PE = 42%, and HE = 32%. A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of TM, using the trial effectiveness data. Intervention costs, health care costs, and health utility values associated with response and non-response were derived from scientific literature. Costs were viewed from an organizational perspective and a 5-year time horizon (20 3-month cycles). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: TM was the dominant treatment strategy over both PE and HE in the cost-effectiveness analysis. TM cost an estimated $1504/12 sessions while PE and HE cost $2,822 and $492, respectively. The higher health care costs associated with non-response to therapy offset intervention cost differences. Findings were robust to variability. CONCLUSION: In summary, using data from a recent RCT, TM was found to both improve health outcomes and reduce total costs in this analysis. Based on these results, further effectiveness trials and wider adoption of TM should be considered.",

Despite being presented as separate treatment modalities, mind-body approaches often use overlapping treatment aspects with the same mechanism of action. There is evidence that yoga, meditation, and hypnotherapy may partly draw their benefit from creating an absorbed state of attention combined with suggestions for change.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of digital meditation vs a waiting list condition on general and work-specific stress and whether greater engagement in the intervention moderates these effects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial included a volunteer sample of adults (aged ≥18 years) employed at a large academic medical center who reported mild to moderate stress, had regular access to a web-connected device, and were fluent in English. Exclusion criteria included being a regular meditator. Participants were recruited from May 16, 2018, through September 28, 2019, and completed baseline, 8-week, and 4-month measures assessing stress, job strain, burnout, work engagement, mindfulness, depression, and anxiety. Data were analyzed from March 2023 to October 2024. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized 1:1 to a digital meditation program or the waiting list control condition. Participants in the intervention group were instructed to complete 10 minutes of meditation per day for 8 weeks. The control group was instructed to continue their normal activities and not add any meditation during the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score at 8 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included changes in job strain, measured as work effort-reward imbalance. RESULTS: A total of 1458 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.54 [10.30] years; 1178 [80.80%] female) were included. Those randomized to meditation (n = 728) vs waiting list (n = 730) showed improvements in PSS (Cohen d, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96) and in all secondary outcome measures (eg, job strain: Cohen d, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23-0.46) at 8 weeks. These improvements were maintained at 4 months after randomization (PSS: Cohen d, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.84; job strain: Cohen d, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.50). Those using the app from 5 to 9.9 min/d vs less than 5 min/d showed greater reduction in stress (mean PSS score difference, -6.58; 95% CI, -7.44 to -5.73). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that a brief, digital mindfulness-based program is an easily accessible and scalable method for reducing perceptions of stress. Future work should seek to clarify mechanisms by which such interventions contribute to improvements in work-specific well-being. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03527303.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death, and psychosocial stress is considered a contributing factor to these issues. With the rising number of heart surgeries, proper rehabilitation post-surgery is essential. Previous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of yoga and transcendental meditation on the cardiovascular system. This pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of yoga and transcendental meditation on retinal microcirculation in cardiac patients before (admission), after (discharge), and following (3 weeks after discharge) rehabilitation. Methods: This study examined changes in retinal microcirculation in three rehabilitation groups of patients after heart surgery. The control group received standard exercise therapy, while the meditation group incorporated 20 min of meditation, and the yoga group incorporated 20 min of yoga practice, twice per day for the duration of four weeks of rehabilitation. Retinal images were captured using a non-mydriatic digital retinal camera (Canon CR-2, Canon Medical Systems Europe B.V., Netherlands), and the microcirculation parameters central retinal artery equivalent, central retinal vein equivalent, and artery-to-vein ratio were analyzed using MONA REVA software ((version 2.1.1), VITO, Mol, Belgium). Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to evaluate differences between the three groups in the course of rehabilitation. Results: None of the parameters revealed significant differences in retinal microcirculation between the three rehabilitation groups. Conclusions: The study evaluating changes in retinal microcirculation, as an indicator of central circulation in cardiac patients undergoing rehabilitation, did not observe any significant changes. As yoga and meditation are underestimated approaches in cardiac rehabilitation, this pilot study acts as a basis for providing preliminary information for future studies to encourage the research community to fill the gap in this area."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgical interventions are commonly utilized in the treatment of breast cancer; however, they can elicit adverse effects on women's perceptions of femininity, leading to stress, negative body image, diminished self-esteem, and challenges in sexual adjustment. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the efficacy of mindfulness-based meditation and yoga in alleviating stress, enhancing self-esteem, improving body image, and facilitating sexual adjustment among women undergoing modified radical mastectomy. METHODS: Using a prospective (pretest, posttest, and second-month follow-up), 2-arm (1:1), randomized controlled experimental design, the study involved 39 women (intervention group = 19, control group = 20) undergoing modified radical mastectomy. The intervention group participated in face-to-face mindfulness-based meditation and yoga sessions lasting approximately 90 minutes each over an 8-week period. RESULTS: Following the intervention, significant reductions in perceived stress and the significance attributed to breasts in sexuality were observed ( P < .05), accompanied by increases in self-esteem and body perception ( P < .05). However, no significant differences were observed in sexual adjustment ( P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based meditation and yoga interventions demonstrated efficacy in mitigating perceived stress, enhancing self-esteem, and improving body perception among women undergoing modified radical mastectomy. The findings advocate for the integration of mindfulness-based stress reduction programs, particularly during the preoperative phase, to support oncological patients, particularly those with breast cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Psychosocial aspects such as body image, self-esteem, and sexual adjustment following radical mastectomy are frequently overlooked in clinical care. This research highlights the potential benefits of incorporating mindfulness-based yoga and meditation techniques into nursing interventions to alleviate stress and enhance body confidence among women undergoing mastectomy.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition worldwide. The limited effectiveness of current psychological and pharmacological treatments has motivated studies on meditation techniques. This study is a comprehensive, multiple-treatments meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of different categories of meditation in treating PTSD. Methods and Materials: We followed Prisma guidelines in our published protocol to search major databases and to conduct a meta-analysis of the studies. Results: We located 61 studies with 3440 subjects and divided them logically into four treatment groups: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR, 13 studies); Mindfulness-Based Other techniques (MBO, 16 studies), Transcendental Meditation (TM, 18 studies), and Other Meditations that were neither mindfulness nor TM (OM, 14 studies). Trauma populations included war veterans, war refugees, earthquake and tsunami victims, female survivors of interpersonal violence, clinical nurses, male and female prison inmates, and traumatized students. Of those offered, 86% were willing to try meditation. The baseline characteristics of subjects were similar across meditation categories: mean age = 52.2 years, range 29-75; sample size = 55.4, range 5-249; % males = 65.1%, range 0-100; and maximum study duration = 13.2 weeks, range 1-48. There were no significant differences between treatment categories on strength of research design nor evidence of publication bias. The pooled mean effect sizes in Hedges's g for the four categories were MBSR = -0.52, MBO = -0.66, OM = -0.63, and TM = -1.13. There were no appreciable differences in the study characteristics of research conducted on different meditations in terms of the types of study populations included, outcome measures, control conditions, gender, or length of time between the intervention and assessment of PTSD. TM's effect was significantly larger than for each of the other categories, which did not differ from each other. No study reported serious side effects. Conclusions: All categories of meditation studied were helpful in mitigating symptoms of PTSD. TM produced clinically significant reductions in PTSD in all trauma groups. We recommend a multisite Phase 3 clinical trial to test TM's efficacy compared with standard treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether yoga and meditation added to usual care improves treatment response in women with interstitial cystitis-bladder pain syndrome. METHODS: This randomized trial compared women with interstitial cystitis-bladder pain syndrome receiving standard care alone (control group) with those receiving standard care plus meditation and yoga (mind-body group). Standard care was defined as behavioral changes or medications recommended by the American Urological Association. Individuals in the control group received standard care, and those in the mind-body group received standard care augmented with a commercially available meditation application and standardized yoga tutorial video. Both groups continued their current interstitial cystitis-bladder pain syndrome standard care treatments. The primary outcome was the modified GRA (Global Response Assessment), comparing responders (moderately, markedly improved) with nonresponders at 12 weeks. On power analysis assuming α=5% and β=80%, a sample size of 82 participants was required to find 30% difference on the GRA between groups. Weekly GRA scores over 12 weeks were also compared. Secondary outcomes included ICPI (Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index)/ICSI (Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index), pain, pain interference, anxiety/depression, and self-efficacy scores and treatment escalation over 12 weeks. RESULTS: Among 97 randomized participants (49 mind-body group, 48 control group), groups did not differ in characteristics or symptoms at baseline. The mind-body group had more GRA responders compared with the control group at 12 weeks (31/43 [72.1%] vs 10/39 [25.6%], relative risk [RR] 2.8, 95% CI, 1.6-4.6), corroborated by superior weekly GRA results over 12 weeks. The mind-body group had superior beneficial change on the ICPI (RR 1.8, 95% CI, 0.5-3.1), ICSI (RR 1.9, 95% CI, 0.2-3.6), and pain (RR 1.4, 95% CI, 0.4-2.5) scores than the control group at 12 weeks. The mind-body group required less treatment escalation than the control group (2/45 [4.4%] vs 14/42 [33.3%], RR 0.13, 95% CI, 0.03-0.55). CONCLUSION: The addition of meditation and yoga to standard interstitial cystitis-bladder pain syndrome care was associated with improved treatment response and required fewer additional interventions compared with standard care alone.

Thus, this study examined mindfulness meditation effect on pro-inflammatory biomarkers and C-reactive protein in patients with end-stage renal disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeated measures, randomized, control experimental design was used. A convenience sampling technique was used to select the sample from a hospital located in northern Jordan. The participants were randomly distributed into experimental (n = 31) and control (n = 31) groups. During hemodialysis sessions, the group of experiment participants practiced 30 min of the Attentional behavioral cognitive theory version of mindfulness meditation; 3 times a week for 8 weeks). The inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukine-6 were measured by collecting peripheral blood through venipuncture. These biomarkers were analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol after 5 weeks of the intervention, and at its end (8 weeks). An Excel sheet was used to collect data for participants. RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, mindfulness meditation led to statistically significant reductions in C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor over time but a nonsignificant effect on interleukine-6. CONCLUSION: Study's results support the evidence-based practice recommendation of adding mindfulness meditation as a complementary treatment to the nurse's care plans for patients with end-stage renal disease.

To help and alleviate these traumatic stress, we developed an evidence-based mobile application (app) for easy accessibility. This study aimed to test the effects of the mobile app for traumatic stress management using neurofeedback-based meditation and binaural beat music. METHOD: Fifty-eight participants were enrolled in a pilot randomized controlled trial (Trial Registration Number: KCT007724) consisting of two groups: (a) experimental group (n = 28) and (b) control group (n = 30). Participants used the mobile app 3 days a week at home for 4 weeks, engaging in neurofeedback-based meditation and binaural beat music. Participants completed self-report measures (SCL-47-R, Psychological Well-Being Post-traumatic Changes questionnaire) and EEG test (emotional stability, anti-stress) at a pretreatment and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in psychological well-being (F = 16.37, p < 0.001), emotional stability (F = 10.38; p = 0.002), and the anti-stress index (F = 11.37; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot trial, involving a neurofeedback-based meditation and binaural beat-centered music intervention, provide preliminary support and a readily accessible option for individuals seeking to recover from the effects of traumatic events. Additionally, we have established the groundwork for subsequent research to study the efficacy of a neurofeedback-based meditation program and a binaural beat-centered music intervention for those who have experienced traumatic events."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy can promote the 5-year overall survival rate of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients to 16%-21%. However, the negative emotions of patients, such as anxiety, are usually omitted. Moreover, their disease burden concentrates on pain symptoms, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients. How to improve the negative emotions of PC patients, alleviate their pain, and ameliorate their quality of life has become an urgent issue. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of mindfulness meditation (MM) combined with the BrainLink intelligent biofeedback instrument on the anxiety, pain, brain fatigue, and quality of life of PC patients under chemotherapy. METHOD: A total of 145 PC patients under chemotherapy were admitted to the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Army Military Medical University from January 2022 to March 2024 and were incorporated as study objects. They were divided into a control group (n = 72) and a test group (n = 73) according to the random number table. The control group received routine nursing treatment; the experimental group was treated with MM combined with an intelligent biofeedback instrument. The general information, anxiety (SAS), pain (VAS), EEG signal data (degrees of fatigue, concentration, and relaxation and EEG waves), and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) of the two groups before intervention and 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after intervention were compared. RESULT: There is no significant difference in baseline data and pathological features between the two groups. After the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the SAS values of the experimental group are remarkably lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the VAS scores of the experimental group are apparently lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of intervention, the score of the quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) in the experimental group is significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks, compared with the control group, the experimental group patients showed significant improvement in brain fatigue relief, concentration, and relaxation levels (p < 0.05), while the experimental group's brain α and θ. The wave showed an upward trend (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MM combined with the BrainLink intelligent biofeedback instrument can significantly mitigate the anxiety, pain severity, and brain fatigue relief degree of PC patients under chemotherapy, thereby promoting their quality of life. It provides a novel intervention for the psychosomatic health of PC patients under chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Objectives  Insufficient sleep leads to several short- and long-term physical and mental consequences. Yoga is a popularly known complementary health approach that maintains physical and mental health through asanas, meditation, and breathing techniques. Cyclic meditation (CM), derived from one of the Upanishads, is practiced by combining physical postures (asanas) with relaxation techniques. Recent findings emphasize the significance of CM as a means to enhance sleep quality. The current review aims to find the effects of CM on sleep quality through the available scientific data. Methods  The current review includes research articles evaluating CM's effect on sleep quality from various databases such as PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar up to January 22, 2023. We conducted a literature search using keywords related to CM and sleep quality, and search results were restricted to studies published in the English language. Results  There were 5 articles with 277 participants meeting inclusion criteria, all conducted in India. Of those, 2 were randomized controlled trials and 3 were single-group or two-group pre-post and crossover studies. Participants ranged from healthy volunteers, type-2 diabetic patients, alcohol dependents, and caregivers for special needs children. Based on the available scientific evidence, CM has been found to be effective ( d =  0.56-4.90) in enhancing the quality of sleep. Conclusion  The CM technique could be tentatively considered as a beneficial practice to improve sleep. However, further, adequately powered, and randomized controlled studies with various other parameters of sleep are required to strongly recommend CM as a stand-alone yogic intervention for sleep disturbance."

Currently, treatments for infertility are receiving more attention, but emotional support is equally important. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of meditation, exercises, dietary, and life-style modifications on depression, anxiety, stress, and self-esteem among infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was carried out on randomly assigned 60 infertile women (30 experimental and 30 control groups) with the above-mentioned distress at the Infertility Clinic of a tertiary-level hospital in India during the period from 01.07.2020 to 30.6.2021. Infertile women were enrolled using a systematic random sampling technique. The pretest was done with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale. Interventions were operated on an experimental group for five subsequent visits for 60 minutes and the control group received routine care. A post-test was done on sixth visit. RESULTS: The pretest mean score of infertile women was 16.13 ± 4.95 for depression, 18.93 ± 4.26 for anxiety, 29.27 ± 4.59 for stress and 10.47 ± 3.49 for self-esteem, respectively. The post-test mean score was 9.07 ± 3.14 for depression, 10.73 ± 3.17 for anxiety, 18.4 ± 3.77 for stress, and 17.5 ± 1.96 for self-esteem. The study results showed the post-test mean score was significantly different in the experimental and control groups at P < 0.001. CONCLUSION: These complementary therapies could potentially lessen the emotional distress experienced by infertile women and boost pregnancy rates. So, infertility management should be comprehensive instead of only using medical treatment to get a better outcome."

      "abstract": "Meditation retreats are structured programs that immerse participants in focused meditation, mindfulness, and self-reflection over extended periods. Unlike conventional vacations, which prioritize relaxation, meditation retreats combine intensive practice with intentional rest, cultivating emotional regulation, mindfulness, and personal growth. These retreats have grown in popularity for their ability to support mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Research shows that retreats can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression while enhancing emotional resilience. Physical benefits, including reduced inflammatory markers and improved metabolic health, further contribute to long-term well-being. Positioned within the expanding wellness tourism market, meditation retreats offer sustainable benefits that surpass those of traditional leisure activities, marking them as a promising tool in preventive healthcare. In this editorial, we examine the evidence supporting these benefits and discuss challenges, such as varied formats, limited follow-up, and accessibility issues, which limit broader application. Further research is essential to standardise protocols, evaluate cost-effectiveness, and expand access, underscoring the potential of meditation retreats as a sustainable well-being intervention in today's demanding world."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of mindfulness meditation (MM) for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is unknown and needs to be updated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of MM for the treatment of FMS. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive search of relevant studies published from the databases' inception through April 12, 2023 was conducted within the following databases: Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Clinicaltrials.gov, and PsycINFO. We included randomized controlled trials that reported at least one of the following outcome indicators: the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results are presented in terms of mean difference (MD), supplemented by 95% CIs The I2 statistic assessed heterogeneity across 3 distinct observational time frames. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to appraise the robustness of the evidence. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials were selected from 1,377 citations (n = 818). Various MM regimens were reported (type of mindfulness, duration, schemes, and ingredients). Among 818 patients, very low to moderate evidence indicated that MM could reduce FIQ in the short-term (MD = -6.20; 95% CI,-8.51 to -3.89; P < 0.05; GRADE: moderate); a lower PSQI score (MD = -1.84; 95% CI, -3.35 to -0.33; P < 0.05; GRADE: very low); a reduce BDI score (MD = -3.26; 95% CI, -5.77 to -0.76; P < 0.05; GRADE: moderate); and a decreased PSS score (MD = -4.85; 95% CI, -8.22 to -1.49; P < 0.05; GRADE: very low). At medium-term follow-up, MM consistently reduced the BDI score (MD = -2.88; 95% CI, -4.98 to -0.79; P < 0.05; GRADE: moderate) and decreased the PSS score (MD = -2.76; 95% CI, -4.82 to -0.70; P < 0.05; GRADE: moderate) but there was no significant difference in FIQ scores (MD = -2.78; 95% CI, -6.32 to 0.76; P > 0.05; GRADE: low) and PSQI scores (MD = -1.28; 95% CI, -3.35 to -0.80; P > 0.05; GRADE: very low). However, at long-term follow-up, MM still reduced FIQ scores (MD = -6.09; 95% CI, -9.01 to -3.16; P < 0.05; GRADE: moderate). LIMITATIONS: The relatively small sample size and the average quality of the included studies may have introduced biases. The time and method of meditation in the included studies were not completely unified, and there were confounding factors. Additionally, the limited amount of available literature is a challenge. Despite focusing on randomized controlled trials, there is heterogeneity among these studies. Future research should aim for larger, higher-quality studies to address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive understanding of MM's effectiveness in fibromyalgia management. CONCLUSIONS: Very low to moderate evidence shows that MM improves quality of life, relieves stress, and relieves insomnia and depression in patients with FMS in the short-term. Notably, the improvement in depression and stress levels continued into the medium-term period. Furthermore, quality of life improvement was discernible at long-term follow-up. This suggests that MM can be used as an adjunct therapy for FMS.International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) Registration Number: CRD42023442356.",

Developing interventions to promote healthy aging by preserving telomere integrity is of paramount importance. Here, we investigated the effect of an 18-month meditation intervention on telomere length (TL) measures in older people without cognitive impairment. METHODS: A total of 137 adults age ≥65 years were randomized to one of the 3 groups (meditation training, non-native language training, or passive control). We evaluated the 50th and 20th percentile TL and the percentage of critically short telomeres (<3 kbp) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Mixed model analysis showed a time effect indicating a general decrease on the 50th percentile TL (F = 80.72, p adjusted < .001), without a significant group effect or time × group interaction. No significant effect was detected in the 20th percentile TL or the percentage of critically short telomeres. Secondary analysis showed that only in the meditation training group 1) the 50th percentile TL positively correlated with class attendance time (r = 0.45, p adjusted < .011), 2) the 50th and 20th percentile TL positively correlated with responsiveness to the intervention, evaluated through a composite score (r = 0.46, p adjusted < .010 and r = 0.41, p adjusted = .029, respectively), and 3) lower scores on a measure of the personality trait \"openness to experience\" correlated with a lower percentage of critically short telomeres after the intervention (r = 0.44, p adjusted = .015). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, we found no evidence for a main effect of an 18-month meditation training program on TL compared with the control groups. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of moderating factors when measuring the effectiveness of meditation-based trainings."

MATERIAL AND METHODS We randomly allocated 78 participants to either the experimental group (n=39) or the control group (n=39). The control group received perioperative nursing, while the experimental group engaged in a daily mindfulness meditation practice from the second day of admission until the fifth day after surgery, excluding the day of surgery. The pre- and post-intervention physiological stress levels of serum cortisol, blood pressure, and heart rate were assessed. The State Anxiety Inventory Scale (SAI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) were utilized to measure psychological stress. The rehabilitation and additional indices were also observed. RESULTS The serum cortisol and SAI in both groups showed an increasing trend on the 3rd day after surgery, followed by a decreasing trend. On the 5th day after surgery, significant reductions were observed in cortisol (t=-2.054, P=0.043) and VAS (t=-2.29, P=0.025). The experimental group exhibited lower levels of cortisol and SAI compared to the control group, while the FFMQ score gradually increased with intervention. Additionally, the experimental group demonstrated significantly shortened hospital stays (t=-3.157, P=0.002) and reduced requirements for postoperative analgesics. CONCLUSIONS Perioperative short-term mindfulness meditation can improve the mindfulness ability of patients with gastrointestinal tumors, relieve anxiety and tension, reduce serum cortisol, regulate blood pressure and heart rate, generally reduce perioperative psychological and physiological stress responses, and control hospital time and cost.",

      "abstract": "There is a renewed interest in taking phenomenology seriously in consciousness research, contemporary psychiatry, and neurocomputation. The neurophenomenology research program, pioneered by Varela, rigorously examines subjective experience using first-person methodologies, inspired by phenomenology and contemplative practices. This review explores recent advancements in neurophenomenological approaches, particularly their application to meditation practices and potential clinical research translations. First, we examine innovative multidimensional phenomenological assessment tools designed to capture subtle, dynamic shifts in experiential content and structures of consciousness during meditation. These experience sampling approaches enable shedding new light on the mechanisms and dynamic trajectories of meditation practice and retreat. Second, we highlight how empirical studies in neurophenomenology leverage the expertise of experienced meditators to deconstruct aversive and self-related processes, providing detailed first-person reports that guide researchers in identifying novel behavioral and neurodynamic markers associated with pain regulation, self-dissolution, and acceptance of mortality. Finally, we discuss a recent framework, deep computational neurophenomenology, that updates the theoretical ambitions of neurophenomenology to naturalize phenomenology. This framework uses the formalism of deep parametric active inference, where parametric depth refers to a property of generative models that can form beliefs about the parameters of their own modeling process. Collectively, these methodological innovations, centered around rigorous first-person investigation, highlight the potential of epistemologically beneficial mutual constraints among phenomenological, computational, and neurophysiological domains. This could contribute to an integrated understanding of the biological basis of mental illness, its treatment, and its tight connections to the lived experience of the patient.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors represent an important health issue in older adults. Previous findings suggest that meditation training could have a positive impact on these risk factors. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of an 18-month meditation-based intervention on cardiovascular health. METHODS: Age-Well was a randomized, controlled superiority trial with blinded end point assessment, including community-dwelling cognitively unimpaired adults 65 years and older enrolled between November 24, 2016, and March 5, 2018, in France. One hundred and thirty-four participants were included in this secondary analysis. Participants were randomly affected to an intervention group that received an 18-month meditation-based program or to comparison groups (active control group i.e. non-native language training or passive control group i.e. no intervention). The main outcome was change in the Framingham Risk Score (FRS); other outcomes were changes in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. RESULTS: There was no difference in FRS change after 18 months between trial arms (p = .38). When assessing individual cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors, meditation training was associated with a greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure than the comparison group in participants with intermediate to high cardiovascular risk (FRS > 10%) at baseline (p = .03). CONCLUSION: An 18-month meditation training was not effective to increase overall cardiovascular health in older adults, but improved diastolic blood pressure in a subgroup analysis including at-risk participants. These results suggest a potential benefit of a long-term meditation intervention in older adults at-risk of cardiovascular diseases, and highlights the need for future research in more targeted populations.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mind-wandering is a pervasive human brain state and, when in excess, may promote negative affect and neuropsychiatric conditions. Mindfulness meditation may promote alternate brain states, improving affect and reducing stress. An understanding of the neural basis between these brain states could thus advance treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions, including those associated with epilepsy. METHODS: To explore the neural basis of mindfulness meditation versus mind-wandering, we enrolled eight patients in a trial of structured mindfulness meditation and open mind-wandering who underwent stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) within the mesial temporal lobe for seizure localization. Electrophysiology was compared between mind-wandering and mindfulness separately for epileptic and non-epileptic MTL. Using fitting-one-over-f modeling, periodic components of electrophysiology were compared in canonical frequency bands of theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-55 Hz). Aperiodic components of the power spectra were assessed by the model offset, knee, and exponent. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in gamma power (30-55 Hz) within the mesial temporal lobe (MTL) during mindfulness meditation compared with mind-wandering in non-epileptic (p = 1.20E-4) but not in epileptic MTL (p = 0.352).There was also a significant difference between epileptic versus non-epileptic MTL in gamma power between conditions (p = 0.011). There were no significant changes in power across any frequency band within epileptic mesial temporal MTL between brain states. Conversely, there were significant differences between mind-wandering and mindfulness within epileptic MTL in aperiodic components (offset, knee, and exponent, all p < 0.05), while no differences in aperiodic components were seen in non-epileptic MTL (all p > 0.70). SIGNIFICANCE: Intracranial electrophysiologic modulations between brain state (mind-wandering versus mindfulness) may differ between epileptic and non-epileptic MTL. Modulations in gamma activity in non-epileptic MTL may represent functional changes in brain state, while aperiodic changes in epileptic MTL may modulate propensity for seizures.",

METHODS: This study was a randomised controlled trial. A total of 72 patients with stroke with concurrent coronary heart disease were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, with 36 patients in each group. The control group received routine treatment plus eszopiclone tablets at a dosage of 3 mg once daily. The observation group received mindfulness meditation in addition to the treatment given to the control group. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep status, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale were used to assess depression and anxiety, and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment was used to assess motor function. All participants in both groups received a 6-week intervention. RESULTS: Pairwise comparisons revealed that the observation group had better outcomes in sleep quality, sleep onset latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, daytime function and total scores at both 6 and 12 weeks compared with the control group (p < 0.05). After 12 weeks of intervention, compared with the control group, the total score of sleep quality improved more significantly (9.22 ± 2.35/6.26 ± 2.47). Additionally, different treatment methods had varying effects on anxiety scores, depression scores and motor function scores between the two groups (p < 0.001). Further comparisons showed that the observation group had lower anxiety and depression scores and higher motor function scores at both 6 and 12 weeks compared with the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness meditation can effectively improve sleep quality and reduce negative emotions in patients with stroke with concurrent coronary heart disease, as well as promote the recovery of limb functions.",

While technology based MBCT is a standardized cost-effective approach, there have been concerns about its feasibility and effectiveness in clinical settings. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the longitudinal relationship between improved emotional regulation resulting from participation in Immersive Virtual Reality Meditation (IVRM) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) as monitored by electrocardiogram. METHODS: This study was a longitudinal single-arm clinical trial in which the intervention was conducted three times a week for 10 weeks at a behavioral health unit in a community hospital (n = 26). We measured Coherence Achievement Score (CAS), depression, and anxiety. The relationships between CAS, anxiety, depression, and covariates were analyzed using a Generalized Estimated Equation (GEE). RESULTS: The findings of our study provide evidence that the CAS scores indicative of emotional regulation function after IVRM participation were associated with a reduction in depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: Among the many technology-based complementary health care interventions that are available to reduce depression and anxiety, IVRM program use increases emotional regulatory function and decrease depression and anxiety."

A mixed repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to analyze interaction effects, within-group differences, and between-group differences. The experimental group demonstrated greater improvement compared to the control group across several measures: (1) reaction time in the 1-back task, (2) correct responses in the no-go condition of the go/no-go task, and (3) percentage of correct responses, errors, perseverative errors, non-perseverative errors, perseverative responses, and conceptual level responses in the WCST (p < 0.001). These findings underscore the potential benefits of an 8-week school-based meditation program incorporating chanting and meditation for enhancing EFs in school-age children."

We investigated individual-level variables associated with self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness to longer-term meditation training. This study presents a secondary analysis of the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819, 30/11/2016) and includes 90 healthy older adults (65-84 years) that were randomised to an 18-month meditation training or a non-native language (English) training. Responsiveness was measured post-intervention using participants' and teachers' ratings of four psychological domains (connection, positive/negative emotions, meta-awareness) in relation to two contexts (during sessions, in daily life), teachers' perception of overall benefit, and a global composite comprising all self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness measures. Linear regression modelling indicates that, when including baseline variables (sex, education, neuroticism, cognition, expectancy) and engagement (hours of formal practice during intervention), only higher levels of engagement were associated with higher global composite scores (standardised estimate = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.24-0.77, p < 0.001). Global composite scores were not correlated with pre-post changes in well-being. Findings indicate that more time spent practising meditation was related to greater perceived intervention effects. We suggest that future studies closely monitor levels of engagement and map reasons for disengagement.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) results in discomfort in youth. This study proposes that yoga and mindfulness will decrease anxiety and improve the quality of life in IBS youth. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE AND INTERVENTION: To measure the impact of a virtual 6-week Standardized Yoga and Meditation Program for Stress Reduction (SYMPro-SR) program on anxiety, symptoms, and quality of life. METHODS/DESIGN: Participants completed 3 surveys over the phone before and after the yoga course. A minimum sample size of 45 subjects was calculated to detect a 20% difference in pre and post Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) scores, using 80% power, a two-tailed P value of .05, and a standard deviation SCARED total score of 10. Due to COVID-19, the study was converted into a pilot study with a goal of 10 recruited patients. Additional recruitment is ongoing. SETTING: Virtual. PARTICIPANTS: Youth aged 12-21 years with IBS in 2 pediatric gastroenterology offices in New Jersey. 40 subjects were approached, 10 were onboarded, and 8 completed the program. There were 4 female, 4 male, 6 white, 1 Asian, and 1 black participant(s). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: SCARED, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and Children Somatic Symptoms Inventory (CSSI) pre and post-yoga survey scores. RESULTS: Post-intervention, PedsQL showed improvement (P = .01). The SCARED anxiety subscale scores significantly decreased (P = .01). There was a trend for improved outcomes in SCARED panic disorder and separation anxiety subscale scores (P = .07 and .08, respectively). Four (sore muscles, stomach aches, feeling bloated or gassy, and food making one sick) of the 24 symptoms in the CSSI significantly improved post-intervention. CONCLUSION: Teenagers with IBS were able to complete the yoga videos at home, with demonstrated improvement in quality of life, certain aspects of anxiety, and some somatic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunctions and nonmotor symptoms. Current treatments do not alter disease progression, highlighting the need for alternative therapies. Music, dance, and mindfulness meditation have shown the potential to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with PD. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of dance or music and meditation on PD progression, cognitive functions, mood, behavior, and caregiver burden. METHODS: This study is a single-blinded, longitudinal, parallel, randomized controlled trial. The participants consist of 30 patients with mild to moderate PD residing in Mumbai, India, who can physically participate in the activities. The exclusion criteria include advanced PD, severe balance issues, age >80 years, and other movement disorders. Participants in the intervention group will engage in dance or music sessions and guided meditation thrice weekly for 6 months. The control group will continue their usual activities and medication. The primary outcome is the progression of PD symptoms, measured using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale I-III, and quality of life, measured using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39. The secondary outcomes include cognitive functions (Mini-Mental State Examination), mood (Beck Depression Inventory and Parkinson Anxiety Scale), mobility (timed up and go and Berg Balance Test), behavioral disorders (Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-Carer). RESULTS: Data collection was completed in February 2024, with 28 participants finishing the study (intervention group: n=15, 54% and control group: n=13, 46%). Data analysis is underway, with results expected to be published in December 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to provide significant insights into the effectiveness of dance or music and meditation in improving the quality of life and slowing the progression of PD. The findings are anticipated to support using these nonpharmaceutical therapies as complementary approaches to managing PD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CTRI/2023/03/051064; https://tinyurl.com/2xdus53j.

METHODS: This is a prospective, three-armed, randomized controlled trial with women undergoing ART cycle, age ranging from 18 to 50 years. In the day of embryo transfer, the patients randomized to Brief MI group received a 15-minute audio of mindfulness. They were instructed to practice it daily, starting from the day of embryo transfer to the day of the pregnancy test, leading to a total of 180-210 minutes. Women randomized to EBMI met once a week during the waiting time between the embryo transfer and pregnancy test day in the same virtual room with a meditator instructor for 40 minutes, totalizing two sessions (80 minutes). The pregnancy rate was assessed via a blood test to measure hCG performed 2 weeks after embryo transfer. RESULTS: A total of 68 women aged 37.5 ± 4.3y were included (EBMI, n = 24; Brief MI, n = 22 and CG, n = 22). Pearson's Chi-square test and Student's t-test for independent samples showed no significant differences between intervention and control groups. Both EBMI and Brief MI had no significant effect on pregnancy rate in women undergoing ART. CONCLUSION: This randomized control trial revealed that the extremely brief meditation (EBMI) or self-managed brief mindfulness intervention (Brief MI) had no significant effect on pregnancy rates in infertile women undergoing ART cycles.

For patients diagnosed with kidney failure, hemodialysis is the sole recourse until a suitable renal donor is acquired, exerting a discernible impact on the overall quality of life. Yoga and meditation emerge as pivotal elements in enhancing quality of life (QoL), significantly influencing diverse aspects of well-being. The study aimed to identify the effectiveness of yoga and meditation on QoL among hemodialysis patients. An experimental research design with one group pretest - post-test on 100 participants was conducted in Muljibhai Patel Urology Hospital, Nadiad. Pre-tests were conducted on day 1, followed by a 12-week yoga and meditation program with a post-test. Data analysis utilised SPSS-20 software, employing descriptive and inferential statistics. Yoga and meditation effectively demonstrated improvement in QoL in each domain (p < 0.001.) post-intervention. These results emphasize QoL enhancement after incorporating these practices into hemodialysis care."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Meditation apps are the most widely used mental health apps. The precise mechanisms underlying their effects remain unclear. In particular, the degree to which affect experienced during meditation is associated with outcomes has not been established. METHOD: We used the meditation app arm of a recently completed randomized controlled trial comparing a self-guided meditation app (Healthy Minds Program) to a waitlist control. Predominantly distressed public school employees (n = 243, 80.9% with clinically elevated depression and/or anxiety) reported positive and negative affect during meditation practice. Data were analyzed using two-level multivariate latent growth curve models (observations nested within participants) that simultaneously attended to both positive and negative affect. We examined whether positive and negative affect during meditation changed over time and whether these changes were associated with changes in psychological distress (parent trial's preregistered primary outcome) at posttest or 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: On average, participants reported decreased negative affect but no change in positive affect during meditation over time. Increased positive affect and decreased negative affect during meditation were associated with improvements in distress at posttest and follow-up. Change in positive affect was a stronger predictor of distress at follow-up than change in negative affect. CONCLUSIONS: Despite notions embedded within mainstream mindfulness meditation training that deemphasize the importance of the affective experience of practice (i.e., nonjudgmental awareness of present moment experience, regardless of valence), results indicate that these experiences contain signals associated with outcomes. Monitoring affect during meditation may be worthwhile to guide intervention delivery (i.e., measurement-based care, precision medicine).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The academic development and widespread adoption of meditation practices for well-being and therapy have predominantly focused on secularised adaptations of Buddhist and Hindu techniques. This study aims to expand the field by investigating Christian and Islamic meditation that emphasize the spiritual significance of the heart through elements of visualisation and recitation. It compares the effects of spiritual heart-centred meditation with mindfulness meditation and a waitlist control, focusing on dimensions of social functioning, psychophysiology, cognition, and mental health. METHOD: This study employs a stratified 3-arm randomised controlled method with mixed-method repeated measures across three assessment time points: before intervention (T1), after an 8-week intervention (T2), and at a 3-month follow up (T3). The three conditions include spiritual meditation (either Christian or Islamic), mindfulness meditation (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction - MBSR), and a waitlist. Participants will be stratified into Christian and Muslim samples and randomly allocated to the spiritual meditation, MBSR, or waitlist control conditions. Importantly, participants assigned to the spiritual meditation condition will be matched to the spiritual meditation program corresponding to their religion. The intervention will be administered through a mobile phone app with daily 20-minute guided meditation sessions for eight weeks. Primary outcomes pertain to the domain of interpersonal functioning, focusing on prosociality, forgiveness, empathy, and perspective taking. Secondary outcomes include physiology: pain tolerance, pain intensity, stress reactivity assessed via heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), psychophysiological reactivity associated with a forgiveness task as measured through HR and HRV, attention (alerting, orienting, and executive attention networks), and mental health (stress, depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, positive and negative affect). DISCUSSION: This trial aims to test the effects of an app-based Christian and Islamic meditation, compared to secular mindfulness and a waitlist, using a randomised controlled trial. If the results yield positive outcomes, this study will support the efficacy of these contemplations, offering practitioners a way to enhance their well-being within their religious framework.

Practice of anulom vilom pranayama and heartfulness meditation (AVPHFN) can improve mental and physical health and counter stress. The present study explored the effect of 8-week AVPHFN intervention on autonomic functions, emotional stress, oxidative stress, and inflammation markers in the nurse group of health-care givers. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial where 50 nurses underwent AVPHFN and 50 participated as controls. At baseline and after 8 week intervention of AVPHFN anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular parameters, autonomic function including time and frequency domain parameters, biochemical parameters, and psychological stress using the questionnaire were assessed. RESULTS: Forty nurses in AVPHFN group and 46 in control group completed the study. AVPHFN intervention resulted in a significant reduction in cardiovascular parameters heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and rate pressure product (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively), perceived stress score and depression, anxiety, and stress scale psychological variables of depression, and stress compared to the control group. Total power, ratio of low frequency to high frequency and change in successive normal sinus (NN) intervals exceeds 50 ms (p<0.01, p=0.05, and p<0.01 respectively) suggesting parasympathodominance due to higher vagal efferent activity. Serum cortisol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and telomerase significantly decreased in AVPHFN group post intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Eighty-week intervention of AVPHFN improved psychophysiological, autonomic and biochemistry profile of nurse group of health-care workers. AVPHFN module may be beneficial for curtailing stress and improving well-being.",

We conducted a review of the literature to examine meditation as a safe, effective, and low-cost alternative. METHODS: We searched PubMed and other journals using \"meditation,\" \"mindfulness,\" \"minority,\" related keywords, and relevant MeSH terms. Eligible studies involved racial/ethnic minorities in the USA, reported quantitative psychosocial outcomes, and were published in a peer-reviewed, English-language journal. RESULTS: Out of 119 \"hits,\" 111 were eliminated as duplicates or were not relevant. A full-text review of the remaining eight revealed that none fully met our eligibility criteria. Besides the obvious lack of studies, those reviewed reported incomplete demographic and clinical data. They also employed different and inconsistent research methodologies, interventions and modalities, and statistical analyses. This hindered understanding exactly which populations may benefit from meditation, and for which specific symptoms. CONCLUSION: We recommend a socio-ecological model in examining intervention modalities, especially in the context of intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, environmental, and policy domains. We also suggest the possible inclusion of research older than 10 years, conducted outside of the USA, on minority and non-minority populations, for supplementary and confirmatory data. We advocate for consistency in study design and data collection, which would help align research conducted in different countries. Searches should also include variations of meditation such as \"mindfulness\" and \"guided imagery,\" and associated symptoms and comorbidities of ADHD, including \"learning disorder\" and \"behavioral problems.\""

There has been a recent upsurge in non-pharmacological management involving mindfulness-based meditation (MBM) in lowering blood pressure (BP) among the hypertensive population; however, the level of supportive evidence among patients primarily diagnosed with hypertension remain limited. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of MBM on BP explicitly in adults primarily diagnosed with elevated blood pressure or hypertension. METHODS: A database search of RCTs was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science until December 2023. The effect size score was calculated for variables of interest followed by qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies with 543 participants (mean age 54.9±9.0) met the pre-specified eligibility criteria. Eight trials reported MBM convincing in lowering the systolic BP (p=0.001-0.020) and 6 in reducing the diastolic BP (p=0.001-0.01) among this target population. There was a disparity of gender in 7 studies and 4 trials did not report the ethnicity of participants. The methodological quality of the trials was gratifying, however, most studies presented with absence of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors, fragmentary reporting of data, and high attrition rate that potentially affected the validity of trials. CONCLUSION: MBM interventions may serve as an early preventive and supportive measure for adults with elevated BP or hypertension. However, more robust and rigorous trials with a larger, homogeneous sample and long-term follow-up are necessary to quantify the magnitude of this intervention. Moreover, the methodological issues may affect the overall quality and reliability of MBM interventions; hence, future studies must also address the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding and high attrition through treatment concealment and personalized engagement measures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this pilot study is to determine, in the context of a controlled intervention study, whether the health-promoting personal protective factors of sense of coherence, resilience, and self-compassion are strengthened by the practice of Metta meditation in individuals with cardiovascular disease. The interactions between mind and body play a pivotal role in health and mortality. Lifestyle factors and especially stress also play a decisive role in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. With health-promoting personal protective factors, which can be actively formed over the entire lifespan, stressors can be managed more adequately. METHODS: Data collection will be conducted as part of a controlled nonrandomized longitudinal pilot intervention study that will enrol individuals with cardiovascular disease (n=29). After the first interview, a 12-week Metta meditation course will start for the intervention group (IG) (n=9), while the control group (CG) (n=20) will receive no intervention. The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure® Questionnaire (MLHFQ), the 13-item Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13), the Resilience Scale, the Self-Compassion Scale short form (SCS-sf) German version, the German version of the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Stress Coping subscale of the Stress and Coping Inventory (SCI) are used at both measurement time (MT) points. In addition, blood pressure parameters are collected. Furthermore, selected literature will be consulted to integrate the evaluated data into existing research findings. RESULTS: The health-promoting personal competencies of sense of coherence, resilience, and self-compassion were not strengthened by the practice of Metta meditation in individuals with cardiovascular disease. However, there was a significant reduction in perceived stress {F[1, 27] =4.351, P=0.047, f=0.402} and improved stress coping skills {F[1, 26] =6.790, P=0.02, f=0.511} in the IG. Furthermore, the frequency of rehospitalization {F[1, 27] =5.607, P=0.03, f=0.456} differed significantly in the pre-post comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the insufficient size of the sample, the results are only exploratory in nature and should therefore only be considered preliminary. Also, the correlations between the significant changes in the parameters and Metta meditation cannot be finally assessed. For this purpose, further studies with larger samples are needed."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Self-compassion is a fundamental aspect of psychological health and well-being that can be cultivated through self-compassion meditations, but it remains unclear how to facilitate this most effectively. This study is the first to explore whether sensory and semantic priming introduced prior to a guided self-compassion meditation could enhance the effects of meditation in comparison with a control condition. METHODS: The study was conducted with 3 × 3 repeated measures between-group design, including three groups (sensory priming, semantic priming and control group), and three assessment time points of state self-compassion, self-criticism, and positive and negative affect (at baseline, after priming, and after guided meditation). Additionally, a meditation appeal questionnaire was used. The total sample size included 71 students who underwent a 3-min priming intervention followed by a 15-min self-compassion guided meditation session. RESULTS: First, prior to guided meditation, sensory priming significantly decreased state self-criticism more than the control condition or semantic priming, although some reliability issues of the applied self-criticism scale must be taken into consideration. Second, neither sensory nor semantic priming changed state self-compassion, positive affect or negative affect. Third, neither semantic nor sensory priming significantly enhanced the effects of guided self-compassion meditation either in positive and negative affect, self-compassion states, self-criticism states, or in the appeal of the meditation experience. DISCUSSION: Although this study is underpowered (estimated post hoc power ranges from 0.20 to 0.42), the findings provide preliminary insights into the potential priming has as a tool to enhance meditation effects and provide guidelines for future studies."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed the effectiveness of meditation in addressing fatigue, given its widespread use as a remedy for sleep disturbances and fatigue. METHOD: We analyzed 29 randomized controlled trials from MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, spanning from December 31, 2022. We conducted two metaanalyses using mean difference (MD) with normalized data and standardized mean difference (SMD) with original data. RESULTS: These trials included various populations, with baseline fatigue severity observed at 52.2 ± 16.0 points among 4104 participants. After an average meditation duration of 9.6 ± 4.7 weeks, fatigue scores decreased significantly by 6.4 points of MD [95% CI, 4.3-8.5] compared to controls. The most significant reduction occurred in the sub-healthy group (MD 8.2 [95% CI, 2.7 to 13.8]), followed by the general group (MD 6.9 [95% CI, 0.4 to 13.4]), and the disease group (MD 5.7 [95% CI, 3.4 to 8.0]). Notably, meditation-based anti-fatigue effects were particularly pronounced for mental fatigue (MD 10.0 [95% CI, 4.3 to 15.6]), especially with expert guidance and supplementary homework. CONCLUSION: These findings align with meta-analysis results using standardized mean difference (SMD), providing evidence for meditation as an effective nonpharmacological intervention for fatigue management, while also informing effective meditation approaches.

A meditative relaxation approach called the mind sound resonance technique (MSRT) has shown promising effects on children, adolescents, and people with psychological illnesses. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSRT practice on brain hemodynamics, heart rate variability (HRV), mindfulness, and anxiety levels in college students. METHODS: Fifty volunteers in all genders (females, n = 30; males, n = 20) aged between 19 and 30 years were chosen from an educational institute and allocated into two groups, i.e., MSRT (n = 25) and supine rest (SR; n = 25). Enrolled participants were measured cerebral hemodynamics and HRV before, during, and after the MSRT or SR practice. The self-reported assessments including state anxiety and mindfulness were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that practicing MSRT significantly improved oxygenation (p < 0.05) in the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) and increased low-frequency (LF) (p < 0.05) and decreased high-frequency (HF) (p < 0.05) component of HRV when compared to the baseline. The between-group analysis showed a significant difference between MSRT and SR in the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal (SDNN) (p < 0.05) component of HRV. CONCLUSION: These crumbs of evidence imply that MSRT sessions may foster the development of anxiety-related coping skills by elevating mindfulness, promoting PFC oxygenation, and modulating HRV in MSRT practitioners."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of meditation-based therapies in relieving the symptoms severity, quality of life, stress and other associated mood conditions, in individuals with chronic neuropathy of various etiologies. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials, involving adult patients with persistent peripheral neuropathy, was performed. Seven article databases were searched. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the benefits of meditation-based therapy on symptomatology, quality of life, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, sleep quality and mindfulness score. Ten of the 1133 reviewed papers were selected for quantitative review. The meditation group had a lower standardized mean difference (SMD) score (-0.47 (95% CI: -0.97 to 0.02), p=0.062) for neuropathic pain severity score; lower anxiety scores (-2.5 (95% CI: -3.68 to -1.32), p=<0.001); lower depression scores (-1.53 (95% CI: -2.12 to -0.93), p=<0.001); lower perceived stress (-1.06 (95% CI: -3.15 to 1.04), p=0.323); higher quality of life scores (2.19 (95% CI: -0.65 to 5.03), p=0.13); lower sleep quality scores (-1.27 (95% CI: -4.22 to 1.67), p=0.397); higher mindfulness scores (6.71 (95% CI: 4.09 to 9.33), p=<0.001); and lower pain severity at 1 to 1.5 follow up (-1.75 (95% CI: -2.98 to -0.51), p=0.006). Some of the results were characterized by a substantial, statistically significant heterogeneity. Nevertheless, a major part of the results pointed in the same direction, improving symptomatology with meditation-based therapy. The studies had a risk of bias mostly regarding the measurement of the outcome, randomization process and selection of the reported result. The current study discovered that the meditation group had significantly lower pain (at 1 to 1.5 months follow-up) anxiety, and depression scores and higher mindfulness scores at the end of the interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rather than a passive reflection of nociception, pain is shaped by the interplay between one's experiences, current cognitive-affective states, and expectations. The placebo response, a paradoxical yet reliable phenomenon, is postulated to reduce pain by engaging mechanisms shared with active therapies. It has been assumed that mindfulness meditation, practiced by sustaining nonjudgmental awareness of arising sensory events, merely reflects mechanisms evoked by placebo. Recently, brain-based multivariate pattern analysis has been validated to successfully disentangle nociceptive-specific, negative affective, and placebo-based dimensions of the subjective pain experience. METHODS: To determine whether mindfulness meditation engages distinct brain mechanisms from placebo and sham mindfulness to reduce pain, multivariate pattern analysis pain signatures were applied across 2 randomized clinical trials that employed overlapping psychophysical pain testing procedures (49 °C noxious heat; visual analog pain scales) and distinct functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques (blood oxygen level-dependent; perfusion based). After baseline pain testing, 115 healthy participants were randomized into a 4-session mindfulness meditation (n = 37), placebo-cream conditioning (n = 19), sham mindfulness meditation (n = 20), or book-listening control (n = 39) intervention. After each intervention, noxious heat was administered during functional magnetic resonance imaging and each manipulation. RESULTS: A double dissociation in the multivariate pattern analysis signatures supporting pain regulation was revealed by mindfulness meditation compared with placebo cream. Mindfulness meditation produced significantly greater reductions in pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings and nociceptive-specific and negative affective pain signatures than placebo cream, sham mindfulness meditation, and control interventions. The placebo-cream group significantly lowered the placebo-based signature. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness meditation and placebo engaged distinct and granular neural pain signatures to reduce pain.",

Nursing students were categorized into experimental groups I (VR-based meditation) and II (concentration meditation) and a control group.

Stress levels and heart rate variability were measured before and after study completion. On the first day, all three groups slept without any intervention. On days 2-6, only experimental groups I and II implemented the intervention before sleeping. We found that the subjective sleep quality, wakefulness after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, deep sleep quality, subjective stress, objective stress, and autonomic nervous system balance of the VR meditation group were significantly better than those of the other groups. Our results reveal that the participants who underwent VR-based meditation experienced better sleep quality, lower stress levels, and improved autonomic nervous system balance compared with those in the concentration meditation and control groups. Thus, VR-based meditation effectively enhances sleep quality, lowers stress levels, and improves autonomic nervous system balance in nursing students."

Surgery remains the primary treatment for many common types of cancer. One promising potential intervention to alleviate anxiety in the preoperative and postoperative period is meditation, an integrative medicine intervention. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the effectiveness of meditation to alleviate anxiety during the perioperative time period. METHODS: The scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework to synthesize the study findings and was reported with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The review included EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, and Cochrane Review databases from 2013 through 2024. All identified articles were exported to the online systematic review software, Covidence. RESULTS: A total of 538 initial citations were identified, 415 titles and abstracts were screened, and 83 full-text articles reviewed. Six studies were finally included. The data extracted from the literature included: study purpose, study design, sample size, preoperative or postoperative timeframe, instrument to evaluate anxiety, and conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing oncology surgery, the perioperative period can be filled with anxiety. Guided, mindfulness, and loving-kindness meditation may be helpful in reducing anxiety, particularly in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer during the postoperative period. However, the current literature is extremely limited. Future research should expand on the preliminary effectiveness to broader populations and carefully target the highest-risk populations for the ideal time point for interventions."

METHODS: Adults (N = 67) with a primary anxiety disorder were recruited to participate in the study. Participants were randomized to escitalopram, a common treatment for anxiety disorders, or MBSR. Absenteeism and job performance were measured with the Health and Work Performance (HPQ) questionnaire prior to treatment and at the week 24 follow up. RESULTS: At week 24, individuals in the escitalopram arm and the MBSR arm showed significant improvements in partial days of missed work due to mental/physical health problems from baseline (1.00 [0.00-2.50] to 0.00 [0.00 = 1.00], p = .034 and 0.00 [0.00-2.00] to 0.00 [0.00 = 1.00], p = .001, respectively).

None of the outcome variables significantly varied by group at baseline or week 24. CONCLUSIONS: Our study finds evidence that MBSR improves work performance equivalently to SSRI medication among individuals with anxiety disorders.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based, in-person programs are effective at reducing stress and enhancing resilience in military and civilian samples, yet few studies have examined or compared training offered via real-time, interactive social media. Such a program would have a wider-reach and could include those unable to attend in-person. There is also interest in resolving ambiguity about the effects of mindfulness training on individual difference variables, such as self-compassion. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to compare pre/post self-compassion for three interventions; Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction delivered in-person (IP), mindfulness meditation training delivered via a Virtual World (VW), and a wait-list Control Group (CG) among active duty and veteran U.S. military. METHODS: A 2 (pre/post)×3 (group) factorial design was conducted with 250 active duty and veteran U.S. Military service members, with self-compassion measures as dependent variables. RESULTS: Self Compassion improved 10% for the IP group and 14% for the VW group, while the CG group did not improve. Combined treatment groups yielded a 10.3% improvement in self-compassion compared with no change in the CG and with a group×time interaction effect (p < 0.01). Participants with lower initial self-compassion experienced greater benefits than those with higher baseline self-compassion (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: IP and VW Mindfulness Meditation training were equally effective in increasing self-compassion. Adding effective on-line mindfulness delivery will promote self-compassion among a more extensive audience, likely yielding improved coping, confidence, connectedness, cheerfulness, steadiness, and self-satisfaction, while lessening anxiety, fear-of-failure, and stress among participants.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Our study aimed to compare meditation and compassion-based group therapy with the standard of care in patients with eating disorders, drug addiction, alcohol addiction, and depression, concerning acceptance, mindfulness awareness, self-compassion, and psychological distress. Methods A controlled designed study was performed, comparing meditation and compassion-focused group therapy added to the standard of care with the standard of care alone, on patients with eating disorders, drug addiction, alcohol addiction, and mood disorders. Four validated questionnaires were administered: the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II), which assesses the ability to be fully in touch with the present moment; the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), which assesses the ability to experience consciously what is happening in the present moment; the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), which assesses self-compassion characteristics, including loving-kindness; and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), which measures psychological distress (anxiety, depression, psychotic behavior, etc.). Results There was a total of 75 subjects, out of which 48 represented the experimental group, and 27 represented the control group. The overall mean age of the subjects was 44.8 ± 13.2 years. There were statistically significant increases in the experimental group (baseline vs. end of study) for the AAQ-II, MAAS, and SCS scores, and a statistically significant decrease in the SCL-90 score. In the control group, there was a statistically significant decrease in the SCL-90 score, but no significant differences for other measurements. The comparisons between the two groups at the end of the study were as follows: AAQ-II: 0.7 (-5.74 to 7.15), p = 0.827; MAAS: 4.78 (-3.19 to 12.75), p = 0.233; SCS: 5.89 (-3.18 to 14.96), p = 0.199; SCL-90: -0.26 (-0.62 to 0.1), p = 0.157. Conclusion Within the experimental group, all scales improved statistically significantly. There were no statistically significant differences at the end of the study concerning the four scales between the groups. The comparison between groups was limited by data availability."

Transcendental Meditation (TM) has been shown to reduce stress and improve health and well-being. The current review aimed to synthesize the evidence on the effects of TM on cardiometabolic outcomes and identify gaps for future research. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases for relevant literature. Forty-five papers that reported studies of TM on cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases were included. Evidence shows that TM is effective in reducing blood pressure (BP). We found some evidence that TM can improve insulin resistance and may play a role in improving dyslipidemia, exercise tolerance, and myocardial blood flow, and in reducing carotid intima-media thickness and left ventricular mass. Studies show that long-term TM practice can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and CVD mortality. This review identified that certain studies have high participant drop-out rates, and fewer studies targeted comprehensive cardiometabolic outcomes beyond BP with longer follow-up periods. We found that most studies were conducted in specific populations, which may limit generalizability. In conclusion, TM has the potential to improve cardiometabolic health; however, research gaps highlight the need for larger phase III multicenter clinical trials with long-term follow-ups.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Informal practice (i.e., brief meditation practices incorporated spontaneously into daily activities) may be important for increasing the efficacy and accessibility of meditation-based interventions (MedBIs). However, the facilitators and barriers to engaging in informal practice are largely unknown. The current study aimed to investigate factors associated with the implementation of informal practice. METHOD: Participants were drawn from a randomized trial testing the effects of 5- versus 15-min daily meditation practice in a 4-week smartphone-delivered meditation training. Qualitative interviews on informal practice were conducted with 17 participants (mean age: 37.12 years; 82.35% female; 52.94% non-Latinx White) following the intervention. Given that prior knowledge on this topic is limited, inductive content analysis was utilized to characterize participants' experiences in relation to implementing informal practice. RESULTS: Four overarching categories emerged from the data, namely (a) reported benefits of informal practice, (b) integration of informal practice, (c) perceived barriers to informal practice, and (d) recommended facilitators of informal practice. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the importance of addressing barriers and facilitators (e.g., providing personalized app features, reminders, social support, and repeating intervention content) to encourage individuals' informal practice. Findings provide suggestions for methods to increase engagement in informal practice, which may, in turn, increase the accessibility and effectiveness of MedBIs. PREREGISTRATION: The larger trial from which the qualitative interview participants were drawn was preregistered through clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05229406) and the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/fszvj/?view_only=039b14ccbf8848bd99808c983070b635). The qualitative analyses reported here were not preregistered."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental health issues are a major cause of poor life outcomes. Heartfulness (HFN) meditation is recommended for stress management and daily awareness. Although studies have shown that HFN can improve burnout and well-being, the biological mechanism underlying oxidative stress markers in a healthy human is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether HFN meditation benefits mindfulness responses and also to examine the impact of HFN meditation on oxidative stress in healthy individuals. METHODS: This prospective study involved 60 healthy individuals aged 18-24, divided into experimental and control groups, and implemented an HFN meditation intervention over 12 weeks. Both groups' serum malondialdehyde and serum nitrate levels were examined before and after the intervention. Additionally, psychometric evaluations concerning mindfulness and experiential avoidance were conducted utilizing scales such as the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), and Experiential Avoidance (EA). RESULTS: Following a three-month intervention period, serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the experimental group did not show a significant increase, whereas in the control group, there was a significant increase (p < 0.000). Conversely, serum nitrate levels in the experimental group exhibited a significant increase (p < 0.05). Additionally, psychological stress decreased, as indicated by various questionnaire tools such as MAAS, FFMQ, SCS, and EA, with mindfulness showing an increase. However, a decrease in EA was seen. CONCLUSION: Heartfulness meditation has a positive impact on both mindfulness and oxidative stress. This suggests that consistent, long-term participation in HFN meditation could enhance mental health and foster overall well-being."

This study aimed to determine if meditation training, by comparison to active and passive control groups, is linked to changes in the perception of cognitive functioning in older adults. One hundred thirty-four healthy older participants from the Age-Well Randomized Clinical Trial were included: 45 followed a meditation training, 45 a non-native language training and 44 had no intervention. Subjective cognition was assessed at baseline and following the 18-month intervention period. Perception of attentional efficiency was assessed using internal and external Attentional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) subscale scores. Perception of global cognitive capacities was measured via the total score of Cognitive Difficulties Scale (CDS). Deltas ([posttest minus pretest scores]/standard deviation at pretest) were calculated for the analyses. Generalized mixed effects models controlling for age, sex, education and baseline scores revealed that meditation training decreased the vulnerability score toward external distractors measured by the ASQ compared to non-native language training. However, no between-groups differences on ASQ internal or CDS total scores were observed. Results suggest a beneficial effect of meditation practice on perceived management of external distracting information in daily life. Meditation training may cultivate the ability to focus on specific information (e.g., breath) and ignore stimulation from other kinds of stimuli (e.g., noise).",

The study aims to assess the effectiveness of meditation on wellness management among corporate employees in India. METHODS: The quasi-experimental controlled study design was employed from May to June 2021, which assessed stress, QoL, and wellness indices (satisfaction with life, well-being) with meditation practice as the intervention. The online questionnaire incorporates questions from the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, World Health Organization (WHO) QoL Scale, Five-item Satisfaction with Life scale and WHO-5 Well-being Index. A nonrandom sampling technique selected 146 and 74 subjects in the intervention and control groups, respectively, among the employees of Star health- and allied insurance company. The data was analyzed using SPSS V27 (©IBM SPSS Statistics). The Wilcoxon signed rank test for the dependent groups, and Mann-Whitney U test for the independent groups (between subjects) was performed. RESULTS: Among a total of 220 subjects who enrolled in the recruitment survey, 146 subjects underwent the intervention thus providing a response rate of 66.4%. For the intervention group, the difference (within group) in mean scores between baseline and endline assessment shows a reduction in stress (0.02) and significant improvement in QoL (0.21) and wellness indices (satisfaction with life: 0.21, well-being: 0.24). The difference (between the experimental and control groups) in mean endline scores shows a decrease in stress (0.07), an increase in wellness indices (satisfaction with life: 0.12, well-being: 0.23), and a significant change in the QoL (0.17). CONCLUSION: Meditation intervention in corporate wellness programs enhances the QoL, wellness, and stress management, establishing the effectiveness of health profile-raising ingenuities at the workplace."

      "abstract": "Contemplative neuroscience has increasingly explored meditation using neuroimaging. However, the brain mechanisms underlying meditation remain elusive. Here, we implemented a mechanistic framework to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of expert meditators during meditation and rest, and controls during rest. We first applied a model-free approach by defining a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space for each condition, consisting of different probabilities of occurrence from a repertoire of dynamic patterns. Moreover, we implemented a model-based approach by adjusting the PMS of each condition to a whole-brain model, which enabled us to explore in silico perturbations to transition from resting-state to meditation and vice versa. Consequently, we assessed the sensitivity of different brain areas regarding their perturbability and their mechanistic local-global effects. Overall, our work reveals distinct whole-brain dynamics in meditation compared to rest, and how transitions can be induced with localized artificial perturbations. It motivates future work regarding meditation as a practice in health and as a potential therapy for brain disorders."

This study assessed the prevalence and 20 year trends in the use of these practices in US adults between 2002-2022. We examined practice use and associations with sociodemographic and health factors in a population-weighted analysis of n = 134,959 participants across 5 cycles of the National Health Interview Survey. The overall use of meditation (18.3%, 60.53 million), yoga (16.8%, 55.78 million) and guided imagery/progressive relaxation (6.7%, 22.22 million) increased significantly from 2002 to 2022. Growth was consistent across most sociodemographic and health strata, however users of 'Other' race (comprising 54% Indigenous Americans, Odds Ratios; ORs = 1.28-1.70) and users with moderate (ORs = 1.19-1.29) psychological distress were overrepresented across all practices, and those with severe psychological distress were overrepresented in meditation (OR = 1.33) and guided imagery/progressive relaxation (OR = 1.42). Meditation use has accelerated over time for 65 + year olds (OR = 4.22), people not accessing mental health care (OR = 1.39), and less educated (OR = 4.02) groups, potentially reflecting unmet health needs.

One newly introduced approach to improve coping is loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Some studies have shown the effectiveness of the LKM on the mental health of nurses, though more evidence is required to support them. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the LKM on job-related burnout of nurses working in NICU. This clustered controlled randomized clinical trial assessed job-related burnout before and after a month of practicing LKM guided through a virtual method. A total of 66 eligible NICU nurses from 2 referral children hospitals in Tehran were randomly assigned to 2 control (n = 33) and intervention (n = 33) groups. The intervention was performed 3 times a week for 1 month in the form of 20-minute audio files of LKM for the intervention group, and educational files on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic were sent to the control group. The instruments used in this study were the demographic information questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which participants completed before and after the intervention. The mean difference in the overall scores of burnout before and after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly reduced (P = .003), but no significant difference was observed in the control group (P = .018). These findings support the benefit of LKM in NICU nurses in reducing burnout.",

The Pathways to Wellness (PTW; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03025139) randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated beneficial effects of two behavioral interventions (survivorship education [SE] and mindful awareness practices [MAPs]) on depressive symptoms in younger BCS. We conducted an exploratory secondary analysis to identify moderators of intervention effects. METHODS: Women diagnosed with stage 0 to III breast cancer at or before age 50 years who completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of SE (n = 81), MAPs (n = 85), or waitlist control (WLC; n = 81). Moderators assessed at baseline included psychological distress (depression and anxiety), intervention preference, preparedness for survivorship, and time since initial diagnosis. Linear regression models tested the modifying effects of each variable on postintervention depression in SE versus WLC and MAPs versus WLC. RESULTS: Baseline levels of depression (β = -.03, P < .01) and anxiety (β = -.64, P = .02) moderated effects of SE on depressive symptoms, as did preparedness for survivorship (β = 3.17, P = .02). Participants randomly assigned to SE who had the highest levels of depression or anxiety and who felt least prepared for survivorship showed the largest reductions in depressive symptoms from preintervention to postintervention. Similar effects were not observed for MAPs. Intervention preference and time since diagnosis did not moderate intervention effects for either SE or MAPs. CONCLUSION: Our 6-week, group-based SE program may be most beneficial for women with higher levels of psychological distress and those who feel least prepared for cancer survivorship. By contrast, a 6-week mindfulness awareness practice intervention appears to benefit younger BCS regardless of pretreatment characteristics.",

METHODS: According to the retrospective analysis method, 150 stroke patients hospitalized in the rehabilitation center of a Tangshan Workers' Hospital from July 2020 to December 2023 were selected as study objects. They were divided into three groups, namely the control group (routine rehabilitation care, n = 50), observation group A (meditation training, n = 50), and observation group B (meditation training and ward noise management, n = 50) according to whether they received ward noise management and meditation training. The general demographic data, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) were collected. Chi-square test and analysis of variance were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The baseline data of the patients in each group were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Before treatment, no difference in the FSS, PSQI, SF-36 scores and environmental noise level between the groups (P > 0.05) was observed. After management, the scores of SF-36 in observation group B were higher than those in the control group and observation group A (P < 0.05) except for somatic pain. Other indicators in observation group B were lower than those in the control and observation group A (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ward noise management and meditation training can effectively reduce patients' fatigue, significantly reducing ambient noise levels, promoting the improvement of life quality, and improving sleep quality.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of combining at-home anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left primary motor cortex (M1) with mindfulness meditation (MM) in fibromyalgia patients trained in mindfulness. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were allocated to receive ten daily sessions of MM paired with either anodal or sham tDCS over the primary motor cortex. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were psychological impairment, sleep quality, mood, affective pain, mindfulness level, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of cortical excitability. Outcomes were analyzed pre- and post-treatment, with a one-month follow-up. RESULTS: We found post-tDCS improvement in all clinical outcomes, including mindfulness level, except for positive affect and stress, in both groups without significant difference between active and sham conditions. No significant group*time interaction was found for all clinical and TMS outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate no synergistic or add-on efffect of anodal tDCS of the left M1 compared to the proper effect of MM in patients with fibromyalgia. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings challenge the potential of combining anodal tDCS of the left M1 and MM in fibromyalgia.",

The current research proposes a novel approach using a loving kindness meditation (LKM). Experiment 1 tests whether random assignment to the LKM intervention reduces explicit and implicit anti-fat bias and increases empathy based on the LKM recipient with higher weight (close other vs. stranger). Experiment 2 tests whether LKM outperforms an empathy intervention or control to increase empathy or reduce stigmatizing behavior. Results revealed that the LKM increased empathic care but did not reduce anti-fat bias compared to control; the LKM intervention, but not the empathy intervention, reported greater empathy compared to control in unadjusted analyses; and participants in the LKM and empathy interventions (vs. control) were more likely to engage in stigmatizing behavior.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Since the prevalence and cost of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are high in the United States, research on affordable preventative and treatment approaches is needed. While meditation shows promise for heart-health promotion, there is little knowledge about its use among people with CVD and factors that may influence its usage. In response, the purposes of the current research are to (a) shed light on the proportion of people with CVD who practice meditation; and (b) reveal variables that predict the use of meditation among them. RESEARCH METHOD: A secondary data analysis was conducted using data from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey. A total of 4,197 data entries (respondents with CVD) were included for analysis, and both descriptive and logistic regression analysis results were reported. RESULTS: Approximately 16% of respondents with CVD practiced meditation. Among them, many used spiritual (82.5%) meditation, followed by mindfulness (29.9%), and mantra (24.9%) meditation. Females (odds ratio [OR] = 1.69), those advised to increase physical activity (OR = 1.34), and email users (OR = 1.63) had higher odds; and those able to afford medication (OR = 0.70) or mental health care/counseling (OR = 0.46) had lower odds to use meditation compared to respective counterparts. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: There is a significant proportion of people with CVD who used meditation practices, especially spiritual meditations. However, more research is needed to reveal the determinants of meditation use among people with CVD to facilitate their heart-health-self-care.

Interventions incorporating knowledge from neuroscience could provide for more successful intervention methods. METHODS: The current pilot study set out to assess the feasibility and usability of the study protocol of a 4-week neuromeditation training in adult forensic outpatients with impulse control problems. The neuromeditation training, which prompts awareness and control over brain states of restlessness with EEG neurofeedback, was offered in addition to treatment as usual (predominantly CBT). RESULTS: Eight patients completed the neuromeditation training under guidance of their therapists. Despite some emerging obstacles, overall, the training was rated sufficiently usable and feasible by patients and their therapists. DISCUSSION: The provided suggestions for improvement can be used to implement the intervention in treatment and set up future trials to study the effectiveness of neuromeditation in offender treatment."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), recently identified internet gaming disorder (IGD) as a condition warranting more research, and few empirically validated treatments exist. Mindfulness meditation (MM) has multiple health benefits; however, its efficacy in treating IGD and potential neural mechanisms underlying MM treatment of the disorder remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of MM used to treat adults with IGD and to identify neural mechanisms underlying MM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was performed from October 1 to November 30, 2023, at Hangzhou Normal University in Hangzhou, China. Adults (aged ≥18 years) who met at least 6 of the 9 DSM-5-TR proposed criteria for IGD were recruited to receive either MM or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Data analysis was performed on December 1, 2023. INTERVENTION: Participants underwent MM training (an 8-session meditation program that focuses on attention and acceptance) and PMR training (an 8-time program for body relaxation) delivered in groups that met 2 times each week for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This per-protocol analysis included only participants who finished the pretest assessment, 8 training sessions, and posttest assessment. The main outcomes were addiction severity (measured with the DSM-5-TR proposed criteria for IGD and with Internet Addiction Test scores), gaming craving (measured with Questionnaire for Gaming Urges scores), and blood oxygen level-dependent signals assessed with cue-craving tasks on fMRI. Behavioral and brain measurements were compared using analysis of variance. Functional connectivity (FC) among identified brain regions was measured to test connectivity changes associated with MM. RESULTS: This study included 64 adults with IGD. A total of 32 participants received MM (mean [SD] age, 20.3 [1.9] years; 17 women [53%]) and 32 received PMR (mean [SD] age, 20.2 [1.5] years; 16 women [50%]). The severity of IGD decreased in the MM group (pretest vs posttest: mean [SD], 7.0 [1.1] vs 3.6 [0.8]; P < .001) and in the PMR group (mean [SD], 7.1 [0.9] vs 6.0 [0.9]; P = .04). The MM group had a greater decrease in IGD severity than the PMR group (mean [SD] score change for the MM group vs the PMR group, -3.6 [0.3] vs -1.1 [0.2]; P < .001). Mindfulness meditation was associated with decreased brain activation in the bilateral lentiform nuclei (r = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.60; P = .02), insula (r = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60; P = .047), and medial frontal gyrus (MFG; r = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.70; P = .01). Increased MFG-lentiform FC and decreased craving (pretest vs posttest: mean [SD], 58.8 [15.7] vs 33.6 [12.0]; t = -8.66; ƞ2 = 0.30; P < .001) was observed after MM, and changes in MFG-lentiform FC mediated the relationship between increased mindfulness and decreased craving (mediate effect, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.08; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, MM was more effective in decreasing addiction severity and gaming cravings compared with PMR. These findings indicate that MM may be an effective treatment for IGD and may exert its effects by altering frontopallidal pathways.

METHODS: In this randomized controlled, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial, we recruited a total of 136 elderly individuals who were over 60 years with nonorganic sleep disorders to participate in a 4-week RRMT intervention from October 2020 to October 2022. The intervention occurred twice a week, totaling eight times. These individuals were divided into high and low groups based on the vividness of visual imagery, and then randomly assigned to either the control or intervention groups, as follows: low-visualizers intervention group (LI group); low-visualizers control group (LC group); high-visualizers intervention group (HI group); high-visualizers control group (HC group). Their social and psychological parameters were assessed before and after the intervention by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Revised Piper's fatigue scale (RPFS), General well-being scale (GWB), and Satisfaction rating. The alpha waves of patients were also collected through electroencephalogram to assess their level of relaxation. RESULTS: Compared to the LI group, the HI group had a greater reduction rate in the PSQI score [25.2 % (18.8 % to 31.7 %), P < 0∙001], shorter sleep latency (P = 0.001), lower frequency of sleep medication (P < 0.001), lower PSQI scores (P < 0.001), and higher GWB scores (P < 0.001). There were significant differences in all indicators in the HI group vs. HC group and in the LI group vs. LC group. In the first five relaxation training sessions, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of α waves between the LI group and the LC group; however, from the sixth session onward, we observed a statistically significant difference (t = 2.86, P = 0.019)，while The HI group and HC group showing significant differences in the first relaxation training session (t = 4.464, P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in subjective satisfaction between the intervention group and the control group (x2 = 49.605, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that most elderly people benefitted from RRMT regardless of their vividness of visual imagery. However, low-visualizers experienced slower and less effective results, so these patients may benefit more from alternative approaches.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Muscle cramps are common among persons with cirrhosis and are associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Treatment options are limited. We compared stretching or meditation in a randomized-controlled trial (RCT). PATIENTS: We enrolled 98 patients with a history of >4 muscle cramps in the prior month from 7/22-7/23. We randomized patients 1:1 to stretching versus meditation for 35 days. Our primary outcome was the change in cramp severity measured by the visual analogue scale for cramps (VAS-cramps, scaled 0-10). Secondary outcomes included a patient global impression of change (PGIC), change in sleep quality and global HRQOL measured using the EQ-5D and VAS-global HRQOL. RESULTS: Overall, 48% of patients had cirrhosis, 40% had diabetes, 16% the median age was 63, most were women (67%) and 81% were college educated. Both arms experienced a reduction in cramp severity-a median of 1.44 (.58-2.29) points for stretching and 1.97 (1.01-2.93) points for meditation. These changes were significant changes from baseline (p = .001 for stretching, p < .0001 for meditation) but these changes were equivalent between arms (p = .4). The PGIC was improved: 1.33 (1.02-1.65) for stretching, 1.05 (.70-1.41) for meditation, p-difference .2. Sleep was also improved for both. HRQOL did not change according to the Eq5D; according to the VAS, HRQOL rose for meditation by 6 (.1-11.8) points but not for stretching. More patients recommended stretching than meditation (79.2% vs. 55.3%, p = .02). CONCLUSION: In a randomized trial, stretching and meditation both reduced cramp severity and improved sleep quality and global impression of change. While patients preferred stretching, there was no difference in effect between arms.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Mindfulness interventions (yoga, meditation) in traumatic brain injury populations show promising improvements in injury outcomes. However, most studies include all injury severities and use in-person, general programming lacking accessibility and specificity to the nuance of concussion. Therefore, this study investigated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an online, concussion-focused meditation intervention among young adults with a concussion history. DESIGN: Unblinded, single-arm, pilot intervention. METHODS: Fifteen young adults aged 18 to 30 with a concussion history within the past 5 years completed 10 to 20 minutes per day of online, guided meditations for 6 weeks. Feasibility was assessed using the Feasibility of Intervention Measure. Concussion symptoms were measured using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire, perceived stress the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and mindfulness the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics described the study sample and determined intervention adherence and feasibility. Paired sample t tests were used to examine preintervention/postintervention changes in concussion symptoms, perceived stress, and mindfulness, with descriptive statistics further detailing significant t tests. RESULTS: Fifteen participants were enrolled, and 12 completed the intervention. The majority completed 5+ days per week of the meditations, and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (17.4 [1.8]) scores indicated high feasibility. Concussion symptom severity significantly decreased after completing the meditation intervention (11.3 [10.3]) compared with before the intervention (24.5 [17.2]; t[11] = 3.0, P = .01). The number of concussion symptoms reported as worse than before their concussion significantly decreased after completing the meditation intervention (2.7 [3.9]) compared with before the intervention (8.0 [5.7]; t[11] = 3.7, P = .004). Postintervention, 83.33% (n = 10) reported lower concussion symptom severity, and 75.00% (n = 9) reported less concussion symptoms as a mild, moderate, or severe problem (ie, worse than before injury). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest positive adherence and feasibility of the meditation intervention, with the majority reporting concussion symptom improvement postintervention. Future research is necessary to expand these pilot findings into a large trial investigating concussion-specific meditation programming.",

In this pre-registered study, we investigate the effects of mindfulness training on lapses of attention (and their associated neural correlates) during meditation practice. For this purpose, we recorded Electroencephalogram (EEG) during meditation practice before and after 8 weeks of mindfulness training (or waitlist) in 41 participants (21 treatment and 20 controls). In order to detect lapses of attention and characterize their EEG correlates, we interrupted participants during meditation to report their level of focus and drowsiness. First, we show that self-reported lapses of attention during meditation practice were associated to an increased occurrence of theta oscillations (3-6 Hz), which were slower in frequency and more spatially widespread than theta oscillations occurring during focused attention states. Then, we show that mindfulness training did not reduce the occurrence of lapses of attention nor their associated EEG correlate (i.e. theta oscillations) during meditation. Instead, we find that mindfulness training was associated with a significant slowing of alpha oscillations in frontal electrodes during meditation. Crucially, frontal alpha slowing during meditation practice has been reported in experienced meditators and is thought to reflect relative decreases in arousal levels. Together, our findings provide insights into the EEG correlates of mindfulness meditation, which could have important implications for the identification of its mechanisms of action and/or the development of neuromodulation protocols aimed at facilitating meditation practice.",

Unfortunately, they often have a restricted range of treatment options available to alleviate menopausal symptoms. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore breast cancer survivors' experiences and effects of a yoga and meditation intervention supplementing previously reported RCT outcomes. METHODS: The qualitative data included in this study were part of a larger randomized controlled trial which evaluated the efficacy and safety of a 12-week yoga and meditation intervention on menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors. All participants who underwent the yoga intervention (n = 19) were invited to take part in semi-structured interviews after all quantitative data collection had been completed. Interviews (n = 9) were recorded, transcribed, and then coded into superordinate themes using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Nine female participants were interviewed, and the following themes emerged: (1) representations and expectations from the yoga intervention; (2) course structure and implementation; (3) perceptions and effects of the intervention (at emotional, physical, behavioral, and spiritual level); (4) differences between the study yoga intervention and other physical activities. CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with the accounts of participants, yoga might offer a promising intervention for breast cancer survivors. All those interviewed either currently attended a yoga class or expressed a desire to continue practicing yoga. Additionally, our findings inform future studies regarding aspects such as the importance of extending outcome measures beyond specific cancer-related complains, the advantages of addressing homogenous groups (i.e., breast cancer specific), or considering that different intervention components might need different assistance to encourage long-term use.",
