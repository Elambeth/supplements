      "abstract": "Gallic acid (GA), a natural organic phenolic compound, is an abundant plant food bioactive substance present in many medicinal herbs. GA has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities on multiple metabolic disorders. The present study was carried out to uncover the alleviating effects of GA on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and the underlying mechanisms of its action. In this study, a mouse model of MASH induced by high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet was used to test the impact of GA on metabolic disorders. We found that GA administration attenuated obesity and fatty liver, relieved insulin resistance, and mitigated hepatic steatosis, inflammation and liver injury. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse liver tissues identified 154 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the NCD, HFHC, and GA groups. Bioinformatic analysis of these DEGs revealed significant enrichment in lipid metabolism function and the PPARγ signaling pathway, which were further validated. Overexpression of PPARγ significantly reduced the therapeutic effect of GA both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6), a protective factor in metabolic stress, which was predicted as the upstream regulator, was significantly upregulated by GA. Furthermore, it was verified that GA's anti-lipid deposition effect depends on the negative regulation of IRF6 on PPARγ using knocking-down strategy. Taken together, GA increases hepatic IRF6 expression, which mitigates lipid accumulation of hepatocytes and subsequent liver damage via inhibiting the PPARγ signaling pathway. These findings suggest a novel strategy for MASH management based on pharmacological intervention with GA."

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of high-carbohydrate diets (HCD) on cognitive impairment is still being debated. To clarify the impact of HCD on the cognitive behavior of mice under low-pressure hypoxic conditions, we studied 24 mice in different environments while subjecting them to dietary intervention for 5 weeks, and conducting behavioral tests. Under low-pressure hypoxic conditions, HCD intervention reversed the decline in spatial learning and memory abilities in mice caused by hypoxia, ameliorated pathological brain damage, and restored the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. We also identified differences in the microbial community. Under low-pressure hypoxic conditions, the intestinal abundance of Parasutterella in mice decreased, the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Desulfovibrio increased, and apoptosis was more prevalent, possibly explaining the observed decreases in glutathione peroxidase activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the brain. HCD intervention increased the intestinal abundance of Bifidobacterium in hypoxic mice, reduced the abundances of Desulfovibrio and Faecalibaculum, and played antioxidant roles by lowering malondialdehyde levels and increasing superoxide dismutase activity in the brain by metabolizing amino acids and lipids. HCD also upregulated hippocampal BDNF levels and downregulated caspase 3. Collectively, these results are important because they help explain how HCD intervention can reduce hypoxia-induced damage to brain function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a prevalent complication of type 2 diabetes, influenced significantly by various dietary patterns. High-carbohydrate diets (HCDs) are commonly consumed nowadays; however, the specific impact of HCDs on cognitive function in diabetes remains unclear. METHODS: The objective of this study was to investigate whether an HCD has effects on cognition in diabetes. Eight-week-old diabetic (db/db) mice and wild-type (WT) mice underwent a twelve-week dietary intervention, including a normal diet (ND), an HCD, or a high-fat diet (HFD). Following this, behavioral tests were conducted, and related hippocampal pathology was evaluated. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that an HCD exacerbated cognitive decline in db/db mice compared to an ND. Additionally, an HCD increased amyloid-β burden and expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1. An HCD was also found to promote the phosphorylation of tau protein via the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway. Furthermore, an HCD markedly induced neuroinflammation and increased the quantity of microglia and astrocytes. However, these damages induced by an HCD were less severe than those caused by an HFD. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings indicate that a high intake of carbohydrates can have an adverse impact on cognitive function in diabetes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity represents a risk in the development of metabolic and oxidative stress (OS), as well as in male infertility. There is still no pharmacological treatment for obesity-induced male infertility, but the use of natural antioxidants has been proposed as a treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of a whole tomato lipid extract on rats that decreased their fertility and spermatogenesis after being induced obese with a high carbohydrate diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fourteen male Wistar rats of 12 weeks of age were used. Two groups were randomly formed non-obese control group (C, n = 54) and obese group (Ob, n = 54) that received 30% w/v sucrose solution for 3 months. Subsequently, the C and Ob group were divided into two groups: vehicle (C-Vh and Ob-Vh) that received corn oil as vehicle and tomato lipid extract (C-Ex and Ob-Ex) that received whole tomato lipid extract. The groups that received a hypercaloric diet had a gain in visceral and retroperitoneal adipose tissue, an increase in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased OS in the testis, and lesions in testicular histology, as well as a reduction in testicular size and sperm quality parameters (motility, viability, and concentration). RESULTS: Treatment with whole tomato lipid extract significantly decreased the weight of gonadal adipose tissue and OS, maintained testicular size, showed a significant increase in sperm quality parameters and improved histology of seminiferous tubules. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a greater therapeutic and beneficial effect of the tomato lipid extract on sperm quality parameters in obese rats and therefore on fertility.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary metformin supplementation on the redox balance, inflammation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and function in blunt snout bream fed a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet. Fish (45.12 ± 0.36 g) were randomly offered four diets, including a control diet (33% carbohydrate), an HC diet (45% carbohydrate), and the HC diet supplemented with 0.06% (HCM1) and 0.12% (HCM2) metformin respectively for 12 weeks. Compared with the control, feeding the HC diet significantly increased the hepatosomatic index (HSI), the mesenteric fat index, liver and muscle glycogen contents, liver and adipose tissue lipid contents, plasma glucose and glycation end products (AGES) levels and aspartate transaminase activity, plasma and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, hepatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) contents, mitochondrial cytochrome c content, mitochondrial complex IV activity and ATP 6 transcription, but decreased plasma catalase (CAT) activity, muscle superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, hepatic antioxidant enzymes activities, and the transcriptions of transforming growth factor β (tgfβ) and interleukin 10 (il10). Compared with the HC group, metformin treatment (especially the HCM2 group) significantly elevated tissue glycogen contents, muscle SOD activity, plasma and liver antioxidant enzymes activities, the transcriptions of tgfβ and il10, the sodium/potassium ATPase activity, the contents of mitochondrial protein and AMP, the level of p-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the p-AMPK/t-AMPK ratio, but lowered the HSI, tissue lipid contents, plasma levels of glucose, AGES and glycated serum protein, plasma, and liver MDA contents, the transcriptions of il1β, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 and ATP 6, the contents of ATP and cytochrome c, the ATP/AMP ratio, and the activities of complexes I and IV. In conclusion, metformin could attenuate the HC diet-induced redox imbalance, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in blunt snout bream.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD) represents a complex condition ranging from simple steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver, NAFL) to inflammation, and fibrosis is one of the main features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The pathogenesis of NAFLD is not well established but involves several factors (i.e., predisposition of genetic variants, obesity, and unhealthy lifestyle as unbalanced diets) that lead to an alteration of lipid homeostasis and consequently to an abnormal accumulation of triglycerides and other lipids in the liver parenchyma. Currently, no resolutive pharmacological treatment for NAFLD is available, and the only therapeutic approach is a healthy diet and physical exercise. In this study, we investigated the potential beneficial effect of GprA, a new synthetic agonist of G-protein-coupled receptor 120/free fatty acid receptor 4 (GPR120/FFAR4), in the progression of NAFL/NASH in mice fed for different periods (26 weeks and 30 weeks), with a high-fat (40% kcal) and high-carbohydrate diet, also called a Western-style diet (WSD). In our experimental model, the histological, protein, and transcriptomic analyses highlighted that the GprA can reduce signs of steatosis in WSD-fed mice. Furthermore, in 30 week-treated mice, GprA is also effective in the reduction of collagen deposition and fibrosis development. Altogether, our data validate the central role of FFAR4 in the context of NAFL/NASH onset and progression and reveal that GprA could represent an interesting candidate for the development of a new therapeutic approach in NAFLD treatment."

      "abstract": "Early dietary patterns potentially influence the health status and lifespan throughout adulthood and the entire lifespan. However, dietary behaviors are difficult for everyone to control during adolescence. It is even more important to study the effects of interventions of early dietary patterns on the lifespan under arbitrary feeding conditions. The research involves observing the survival status and lifespan of rats from weaning to adulthood with three different dietary patterns (a high-carbohydrate diet (HC), a high-protein diet (HP), and a high-fat diet (HF)) under ad libitum feeding conditions. The administration of high-carbohydrate diets leads to a significant extension of both median and maximum survival times (P < 0.05) in Wistar rats. Furthermore, it markedly enhanced the spatial memory capacity, mitigated the occurrence of liver and kidney pathological outcomes in elderly rats, and increased the abundance of gut microbiota improving amino acid metabolism. Additionally, feeding rats a high-carbohydrate diet improved glutathione (GSH) synthesis and recycling and activated the expression and upregulation of the lifespan-related proteins Foxo3a/Sirt3 and the key metabolic enzyme GPX-4. The high-carbohydrate diet from weaning to adulthood may potentially extend the lifespan by enhancing rat systemic glutathione synthesis, recycling, and improving the redox state pathway.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing interest in studies involving carbohydrate (CHO) manipulation and subsequent adaptations to endurance training. This study aimed to analyze whether a periodized carbohydrate feeding strategy based on a daily training session has any advantages compared to a high-carbohydrate diet in well-trained cyclists. Seventeen trained cyclists (VO2peak = 70.8 ± 6.5 mL·kg-1·min-1) were divided into two groups, a periodized (PCHO) group and a high-carbohydrate (HCHO) group. Both groups performed the same training sessions for five weeks. In the PCHO group, 13 training sessions were performed with low carbohydrate availability. In the HCHO group, all sessions were completed following previous carbohydrate intake to ensure high pre-exercise glycogen levels. In both groups, there was an increase in the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) (PCHO: 244.1 ± 29.9 W to 253.2 ± 28.4 W; p = 0.008; HCHO: 235.8 ± 21.4 W to 246.9 ± 16.7 W; p = 0.012) but not in the time to exhaustion at MLSS intensity. Both groups increased the percentage of muscle mass (PCHO: p = 0.021; HCHO: p = 0.042) and decreased the percent body fat (PCHO: p = 0.021; HCHO: p = 0.012). We found no differences in carbohydrate or lipid oxidation, heart rate, and post-exercise lactate concentration. Periodizing the CHO intake in well-trained cyclists during a 5-week intervention did not elicit superior results to an energy intake-matched high-carbohydrate diet in any of the measured outcomes.",

Acute injection of rFGF21 into rainbow trout effectively reduced serum glucose levels. To investigate the effect of rFGF21 on high-carbohydrate diet (HCD)-induced metabolic disorders in rainbow trout, a 31-day feeding experiment was conducted. At the end of the third week, fish were injected with either PBS or rFGF21. The results showed that the final body weight (FBW) significantly increased in rainbow trout on an HCD (P < 0.05), but there were potential risks including disturbances in glycolipid metabolism and increased inflammatory responses. However, these effects were altered by rFGF21 treatment. In addition, rFGF21 promotes glucose uptake by increasing the phosphorylation levels of AKT (protein kinase B) and GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β), increasing hepatic glycogen, thereby lowering serum glucose. Notably, the rFGF21 did not exacerbate the inflammatory response but downregulated the expression of inflammatory factors. Interestingly, the activation of autophagy and the AMPK pathway may contribute to the positive effect of rFGF21, where rFGF21 injection significantly increased the levels of LC3I/II protein and phosphorylate AMPKα (P < 0.05).",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Maca root (Lepidium meyenii Walp.) is a Peruvian plant of the Brassicaceae family. Maca roots are popular food supplements used to treat a variety of ailments described traditionally as enhancing metabolic and health conditions. AIM OF THE STUDY: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been the real scourge globally, affecting more than one-fourth of the global population. MetS causes the development of multi-organ illnesses, including altered blood cholesterol and sugar levels, oxidative stress, and hypertension. This study evaluated maca root total methanolic extract (MTE) as a potential nutraceutical to manage the complications of MetS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the first 4 weeks of a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet (HFCD), streptozotocin (STZ) was injected in Wistar rats to induce the MetS model. Animals were treated orally with MTE at 100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg for 4 weeks compared to metformin at 200 mg/kg after confirmation of diabetes. RESULTS: One month of MTE supplementation in HFCD-fed rats remarkably decreased the elevation of blood glucose and lipids, improved liver function and insulin resistance, additionally it successfully restored the state of inflammatory and oxidative stress. The extract was standardized to contain total phenolics equal to 24.45 ± 0.96 μg Gallic acid/mg extract. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MTE improves MetS by reducing hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress. While also improving beta cell secretory functions, implying that MTE could be used as a balancing drug in the prevention and treatment of metabolic abnormalities linked to type 2 diabetes.",

This study investigates the effect of a high-calorie diet (high fat diet [HFD], high carbohydrate diet [HCD] and high energy diet [HED]) on appetite and central AMPK in blunt snout bream. In the present study, fish (average initial weight 45.84 ± 0.07 g) were fed the control, HFD, HCD and HED in four replicates for 12 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, the result showed that body mass index, specific growth rate, feed efficiency ratio and feed intake were not affected (p > 0.05) by dietary treatment. However, fish fed the HFD obtained a significantly higher (p < 0.05) lipid productive value, lipid gain and lipid intake than those fed the control diet, but no significant difference was attributed to others. Also, a significantly higher (p < 0.05) energy intake content was found in fish-fed HFD, HCD and HED than those given the control diet. Long-term HFD and HCD feeding significantly increased (p < 0.05) plasma glucose, glycated serum protein, advanced glycation end product, insulin and leptin content levels than the control group. Moreover, a significantly lower (p < 0.05) complex 1, 2 and 3 content was found in fish-fed HFD and HCD than in the control, but no differences (p > 0.05) were attributed to those in HED. Fish-fed HED significantly upregulated (p < 0.05) hypothalamic ampα 1 and ampα 2 expression, whereas the opposite trend was observed in the hypothalamic mammalian target of rapamycin than those in HFD and HCD compared to the control. However, hypothalamic neuropeptide y, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (pparα), acetyl-coa oxidase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05) in the HCD group, while the opposite was seen in cholecystokinin expression compared to those in the control group. Our findings indicated that the central AMPK signal pathway and appetite were modulated according to the diet's energy level to regulate nutritional status and maintain energy homoeostasis in fish.",

      "abstract": "An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to explore the feasibility of Momordica charantia saponins (MCS) administration to facilitate the protein-sparing action of high carbohydrate in diets for juvenile common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with initial mass of 5.41 ± 0.02 g. Based on our previous study, four diets with different the ratio of protein and carbohydrate (P/C ratio) were designed: 32%P/40%C, 30%P/43%C, 28%P/46%C, 28%P/46%C supplemented with 0.16% MCS (28%P/46%C + MCS). Each diet treatment was divided into 3 replicates. Results revealed that 30%P/43%C group increased growth performance and intestinal digestion, decreased intestinal inflammation, and optimized the intestinal microbiota compared to 32%P/40%C group, which presented the stronger protein-sparing action of high carbohydrate. But if the P/C ratio reduced to 28%P/46%C or less, the saving action would be restrained. However, compared to the 30%P/43%C and 28%P/46%C groups, 28%P/46%C + MCS group significantly elevated growth performance and activities of digestive enzymes and antioxidative enzymes, whilst the opposite trend occurred in the contents of glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and malondialdehyde. In addition, 28%P/46%C + MCS group markedly upregulated the expressions of GH/IGF axis genes, genes involved in protein synthesis, antioxidant genes and anti-inflammatory cytokine, whilst the opposite trend occurred in the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, 28%P/46%C + MCS group obtained the remarkably higher Enterococcus proportion and lower Lactococcus proportion compared to the 30%P/43%C and 28%P/46%C groups, whereas the opposite occurred in 30%P/43%C group, which indicated that there existed differences in the improvement mechanism on intestinal microflora composition between MCS and appropriate P/C ratio. Combined with the above mentioned changes in our research, we concluded that 0.16% MCS administration in a 28%P/46%C diet could facilitate the protein-sparing action of high carbohydrate in diets for common carp, which could decrease the 5% dosage of soybean meal and synchronously reduce the 4% crude protein of diets without affecting the growth and immune ability for common carp.",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed either a control high-CHO diet (59% total energy from CHO; n = 8) or a VHCHO diet (76% total energy from CHO; n = 8) for 17 wk. At 4, 8, 12, and 16 wk of the dietary intervention, oral glucose tolerance test and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) measurements were taken to assess whole-body glucose tolerance and hepatic insulin resistance, respectively. The triacylglycerol concentration in the liver was measured at the end of the 17-wk intervention period. RESULTS: The VHCHO diet group showed significantly higher muscle glucose transporter 4 content and a smaller area under the curve for plasma glucose, but not insulin, in the oral glucose tolerance test compared with the control group. On the other hand, the VHCHO diet group had a significantly higher hepatic triacylglycerol concentration and HOMA-IR measurement compared with the control group. The hepatic triacylglycerol concentration was significantly and positively correlated with HOMA-IR. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that long-term intake of a VHCHO diet exerts differential effects on whole-body glucose tolerance and hepatic insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is closely linked to lifestyle factors, particularly dietary patterns, which have attracted interest as potential disease-modifying factors. Eating a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet is a promising dietary intervention against brain aging; however, its protective effect on PD remains elusive. Here, we found that an LPHC diet ameliorated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor deficits, decreased dopaminergic neuronal death, and increased the levels of striatal dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites in PD mice. Levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, were elevated in PD mice following LPHC treatment. Furthermore, the administration of FGF-21 exerted a protective effect on MPTP-induced PC12 cells, similar to the effect of an LPHC diet in MPTP-induced mice. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA from fecal microbiota revealed that an LPHC diet normalized the gut bacterial composition imbalance in PD mice, as evidenced by the increased abundance of the genera Bifidobacterium, Ileibacterium, Turicibacter, and Blautia and decreased abundance of Bilophila, Alistipes, and Bacteroides. PICRUSt-predicted fecal microbiome function revealed that an LPHC diet suppressed lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), biosynthesis of ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinones, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways caused by MPTP, and enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrate metabolism, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. A nonmetabolomic analysis of the serum and feces showed that an LPHC diet significantly increased the levels of aromatic amino acids (AAAs), including tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. In addition, an LPHC diet elevated the serum concentrations of bile acids (BAs), particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and taurine. Collectively, our current findings point to the potential mechanism of administering an LPHC diet in attenuating movement impairments in MPTP-induced PD mice, with AAAs, microbial metabolites (TUDCA and taurine), and FGF-21 as key mediators along the gut-microbiota-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "Overconsumption of highly refined carbohydrates contributes significantly to the current obesity pandemics. Probiotic administration protects against weight gain in animals fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Nonetheless, the anti-obesity effects of probiotics in a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD)-induced obesity models are not well elucidated. Herein, C57BL/6N male mice were fed an HCD (70% kcal carbohydrate) for 12 weeks and were orally treated with multi-strain probiotics (MSPs) at 1010 CFU or saline every day for 6 weeks. MSPs contained Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 24936, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DSM 24937, and Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 25175. MSPs treatment not only ameliorated weight gain but also modulated the body fat composition altered by HCD. The MSPs also attenuated the expression of adipogenesis- and lipogenesis-related genes in HCD-fed mice. In addition, MSPs promoted the expression of lipolysis- and fatty acid oxidation-promoting factors in HCD-fed mice. Furthermore, MSPs modulated the expression of thermogenesis-related genes and the serum levels of obesity-related hormones altered by HCD. Treatment with MSPs positively reversed the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, which is associated with a risk of obesity. Hence, this study explores the multifaceted anti-obesity mechanisms of MSPs and highlights their potential to be used as effective weight-management products.",

It has also been reported that the combined effect of incretin modulators and SGLT2i is useful in improving blood glucose and reducing blood glucose variability. However, there have been no reports examining the effects of these two drugs together and while considering carbohydrate intake in an outpatient setting. In the present study, Hi-Speed Food Analysis was used to assess the exact intake of carbohydrates, and the glucose-lowering effects of luseogliflozin, an SGLT2i, and incretin modulators were examined under high- and low-carbohydrate intakes. Methods Thirty-five enrolled diabetic patients continued their regular medications for one week. All patients took luseogliflozin in the second week for seven days. During the two weeks, ingested carbohydrates were accurately calculated by Hi-Speed Food Analysis. The glucose-lowering effect of luseogliflozin with and without incretin modulators was checked according to the amount of ingested carbohydrates. A general linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the effect of luseogliflozin with or without an incretin modulator, with carbohydrate intake as a confounding factor. Results Luseogliflozin had an additive effect in patients who had taken the incretin modulator. There was a significant decrease in the time above range (TAR) with glucose above 140 mg/dL as expressed as TAR(min140), and this effect was affected by carbohydrate intake. Conclusions The glucose-lowering effect of luseogliflozin was enhanced with high-carbohydrate intake more than with low-carbohydrate intake. In this study, the observed number was small; however, combined treatment with an incretin modulator and luseogliflozin had an additive effect in high- versus low-carbohydrate intake, indicating the possible effectiveness of the combined therapy."

In this cross-over intervention trial, we investigated the effect of adherence to a low carbohydrate, high fat (LCHF) diet versus a high carbohydrate (HC) diet on gross efficiency (GE) and (OC) during exercise, both after 2 days and after 14 days of adherence. METHODS: Fourteen recreational male athletes followed a two-week LCHF diet (<10 energy % carbohydrate) and a two-week HC diet (>50 energy % carbohydrate), in random order, with a wash-out period of three weeks in between. After 2 and 14 days on each diet, the athletes performed a 90-minutes submaximal exercise session on a bicycle ergometer. Indirect calorimetry measurements were done after 60 minutes of exercise to calculate GE and OC. RESULTS: GE was significantly lower on the LCHF diet compared to the HC diet, after 2 days (17.6±1.9 vs. 18.8±1.2%, P=0.011, for the LCHF and HC diet respectively), not after 14 days. OC was significantly higher on the LCHF diet compared to the HC diet, after 2 days (1191±138 vs. 1087±72 mL O<inf>2</inf>/kCal, P=0.003, for the LCHF and HC diet respectively), and showed a strong tendency to remain higher after 14 days, P=0.018. CONCLUSIONS: Although LCHF diets are popular strategies to increase fat oxidation during exercise, adherence to a LCHF diet was associated with a lower exercise efficiency and economy compared to a HC diet.",

      "abstract": "Carbohydrates are widely distributed in nature as an important nutritional substance and energy source. However, the utilization efficiency of carbohydrates is very poor in fish. Over consumption of carbohydrates will cause excessive inflammatory response and result in lower pathogen resistance in fish. Probiotics have been widely used to prevent inflammation, but the underlying mechanism still needs more exploration. In this study, three diets, including a control diet (CD), a high-carbohydrate diet (HD) and the HD supplemented with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SS1 (HDB) were used to feed Nile tilapia for 10 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) for 7 days. The data showed that the addition of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SS1 (B. amyloliquefaciens SS1) significantly increased the survival rate and enhanced the respiratory burst activity of head kidney leukocytes in Nile tilapia. B. amyloliquefaciens SS1 treatment significantly elevated the anti-oxidative capability, which was evidenced by higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and higher content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the serum. Administration with B. amyloliquefaciens SS1 effectively suppressed inflammatory response in the liver by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)/interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) inflammatory signaling pathway. In vitro analysis suggested that intestinal bacteria derived-acetate has the antioxidant capability, which may account for the alleviation of inflammation. Overall, this study demonstrated that dietary supplementation with B. amyloliquefaciens SS1 protected Nile Tilapia against A. hydrophila infection and suppressed liver inflammation by enhancing antioxidant capability.",

      "abstract": "Studies using mouse models of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) have demonstrated a variety of relationships between dietary macronutrients on antibiotic-associated CDI; however, few of these effects have been examined in more susceptible hamster models of CDI. In this study, we investigated the effect of a high-carbohydrate diet previously shown to protect mice from CDI on the progression and resolution of CDI in a hamster disease model, with 10 animals per group. Hamsters fed the high-carbohydrate diet developed distinct diet-specific microbiomes during antibiotic treatment and CDI, with lower diversity, persistent C. difficile carriage, and delayed microbiome restoration. In contrast to CDI protection in mice, most hamsters fed a high-carbohydrate diet developed fulminant CDI including several cases of late-onset CDI, that were not observed in hamsters fed a standard lab diet. We speculate that prolonged high-carbohydrate diet-specific dysbiosis in these animals allowed C. difficile to persist in the gut of the animals where they could proliferate postvancomycin treatment, leading to delayed CDI onset. This study, along with similar studies in mouse models of CDI, suggests some high-carbohydrate diets may promote antibiotic-associated dysbiosis and long-term C. difficile carriage, which may later convert to symptomatic CDI. IMPORTANCE The effects of diet on CDI are not completely known. Here, we used a high-carbohydrate diet previously shown to protect mice against CDI to assess its effect on a hamster model of CDI and paradoxically found that it promoted dysbiosis, C. difficile carriage, and higher mortality. A common thread in both mouse and hamster experimental models was that the high-carbohydrate diet promoted dysbiosis and long-term carriage of C. difficile, which may have converted to fulminant CDI only in the highly susceptible hamster model system. If diets high in carbohydrates also promote dysbiosis and C. difficile carriage in humans, then these diets might paradoxically increase chances of CDI relapse despite their protective effects against primary CDI.",

      "abstract": "Yinchenhao Decoction (YD), a Chinese herbal medicine, has been traditionally used for treatment of metabolic liver diseases. A 10-week feeding trail was carried out to examine the effects of YD supplementation in a high carbohydrate diet (HCD) on liver histopathology, immune response, disease resistance, and expression of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, apoptosis, necroptosis and inflammation in juvenile largemouth. A diet containing 9% carbohydrate was used as a low carbohydrate diet (LCD), and a HCD was formulated to contain 18% carbohydrate and supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1, 2 or 4% YD (HCD, HCD+0.5YD, HCD+1YD, HCD+2YD and HCD+4YD). Triplicate groups of fish (5.6 ± 0.2 g) were feed the test diets to visual satiety for 10 weeks. The highest survival rate after Nocardia seriolae challenge was recorded for the HCD+4YD group. YD application led to reduced ACP, AKP, AST and ALT activities. HCD-induced cells swelling, ruptured cell membrane, migrated nuclei and increasing inflammatory cells in hepatocytes were mitigated by YD addition. Moreover, YD decreased the expressions of pro-inflammation genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, hepcidin1, NF-κB, COX2, CD80 and CD83) and increased the mRNA levels of anti-inflammation genes (IL-10 and IKBα). The mode of liver cell death was preferably changed to programed apoptosis rather than uncontrolled necroptosis by application of YD in HCD. Furthermore, the expression of UPR genes (IRE1, Eif2α, ATF6, XBP1 and GRP78/Bip) and autophagy genes (LC3-2, BNIP3 and P62) was increased by YD supplementation. In summary, our results demonstrated that YD addition in HCD enhances UPR, autophagy and programed apoptosis maintaining the homeostasis, and decreases uncontrolled necroptosis and inflammation, ultimately leading to improved immune response in largemouth bass.",

      "abstract": "We implemented a multi-pronged strategy (MAX) involving chronic (2 weeks high carbohydrate [CHO] diet + gut-training) and acute (CHO loading + 90 g·h−1 CHO during exercise) strategies to promote endogenous and exogenous CHO availability, compared with strategies reflecting lower ranges of current guidelines (CON) in two groups of athletes. Nineteen elite male race walkers (MAX: 9; CON:10) undertook a 26 km race-walking session before and after the respective interventions to investigate gastrointestinal function (absorption capacity), integrity (epithelial injury), and symptoms (GIS). We observed considerable individual variability in responses, resulting in a statistically significant (p < 0.001) yet likely clinically insignificant increase (Δ 736 pg·mL−1) in I-FABP after exercise across all trials, with no significant differences in breath H2 across exercise (p = 0.970). MAX was associated with increased GIS in the second half of the exercise, especially in upper GIS (p < 0.01). Eighteen highly trained male and female distance runners (MAX: 10; CON: 8) then completed a 35 km run (28 km steady-state + 7 km time-trial) supported by either a slightly modified MAX or CON strategy. Inter-individual variability was observed, without major differences in epithelial cell intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) or GIS, due to exercise, trial, or group, despite the 3-fold increase in exercise CHO intake in MAX post-intervention. The tight-junction (claudin-3) response decreased in both groups from pre- to post-intervention. Groups achieved a similar performance improvement from pre- to post-intervention (CON = 39 s [95 CI 15−63 s]; MAX = 36 s [13−59 s]; p = 0.002). Although this suggests that further increases in CHO availability above current guidelines do not confer additional advantages, limitations in our study execution (e.g., confounding loss of BM in several individuals despite a live-in training camp environment and significant increases in aerobic capacity due to intensified training) may have masked small differences. Therefore, athletes should meet the minimum CHO guidelines for training and competition goals, noting that, with practice, increased CHO intake can be tolerated, and may contribute to performance outcomes.",

Therefore, multiple strategies to achieve a substantial weight loss before surgery are needed in obese patients. The aim of the study was to test the effect of a fiber-enriched high carbohydrate (FEHC) diet on the reduction in body weight and pain in elderly obese patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). Sixty-one candidates for THA were included in our study. Prior to the procedure, the participants have been randomly assigned to a 3-month diet intervention (FEHC diet or free diet). Anthropometric measures and food questionnaires were collected at the enrollment and after 3 months. The Oxford Hip Score (OHS), the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) and the Western Ontario McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC) were administered at baseline and before surgery. A statistically significant variation of weight was found in the FEHC diet group (-3.7 kg, -4.4--2.5) compared to the control group (-0.2 kg; -1.4-1.7; p < 0.0001), as well as significant improvements in the OHS (p < 0.0001), the HOOS (p < 0.0001) and the WOMAC (p < 0.0001) questionnaires. According to the results of the study, the FEHC diet in obese patients undergoing THA might help weight loss and improve related anthropometric parameters as well as hip function and pain."

First, the mice were divided into five groups (n = 6/group) as follows: normal diet, HCD, and HCD+EAT (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day), which were orally administered with EAT daily for 84 days. Using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis, we found that EAT inhibited not only body-weight gain, but also visceral fat and subcutaneous fat accumulation. Histological analysis confirmed that EAT decreased the size of fat tissues. EAT consistently improved various indices, including plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, atherogenic index, and cardiac risk factors, which are related to dyslipidemia-a major risk factor for heart disease. The contents of TC and TG, as well as the lipid droplets of HCD-induced hepatic accumulation in the liver tissue, were suppressed by EAT. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of developing EAT as a therapeutic agent for improving HCD-induced obesity and hyperlipidemia.",

      "abstract": "Low carbohydrate, high fat (LCHF) diets are followed by athletes, but questions remain regarding effects of LCHF on metabolic adaptation, exercise-induced stress, immune function and their time-course. In this cross-over study, 14 recreational male athletes (32.9 ± 8.2 years, VO2max 57.3 ± 5.8 mL/kg/min) followed a two week LCHF diet (<10 En% carbohydrates (CHO), ~75En% Fat) and a two week HC diet (>50 En% CHO), in random order, with a wash-out period of >2 weeks in between. After 2 days and 2 weeks on either diet, participants performed cycle ergometry for 90 min at 60%Wmax. Blood samples for analysis of cortisol, free fatty acids (FFA), glucose and ketones, and saliva samples for immunoglobin A (s-IgA) were collected at different time points before and after exercise. The LCHF diet resulted in higher FFA, higher ketones and lower glucose levels compared to the HC diet (p < 0.05). Exercise-induced cortisol response was higher after 2 days on the LCHF diet (822 ± 215 nmol/L) compared to 2 weeks on the LCHF diet (669 ± 243 nmol/L, p = 0.004) and compared to both test days following the HC diet (609 ± 208 and 555 ± 173 nmol/L, both p < 0.001). Workload was lower, and perceived exertion higher, on the LCHF diet compared to the HC diet on both occasions. A drop in s-IgA following exercise was not seen after 2 days on the LCHF diet, in contrast to the HC diet. In conclusion, the LCHF diet resulted in reduced workload with metabolic effects and a pronounced exercise-induced cortisol response after 2 days. Although indications of adaptation were seen after 2 weeks on the LCHF diet, work output was still lower.",

      "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI) can result from the disruption of the resident gut microbiota. Western diets and popular weight-loss diets drive large changes in the gut microbiome; however, the literature is conflicted with regard to the effect of diet on CDI. Using the hypervirulent strain C. difficile R20291 (RT027) in a mouse model of antibiotic-induced CDI, we assessed disease outcome and microbial community dynamics in mice fed two high-fat diets in comparison with a high-carbohydrate diet and a standard rodent diet. The two high-fat diets exacerbated CDI, with a high-fat/high-protein, Atkins-like diet leading to severe CDI and 100% mortality and a high-fat/low-protein, medium-chain-triglyceride (MCT)-like diet inducing highly variable CDI outcomes. In contrast, mice fed a high-carbohydrate diet were protected from CDI, despite the high levels of refined carbohydrate and low levels of fiber in the diet. A total of 28 members of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae decreased in abundance due to diet and/or antibiotic treatment; these organisms may compete with C. difficile for amino acids and protect healthy animals from CDI in the absence of antibiotics. Together, these data suggest that antibiotic treatment might lead to loss of C. difficile competitors and create a favorable environment for C. difficile proliferation and virulence with effects that are intensified by high-fat/high-protein diets; in contrast, high-carbohydrate diets might be protective regardless of the source of carbohydrate or of antibiotic-driven loss of C. difficile competitors.IMPORTANCE The role of Western and weight-loss diets with extreme macronutrient composition in the risk and progression of CDI is poorly understood. In a longitudinal study, we showed that a high-fat/high-protein, Atkins-type diet greatly exacerbated antibiotic-induced CDI, whereas a high-carbohydrate diet protected, despite the high monosaccharide and starch content. Our study results, therefore, suggest that popular high-fat/high-protein weight-loss diets may enhance CDI risk during antibiotic treatment, possibly due to the synergistic effects of a loss of the microorganisms that normally inhibit C. difficile overgrowth and an abundance of amino acids that promote C. difficile overgrowth. In contrast, a high-carbohydrate diet might be protective, despite reports on the recent evolution of enhanced carbohydrate metabolism in C. difficile."

Contrary to control diet, HCD induces several metabolic disorders including increased adiposity, dyslipidemia, ectopic fat deposition in the liver, associated with higher levels of plasma AST and ALT. These gerbils showed enhanced oxidative stress with liver damages characteristic of steatohepatitis development. By contrast, adding 20E to HCD resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of all changes induced by HCD. In addition, the hepatoprotective effect of 20E was demonstrated by decreased plasma concentrations of AST, ALT and of hepatic malondialdehyde. Our results suggest that G. tarabuli represents a good model to study diet-induced metabolic disorders and hepatic dysfunctions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized crossover study with two 12-week intervention arms separated by a 12-week washout, 14 participants using sensor-augmented insulin pumps were included. Individual meal plans meeting the carbohydrate criteria were made for each study participant. Actual carbohydrate intake was entered into the insulin pumps throughout the study. RESULTS: Ten participants completed the study. Daily carbohydrate intake during the two intervention periods was (mean ± standard deviation) 98 ± 11 g and 246 ± 34 g, respectively. Time spent in the range 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (primary outcome) did not differ between groups (LCD 68.6 ± 8.9% vs. HCD 65.3 ± 6.5%, P = 0.316). However, time spent <3.9 mmol/L was less (1.9 vs. 3.6%, P < 0.001) and glycaemic variability (assessed by coefficient of variation) was lower (32.7 vs. 37.5%, P = 0.013) during LCD. No events of severe hypoglycaemia were reported. Participants lost 2.0 ± 2.1 kg during LCD and gained 2.6 ± 1.8 kg during HCD (P = 0.001). No other cardiovascular risk factors, including fasting levels of lipids and inflammatory markers, were significantly affected. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an intake of 250 g of carbohydrate per day, restriction of carbohydrate intake to 100 g per day in adults with type 1 diabetes reduced time spent in hypoglycaemia, glycaemic variability and weight with no effect on cardiovascular risk factors.",

Here, we used C. elegans as the model organism to investigate it. We starved the worms for 24 h or fed them with glucose since hatching, and then measured their learning ability at L4 stage using mechanosensory stimulation assay. The results showed that the learning ability was significantly decreased by starvation, while could be gradually recovered after 3 h normal feeding. After glucose treatment, the length-width ratio of worm was reduced and the learning ability was also significantly decreased. Interestingly, this effect could be passed down two generations probably through epigenetic inheritance. To understand the mechanism of these effects, age-1 and mec-3 mutants were used and they affected the learning ability differently under normal or adverse conditions. Therefore, we concluded that starvation and high-carbohydrate diet could modulate the learning ability of C. elegans, and they were regulated by different gene networks."

      "abstract": "Ligularia fischeri, indigenous to eastern Asia, has been used as a traditional herbal medicine. Ligularia fischeri reportedly possesses a number of biological activities such as antimutagenic, antioxidant, antigenotoxic, and anti-inflammation. This study demonstrated the effects of ethanol extracts of Ligularia fischeri (ELF) on a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD)-induced hyperlipidemia in C57BL/6 mice. The mice were divided into six groups (n = 7/group) as follows: normal diet, HCD, or HCD+ELF (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day), which were orally administered daily for 12 weeks. Various lipid parameters and histological changes in liver and fat tissue were compared among the treatment and control groups. ELF remarkably reduced body weight gain and attenuated hyperlipidemia by improving the plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, atherogenic index, and cardiac risk factor. Moreover, ELF decreased the HCD-induced hepatic accumulation of lipid droplets and adipocyte hypertrophy. These regulatory effects of ELF appeared to be mediated through the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, and expression of fatty acid synthase. Taken together, these findings indicate a functional role for ELF in the regulation of HCD-induced obesity and hyperlipidemia.",

A periodized (p) LPHC regimen would be a more practical long-term human lifestyle intervention, but the metabolic benefits of pLPHC are not known. Also, the interactions between LPHC diet and exercise training have not been investigated. Presently, we aimed to provide proof-of-concept data in mice of the efficacy of pLPHC and to explore the potential interactions with concurrent exercise training. METHODS: A detailed phenotypic and molecular characterization of mice undergoing different durations of 14 d LPHC (5 E% protein)/14 d control diet cycles for up to 4 months with or without concurrent access to activity wheels allowing voluntary exercise training. RESULTS: pLPHC conferred metabolic benefits similar to chronic LPHC, including increased FGF21 and adaptive thermogenesis, obesity-protection despite increased total energy intake and improved insulin sensitivity. The improved insulin sensitivity showed large fluctuations between diet periods and was lost within 14 days of switching back to control diet. Parallel exercise training improved weight maintenance but impaired the FGF21 response to pLPHC whereas repeated pLPHC cycles progressively augmented this response. Both the FGF21 suppression by exercise and potentiation by repeated cycles correlated tightly with Nupr1 mRNA in liver, suggesting dependence on liver integrated stress response. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pLPHC may be a viable strategy to promote human health but also highlight the transient nature of the benefits and that the interaction with other lifestyle-interventions such as exercise training warrants consideration.",

This opens new opportunities to reconsider and redevelop vaccine strategies to prime an anticancer immune response. Combination of such vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors will both provide the fuel and release the brake for an efficient anticancer response. Here, we discuss vaccine strategies that use C-type lectin receptor (CLR) targeting of APCs, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. APCs are a necessity for the priming of antigen-specific cytotoxic and helper T cells. Because CLRs are natural carbohydrate-recognition receptors highly expressed by multiple subsets of APCs and involved in uptake and processing of Ags for presentation, these receptors seem particularly interesting for targeting purposes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Remission of pre-diabetes to normal is an important health concern which has had little success in the past. This study objective was to determine the effect on remission of pre-diabetes with a high protein (HP) versus high carbohydrate (HC) diet and effects on metabolic parameters, lean and fat body mass in prediabetic, obese subjects after 6 months of dietary intervention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited and randomized 24 pre-diabetes women and men to either a HP (30% protein, 30% fat, 40% carbohydrate; n=12) or HC (15% protein, 30% fat, 55% carbohydrate; n=12) diet feeding study for 6 months in this randomized controlled trial. All meals were provided to subjects for 6 months with daily food menus for HP or HC compliance with weekly food pick-up and weight measurements. At baseline and after 6 months on the respective diets oral glucose tolerance and meal tolerance tests were performed with glucose and insulin measurements and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans. RESULTS: After 6 months on the HP diet, 100% of the subjects had remission of their pre-diabetes to normal glucose tolerance, whereas only 33.3% of subjects on the HC diet had remission of their pre-diabetes. The HP diet group exhibited significant improvement in (1) insulin sensitivity (p=0.001), (2) cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.04), (3) inflammatory cytokines (p=0.001), (4) oxidative stress (p=0.001), (5) increased percent lean body mass (p=0.001) compared with the HC diet at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first dietary intervention feeding study, to the best of our knowledge, to report 100% remission of pre-diabetes with a HP diet and significant improvement in metabolic parameters and anti-inflammatory effects compared with a HC diet at 6 months.

Metabolome profiling in patients and animal models may identify affected metabolic pathways and reveal new biomarkers of disease progression. Using liver metabolomics we have shown a starvation-like condition in a knock-in (Bcs1lc.232A>G) mouse model of GRACILE syndrome, a neonatal lethal respiratory chain complex III dysfunction with hepatopathy. Here, we hypothesized that a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD, 60% dextrose) will alleviate the hypoglycemia and promote survival of the sick mice. However, when fed HCD the homozygotes had shorter survival (mean ± SD, 29 ± 2.5 days, n = 21) than those on standard diet (33 ± 3.8 days, n = 30), and no improvement in hypoglycemia or liver glycogen depletion. We investigated the plasma metabolome of the HCD- and control diet-fed mice and found that several amino acids and urea cycle intermediates were increased, and arginine, carnitines, succinate, and purine catabolites decreased in the homozygotes. Despite reduced survival the increase in aromatic amino acids, an indicator of liver mitochondrial dysfunction, was normalized on HCD. Quantitative enrichment analysis revealed that glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, and urea cycle were also partly normalized on HCD. This dietary intervention revealed an unexpected adverse effect of high-glucose diet in complex III deficiency, and suggests that plasma metabolomics is a valuable tool in evaluation of therapies in mitochondrial disorders.",

Body weight, blood pressure, and renal function assessed by eGFR, estimated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault, Salazar-Corcoran) and albumin excretion rate (AER), were measured pre- and post-intervention.Both groups achieved similar completion rates (LC 71%, HC 65%) and reductions in weight (mean [95% CI]; -9.3 [-10.6, -8.0] kg) and blood pressure (-6 [-9, -4]/-6[-8, -5] mmHg), P ≥ 0.18. Protein intake calculated from 24 hours urinary urea was higher in the LC than HC group (LC 120.1 ± 38.2 g/day, 1.3 g/kg/day; HC 95.8 ± 27.8 g/day, 1 g/kg/day), P < 0.001 diet effect. Changes in SCr (LC 3 [1, 5], HC 1 [-1, 3] μmol/L) and eGFR (LC -4 [-6, -2], HC -2 [-3, 0] mL/min/1.73 m) did not differ between diets (P = 0.25). AER decreased independent of diet composition (LC --2.4 [-6, 1.2], HC -1.8 [-5.4, 1.8] mg/24 h, P = 0.24); 6 participants (LC 3, HC 3) had moderately elevated AER at baseline (30-300 mg/24 h), which normalized in 4 participants (LC 2, HC 2) after 52 weeks.Compared with a traditional HC weight loss diet, consumption of an LC high protein diet does not adversely affect clinical markers of renal function in obese adults with T2DM and no preexisting kidney disease.",

METHODS: Twenty non-obese young men (age 22.7 ± 2.6 years, BMI 23.5 ± 2.1 kg/m(2)) completed the study. Two DXA tests were performed for the measurement of total body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage as well as total, appendicular and central lean body mass (LBM) before and after a high-carbohydrate diet for 3 days. In addition, the participants completed a food diary during the 3-day high-carbohydrate diet to determine the mean percentage of carbohydrates consumed from total kilocalories. RESULTS: The mean percentage of carbohydrate intake over 3 days was 83.7 ± 8.4%. Our results showed a significant increase in total body weight, BMI as well as total and appendicular LBM after the high-carbohydrate diet (p < 0.01). In addition, we observed a strong tendency for lower body fat percentage values after the intervention (p = 0.05). No significant difference was observed for central LBM. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the effect of an acute high carbohydrate diet seems to affect body composition values using DXA, such as total LBM. This study may lead to the need of standardizing a diet prior to using DXA.",

METHODS: We randomly assigned 102 participants (age 21-76 years and BMI 19.2-35.5 kg/m(2)) to the three different diets for 6 weeks in a parallel design intervention trial. All foods were provided. Ninety-three participants completed all study procedures; 92 were included in the analyses. Endpoints included plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II (sTNFRI and II), and adiponectin. RESULTS: In the unadjusted primary analyses, none of the endpoints were differentially affected by the dietary interventions despite the significantly greater reductions in body weight and fat mass in participants consuming the low-calorie low-fat diet compared to the eucaloric diets (p < 0.001). When including weight change in the model in secondary analysis, adiponectin tended to be increased with weight loss (time × weight change interaction, p = 0.051). Adjusted for weight change, adiponectin was reduced in the groups consuming the low-fat diets relative to the moderate-fat diet (p = 0.008). No effect of the intervention diets or weight loss on CRP, IL-6, or sTNFRI and II was seen in these secondary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In relatively healthy adults, moderate weight loss had minimal effects on systemic inflammation, and raised plasma adiponectin only modestly. A lower dietary fat and higher carbohydrate content had little impact on measures of systemic inflammation, but reduced adiponectin concentrations compared to a moderate-fat diet. The latter may be of concern given the consistent and strong inverse association of plasma adiponectin with many chronic diseases.",

The design of the present study included varying lengths of exenatide exposure (3, 6 weeks to 12 weeks) at multiple concentrations (3, 10, or 30 µg/kg) with multiple endpoints (histopathology evaluations, immunoassay for cytokines, immunostaining of the pancreas, serum chemistries and measurement of trypsin, amylase, and, lipase, and gene expression profiles). Time- and dose-dependent exocrine pancreatic injury was observed in mice on a high fat diet treated with exenatide. The morphological changes identified in the pancreas involved acinar cell injury and death (autophagy, apoptosis, necrosis, and atrophy), cell adaptations (hypertrophy and hyperplasia), and cell survival (proliferation/regeneration) accompanied by varying degrees of inflammatory response leading to secondary injury in pancreatic blood vessels, ducts, and adipose tissues. Gene expression profiles indicated increased signaling for cell survival and altered lipid metabolism in exenatide treated mice. Immunohistochemistry supported gene expression findings that exenatide caused and/or exacerbated pancreatic injury in a high fat diet environment potentially by further increasing high fat diet exacerbated lipid metabolism and resulting oxidative stress. Further investigation is required to confirm these findings and determine their relevance to human disease.",

      "abstract": "Early life nutritional intervention causes adult-onset insulin resistance and obesity in rats. Thyroid hormone receptor (TR), in turn, transcriptionally enhances skeletal muscle Glut4 expression. We tested the hypothesis that reduced circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone and T4 concentrations encountered in postnatal (PN4-PN24) high-carbohydrate (HC) milk formula-fed versus the mother-fed controls (MF) would epigenetically interfere with TR induction of adult (100 days) male rat skeletal muscle Glut4 expression, thereby providing a molecular mechanism mediating insulin resistance. We observed increased DNA methylation of the CpG island with enhanced recruitment of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and MeCP2 in the glut4 promoter region along with reduced acetylation of histone (H)2A.Z and H4 particularly at the H4.lysine (K)16 residue, which was predominantly mediated by histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). This was followed by enhanced recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1β to the glut4 promoter with increased Suv39H1 methylase concentrations. These changes reduced TR binding of the T3 response element of the glut4 gene (TREs; -473 to -450 bp) detected qualitatively in vivo (electromobility shift assay) and quantified ex vivo (chromatin immunoprecipitation). In addition, the recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator and CREB-binding protein to the glut4 promoter-protein complex was reduced. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between TR and CBP to be reduced and HDAC4 to be enhanced in HC versus MF groups. These molecular changes were associated with diminished skeletal muscle Glut4 mRNA and protein concentrations. We conclude that early postnatal exposure to HC diet epigenetically reduced TR induction of adult male skeletal muscle Glut4 expression, uncovering novel molecular mechanisms contributing to adult insulin resistance and obesity.",

As a result, this study was to investigate the effects of this polymorphism on changes of the ratios induced by a high-carbohydrate (high-CHO) diet. METHODS: After a washout diet of 54% carbohydrate for 7 days, 56 healthy young adults (22.89 +/- 1.80 years old) were given the high-CHO diet of 70% carbohydrate for 6 days. Height, weight, waist circumference (WC), glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo) AI, and apoB100 at baseline and before and after the high-CHO diet were measured. Body mass index (BMI), TG/HDL-C, log (TG/HDL-C), TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and apoB100/apoAI were calculated. PPARgamma C161T was detected by a PCR-RFLP method. The relationship between the polymorphism and the ratios were analyzed. RESULTS: The female T carriers had higher BMI and WC than the female CC homozygotes at baseline and before and after the diet, higher glucose, TG/HDL-C and log (TG/HDL-C) before the diet. In males, when compared to the T carriers, the CC homozygotes had higher TG/HDL-C, log (TG/HDL-C) and apoB100/apoAI at baseline and before and after the diet, higher glucose at baseline, higher LDL-C/HDL-C and TC/HDL-C before and after the diet. Compared with those before the high-CHO diet, TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C decreased after the diet regardless of gender and the genotypes. Decreased BMI and WC were observed in the male CC homozygotes but only decreased BMI in the female T carriers. Notably, decreased apoB100/apoAI was observed in the male T carriers, while elevated TG/HDL-C and log (TG/HDL-C) in the female CC homozygotes, and reduced glucose in the female T carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the interplay of gender, the PPARgamma C161T polymorphism and the high-CHO diet can change not only the ratios of plasma lipids and apolipoproteins but also the association of the ratios with plasma glucose, WC, and BMI in healthy Chinese young adults. Once confirmed by larger sample size and multi-center trials, the findings will provide a new scientific basis for personalized dietary intervention for the subjects with different PPARgamma C161T genotypes to reduce risks of CAD, especially in a country with a quarter of the world's population.",

      "abstract": "Liver steatosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is affected by genetics and diet. It is associated with insulin resistance (IR) in hepatic and peripheral tissues. Here, we aimed to characterize the severity of diet-induced steatosis, obesity, and IR in two phylogenetically distant mouse strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. To this end, mice (male, 8 wk old) were fed a high-fat and high-carbohydrate (HFHC) or control diet for 16 wk followed by the application of a combination of classic physiological, biochemical, and pathological studies to determine obesity and hepatic steatosis. Peripheral IR was characterized by measuring blood glucose level, serum insulin level, homeostasis model assessment of IR, glucose intolerance, insulin intolerance, and AKT phosphorylation in adipose tissues, whereas the level of hepatic IR was determined by measuring insulin-triggered hepatic AKT phosphorylation. We discovered that both C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice developed obesity to a similar degree without the feature of liver inflammation after being fed an HFHC diet for 16 wk. C57BL/6J mice in the HFHC diet group exhibited severe pan-lobular steatosis, a marked increase in hepatic triglyceride levels, and profound peripheral IR. In contrast, DBA/2J mice in the HFHC diet group developed only a mild degree of pericentrilobular hepatic steatosis that was associated with moderate changes in peripheral IR. Interestingly, both C57BL/6J and DBA/2J developed severe hepatic IR after HFHC diet treatment. Collectively, these data suggest that the severity of diet-induced hepatic steatosis is correlated to the level of peripheral IR, not with the severity of obesity and hepatic IR. Peripheral rather than hepatic IR is a dominant factor of pathophysiology in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common hepatic disease worldwide, and evidence suggests that it promotes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Caloric restriction (CR) is the only available strategy for NAFLD treatment. The protein deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), which is activated by CR, increases catabolic metabolism and decreases lipogenesis and inflammation, both involved in the development of NAFLD. Here we show that adeno-associated viral vectors of serotype 8 (AAV8)-mediated liver-specific Sirt1 gene transfer prevents the development of NAFLD induced by a high carbohydrate (HC) diet. Long-term hepatic SIRT1 overexpression led to upregulation of key hepatic genes involved in β-oxidation, prevented HC diet-induced lipid accumulation and reduced liver inflammation. AAV8-Sirt1-treated mice showed improved insulin sensitivity, increased oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle and reduced white adipose tissue inflammation. Moreover, HC feeding induced leptin resistance, which was also attenuated in AAV8-Sirt1-treated mice. Therefore, AAV-mediated gene transfer to overexpress SIRT1 specifically in the liver may represent a new gene therapy strategy to counteract NAFLD and related diseases such as type 2 diabetes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation is pivotal in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK) 3 is one of the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) that mediates JNK activation in the liver. Despite this concept, the role of MLK3 in modulating liver injury during nutrient excess has not been explored. Our aim was to determine if MLK3 deficient mice were protected against high fat high carbohydrate (HFHC) diet-induced NASH. METHODS: We employed eight-week-old Mlk3(-/-) male C57BL/6J mice, and wild type (WT) mice C57BL/6J as controls. Mice were fed a HFHC or a chow diet adlib for 16 weeks. RESULTS: Hepatic JNK activating phosphorylation was readily absent in the Mlk3(-/-) mice fed the HFHC diet, but not in WT mice. This inhibition of JNK activation was hepatoprotective. Despite a comparable increase in weight gain, hepatic steatosis by histological examination and hepatic triglyceride quantification was reduced in HFHC diet-fed Mlk3(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. In addition, compared with the WT mice, HFHC diet-fed Mlk3(-/-) mice had significantly attenuated liver injury as manifested by reduced ALT levels, hepatocyte apoptosis, markers of hepatic inflammation and indices of hepatic fibrogenesis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that loss of MLK3 in mice is protective against HFHC diet-induced NASH, in a weight-independent fashion, through attenuation of JNK activation. MLK3 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human NASH.",

In this study, we examined the effect of caffeine treatment on chronic stress- and/or high fat-high carbohydrate Western diet (WD)-induced impairment of learning and memory in rats. Chronic psychosocial stress, WD and caffeine (0.3 g/L in drinking water) were simultaneously administered for 3 months to adult male Wistar rats. At the conclusion of the 3 months, and while the previous treatments continued, rats were tested in the radial arm water maze (RAWM) for learning, short-term and long-term memory. This procedure was applied on a daily basis to all animals for 5 consecutive days or until the animal reaches days to criterion (DTC) in the 12th learning trial and memory tests. DTC is the number of days that the animal takes to make zero error in two consecutive days. Chronic stress and/or WD groups caused impaired learning, which was prevented by chronic caffeine administration. In the memory tests, chronic caffeine administration also prevented memory impairment during chronic stress conditions and/or WD. Furthermore, DTC value for caffeine treated stress, WD, and stress/WD groups indicated that caffeine normalizes memory impairment in these groups. These results showed that chronic caffeine administration prevented stress and/or WD-induced impairment of spatial learning and memory.",

We assessed the effects of isoenergetic diets with different fat quantity and quality on the incidence and regression of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) from the LIPGENE project. METHODS AND DESIGN: Clinical intervention study: the patients (n=337) were randomly assigned to one of four diets for 12 weeks each: two high fat diets, one rich in saturated fat (HSFA) and the other rich in monounsaturated fat (HMUFA), and two low fat diets, one high in complex carbohydrates (LFHCC) supplemented with 1.24g/day of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LFHCC n-3) and the other LFHCC diet with placebo (LFHCC). MEASUREMENTS: the effects on MetS risk criteria were recorded before and after the intervention period. RESULTS: An enlarged waist circumference (≥88cm for women and ≥102cm for men) was present among 95% of the participants, 88% had elevated blood pressure (>130/85mm Hg or antihypertensive drugs), 77% had elevated fasting plasma glucose (≥5.55mmol/L), 51% were hypertriacylglycerolemic (≥1.7mmol/L), and 72% had low HDL cholesterol (<1.0mmol/L for men, and <1.3mmol/L for women). The prevalence of enlarged waist circumference, hypertension and hypertriacylglycerolemia were reduced after the LFHCC n-3 diet (p<0.05). Thus the prevalence of MetS fell by 20.5% after LFHCC n-3 diet compared with the HSFA (10.6%), HMUFA (12%) diet or LFHCC (10.4%) diets (p<0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of a low-fat high-carbohydrate supplemented with n-3 diet reduced the risk of MetS as compared with isoenergetic high-fat (HSFA and HMUFA) and LFHCC diets.",

Therefore, 2 polymorphisms, i.e. APOA5-1131T>C and APOC3-482C>T, and serum lipids were examined in a Chinese healthy young population with high-carbohydrate/low-fat (HC/LF) diet intervention. METHODS: After a wash-out diet for 7 days, 56 young adults (22.89 ± 1.80 years) received the HC/LF diet for 6 days. Body mass index (BMI) and fasting serum lipid profiles at baseline, after the wash-out diet, and after the HC/LF diet were measured. RESULTS: APOA5-1131C carriers had higher triglyceride (TG) and TG-rich lipoprotein TG (TRL-TG) levels at baseline and after the HC/LF diet, though this mainly corresponded to the female cohort. APOC3-482T carriers had higher TRL-TG levels following the wash-out and HC/LF diets, but these were not directly attributable to a single gender.

Whether lipid-lowering properties of lupin protein will be influenced by thermal treatment or by other nutrients has not been elucidated. In a two-factorial study, rats were fed hypercholesterolemic diets based on high amounts of carbohydrates (HC) or fat (HF), which contained either (20.4% of energy) untreated or thermally treated lupin protein (steam: 120 °C, 30 min) or casein as control protein. Lupin protein lowered plasma lipid concentrations in rats fed the HF diet but not in those fed the HC diet (P<0.05). Among rats fed the HF diet, plasma and VLDL triglyceride concentrations were lower in rats fed thermally treated (-46% and -44%, P<0.05) and untreated lupin protein (-47% and -46%, P<0.05) than in those fed casein; whereas liver triglycerides were reduced only in rats fed untreated lupin protein (P<0.05). Compared to casein, untreated lupin protein had slightly stronger cholesterol-lowering effects in plasma, LDL and HDL (-34%, -37%, -35%; P<0.05) than thermally treated lupin protein (-23%, -29%, -31%, P<0.10). In conclusion, the lipid-lowering effect of lupin protein strongly depends on composition of the basal diet, and thermal treatment is accompanied by a slight reduction of its hypocholesterolemic properties.",

      "abstract": "Carnivorous fish species such as the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are considered to be \"glucose intolerant\" because of the prolonged hyperglycemia experienced after intake of a carbohydrate-enriched meal. In the present study, we use this species to study glucose homeostasis in fish chronically infused with the hypoglycemic agents, insulin, and metformin, and fed with a high proportion of carbohydrates (30%). We analyzed liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue (WAT), which are insulin- and metformin-specific targets at both the biochemical and molecular levels. Trout infused with the combination of insulin and metformin can effectively utilize dietary glucose at the liver, resulting in lowered glycemia, increased insulin sensitivity, and glucose storage capacity, combined with reduced glucose output. However, in both WAT and skeletal muscle, we observed decreased insulin sensitivity with the combined insulin + metformin treatment, resulting in the absence of changes at the metabolic level in the skeletal muscle and an increased potential for glucose uptake and storage in the WAT. Thus, the poor utilization by rainbow trout of a diet with a high proportion of carbohydrate can at least be partially improved by a combined treatment with insulin and metformin, and the glucose intolerance observed in this species could be, in part, due to some of the downstream components of the insulin and metformin signaling pathways. However, the predominant effects of metformin treatment on the action of insulin in these three tissues thought to be involved in glucose homeostasis remain exclusive in this species.",

Eight dams were randomised onto two test diets, and fed the diets throughout gestation and lactation. Male offspring were evaluated for 9 months. Kittens were weaned at 2 months of age onto the same treatment diet as the dam and were allowed to consume diets ad libitum. The HC diet contained 34.3 % crude protein (CP), 19.2 % fat and 30.8 % digestible carbohydrate, while the HP diet contained 52.9 % CP, 23.5 % fat and 10.8 % digestible carbohydrate. Blood samples were collected at 6 months after birth. Body composition was determined at 2 and 8 months of age and an intravenous glucose tolerance test, neutering and adipose tissue biopsy conducted at 8 months of age. Physical activity was quantified at 6 and 9 months. Energy intake, DM intake and body weight were not different between groups. At 2 months, blood TAG were greater (P < 0.05) in kittens fed the HP diet. At 8 months, blood leptin was higher (P < 0.05) in kittens fed the HC diet, while chemokine receptor 5, hormone-sensitive lipase, uncoupling protein 2, leptin and insulin receptor mRNA were greater (P < 0.05) in kittens fed the HP diet. The present results demonstrate some of the changes in blood metabolites and hormones, physical activity and mRNA abundance that occur with feeding high protein levels to kittens.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of high-monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and high-carbohydrate (CHO) diets on body weight and glycemic control in men and women with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight/obese participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 124, age = 56.5 +/- 0.8 years, BMI = 35.9 +/- 0.3 kg/m2, and A1C = 7.3 +/- 0.1%) were randomly assigned to 1 year of a high-MUFA or high-CHO diet. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 months of dieting. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. The overall retention rate for 1 year was 77% (69% for the high-MUFA group and 84% for the high-CHO group; P = 0.06). Based on food records, both groups had similar energy intake but a significant difference in MUFA intake. Both groups had similar weight loss over 1 year (-4.0 +/- 0.8 vs. -3.8 +/- 0.6 kg) and comparable improvement in body fat, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, A1C, and fasting glucose and insulin. There were no differences in these parameters between the groups. A follow-up assessment of a subset of participants (n = 36) was conducted 18 months after completion of the 52-week diet. These participants maintained their weight loss and A1C during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with type 2 diabetes, high-MUFA diets are an alternative to conventional lower-fat, high-CHO diets with comparable beneficial effects on body weight, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, and glycemic control.",

The underlying tissue-specific alterations in fatty acid metabolism are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: We investigated alterations in exogenous and endogenous fatty acid metabolism by using stable isotope tracers to label meal triacylglycerol and plasma fatty acids. DESIGN: Eight healthy subjects consumed isocaloric diets containing a high percentage of energy from carbohydrates or a higher percentage of energy from fat for 3 d in a randomized crossover dietary intervention study. A test meal containing [U-13C] palmitate was combined with intravenous infusion of [2H2] palmitate to label plasma fatty acids and VLDL triacylglycerol. Blood and breath samples were taken before the meal and for 6 h postprandially. Blood samples were drawn from the femoral artery and from veins draining subcutaneous adipose tissue and forearm muscle for monitoring of tissue-specific metabolic substrate partitioning. RESULTS: Systemic triacylglycerol concentrations were increased in both fasting (P = 0.02) and postprandial (P = 0.02) periods, and a greater amount of infused labeled fatty acid appeared in VLDL triacylglycerol after the HC diet than after the higher-fat diet (P = 0.05). Significantly less 13CO2 was exhaled after the HC diet (P = 0.04) and significantly less production of 13CO2 was seen across forearm muscle (P = 0.04). Systemic 3-hydroxybutyrate was significantly lower, postprandially, after the HC diet (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Metabolic alterations suggestive of repartitioning of fatty acids away from oxidation toward esterification in both liver and muscle occur in response to short-term adaptation to a HC diet.",

Dietary factors may at least partially influence breast cancer risk through an effect on the age at menopause. OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate (LFHC) dietary intervention on the timing of menopause in women with greater risk of breast cancer. DESIGN: The study population included participants from an LFHC dietary intervention trial for the prevention of breast cancer in women with extensive mammographic density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Women who were premenopausal at baseline (n = 2611) were followed for an average of 7 y for menopause. Survival analysis was used to compare the time to menopause between the LFHC and control groups and to assess other factors associated with age at menopause. RESULTS: The LFHC intervention did not affect the time to natural menopause overall (P = 0.72 for log-rank test comparing study groups; n = 699 events). An observed interaction between study group and baseline body mass index (BMI; P = 0.01) indicated that the intervention group experienced earlier menopause than did the control group when BMI was low and that a higher BMI was associated with later menopause in the intervention group only. Greater parity, weight, and education were associated with later menopause, and greater age at first birth and baseline smoking were associated with earlier menopause. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the LFHC dietary intervention did not influence the timing of menopause. Factors associated with age at menopause in this population were consistent with those reported in other populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation contributes to atherogenesis. Dietary fats may be proinflammatory. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether energy intake modulates the effects of low-fat, high-carbohydrate intakes on inflammatory markers. DESIGN: Twenty-two healthy postmenopausal women with a mean (+/-SD) age of 61 +/- 11 y, who were not receiving hormone replacement therapy, were fed eucaloric diets to reduce their fat intake from 35% to 15% of energy. Next, the women consumed a 15%-fat ad libitum diet under free-living conditions. Serum highly sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, HDL serum amyloid A, and adiponectin concentrations were measured at the end of the eucaloric and ad libitum low-fat, high-carbohydrate intakes. RESULTS: The eucaloric diet decreased adiponectin from 16.3 +/- 2.1 to 14.2 +/- 2.0 mg/L (P < 0.05) and increased triacylglycerol from 131 +/- 11 to 164 +/- 14 mg/dL (P < 0.01). The ad libitum low-fat diet caused 6 kg weight loss and decreased highly sensitive C-reactive protein from 4.3 +/- 0.6 to 2.5 +/- 0.5 mg/L (P < 0.01), decreased HDL serum amyloid A from 10.3 +/- 1.8 to 5.7 +/- 1.3 mg/L (P < 0.001), increased adiponectin from 14.2 +/- 2.0 to 16.3 +/- 1.7 mg/L (P < 0.05), and decreased triacylglycerol from 164 +/- 14 to 137 +/- 15 mg/dL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: During the eucaloric phase, the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet exerted unfavorable effects on the inflammatory markers. In contrast, the ad libitum low-fat, high-carbohydrate intake caused weight loss and affected inflammatory markers favorably. Thus, the energy content of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet determines changes in inflammatory markers.",

Forty-seven men (mean age, 35.7 +/- 11.4 years; body mass index, 29.0 +/- 5.1 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to either a high-CHO diet (CHO, 58%; fat, 26%; n = 23) or a high-MUFA diet (CHO, 45%; fat, 40%; MUFA, 22.5%; n = 24), which they consumed for 6 to 7 weeks. Fasting and postprandial lipemia after an oral fat load and fasting plasma apo C-III were measured at the beginning and at the end of the dietary intervention. Ad libitum consumption of the high-CHO diet induced a significant reduction in body weight (-2.6%, P < .0001), but had no impact on plasma apo C-III concentrations and on fasting and postprandial plasma TG levels. In contrast, ad libitum consumption of the high-MUFA diet also resulted in a significant reduction in body weight (-2.3%, P < .01) as well as in significant reductions in plasma apo C-III (-11%, P = .05) and fasting plasma TG (-17%, P < .01). Diet-induced variations in plasma apo C-III concentrations were correlated with changes in fasting and postprandial TG levels both in the high-CHO (r > 0.70, P < .001) and the high-MUFA groups (r > 0.42, P < .05). These results indicate that variations in plasma apo C-III levels are strong correlates of the fasting and postprandial plasma TG responses to high-MUFA and high-CHO diets.",

Our aim was to determine whether a low-fat, high-carbohydrate (CARB) diet impaired endothelial vasodilation compared with high saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA), or polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) diets. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty healthy subjects were randomly crossed over to 4, 3-week isocaloric diets high in PUFA, MUFA, or SFA, containing at least 25 g of the relevant fat or a low-fat, CARB, high-glycemic load diet. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), fasting blood lipids, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, plasma intercellular, and vascular adhesion molecules plasma E- and P-selectin were measured after each intervention. SFA impaired FMD compared with all other diets (5.41+/-2.45% versus 10.80+/-3.69%; P=0.01). FMD did not change on CARB relative to MUFA or PUFA, despite 23% to 39% rises in triglyceride and 10% to 15% falls in HDL cholesterol. P-selectin was highest after SFA (121+/-52.7 ng/mL) versus MUFA (98+/-44.5 ng/mL; P=0.001) and PUFA (96+/-36.4 ng/mL; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High SFA caused deterioration in FMD compared with high PUFA, MUFA, or CARB diets. Inflammatory responses may also be increased on this diet.",

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Sixty-three men were randomly assigned to one of the two diets that they consumed for 6 to 7 weeks. Body composition and fasting plasma lipid levels were measured at the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention. RESULTS: The high-CHO and high-MUFA diets induced significant and comparable reductions in body weight and waist circumference. These changes were accompanied by significant and comparable (p < 0.01) reductions in total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, the high-MUFA diet had more beneficial effects on plasma triglyceride concentrations (p < 0.01) and on plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p = 0.02) compared with the high-CHO diet. Diet-induced changes in waist circumference were significantly associated with changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the high-CHO group (r = 0.39, p = 0.03) but not in the high-MUFA group (r = 0.16, p = 0.38). DISCUSSION: Improvements in plasma lipids induced by the ad libitum consumption of a high-CHO diet seem to be partly mediated by changes in body weight, whereas lipid changes induced by the high-MUFA diet seem to be independent of changes in body weight.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To quantify the various components of splanchnic free fatty acid and very-low-density lipoprotein-triacylglycerol (VLDL-TAG) metabolism in order to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the development of fatty liver in severely burned patients, and to determine if decreasing free fatty acid availability by use of propranolol could potentially reduce hepatic fatty acid accumulation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hepatic fat accumulation results from an imbalance between fatty acid uptake, oxidation, and release via VLDL-TAG. Fatty acid delivery is accelerated in burn patients because of stimulated lipolysis. Since propranolol decreases lipolysis, it should also decrease hepatic fatty acid uptake and thus TAG synthesis. METHODS: Stable isotope-labeled tracers and regional catheterization enabled quantification of various parameters of lipid metabolism across the splanchnic bed in severely burned patients. The acute effects of propranolol treatment were studied in all patients, and in a subgroup of patients the chronic (3 weeks) effects of propranolol were assessed. RESULTS: The rate of splanchnic uptake of palmitate was 1.68 +/- 1.3 micromol/kg/min, whereas the rates of oxidation and VLDL-TG secretion were only 0.12 +/- 0.11 and 0.003 +/- 0.02 micromol/kg/min, respectively. Propranolol significantly reduced palmitate delivery, and thus palmitate uptake, without significantly affecting oxidation or VLDL-TAG secretion. Thus, palmitate storage was reduced from 1.53 +/- 1.30 micromol/kg/min without propranolol to 0.76 +/- 0.58 micromol/kg/min after propranolol. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic fat storage in burn patients is due to low rates of both fatty acid oxidation and VLDL-TAG secretion. Propranolol can decrease hepatic fat storage by limiting fatty acid delivery.",

      "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin resistance usually precedes the diagnosis of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. However, in most patients, the clinical expression of the disease could be prevented by dietary and lifestyle changes. We investigated the effects of a diet enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (Mediterranean diet) and a low fat, high-carbohydrate diet on in vivo and in vitro glucose metabolism in 59 young subjects (30 men and 29 women). METHODS: We carried out an intervention dietary study with a saturated fat phase and two randomized-crossover dietary periods: a high-carbohydrate diet and a Mediterranean diet for 28 days each. We analysed the plasma lipoproteins fractions, free fatty acids, insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in isolated monocytes at the end of the three dietary periods. RESULTS: In comparison to the saturated fat diet, the CHO and Mediterranean diets induced a decrease of LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001) and HDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001). Steady-state plasma glucose decreased (p = 0.023) and basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxiglucose uptake in peripheral monocytes increased in both diets (CHO and Mediterranean), (p = 0.007) indicating an improvement in insulin sensitivity. Fasting free fatty acids plasma values were correlated positively with steady state plasma glucose (r = 0.45; p < 0.0001). In addition, there was an inverse correlation between the mean glucose of the steady state plasma glucose period and logarithmic values of basal (r = -0.34; p = 0.003) and insulin stimulated glucose uptake in monocytes (r = -0.32; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Isocaloric substitution of carbohydrates and monounsaturated fatty acids for saturated fatty acids improved insulin sensitivity in vivo and in vitro, with an increase in glucose disposal. Both diets are an adequate alternatives for improving glucose metabolism in healthy young men and women.",

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, crossover trial. SETTING: Academic pediatric burn unit in tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Fourteen severely burned (>40% total body surface area) children underwent systemic metabolic and cross-leg muscle protein kinetic studies. INTERVENTIONS: All were treated clinically in a similar manner, including early excision and grafting, antimicrobial therapy, and isocaloric, isonitrogenous enteral nutritional support. Subjects randomly received either a high-carbohydrate enteral diet (3% fat, 82% carbohydrate, 15% protein), or a high-fat enteral diet (44% fat, 42% carbohydrates, 14% protein) for 1 week and then crossed over to the other diet for a second week. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On day 5 of each diet, muscle protein kinetics were determined from femoral arterial and venous blood samples during a primed-constant d5-phenylalanine infusion. Indirect calorimetry was used to determine systemic resting energy expenditure and respiratory quotient. The seven boys and seven girls were 7.1 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- sem) years old and suffered burns over 65 +/- 4% of their bodies, with 52 +/- 6% being third-degree burns. Muscle protein degradation markedly decreased (p <.01) with administration of the high-carbohydrate diet. Protein synthesis was unaltered. Endogenous insulin concentrations increased during the high-carbohydrate feeding period. No differences in energy expenditure were seen between study diets. CONCLUSIONS: In severely burned pediatric patients, enteral nutrition supplied predominantly as carbohydrate rather than fat improves the net balance of skeletal muscle protein across the leg. This is attributable to decreased protein breakdown, suggesting a protein-sparing effect of high-carbohydrate feedings.",

DESIGN: Randomized crossover design; each diet period was 1 month and a 2-week wash out period occurred in between. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Thirty healthy, free-living, nonsmoking men and women were recruited from the Melbourne, Australia, metropolitan region of Australia. Men were aged 35 to 55 years and postmenopausal women were aged 50 to 60 years and were not taking hormone replacement therapy. Twenty-eight subjects completed the study. INTERVENTION: Two diets of equal energy value: a modified-fat diet and a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet; the modified-fat diet had 3 times more energy from monounsaturated fat. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Arterial elasticity and serum lipoprotein concentrations. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The general linear model was used to investigate overall effect and any carryover or order effects. Paired t test and the general linear model were used to compare the results from the 2 diet periods. RESULTS: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was significantly higher on the modified-fat diet than on the low-fat/low-carbohydrate diet. Arterial elasticity and concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were not significantly different on the 2 diets. APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to favor a diet high in monounsaturated fat over a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet because of an effect on arterial elasticity. Other changes in diet may be needed to cause a beneficial effect on arterial elasticity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated beneficial metabolic effects of dietary monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in Type-2 diabetes mellitus (Type-2 DM). The question arises if dietary MUFA also has desirable effects on risk markers in subjects with high risk of developing Type-2 DM. SETTING: University department of endocrinology. SUBJECTS: Sixteen healthy, first-degree relatives (six men, 10 women, age (mean+/-s.d.): 35+/-2 years) with normal oral glucose tolerance tests. INTERVENTIONS: Randomised study with two 4-week treatment periods with either a carbohydrate-rich (CHO) diet (55 E% carbohydrate, 30 E% fat, 15 E% protein) or a diet rich in olive oil [MUFA 40 E% fat (25 E% as MUFA), 45 E% carbohydrate, 15 E% protein]. The periods were divided by a 4-week wash-out period. RESULTS: Similar lowering effects on total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride and apoB levels were seen after the two diets. Slightly higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (1.4+/-0.4 vs 1.3+/-0.4 mmol/l, P<0. 0001) and apoA-1 (1.2+/-0.3 vs 1.1+/-0.3 mmol/l, P<0.05) were found in the MUFA-diet. Furthermore, the insulin sensitivity, as assessed by Bergman's minimal model, and the first response insulin areas were similar, as were the 24-h blood pressures and the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Isocaloric diets rich in MUFA or rich in carbohydrate, respectively, seem to have similar effects on cardiovascular risk factors in persons at high risk of developing Type-2 DM. A potential risk, however, on body weight of high-fat diets should be kept in mind.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The appearance of breast tissue on mammography varies according to its composition. Fat is radiolucent and appears dark on mammography, while stromal and epithelial tissue has greater optical density and appears light. Extensive areas of radiologically dense breast tissue seen on mammography are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the adoption of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for 2 years would reduce breast density. METHODS: Women with radiologic densities in more than 50% of the breast area on mammography were recruited and randomly allocated to an intervention group taught to reduce intake of dietary fat (mean, 21% of calories) and increase complex carbohydrate (mean, 61% of calories) or to a control group (mean, 32% of calories from fat and 50% of calories from carbohydrates). Mammographic images from 817 subjects were taken at baseline and compared with those taken 2 years after random allocation by use of a quantitative image analysis system, without knowledge of the dietary group of the subjects or of the sequence in which pairs of images had been taken. The effects of the intervention on the mammographic features of breast area, area of dense tissues in the breast, and the percent of the breast occupied by dense tissue were examined using t tests. Multiple regression was used to examine these effects while accounting for age at trial entry, weight change, and menopausal status. RESULTS: After 2 years, the total area of the breast was reduced by an average of 233.7 mm2 (2.4%) (95% confidence interval [CI] = 106.9-360.6) in the intervention group compared with an average increase of 26.3 mm2 (0.3%) (95% CI = -108.0-160.5) in the control group (P = .01). The area of density was reduced by 374.4 mm2 (6.1%) (95% CI = 235.1-513.8) in the intervention group compared with an average of 127.7 mm2 (2.1%) (95% CI = 8.6-246.7) in the control group (P = .01). Weight loss was associated with a reduction in breast area. The effect of the intervention on breast area was only marginally statistically significant after weight change, menopausal status, and age at trial entry were taken into account (P = .06). Greater weight loss and becoming postmenopausal were associated with statistically significant reductions in the area of density on the mammographic image at 2 years (P = .04 and P<.001, respectively). Age at entry into the trial was marginally significant in the same direction (P = .06). The effect of the intervention on area of density remained statistically significant after controlling for weight loss, age at entry, and menopausal status (P = .03). The change in the percentage of dense tissue in the mammographic image was not significantly different between the two groups (P = .71). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results show that after 2 years, a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet reduced the area of mammographic density, a radiographic feature of the breast that is a risk factor for breast cancer. Longer observation of a larger number of subjects will be required to determine whether these effects are associated with changes in risk of breast cancer.",

The present study examines the effects of 2 years of dietary intervention on serum sex hormone levels in premenopausal women. Subjects with extensive mammographic densities were enrolled in a dietary intervention trial. The intervention involved intensive individual counselling aimed at reducing total dietary fat to 15% of calories. Control subjects received general advice about diet but were not counselled to change their fat intake. Serum sex hormone levels were measured in 220 premenopausal subjects at entry and 2 years after randomization. Two years after randomization oestradiol levels were 20% (70 pmol l(-1)) lower (P = 0.04) and progesterone levels were 35% (1.0 nmol l(-1)) lower (P = 0.004) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were 7% (1 IU) higher (P = 0.38) in the intervention group than in the control group. The FSH-oestradiol ratio was 13% higher in the intervention group (P = 0.18). Samples analysed accounting for the timing of the blood sample in relation to the menstrual cycle showed that, in the intervention group, oestradiol and progesterone levels were lower and FSH levels higher in subjects with blood samples taken more than 30 days after the last menstrual period. Because of the strong evidence linking ovarian hormonal activity to breast cancer risk, these results suggest that a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet may reduce risk of breast cancer by reducing exposure to ovarian hormones that are a stimulus to cell division in the breast.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A crossover design with a 15-day intervention diet was used. Eighteen patients were separated into two groups on the basis of hypoglycemic treatment (diet, n = 9, or diet plus glibenclamide, n = 9) and were assigned to a 15-day treatment with a high-carbohydrate/low-fiber diet containing 60% energy from carbohydrate and 20% from fat or a low-carbohydrate/low-fiber diet with 40% energy from carbohydrate and 40% from fat and then crossed over to the other diet for 15 more days. RESULTS: The high-carbohydrate diet produced a significant increase in postprandial blood glucose in patients on glibenclamide (13.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 11.0 +/- 1.8 mmol/l, P < 0.002, while no difference was recorded in the group on diet alone (9.7 +/- vs. 8.9 +/- 0.6 mmol/l). Postprandial insulin levels were significantly higher after the high-carbohydrate diet in the group on diet along (248 +/- 32 vs. 192 +/- 28 pmol/l, P < 0.01), while no significant differences were observed in the other group (226 +/- 19 vs. 202 +/- 24 pmol/l) The high-carbohydrate diet also induced a significant increase in fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations in both groups (1.36 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P < 0.05 and 1.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P < 0.05). No differences were observed in fasting plasma cholesterol and HDL. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of the high-carbohydrate diet on blood glucose control in NIDDM patients differ according to severity of glucose intolerance.",

The purpose of the present paper is to examine the long-term effects of participation in these studies by assessing nutrient intake and other variables several years after active participation had stopped. Two hundred sixteen women were eligible for the follow-up study and were invited to attend and interview with a dietician. Data were collected by food frequency questionnaire from 157 subjects (73%), and blood was obtained from 115 subjects. Total energy intake was slightly lower in the intervention group. Total fat and percent energy from fat were significantly lower in the intervention group. The intake of all types of fat (saturated fat, linoleic acid, and oleic acid) and dietary cholesterol was lower in the in the intervention group; however, the polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio did not differ between the groups. Total cholesterol and apoprotein B levels were lower in the intervention group compared to the control group. Follicle-stimulating hormone was 29% higher in postmenopausal members of the intervention group than in controls, but there was no difference in levels of estradiol. A total of 19 women enrolled in pilot studies had developed breast cancer, 5.7 times the number expected, confirming that the selection of women with extensive mammographic densities does identify a high-risk group. These data suggest that even quite short periods of intensive dietary counselling may have prolonged effects on diet, and that once subjects have adopted new dietary habits, the habits may persist even in the absence of continued counselling.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A crossover design with diet interventions and wash-out periods of 3 wk was applied. The patients were randomly assigned to a 3-wk treatment with a high-carbohydrate diet containing 50% of energy as carbohydrate and 30% of energy as fat (10% of energy as monounsaturated fatty acids) or an isocaloric diet with 30% of energy as carbohydrate and 50% of energy as fat (30% of energy as monounsaturated fatty acids). On the last day of the two diets, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was measured and day profiles of glucose, hormones, and lipids were performed to a test menu rich in carbohydrates. RESULTS: The diet rich in monounsaturated fat reduced daytime systolic (131 +/- 3 vs. 137 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.04) and 24-h systolic blood pressure (126 +/- 8 vs. 130 +/- 10 mmHg, P < 0.03) as well as daytime diastolic (78 +/- 2 vs. 84 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.02) and diurnal diastolic blood pressure (75 +/- 6 vs. 78 +/- 5 mmHg, P < 0.03) as compared with the high-carbohydrate diet. Evidence of lowered blood glucose levels on the high-monounsaturated diet compared with the high-carbohydrate diet were found with lower fasting blood glucose (6.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 6.8 +/- 0.5 mM, P < 0.05), lower average blood glucose levels (7.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 8.2 +/- 0.6 mM, P < 0.04), and peak blood glucose responses (9.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 11.3 +/- 0.7 mM, P < 0.02). The two diets had the same impact on lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: A diet rich in monounsaturated fat has beneficial effects on blood pressure and glucose metabolism, whereas no adverse effects on lipid composition in NIDDM subjects is detected.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of high-fat and high-carbohydrate (high-CHO) diet loads on gas exchange and ventilation in the COPD patients and normal subjects. The percentage of changes in the averaged values of VCO2, O2 consumption (VO2), respiratory quotient (RQ), minute ventilation (VE), and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) measured by a mass spectrometer for 5 min every 30 min after the diet were compared between diets and between study subjects. Compared with the high-fat diet, the high-CHO diet can lead to significantly higher levels of VCO2, VO2, RQ, and VE in the COPD patients 30 to 60 min after the diet, and the differences can last for about 1.5 h. The comparison between COPD patients and normal control subjects also showed that the high-CHO diet load can result in significantly higher levels of VCO2, VO2, and VE, and significantly lower level of ETCO2 in the COPD patients, whereas the high-fat diet cannot. In addition, enhanced thermic effect of food within 150 min (TEF150) occurred in the COPD patients as compared with that of normal controls, and the increase in TEF150 occurred only with the high-CHO diet. This study suggested that a high-fat diet is more beneficial to the COPD patient than a high-CHO diet, and that the gas exchange and energy utilization of the COPD patients following a high-CHO diet might be different from that of normal control subjects.",

The editing activity in extracts from 48h-fasted rats was suppressed relative to that of normal chow-fed rats. Refeeding with a high-sucrose fat-free chow for 48h stimulated liver in vitro editing activity to approximately three times that of control liver extracts. The physical properties of editosomes assembled in extracts from fasted/refed rats differed from those assembled in control or fasted rat liver extracts. Polypeptide analysis revealed quantitative alterations of several proteins in each treatment group suggesting a complex regulatory process.

We studied eight obese women before and after weight normalization (postobese state) and compared them with eight matched controls. Twenty-four hour EE, substrate oxidations, and 24-h heart rate were measured in respiratory chambers on a fixed physical program, while the postobese and controls were in macronutrient balance on a high-carbohydrate diet. Mean 24-h EE decreased from the obese to the postobese state (P less than 0.01), but it remained higher in the postobese women than in the controls (8,292 +/- 153 vs. 7,646 +/- 190 kJ/day, P = 0.01). The higher EE in the postobese group was entirely covered by a 22% higher carbohydrate oxidation (P = 0.006). The mean 24-h heart rate, as measured by telemetry, was also higher in the postobese group than in the control group (74 vs. 66 beats/min, P less than 0.03). Plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were greater by 50% in the postobese as compared with the controls (P = 0.004), and differences in plasma NE concentrations entirely accounted for the group difference in 24-h EE and heart rate between postobese and controls, as analyzed by stepwise regression analysis. We conclude that postobese women on a high-carbohydrate-low-fat diet have an enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity, which is responsible for the higher 24-h EE and heart rate. These findings may have implications for understanding the pathophysiology and for the treatment of obesity.",

During the 7 days before exercise, a high-carbohydrate diet was consumed (70% carbohydrate, 18% protein, 12% fat; 35 kcal/kg body weight). One hundred grams of either Polycose (placebo) or dihydroxyacetone and pyruvate (treatment, 3:1) were substituted for a portion of carbohydrate. Dietary conditions were randomized, and subjects consumed each diet separated by 7-14 days. After each diet, cycle ergometer exercise (70% of peak oxygen consumption) was performed to exhaustion. Biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle was obtained before and after exercise. Blood samples were drawn through radial artery and femoral vein catheters at rest, after 30 min of exercise, and at exercise termination. Leg endurance was 66 +/- 4 and 79 +/- 2 min after placebo and DHAP, respectively (P less than 0.01). Muscle glycogen at rest and exhaustion did not differ between diets. Whole leg arteriovenous glucose difference was greater (P less than 0.05) for DHAP than for placebo at rest (0.36 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.07 mM) and after 30 min of exercise (1.06 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.10 mM) but did not differ at exhaustion. Plasma free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were similar during rest and exercise for both diets. Estimated total glucose oxidation during exercise was 165 +/- 17 and 203 +/- 15 g after placebo and DHAP, respectively (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that feeding of DHAP for 7 days in conjunction with a high carbohydrate diet enhances leg exercise endurance capacity by increasing glucose extraction by muscle.",

Acetyl CoA carboxylase was purified 1,552 folds with a specific activity of 3.88 units/mg protein from livers of rats refed a high carbohydrate diet for 3 days following a 3-day fasting and the antibody was generated against the purified acetyl CoA carboxylase in a rabbit. Treatment of insulin (1.5 units/100g BW) and a high carbohydrate diet increased the amount of acetyl CoA carboxylase in liver cytosol by 3 times and 10 times, respectively, when compared to the enzyme content found in the control. The synthetic ratio of acetyl CoA carboxylase to total cytosolic proteins was 4 times higher in the insulin-treated group and 10 times higher in the high carbohydrated diet-treated group than the control group. The polysomal RNA contents in liver cytosols were 279% of the control in the insulin-treated group and 365% of the control in the high carbohydrate diet group. Also, the nascent chain of acetyl CoA carboxylase in polysome were 158% of the control in the insulin-treated group and 311% of the control in the high carbohydrate treated group. From these results, it is assumed that the increase of acetyl CoA carboxylase content in the rat liver cells by insulin treatment, or high carbohydrate diet refeeding has resulted from the increased polysomal acetyl CoA carboxylase mRNA, which is directly related to the biosynthesis of this enzyme.",

We have studied the effects of dietary fat on the breast by examining the influence of dietary fat reduction on mammographic dysplasia (nodular or sheetlike areas of radiological density). Subjects with mammographic dysplasia were randomly allocated to a control group, in which they received advice about maintaining a balanced diet (36% of calories as fat), or an intervention group, in which they were taught to reduce dietary fat to a target of 15% of calories. A total of 295 patients consented to randomization, and after 1 year, 20% of the intervention group and 5% of the control group had dropped out (failed to keep appointments and provide nutrient data). The remaining patients closely adhered to the dietary goals of the study as assessed by food records, chemical analysis of duplicate meals, and serum cholesterol measurements. Comparison of mammograms before and after 1 year of dietary fat reduction shows no significant influence on the extent or density of mammographic dysplasia. Surgical biopsies performed in subjects after entry in the study showed five cancers in the control group and two cancers in the intervention group; this total of seven cancers is four times the number expected. These data show that clinical trials of the effects of dietary fat reduction on breast cancer risk are feasible and that long-term compliance with a low-fat diet can be achieved, and they confirm that the patients selected because they had mammographic dysplasia had increased risk of breast cancer.",

The patients were randomly assigned to receive first one diet and then the other, each for 28 days, in a metabolic ward. In the high-carbohydrate diet, 25 percent of the energy was in the form of fat and 60 percent in the form of carbohydrates (47 percent of the total energy was in the form of complex carbohydrates); the high-monounsaturated-fat diet was 50 percent fat (33 percent of the total energy in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids) and 35 percent carbohydrates. The two diets had the same amounts of simple carbohydrates and fiber. As compared with the high-carbohydrate diet, the high-monounsaturated-fat diet resulted in lower mean plasma glucose levels and reduced insulin requirements, lower levels of plasma triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (lower by 25 and 35 percent, respectively; P less than 0.01), and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (higher by 13 percent; P less than 0.005). Levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol did not differ significantly in patients on the two diets. These preliminary results suggest that partial replacement of complex carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids in the diets of patients with NIDDM does not increase the level of LDL cholesterol and may improve glycemic control and the levels of plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol.",

Should future research indicate that a very high-CHO, low-fat diet is of additional benefit to the patient, then the dietary recommendations to the patient should be altered accordingly. It should be understood that diabetes is a chronic disease that requires intensive effort by the patient if reasonable management is to be attained. We should not complicate this management unnecessarily by dietary intervention unless clear benefits can be observed. For the type II, noninsulin-requiring diabetic person, dietary recommendations are even less certain. Obese patients should be encouraged to lose weight and to maintain a more ideal body weight, but one should not be disappointed if the patient is unable to accomplish this. Medical indications for weight loss rarely have been sufficient motivation for patients to remain on a semistarvation diet. Should safe, effective anorexigenic drugs become available, they clearly would be the treatment of choice for these patients. The best weight-maintenance diet for type II diabetic persons remains to be determined. A high-CHO, low-fat diet would appear to be best, provided it results in a more normal average level of blood glucose. An increase in dietary soluble fiber also may be useful in reducing the serum cholesterol concentration. In such a diet, those CHO foods that raise the postprandial glucose concentration the least should be emphasized.",

Six normal subjects studied in a clinical research center each received a single oral dose of propranolol, 80 mg, and theophylline, 5 mg/kg, after having been on each of two well-defined diets for a period of 10 days. When the diet was altered from high carbohydrate/low protein to low carbohydrate/high protein, the oral clearance of propranolol increased by 74% +/- 20% (mean +/- SE; range 9% to 156%; P less than 0.01) with no change in plasma half-life or plasma binding. This dietary change resulted in an increase in theophylline clearance of 32% +/- 6% (range 18% to 50%; P less than 0.02) and a corresponding decrease in plasma half-life of 26% +/- 6% (range 6% to 42%; P less than 0.05) with no alteration in the apparent volume of distribution. These observations reemphasize the importance of diet in drug disposition and suggest that the clearance of high-clearance drugs like propranolol is more susceptible than the clearance of low-clearance drugs to dietary manipulations, effects that may have to be considered in drug therapy.",

Also, the effects on myosin isoenzyme expression of adrenalectomy and hydrocortisone replacement have been studied in euthyroid animals. Myocardial CO2 production and hepatic alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase activity were measured to monitor the effects of these interventions on tissue respiration. The results indicate that there was no significant separation between the actions of thyroid analogs on metabolic parameters and myosin isoenzyme patterns. However, high carbohydrate feeding in hypophysectomized rats increased the isoenzyme V1 from 12% to about 36% of total myosin; partial replacement with 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine and fructose feeding had synergistic actions. In thyroidectomized rats, feeding a high carbohydrate diet increased the V1 form from undetectable levels to about 28% of total myosin; partial 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine replacement had an additive effect. Beta adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol and blockade with propranolol did not affect myosin isoenzyme expression. Adrenalectomy in euthyroid rats caused a 33% decrease in the V1 form and a corresponding increase in the V3 isoenzyme, which could be reversed by treatment with hydrocortisone. Thus, thyroid analogs do not selectively stimulate myosin isoenzyme expression as compared with their effects on energy production. Furthermore, the results suggest that the mechanism for regulation of cardiac myosin isoenzymes may involve a primary signal related to dietary carbohydrate, which is modulated by thyroid hormone, and possibly glucocorticoids.",
