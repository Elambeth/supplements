      "abstract": "This study explores the development of biodegradable starch-based films treated with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma and incorporated with acerola residue and grape pomace extracts. The primary aim was to enhance the films' physicochemical properties and introduce pH-sensing capabilities. Plasma treatment at 200 Hz for 20 min modified the films' amylose content (by 13.2%), solubility (by 13.3%), contact angle (by 12.7%), moisture content (by 14.2%), and surface morphology. The addition of the extracts changed the short-range ordered structure parameters of the films (by 111.4%), solubility (by 11.1%), moisture content (by 18.4%), and water vapor permeability (by 6.1%). The films with acerola residue and grape pomace extracts exhibited good colorimetric responses for pH indication. The films with acerola residue extract tended to intensify the yellowish color, while those with grape pomace extract showed more significant color changes varying from purple to green. Integrating natural pigments like anthocyanins from grape pomace and carotenoids from acerola improved the films' functional properties and provided a visual indication of food freshness through pH changes."

      "abstract": "Food safety and quality awareness have reached significant relevance as consumers are more interested in authentic foods and drinks with specific organoleptic values. Among foodstuffs, grape products can be contaminated by Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin that can occur in red grape after infection with Aspergillus carbonarius. The high affinity of grape pomace with OTA makes its use advantageous as an adsorbing/decontaminating material whether the pomace is fresh, has undergone pressing, or has undergone a stabilizing process. The effects of different grape repassage treatments on wine metabolic profiles were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with metabolomics. The relative quantification of discriminating metabolites for activated-carbon-treated samples revealed higher levels of ethyl acetate and succinate than for the grape-pomace-repassed wine samples. On the contrary, the latter exhibited a relatively high content of glycerol, lactate, tartaric, isobutanol, isopentanol, and polyphenols. Although a specific decrease in aromatic compounds such as gallic acid, tyrosine, and tyrosol was also observed compared with the controls, for the pomace-based processes, the activated carbon treatment led to a marked general impoverishment of the metabolomic profiles, with a reduction in organic acids and glycerol. The repassage of wine over the grape pomace did not significantly affect the quality attributes of the wine, offering an alternative natural adsorbing/decontaminating material for the removal of OTA."

      "abstract": "Grape pomace (GP) is a by-product rich in phytochemicals, including extractable polyphenols (EPPs) and non-extractable polyphenols (NEPPs), which have distinct metabolic fates that may affect their biological activities. The benefits of GP have been reported in relation to obesity and its comorbidities, particularly when administered preventively focusing on EPPs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EPPs and NEPPs from GP as a treatment for obesity and its associated metabolic alterations. A previous comprehensive characterization of the selected GP revealed the most relevant individual compounds in the EPPs fraction (malvidin hexoside, (-)-epicatechin, quercetin, and procyanidin dimer B2 isomer II), as well as in the NEPPs fraction (hydroxybenzoic acid isomers I-II). The experiment was performed in obese rats with insulin resistance, treated for 8 weeks with EPPs or NEPPs grape pomace fractions (100 mg/kg). After the intervention, the HFFD + EPP group showed a significantly lower weight gain (9.6%) and body mass index (9.7%) compared to the HFFD group. While liver triglyceride levels were only significantly reduced in the HFFD + NEPP group (47%) compared to the HFFD group. Neither treatment resulted in a reduction of insulin resistance. Therefore, the supplementation with grape pomace phenolic fractions to an animal model of obesity exerted differential beneficial effects on body weight and liver lipid accumulation, overall contributing to an amelioration of some the metabolic alterations present in obesity, although not to aspects such as glycemic homeostasis.",

This study aimed to investigate the impact of dietary supplementations with 'Arinto' grape pomace flour (GPF) (WGPF) and 'Touriga Nacional' GPF (RGPF) in an animal model of T2DM. Methods: T2DM was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) for 28 days and a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg) on the 21st day. Forty adult male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Control (CT), T2DM, T2DM + Metformin (250 mg/kg), T2DM + 10% 'Arinto' GPF (WGPF), and T2DM + 10% 'Touriga Nacional' GPF (RGPF). On the 21st day of the experimental protocol, animals were submitted to an oral glucose tolerance test. An oral glucose tolerance test, oxidative stress parameters, biochemical analysis, and pancreas histological analyses were performed. Results: T2DM impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum triglycerides and cholesterol, increased oxidative damage in the liver, and induced pancreatic histological abnormalities. However, supplementation with WGPF and RGPF demonstrated positive effects, mitigating glycemic and lipid disruptions, ameliorating oxidative stress, and protecting pancreatic Islets β-cells. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the protective effects of WGPF and RGPF in the adverse impacts of T2DM. Additionally, our study emphasizes the innovative use of grape pomace, a winemaking by-product, promoting sustainability by transforming waste into functional foods with significant health benefits."

      "abstract": "The inclusion of an ingredient made from red grape pomace (RGP) var. Tempranillo was evaluated for the preservation of a traditional dry-cured sausages (salchichón). The pomace was valorized through thermal blanching (103 °C for 1 min) and hydrostatic high-pressure treatment (600 MPa/5 min) before the addition to salchichón. Four formulations of salchichón were evaluated, including a negative control (NC-without red grape pomace or synthetic additives), positive control (PC-with ascorbic acid and nitrites), low level (LL-0.5%), and high level (HL-1%) of RGP. Physicochemical, microbiological, and sensorial effects were analyzed. RGP reduced the final pH of salchichón and favored the growth of lactic acid bacteria at similar levels as PC. The addition of ascorbic acid and nitrites resulted in a final product with a redder and less yellow color than the other formulations. This cured color was not reached with the addition of RGP. However, its inclusion slightly reduced lipid and protein oxidation in salchichón. PC showed high levels of sulfur and terpene levels in a volatile profile, although at a sensory level, only differences in spicy taste were not noticed by panelists. The incorporation of the ingredient could enable the substitution of nitrites with valorized red grape pomace in sausages, although the desirable color achieved with nitrifying salts was not fully attained."

      "abstract": "From the perspective of circular economy, it is extremely useful to recycle waste products for human health applications. Among the health-beneficial properties of bioactive phyto-compounds, grape pomace represents a precious source of bioactive molecules with potential antitumor properties. Here, we describe the effects of a Sicilian grape pomace hydroalcoholic extract (HE) in colon and breast cancer cells. The characterization of HE composition revealed the predominance of anthoxanthins and phenolic acids. HE treatment was more effective in reducing the viability of colon cancer cells, while breast cancer cells appeared more resistant. Indeed, while colon cancer cells underwent apoptosis, as shown by DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and PARP1 degradation, breast cancer cells seemed to not undergo apoptosis. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated. Interestingly, ROS increased in both cell lines but, while in colon cancer, cells' ROS rapidly increased and progressively diminished over time, in breast cancer, cells' ROS increase was persistent up to 24 h. This effect was correlated with the induction of pro-survival autophagy, demonstrated by autophagosomes formation, autophagic markers increase, and protection by the antioxidant NAC. The autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 significantly increased the HE effects in breast cancer cells but not in colon cancer cells. Overall, our data provide evidence that HE efficacy in tumor cells depends on a balance between ROS-mediated autophagy and apoptosis. Therefore, inhibiting pro-survival autophagy may be a tool to target those cells that appear more resistant to the effect of HE.",

      "abstract": "The black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) is attracting increasing interest for its ability to convert low-value substrates into highly nutritious feed. This study aimed at evaluating grape pomace from two varieties (Becuet - B; Moscato - M) as rearing substrates for black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), focusing on the related effects on larval growth performance, proximate composition, and fatty acid profile. A total of six replicates per treatment, and 1 000 BSFL per replica, were used. Larval development was assessed by larvae weight, which was recorded eight times during the trial: the day after the beginning of the trial, and then on days 5, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, and 27 (day in which the 30% of BSFL reached the prepupal stage). Production and waste reduction efficiency parameters, namely the growth rate, substrate reduction and substrate reduction index, were calculated. The two grape pomace varieties were analysed for their proximate composition and fatty acid profile; the same analyses were conducted on BSFL (30 larvae per replica) that were collected at the end of the trial (day 27). The growth rate of BSFL showed a higher value when the larvae were reared on B substrate (4.4 and 3.2 mg/day for B and M, respectively; P < 0.01). The rearing substrate did not significantly affect the proximate composition of BSFL. The percentage of total lipids (TL) in M-fed BSFL was significantly higher than in B ones. Total saturated (P < 0.001) and monounsaturated fatty acids (P < 0.05) were significantly higher in M-fed BSFL, while an opposite trend was observed for total branched-chain (P < 0.001) and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (P < 0.001). Interestingly, some conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers [i.e., C18:2 c9t11(+t7c9+t8c10) and t9t11] were detected in low amounts in both rearing substrates (total CLA equal to 0.085 and 0.16 g/100 g TL in B and M substrate, respectively). Some CLA isomers (i.e., C18:2 c9t11, t7c9, and t10c12) were also found in BSFL, reaching a total CLA concentration equal to 2.95 and 0.052 g/100 g of TL in B-fed and M-fed BSFL, respectively. This study demonstrates that winery by-products from different grape varieties can significantly affect the development and lipid composition of BSFL. The CLA biosynthesis potential of BSFL opens newsworthy perspectives for a new valorisation of winery by-products to produce full-fat black soldier fly meal and black soldier fly oil enriched in specific fatty acids of potential health-promoting interest.",

      "abstract": "Grape pomace (GP) is considered a natural source of bioactive compounds. To improve the extractability of bioactive compounds, in this work, GP was biologically treated for 15 days with the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor in laboratory jars and a tray bioreactor under solid-state fermentation (SSF) conditions. During SSF, the activity of lignolytic (laccase and manganese peroxidase) and hydrolytic (xylanase, cellulase, β-glucosidase, and invertase) enzymes was measured, with the activities of laccase (2.66 U/gdb in jars and 0.96 U/gdb in the bioreactor) and xylanase (346.04 U/gdb in jars and 200.65 U/gdb in the bioreactor) being the highest. The effect of the complex enzyme system was reflected in the changes in the chemical composition of GP with increasing ash, crude protein, and free fat content: 28%, 10%, and 17% in the laboratory jars, and 29%, 11%, and 7% in the bioreactor, respectively. In addition, the biological treatment improved the extractability of 13 individual phenolic compounds. Therefore, the applied SSF technique represents an effective strategy to improve the profile of phenolic compounds and the nutritional composition of GP, promoting their valorization and opening the door for potential applications in the food industry and other sectors."

      "abstract": "Delivering natural antioxidants via in ovo feeding holds promise for enhancing the antioxidant status and performance of chickens. Therefore, The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of in ovo feeding during early embryonic development using grape pomace extract as a natural antioxidant on hatchability, productive performance, immune response, and antioxidant status in broilers. A total of 900 fertile broiler eggs from the Arbor Acres strain were utilized. Each egg was individually weighed, with egg weights ranging from 61.88 ± 3 g. On the 17.5th d of incubation (DOI), the fertile eggs were divided into 6 groups. The first treatment group was untreated and designated as the control (C). The second group was the sham group (Sh), receiving a simulated injection. The third group, designated as the vehicle group (V), was injected with 100 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The fourth group received an injection of 100 µL of grape pomace dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 2 mg (T2). Similarly, the fifth and sixth groups were injected with 100 µL of grape pomace dissolved in DMSO at concentrations of 4 mg and 6 mg, (T4), (T6) respectively. Subsequently, all groups were raised under uniform conditions in terms of management, environment, and nutrition till 5 wk of age. The grape pomace extract (GPE), obtained is rich in total phenolic content (16.07 mg/g), total flavonoid content (7.42 mg/g), and total anthocyanin (8.37 mg/g). Grape pomace extract has exhibited significant antioxidant properties as evidenced by its effectiveness in DPPH scavenging and reducing power assays. Significant improvements in body weight at hatch were observed with in ovo feeding of grape pomace extract, particularly at the 4 mg level, surpassing the effectiveness of the 2 mg and 6 mg grape pomace levels, and this enhancement in body weight continued until the age of 5 wk. GPE injection also led to a significant reduction in cholesterol levels, with the lowest levels recorded for the T4 group. Plasma total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) levels were significantly elevated in groups treated with T4, T6, and T2 compared to the control group. Conversely, the control group showed a significant increase (P < 0.01) in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The immune response of hatched chicks from grape pomace extract-injected groups, especially the T4 group, exhibited improvement through increased IgM and IgG. These findings demonstrate that in ovo feeding of GPE, particularly at a dosage of 4 mg, enhances growth performance, immune response, and antioxidant status in hatched chicks. Thus, administering natural antioxidants, such as grape pomace extract, to developing broiler embryos via in ovo feeding could serve as a valuable strategy for enhancing the subsequent post-hatch productive performance, as well as bolstering the antioxidant and immunological status of broiler chicks.",

This study investigates the anti-inflammatory properties of a polyphenolic fraction derived from GP, obtained by ultrasound-microwave hybrid extraction and purified using ion-exchange chromatography. In the inflammation model, mice were divided into six groups: intact, carrageenan, indomethacin, and three GP polyphenols treatment groups. Paw edema was induced by subplantar injection of carrageenan, and the GP polyphenols were administered intraperitoneally at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg. The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by measuring paw volume, and expression of inflammatory markers: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6), along with lipid peroxidation levels. The GP polyphenols significantly reduced paw edema and expression levels of COX-2, MPO, and cytokines in a dose-dependent manner effect, with the highest dose showing the greatest reduction. Additionally, lipid peroxidation levels were also decreased by GP polyphenols treatment at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. These findings suggest that ultrasound-microwave extraction combined with amberlite purification proved to be effective in obtaining a polyphenolic-rich fraction from GP. Thus, GP polyphenols may serve as a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent for treating inflammation and oxidative stress-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Grape pomace is the main by-product of vine-winery chains. It requires adequate treatment and disposal but is also an economically underused source of bioactive plant secondary metabolites. This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial effects of polyphenolic extracts from Aglianico (Vitis vinifera L.) grape pomace. In particular, hydroethanolic extracts obtained via an ultrasonic-assisted extraction technique were selected for antimicrobial tests. The extracts were screened for their antibacterial effects against foodborne pathogens that were both Gram-positive, in the case of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative, in the case of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, showing variable bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects. In addition, our results demonstrated that the tested grape pomace extracts can reduce the inhibitory concentration of standard antibiotics. Interestingly, selected extracts inhibited biofilm development by S. aureus and B. cereus. Overall, these new insights into the antibacterial properties of grape pomace extracts may represent a relevant step in the design of novel therapeutic tools to tackle foodborne diseases, and in the management of resistant biofilm-related infections."

A total of 750, two-week-old male Ross 308 broilers (317.7 ± 10.12 g live weight) were randomly assigned to 25 cages, with each cage as an experimental unit. The broilers were stocked at a density of 30 birds per cage with a floor space of 1.32 m2. Dietary treatments were a standard grower or finisher diet (CON); CON containing 30 g RGP /kg diet plus either 1 (GPA1), 2 (GPA2), 3 (GPA3), or 4% (GPA4) AVG in drinking water. Treatment GPA1 promoted higher (P < 0.05) overall weight gain and overall feed conversion ratio (FCR) than CON. Positive quadratic effects (P < 0.05) were noted for mean corpuscular hemoglobin, basophils, 24-hour breast meat yellowness, chroma, and hue angle. The GPA2 group had the lowest (P < 0.05) gait score while the CON group had the highest score. Concurrent supplementation with a 30 g RGP /kg diet plus 1% AVG in drinking water enhanced weight gain, FCR, and finisher weight of densely stocked broilers. However, AVG doses beyond 1% did not enhance performance and physiological traits in densely stocked broilers.",

      "abstract": "The potentiality of cv. Malbec grape pomace (GP) as a functional ingredient in the formulation of bakery foods (muffins, biscuits and cereal bars) was studied. The effect of GP addition on the phenolic compounds (PCs) composition, nutritional and sensory properties were evaluated. The addition of GP increased the content of dietary fiber, proteins, ash, total phenolic content (TPC), antiradical capacity (AC), anthocyanins and non-anthocyanin PCs while decreasing the carbohydrates content. The main PCs given by the GP to supplemented foods were quercetin-3-O-glucoside, rutin, caffeic acid, syringic acid and (+)-catechin. For anthocyanins, the acylated derivatives were more stable to heat treatment (baking) in food processing which was evidenced by a higher proportion of these PCs compounds when compared to the same derivatives quantified in GP. In general, when the TPC or individual concentrations of PCs were analyzed in a nutritional or functional context, one portion of the supplemented foods showed levels high enough to satisfy the recommended dose per day of these bioactive compounds. Additionally, the foods were well received by consumers during the sensory evaluation and supplemented biscuits received the highest acceptability. This study demonstrated that GP could be a viable functional ingredient in bakery foods to incorporate components like PCs and dietary fiber into traditional consumers' diets."

The treatment developed was performed under mild acidic conditions, imparted by the addition of citric acid, and it was first evaluated on the basis of severity, establishing linear models that described the correlation between treatment performance and combined severity factors. To solicit treatment optimization, response surface methodology was implemented, considering solvent acidity and residence time as the treatment variables. The optimized treatment afforded maximum total polyphenol (166 ± 6 mg GAE g-1 DM), total pigment (4.4 ± 0.2 mg MvE g-1 DM) and total flavanol (31.5 mg CtE g-1 DM) yields and extracts with particularly enhanced antioxidant activity. This might be attributed to specific constituents with high antioxidant potency, such as catechin, determined in the extract using high-performance liquid chromatography. Thus, the treatment developed is proposed as a highly efficient process to generate RGP extracts enriched in polyphenolic compounds, with enhanced antioxidant activity. Such extracts might then be valorized as food additives, to provide antioxidant protection and/or pigmentation.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is a widespread health risk, affecting over a billion people and causing 9 million deaths per year. The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) is a primary target for hypertension treatment, and it is primarily treated through drugs that inhibit the Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme (ACE). In addition to pharmacological treatment, various plants are recommended in traditional medicine for blood pressure regulation. This study aimed to produce high-phenolic-content extracts with and without enzymatic assistance from red grape pomace and evaluate their antioxidant capacity and ACE inhibitory potential. The total phenolic content (TPC) was measured, and phenolic identification was performed using HPLC analysis. In addition, the antioxidant capacity and anti-hypertensive potential were determined via in vitro assays. There was no statistical difference in the TPC antioxidant capacity between the extraction methods. Otherwise, when considering the extraction yield, the enzymatic process recovered around 70% more phenolic compounds from the pomace, and the phenolic profile was changed. Enzymatic assistance also significantly increased the ACE inhibitory potential in the grape pomace extract. This study demonstrates the viability of upcycling grape pomace to obtain bioactive compounds and to reduce their environmental impact, and highlights the influence of the enzymatic extraction on the hypotensive potential of the extract."

      "abstract": "The microbial production of cellulose using different bacterial species has been extensively examined for various industrial applications. However, the cost-effectiveness of all these biotechnological processes is strongly related to the culture medium for bacterial cellulose (BC) production. Herein, we examined a simple and modified procedure for preparing grape pomace (GP) hydrolysate, without enzymatic treatment, as a sole growth medium for BC production by acetic acid bacteria (AAB). The central composite design (CCD) was used to optimise the GP hydrolysate preparation toward the highest reducing sugar contents (10.4 g/L) and minimal phenolic contents (4.8 g/L). The experimental screening of 4 differently prepared hydrolysates and 20 AAB strains identified the recently described species Komagataeibacter melomenusus AV436T as the most efficient BC producer (up to 1.24 g/L dry BC membrane), followed by Komagataeibacter xylinus LMG 1518 (up to 0.98 g/L dry BC membrane). The membranes were synthesized in only 4 days of bacteria culturing, 1 st day with shaking, followed by 3 days of static incubation. The produced BC membranes in GP-hydrolysates showed, in comparison to the membranes made in a complex RAE medium 34 % reduction of crystallinity index with the presence of diverse cellulose allomorphs, presence of GP-related components within the BC network responsible for the increase of hydrophobicity, the reduction of thermal stability and 48.75 %, 13.6 % and 43 % lower tensile strength, tensile modulus, and elongation, respectively. Here presented study is the first report on utilising a GP-hydrolysate without enzymatic treatment as a sole culture medium for efficient BC production by AAB, with recently described species Komagataeibacter melomenusus AV436T as the most efficient producer in this type of food-waste material. The scale-up protocol of the scheme presented here will be needed for the cost-optimisation of BC production at the industrial levels.",

      "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is widespread in the population, causing oral or genital ulcers and, rarely, severe complications such as encephalitis, keratitis, and neonatal herpes. Current available anti-HSV drugs are acyclovir and its derivatives, although long-term therapy with these agents can lead to drug resistance. Thus, the discovery of novel antiherpetic compounds merits additional studies. In recent decades, much scientific effort has been invested in the discovery of new synthetic or natural compounds with promising antiviral properties. In our study, we tested the antiviral potential of a novel polyphenol-based nutraceutical formulation (named Taurisolo®) consisting of a water polyphenol extract of grape pomace. The evaluation of the antiviral activity was carried out by using HSV-1 and HSV-2 in plaque assay experiments to understand the mechanism of action of the extract. Results were confirmed by real-time PCR, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and fluorescence microscope. Taurisolo® was able to block the viral infection by acting on cells when added together with the virus and also when the virus was pretreated with the extract, demonstrating an inhibitory activity directed to the early phases of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection. Altogether, these data evidence for the first time the potential use of Taurisolo® as a topical formulation for both preventing and healing herpes lesions."

Recently, we found that it could be used as a new source of pig feed. We investigated the effect of grape pomace on inflammation, gut barrier function, meat quality, and growth performance in finishing pigs. Our results indicated that treatment samples showed a significant decrease in water loss, IL-1β, DAO, ROS, and MDA content (p < 0.05). IgA, IgG, IgM, CAT, T-AOC, SOD, and IFN-γ significantly increased compared with those in control samples (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the relative mRNA expression of the tight junction protein occludin showed a significant difference (p < 0.05). Analysis of metagenomic sequencing indicated that grape pomace significantly decreased the relative abundance of Treponema and Streptococcus (p < 0.05). In summary, our results demonstrated that grape pomace could improve meat quality, alleviate inflammation, and decrease oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Flavonoids, stilbenes, lignans, and phenolic acids, classes of polyphenols found in grape pomace (GP), were investigated as an important alternative source for active substances that could be used in the management of oxidative stress and inflammation. The benefic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of GP are presented in the literature, but they are derived from a large variety of experimental in vitro and in vivo settings. In these in vitro works, the decrease in reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels and the increase in glutathione levels show the antioxidant effects. The inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B and prostaglandin E2 inflammatory pathways and the decrease of some inflammatory markers such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) demonstrate the anti-inflammatory actions of GP polyphenols. The in vivo studies further confirmed the antioxidant (increase in catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels and a stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase -eNOS gene expression) and anti-inflammatory (inhibition of IL-1𝛼, IL-1β, IL-6, interferon-𝛾, TNF-α and C-reactive protein release) activities. Grape pomace as a whole extract, but also different individual polyphenols that are contained in GP can modulate the endogenous pathway responsible in reducing oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. The present review analyzed the effects of GP in oxidative stress and inflammation, suggesting that it could become a valuable therapeutic candidate capable to reduce the aforementioned pathological processes. Grape pomace extract could become an adjuvant treatment in the attempt to reduce the side effects of the classical anti-inflammatory medication like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).",

      "abstract": "Because of its high content of polyphenolic compounds, dietary inclusion of grape pomace (GP) in finishing cattle diet could possibly enhance product quality and the health value of beef lipids. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding a high amount of grape pomace in finishing cattle diets on carcass traits, product quality, and fatty acid (FA) composition of beef. Jersey × Holstein crosses (n = 24) were fed either a typical finishing diet (CON) or a finishing diet containing 58% grape pomace (DM basis; HGP). Following the feeding period, animals were harvested, and carcass traits measured. Longissimus lumborum (LL) and semimembranosus (SM) muscle were then collected from each carcass for sensory quality evaluation and FA profile analysis. Hot carcass weight, backfat thickness, and preliminary and final yield grades were greater (p ≤ 0.04) for CON than HGP steers. However, there was no diet effect on rib eye area (REA), kidney, pelvic, and heart (KPH) fat, and marbling. Feeding the HGP compared to CON diet reduced lipid oxidation of LL and SM steaks over time; the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, which did not differ on d 0 and 2 of 8-d simulated retail display, was lower on d 4, 6 and 8 for HGP than CON steers (treatment × day of simulated display interaction; p < 0.01). Brightness (L* values) and redness (b*) were greater for LL steaks from HGP than CON steers on most days of simulated display (treatment × day of simulated display interaction; p < 0.01). In addition, the LL and SM muscle content of several FA linked to positive health outcomes in humans including 18:2 n-6, 18:2 c9t11, total conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was also greater (p ≤ 0.02) for steers fed the HGP compared to the CON diet. In summary, current findings suggest that although it could possibly limit growth performance, feeding a high amount of grape pomace to finishing cattle could enhance both the sensory quality and the health value of beef lipids, which are key in increasing consumer acceptability of beef."

      "abstract": "Grape pomaces have recently received great attention for their richness in polyphenols, compounds known to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. These pomaces, however, have low brain bioavailability when administered orally due to their extensive degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. To overcome this problem, Nasco pomace extract was incorporated into a novel nanovesicle system called nutriosomes, composed of phospholipids (S75) and water-soluble maltodextrin (Nutriose® FM06). Nutriosomes were small, homogeneously dispersed, had negative zeta potential, and were biocompatible with intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2). Nasco pomace extract resulted rich in antioxidant polyphenols (gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, procyanidin B2, and quercetin). To investigate the neuroprotective effect of Nasco pomace in the subacute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), Nasco nutriosomes or Nasco suspension was administered intragastrically and their neuroprotective effects were evaluated. Degeneration of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons induced by subacute MPTP treatment, the pathological hallmark of PD, was assessed through immunohistochemical evaluation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and the dopamine transporter (DAT) in CPu. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Nasco nutriosomes significantly prevented the reduction in TH- and DAT-positive fibres in CPu, and the number of TH-positive cells in SNc following subacute MPTP treatment, while Nasco suspension counteracted MPTP toxicity exclusively in SNc. Overall, these results highlight the therapeutic effects of Nasco pomace extract when administered in a nutriosome formulation in the subacute MPTP mouse model of PD and validate the effectiveness of the nutriosome preparation over suspension as an innovative nano-drug delivery system for in vivo administration."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, interest in the use of herbs and phytogenic compounds has grown because of their potential role in the production and health of livestock animals. Among these compounds, several tannins have been tested in poultry, but those from chestnut wood and grape-industry byproducts have attracted remarkable interest. Thus, the present study aimed to gain further insights into the mechanisms involved in the response to the dietary supplementation with extracts of chestnut wood or grape pomace. To this purpose, 864 broiler chickens were fed a control diet (C) or the same diet supplemented 0.2% chestnut wood (CN) extract or 0.2% grape pomace (GP) extract from hatching until commercial slaughtering (at 45 days of age) to assess their effects on performance, meat quality, jejunum immune response and whole-transcriptome profiling in both sexes at different ages (15 and 35 d). RESULTS: Final live weight and daily weight gain significantly increased (P < 0.01) in chickens fed GP diets compared to CN and C diets. The villi height was lower in chickens fed the CN diet than in those fed the C diet (P < 0.001); moreover, a lower density of CD45+ cells was observed in chickens fed the CN diet (P < 0.05) compared to those fed the C and GP diets. Genes involved in either pro- or anti-inflammatory response pathways, and antimicrobial and antioxidant responses were affected by GP and CN diets. There was no effect of the dietary treatment on meat quality. Regarding sex, in addition to a lower growth performance, females showed a lower occurrence of wooden breast (16.7% vs. 55.6%; P < 0.001) and a higher occurrence of spaghetti meat (48.6% vs. 4.17%; P < 0.001) in pectoralis major muscles after slaughtering than those in males. Based on the results of whole-transcriptome profiling, a significant activation of some molecular pathways related to immunity was observed in males compared with those of females. CONCLUSIONS: The GP supplementation improved chicken performance and promoted immune responses in the intestinal mucosa; moreover, age and sex were associated with the most relevant transcriptional changes."

      "abstract": "Wineries produce considerable amounts of grape pomace, which is a readily available natural source of bioactive phenolic compounds. In this study, grape pomace was used as a substrate for the cultivation of eleven filamentous fungi (Trametes versicolor TV6, Trametes versicolor TV8, Trametes versicolor AG613, Trametes gibbosa, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, Pleurotus eryngii, Ganoderma lucidum, Ganoderma resinaceum, Humicola grisea, and Rhizopus oryzae) under solid-state conditions (SSF) for 15 days with the aim of improving the recovery of the individual phenolic compounds. Twenty-one phenolic compounds were quantified and the recovery of seventeen of them (gallic acid, ellagic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, o-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, epicatechin gallate, galocatechin gallate, quercetin, kaempferol, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, resveratrol, and ε-viniferin) were positively affected by SSF. Ellagic acid is the most recovered compound, whose content increased 8.8-fold after 15 days of biological treatment with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora compared to the untreated initial sample. Among the microorganisms tested, the fungi Pleurotus eryngii and Rhizopus oryzae proved to be the most effective in increasing the recovery of most phenolic compounds (1.1-4.5-fold). In addition, the nutrient composition (proteins, ash, fats) of grape pomace was positively affected by the biological treatments."

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide, mainly triggered by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques that reduce blood flow. Angiogenic cell therapy based on endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) constitutes a promising alternative to promote vascular revascularization; however, under the oxidative environment that prevails in ischemic areas, these cells become impaired. Thus, it is necessary to investigate strategies to enhance their regenerative properties. Antioxidant substances, such as polyphenols, have been shown to be useful for this purpose. In the current study we evaluated the potential of mango leaves, olive leaves and red grape pomace extracts, rich in polyphenols, to promote ECFC reparative effects. For this, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the aforementioned raw materials were obtained by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE). After evaluating the polyphenol content and the antioxidant activity, in vitro assays were carried out, and we found that ethanolic extracts at low concentrations improved angiogenic capacities of ECFCs and reduced proliferation, apoptosis, and the inflammatory response of these cells. Overall, mango leaves ethanolic extract provided the most promising results, but all three extracts ameliorated the functionality of ECFCs."

      "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to assess in laying hens the effect of including grape pomace (GP, at 30 or 60 g/kg) or grape extract (GE, at 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg) on egg production, feed conversion ratio, protein and polyphenol digestibility, egg weight, egg quality, yolk fatty acid profile and oxidative stability of yolk lipids. No differences were detected among diets for egg production (83.8%, on average) or egg mass (56.8 g/d, on average). However, the average egg weight was lower (p = 0.004) for dietary treatments GP 30, GP 60 and GE 0.5 (67.5 g, on average) than for control hens (68.5 g). Accordingly, in hens fed the GP diets the proportion of XL eggs was lower (p = 0.008) than in control hens, while the proportion of M eggs was higher (p < 0.001) in hens fed the diets GP 30, GP 60 and GE 0.5 than in the control group. The dietary inclusion of both GP and GE decreased daily feed intake (120.9 vs. 125.3 g/d, p < 0.001) and the feed conversion ratio (2.09 vs. 2.18, p = 0.01). Feeding GP at 60 g/kg or GE reduced excreta protein digestibility (54.7 vs. 62.8%, p < 0.001), whereas all GP and GE diets showed higher excreta polyphenol digestibility than the control treatment (57.2 vs. 41.0%, p < 0.001). While yolk colour score was increased with all grape diets (8.12 vs. 7.34, p < 0.001), the dietary inclusion of GP, either at 30 or 60 g/kg, and that of GE at 1.0 g/kg increased the Haugh units of the albumen (80.8 vs. 76.4 Haugh units, p = 0.001). Shell thickness remained unaffected by dietary treatments (365.2 μm, on average). When included in the diet at 60 g/kg, GP reduced the proportion of saturated fatty acids in the yolk (31.6 vs. 32.9%, p = 0.001) and that of monounsaturated fatty acids (39.5 vs. 41.4%, p < 0.001), while it increased the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (28.9 vs. 25.7%, p < 0.001). In fresh eggs, no significant differences were found for the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration (0.146 mg/kg, on average). In stored eggs, the MDA amount was lower in the eggs of the laying hens fed GP at 60 g/kg than in the eggs of the control hens (1.14 vs. 1.64 mg/kg, p = 0.025). In conclusion, the inclusion of grape pomace, either at 30 or 60 g/kg, and grape extract at 1.0 g/kg in the diet of laying hens improved some egg quality traits, but feeding grape pomace resulted in a lower average weight of eggs. Nevertheless, feeding laying hens with diets containing grape pomace resulted in a higher antioxidant potential in egg yolk than dietary inclusion of grape extract."

      "abstract": "Grape pomace and grapeseed are agro-industrial by-products, whose inadequate treatment generates socioeconomic and environmental concerns. Nevertheless, it is possible to valorize them by extracting their bioactive compounds, such as antioxidants (phenolic compounds), vitamin E and fatty acids. The bioactive compounds were extracted using solid-liquid extraction. The yields for phenolic compounds were 18.4 ± 0.4% for grape pomace, and 17.4 ± 0.4%, for grapeseed. For the oil, the yields were 13.3 ± 0.2% and 14.5 ± 0.3% for grape pomace and grapeseed. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the assay with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and showed that phenolic extract has higher antioxidant capacity than the oils. Grape pomace and grapeseed extracts exhibit, correspondingly, values of 90.8 ± 0.8 and 87.5 ± 0.5 of DPPH inhibition and IC50 of 48.9 ± 0.5 and 55.9 ± 0.7 μgextract·mLDPPH-1. The antimicrobial capacity was assessed by the disk diffusion test, and revealed that, phenolic extracts inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The obtained extracts were incorporated in 10 face cream formulations, with slight modifications in quantities of formulation stabilizers. Their stability was studied for 35 days, and this revealed the possibility of incorporating extracts and oils obtained from by-products as antioxidants in cosmetics, and replacing synthetic ones. As a future recommendation, microencapsulation of the extracts should be performed, in order to increase their stability.",

Alfalfa at 42% dry matter (DM) was treated in a 2 × 2 factorial design: with the application of Lp A1 at 0 (control) or 1 × 106 cfu/g of fresh forage, and GP at 0 or 5% of fresh forage. After 60 d of ensiling, a decrease in nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) was observed in GP treated silage. Lp A1 inoculated silage had a lower fiber content than silages without Lp A1. The lowest NPN was found in silage treated with LG, and an obvious increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus paracasei was detected in silages treated with Lp A1 and LG, respectively. In vitro ruminal experiments indicated that, although the application of GP deceased ruminal total gas, CH4 production, nitrogen degradation and the number of methanogenic archaea in alfalfa silage, it also reduced silage DM digestibility. In contrast, inoculation with Lp A1 not only increased DM digestibility and populations of ruminal Ruminococcus flavefaciens and fungi, but also improved ruminal total gas and CH4 production. As expected, LG treatment decreased alfalfa silage ruminal total gas and CH4 production relative to Lp A1 treatment alone, and increased silage DM digestibility compared with GP treated silage. In conclusion, the application of LG before ensiling alfalfa, balanced silage proteolysis, feed digestibility, and CH4 emission, and could be a promising strategy for using food industry by-products to produce a nutritional and environmentally-friendly legume silage that will mitigate N and greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants.",

Some recent results suggest that GP-derived extracts could be promising additives in food, specially recommended for low-salt diets. The hypothesis tested in this paper is that the regular consumption of GP-derived seasonings could help in the control of hypertension and glycaemia. Methods: A randomized intervention study (6 weeks) was performed in high-risk cardiovascular subjects (n = 17) and in healthy subjects (n = 12) that were randomly allocated into intervention (2 g day-1 of GP seasoning) or control (no seasoning consumed) groups. Blood samples, faeces, urine and blood pressure (BP) were taken at the baseline and at the end of the intervention. Faecal samples were analysed for microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and microbial-derived metabolites (short chain fatty acids and phenolic metabolites). Results: Among the clinical parameters studied, BP and fasting blood glucose significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after the seasoning intervention, but not for the control group. Notably, application of a novel approach based on ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) co-occurrence networks allowed us to identify some bacterial communities whose relative abundances were related with metadata. Conclusion: Our primary findings suggest that GP-seasoning may help in the modulation of cardiometabolic risk factors, mainly in the early stages. Furthermore, it evidences modulation of gut microbiota and functional bacterial communities by grape pomace, which might mediate the cardiometabolic effects of this by-product.",

However, it is important that the sought alternatives are cost-efficient and have no negative impact on meat quality, for ease of adoption and profit maximization. This study aimed at exploiting an agro-industrial waste, grape pomace (GP) as an alternative to in-feed antibiotics and assessing the effects on growth, intestinal morphology, ceca microbiota, ceca short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration, blood biochemical parameters, and breast muscle myopathies of broiler chickens. A total of 576 one-day-old Cobb-500 broiler chicks were randomly allotted to 3 dietary treatments - Negative control (NC, a corn-wheat soybean-based diet), NC + 0.05% bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD), and NC + 2.5% GP. Each treatment was assigned to 8 replicate pens with 25 birds per pen. Body weight (BW), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were determined weekly. On d 36, 2 chickens/pen were euthanized for measuring blood biochemical parameters, ceca SCFA, and ceca microbiota. White striping (WS) and wooden breast (WB) incidence were assessed in 4 chickens/pen on d 42. The GP diet increased (P < 0.05) average FI throughout the feeding phases compared to the other treatments, but overall FCR was similar. Birds in the GP treatment had higher (P < 0.05) villus height (VH) and increased VH:crypt depth ratio in the duodenum and jejunum compared to other treatments. The level of ceca SCFA and the incidence of WS and WB was the same for all treatments. Plasma Ca and P were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in birds fed GP and BMD, compared to the NC. Birds in the GP treatment had significantly reduced (P < 0.05) plasma aspartate transaminase than other treatments. Birds receiving GP had a higher (P < 0.05) relative abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes and reduced (P < 0.05) Firmicutes compared to other treatments. The relative abundance of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus genera were higher (P < 0.05) among birds fed GP compared to other treatments. Inclusion of 2.5% GP in broiler chicken diets improved gut morphology and modified the cecal bacterial community and blood biochemical profiles with no adverse effect on growth performance and meat quality.",

Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the DIC effect, modifying the pressure (0.2 and 0.4 MPa), the number of cycles (2 and 4), and grape pomace material (Malbec, Merlot, and Syrah) on extractable polyphenol (EPP) and NEPP contents. The EPP content increased during DIC application, an effect associated with the pressure, cycles, and initial polyphenol content. While for extractable and non-extractable proanthocyanidin contents, the main factors explaining the DIC effect are the pressure and number of cycles. Therefore, changes in polyphenols from grape pomace by DIC treatment are dependent upon experimental conditions, but the origin of the grape pomace also influences the extraction of EPP.",

Similar to other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, oxidative stress plays a key factor in the neurodegeneration process. To counteract the uncontrolled increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress-dependent cell death, several preclinical and clinical tests exploit natural-derived organic antioxidants, such as polyphenols. Despite some promising results, free antioxidants show scarce brain accumulation and may exhaust their scavenging activity before reaching the brain. In this work, we developed an antioxidant therapeutic nanoplatform consisting of nano-sized functionalized liposomes loaded with selected polyphenol-rich vegetal extracts with high blood-brain barrier crossing capabilities. The antioxidant extracts were obtained from the grape seeds and skins as a byproduct of wine production (i.e., pomace), following a sustainable circular approach with reduced environmental impact. The antioxidant nanoplatform was successfully tested in a relevant in vitro model of PD, where it completely rescued the ROS levels, prevented the aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils, and restored cell viability, paving the way for preclinical translation of the approach.",

The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of grape pomace supplementation on the expression of seven selected miRNAs and their potential relationship with the observed positive effect on glycaemic control, in order to shed light on the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of this dietary intervention. For this purpose, plasma samples were obtained from 49 subjects with metabolic syndrome. After supplementation with grape pomace (6 weeks), these subjects were categorised as responders (n = 23) or non-responders (n = 26) according to the changes in their fasting insulin rate. MiRNA expression at baseline and at the end of the supplementation was analysed by RT-PCR, and the MiRecords Database was used to identify potential target genes for the studied miRNAs. The increase observed in miR-23a in the whole cohort was present in both subgroups of participants. The increase in miR-181a was significant among non-responders but not responders. The decrease in miR-30c and miR-222 was found in the responders, but not in the non-responders. No changes were observed in miR-10a, miR-151a, miR-181a, and miR-let-7a expressions. After analysing these results, a potential involvement of the reduced expression of miR-30c and miR-222, two microRNAs associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, in the improvement of glycaemic control produced by grape pomace administration, can be proposed. Further research is needed to confirm the involvement of glycolytic enzymes, PI3K, AMPK, and IRS-1 in the effect of grape pomace, as suggested by the changes induced in microRNAs."

C57Bl/6 mice were given high fat diet (HFD) or western diet (WD) as models of obesity and hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis, respectively, with or without pomace supplementation (50-250 mg/day). Pomace inhibited food intake, and reduced serum leptin and body weight gain. Ectopic fat deposition was reduced, while white adipose tissue mass was preserved. In addition, pomace improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, prevented the development of adipose tissue inflammation, and reduced hepatic steatosis. Higher expression of genes involved in fatty acids transport and oxidation was observed in adipose tissue, while lipogenic genes were attenuated in the liver of pomace-treated mice. In WD-fed mice, pomace reduced the severity of hepatic steatosis and inflammation and improved blood lipid profile, but was ineffective in reversing hepatic damage of advanced NASH. In conclusion, pomace improved insulin sensitivity and reduced ectopic fat deposition, leading to a healthier metabolic profile. Pomace may hold the potential as a supplement with beneficial health outcomes for the prevention and treatment of hepatic steatosis and other obesity-related pathologies.",

      "abstract": "Food waste is a global problem due to its environmental and economic impact, so there is great demand for the exploitation of new functional applications. The winemaking process leads to an incomplete extraction of high-value compounds, leaving the pomace still rich in polyphenols. This study was aimed at optimising and validating sustainable routes toward the extraction and further valorisation of these polyphenols, particularly for cosmeceutical applications. New formulations based on red grape pomace polyphenols and natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDESs) were here investigated, namely betaine combined with citric acid (BET-CA), urea (BET-U) and ethylene glycol (BET-EG), in which DESs were used both as extracting and carrying agents for polyphenols. The flavonoid profile determined by HPLC-MS/MS analysis showed similar malvidin content (51-56 μg mL-1) in the DES combinations, while BET-CA gave the best permeation performance in Franz cells, so it was further investigated in 3D human keratinocytes (HaCat spheroids) injured with the pro-oxidant agent menadione. BET-CA treatment showed good intracellular antioxidant activity (IC50 0.15 ± 0.02 μg mL-1 in malvidin content) and significantly decreased (p < 0.001) the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8, improving cell viability. Thus, BET-CA formulation is worthy of investigation for potential use as a cosmetic ingredient to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are causes of skin aging.",

      "abstract": "Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut microbiota-derived metabolite recognized as strongly related to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), mainly increasing the risk of atherosclerosis development. Currently, no pharmacological approaches have been licensed for reduction of TMAO serum levels and conventional anti-atherosclerosis treatments only target the traditional risk factors, and the cardiovascular risk (CVR) still persist. This underlines the need to find novel targeted strategies for management of atherosclerosis. In this study we tested the ability of a novel nutraceutical formulation based on grape pomace polyphenols (Taurisolo®) in reducing both the serum levels of TMAO and oxidative stress-related biomarkers in humans (n = 213). After chronic treatment with Taurisolo® we observed significantly reduced levels of TMAO (-49.78 and -75.80%, after 4-week and 8-week treatment, respectively), oxidized LDL (oxLDL; -43.12 and -65.05%, after 4-week and 8-week treatment, respectively), and reactive oxygen species (D-ROMs; -34.37 and -49.68%, after 4-week and 8-week treatment, respectively). On the other hand, no significant changes were observed in control group. Such promising, the results observed allow indicating Taurisolo® as an effective nutraceutical strategy for prevention of atherosclerosis.

In this study, it was investigated whether fattening commercial rabbits during 30 days with a non-medicated feed, with 20% addition of grape pomace (GPD), affected production traits and the fatty acid composition, antioxidants properties, and the shelf life of the meat compared to a conventional strategy (CON). Furthermore, it was tested, by chromatographic analysis, whether this alternative diet allowed the transfer of phenolic compounds to the meat. Thirty-six weaned rabbits were allotted to the two treatments. In each treatment, 18 rabbits were fattened in three indoor cages, each housing three males and three female rabbits. No significant differences were found in live weights (p > 0.05), but the feed conversion rate and carcass weight and yield were found to be impaired in the GPD group (p ≤ 0.05). The GPD group had a higher intramuscular fat percentage (2.01 vs. 1.54), improved polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio (0.75 vs. 0.66), and better atherogenicity (0.71 vs. 0.83) and thrombogenicity (1.14 vs. 1.24) indexes, while the n-6/n-3 ratio was higher (25.4 vs. 20.3). Total volatile basic nitrogen in meat was lower in the GPD group (p = 0.01), suggesting a delayed spoilage. However, no improvements in total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, reducing power, and lipid oxidation (p > 0.05) were found in the meat. Even though the GPD pellets offered to the animals had several grape-derived phenolic compounds, and higher antioxidant properties compared to the CON diet, none of the phenolic compounds detected in feeds were detected in the meat samples."

At 0.2 MPa-60 s was observe an increase of total EPP and total anthocyanins. Despite the increment of EPP, was observe the lowest anthocyanins and non-extractable proanthocyanidins content at 0.4 MPa-120 s. This increase was due to a partial transformation of anthocyanins into phenolic acids and the depolymerization of proanthocyanidins. Also was observe partial solubilization of insoluble dietary fiber. Morphologically, the size of the pores generated by DIC was more significant at higher pressures. Thus, DIC modified the morphology and profile of the polyphenols of grape pomace, producing phenolic compounds of simpler structure and improving their antioxidant capacities.",

Birds (1825 ± 87 g of body weight) were divided into 12 dietary groups with six replicates per group (eight birds per replicate), under a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement 2 × 3 × 2 consisted of two levels of DTP (0 and 15%), three FSM levels (0, 4 and 8%) and two levels of DGP (0 and 5%). As a result of this study, there were no significant differences in egg production and weight as well in feed conversion ratio (FCR) among treatments (p > 0.05). Feeding of DGP reduced significantly feed intake and egg mass when compared to control group (p < 0.05). There was no effect (p > 0.05) of dietary treatment on shell thickness and strength, shape index, Haugh unit and egg specific gravity. Hens consuming 15% DTP and 5% DGP revealed a significantly higher yolk color compared to the other dietary treatments (p < 0.05). Moreover, there was no difference among dietary treatments in terms of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) cholesterol, atherogenic index, triglycerides, total cholesterol levels (p > 0.05). Serum antioxidant parameters as glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), total superoxide dismutase (TSOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were not influenced by treatments (p > 0.05). Based on findings, FSM and DTP supplements did not significantly impact most of hens' performance indicators and egg quality parameters, whereas significant improvements were observed by feeding of 15% DTP and 5% DGP on egg traits, in particular on egg-yolk color that plays a key-role in consumer's choice. However, the supplementation of FSM and DTP or DGP even in laying hen diet is still controversial and further research is needed.",

      "abstract": "Because of its high content of polyphenolic compounds, the dietary inclusion of grape pomace (GP) in ruminant diets can reduce reactive nitrogen (N) and methane emissions and enhance the shelf life and beneficial fatty acids (FAs) content of meat. However, the dietary inclusion of GP beyond a threshold that is still to be determined for feedlot cattle can also compromise nutrient supply and, thus, growth performance. This study investigated the optimum proportion of GP in finishing cattle diets. Nutrient intake and apparent total tract digestion, ruminal pH and fermentation, estimated microbial protein synthesis, route of N excretion, and blood metabolites were measured. Six ruminally fistulated crossbred beef heifers (mean initial body weight ± SD: 714 ± 50.7 kg) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with 21-d periods. Dietary treatments were 0%, 15%, and 30% of dietary dry matter (DM) as GP, with diets containing 84%, 69%, and 54% dry-rolled barley grain, respectively. There was a linear increase (P = 0.07) in DM intake and quadratic change (P ≤ 0.01) in neutral detergent fiber (NDF) intake. There was a quadratic change (P ≤ 0.04) in apparent total tract DM, NDF, and crude protein digestibility as dietary GP content increased. However, there were no treatment effects (P ≥ 0.18) on total ruminal short-chain FA concentration and duration and area pH < 6.2, 5.8, and 5.5. Although N intake did not differ (269, 262, 253 g/d; P = 0.33) across dietary treatments, feeding GP led to a tendency for a quadratic change (P ≤ 0.07) in ruminal ammonia-N and plasma urea-N concentrations. Total N excretion also changed (quadratic, P = 0.03) because of changes (quadratic, P = 0.02) in fecal N excretion as urinary excretion of N and urea-N did not differ (P ≥ 0.15) across treatments. Feeding GP led to quadratic changes (P ≤ 0.01) in fecal excretion of fiber-bound N. Microbial N flow and apparent N retention also changed (quadratic, P ≤ 0.04) as dietary GP proportion increased. In conclusion, responses to dietary GP proportion were mostly quadratic with indications that nutrient supply as reflected by changes in apparent total tract nutrient digestibility, microbial N supply, and apparent N retention could be compromised beyond a 15% dietary inclusion level.",

Grape pomace was fermented with Aspergillus niger for 7 d. In total, 140 one-day-old male chicks (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, with five replicates and seven birds each. Chickens were fed either a basal diet (CON) or the basal diet supplemented with 0.25 g/kg synthetic antioxidants (5% butylated hydroxytoluene, 1% butylated hydroxyanisole, and 11% ethoxyquin) (AO), or 15 g/kg GP (GP), or 15 g/kg FGP (FGP) for 42 d. Dietary GP raised serum glutathione peroxidase (p = 0.031) and superoxide dismutase (p = 0.021) levels, increased ileum lamina muscularis thickness (p = 0.016), and did not affect selected bacterial species in the cecum of broiler chickens. Dietary FGP improved body weight (p = 0.003), increased the serum catalase level (p = 0.032), and decreased the cecal Clostridium perfringens count (p = 0.033) but did not affect the ileal morphology of broiler chickens. The carcass parameters, malondialdehyde level, pH, and color of the breast meat of chickens were not changed by either GP or FGP supplementation. Chickens fed with the synthetic antioxidants had similar growth performance with the chickens fed with FGP but had better body weight (p = 0.003) and feed conversion ratio (p = 0.045) compared with the chickens fed with GP. The obtained results showed that FGP can be used as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants in broiler diets."

      "abstract": "Feedlot beef production in tropics and subtropics is being limited by shortage of feed ingredients due to prolonged droughts resulting in high prices of cereal grains and reduced profitability. To alleviate feed shortages and increase profitability for the feedlot industry, it is important to explore underutilized non-conventional resources such as fruit by-products. The current study compared the nutrient intake, digestibility and utilization effects of feeding either 150 g/kg of dried citrus pulp (DCP) or grape pomace (DGP) as alternative dietary fibre sources to 7 months-old Angus steers (281 ± 15.7 kg) under feedlot conditions. Twenty-four steers were assigned to three dietary treatments (8 steers/treatment) in a completely randomised design. Each steer was treated as an experimental unit. Steers were adapted to diets for 21 d followed by 7 d of sample collection during which nutrient intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation parameters, nitrogen retention and microbial N supply were determined. All the data were analysed using the GLIMMIX procedures. Overall, steers fed DGP had the greatest dry matter intake (DM), organic matter (OM) crude protein (CP), ash free neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom), ether extract (EE) and starch intake followed by DCP and control (CON) diets (P ≤ .05). Apparent digestibilities of DM, OM and aNDFom were higher (P ≤ .05) for DCP diet compared to DGP and CON diets. Feeding DCP and DGP diets increased ruminal concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, acetate and isovalerate, and acetate to propionate ratio, and reduced propionate concentrations compared to the CON diet (P ≤ .05). The steers fed the CON diet had the greatest urinary excretions of allantoin, uric acid and total purine derivatives followed by those fed the DCP and DGP diets (P ≤ .05). Nitrogen intake, faecal nitrogen (N), N retention and N efficiency utilization were in the order of DGP > DCP > CON diets (P ≤ .05). Overall, feeding DGP as alternative fibre source to wheat bran improved nutrient intake, retention and efficiency of N utilization but reduced apparent nutrient digestibility compared to DCP. Current finding suggests that DGP may be a better fibre substitute for wheat bran in beef diets than DCP.",

The ultrasound assisted extraction showed superior results when compared to conventional extraction, extraction averages were: 11% total phenolic compounds, 25% total anthocyanins. The extract obtained by ultrasound showed higher antioxidant capacity when compared to the one obtained by conventional extraction. The alginate-Ca2+ capsules were stable when stored in the presence or absence of light, with a reduced t1/2 (absence of light), indicating longer half-life in the absence of light.

Glucidex-transfersomes, glucidex-hyalurosomes and glucidex-hyalutransferomes were prepared, characterized and tested. Glucidex-liposomes were used as reference. All vesicles were small in size (~ 150 nm), homogeneously dispersed and negatively charged. Glucidex-transfersomes and especially glucidex-hyalutransfersomes disclosed an unexpected resistance to acidic pH and high ionic strength, as they maintained their physico-chemical properties (size and size distribution) after dilution at pH 1.2 simulating the harsh gastric conditions. Vesicles were highly biocompatible and able to counteract the oxidative damages induced in Caco-2 cells by using hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, they promoted the formation of Lactobacillus reuteri biofilm acting as prebiotic formulation. Overall results suggest the potential of glucidex-hyalutransfersomes as food supplements for the treatment of intestinal disorders.",

However, studies found the presence of ochratoxin A (OTA) in GP at very high concentrations, which raises a safety issue in the value-added utilization of GP. This study evaluated the effects of thermal pressure, baking, acid and enzymatic treatments on OTA content in GP. Thermal pressure treatment was conducted with wet GP at 121 °C for 10-30 min in an autoclave; acid treatments were conducted with hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, and lactic acid, respectively, at 50 °C for 24 h. Baking was conducted using a cookie model. For enzymatic treatment, purified OTA solution was treated with carboxypeptidase A, alcalase, flavourzyme, pepsin, and lipase, respectively, and the effective enzymes were selected to treat GP. Results show that autoclaving for 10-30 min reduced 19-80% of OTA, varying with treatment time and GP variety. The effectiveness of acid treatment was similar to that of autoclaving and varied with acid type and GP variety. Baking increased the detectable OTA. Among all tested enzymes, carboxypeptidase A was the most effective in reducing OTA, followed by lipase and flavourzyme, but their effects were significantly lower in GP samples.",

In order to overcome the side effects of currently used anti-inflammatory drugs, several attempts have been made to identify natural products capable of relieving RA symptoms. In this work, a herbal preparation consisting of propolis, pomegranate peel, and Aglianico grape pomace (PPP) extracts (4:1:1) was designed and evaluated for its effect on a murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Firstly, the chemical contents of four different Italian propolis collected in the Campania region (Italy) were here reported for the first time. LC-MS analyses showed the presence of 38 constituents, identified in all propolis extracts, belonging to flavonoids and phenolic acids classes. The Pietradefusi extract was the richest one and thus was selected to design the PPP preparation for the in vivo assay. Our results highlight the impact of PPP on RA onset and progression. By using in vivo CIA models, the treatment with PPP resulted in a delayed onset of the disease and alleviated the severity of the clinical symptoms. Furthermore, we demonstrated that early PPP treatment was associated with a reduction in serum levels of IL-17, IL-1b, and IL-17-triggering cytokines.",

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of inactivating GP condensed tannins using graded levels of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on feed intake, physiological, carcase, and meat quality traits of male Cobb 500 broilers. 2. Three hundred, two-week old, male Cobb 500 broilers (334.6 ± 21.43 g live weight) were allocated to 30 pens carrying 10 birds each. Five isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated for grower (14-35 d) and finisher (36-42 d) phases by diluting a commercial broiler diet with untreated GP (PEG0) at 6.5% (w/w) or with the same amount of GP but pre-treated with PEG at 2.5% (PEG1), 5% (PEG2), 10% (PEG3) or 15% (w/w) (PEG4) and randomly allocated to pens in a four-week feeding period. 3. Feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion efficiency (FCE), and blood, carcase and meat quality parameters were determined. Weekly weight gain and FCE linearly (P < 0.05) increased in week 4 and linearly (P < 0.05) decreased in week 6 in response to PEG treatment levels. 4. Mean corpuscular volume linearly (P < 0.05) decreased in response to PEG levels, whereas blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio, urea, total protein, globulin and cholesterol showed quadratic trends in response to PEG levels. Spleen and ileum weights tended (P < 0.1) to linearly decrease with PEG levels. Heart weight and meat redness tended (P < 0.1) to quadratically respond to increasing levels of PEG. 5. It was concluded that PEG treatment partially inactivated GP condensed tannins without compromising the health status of broiler chickens. An optimum PEG inclusion level could not be determined for feed intake, weight gain and FCE. However, the presence of other antinutrients such as fibre and low molecular weight phenolics in GP may be responsible for the linear decreases observed in this study.",

Grape pomace extracts are a rich source of polyphenols. In the present study, the polyphenols of two different types of grape pomace were characterized and identified by high‑performance liquid chromatography‑diode array detector, and the effect of polyphenol‑rich grape pomace extracts on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) osteogenic differentiation was investigated. Solid‑liquid extraction was used to recover polyphenols from red and white grape pomace. The two extracts have been characterized through the phenolic content and antioxidant power. Human MSCs (hMSCs) from the bone marrow were cultured both with and without given amounts (10 or 20 µg/ml) of the obtained pomace extracts. Their effects on cell differentiation were evaluated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, compared with relevant controls. Results showed that both pomace extracts, albeit different in phenolic composition and concentration, induced multiple effects on hMSC gene expression, such as a decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor κ‑Β ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio and an enhanced expression of genes involved in osteoblast differentiation, thus suggesting a shift of hMSCs towards osteoblast differentiation. The obtained results provided data in favor of the exploitation of polyphenol properties from grape pomace extracts as complementary active molecules for dental materials and devices for bone regeneration in periodontal defects.",

      "abstract": "The application of solid-state fermentation for the production of value-added products from the agro- and food-industry residues has been recently investigated greatly. The white-rot basidiomycete Trametes versicolor is a widely used fungi for the degradation lignocellulosic material in solid-state conditions. Grape pomace constitutes the major by-product of Vitis vinifera L. and is a source of compounds with recognized health benefits. In this study, a process for treating grape pomace with Trametes versicolor for 15 days under solid-state conditions was developed, and the phenolic profile and anti-inflammatory potential of the grape pomace extracts before and after treatment was studied. The anti-inflammatory potential of the grape pomace extracts was studied via tests based on the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase and hyaluronidase, two key enzymes in inflammatory processes. A total of 24 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified by HPLC methods. With the exception of anthocyanins, an increase in phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols and the flavonol rutin was observed after a treatment period of 1-4 days with T. versicolor. Moreover, the increase in the phenolic content was accompanied by an enhancement in the anti-inflammatory activity of the grape pomace extracts, which was confirmed by the strong correlation between them. This is the first study providing evidence of the benefits of the application of fungal-based solid-state fermentation as an environmentally friendly process for the enhancement of the phenolic composition and anti-inflammatory potential of grape pomace, increasing the possibility of profiting from the great waste produced by the grape-processing industry.",

This study investigated the effects of a commercially available grape pomace extract (GE) from Vitis vinifera on cisplatin-induced kidney toxicity in rats. Sixty-four male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into eight groups. Groups 1-3 were controls, receiving 0.9% saline and doses 1 and 2 of GE respectively. Cisplatin was given to groups 4-8. Two groups received pretreatment with GE, while another two groups received pre- and post-treatment with GE. Blood samples were collected and all animals sacrificed. Kidneys were harvested for histopathological analysis. GE significantly increased blood creatinine and urea levels, the severity of kidney histopathological damage, and mortality in all cisplatin groups, except for group 7 which received pre- and post-treatment with a low dose of GE. Renal toxicity was determined by mortality and severe histopathological renal lesions. Additionally, the serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was not significantly modified in the treated groups compared to the control. These results indicate that the GE did not have a protective effect on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity; on the contrary, GE accentuated the toxic effect of cisplatin."

CON containing 100 g/kg GP pre-treated with PEG (50 g/kg) and enzyme (1 g/kg) (PENZ). Overall body weight gains were similar in broilers reared on the CON, dPEG, ENZ and PENZ diets but lower in dGP chickens. The meat of birds reared on dPEG, ENZ, dGP and CON had a similar water-holding capacity, which was lower than in PENZ chickens. Diets influenced the size of duodenum, ileum, jejunum and caeca. Polyethylene glycol treatment promoted similar body weight gains and hot carcass weights as the commercial control diet, suggesting that the anti-nutritional effects of condensed tannins were successfully ameliorated."

The study investigated the effect of grape pomace (GPE) and seed (GSE) polyphenol extracts on the recovery of gut microbiota after antibiotic cocktail treatment in high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD together with antibiotic treatment by drinking water for 3 weeks. Then, GPE and GSE were supplemented for 7 days after withdrawal of antibiotics. The gut microbiota was characterized by a significant loss of diversity and certain important taxon after a 3-week antibiotic cocktail treatment. The GPE and GSE supplementation during the restore period of gut microbiota had some positive effects. The relative abundance of gut microbiota was improved by GPE and GSE compared to the spontaneous recovery group. And gut microbiota diversity was also greatly changed by GPE and GSE, being indicated by the changes of Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia in feces. These findings suggested that grape polyphenol extracts have a great influence on the recovery of gut microbiota after antibiotics and high-fat diet treatment."

The application of EM and Double pomace decreased the chromatic as well as the anthocyanin and anthocyanin-derived pigment composition of the wines. Large polymeric pigments were favored in EM and Double pomace wines, but the total polymeric pigment content was not improved by any of the winemaking treatments. The 6 months-EM wines showed a 13-fold (Pinot noir) and a 1.6-fold increase (Zinfandel) in tannins, respectively, relative to Control wines. However, the 1 month-EM and Double pomace treatments did not affect tannin levels, suggesting that in these wines, the extraction of tannins during EM may depend upon desorption of previously extracted tannins during extended contact time.",

      "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is recognized as a biomarker of increased cardiovascular risk. So far, the evaluation of TMAO serum levels in the clinical practice is limited due to the lack of developing new facile methods with reduced limitations. However, few approaches were achieved to determine TMAO in serum by using mass spectrometry-based technique, some limitations were reported including the use of internal standards. Therefore, in this work, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) based-assay was developed to evaluate the effect of grape pomace extract (Taurisolo®, group A) or Taurisolo®+pectin (group B) on TMAO serum levels in a cohort of overweight/obese subjects. The serum levels of TMAO have been assessed before and after treatment, through LC/MS analysis. After 8-week treatment, in both intervention groups TMAO serum levels significantly decreased (-78.58% p = 0.006 and -76.76% p = 0.001, group A and group B, respectively). Moreover, we performed several analyses aimed to validate the LC/MS method we used. The method has high precision (% C.V = from 12.12 to 3.92% and from 8.25 to 1.07% for intraday and interday, respectively) and accuracy (% bias = from -5.52 to 0.5% and from -1.42 to 3.08% for intraday and interday, respectively). TMAO recoveries from serum ranged from 99 to 97%; LOD: 2 ng/ml and LOQ: 6 ng/ml. In conclusion, we demonstrated the efficacy of a novel nutraceutical formulation in reducing TMAO serum levels in high cardiovascular risk-subjects, and proposed a useful, versatile and rapid LC/MS method for identification and quantization of TMAO, without the use of marked/isotopic internal standards. It, thus, may represent a novel and practical method with applications in clinical practice and nutraceutical research.

At the optimal region, the enzymatic treatment enhanced the extraction yield of phenolics by up to 66% and its antioxidant capacity by up to 80%, reducing the incubation time and enzyme doses in respect to previous studies. We found that tannase raises the antioxidant capacity of the extract by the liberation of gallic acid, while cellulose favours the liberation of p-coumaric acid and malvidin-3-O-glucoside. We also tested the procedure in different grape pomace varieties, verifying its wide applicability.",

      "abstract": "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is considered a novel risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Several studies demonstrated that polyphenols are able to inhibit the growth of TMA-producing bacterial strains, and resveratrol (RSV) reduced TMAO levels in mice. In the present study, we evaluated the TMAO-reducing effect of a novel nutraceutical formulation containing grape pomace extract in humans (Taurisolo®). The Taurisolo® polyphenol content was evaluated by a High Performance Liquid Chromatography-diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD) method, and RSV was monitored as an indicative marker. After in vitro GI digestion, intestinal bioaccessibility of RSV was 92.3%. A randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial was carried out to evaluate the TMAO-reducing effect of Taurisolo®. In acute, the maximum levels of RSV were detected both in serum and whole blood 60 min after the administration of Taurisolo®; in chronic, a significant increase of RSV was detected in serum after the 4-week treatment. After 4 weeks, the levels of TMAO were significantly decreased in the treatment group compared to placebo (63.6% vs. 0.54%, respectively, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, our data show that Taurisolo® may represent a novel and useful natural remedy to reduce prognostic markers for incident cardiovascular events. Undoubtedly, further in vitro and in vivo studies need to be performed in order to elucidate possible mechanisms of action and corroborate our preliminary results.",

The effect of pre- and probiotic combination has been less studied in IBD. Using genomic and proteomic array technologies, this study examined the efficacy of a new combination of natural alternatives: prebiotics (grape pomace extract, GP) and probiotics (lactobacilli mixture, Lb mix) on inflammation and intracellular signalling routes in a cellular model of inflammation. Caco-2 cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 4 h were treated with GP extract (50 μg/ml gallic acid equivalent) and Lb combination (3 × 108 colony-forming units/ml total Lb) for 24 h. The profile expressions of forty key inflammatory markers and twenty-six signalling kinases were analysed. Other markers involved in inflammation were also investigated (NF-κB/RELA, Nrf2, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, Cyp1A1, Cyp1B1); 57·5 and 60 % of investigated genes and proteins, respectively, were down-regulated by the synbiotic combination. Relevant cytokines and chemokines involved in response to microbial infection and inflammation were reduced under the level induced by LPS treatment and toward the unchallenged control. As expected, the reduction effect seems to imply mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB pathway. Most of the signalling molecules activated by LPS were decreased by GP extract and Lb mix. Our study indicates that the synbiotic combination of GP extract and Lactobacillus sp. mixture exerted anti-inflammatory properties, which are able to decrease the majority of inflammatory genes, their proteins and associated signalling markers. Due to protective role of GP compounds on lactobacilli probiotic, this synbiotic combination might serve as a promising adjunctive therapy in intestinal inflammations."

      "abstract": "Wine grape pomace flour (WGPF) is a fruit byproduct that is high in fiber and antioxidants. We tested whether WGPF consumption could affect blood biochemical parameters, including oxidative stress biomarkers. In a three-month intervention study, 27 male volunteers, each with some components of metabolic syndrome, consumed a beef burger supplemented with 7% WGPF containing 3.5% of fiber and 1.2 mg gallic equivalents (GE)/g of polyphenols (WGPF-burger), daily, during the first month. The volunteers consumed no burgers in the second month, and one control-burger daily in the third month. At baseline and after these periods, we evaluated the metabolic syndrome components, plasma antioxidant status (i.e., 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity (DPPH), vitamin E, vitamin C), and oxidative damage markers (i.e., advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs), malondialdehyde (MDA)). The WGPF-burger intake significantly reduced glycemia and homeostatic model assessment-based measurement of insulin resistance. Vitamin C increased and decreased during the consumption of the WGPF-burger and control-burger, respectively. The WGPF-burger intake significantly decreased AOPP and oxLDL levels. Vitamin E and MDA levels showed no significant changes. In conclusion, the consumption of beef burgers prepared with WGPF improved fasting glucose and insulin resistance, plasma antioxidant levels, and oxidative damage markers. Therefore, this functional ingredient has potential as a dietary supplement to manage chronic disease risk in humans.",

      "abstract": "Removal of total polyphenols (TPP) is not only necessary as a pretreatment stepfor anaerobic digestion of wine wastewaters (WWW) but also the recovered polyphenols can be used as a dietary supplement. With a view to make the process sustainable, eco-efficient and cost effective, exhausted grape pomace (EGP) after the extraction of polyphenols was impregnated with ZnCl2 (1:1.5) and further activated at 450 °C for 1 h under inert atmosphere. The GPAC (grape pomace activated carbon) thus developed exhibited well-developed porosity with a predominance of micropores, high surface area and selective surface binding sites. Batch adsorption conducted on diluted WWW revealed the better performance of GPAC (84.3% removal) as compared to EGP (48.5% removal) under similar conditions; with maximum adsorption taking place at pH 3.8. While pH studies indicated a possible electron-donor-acceptor mechanism in the binding of TPP, kinetic studies indicated that diffusion was mediated by the porosity in GPAC. Isotherm studies conducted on GPAC and commercial carbon (CAC) revealed multilayer binding under WWW while Langmuir model was operative under simulated conditions. Contrary to the better performance of CAC, the same for GPAC was comparable at higher dosage where >80%TPP was removed from undiluted WWW. The phenol adsorption capacity of GPAC from real (28.4 mg/g) and from simulated wastewater (142.6 mg/g) was higher as compared to other reported adsorbents. Desorption of TPP from loaded GPAC was maximum (∼91%) with 1:1 ethanol-water solvent. The results reveal a sustainable eco-friendly solution for valorisation of exhausted grape pomace for recovery of polyphenols from wine wastewater.",

      "abstract": "This experiment was conducted to explore the efficacy of grape pomace (Vitis vinifera) on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients, blood profile, and meat quality in commercial broilers. Four hundred broiler chicks (3-d-old) were randomly allotted to 4 dietary treatments for 28 d. Each treatment had 5 replicates with 20 birds per replicate. The dietary treatments were 1) control, 2) 5 g/kg grape pomace (GP), 3) 7.5 g/kg GP, and 4) 10 g/kg GP supplemented in diets after drying. Supplementation of GP did not show linear effects (P > 0.05) on body weight (BW) gain, however, quadratic effects (P < 0.05) on BW gain were observed during d 0 to 7 and d 8 to 14. Body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio remained unaffected during d 22 to 28 and overall period. The nutrient digestibility studies conducted at the end of the feeding trial did not show (P > 0.05) any effect due to GP supplementation, except a quadratic trend (P = 0.07) for digestibility of ash was observed. Serum levels of glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not affected (P > 0.05), however, total cholesterol and serum immunoglobulin G levels showed quadratic effects (P < 0.05) due to GP supplementation. The thio-barbituric acid reactive substances values in breast meat linearly decreased (P < 0.01) in supplemented groups at 0, 5, and 10 d of storage showing linear effects due to GP supplementation, and quadratic effects were also observed at 5 and 10 d of storage. The meat color value such as redness was also decreased (P < 0.05) in supplemented groups showing both linear and quadratic effects. Overall, it could be concluded that GP supplementation showed quadratic effects on BW gain during early growth stages and was effective in reducing serum cholesterol level and improving meat quality parameters in broilers."

The highest methane production (0.178Nm3kg-1 of COD) was attained after alkaline treatment with 10% NaOH w/w dry basis, at 20°C and for 24h. This result is due to the degradation of more than 50% of lignin and about 22% of cellulose present in grape pomace. The coupling of this pretreatment with freezing at -20°C exhibited the highest methane production of 0.2194±0.0007Nm3kg-1 of COD. When applied to a larger scale continuous digester, this coupled pretreatment increased methane production by about 27%, compared to the untreated samples, promoting the green valorization of the biomass.",

It is well recognized that PC do modulate the composition of the gut microbiota (GM), however, the literature still lacks significant data concerning the link between the metabolic fate of the ingested compounds and their bioactivity, mainly when considering the secondary metabolites produced. In this study, we assessed the metabolic fate of PC for a period covering 14 months of daily intake to identify the metabolites that could be responsible for the effects of PC on the GM observed in our previous work. Urinary analysis of polyphenol metabolites was performed using a high resolution mass spectrometry LC-QTOF-MS method. Among the sixteen metabolites identified, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid were detected simultaneously and, therefore, correlated with the growth of Bifidobacterium in the rat GM. In addition, Daidzedin, detected only at 14 months post-treatment, mostly interfered with the growth inhibition of Clostridium (Cluster I). In conclusion, the impact of the long-term intake of PC on rat GM seems to be related to specific metabolites produced after ingestion of the parental compounds and this may also be due to their additional synergistic effects."

Compositional analyses of untreated (UGP) and pretreated (PGP) grape pomace showed the effectiveness of pretreatment in removing non-cellulosic components, recovering 80.1% cellulose in PGP (compared to 19.3% of UGP). Scanning and transmission electron microscopies were used to evaluate the CNCs morphology. AH in combination with ultrasound treatment led to needle-shaped structures and apparently more dispersed suspensions. Crystallinity index and thermal stability were studied by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. The AH60S sample presented high aspect ratio, crystallinity and thermal stability. CNCs toxicity was evaluated by exposing Caco-2 cells to CNCs suspension and evaluating their viability. Results showed that CNCs are non-toxic, opening the opportunity for their use on food and pharmaceutical applications."

Thirty, 2-mo-old rats, were divided into 5 groups. Four groups were treated with different concentrations of PC (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/d diluted in 0.1% DMSO), and 1 group received 0.1% Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) alone (control group). The daily treatment lasted 14 mo. Major phenolic compounds constituents were characterized by the high-performance liquid chromatography and free radical scavenging capacity was measured by means of the DPPH assay. Fecal samples from young rats (2-mo old), and rats daily fed with PC or DMSO were collected at 6 and 14 mo posttreatment. The gut microbiota composition was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Bifidobacterium was significantly higher in the groups PC 2.5 and PC 5 than in control and young rats. Lactobacillus decreased with time in all treated and untreated groups. Bacteroides, Clostridium leptum subgroup (Clostridium cluster IV), and Enterococcus were not significantly changed by PC at any concentration when compared to control; nevertheless, after 14 mo of treatment all concentrations of PC abolished the increase of Clostridium sensu stricto (cluster I) (Clostridium Cluster I) observed in the control group when compared to young rats. PC do modulate selectively rat gut microbiome to a healthier phenotype in long-term feeding rats, and could counteract the adverse outcomes of aging on gut bacterial population. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This research shows that phenolic-rich grape pomace extracts exhibiting a high antioxidant activity, selectively modulate rat gut microbiota to a healthier phenotype within age in a long-term feeding rats.",

The two major wastes from winemaking process, pomace and lees account for 20 and 7% of the grapes, respectively. They have been expected as a valuable resource to be recycled because they are rich in polyphenols. Polyphenols possess prooxidatve activity as well as antioxidative one just like a two sides of a coin. A typical example of the prooxidative activity is antibacterial activity of catechins. The activity is exerted through oxidation of phenolic hydroxyl moiety coulpled with reduction of dissolved oxygen leading to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. In addition, once the oxidation of phenolic hydroxyl moiety is augmented by photoirradiation, highly reactive hydroxyl radical (·OH) is generated. Accordingly, there have been several reports showing that photoirardiation of polyphenols exerts bactericidal activity via ·OH generation.

      "abstract": "Grape pomace is a rich source of phenolic compounds commonly employed for elaboration of dietary supplements. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effect of a purified white grape pomace extract (PWGPE) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells and to characterize the underlying mechanism. Apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed by flow cytometry and protein expression levels were analysed by Western blotting. PWGPE induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The anticancer effect was associated with an increased expression of p73 and down-regulation of pro-survival factors, including p-Akt, Bcl-2, and survivin. PWGPE reduced the expression of several proteins that block the expression of apoptosis-related genes such as DNMT1, HDAC1/2, UHRF1, and the polycomb group protein members: EZH2, SUZ12, and BMI1. In addition, the extract induced the formation of ROS, whereas pre-treatment with PEG-catalase and N-acetylcysteine prevented the ROS formation and markedly decreased the induction of apoptosis. These findings suggest that PWGPE-induced apoptosis in Jurkat human leukemia cells, is mediated by mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 cleavage, and depends on ROS generation and regulation of epigenetic gene silencing. Therefore, PWGPE may play an important role in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that polyphenols have a significant potential in the prevention and treatment of risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. The objective of this study was to assess the metabolic outcomes of two polyphenol-containing extracts from cinnamon bark (CBE) and grape pomace (GPE) on C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk. Both CBE and GPE were able to decrease fat mass gain and adipose tissue inflammation in mice fed a HFD without reducing food intake. This was associated with reduced liver steatosis and lower plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels. We also observed a beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis, as evidenced by an improved glucose tolerance and a lower insulin resistance index. These ameliorations of the overall metabolic profile were associated with a significant impact on the microbial composition, which was more profound for the GPE than for the CBE. At the genus level, Peptococcus were decreased in the CBE group. In the GPE-treated group, several key genera that have been previously found to be linked with HFD, metabolic effects, and gut barrier integrity were affected: we observed a decrease of Desulfovibrio, Lactococcus, whereas Allobaculum and Roseburia were increased. In addition, the expression of several antimicrobial peptides and tight junction proteins was increased in response to both CBE and GPE supplementation, indicating an improvement of the gut barrier function. Collectively, these data suggest that CBE and GPE can ameliorate the overall metabolic profile of mice on a high-fat diet, partly by acting on the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "The present work aimed at optimizing a two-step enzymatic plus solvent-based process for the recovery of bioactive compounds from white grape (Vitis vinifera L., mix of Trebbiano and Verdicchio cultivars) pomace, the winemaking primary by-product. Phenolic compounds solubilised by water enzyme-assisted and ethanol-based extractions of wet (WP) and dried (DP) pomace were characterised for composition and tested for antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase and anti-inflammatory bioactivities. Ethanol treatment led to higher phenol yields than water extraction, while DP samples showed the highest capacity of releasing polyphenols, most probably as a positive consequence of the pomace drying process. Different compositions and bioactivities were observed between water and ethanol extracts and among different treatments and for the first time the anti-tyrosinase activity of V. vinifera pomace extracts, was here reported. Enzymatic treatments did not significantly improve the total amount of solubilised compounds; Celluclast in DP led to the recovery of extracts enriched in specific compounds, when compared to control. The best extracts (enzymatic plus ethanol treatment total levels) were obtained from DP showing significantly higher amounts of polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols and tannins and exerted higher antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase activities than WP total extracts. Conversely, anti-inflammatory capacity was only detected in water (with and without enzyme) extracts, with WP samples showing on average a higher activity than DP. The present findings demonstrate that white grape pomace constitute a sustainable source for the extraction of phytochemicals that might be exploited as functional ingredients in the food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries.",

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of tannase alone (T), pectinase plus cellulase (PC) or a mixture of them (TPC) on the hydrolysis of polyphenolics in red GP (RGP), white GP (WGP), and mixed GP (MGP) from Brazilian wine production, as well as antioxidant activity of the products. T was the most potent in increasing total polyphenols in GP by liberating gallic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, and trans-resveratrol. PC increased the catechin content in RGP and TPC increased the procyanidin B2 in WGP. T treatment of GP was most effective in increasing antioxidant activity. In conclusion, the enzymatic treatment, particularly with T, increases the polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity of GP."

      "abstract": "Hydrochar produced via hydrothermal carbonization of grape pomace was considered as novel sorbent of Pb(2+) from aqueous solution. In order to enhance the adsorption capacity, hydrochar was chemically modified using 2 M KOH solution. Both materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. Batch experiments were performed to examine the effect of sorbent dosage, pH and contact time. Obtained results showed that the KOH treatment increased the sorption capacity of hydrochar from 27.8 mg g(-1) up to 137 mg g(-1) at pH 5. Adsorption of lead on either of the materials was achieved through ion-exchange mechanism, chemisorption and Pb(2+)-π interaction. The Sips isotherm model gave the best fit with the experimental data obtained for Pb(2+) sorption using activated hydrochar. The adsorption kinetic followed a pseudo second-order model. Thermodynamic parameters implied that the Pb(2+) binding for hydrochar surface was spontaneous and exothermic process. Findings from this work suggest that the hydrothermal carbonization is a promising route for production of efficient Pb (2+) sorbents for wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet is a healthy diet with positive scientific evidence of preventing chronic diseases. Bioactive components support the healthy properties of the Mediterranean diet. Antioxidants and fiber, two components of the Mediterranean diet, are key functional nutrients for healthy eating and nutrition. Wine grape pomace is a rich source of these dietary constituents and may be beneficial for human health. Our hypothesis was that the intake of red wine grape pomace flour (WGPF) prepared from red wine grapes (Cabernet Sauvignon variety) reduced the metabolic syndrome in humans. To evaluate the effect of WGPF on components of metabolic syndrome we design a 16-week longitudinal intervention study. Thirty-eight males, 30-65 years of age, with at least one component of metabolic syndrome, were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 25) or the control group (n = 13). At lunch, the intervention group was given 20 g of WGPF per day, which contained 10 g of dietary fiber, 822 mg of polyphenols and an antioxidant capacity of 7258 ORAC units. Both groups were asked to maintain their regular eating habits and lifestyles. Clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements and biochemical blood analyses were done at the beginning and the end of the study. RESULTS: WGPF intake significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as fasting glucose levels. Plasma γ-tocopherol and δ-tocopherol increased and carbonyl group in plasma protein decreased in WGPT group, significantly. No significant effect was observed for waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, total antioxidant capacity and vitamin C in and between groups. The group-dependent magnitude of the differences between the baseline and final postprandial insulin values and γ-tocopherol concentrations was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of WGPF-rich in fiber and polyphenol antioxidants, as a food supplement in a regular diet improves blood pressure, glycaemia and postprandial insulin. In addition, increased antioxidant defenses and decreased oxidative protein damage indicating attenuation of oxidative stress. WGPF might be a useful food ingredient for health promotion and chronic disease prevention.",

      "abstract": "In a previous study, we demonstrated that a grape pomace extract (GPE) exerted antioxidant activity in endothelial (EA.hy926) and muscle (C2C12) cells through an increase in glutathione (GSH) levels. In the present study, in order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the antioxidant activity of GPE, its effects on the expression of critical antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD)1, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) were assessed in EA.hy926 and C2C12 cells. Moreover, the effects of GPE on CAT, SOD and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymatic activity were evaluated. For this purpose, the C2C12 and EA.hy926 cells were treated with GPE at low and non-cytotoxic concentrations (2.5 and 10 µg/ml for the C2C12 cells; 0.068 and 0.250 µg/ml for the EA.hy926 cells) for 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h. Following incubation, enzymatic expression and activity were assessed. The results revealed that treatment with GPE significantly increased GCS levels and GST activity in both the C2C12 and EA.hy926 cells. However, GPE significantly decreased CAT levels and activity, but only in the muscle cells, while it had no effect on CAT levels and activity in the endothelial cells. Moreover, treatment with GPE had no effect on HO-1 and SOD expression and activity in both cell lines. Therefore, the present results provide further evidence of the crucial role of GSH systems in the antioxidant effects exerted by GPE. Thus, GPE may prove to be effective for use as a food supplement for the treatment of oxidative stress-induced pathological conditions of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle systems, particularly those associated with low GSH levels.",

The use of tannase in these by-products, and pectinase in grape pomace changed the galloylated form of catechin to its free form, releasing gallic acid and increasing the antioxidant activity. In grape pomace, cellulase treatment was not efficient for phenolic release and antioxidant activity improvement. The addition of carbohydrases to grape pomace, either alone or in combination, degraded the cell wall polysaccharides, increasing the content of monosaccharides.

High voltage electrical discharges (HVED) were applied for intensification of the extraction. The effects of the energy input, the electrodes distance gap and the liquid-to-solid ratio were studied. Diffusion was then carried out in different mixtures of water and ethanol for one hour at 20, 30, 40 and 60°C. The most efficient extraction was (i) an HVED pre-treatment at 80kJ/kg with an electrodes distance of 5mm in a liquid-to-solid ratio of 5 followed by (ii) a diffusion with 30% ethanol in water at 60°C for 30min. The highest total polyphenols content reached 2.8±0.4gGAE/100gDM with a corresponding antioxidant activity of 66.8±3.1gTEAC/kgDM. The polyphenols extraction rate increased with temperature in accordance to an Arrhenius type of relationship: activation energy of 21.5±1.1kJ/mol for HVED treated systems against 0.5±0.2kJ/mol for untreated ones."

      "abstract": "Norton grape is one of the most important wine grapes in Southern and Midwestern states and generates massive pomace byproducts. The objective of this study is to characterize the antioxidant compounds and activity in Norton grape pomace extract (GPE) and further assess the potential health promoting properties of Norton GPE using an animal disease model. The total phenolic content and anthocyanins in Norton GPE were 475.4 mg of gallic acid equiv/g and 156.9 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/g, respectively. Catechin and epicatechin in GPE were 28.6 and 24.5 mg/g, respectively. Other major antioxidants in GPE included quercetin (1.6 mg/g), trans-resveratrol (60 μg/g), gallic acid (867.2 μg/g), coutaric acid (511.8 μg/g), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (408.3 μg/g), and protocatechuic acid (371.5 μg/g). The antioxidant activity of GPE was evaluated by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and was 4133 μmol of Trolox equiv/g. Male diet-induced obese (DIO) mice were randomly divided to three treatment groups (n = 12): a normal diet (ND group), a high fat diet (HF group), and the high fat diet supplemented with GPE (HFGPE group). After 12-week treatment, mice in the high fat diet groups gained 29% more weight than the ND group. The GPE supplementation (estimated 250 mg/kg bw/d) lowered plasma C-reactive protein levels by 15.5% in the high fat diet fed mice (P < 0.05), suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect by dietary GPE. However, dietary GPE did not improve oxidative stress in DIO mice as determined by plasma ORAC, glutathione peroxidase, and liver lipid peroxidation. The results showed that GPE contained significant antioxidants and dietary GPE exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in diet induced obesity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postprandial hyperglycemia is an early defect of type 2 diabetes and one of primary anti-diabetic targets. Treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia can be achieved by inhibiting intestinal α-glucosidase, the key enzyme for oligosaccharide digestion and further glucose absorption. Grape pomace is winemaking byproduct rich in bioactive food compounds such as phenolic antioxidants. This study evaluated the anti-diabetic potential of two specific grape pomace extracts by determining their antioxidant and anti-postprandial hyperglycemic activities in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The extracts of red wine grape pomace (Cabernet Franc) and white wine grape pomace (Chardonnay) were prepared in 80% ethanol. An extract of red apple pomace was included as a comparison. The radical scavenging activities and phenolic profiles of the pomace extracts were determined through the measurement of oxygen radical absorbance capacity, DPPH radical scavenging activity, total phenolic content and flavonoids. The inhibitory effects of the pomace extracts on yeast and rat intestinal α-glucosidases were determined. Male 6-week old C57BLKS/6NCr mice were treated with streptozocin to induce diabetes. The diabetic mice were then treated with vehicle or the grape pomace extract to determine whether the oral intake of the extract can suppress postprandial hyperglycemia through the inhibition of intestinal α-glucosidases. RESULTS: The red grape pomace extract contained significantly higher amounts of flavonoids and phenolic compounds and exerted stronger oxygen radical absorbance capacity than the red apple pomace extract. Both the grape pomace extracts but not the apple pomace extract exerted significant inhibition on intestinal α-glucosidases and the inhibition appears to be specific. In the animal study, the oral intake of the grape pomace extract (400 mg/kg body weight) significantly suppressed the postprandial hyperglycemia by 35% in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice following starch challenge. CONCLUSION: This is the first report that the grape pomace extracts selectively and significantly inhibits intestinal α-glucosidase and suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. The antioxidant and anti-postprandial hyperglycemic activities demonstrated on the tested grape pomace extract therefore suggest a potential for utilizing grape pomace-derived bioactive compounds in management of diabetes."
