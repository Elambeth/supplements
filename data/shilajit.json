      "abstract": "Chemotherapy has been ineffective in cancer treatment, and efficient delivery of chemotherapeutic agents remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a doxorubicin-loaded shilajit-based nanocarrier (SHN-Dox) using a nanoprecipitation method to enhance Dox uptake into breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and ZR-75-1). After confirmation of the physicochemical properties of the nanocarriers, the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of SHN-Dox and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated on breast cancer cells. SHN-Dox showed a spherical shape with a size of 244 nm and a sustainable release profile of Dox. It exhibited high cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells, effectively inducing DNA fragmentation in these cells. After 24 h of treatment, SHN-Dox increased the apoptosis rate in MCF-7 cells and raised ROS levels. Therefore, SHN-Dox is a promising carrier that might reduce the side effects of Dox on healthy cells and provide a new strategy for clinical cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder without a cure, despite the enormous number of investigations and therapeutic approaches. AD is a consequence of microglial responses to \"damage signals\", such as aggregated tau oligomers, which trigger a neuro-inflammatory reaction, promoting the misfolding of cytoskeleton structure. Since AD is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly (>60 years old), new treatments are essential to improve the well-being of affected subjects. The pharmaceutical industry has not developed new drugs with efficacy for controlling AD. In this context, major attention has been given to nutraceuticals and novel bioactive compounds, such as molecules from the Andean Shilajit (AnSh), obtained from the Andes of Chile. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and mouse neuroblastoma cells were evaluated to examine the functional and neuroprotective role of different AnSh fractions. Our findings show that AnSh fractions increase the number and length of neuronal processes at a differential dose. All fractions were viable in neurons. The AnSh fractions inhibit tau self-aggregation after 10 days of treatment. Finally, we identified two candidate molecules in M3 fractions assayed by UPLC/MS. Our research points to a novel AnSh-derived fraction that is helpful in AD. Intensive work toward elucidation of the molecular mechanisms is being carried out. AnSh is an alternative for AD treatment or as a coadjuvant for an effective treatment."

      "abstract": "Various therapies for osteoporosis successfully reduce bone loss and fractures, but they mostly do not contribute to new bone structures and adversely affect patients. Shilajit is a natural mineral substance comprised of multi-components, with proved efficacy to improve immunity, antioxidant activity, and disease resistance. In the present study, various effects of shilajit water extract (SWE) on bone development and its management were determined in experimental glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic rats. The fabrication of nanochitosan (NCT) and NCT conjugation with SWE were conducted and evaluated as enhanced formulations for treating osteoporosis. NCT and SWE/NCT had mean particle diameters of 196.4 and 248.4 nm, respectively, with high positivity charging and stability. The biochemical and anti-osteoporotic effects of SWE and SWE/NCT conjugates were investigated on different groups of compromised rats. Five groups each including six adult albino female rats were formed and treated for a duration of eight weeks with SWE and SWE/NCT conjugate. Significantly improved serum calcium, phosphorus, osteocalcin, and calcitonin levels but decreased hydrogen peroxide, IL-6, and antioxidant biomarkers were recorded in all SWE- and SWE/NCT-treated groups; the SWE/NCT treatment was most effectual treatment. These results suggest that SWE and SWE/NCT may cause anti-osteoporotic activity by reducing oxidative stress, IL-6, and H2O2 while restoring antioxidant levels. The conjugation of SWE onto NCT is highly recommended for augmenting their activities."

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant cancer of the bone identified by the direct formation of osteoid tissue or immature bone by cancer cells. The liver and kidneys represent two major secondary organs to which osteosarcoma metastasizes. In this study, we assessed Shilajit, a phytomineral diffusion traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine, for its possible protective effects against metastasis induced liver and kidney damages in an osteosarcoma rat model. Osteosarcoma rats displayed typical dysregulation of serum levels of hepatic and renal functional markers (p < 0.05) including aspartate aminotransferase (AST)* and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total proteins, albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, urea, and uric acid. Changes in functional markers were also positively correlated with marked histopathological alterations in liver and kidney tissues. Whereas Shilajit's treatment of osteosarcoma rates in combination with CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy drug cocktail significantly (p < 0.05) reversed the studied functional markers to their near-normal levels. Co-treatment of shilajit and drug cocktails also markedly alleviated histopathological changes in liver and kidney tissues. Correlation co-efficient analysis of hepatic and renal functional markers revealed a significant inter-association among these markers. Collectively, present data indicate that shilajit may potentiate the effects of chemotherapy drugs and mitigate the metastasis-induced liver and kidney damage in osteosarcoma. Thus, the findings of this study substantiate the beneficial health effects of shilajit and promote its regular consumption."

      "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the neuroprotective effect of shilajit extract in experimental head trauma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three groups of 33 Sprague Dawley Albino strain male rats were included in the study. Group 1 (n=11): trauma but not treated. Group 2 (n=11): trauma and treated with 0.5 mL / rat saline Group 3 (n=11): 150 mg / kg shilajit extract was administered intraperitoneally in the treatment of trauma. Following the head trauma, the indicated treatments were applied to the 2nd and 3rd groups at the first, twenty-four and forty-eighth hours. Brain tissues and blood samples were taken after the control animals were sacrificed at the 72nd hour in all groups after trauma. Sections prepared from cerebral cortex and ca1 region were examined with hematoxylin eosin and luxol fast blue staining. Total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant capacity and oxidative stress index were measured from blood samples taken after routine procedures. RESULTS: The number of red neurons and the severity of edema were significantly higher in both the cerebral cortex and the ca1 region in the group treated with trauma only and in the group administered saline after trauma compared to the group that received shilajit extract after trauma. The total antioxidant capacity increased significantly in blood samples taken only from the group treated with trauma and saline in post-trauma treatment compared to the group given post-traumatic shilajit extract, while shilajit extract given due to traumatic brain injury significantly decreased the total oxidant capacity and oxidative stress index values compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: Shilajit extract has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect in the treatment of acute traumatic brain injury. Our study showed that shilajit may be a useful option in the treatment of secondary brain injury, in humans.",

METHODS: After establishing fatty liver models by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, 35 Wistar male rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, including control (standard diet), Veh (HFD + vehicle), high-dose Shilajit [H-Sh, HFD + 250 mg/(kg·d) Shilajit], low-dose Shilajit [L-Sh, HFD + 150 mg/(kg·d) Shilajit], and pioglitazone [HFD + 10 mg/(kg·d) pioglitazone] groups, 7 rats in each group. After 2-week of gavage administration, serum levels of glucose, insulin, interleukin 1beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), adiponectin, and resistin were measured, and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) was calculated. RESULTS: After NAFLD induction, the serum level of IL-10 significantly increased and serum IL-1β, TNF-α levels significantly decreased by injection of both doses of Shilajit and pioglitazone (P<0.05). Increases in serum glucose level and homeostasis model of HOMA-IR were reduced by L-Sh and H-Sh treatment in NAFLD rats (P<0.05). Both doses of Shilajit increased adiponectin and decreased serum resistin levels (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The probable protective role of Shilajit in NAFLD model rats may be via modulating the serum levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, adipokine and resistin, and reducing of HOMA-IR.",

Cytotoxicity of Mumio was analysed in these cell lines via MTT and real-time cell growth assays as well via the assessment of the cytoskeleton, apoptosis, and cell cycle. Mumio affected the viability of both cell types in a time and concentration dependent manner. We observed a selectivity of Mumio against cancer cells. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis showed that Mumio inhibited G0/G1 or S phase cell cycle, which in turn induced apoptosis. Our results showed that Mumio was significantly more cytotoxic to urinary bladder cancer cells than to normal cells.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Shilajit, a medicine of Ayurveda, on the liver damage caused by NAFLD. Materials and methods Forty male Wistar rats, after being established as fatty liver models by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD, 12 weeks), were divided randomly into five groups as follows: control (standard diet), vehicle (HFD + distilled water), high-dose Shilajit (HFD + 250 mg/kg Shilajit), low-dose Shilajit (HFD + 150 mg/kg Shilajit) and pioglitazone (HFD + 10 mg/kg pioglitazone). The serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glucose and liver glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, liver weight, and histopathological manifestation outcomes were measured after the 2-week intervention. Results Shilajit treatment significantly reduced the values of AST and ALT, TG, TC, LDL, glucose, liver weight, and steatosis, and instead, increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.05). Further, Shilajit treatment improved the adverse effects of HFD-induced histopathological changes in the liver as compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.001). MDA level and GPx activity increased but SOD activity decreased in the vehicle group compared with the control group (p < 0.05), while treatment with Shilajit restored the antioxidant/oxidant balance toward a significant increase in the antioxidant system in the Shilajit group (p < 0.05). Conclusions These findings suggest that Shilajit improved the histopathological NAFLD changes in the liver and indicated the potential applicability of Shilajit as a potent agent for NAFLD treatment.",

Therefore, the present investigation was designed to assess the effectiveness of Shilajit for treatment of male infertility resulting from exposure to perilous chemicals. Effect of daily oral administration (p.o.) of Shilajit (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg/Kg BW) was investigated for a single spermatogenic cycle (35 days) in cadmium-induced (2 mg/Kg BW, p.o. for 35 days) infertile adult (12-14 week) swiss male mice. Shilajit treatment increased weights of reproductive organs, testicular daily sperm production, activities of testicular Δ5 3β-HSD and 17 β-HSD enzymes and serum level of testosterone. Histopathological evaluation of testis revealed that Shilajit restored spermatogenesis as reflected by a gradual augmentation in germ cell layers with increased doses of Shilajit compared to cadmium-treated mice. Further, Shilajit treatment reverted back the adverse effects of cadmium on motility and concentration of spermatozoa. Secretory activities of the epididymis and seminal vesicle and libido, fertility and the number of litters per female were also improved by Shilajit in cadmium-treated mice. Results thus suggest the potent androgenic nature of Shilajit and its role in fertility improvement against cadmium-induced infertility.",

AIM: To investigate whether SJ possesses antiepileptic and antipsychotic activities in rodents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isonicotinyl hydrazine (INH), pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), apomorphine, phenytoin, diazepam, haloperidol and other chemicals of analytical grade were procured from standard companies. The antiepileptic activity of SJ was assessed using maximal electro shock (MES)-induced seizures in rats, INH and PTZ-induced seizures in mice. The antipsychotic effect of SJ was evaluated using apomorphine-induced climbing and stereotyped behaviours respectively, in mice and rats. SETTINGS AND DESIGNS: SJ (25 and 50 mg/kg, p.o.) was given orally once daily for 15 days in all the rodent models. On the test day, SJ was administered 1 h prior to electric shock or chemical inducers (INH/PTZ/apomorphine) in experimental animals; the animals were then observed for different phases of seizures and psychotic behaviours. In addition, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in the brain of rats and mice was estimated in seizure models. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The data were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean. Statistical comparisons were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test using Graph Pad Prism version 5.0, USA. A P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: SJ pretreatment significantly inhibited the seizures induced by MES, INH and PTZ in a dose dependent manner. Further, SJ augmented brain GABA levels to normal, decreased by INH and PTZ in mice brain. SJ pretreatment also significantly inhibited the climbing and stereotyped behaviours induced by apomorphine. The present data seems to confirm the antiepileptic activity of SJ which may be because of enhancing the GABAergic system. The antipsychotic activity observed may be due to anti-dopaminergic and/or GABA-mimetic actions."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Canc er is the second leading cause of death in children in developed countries and most of childhood malignancies can be treated with chemo-radiotherapy. Although radiation therapy is a successful treatment modality in cancer patients, it has various adverse effects. Especially the gonads are very sensitive and prone to radiation-related damage. Radiation impairs the ovaries by triggering apoptosis of follicular cells and chromosomal damage and oxidative stress. Shilajit, a traditional medicinal agent in India, Russia, and other parts of the world, contains various antioxidant agents and has ovogenic effects. To evaluate the ability of shilajit to prevent radiation-induced ovarian damage. METHODS: Forty Wistar albino female rats were divided into four groups as: Control group, shilajit group, radiation only group, and radiation + shilajit group. Four days after radiation exposure, the rats were sacrificed and the ovaries were removed and evaluated immuno-histopathologically. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in follicle counts (primordial, primary, preantral, antral, and atretic follicles) between the groups (p < 0.001). Almost all follicles at all stages were atretic in the radiation only group whereas normal-looking primordial follicles were detected in the radiation + shilajit group. In radiation + shilajit group, p53, Bax and caspase 3 expression was less intense than that in the radiation only group follicles. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported study evaluating the effects of shilajit on radiation-related ovarian damage prevention. Shilajit decreased the expression of p53, Bax, and caspase 3, thereby blocking the apoptotic pathways. Shilajit was found to be especially protective of primordial follicles.",

Animals were divided into control, M250, and M500 (received mumie at dosages of 250 and 500 mg/kg/day, orally for 7 days, respectively) main groups each consisting of two subgroups-with and without heart injury. On the 6th and 7th days, isoproterenol (ISO) (85 mg/kg i.p.) was injected (s.c.) to half of the animal subgroups to induce myocardial damage. On the 8th day, after hemodynamic parameter recordings, hearts were removed for further evaluation. Mumie pre-treatment had no significant effects on hemodynamic and cardiac indices of normal animals. When the cardiac injury was induced, mumie maintained the ±dp/dt maximum, attenuated the serum cardiac troponin I, and reduced the severity of cardiac lesions. Despite the mild positive effects of mumie on total antioxidant capacity and lipid proxidation index, no significant difference was observed among animal groups. The findings suggest the prominent cardioprotective effect of mumie against destructive effects of ISO. It seems that other mechanisms than reinforcements of antioxidant system are involved in this beneficial effect.",

In this review we discuss the potential contributions of shilajit and complex B vitamins to AD prevention. We analyze the status of biological studies and present data of a clinical trial developed in patients with mild AD.

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shilajit has been used as a rejuvenator for ages in Indian ancient traditional medicine and has been validated for a number of pharmacological activities. AIM OF THE STUDY: The effect of processed shilajit which was standardized to dibenzo-α-pyrones (DBPs;0.43% w/w), DBP-chromoproteins (DCPs; 20.45% w/w) and fulvic acids (56.75% w/w) was evaluated in a rat model of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The mitochondrial bioenergetics and the activity of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were evaluated for the plausible mechanism of action of shilajit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CFS was induced by forcing the rats to swim for 15mins for 21 consecutive days. The rats were treated with shilajit (25, 50 and 100mg/kg) for 21 days before exposure to stress procedure. The behavioral consequence of CFS was measured in terms of immobility and the climbing period. The post-CFS anxiety level was assessed by elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Plasma corticosterone and adrenal gland weight were estimated as indices of HPA axis activity. Analysis of mitochondrial complex chain enzymes (Complex I, II, IV and V) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) were performed to evaluate the mitochondrial bioenergetics and integrity respectively. RESULTS: Shilajit reversed the CFS-induced increase in immobility period and decrease in climbing behavior as well as attenuated anxiety in the EPM test. Shilajit reversed CFS-induced decrease in plasma corticosterone level and loss of adrenal gland weight indicating modulation of HPA axis. Shilajit prevented CFS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by stabilizing the complex enzyme activities and the loss of MMP. Shilajit reversed CFS-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress in terms of NO concentration and, LPO, SOD and catalase activities. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that shilajit mitigates the effects of CFS in this model possibly through the modulation of HPA axis and preservation of mitochondrial function and integrity. The reversal of CFS-induced behavioral symptoms and mitochondrial bioenergetics by shilajit indicates mitochondria as a potential target for treatment of CFS.",

It is a potent and very safe dietary supplement, restoring the energetic balance and potentially able to prevent several diseases. Recent investigations point to an interesting medical application toward the control of cognitive disorders associated with aging, and cognitive stimulation. Thus, fulvic acid, the main active principle, blocks tau self-aggregation, opening an avenue toward the study of Alzheimer's therapy. In essence, this is a nutraceutical product of demonstrated benefits for human health. Considering the expected impact of shilajit usage in the medical field, especially in the neurological sciences, more investigations at the basic biological level as well as clinical trials are necessary, in order to understand how organic molecules of shilajit and particularly fulvic acid, one of the active principles, and oligoelements act at both the molecular and cellular levels and in the whole organism."

Initially, 60 infertile male patients were assessed and those having total sperm counts below 20 million ml(-1) semen were considered oligospermic and enrolled in the study (n = 35). PS capsule (100 mg) was administered twice daily after major meals for 90 days. Total semenogram and serum testosterone, luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were estimated before and at the end of the treatment. Malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker for oxidative stress, content of semen and biochemical parameters for safety were also evaluated. Twenty-eight patients who completed the treatment showed significant (P < 0.001) improvement in spermia (+37.6%), total sperm count (+61.4%), motility (12.4-17.4% after different time intervals), normal sperm count (+18.9%) with concomitant decrease in pus and epithelial cell count compared with baseline value. Significant decrease of semen MDA content (-18.7%) was observed. Moreover, serum testosterone (+23.5%; P < 0.001) and FSH (+9.4%; P < 0.05) levels significantly increased. HPLC chromatogram revealed inclusion of PS constituents in semen. Unaltered hepatic and renal profiles of patients indicated that PS was safe at the given dose.

Extracts of Shilajit contain significant amounts of fulvic acid (FA), and it has been suggested that FA is responsible for many therapeutic properties of Shilajit. However, little is known regarding the physical and chemical properties of Shilajit extracts, and nothing is known about their effects on the complement system. To address this issue, extracts of commercial Shilajit were fractionated using anion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. One neutral (S-I) and two acidic (S-II and S-III) fractions were isolated, characterized and compared with standardized FA samples. The most abundant fraction (S-II) was further fractionated into three sub-fractions (S-II-1 to S-II-3). The van Krevelen diagram showed that the Shilajit fractions are the products of polysaccharide degradation, and all fractions, except S-II-3, contained type II arabinogalactan. All Shilajit fractions exhibited dose-dependent complement-fixing activity in vitro with high potency. Furthermore, a strong correlation was found between the complement-fixing activity and carboxylic group content in the Shilajit fractions and other FA sources. These data provide a molecular basis to explain at least part of the beneficial therapeutic properties of Shilajit and other humic extracts.",

      "abstract": "Although some promising results have been achieved by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, an effective therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease still remains an important goal. Sitoindosides VII-X, and withaferin-A, isolated from aqueous methanol extract from the roots of cultivated varieties of Withania somnifera (known as Indian Ginseng), as well as Shilajit, a pale-brown to blackish brown exudation from steep rocks of the Himalaya mountain, are used in Indian medicine to attenuate cerebral functional deficits, including amnesia, in geriatric patients. The present investigation was conducted to assess whether the memory-enhancing effects of plant extracts from Withania somnifera and Shilajit are owing to neurochemical alterations of specific transmitter systems. Therefore, histochemistry to analyse acetylcholinesterase activity as well as receptor autoradiography to detect cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor subtypes were performed in brain slices from adult male Wistar rats, injected intraperitoneally daily with an equimolar mixture of sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin-A (prepared from Withania somnifera) or with Shilajit, at doses of 40 mg/kg of body weight for 7 days. Administration of Shilajit led to reduced acetylcholinesterase staining, restricted to the basal forebrain nuclei including medial septum and the vertical limb of the diagonal band. Systemic application of the defined extract from Withania somnifera, however, led to differential effects on AChE activity in basal forebrain nuclei: slightly enhanced AChE activity was found in the lateral septum and globus pallidus, whereas in the vertical diagonal band AChE activity was reduced following treatment with sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin-A. These changes were accompanied by enhanced M1-muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding in lateral and medial septum as well as in frontal cortices, whereas the M2-muscarinic receptor binding sites were increased in a number of cortical regions including cingulate, frontal, piriform, parietal and retrosplenial cortex. Treatment with Shilajit or the defined extract from Withania somnifera affected neither GABAA and benzodiazepine receptor binding nor NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptor subtypes in any of the cortical or subcortical regions studied. The data suggest that Shilajit and the defined extract from Withania somnifera affect preferentially events in the cortical and basal forebrain cholinergic signal transduction cascade. The drug-induced increase in cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptor capacity might partly explain the cognition-enhancing and memory-improving effects of extracts from Withania somnifera observed in animals and humans.",
