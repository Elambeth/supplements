      "abstract": "Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, constitutes an effective and widely used treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, challenges such as insufficient oral bioavailability, gastrointestinal side effects, and high costs persist. Overcoming these limitations is essential for improving patient compliance and semaglutide's safety profile. While advanced technologies such as oral delivery systems offer partial solutions, optimizing the peptide structure is crucial for addressing these issues. Establishing a rapid method to generate a large library of semaglutide mutants will enable high-throughput activity screening. In this study, we introduce a novel \"Fits-In-All\" approach that combines ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) technology with amber stop codon incorporation to generate semaglutide variants. To counter dipeptidyl peptidase-4-mediated cleavage, our method strategically incorporates noncanonical amino acid ornithine at position 8 utilizing microbial modification enzyme OspR in vivo. Furthermore, functional groups are introduced by an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair recognizing the amber stop codon at position 26, which enabled the click chemistry-based linkage of diverse groups. This approach allows for the generation of a broad array of semaglutide analogues that can be screened for optimal properties. In conclusion, this innovative approach opens new avenues for the design and synthesis of optimized peptide-based GLP-1 receptor agonists."

      "abstract": "Soil salinization has emerged as a major factor negatively affecting soil quality and plant productivity. Proline, functioning as an osmotic regulator, has been proposed as an effective strategy for enhancing plant tolerance to salt stress. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous proline on salt tolerance in soybeans. A hydroponic experiment was conducted with different salt treatments (without NaCl, -NaCl; with 100 mM NaCl, +NaCl) and with or without 150 mM proline (+Pro, -Pro). The results showed that proline application alleviated salt stress-induced reductions in plant growth, photosynthetic parameters, and chlorophyll content while aiding recovery from leaf chlorosis. Proline treatment improved ion homeostasis by reducing Na+ levels and increasing K+ and Ca2+ contents in the leaves. Salt stress increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, along with leaf peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities, while decreasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Moreover, salt stress obviously enhanced proline accumulation, accompanied by increases in glutamate (Glu), glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA), and pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) content, as well as the activities of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) in the glutamate pathway, while reducing proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) activity. Exogenous proline treatment further elevated proline content and increased key substances and enzyme activities in both the glutamate (Glu and P5C content, P5CS and P5CR activity) and ornithine (Orn content and OAT activity) pathways while also reducing ProDH activity. Collectively, our results revealed that exogenous proline contributed to an attenuation of salt stress in soybeans by regulating both the glutamate and ornithine pathways to stimulate endogenous proline accumulation, mediate Na+/K+ homeostasis, and inhibit oxidative damage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous researches mainly focused on whether cancer stem cells exist in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, subgroups with dismal prognosis and stem cell-like characteristics have been overlooked. METHODS: Using large scale data (n = 2133), we conducted machine learning algorithms to identify a high risk DLBCL subgroup with stem cell-like features, and then investigated the potential mechanisms in shaping this subgroup using transcriptome, genome and single-cell RNA-seq data, and in vitro experiments. RESULTS: We identified a high-risk subgroup (25.6 % of DLBCL) with stem cell-like characteristics and dismal prognosis. This high-risk group (HRG) was featured by upregulation of key enzyme (ODC1) in polyamine metabolism and cold tumor microenvironment (TME), and had a poor prognosis with lower 3-year overall survival (OS) (54.3 % vs. 83.6 %, P < 0.0001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (42.8 % vs. 74.7 %, P < 0.0001) rates compared to the low-risk group. HRG also exhibited malignant proliferative phenotypes similar to Burkitt lymphoma. Patients with MYC rearrangement, double-hit, double-expressors, or complete remission might have either favorable or poor prognosis, which could be further distinguished by our risk stratification model. Genomic analysis revealed widespread copy number losses in the chemokine and interferon coding regions 8p23.1 and 9p21.3 in HRG. We identified ODC1 as a therapeutic vulnerability for HRG-DLBCL. Single-cell analysis and in vitro experiments demonstrated that ODC1 overexpression enhanced DLBCL cell proliferation and drove macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype. Conversely, ODC1 inhibition reduced DLBCL cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and promoted macrophage polarization towards the M1 phenotype. Finally, we developed a comprehensive database of DLBCL for clinical application. CONCLUSIONS: Our study effectively advances the precise risk stratification of DLBCL and reveals that ODC1 and immune-deserted microenvironment jointly shape a group of DLBCL patients with stem cell-like features. Targeting ODC1 regulates immunotherapies in DLBCL, offering new insights for DLBCL treatment."

      "abstract": "Despite few studies focusing on the OAZ2 gene in colorectal cancer, its potential role in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) prognosis and immune modulation remains underexplored. This study examines the expression and mechanistic involvement of OAZ2 in COAD using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and additional laboratory experiments. We employed uni- and multivariate Cox hazard regression analyses to evaluate its prognostic significance and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify related signaling pathways. Our findings demonstrate significantly lower OAZ2 expression in COAD tissues compared to normal counterparts (P < 0.05) and establish its value as an independent prognostic indicator (P < 0.05). Laboratory experiments further revealed that the protein and mRNA levels of OAZ2 are significantly diminished in COAD compared to adjacent normal tissues, while its antagonist AZIN2 shows elevated expression, suggesting a competitive interaction that may regulate tumor behavior. Overexpression of OAZ2 in RKO colorectal cancer cells significantly reduced their proliferation rate and impaired migration, confirming the functional impact of OAZ2 dysregulation in COAD. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) highlighted the involvement of OAZ2 in cardiac muscle contraction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Additionally, OAZ2's association with immune features such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and immune infiltration underscores its integral role in the tumor microenvironment. These comprehensive findings position OAZ2 as a promising biomarker for COAD prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention, with evidence supporting its regulatory effects on cell dynamics and tumor aggressiveness.",

      "abstract": "The role of the intestinal microbiome in Crohn's disease (CD) treatment remains poorly understood. This study investigates microbe-host interactions in CD patients undergoing ustekinumab (UST) therapy. Fecal metagenome, metabolome, and host transcriptome data from 85 CD patients were analyzed using multi-omics integration and mediation analysis. Our findings reveal significant microbiome-metabolite-host interactions. Specifically, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was linked to altered L-ornithine biosynthesis, resulting in higher L-ornithine levels in patients before UST therapy. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that microbiome-derived L-ornithine enhances UST treatment sensitivity in CD by disrupting the host IL-23 receptor signaling and inhibiting Th17 cell stabilization through the IL-12RB1/TYK2/STAT3 axis. L-ornithine significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of UST in CD patients, as demonstrated in a prospective clinical trial. These findings suggest that targeting specific microbe-host metabolic pathways may improve the efficacy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatments."

There are also cases suggesting capecitabine improves hyperammonaemia from 5-FU. We present the case of an older man taking capecitabine, who presented to our hospital with severe encephalopathy with elevated ammonia. Workup led to the diagnosis of a urea cycle disorder. This case highlights the importance of determining the aetiology of a patient's presentation, especially if they have presented repeatedly with the same issue.

However, the mechanisms of hepatic toxicity induced by pazopanib are not entirely clarified. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were treated with pazopanib every day for 2, 4, or 8 weeks. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of liver tissues were performed. In vitro experiments were carried out to estimate cell viability, apoptosis, and autophagy in L02 cells after Paz treatment. We also examined apoptosis and autophagy-related genes under 4-PBA, l-ornithine, nor-NOHA treatments, and HSPA5 knockdown. KEY FINDINGS: Repeated Paz treatment for 8 weeks resulted in more severe hypofunction of the liver in mice. Moreover, Paz treatment inhibited L02 cells cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. We also discovered activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, and autophagy in Paz-treated L02 cells, as evidenced by the boosted expression of HSPA5, p-IRE1α, ATF4, ATF6, p-eIF2α, LC3, Beclin-1, and a decrease of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, and mTOR levels. Moreover, 4-PBA, l-ornithine, and HSPA5 knockdown inhibited apoptosis and autophagy, while nor-NOHA weakened the effects of HSPA5 knockdown on apoptosis in Paz-treated L02 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study revealed that Paz-induced liver toxicity is related to HSPA5 expression and l-ornithine metabolism pathway in mice.",

Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is the most common urea cycle disorder, which is due to mutations in the OTC gene located on chromosome Xp21.1. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and genetic characteristics of 8 Chinese children diagnosed with OTCD. METHODS: A total of 8 patients (5 male and 3 female) were diagnosed with OTCD by biochemical and molecular analysis between 2015 and 2023. Clinical manifestations, biochemical features, and OTC gene sequencing analysis were reviewed retrospectively. The effect of c.664-1G>C on OTC mRNA synthesis was confirmed by a minigene splicing assay. RESULTS: All children were late-onset patients, with a median onset age of 3.6 years (range 1.8-17 years). Neurologic symptoms caused by hyperammonemia include vomiting, coma, dyssomnia, and seizures. The peak plasma ammonia levels ranged from 149 to 4,490 μmol/L, and alanine transaminase levels ranged from 20 to 1316 U/L. Four of them had received CRRT, and only 1 patient was admitted for liver transplantation. By December 2023, 4 patients had survived and 4 were deceased. Blood amino acids or urinary organic acids were detected in 7 cases. All patients underwent whole-exome sequencing, and 2 novel mutations were revealed (P1, c.617dupT and P2, c.664-1G>C). The alteration (c.664-1G>C) leads to the deletion of a 54-bp sequence in the exon 7 of the OTC gene (NM_000531.6: c.664_717del). DISCUSSION: Two novel pathogenic variants in the OTC gene were confirmed in 8 Chinese children by biochemical findings and genetic analysis. These findings will provide a better understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with OTCD."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical manifestations, laboratory testing, and genetic test findings of ten children with OTCD admitted between August 2015 and October 2021 at Quanzhou Maternity and Children's Hospital of Fujian Province in China. RESULTS: Five boys presented with early-onset symptoms, including poor appetite, drowsiness, groaning, seizures, and liver failure. In contrast, five patients (one boy and four girls) had late-onset gastrointestinal symptoms as the primary clinical manifestation, all presenting with hepatic impairment, and four with hepatic failure.Nine distinct variants of the OTC gene were identified, including two novel mutations: c.1033del(p.Y345Tfs*50) and c.167T > A(p.M56K). Of seven patients who died, five had early-onset disease despite active treatment. Three patients survived, and two of them underwent liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of OTCD lack specificity. However, elevated blood ammonia levels serve as a crucial diagnostic clue for OTCD. Genetic testing aids in more accurate diagnosis and prognosis assessment by clinicians. In addition, we identified two novel pathogenic variants and expand the mutational spectrum of the gene OTC, which may contribute to a better understanding of the clinical and genetic characteristics of OTCD patients.",

      "abstract": "The current treatment options for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are limited due to a lack of significant high-level evidence to inform clinical decisions and unfavorable outcomes in terms of cost-effectiveness and amputation rates. In order to suggest the use of the commercially available L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate (LOLA) for treating PAD, we induced hind limb ischemia (HLI) by unilaterally ligating the femoral artery in a rat model. The rats were randomly divided into three groups, with seven rats assigned to each group: group 1 (control), group 2 (sorbitol), and group 3 (LOLA). Intraperitoneal injections were administered five times on post-operative days (PODs) 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12. Perfusion imaging was conducted on PODs 7 and 14 and compared to pre-operative perfusion imaging. Immunohistochemistry staining and Western blotting were performed after the final perfusion imaging. Group 3 showed a significant increase in perfusion, high CD31-positive capillary lumen density, and substantial overexpression of VEGF in the ischemic limb during the subacute phase of HLI. In conclusion, this study provides the first documented evidence of angiogenesis and perfusion recovery in the subacute phase of the HLI model following the administration of LOLA. With LOLA readily available on the commercial market, the implementation of LOLA treatment for PAD in humans can be expedited compared to other therapies still in the developmental stage."

      "abstract": "The gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GACR) is a rare genetic disease for which no definitive cure is available. GACR is due to the deficit of ornithine aminotransferase (hOAT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme responsible for ornithine catabolism. The hallmark of the disease is plasmatic ornithine accumulation, which damages retinal epithelium leading to progressive vision loss and blindness within the fifth decade. Here, we characterized the biochemical properties of tetrameric and dimeric hOAT and evaluated hOAT loaded in red blood cells (RBCs) as a possible enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for GACR. Our results show that (i) hOAT has a relatively wide specificity for amino acceptors, with pyruvate being the most suitable candidate for ornithine catabolism within RBCs; (ii) both the tetrameric and dimeric enzyme can be loaded in RBC retaining their activity; and (iii) hOAT displays reduced stability in plasma, but is partly protected from inactivation upon incubation in a mixture mimicking the intracellular erythrocyte environment. Preliminary ex vivo experiments indicate that hOAT-loaded RBCs are able to metabolize extracellular ornithine at a concentration mimicking that found in patients, both in buffer and, although with lower efficiency, in plasma. Overall, our data provide a proof of concept that an RBC-mediated ERT is feasible and can be exploited as a new therapeutic approach in GACR.",

This study aims to address the effect of ornithine aspartate (LOLA) and vitamin E (VitE) in improving these processes. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to five groups and treated for 28 weeks: controls (n = 10) received a standard diet (for 28 weeks) plus gavage with distilled water (DW) from weeks 16 to 28. MASLD groups received a high-fat and choline-deficient diet for 28 weeks (MASLD group) and daily gavage with 200 mg/kg/day of LOLA, or twice a week with 150 mg of VitE from weeks 16-28. LOLA diminished collagen deposition (p = 0.006). The same treatment diminished carbonyl, TBARS, and sulfhydryl levels and GPx activity (p < 0.001). Type 3 deiodinase increased in the MASLD group, downregulating T3-controlled genes, which was corrected in the presence of LOLA. LOLA also promoted a near-normalization of complex II, SDH, and GDH activities (p < 0.001) and improved reticulum stress, with a reduction in GRP78 and HSPA9/GRP75 protein levels (p < 0.05). The enhanced energy production and metabolism of thyroid hormones, probably because of GSH replenishment provided by the L-glutamate portion of LOLA, opens a new therapeutic approach for MASLD.",

Severe HFMD poses a significant threat to the life and well-being of children. Numerous studies have indicated that the occurrence of severe HFMD is associated with cytokine storm. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying cytokine storm development remains elusive, and there are currently no safe and effective treatments available for severe HFMD in children. METHODS: In this study, we established a mouse model of severe HFMD to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving cytokine storm. We specifically analyzed metabolic disturbances, focusing on arginine/ornithine metabolism, and assessed the potential therapeutic effects of spermine, an ornithine metabolite. RESULTS: Our results identified disturbances in arginine/ornithine metabolism as a pivotal factor driving cytokine storm onset in severe HFMD cases. Additionally, we discovered that spermine effectively mitigated the inflammatory injury phenotype observed in mice with severe HFMD. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying severe HFMD from a metabolic perspective while offering a promising new strategy for its safe and effective treatment.",

Studies suggest ornithine aspartate (LOLA) as drug therapy. AIM: To analyze the influence of LOLA intake on gut microbiota using a nutritional model of MASLD. METHODS: Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: Control (10 rats fed with a standard diet), MASLD (10 rats fed with a high-fat and choline-deficient diet), and LOLA (10 rats receiving 200 mg/kg/d LOLA, after the 16th week receiving high-fat and choline-deficient diet). After 28 wk of the experiment, animals were euthanized, and feces present in the intestine were collected. Following fecal DNA extraction, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified followed by sequencing in an Ion S5™ system. RESULTS: Alpha and beta diversity metrics were comparable between MASLD and LOLA. 3 OTUs were differentially abundant between MASLD and LOLA, which belong to the species Helicobacter rodentium, Parabacteroides goldsteinii, and Parabacteroides distasonis. The functional prediction provided two different metabolic profiles between MASLD and LOLA. The 9 pathways differentially abundant in MASLD are related to a change in energy source, adenosine/purine nucleotides degradation as well as guanosine and adenosine deoxyribonucleotides biosynthesis. The 14 pathways differentially abundant in LOLA are associated with four major metabolic functions primarily influenced by L-aspartate, including tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways, purine/guanosine nucleotides biosynthesis, pyrimidine ribonucleotides biosynthesis and salvage as well as lipid IVA biosynthesis. CONCLUSION: Although LOLA had no influence on alpha and beta diversity in this nutritional model of MASLD, it was associated with changes in specific gut microbes and their related metabolic pathways."

      "abstract": "l-Ornithine- l-aspartate (LOLA) reduces toxic ammonium (NH3) plasma levels in hepatic encephalopathy. NH3 detoxification/excretion is achieved by its incorporation into urea and glutamine via activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CSP1) by l-ornithine and stimulation of arginase by l-aspartate. We aimed at identifying additional molecular targets of LOLA as a potential treatment option for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In primary hepatocytes from NAFLD patients, urea cycle enzymes CSP1 and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) increase, while the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) decreases with disease severity. In contrast, LOLA increased the expression rates of the BCAA enzyme transcripts bcat2, bckdha, and bckdk. In untreated HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells and HepG2-based models of steatosis, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome (the latter for the first time established herein), LOLA reduced the release of NH3; beneficially modulated the expression of genes related to fatty acid import/transport (cd36, cpt1), synthesis (fasn, scd1, ACC1), and regulation (srbf1); reduced cellular ATP and acetyl-CoA; and favorably modulated the expression of master regulators/genes of energy balance/mitochondrial biogenesis (AMPK-α, pgc1α). Moreover, LOLA reconstituted the depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, while retaining mitochondrial integrity and avoiding induction of superoxide production. Most effects were concentration-dependent at ≤40 mM LOLA. We demonstrate for l-ornithine-l-aspartate a broad range of reconstituting effects on metabolic carriers and targets of catabolism/energy metabolism impaired in NAFLD. These findings strongly advocate further investigations to establish LOLA as a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective basic medication for preventing and/or alleviating NAFLD."

Patients show a high level of ornithine in body fluids which may be controlled by low protein diets. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation may also be effective, however, most patients appear to be nonresponsive to this modality of treatment. CASE REPORT: Here, we report a characterized case of a vitamin B6-responsive GACR who had a splicing mutation in the OAT gene. The GACR diagnosis was confirmed through the clinical features, imaging, biochemical findings, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) results. WES data revealed the splicing mutation in intron 4 of the OAT gene (NM_001322967: c.425-1G>A). CONCLUSION: Our knowledge about the diagnosis and treatment of GACR can be improved by identifying novel mutations in the OAT gene and accurate follow-up of the patients to determine how they respond to treatment."

      "abstract": "Human ornithine aminotransferase (hOAT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, has been shown to play an essential role in the metabolic reprogramming and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC accounts for approximately 75% of primary liver cancers and is within the top three causes of cancer death worldwide. As a result of treatment limitations, the overall 5-year survival rate for all patients with HCC is under 20%. The prevalence of HCC necessitates continued development of novel and effective treatment methods. In recent years, the therapeutic potential of selective inactivation of hOAT has been demonstrated for the treatment of HCC. Inspired by previous increased selectivity for hOAT by the expansion of the cyclopentene ring scaffold to a cyclohexene, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of novel fluorinated cyclohexene analogues and identified (R)-3-amino-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid as a time-dependent inhibitor of hOAT. Structural and mechanistic studies have elucidated the mechanism of inactivation of hOAT by 5, resulting in a PLP-inactivator adduct tightly bound to the active site of the enzyme. Intact protein mass spectrometry, 19F NMR spectroscopy, transient state kinetic studies, and X-ray crystallography were used to determine the structure of the final adduct and elucidate the mechanisms of inactivation. Interestingly, despite the highly electrophilic intermediate species conferred by fluorine and structural evidence of solvent accessibility in the hOAT active site, Lys292 and water did not participate in nucleophilic addition during the inactivation mechanism of hOAT by 5. Instead, rapid aromatization to yield the final adduct was favored.",

We report a patient with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) who developed hyperammonemic encephalopathy after a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old woman with a 1.3-cm right adrenal incidentaloma causing mild autonomous cortisol secretion underwent a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test for confirming adrenocorticotropic hormone independency. On the next day, she presented to the emergency room with confusion and somnolence. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10 on arrival. The initial laboratory results showed ammonia, alanine transaminase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels of 289.51 (18.73-54.5) μg/dL, 21 (≤33) IU/L, 0.6 (0.6-1.1) mg/dL, and 13 (7-20) mg/dL, respectively. Electroencephalography showed triphasic morphology with no pathologies on brain imaging. Her husband told us that her brother and son had died in the neonatal period. On further review of medical records, we found that she was diagnosed as an OTCD carrier. We administered L-arginine, L-carnitine, rifaximin, and continuous renal replacement therapy. After 3 days, the serum ammonia level was 78.34 μg/dL with an increased Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, and electroencephalography abnormalities disappeared. DISCUSSION: Liver diseases and urea cycle disorders are the leading causes of hyperammonemia. This causes encephalopathy and death if the ammonia levels are too high. X-linked OTCD urea cycle disorder affects men more severely as they have only the carrier X chromosome. Glucocorticoids can exacerbate this disorder because they increase protein substrates converted to ammonia. CONCLUSION: This case reminds that it may be particularly important to have a complete medical history when administering glucocorticoids."

      "abstract": "Despite the well-known relevance of polyamines to many forms of life, little is known about how polyamines regulate osteogenesis and skeletal homeostasis. Here, we report a series of in vitro studies conducted with human-bone-marrow-derived pluripotent stromal cells (MSCs). First, we show that during osteogenic differentiation, mRNA levels of most polyamine-associated enzymes are relatively constant, except for the catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), which is strongly increased at both mRNA and protein levels. As a result, the intracellular spermidine to spermine ratio is significantly reduced during the early stages of osteoblastogenesis. Supplementation of cells with exogenous spermidine or spermine decreases matrix mineralization in a dose-dependent manner. Employing N-cyclohexyl-1,3-propanediamine (CDAP) to chemically inhibit spermine synthase (SMS), the enzyme catalyzing conversion of spermidine into spermine, also suppresses mineralization. Intriguingly, this reduced mineralization is rescued with DFMO, an inhibitor of the upstream polyamine enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1). Similarly, high concentrations of CDAP cause cytoplasmic vacuolization and alter mitochondrial function, which are also reversible with the addition of DFMO. Altogether, these studies suggest that excess polyamines, especially spermidine, negatively affect hydroxyapatite synthesis of primary MSCs, whereas inhibition of polyamine synthesis with DFMO rescues most, but not all of these defects. These findings are relevant for patients with Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS), as the presenting skeletal defects-associated with SMS deficiency-could potentially be ameliorated by treatment with DFMO.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese pedigree affected with co-morbid Ornithine carbamoyl transferase deficiency (OTCD) and MECP2 duplication syndrome. METHODS: A proband who was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Gansu Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital on December 19, 2017 was selected as the study subject. High-throughput sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were carried out for her pedigree, and short tandem repeat-based linkage analysis and chromosome copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) were used for the prenatal diagnosis. RESULTS: The proband, a 3-day-old female, was found to harbor heterozygous deletion of exons 7-9 of the OTC gene. Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the variant was classified as likely pathogenic (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PP4). The proband was diagnosed with OTCD , which was in keeping with her acute encephalopathy and metabolic abnormalities (manifesting as hyperammonemia, decreased blood citrulline, and increased urine orotic acid). Prenatal diagnosis was carried out for the subsequent pregnancy. The fetus did not harbor the exons 7-9 deletion of the OTC gene, but was found to carry a duplication in Xq28 region (which encompassed the whole region of MECP2 duplication syndrome) and was positive for the SRY sequence. The same duplication was also found in the proband and her mother. Considering the possible existence of X-chromosome inactivation, the proband was diagnosed with two X-linked recessive disorders including OTCD and MECP2 duplication syndrome, and the fetus was determined as a male affected with the MECP2 duplication syndrome. CONCLUSION: Discoveries of the pathogenic variants underlying the OTCD and MECP2 duplication syndrome have enabled clinical intervention, treatment, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for this pedigree.",

The efficacy of L-ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) for the treatment of HE is well known but its role in MHE remains uncertain. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate the efficacy of LOLA for the treatment of MHE in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Ovid databases were searched. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of LOLA with placebo or no intervention for the treatment of MHE in patients with cirrhosis were included from inception to January 2023. The primary outcomes were reversal of MHE and development of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). RESULTS: Overall, six RCTs comprising 292 patients were included. Compared with placebo or no intervention, LOLA was more effective in reversing MHE (RR = 2.264, 95 % CI = 1.528, 3.352, P = 0.000, I2 = 0.0 %) and preventing progression of OHE (RR = 0.220, 95 % CI = 0.076, 0.637, P = 0.005, I2 = 0.0 %). Based on subgroup analyses, oral LOLA treatment appeared more likely to reverse MHE (RR = 2.648, 95 % CI = 1.593, 4.402, P = 0.000, I2 = 0.0 %), intravenous LOLA treatment yielded a similar probability of reversing MHE (RR = 1.669, 95 % CI = 0.904, 3.084, P = 0.102, I2 = 0.0 %). LOLA did not show a superior possibility in reducing mortality (RR = 0.422, 95 % CI = 0.064, 2.768, P = 0.368, I2 = 0.0 %) and ammonia levels (SMD = 0.044, 95 % CI = -0.290, 0.379, P = 0.795, I2 = 0.0 %) compared with placebo or no intervention. CONCLUSIONS: LOLA has significant beneficial effects on reversal of MHE and prevention of OHE in patients with cirrhosis compared with placebo or no intervention.",

      "abstract": "Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiencies are rare urea cycle disorders, which can lead to life-threatening hyperammonemia. Liver transplantation (LT) provides a cure and offers an alternative to medical treatment and life-long dietary restrictions with permanent impending risk of hyperammonemia. Nevertheless, in most patients, metabolic aberrations persist after LT, especially low plasma citrulline levels, with questionable clinical impact. So far, little is known about these alterations and there is no consensus, whether l-citrulline substitution after LT improves patients' symptoms and outcomes. In this multicentre, retrospective, observational study of 24 patients who underwent LT for CPS1 (n = 11) or OTC (n = 13) deficiency, 25% did not receive l-citrulline or arginine substitution. Correlation analysis revealed no correlation between substitution dosage and citrulline levels (CPS1, p = 0.8 and OTC, p = 1). Arginine levels after liver transplantation were normal after LT independent of citrulline substitution. Native liver survival had no impact on mental impairment (p = 0.67). Regression analysis showed no correlation between l-citrulline substitution and failure to thrive (p = 0.611) or neurological outcome (p = 0.701). Peak ammonia had a significant effect on mental impairment (p = 0.017). Peak plasma ammonia levels correlate with mental impairment after LT in CPS1 and OTC deficiency. Growth and intellectual impairment after LT are not significantly associated with l-citrulline substitution.",

A window of opportunity lies in early diagnosis as there are currently no reliable biomarkers. CA 19-9 is one of the most frequently used biomarkers of PC, with 75 and 77.6% sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp), respectively, and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) shows 39.5 and 81.3% of Se and Sp, respectively. A case-control study was conducted including adult patients with a histological diagnosis of PC (n=11) without previous treatment at the Oncology Service of the CMNO-IMSS between 2019 and 2020, and a control group of adult volunteers (n=11) who were clinically healthy or with controlled disease including hypertension, hypothyroidism and diabetes. Clinical, laboratory and sociodemographic data as well as blood, urine and saliva samples were collected following patient consent. Polyamines were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, CA 19-9 and CEA were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the protein expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was evaluated using western blotting. Polyamine metabolism and modulation by means of ODC were increased in the serum and saliva of patients with PC, and the expression of ODC alone was increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The present study focused on the evaluation of putrescine, spermine, spermidine and ODC in PBMCs associated with CA 19-9 and CEA as an auxiliary tool in PC diagnosis."

In females, the phenotype is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to neurologic compromise secondary to hyperammonemia and it can be prompted by numerous triggers, including pregnancy. Objective: the objective of this article is to report a case of two pregnancies of an OTCD-carrier, and to review the literature describing OTCD and pregnancy, parturition and postpartum. Methods: an extensive search in PubMed in December 2021 was conducted using different search terms. After screening all abstracts, 23 papers that corresponded to our inclusion criteria were identified. Results: the article focuses on the management of OTCD during pregnancy, parturition, and the postpartum period in terms of clinical presentation, ammonia levels and treatment. Conclusions: females with OTCD can certainly plan a pregnancy, but they need a careful management during delivery and particularly during the immediate postpartum period. If possible, a multidisciplinary team of physicians, dietitians, obstetrician-gynecologist, neonatologists, pharmacists, etc. with expertise in this field should participate in the care of women with OTCD and their children during this period and in their adult life.",

      "abstract": "Hyperammonemia is a rare and often fatal complication following the conditioning therapy in autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. It is characterized by anorexia, vomiting, lethargy and coma without any other apparent cause. The diagnosis is often delayed because symptoms can be subtle and ammonia is usually not included among the routine analyzes. Previous reports have not identified the molecular mechanisms behind hyperammonemia in stem cell transplant recipients. Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are inborn errors of metabolism leading to hyperammonemia that usually presents in early childhood, whereas first presentation in adults is less common. Here we describe an adult woman with hyperammonemia following autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma. No apparent cause of hyperammonemia was identified, including portosystemic shunting, liver dysfunction or recent hyperammonemia-inducing chemotherapy. Hyperammonemia, normal blood glucose as well as anion gap and a previous history of two male newborns that died early after birth, prompted biochemical and genetic investigations for a UCD. A heterozygous variant in the X-linked gene encoding ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) was identified and was regarded as a cause of UCD. The patient improved after treatment with nitrogen scavengers and high caloric intake according to a UCD protocol. This case report suggests that UCD should be considered as a possible cause of hyperammonemia following stem cell transplantation.",

Patients present with hyperammonemia causing neurological symptoms, which can lead to coma and death. Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative therapy, but has several limitations including organ shortage, significant morbidity and requirement of lifelong immunosuppression. This study aims to identify the characteristics and outcomes of patients who underwent LT for OTCD. We conducted a retrospective study for OTCD patients from 5 UK centres receiving LT in 3 transplantation centres between 2010 and 2022. Patients' demographics, family history, initial presentation, age at LT, graft type and pre- and post-LT clinical, metabolic, and neurocognitive profile were collected from medical records. A total of 20 OTCD patients (11 males, 9 females) were enrolled in this study. 6/20 had neonatal and 14/20 late-onset presentation. 2/20 patients had positive family history for OTCD and one of them was diagnosed antenatally and received prospective treatment. All patients were managed with standard of care based on protein-restricted diet, ammonia scavengers and supplementation with arginine and/or citrulline before LT. 15/20 patients had neurodevelopmental problems before LT. The indication for LT was presence (or family history) of recurrent metabolic decompensations occurring despite standard medical therapy leading to neurodisability and quality of life impairment. Median age at LT was 10.5 months (6-24) and 66 months (35-156) in neonatal and late onset patients, respectively. 15/20 patients had deceased donor LT (DDLT) and 5/20 had living related donor LT (LDLT). Overall survival was 95% with one patient dying 6 h after LT. 13/20 had complications after LT and 2/20 patients required re-transplantation. All patients discontinued dietary restriction and ammonia scavengers after LT and remained metabolically stable. Patients who had neurodevelopmental problems before LT persisted to have difficulties after LT. 1/5 patients who was reported to have normal neurodevelopment before LT developed behavioural problems after LT, while the remaining 4 maintained their abilities without any reported issues. LT was found to be effective in correcting the metabolic defect, eliminates the risk of hyperammonemia and prolongs patients' survival."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked urea cycle disorder. In females - undergoing random X chromosomal inactivation (XCI) - disease severity depends on the XCI pattern. Hence, female OTCD subjects with favorable XCI display normal OTC expression and activity and are healthy carriers. Whereas females undergoing less favorable XCI may suffer from severe and fatal OTCD. In approximately 20% of patients with biochemical evidence of OTCD, no mutation can be identified hampering definitive diagnosis and adequate treatment.Here, we describe a female patient with high suspicion of OTCD in whom molecular genetic work-up did not reveal pathogenic variants in the OTC gene. In her case, this was particularly challenging, since she was awaiting liver transplantation due to metabolic instability. In order to substantiate the suspected diagnosis of OTCD, we applied our previously reported in vitro OTCD liver disease model. Patient-derived skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) followed by differentiation into hepatocytes (hiPSC-Heps). Among five randomly selected hiPSC clones - differentiated into hiPSC-Heps - one clone expressed OTC protein, while the four remaining clones lacked OTC expression, supporting the patient's suspected diagnosis of OTCD.To conclude, we demonstrate that hiPSC technology is a powerful diagnostic tool to substantiate the suspected diagnosis of OTCD in patients lacking genetic confirmation. Furthermore, selecting clones that exclusively express the wild-type OTC protein, could be used strategically as cellular therapy in future. Ultimately, this approach might be applicable to virtually any X-linked disease. SYNOPSIS: Induced pluripotent stem cell technology is a powerful diagnostic tool to substantiate the suspected diagnosis of OTCD in patients lacking genetic confirmation."

      "abstract": "The brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), a major insect pest of rice, can make a shift in wing dimorphism to adapt to complex external environments. Our previous study showed that NlODC (Ornithine decarboxylase in N. lugens) was involved in wing dimorphism of the brown planthopper. Here, further experiments were conducted to reveal possible molecular mechanism of NlODC in manipulating the wing dimorphism. We found that the long-winged rate (LWR) of BPH was significantly reduced after RNAi of NlODC or injection of DFMO (D, L-α-Difluoromethylornithine), and LWR of males and females significantly decreased by 21.7% and 34.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, we also examined the contents of three polyamines under DFMO treatment and found that the contents of putrescine and spermidine were significantly lower compared to the control. After 3rd instar nymphs were injected with putrescine and spermidine, LWR was increased significantly in both cases, and putrescine was a little bit more effective, with 5.6% increase in males and 11.4% in females. Three days after injection of dsNlODC, injection of putrescine and spermidine rescued LWR to the normal levels. In the regulation of wing differentiation in BPH, NlODC mutually antagonistic to NlAkt may act through other signaling pathways rather than the classical insulin signaling pathway. This study illuminated a physiological function of an ODC gene involved in wing differentiation in insects, which could be a potential target for pest control.",

      "abstract": "Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is the most common genetic disorder of the urea cycle. These disorders are characterized by an inability to metabolize ammonia into urea, leading to hyperammonemia with variable physiological consequences and presenting important anesthetic challenges, especially the perioperative prevention of hyperammonemia and management of its consequences, should it occur. Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common spinal deformity requiring surgical treatment. This paper presents the case of a 16-year-old female with OTC deficiency who underwent spinal fusion for IS. The chosen anesthetic strategy was combined anesthesia with total intravenous general anesthesia using target-controlled infusion pumps, an erector spinae plane block (ESPB), and a multi-pronged approach to ensure metabolic control while avoiding hyperammonemia. The existing literature regarding major surgery in patients with OTC deficiency is sparse, and this paper provides one of the first case reports of a scoliosis correction surgery, as well as one of the first descriptions of prolonged propofol infusion and locoregional anesthesia with an erector spinae plane block in this context."

      "abstract": "The enzyme arginase 1 (A1) hydrolyzes the amino acid arginine to form L-ornithine and urea. Ornithine is further converted to polyamines by the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzyme. We previously reported that deletion of myeloid A1 in mice exacerbates retinal damage after ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. Furthermore, treatment with A1 protects against retinal IR injury in wild-type mice. PEG-A1 also mitigates the exaggerated inflammatory response of A1 knockout (KO) macrophages in vitro. Here, we sought to identify the anti-inflammatory pathway that confers macrophage A1-mediated protection against retinal IR injury. Acute elevation of intraocular pressure was used to induce retinal IR injury in mice. A multiplex cytokine assay revealed a marked increase in the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the retina at day 5 after IR injury. In vitro, blocking the A1/ODC pathway augmented IL-1β and TNF-α production in stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, A1 treatment attenuated the stimulated macrophage metabolic switch to a pro-inflammatory glycolytic phenotype, whereas A1 deletion had the opposite effect. Screening for histone deacetylases (HDACs) which play a role in macrophage inflammatory response showed that A1 deletion or ODC inhibition increased the expression of HDAC3. We further showed the involvement of HDAC3 in the upregulation of TNF-α but not IL-1β in stimulated macrophages deficient in the A1/ODC pathway. Investigating HDAC3 KO macrophages showed a reduced inflammatory response and a less glycolytic phenotype upon stimulation. In vivo, HDAC3 co-localized with microglia/macrophages at day 2 after IR in WT retinas and was further increased in A1-deficient retinas. Collectively, our data provide initial evidence that A1 exerts its anti-inflammatory effect in macrophages via ODC-mediated suppression of HDAC3 and IL-1β. Collectively we propose that interventions that augment the A1/ODC pathway and inhibit HDAC3 may confer therapeutic benefits for the treatment of retinal ischemic diseases.",

A literature review was also carried out by searching the PubMed database for studies on the GPB treatment for urea cycle disorders. RESULTS: With the GPB treatment, the blood ammonia and liver enzyme level in both patients have decreased to the normal range within 3 months. Motor development in child 2 has improved. No adverse reaction was noted, except for transient palmar greasy smell and loss of appetite in child 1. Analysis of the literature showed that patients had lower ammonia exposure, lower annual incidence of hyperammonemic crisis, more actual protein intake and fewer adverse events during GPB treatment. CONCLUSION: GPB is safe and effective for the treatment of OTCD.",

Defects in the OTC gene cause an impairment in ureagenesis, resulting in hyperammonemia, which is a direct cause of brain damage and death. Patients with late-onset OTCD can develop symptoms from infancy to later childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Clinical manifestations of adults with OTCD vary in acuity. Clinical symptoms can be aggravated by metabolic stressors or the presence of a catabolic state, or due to increased demands upon the urea. A prompt diagnosis and relevant biochemical and genetic investigations allow the rapid introduction of the right treatment and prevent long-term complications and mortality. This narrative review outlines challenges in diagnosing and managing patients with late-onset OTCD."

To date, liver transplantation is the only curative choice but is not widely available due to donor shortage, the need for life-long immunosuppression and technical challenges. A field of research that has shown a great deal of promise recently is gene therapy, and OTCD has been an essential candidate for different gene therapy modalities, including AAV gene addition, mRNA therapy and genome editing. This review will first summarise the main steps towards clinical translation, highlighting the benefits and challenges of each gene therapy approach, then focus on current clinical trials and finally outline future directions for the development of gene therapy for OTCD."

OTC deficiency (OTCD) is the most prevalent urea cycle disorder. Here, we show that intravenously delivered human OTC (hOTC) mRNA by lipid nanoparticles (LNP) was an effective treatment for OTCD by restoring the urea cycle. We observed a homotrimer conformation of hOTC proteins produced by the mRNA-LNP in cells by cryo-electron microscopy. The immunohistochemistry revealed the mitochondria localization of produced hOTC proteins in hepatocytes in mice. In livers of mice intravenously injected with hOTC-mRNA/LNP at 1.0 mg/kg, the delivered hOTC mRNA levels steeply decreased with a half-life (t1/2) of 7.1 h, whereas the produced hOTC protein levels retained for 5 days and then declined with a t1/2 of 2.2 days. In OTCD model mice (high-protein diet-fed Otcspf-ash hemizygous males), a single dose of hOTC-mRNA/LNP at 3.0 mg/kg ameliorated hyperammonemia and weight loss with prolonged survival rate (22 days) compared with that of untreated mice (11 days). Weekly repeated doses at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg were well tolerated in wild-type mice and showed a dose-dependent amelioration of survival rate in OTCD mice, thus, showing the therapeutic potential of LNP-formulated hOTC mRNA for OTCD."

      "abstract": "l-Ornithine (Orn) is a core amino acid responsible for ammonia detoxification in the body via the hepatic urea cycle. Clinical studies in Orn therapy have focused on interventions for hyperammonemia-associated diseases, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a life-threatening neurological symptom affecting more than 80% of patients with liver cirrhosis. However, its low molecular weight (LMW) causes Orn to diffuse nonspecifically and be rapidly eliminated from the body after oral administration, resulting in unfavorable therapeutic efficacy. Hence, Orn is constantly supplied by intravenous infusion in many clinical settings; however, this treatment inevitably decreases patient compliance and limits its application in long-term management. To improve the performance of Orn, we designed self-assembling polyOrn-based nanoparticles for oral administration through ring-opening polymerization of Orn-N-carboxy anhydride initiated with amino-ended poly(ethylene glycol), followed by acylation of free amino groups in the main chain of the polyOrn segment. The obtained amphiphilic block copolymers, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-polyOrn(acyl) (PEG-block-POrn(acyl)), enabled the formation of stable nanoparticles (NanoOrn(acyl)) in aqueous media. We employed the isobutyryl (iBu) group for acyl derivatization in this study (NanoOrn(iBu)). In the healthy mice, daily oral administration of NanoOrn(iBu) for one week did not induce any abnormalities. In the mice exhibiting acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury, oral pretreatment with NanoOrn(iBu) effectively reduced systemic ammonia and transaminases levels compared to the LMW Orn and untreated groups. The results suggest that the application of NanoOrn(iBu) is of significant clinical value with the feasibility of oral delivery and improvement in APAP-induced hepatic pathogenesis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Liver injury is often accompanied by hyperammonemia, a life-threatening condition characterized by elevated blood ammonia levels. Current clinical treatments for reducing ammonia typically entail the invasive approach of intravenous infusion, involving the administration of l-ornithine (Orn) or a combination of Orn and L-aspartate. This method is employed due to the poor pharmacokinetics associated with these compounds. In our pursuit of enhancing therapy, we have developed an orally administrable nanomedicine based on Orn-based self-assembling nanoparticle (NanoOrn(iBu)), which provides sustained Orn supply to the injured liver. Oral administration of NanoOrn(iBu) to healthy mice did not cause any toxic effects. In a mouse model of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury, oral administration of NanoOrn(iBu) surpassed Orn in reducing systemic ammonia levels and liver damage, thereby establishing NanoOrn(iBu) as a safe and effective therapeutic option.",

The clinical manifestation of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is hyperammonemia that causes irreversible neurological damage. Liver transplantation is a curative therapy for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. The aim of this study is to suggest, from our previous experience, an anesthesia management protocol of liver transplantation for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, particularly focused on liver transplantation for cases with uncontrolled hyperammonemia. METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed our anesthesia-related experience in all cases of liver transplantation for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency in our center. RESULTS: Twenty-nine liver transplantation cases for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency were found between November 2005 and March 2021 in our center. Of these, 25 cases were stable through the perioperative period. However, 2 cases with carrier donor graft had hyperammonemia after liver transplantation. Another two cases had uncontrolled hyperammonemia before liver transplantation, even with continuous hemodialysis. They underwent life-saving liver transplantation. Their metabolic status stabilized after the anhepatic phase. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation for cases with uncontrolled hyperammonemia can be performed with proper management. Second, liver transplantation with carrier donors should be avoided because of the risk of postoperative recurrence.",

Their photoinactivation efficacies against MRPM in vitro were reported and include the influence of laser energy, uptake, MIC and MBC, dose-dependent photoinactivation effects, membrane integrity, and fluorescence imaging. The PACT in vivo was evaluated using a wound mouse model infected by MRPM. Photosensitizer 4d displayed high photo inactivation efficacy against MRPM at 7.81 μM under illumination, and it could accelerate wound healing via bactericidal effect. These ornithine-porphyrin conjugates are potential photosensitizers for PACT in the treatment of MRPM infection."

The treatment for VL is limited and has many adverse effects. The development of safer and more efficacious drugs is urgently needed. Drug repurposing is one of the best processes to repurpose existing drugs. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is an important target against L. donovani in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway. In this study, we have modeled the 3D structure of ODC and performed high-throughput virtual screening of 8630 ZINC database ligands against Leishmania donovani ornithine decarboxylase (Ld ODC), selecting 45 ligands based on their high binding score. It is further validated through molecular docking simulation and the selection of the top two lead molecules (ceftaroline fosamil and rimegepant) for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, Density functional theory (DFT), and molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MMGBSA) analysis. The results showed that the binding affinities of ceftaroline fosamil, and rimegepant are, respectively, -10.719 and 10.159 kcal/mol. The docking complexes of the two lead compounds, ceftaroline fosamil, and rimegepant, with the target ODC, were found stable during molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, the analysis of MMGBSA revealed that these compounds had a high binding free energy.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cold tolerance remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that ornithine δ-aminotransferase (OsOAT) contributes to cold tolerance during the vegetative and reproductive development of rice. osoat mutant was identified as a temperature-sensitive male sterile mutant with deformed floral organs and seedlings sensitive to cold stress. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that OsOAT mutation and cold treatment of the wild-type plant led to similar changes in the global gene expression profiles in anthers. OsOAT genes in indica rice Huanghuazhan (HHZ) and japonica rice Wuyungeng (WYG) are different in gene structure and response to cold. OsOAT is cold-inducible in WYG but cold-irresponsive in HHZ. Further studies showed that indica varieties carry both WYG-type and HHZ-type OsOAT, whereas japonica varieties mostly carry WYG-type OsOAT. Cultivars carrying HHZ-type OsOAT are mainly distributed in low-latitude regions, whereas varieties carrying WYG-type OsOAT are distributed in both low- and high-latitude regions. Moreover, indica varieties carrying WYG-type OsOAT generally have higher seed-setting rates than those carrying HHZ-type OsOAT under cold stress at reproductive stage, highlighting the favorable selection for WYG-type OsOAT during domestication and breeding to cope with low temperatures.",

Psychiatric symptoms of hyperammonemia are nonspecific and can cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like symptoms and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms. Some studies report that OTC deficiency is often initially diagnosed as ASD or ADHD. However, there are no reports of OTC deficiency comorbid with ASD and ADHD. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient is 17-year-old girl diagnosed with OTC deficiency at 3 years of age. She had behavioral problems since childhood, including depressed mood, irritability, and impulsive behavior; however, they were considered OTC-mediated nonspecific psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, the patient had not been appropriately assessed for ASD and ADHD. She presented with depressed mood and self-harm at 17 years of age. DIAGNOSES: We diagnosed her with ASD and ADHD based on her medical history and semistructured interviews. INTERVENTIONS: We focused her ASD and ADHD traits and discussed strategies with her for better adaptive living. OUTCOMES: Our interventions resulted in her better social adjustment. LESSONS: Physicians should consider the possibility of comorbid ASD and ADHD in individuals with OTC, facilitating appropriate and intervention for better outcomes.",

For cancer cells, ornithine is mainly used as a substrate for ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) for the synthesis of polyamines. The ODC as a key enzyme of polyamine metabolism has become an important target for cancer diagnosis and treatment. To non-invasively detect the levels of ODC expression in malignant tumors, we have synthesized a novel 68Ga-labeled ornithine derivative ([68Ga]Ga-NOTA-Orn). The synthesis time of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-Orn was about 30 min with a radiochemical yield of 45-50% (uncorrected), and the radiochemical purity was > 98%. [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-Orn was stable in saline and rat serum. Cellular uptake and competitive inhibition assays using DU145 and AR42J cells demonstrated that the transport pathway of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-Orn was similar to that of L-ornithine, and it could interact with the ODC after transporting into the cell. Biodistribution and micro-positron emission tomography (Micro-PET) imaging studies showed that [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-Orn exhibited rapid tumor uptake and was rapidly excreted through the urinary system. All above results suggested that [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-Orn is a novel amino acid metabolic imaging agent with great potential of tumor diagnosis.",

Affected patients have increased ornithine concentrations in blood and other body fluids and develop progressive constriction of vision fields leading to blindness. Current therapies are unsatisfactory and better treatments are highly needed. In two mouse models of OAT deficiency that recapitulates biochemical and retinal changes of GACR, we investigated the efficacy of an intravenously injected serotype 8 adeno-associated (AAV8) vector expressing OAT under the control of a hepatocyte-specific promoter. Following injections, OAT-deficient mice showed reductions of ornithine concentrations in blood and eye cups compared with control mice injected with a vector expressing green fluorescent protein. AAV-injected mice showed improved electroretinogram response and partial restoration of retinal structure up to one-year post-injection. In summary, hepatic OAT expression by AAV8 vector was effective at correction of hyperornithinemia and improved function and structure of the retina. In conclusion, this study provides proof-of-concept of efficacy of liver-directed AAV-mediated gene therapy of GACR.",

Our primary patient is a female monozygotic twin who presented to medical care at 10 months of age with acute liver failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia. The patient's older brother, known to have hemizygous OTC deficiency, died at 8 months of age from cardiac arrest after complications secondary to his diagnosis. Despite her family history, manifestation of symptoms of heterozygous (partial) OTC deficiency went unrecognized by multiple providers based on misconceptions regarding a female's risk for X-linked disease. Despite barriers related to the family's low socioeconomic status, follow-up care by a multidisciplinary metabolic care team, including moderate protein restriction and nitrogen scavenger therapy, led to positive outcomes for the patient. Her twin sister and mother are also heterozygous for variants in OTC and remain controlled on moderate protein restriction. This case illustrates the importance of genotyping all individuals with genetic risk factors for OTC deficiency and the variability in disease manifestation that necessitates tailored treatment approaches for individuals with partial OTC deficiency."

While the patient was hospitalized for liver biopsy, intermittent tremors of the upper extremities with varying severity were noted. The patient was presumed to have hyperammonemia secondary to acute liver failure and was discharged after 5 days; follow-up monitoring led to readmission 7 days later. A brain MRI showed nonspecific bilateral pericallosal and bifrontal white matter FLAIR hyperintensities. These findings raised suspicion for a metabolic disease and prompted a genetics consultation. After inconclusive biochemical testing and worsening clinical status, rapid whole genome sequencing results were obtained identifying a novel, de novo, likely pathogenic, variant c.608C > T (p.Ser203Phe) in the OTC gene. The patient was promptly started on an oral nitrogen scavenger, citrulline supplementation, and protein restriction. Ammonia and glutamine levels normalized within 1 month of treatment and have stayed within the goal ranges with continued tailoring of treatment. Her parents noted resolution of vomiting and improved mood stability. Liver enzymes normalized after 2 months of treatment. The tremor, identified as asterixis, improved and a repeat brain MRI 3 months after the initial imaging showed near-complete resolution of previous white matter hyperintensities."

Our patient was diagnosed during childhood after hyperammonemia associated with surgery and steroid treatment and was well-controlled with nitrogen scavenger treatment, low-protein diet, and L-citrulline supplementation. OTC gene sequencing identified a variant of unknown significance that has more recently been classified as likely pathogenic. Women with OTC deficiency are at increased risk of hyperammonemia during pregnancy and the postpartum period, therefore monthly follow up and laboratory assessments are critical in management decision making. Our patient was maintained on glycerol phenylbutyrate, L-citrulline and essential amino acid supplements, along with restricted protein intake during pregnancy. A multidisciplinary approach with the obstetrics, prenatal genetics, high risk obstetric, and anesthesia teams was also necessary for optimal management during pregnancy, throughout labor and delivery, and during the postpartum period. After successful childbirth and discharge, our patient experienced a hyperammonemic crisis related to poor enteral nutrition, and acute management protocols were implemented to stabilize her. For her newborn son, acute hyperammonemia protocols were on standby, and newborn screening and laboratory testing were expedited to assess his risk. He was healthy and did not experience symptoms of concern. In this case report, we emphasize the importance of close collaboration with maternal-fetal medicine team members during and immediately after pregnancy to ensure successful management of a female patient with OTC deficiency and her newborn."

Her symptoms improved after treatment with a modified protein-restricted diet, long-term nitrogen-scavenger therapy, and supplemental L-citrulline. Adherence to her UCD management regimen remained a challenge due to her underlying frailty and other medical conditions, which included primary renal impairment (further exasperated by type 2 diabetes mellitus) and decreased left-ventricular function.

Thus, we investigated the effects of ornithine aspartate (LOLA) and/or Vitamin E (VitE) on CV parameters in a steatohepatitis experimental model. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned (10 animals each) and treated from 16 to 28 weeks with gavage as follows: controls (standard diet plus distilled water (DW)), NAFLD (high-fat choline-deficient diet (HFCD) plus DW), NAFLD+LOLA (HFCD plus LOLA (200 mg/kg/day)), NAFLD+VitE (HFCD plus VitE (150 mg twice a week)) or NAFLD+LOLA+VitE in the same doses. Atherogenic ratios were higher in NAFLD when compared with NAFLD+LOLA+VitE and controls (p < 0.05). Serum concentration of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, e-selectin, ICAM-1, and PAI-1 were not different in intervention groups and controls (p > 0.05). NAFLD+LOLA decreased miR-122, miR-33a, and miR-186 (p < 0.05, for all) in relation to NAFLD. NAFLD+LOLA+VitE decreased miR-122, miR-33a and miR-186, and increased miR-126 (p < 0.05, for all) in comparison to NAFLD and NAFLD+VitE. NAFLD+LOLA and NAFLD+LOLA+VitE prevented liver collagen deposition (p = 0.006) in comparison to NAFLD. Normal cardiac fibers (size and shape) were lower in NAFLD in relation to the others; and the inverse was reported for the percentage of regular hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. NAFLD+LOLA+VitE promoted a significant improvement in atherogenic dyslipidemia, liver fibrosis, and paracrine signaling of lipid metabolism and endothelial dysfunction.

Progression toward non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with alterations of skeletal muscle.

In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that NASH-associated hyperammonemia drives muscle changes as well as liver disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Alms1-mutant mice (foz/foz) fed a 60% fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks; we investigated hepatic and muscular ammonia detoxification efficiency. We then tested the effect of an 8 week-long supplementation with L-ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA), a known ammonia-lowering treatment, given after either 4 or 12 weeks of HFD for a preventive or a curative intervention, respectively. We monitored body composition, liver and muscle state by micro computed tomography (micro-CT) as well as muscle strength by four-limb grip test. RESULTS: According to previous studies, 12 weeks of HFD induced NASH in all foz/foz mice. Increase of hepatic ammonia production and alterations of urea cycle efficiency were observed, leading to hyperammonemia. Concomitantly mice developed marked myosteatosis. First signs of myopenia occurred after 20 weeks of diet. Early LOLA treatment given during NASH development, but not its administration in a curative regimen, efficiently prevented myosteatosis and muscle quality, but barely impacted liver disease or, surprisingly, ammonia detoxification. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the perturbation of hepatic ammonia detoxification pathways in NASH. Results from the interventional experiments suggest a direct beneficial impact of LOLA on skeletal muscle during NASH development, though it does not improve ammonia metabolism or liver disease."

We report a case of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) secondary to the treatment of hyperammonaemia due to OTCD, a disease requiring early diagnosis, as it can have a severe prognosis. CASE: A girl toddler was brought to the hospital with a complaint of somnolence, presenting with hyperammonaemia and liver failure, and was diagnosed with OTCD. Treatment was started immediately, and the ammonia level returned to the normal range within 24 hours. On days 13-20, another treatment was commenced for re-elevated ammonia levels, which subsequently returned to within the reference range; however, mildly impaired consciousness persisted. Hypokalaemia coincided with temporary intravenous treatment and continuous haemodialysis. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images revealed lesions as high-signal areas in the bilateral putamen on day 11 (extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM)) and in the pons on day 51 (central pontine myelinolysis (CPM)). Consequently, ODS was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: When interpreting magnetic resonance images of patients under acute treatment for hyperammonaemia due to OTCD, a condition that may be complicated by hypokalaemia, paying attention to findings suggesting EPM may help detect ODS before CPM appears and may improve patient prognosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked semi-dominant disorder, causing possible fatal hyperammonemia. Late-onset OTCD can develop at any time from 2 months after birth to adulthood, accounting for 70% of all OTCDs. CASE REPORT A 35-year-old man with chronic headaches stated that since childhood he felt sick after eating meat. Fourteen days before hospital admission, he began receiving 60 mg/day of intravenous prednisolone for sudden deafness. The prednisolone was stopped 5 days before hospital admission. Four days later, he was transferred to our hospital because of confusion. On admission, he had hyperammonemia of 393 µmol/L. Because he became comatose 7 hours after admission, and his serum ammonia increased to 1071 µmol/L, we promptly started hemodialysis. Because his family history included 2 deceased infant boys, we suspected late-onset OTCD. On day 2 of hospitalization, we began administering ammonia-scavenging medications. Because he gradually regained consciousness, we stopped his hemodialysis on day 6. After his general condition improved, he was transferred to the previous hospital for rehabilitation on day 32. We definitively diagnosed him with late-onset OTCD due to the low plasma citrulline and high urinary orotic acid levels found during his hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should suspect urea cycle disorders, such as OTCD, when adult patients present with marked hyperammonemia without liver cirrhosis. Adult patients with marked hyperammonemia should immediately undergo hemodialysis to remove ammonia, regardless of causative diseases.",

Several male patients with OTCD suffer from severe hyperammonemic crisis in the neonatal period, whereas others develop late-onset manifestations, including hyperammonemic coma. Females with heterozygous pathogenic variants in the OTC gene may develop a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic conditions to severe hyperammonemic attacks, owing to skewed lyonization. We reported the variants of CPS1, ASS, ASL and OTC detected in the patients with urea cycle disorders through a nation-wide survey in Japan. In this study, we updated the variant data of OTC in Japanese patients and acquired information regarding genetic variants of OTC from patients with OTCD through an extensive literature review. The 523 variants included 386 substitution (330 missense, 53 nonsense, and 3 silent), eight deletion, two duplication, one deletion-insertion, 55 frame shift, two extension, and 69 no category (1 regulatory and 68 splice site error) mutations. We observed a genotype-phenotype relation between the onset time (neonatal onset or late onset), the severity, and genetic mutation in male OTCD patients because the level of deactivation of OTC significantly depends on the pathogenic OTC variants. In conclusion, genetic information about OTC may help to predict long-term outcomes and determine specific treatment strategies, such as liver transplantation, in patients with OTCD."

      "abstract": "Protein catabolism ultimately yields toxic ammonia, which must be converted to urea by the liver for renal excretion. In extrahepatic tissues, ammonia is temporarily converted primarily to glutamine for subsequent hepatic extraction. Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are inborn errors of metabolism causing impaired ureagenesis, leading to neurotoxic accumulation of ammonia and brain glutamine. Treatment includes dietary protein restriction and oral \"ammonia scavengers.\" These scavengers chemically combine with glutamine and glycine to yield excretable products, creating an alternate pathway of waste nitrogen disposal. The amino acid transporter SLC6A19 is responsible for >95% of absorption and reabsorption of free neutral amino acids in the small intestine and kidney, respectively. Genetic SLC6A19 deficiency causes massive neutral aminoaciduria but is typically benign. We hypothesized that inhibiting SLC6A19 would open a novel and effective alternate pathway of waste nitrogen disposal. To test this, we crossed SLC6A19 knockout (KO) mice with spfash mice, a model of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. Loss of SLC6A19 in spfash mice normalized plasma ammonia and brain glutamine and increased median survival in response to a high protein diet from 7 to 97 days. While induced excretion of amino acid nitrogen is likely the primary therapeutic mechanism, reduced intestinal absorption of dietary free amino acids, and decreased muscle protein turnover due to loss of SLC6A19 may also play a role. In summary, the results suggest that SLC6A19 inhibition represents a promising approach to treating UCDs and related aminoacidopathies.",

Due to high phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from lethal neonatal hyperammonemic events to moderate symptoms and even asymptomatic individuals, the prediction of the disease course at an early disease stage is very important to individually adjust therapies such as medical treatment or liver transplantation. In this translational study, we developed a severity-adjusted classification system based on in vitro residual enzymatic OTC activity. METHODS: Applying a cell-based expression system, residual enzymatic OTC activities of 71 pathogenic OTC variants were spectrophotometrically determined and subsequently correlated with clinical and biochemical outcome parameters of 119 male individuals with OTC-D (mOTC-D) as reported in the UCDC and E-IMD registries. RESULTS: Integration of multiple data sources enabled the establishment of a robust disease prediction model for mOTC-D. Residual enzymatic OTC activity not only correlates with age at first symptoms, initial peak plasma ammonium concentration and frequency of metabolic decompensations but also predicts mortality. The critical threshold of 4.3% residual enzymatic activity distinguishes a severe from an attenuated phenotype. INTERPRETATION: Residual enzymatic OTC activity reliably predicts the disease severity in mOTC-D and could thus serve as a tool for severity-adjusted evaluation of therapeutic strategies and counselling patients and parents.",

      "abstract": "The extracellular matrix surrounding oligodendrocytes plays an important role during myelination and remyelination in the brain. In many cases, the microenvironment surrounding demyelination lesions contains inhibitory molecules, which lead to repair failure. Accordingly, blocking the activity of these inhibitory factors in the extracellular matrix should lead to more successful remyelination. In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheath. We performed primary cell culture and found that a natural increase in fibronectin promoted the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitors during the initial stage of remyelination while inhibiting oligodendrocyte differentiation. Poly-L-ornithine blocked these inhibitory effects without compromising fibronectin's pro-proliferation function. Experiments showed that poly-L-ornithine activated the Erk1/2 signaling pathway that is necessary in the early stages of differentiation, as well as PI3K signaling pathways that are needed in the mid-late stages. When poly-L-ornithine was tested in a lysolecithin-induced animal model of focal demyelination, it enhanced myelin regeneration and promoted motor function recovery. These findings suggest that poly-L-ornithine has the potential to be a treatment option for clinical myelin sheath injury."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is a genetic metabolic disease. Its clinical manifestations are mainly central nervous system dysfunction caused by high blood ammonia. Late-onset OTCD combined with central nervous system injury has a poor therapeutic response, which is one of the main factors affecting the prognosis and quality of life of patients. liver transplantation (LT) has gradually become a radical treatment for OTCD, which has achieved good results. However, there is no consensus on the timing of LT and problems of nervous system damage and repair. METHODS: We report the development of late-onset OTCD with central nervous system injury in an 11-year-old child who received liver transplantation at our transplant center. His first symptoms were nonprojectile vomiting, followed by irritability and disturbance of consciousness, after which the disease progressed rapidly and finally resulted in a coma. After liver transplantation, the child's consciousness returned to normal, muscle strength of the limbs gradually recovered from grade 0 to grade 4, and muscle tone gradually recovered from grade 4 to grade 1, suggesting that the motor nerves had gradually recovered. However, the child is currently mentally retarded, and the language center has not yet fully recovered.At the same time, we made a literature review of OTCD. CONCLUSION: For OTCD patients with central nervous system injury, liver transplantation can fundamentally solve the problem of ammonia metabolism in the liver and avoids further damage to the central nervous system caused by hyperammonemia. At the same time, children's nervous systems are in the developmental stage when neuroplasticity is greatest. If liver transplantation is performed as soon as possible, nerve repair is still possible.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked inherited disorder and characterized by marked elevation of blood ammonia. The goal of treatment is to minimize the neurological damage caused by hyperammonemia. OTCD can be cured by liver transplantation (LT). Post-transplant patients can discontinue anti- hyperammonemia agents and consume a regular diet without the risk of developing hyperammonemia. The neurological damage caused by hyperammonemia is almost irreversible. CASE SUMMARY: An 11.7-year-old boy presented with headache, vomiting, and altered consciousness. The patient was diagnosed with late-onset OTCD. After nitrogen scavenging treatment and a protein-free diet, ammonia levels were reduced to normal on the third day of admission. Nevertheless, the patient remained in a moderate coma. After discussion, LT was performed. Following LT, the patient's blood ammonia and biochemical indicators stabilized in the normal range, he regained consciousness, and his nervous system function significantly recovered. Two months after LT, blood amino acids and urine organic acids were normal, and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a decrease in subcortical lesions. CONCLUSION: LT can significantly improve partial neurological impairment caused by late-onset OTCD hyperammonemic encephalopathy, and LT can be actively considered when early drug therapy is ineffective."

      "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause acute and severe infections. Increasing resistance to antibiotics has given rise to the urgent need for an alternative antimicrobial agent. A promising strategy is the inhibition of iron sequestration in the bacteria. The current work aimed to screen for inhibitors of pyoverdine-mediated iron sequestration in P. aeruginosa. As a drug target, we choose l-ornithine-N5-monooxygenase (PvdA), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine that catalyzes the FAD-dependent hydroxylation of the side chain amine of ornithine. As drug repurposing is a fast and cost-efficient way of discovering new applications for known drugs, the approach may help to solve emerging clinical problems. In this study, we use data about molecules from drug banks for screening. A total of 15 drugs that are similar in structure to l-ornithine, the substrate of PvdA, and 30 drugs that are sub-structures of l-ornithine were virtually docked against PvdA. N-2-succinyl ornithine and cilazapril were found to be the top binders with a binding energy of -12.8 and -9.1 kcal mol-1, respectively. As the drug-likeness and ADME properties of the drugs were also found to be promising, molecular dynamics studies were performed to further confirm the stability of the complexes. The results of this in silico study indicate that N-2-succinyl ornithine could potentially be explored as a drug for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GACR) secondary to deficiency of ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder usually diagnosed in childhood when patients develop myopia and a characteristic retinal degeneration accompanied by hyperornithinemia. Plasma ammonia is normal or sub-normal after the neonatal period. A few GACR patients present in early infancy with hyperammonemia, encephalopathy and a biochemical profile of low plasma ornithine, citrulline and arginine, with increased urinary excretion of homocitrulline and orotic acid, resembling a primary urea cycle disorder. In these patients, ornithine levels do not increase until late infancy or following arginine or citrulline supplementation. We describe a patient with OAT deficiency who presented in the first month of life with episodes of lethargy, vomiting, and hypothermia. He had two episodes of hyperammonemia associated with subnormal levels of plasma ornithine, citrulline and arginine as well as elevated urinary excretion of homocitrulline and orotic acid. Unlike previously reported cases, intermittent hyperornithinemia was observed prior to the first hyperammonemic episode and citrulline supplementation. The latter alleviated the symptoms, normalized ammonia level, and led to increased plasma ornithine concentration. Furthermore, despite a protein restricted diet and ammonia scavenger treatment, continued supplemental citrulline was necessary to prevent hyperammonemia. Molecular analysis confirmed OAT deficiency, differentiating it from proximal urea cycle disorders and deficiency of the mitochondrial ornithine transporter, ORC1, (Hyperammonemia-Hyperornithinemia-Homocitrullinuria syndrome).

      "abstract": "Hyperornithinemia with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (HOGA) is a severe recessive inherited disease, causing muscular degeneration and retinochoroidal atrophy that progresses to blindness. HOGA arises from mutations in the ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) gene, and nearly one-third of the known patients worldwide are homozygous for the Finnish founder mutation OAT c.1205 T > C p.(Leu402Pro). We have corrected this loss-of-function OAT mutation in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using CRISPR/Cas9. The correction restored OAT expression in stem cells and normalized the elevated ornithine levels in cell lysates and cell media. These results show an efficient recovery of OAT function in iPSC, encouraging the possibility of autologous cell therapy for the HOGA disease."

      "abstract": "Rice, as one of the most aluminium (Al)-resistant cereal crops, has developed more complicated Al resistance mechanisms than others. By using forward genetic screening from a rice ethyl methanesulfonate mutant library, we obtained a mutant showing specifically high sensitivity to Al. Through MutMap analysis followed by a complementation test, we identified the causal gene, Al-related Protein Kinase (ArPK) for Al-sensitivity. ArPK expression was induced by a relatively longer exposure to high Al concentration in the roots. The result of RNA-sequencing indicated the functional disorder in arginine metabolism pathway with downregulation of N-acetylornithine deacetylase (NAOD) expression and upregulation of Ornithine decarboxylase1 (ODC1) expression in arpk mutant. Al specifically and rapidly upregulated ODC1 expression and causes overaccumulation of putrescine (Put), whereas the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine reverted Al-sensitive phenotype of arpk, suggesting that overaccumulation of endogenous Put might be harmful for root growth, and that ArPK seems to act as an endogenous inhibitor of ODC1 action to maintain suitable endogenous Put level under Al treatment. Overall, we identified ArPK and its putative repressive role in controlling a novel ODC-dependent Put biosynthesis pathway specifically affecting rice Al resistance, thus enriching the fundamental understanding of plant Al resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), which is predominantly found in infants, is a clonal abnormality of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and presents with the symptoms of both myeloproliferative tumors and myelodysplastic syndromes. Estimates have shown that ~20 cases of JMML occur annually in Japan. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), the most common among all urea cycle disorders (UCDs), occurs in 1 of 80,000 people in Japan. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-month-old infant who had fever, vomiting, and diarrhea for 2 days was referred to our hospital for the following abnormalities in blood tests: white blood cell count, 48,200/μL; hemoglobin, 9.0 g/dL; and platelet count, 135,000/μL. Bone marrow examination showed a nucleated cell count of 396,000/mm3 and blast cell count of 5.0%, as well as decreased mature granulocyte count and slightly myeloperoxidase stain-negative blasts but no monoclonal cell proliferation on May-Giemsa staining. Colony assay showed the proliferation of spontaneous colony and high sensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Genetic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that the patient was positive for neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) mutation. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with JMML. Approximately 170 days after his first hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the patient's JMML relapsed. Shortly after the recurrence, nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation, and decreased vitality were observed, followed by a decrease in the level of consciousness. The patient's ammonia level was 472 μmol/L. A test for seven different genetic mutations for the UCD showed the presence of c. 119G>A (amino acid change p. Arg40His). As such, late-onset OTCD was added to his diagnosis. Administration of sodium phenylacetate, l-arginine hydrochloride, and carnitine was continued following the diagnosis of OTCD, after which hyperammonemia was not observed. Regarding JMML relapse, HSCT was performed on day 405 after the first transplantation. CONCLUSION: Hyperammonemia should be considered a differential diagnosis when unexplained and non-specific symptoms occur during the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Patients should be tested for UCD as a cause of hyperammonemia, and treatment for hyperammonemia should be continued until the cause is identified. The patient shows normal developmental progress, has an intact neurological status, and has not experienced another hyperammonemia attack. His JMML has remained in remission for over 3 years."

      "abstract": "Carvacrol, a monoterpene known for its pharmacological activities, is present in the essential oil of Origanum majorana, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris, and Lippia graveolens. It is used in food as a flavoring and preservative agent in cosmetics and medicines because of its useful bioactivities in clinical practice. However, carvacrol was not much explored for its anticancer potential. Targeting enzymes involved in carcinogenesis, such as ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5), and hyaluronidase (HYAL) by monoterpenes are amongst the efficient approaches for cancer prevention and treatment. In this study, the efficacy of carvacrol was investigated against deregulated cancer biomarkers/targets in organ-specific human cancer cell lines (FaDu, K562, and A549) utilizing in vitro, in silico, and in vivo approaches. The efficacy of carvacrol was evaluated on human cancer cell lines using neutral red uptake (NRU), sulpho rhodamine B (SRB), and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. The mechanistic study was carried out in cell-based test systems. Further, the potency of carvacrol was confirmed by the quantitative real-time PCR analysis and molecular docking studies. The in vivo anti-tumor potential of carvacrol was performed on mice S-180 model, and the toxicity examination was accomplished through in silico approach. Carvacrol significantly impeded the growth of FaDu, K562, and A549 cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 9.61 ± 0.05 to 81.32 ± 11.83 μM. Further, the efficacy of carvacrol was explored against different cancer targets in FaDu, K562, and A549 cell lines. Carvacrol inhibits the ODC, COX-2, LOX-5, and HYAL activities in FaDu cell line and ODC, COX-2, and HYAL activities in K562 cell line. The results were validated by expression analysis revealing the downregulation of the targeted gene with a significant change in the transcript level of ODC and HYAL in FaDu cell line with a fold change of 1.56 and 1.61, respectively. A non-significant effect of carvacrol was observed on the downstream signaling pathway of PI3K and HIF-1α/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in FaDu cells. The cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) experiments demonstrate that carvacrol induces apoptosis of FaDu cells. Further, the potency of carvacrol was also evaluated in vivo on mice S-180 tumor model, wherein it inhibits tumor growth (72%) at 75 mg/kg body weight (bw). ADMET studies predicted carvacrol as a safe molecule. Overall, carvacrol delayed the growth of FaDu, K562, and A549 cell lines by targeting enzymes involved in the carcinogenesis process. The existence of one hydroxyl group at the para position of carvacrol could be responsible for the anti-proliferative activity. Thus, carvacrol could be used as a pharmacophore to develop a safe and effective multi-targeted anti-cancer medicament."

In plants, this reaction biochemically connects urea cycle, proline cycle, and polyamine biosynthesis pathway. OAT activity is shown to be associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses and nitrogen metabolism, but its physiological role is still unclear. In our study, we decided to investigate transcriptional regulation of the OAT gene in Arabidopsis thaliana under normal conditions and in response to various growth regulators. In the present work, the reporter gene construct containing the Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase gene (gus) under control of the A. thaliana OAT gene promoter was introduced into the genome of A. thaliana ecotype Columbia plants using the floral dip method; GUS activity was assayed in different experimental conditions including hormone treatment, low and high nitrogen and salinity. The GUS activity was analyzed histochemically. Plants were incubated with staining solution containing X-Gluc. We show that under standard growth conditions, the promoter is active during germination and in developing floral organs. OAT promoter activity specifically activates in response to different forms of auxin (IAA, NAA, and 2,4D), cytokinin (6- BAP), ethylene precursor (ACC), high nitrogen and salinity. Analysis of the OAT expression by qRT-PCR confirmed the pattern observed using the GUS reporter system. The OAT gene showed a significantly elevated expression in fourday- old seedlings and in plant roots in response to auxins and cytokinins. The analysis of the OAT promoter structure reveals cis-acting regulatory DNA elements associated with auxin regulation and abiotic stresses. The results of the study indicate that the OAT gene is involved in developmental processes and is regulated by auxin and cytokinins."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is most common among urea cycle disorders (UCDs), defined by defects in enzymes associated with ureagenesis. Corticosteroid administration to UCD patients, including OTCD patients, is suggested to be avoided, as it may induce life-threatening hyperammonemia. The mechanism has been considered nitrogen overload due to the catabolic effect of corticosteroids; however, the pathophysiological process is unclear. METHODS: To elucidate the mechanism of hyperammonemia induced by corticosteroid administration in OTCD patients, we analyzed a mouse model by administering corticosteroids to OTCspf-ash mice deficient in the OTC gene. Dexamethasone (DEX; 20 mg/kg) was administered to the OTCspf-ash and wild-type (WT) mice at 0 and 24 h, and the serum ammonia concentrations, the levels of the hepatic metabolites, and the gene expressions related with ammonia metabolism in the livers and muscles were analyzed. RESULTS: The ammonia levels in Otcspf-ash mice that were administered DEX tended to increase at 24 h and increased significantly at 48 h. The metabolomic analysis showed that the levels of citrulline, arginine, and ornithine did not differ significantly between Otcspf-ash mice that were administered DEX and normal saline; however, the level of aspartate was increased drastically in Otcspf-ash mice owing to DEX administration (P < 0.01). Among the enzymes associated with the urea cycle, mRNA expressions of carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1, ornithine transcarbamylase, arginosuccinate synthase 1, and arginosuccinate lyase in the livers were significantly downregulated by DEX administration in both the Otcspf-ash and WT mice (P < 0.01). Among the enzymes associated with catabolism, mRNA expression of Muscle RING-finger protein-1 in the muscles was significantly upregulated in the muscles of WT mice by DEX administration (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We elucidated that corticosteroid administration induced hyperammonemia in Otcspf-ash mice by not only muscle catabolism but also suppressing urea-cycle-related gene expressions. Since the urea cycle intermediate amino acids, such as arginine, might not be effective because of the suppressed expression of urea-cycle-related genes by corticosteroid administration, we should consider an early intervention by renal replacement therapy in cases of UCD patients induced by corticosteroids to avoid brain injuries or fatal outcomes.",

Ornithine phenylacetate (OP), a potent ammonia scavenger, is being evaluated for the treatment of acute/overt HE. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of OP in patients with HE were characterized in this phase IIb study (NCT01966419). Adult patients hospitalized with an overt HE episode, cirrhosis, and plasma ammonia above the upper limit of normal (ULN) who failed to improve after 48 hours' standard care were randomly assigned to continuous intravenous OP (10, 15, or 20 g/day, based on Child-Turcotte-Pugh score) or matching placebo for 5 days. Plasma levels of ornithine and phenylacetic acid (PAA) and plasma/urinary levels of phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) (primary metabolite of PAA) were regularly assessed; plasma ammonia level was the primary pharmacodynamic variable. PAA demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetics; ornithine and PAGN levels increased with dose. PAGN urinary excretion represented ~50%-60% of administered PAA across all doses. Mean reduction in plasma ammonia with OP at 3 hours postinfusion was significantly greater versus placebo (p = 0.014); and time to achieve plasma ammonia less than or equal to the ULN was significantly reduced (p = 0.028). Achievement of clinical response based on HE stage was associated with a greater reduction in mean plasma ammonia level (p = 0.009). OP effects on plasma ammonia were consistent with its proposed mechanism of action as a primary ammonia scavenger, with a significant association between reduced plasma ammonia and improvement in HE stage. OP should be further evaluated as a promising treatment for hyperammonemia in patients with overt HE.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In severe acute pancreatitis (AP) the CNS is affected manifesting in neurological symptoms. Earlier research from our laboratory showed blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability elevation in a taurocholate-induced AP model. Here we aimed to further explore BBB changes in AP using a different, non-invasive in vivo model induced by L-ornithine. Our goal was also to identify whether L-ornithine, a cationic amino acid, has a direct effect on brain endothelial cells in vitro contributing to the observed BBB changes. METHODS: AP was induced in rats by the intraperitoneal administration of L-ornithine-HCl. Vessel permeability and the gene expression of the primary transporter of L-ornithine, cationic amino acid transporter-1 (Cat-1) in the brain cortex, pancreas, liver and lung were determined. Ultrastructural changes were followed by transmission electron microscopy. The direct effect of L-ornithine was tested on primary rat brain endothelial cells and a triple co-culture model of the BBB. Viability and barrier integrity, including permeability and TEER, nitrogen monoxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NF-κB translocation were measured. Fluorescent staining for claudin-5, occludin, ZO-1, β-catenin, cell adhesion molecules Icam-1 and Vcam-1 and mitochondria was performed. Cell surface charge was measured by laser Doppler velocimetry. RESULTS: In the L-ornithine-induced AP model vessel permeability for fluorescein and Cat-1 expression levels were elevated in the brain cortex and pancreas. On the ultrastructural level surface glycocalyx and mitochondrial damage, tight junction and basal membrane alterations, and glial edema were observed. L-ornithine decreased cell impedance and elevated the BBB model permeability in vitro. Discontinuity in the surface glycocalyx labeling and immunostaining of junctional proteins, cytoplasmic redistribution of ZO-1 and β-catenin, and elevation of Vcam-1 expression were measured. ROS production was increased and mitochondrial network was damaged without NF-κB, NO production or mitochondrial membrane potential alterations. Similar ultrastructural changes were seen in L-ornithine treated brain endothelial cells as in vivo. The basal negative zeta potential of brain endothelial cells became more positive after L-ornithine treatment. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated BBB damage in the L-ornithine-induced rat AP model suggesting a general, AP model independent effect. L-ornithine induced oxidative stress, decreased barrier integrity and altered BBB morphology in a culture BBB model. These data suggest a direct effect of the cationic L-ornithine on brain endothelium. Endothelial surface glycocalyx injury was revealed both in vivo and in vitro, as an additional novel component of the BBB-related pathological changes in AP.",

An unexplored alternative for females affected from X-linked diseases is the clonal selection of cells randomly silencing the X-chromosome containing the mutant allele, without in vivo or ex vivo genome editing. In this report, we have isolated dermal fibroblasts from a female patient affected of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and obtained clones based on inactivation status of either maternally or paternally inherited X chromosome, followed by differentiation to hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-like cells derived from these clones display indistinct features characteristic of hepatocytes, but express either the mutant or wild type OTC allele depending on X-inactivation pattern. When clonally derived hepatocyte-like cells were transplanted into FRG® KO mice, they were able to colonize the liver and recapitulate OTC-dependent phenotype conditioned by X-chromosome inactivation pattern. This approach opens new strategies for cell therapy of X-linked metabolic diseases and experimental in vitro models for drug development for such diseases.",

      "abstract": "L-Ornithine, an important non-essential amino acid, has considerable medicinal value in the treatment of complex liver diseases. Microbial fermentation strategies using robust engineered strains have remarkable potential for producing L-ornithine. We showed that glucose and sucrose co-utilization accumulate more L-ornithine in Corynebacterium glutamicum than glucose alone. Further manipulating the expression of intracellular fructose-1-phosphate kinase through the deletion of pfkB1resulted in the engineered strain C. glutamicum SO30 that produced 47.6 g/L of L-ornithine, which represents a 32.8% increase than the original strain C. glutamicum SO26 using glucose as substrate (35.88 g/L). Moreover, fed-batch cultivation of C. glutamicum SO30 in 5-L fermenters produced 78.0 g/L of L-ornithine, which was a 78.9% increase in yield compared with that produced by C. glutamicum SO26. These results showed that manipulating the fructose metabolic pathway increases L-ornithine accumulation and provides a reference for developing C. glutamicum to produce valuable metabolites."

Currently, there are nine FDA-approved drugs for HCC, five monoclonal antibodies and four tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) has been validated as a target in preclinical studies, which demonstrates that it is a potential target to treat HCC. Currently, there are no OAT inactivators in clinical trials for HCC. This Innovation describes evidence to support inhibition of OAT as a novel approach for HCC tumor growth inhibition. After the mechanism of OAT is discussed, the origins of our involvement in OAT inactivation, based on our previous work on mechanism-based inactivation of GABA-AT, are described. Once it was demonstrated that OAT inactivation does lead to HCC tumor growth inhibition, new selective OAT inactivators were designed and their inactivation mechanisms were elucidated. A summary of these mechanistic studies is presented. Inactivators of OAT provide the potential for treatment of HCC, targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."

      "abstract": "In all mammalian species examined thus far, the ovaries produce a burst of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and putrescine during ovulation or after application of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Aged mice have significantly reduced levels of this periovulatory ODC and putrescine rise. Putrescine supplementation, in vitro during oocyte maturation or in mouse drinking water during the periovulatory period, reduces egg aneuploidies and embryo resorption, improving fertility of aged mice. These studies suggest that periovulatory putrescine supplementation may be a simple and effective therapy for reproductive aging for women. However, putrescine supplementation is expected to increase widespread tissue putrescine levels, raising concerns of nonspecific and unwanted side effects. Given that ODC is highly expressed in the ovaries during ovulation but otherwise exhibits low activity in most tissues, we hypothesized that periovulatory supplementation of L-ornithine, the substrate of ODC, might be suitable for delivering putrescine specifically to the ovaries. In this study, we have demonstrated that systemic application of L-ornithine via oral gavage or subcutaneous injection increased ovarian putrescine levels; the increase was restricted to animals that had been injected with hCG. Furthermore, L-ornithine specifically increased ovarian putrescine levels without affecting putrescine levels in any other tissues. However, our attempts to improve fertility of aged mice through L-ornithine supplementation in mouse drinking water produced either no effects (1% L-ornithine) or negative impact on fertility (4% ornithine). Our results suggest that it might not be feasible to achieve fertility-enhancing ovarian putrescine levels via L-ornithine supplementation in drinking water without encountering undesired consequences of high dose of exogenous L-ornithine.",

We evaluated the role of intravenous LOLA in patients of cirrhosis with OHE grade III-IV. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, 140 patients were randomized to a combination of LOLA, lactulose, and rifaximin (n = 70) or placebo, lactulose, and rifaximin (n = 70). LOLA was given as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 30 g over 24 h for 5 days. Ammonia levels, TNF-α, ILs, and endotoxins were measured on days 0 and 5. The primary outcome was the improvement in the grade of HE at day 5. Higher rates of improvement in grade of HE (92.5% vs. 66%, p < 0.001), lower time to recovery (2.70 ± 0.46 vs. 3.00 ± 0.87 days, p = 0.03), and lower 28-day mortality (16.4% vs. 41.8%, p = 0.001) were seen in the LOLA group as compared with placebo. Levels of inflammatory markers were reduced in both groups. Significantly higher reductions in levels of blood ammonia, IL-6, and TNF-α were seen in the LOLA group. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of LOLA with lactulose and rifaximin was more effective than only lactulose and rifaximin in improving grades of HE, recovery time from encephalopathy, with lower 28-day mortality.",

This randomized add-on open preliminary clinical study evaluated the short-term effects of L-arginine or L-ornithine as an adjuvant to scaling and root planing (SRP) in patients with chronic periodontitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five periodontitis patients were recruited and monitored clinically and immunologically at baseline (before SRP) and 30 ± 5 days after SRP. All patients were assigned by stratified randomization to SRP (SRP only, n = 25), Arg (SRP + L-arginine, n = 25) or Control (SRP + L-ornithine, n = 25) Group. The medicines were used according to available instructions for 10 and 15 days, respectively. During the study, all patients were on a stable diet, without changing their rations and regiments. As immunological monitoring immunohistochemical study of CD68+ and CD163 + single positive gingival macrophages for 5 patients per group in the same time-point was conducted. The data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Reduction of periodontal pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BoP) was observed in all groups, with significant between-group differences for BoP in the Arg Group (p < 0.0001) at 30 days. The SRP and Arg groups demonstrated nonsignificantly increased density of CD68+ and CD163 + cells. The Orn Group showed an increase in the density of CD68+ and CD163 + macrophages at intragroup (p = 0.0066 and p < 0.0001) and between-group levels (p = 0.001 and p < 0.0001), and these changes corresponded to clinical PPD and BoP reduction. In the Arg and Orn groups at 30 days, CD163 + macrophages significantly predominated over CD68+ (p = 0.013, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The use of L-arginine and L-ornithine as an adjunct to SRP promotes additional limited immunological benefit in the treatment of periodontitis. Metabolic stimulation with L-ornithine, but not L-arginine, is preferable for CD163+ Mφs subpopulation in periodontitis-affected gingiva."

Since Velcade (bortezomib) was approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM in 2003, we have seen considerable improvement in extending MM patient survival. However, most patients are fraught with high recurrence rate and incurability. Acupuncture is known for alleviating patient symptoms and improving the quality of life, but it is not well investigated in MM, especially in combination with bortezomib. In this study, we employed LC-MS and UHPLC-MS together with bioinformatics methods to test serum samples from 5TMM3VT MM murine model mice with four different treatments [control (C) group, bortezomib (V) treatment group, acupuncture (A) group, and combined (VA) group]. MM mice in group VA had longer survival time than mice in group A or group V. Joint pathway analysis indicated the underlying arginine and proline metabolism pathway among the 32 significantly decreased metabolites in group VA. CCK-8 assay and in vivo experiments validated that ornithine, the metabolite of arginine, promoted MM cell proliferation. In addition, gene expression omnibus (GEO) database analysis suggested that MM patients with higher ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) expression were evidently associated with poor overall survival. In summary, this study demonstrates the synergistic effects of acupuncture and bortezomib on extending the survival of MM model mice and provides potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of MM."

      "abstract": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of polyamines (PAs). PAs are oncometabolites that are required for proliferation, and pharmaceutical ODC inhibition is pursued for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases. The most potent ODC inhibitor is 1-amino-oxy-3-aminopropane (APA). A previous crystal structure of an ODC-APA complex indicated that APA non-covalently binds ODC and its cofactor pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) and functions by competing with the ODC substrate ornithine for binding to the catalytic site. We have revisited the mechanism of APA binding and ODC inhibition through a new crystal structure of APA-bound ODC, which we solved at 2.49 Å resolution. The structure unambiguously shows the presence of a covalent oxime between APA and PLP in the catalytic site, which we confirmed in solution by mass spectrometry. The stable oxime makes extensive interactions with ODC but cannot be catabolized, explaining APA's high potency in ODC inhibition. In addition, we solved an ODC/PLP complex structure with citrate bound at the substrate-binding pocket. These two structures provide new structural scaffolds for developing more efficient pharmaceutical ODC inhibitors.",

Here, we aimed to establish an in vitro liver disease model of the urea cycle disorder ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) using patient-derived hiPSC-Heps. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Before modeling OTCD, we addressed the question of why hiPSC-Heps generally secrete less urea than adult primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). Because hiPSC-Heps are not completely differentiated and maintain some characteristics of fetal PHHs, we compared gene-expression levels in human fetal and adult liver tissue to identify genes responsible for reduced urea secretion in hiPSC-Heps. We found lack of aquaporin 9 (AQP9) expression in fetal liver tissue as well as in hiPSC-Heps, and showed that forced expression of AQP9 in hiPSC-Heps restores urea secretion and normalizes the response to ammonia challenge by increasing ureagenesis. Furthermore, we proved functional ureagenesis by challenging AQP9-expressing hiPSC-Heps with ammonium chloride labeled with the stable isotope [15 N] (15 NH4 Cl) and by assessing enrichment of [15 N]-labeled urea. Finally, using hiPSC-Heps derived from patients with OTCD, we generated a liver disease model that recapitulates the hepatic manifestation of the human disease. Restoring OTC expression-together with AQP9-was effective in fully correcting OTC activity and normalizing ureagenesis as assessed by 15 NH4 Cl stable-isotope challenge. CONCLUSION: Our results identify a critical role for AQP9 in functional urea metabolism and establish the feasibility of in vitro modeling of OTCD with hiPSC-Heps. By facilitating studies of OTCD genotype/phenotype correlation and drug screens, our model has potential for improving the therapy of OTCD.",

Very limited clinical data in patients are available, with a phase II study in target patients not designed for dose finding, to support phase III dose selection in a global development program. The objective of the present population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation was to evaluate dose selection for target patient populations with a low body weight, ethnicity, and hepatic impairment in a global clinical study. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model was developed based on plasma concentrations of L-ornithine, phenylacetic acid, and phenylacetylglutamine data from four clinical trials in healthy subjects and patients with stable cirrhosis or hospitalized adult patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. A covariate analysis was conducted to identify source of variability to support dose selection for global clinical development of L-ornithine phenylacetate. Phenylacetylglutamine formation in the pharmacokinetic model also quantified pharmacodynamic effects measured by ammonia removal. RESULTS: Body weight and hepatic function were significant covariates determining phenylacetic acid exposure. After accounting for body weight, there was no difference between tested Caucasian and Asian populations in phenylacetic acid exposure. Renal dysfunction significantly reduced phenylacetylglutamine excretion. However, renal impairment had no impact on plasma phenylacetic acid and free ammonia levels. Exploratory modeling suggested that L-ornithine might enhance the removal of ammonia. CONCLUSIONS: With a flat dosing algorithm, special consideration must be given to patients with a small body size (i.e., body weight ≤ 50 kg) and severe hepatic impairment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Several cancer subtypes (pancreatic, breast, liver, and colorectal) rapidly advance to higher aggressive stages in diabetes. Though hyperglycemia has been considered as a fuel for growth of cancer cells, pathways leading to this condition are still under investigation. Cellular polyamines can modulate normal and cancer cell growth, and inhibitors of polyamine synthesis have been approved for treating colon cancer, however the role of polyamines in diabetes-mediated cancer advancement is unclear as yet. We hypothesized that polyamine metabolic pathway is involved with increased proliferation of breast cancer cells under high glucose (HG) conditions. METHODS: Studies were performed with varying concentrations of glucose (5-25 mM) exposure in invasive, triple negative breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231; non-invasive, estrogen/progesterone receptor positive breast cancer cells, MCF-7; and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, MCF-10A. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in proliferation with HG (25 mM) at 48-72 h in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A cells but no such effect was observed in MCF-7 cells. This was correlated to higher activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis pathway. Inhibitor of polyamine synthesis (difluoromethylornithine, DFMO, 5 mM) was quite effective in suppressing HG-mediated cell proliferation and ODC activity in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A cells. Polyamine (putrescine) levels were significantly elevated with HG treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells. HG exposure also increased the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our cellular findings indicate that polyamine inhibition should be explored in patient population as a target for future chemotherapeutics in diabetic breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of polyamines and catalyzes the decarboxylation of ornithine to produce putrescine. Inhibition of ODC activity is a potential approach for the prevention and treatment of many diseases including cancer, as the expression levels and the activities of ODC in many abnormal cells and tumor cells are generally higher than those of normal cells. The discovery and evaluation of ODC inhibitors rely on the monitoring of the reaction processes catalyzed by ODC. There are several commonly used methods for analyzing the activity of ODC, such as measuring the yield of putrescine by high performance liquid chromatography, or quantifying the yield of isotope labelled carbon dioxide. However, the cumbersome operation and cost of these assays, as well as the difficulty to achieve high-throughput and real-time detection, hampered their applications. In this work, we optimized a real-time label-free method for analyzing the activity of ODC based on the macromolecule cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) and a fluorescent dye, DSMI (trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino) styryl]-1-methylpyridinium iodide). Finally, the optimized method was used to determine the activities of different ODC inhibitors with different inhibition mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Colletotrichum higginsianum is an important fungal pathogen causing anthracnose disease of cruciferous plants. In this study, we characterized a putative orthologue of yeast SPE1 in C. higginsianum, named ChODC. Deletion mutants of ChODC were defective in hyphal and conidial development. Importantly, deletion of ChODC significantly affected appressorium-mediated penetration in C. higginsianum. However, polyamines partially restore appressorium function and virulence indicating that loss of ChODC caused significantly decreased virulence by the crosstalk between polyamines and other metabolic pathways. Subsequently, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses demonstrated that ChODC played an important role in metabolism of various carbon and nitrogen compounds including amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids. Along with these clues, we found deletion of ChODC affected glycogen and lipid metabolism, which were important for conidial storage utilization and functional appressorium formation. Loss of ChODC affected the mTOR signalling pathway via modulation of autophagy. Interestingly, cAMP treatment restored functional appressoria to the ΔChODC mutant, and rapamycin treatment also stimulated formation of functional appressoria in the ΔChODC mutant. Overall, ChODC was associated with the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, as a mediator of cAMP and mTOR signalling pathways to regulate appressorium function. Our study provides evidence of a link between ChODC and the cAMP signalling pathway and defines a novel mechanism by which ChODC regulates infection-associated autophagy and plant infection by fungi.",

      "abstract": "The deficit of human ornithine aminotransferase (hOAT) is responsible for gyrate atrophy (GA), a rare recessive inherited disorder. Although more than 60 disease-associated mutations have been identified to date, the molecular mechanisms explaining how each mutation leads to the deficit of OAT are mostly unknown. To fill this gap, we considered six representative missense mutations present in homozygous patients concerning residues spread over the hOAT structure. E. coli expression, spectroscopic, kinetic and bioinformatic analyses, reveal that the R154L and G237D mutations induce a catalytic more than a folding defect, the Q90E and R271K mutations mainly impact folding efficiency, while the E318K and C394Y mutations give rise to both folding and catalytic defects. In a human cellular model of disease folding-defective variants, although at a different extent, display reduced protein levels and/or specific activity, due to increased aggregation and/or degradation propensity. The supplementation with Vitamin B6, to mimic a treatment strategy available for GA patients, does not significantly improve the expression/activity of folding-defective variants, in contrast with the clinical responsiveness of patients bearing the E318K mutation. Thus, we speculate that the action of vitamin B6 could be also independent of hOAT. Overall, these data represent a further effort toward a comprehensive analysis of GA pathogenesis at molecular and cellular level, with important relapses for the improvement of genotype/phenotype correlations and the development of novel treatments."

      "abstract": "To develop novel medical technologies, pig disease models are invaluable especially in the final stages of translational research. Recently, we established a genetically engineered ornithine transcarbamylase-deficient (OTCD) pig strain. Here, we report its characterization and treatment responsiveness. OTCD pigs were obtained by mating an OTCD carrier female (OTC-Xc.186_190delXWT) with a wild-type male. Due to the X-linked recessive mode of inheritance, the disease phenotype emerged only in males. Medication with nitrogen-scavenging agents was based on a clinical protocol. OTCD pigs were born smaller than their wild-type and carrier littermates, showing anemia and faltering. Biochemically, high levels of urinary orotic acid and loss of OTC activity were observed. The natural life course of OTCD pigs was characterized by a decrease in arterial percentage saturation of oxygen and body temperature, as well as an increase in blood ammonia levels; the pigs died in 24.0 ± 5.0 h (mean ± SD, n = 6). The established standard medication composed with nitrogen-scavenging agents and transfusion nearly doubled the survival time to 42.4 ± 13.7 h (n = 6). Our OTCD pig model appropriately mimicked the human pathology. Along with established protocols in handling and medication, this is a first step in developing a large animal disease model that is useful for translational research into novel medical technologies, such as cell transplantation and gene therapy, as well as in relation to urea cycle disorder."

      "abstract": "Food-borne pathogenic bacteria are dispersed throughout the entire chain of the food industry. However, many food preservatives are limited by poor biocompatibility such as cumulative poisoning. The antimicrobial peptide is increasingly regarded as a promising preservative in food research due to its high bioactivity and low cytotoxicity. In this study, thirteen peptides were designed, synthesized, and screened for application as food preservatives. One of them, termed zp65, whose sequence is GIOAOIIIOIOO-NH2, demonstrated potent bactericidal effect against common Gram-negative strains including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Citrobacter freundii. Encouragingly, zp65 showed negligible cytotoxicity to both mammalian cells and Galleria mellonella larvae. Peptide zp65 was prone to form α-helix structure in amphiphilic environments, facilitating its affinity with bacterial membrane. Furthermore, the proteolytic stability of zp65 was much higher than its derivatives consisting of totally natural amino acids. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that zp65 has a strong binding affinity to lipopolysaccharide with Kd = 1.3 μM, suggesting its possible action target on the bacterial envelope. Mechanistic studies revealed that this peptide also influenced the membrane potential of E.coli O157:H7 (O157) in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, peptide zp65 did not induce disruption of membrane permeability even at a higher concentration of 4-fold minimal inhibitory concentration. By employing confocal microscopy, peptide zp65 labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate mainly aggregated on the bacterial membrane. These results suggested that the bactericidal mode of action of zp65 is likely attributed to depolarization of the cell membrane. The minced lean beef experiment indicated that the maximum reduction of O157 reached 1.46 log colony-forming unit (CFU) per gram on day 1 after zp65 treatment at the dosage of 40 μg/g. Compared with the untreated cooked beef sample, the CFU of the zp65-treated group remained at a much lower level after 10-day storage. Subsequently, treatment with zp65 at concentrations above 32 μM also significantly reduced O157 viable counts in fresh tomato juice. And the zp65 treatment could rescue about 40% of Galleria mellonella larvae injected with O157-contaminated tomato juice. The peptide zp65 exhibits great potential and deserves further study as a candidate for food preservative.",
