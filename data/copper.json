      "abstract": "One of the first and direct signs of ionizing radiation's effect on a cell is chromosomes destabilization. By studying cytogenetic indices - including mitotic index, chromosomal aberrations, and the number of polyploid cells in the bone marrow cells of the femur, a significant difference was observed between intact and irradiated animals. This suggests that these indices can be considered as markers of irradiation by the technetium isotope. When assessing the survival rate, the highest survival value was recorded in the Group injected with [Сu(Adm)(PPh3)2]PF6. In terms of chromosomal aberrations and number of polyploid cells, irradiated animals showed reliable difference compared to the \"irradiation + [Cu(LCF3)2]\" group at both 15 and 30 days post-exposure, demonstrating the radioprotective property of the compound. Regarding the mitotic index, treatment with [Cu(LCF3)2] showed a trend toward normalization after 15 days, with a reliable difference between Groups 2 and 3 by the end of the study (after 30 days), further supporting the compound's beneficial effect. Analysis of survival, changes in cytogenetic parameters, and multivariate regression analysis when using both complexes confirms the highest efficiency of [Сu(Adm)(PPh3)2]PF6 compared to [Cu(LCF3)2]. Specifically, treatment with [Сu(Adm)(PPh3)2]PF6, in contrast to \"pure irradiation\", resulted in a significant difference across all parameters and led to the normalization of cytogenetic parameters from the early stages of observation. This suggests a pronounced radioprotective effect of the compound and an accelerated normalization of cytogenetic parameters.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Copper is an essential trace element involved in numerous enzymatic functions and physiological processes. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis (HD) may influence copper homeostasis, yet conflicting findings exist regarding copper levels in these patients and copper levels aren't routinely checked. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates serum copper concentrations in CKD and HD patients compared to healthy controls (HC), and assesses changes pre- and post-HD. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science was conducted up to February 2025. Observational studies reporting serum copper levels in CKD and HD patients were included. Data analysis were conducted using RevMan software. The data were pooled as standardized mean difference (SMD) and using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies with 13,592 participants were included. No significant difference in copper levels was observed between CKD patients and HC (SMD: -0.18, 95% CI: -1.17, 0.80; P = 0.71). However, HD patients had significantly lower copper levels compared to HC (SMD: -0.48, 95% CI: -0.89, -0.07; P = 0.02). Additionally, HD significantly reduced serum copper levels post-treatment compared to pre-HD (SMD: -0.41, 95% CI: -0.62, -0.21; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CKD does not significantly impact serum copper levels, whereas HD leads to a significant decrease in copper concentrations. The mechanisms underlying this reduction require further elucidation, and future studies should explore the potential clinical consequences of low copper levels in HD patients."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases of the aging population, with an incidence of more than 250 million affected people and annual treatment costs exceeding $80 billion. Osteoarthritis involves pain, stiffness, reduced mobility, and swelling of the joints due to cartilage wear and tear and inflammation, which results in a broad system affecting the joints. This review focuses on the relationship between zinc and copper and the effects of these minerals on osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that currently affects millions of people and is characterized by the degradation of joint cartilage and inflammation. Zinc is crucial to the development of healthy cells, including cartilage, and copper keeps cartilage in balance and improves the immune response. If these elements are imbalanced, then symptoms of osteoarthritis may worsen, and studies have revealed that people with osteoarthritis exhibit increased levels of copper, which is the active factor in inflammation and cartilage breakdown. In osteoarthritis patients, the level of zinc is decreased, yet it plays an important role in bone and cartilage formation. Zinc and copper are interrelated because zinc has antioxidant properties, while copper might have a detrimental effect on cell injury. More investigations must be conducted on the therapeutic aspects of these processes and on how to improve the treatment of osteoarthritis. Knowledge of these relationships could allow for enhanced diagnosis, proper treatment, and therapy for people with osteoarthritis, hence enhancing quality of life."

      "abstract": "Copper-quercetin complexes, CuQ, have been an active area of research for several decades. In vitro experiments show complexes are better antioxidants than quercetin alone. There seems to be a synergy effect. Cancer cell culture experiments also show prooxidant and DNA damaging properties which may be exploitable in cancer cell therapy. The effect of copper in combination with quercetin on cell death pathways needs to be investigated, especially regarding the cuproptosis pathway. CuQ complexes may require formulations similar to quercetin. The use of nanoparticles has enabled practical formulations of quercetin and/or their complexes to be made which guarantee stability, satisfactory bioavailability, and clinical effectiveness. In vivo studies are also being reported as well of planning of applications including skin infections and bone healing. Zn, Cu and quercetin tested on mice shows strong potential to treat Androgenic Alopecia. Copper-quercetin complexes seem to be easy to make and have good pharmacological potential in antimicrobial function, osteogenesis, angiogenesis and cancer treatment. Complexes such as those involving phenoanthroline, quercetin and copper may be found to be superior and zinc might be better for cancer therapy."

During a 67-day trial, a total of 300 Jingfen 8 laying hens aged 160 days were randomly allocated into four treatment groups: Control (basal diet), Cu (25 mg/kg Cu), BA (500 mg/kg BA), and Mix (a combination of 25 mg/kg Cu and 500 mg/kg BA). The results indicated that the Mix group experienced a significant decrease in egg cholesterol levels, particularly in the yolk cholesterol content, along with an enhancement in the total antioxidant capacity. Additionally, the liver cholesterol metabolism was modulated by upregulation of CYP7A1 and ABCG5, alongside downregulation of SREBP-2 and HMGCR. While Cu and BA individually showed minimal effects on production, their combination yielded a synergistic impact on lipid metabolism and antioxidant defense. However, the Mix group showed reduced liver zinc content, suggesting a Antagonistic relationship between Cu and Zn. These findings suggest that Cu and BA supplementation may enhance egg quality and metabolic health in laying hens, highlighting the importance of maintaining balanced trace element ratios in poultry diets."

      "abstract": "The rise of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria poses a severe global threat to public health, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to overcome these challenges. Copper-based nanomaterials have emerged as promising agents due to their intrinsic antibacterial properties, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability for multifunctional therapeutic approaches. These materials exhibit exceptional potential in advanced antibacterial therapies, including chemodynamic therapy (CDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Their unique physicochemical properties, such as controlled ion release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and tunable catalytic activity, enable them to target MDR bacteria effectively while minimizing off-target effects. This paper systematically reviews the mechanisms through which Cu-based nanomaterials enhance antibacterial efficiency and emphasizes their specific performance in the antibacterial field. Key factors influencing their antibacterial properties-such as electronic interactions, photothermal characteristics, size effects, ligand effects, single-atom doping, and geometric configurations-are analyzed in depth. By uncovering the potential of copper-based nanomaterials, this work aims to inspire innovative approaches that improve patient outcomes, reduce the burden of bacterial infections, and enhance global public health initiatives."

      "abstract": "Background: While gallium-68 has traditionally dominated PET imaging in oncology, copper radionuclides have sparked interest for their potential applications in nuclear medicine and theranostics. Considering the advantageous physical decay properties of copper-61 compared to those of gallium-68, we describe a fully automated GMP-compliant synthesis process for 61Cu-based radiopharmaceuticals and demonstrate their in vivo application for targeting the overexpressed PSMA by PET/MR imaging. Methods: Copper-61 was obtained through the irradiation of natural zinc liquid targets in a biomedical cyclotron. [61Cu]Cu-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T and [61Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T were produced without manual intervention in two Synthera® Extension modules. Radiochemical purity was analyzed by radio-HPLC and iTLC. Cellular uptake was evaluated in LNCaP and DU145 cells. In vivo PET/MRI was performed in control mice to evaluate the biodistribution of both radiopharmaceuticals, and in tumor-bearing mice to assess the targeting ability towards PSMA. Results: The fully automated process developed proved to be effective for the synthesis of 61Cu-based radiopharmaceuticals, with appropriate molar activities. The final products exhibited high radiochemical purity (>98%) and remained stable for up to 6 h after the EOS. A time-dependent increase in cellular uptake was observed in LNCaP cells, but not in DU145 cells. As opposed to [61Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T, [61Cu]Cu-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T exhibited poor kinetic stability in vivo. Subsequent PET/MR imaging with [61Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T showed tumor uptake lasting up to 4 h post-injection, predominant renal clearance, and no detectable accumulation in non-targeted organs. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the feasibility of the implemented process, which yields adequate amounts of high-quality radiopharmaceuticals and can be adapted to any standard production facility. This streamlined approach enhances reproducibility and scalability, bringing copper-61 closer to widespread clinical use, to the detriment of the conventionally accepted gallium-68."

      "abstract": "Amination of 1-amino-4-bromoanthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (BAA), crucial for anthraquinone-type dyes production, relies on Cu+ catalysis. However, Cu+ disproportionation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring large amounts of Cu catalysts (e.g., CuSO4 or CuCl) and reductants (e.g., FeSO4), introducing heavy metals and increasing water consumption to remove byproducts and metals, raising both environmental and economic costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a groundbreaking strategy for the in-situ generation of Cu+ using symmetrical Cu electrodes under alternating current (AC) electrolysis. This method achieves 100% conversion of BAA in the amination with 3,5-diamino-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene sulfonic acid (M Acid) with 95% yield, while also providing a solution to the issue of Cu+ disproportionation without the need for any additional copper catalysts or reductants, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and significantly reducing water usage in post-treatment. Characterization techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveal that the passive Cu2O film formed on the symmetrical Cu electrodes under AC electrolysis continuously generates Cu+, which is crucial for the reaction. This approach is scalable, environmentally friendly, and holds great potential for industrial applications, offering substantial economic benefits while reducing environmental impact."

      "abstract": "A single or repeated dose of tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) induces in humans and animals a known neuropathy as organophosphorus-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP). This syndrome is related to the inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE), causing signs and symptoms in the nervous system, such as ataxia and paralysis. Currently, there is no antidotal treatment for OPIDP. In the present study, the neuroprotective effect of Cu(II) on the acute in vivo neurotoxicity of TOCP is characterized. Adult hens (27 and 65 weeks old) were administered a single dose of 380, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg of TOCP dissolved in vegetable oil. One hour before, the animals were administered a single dose of 160 mg/kg of Cu(II) or vehicle by the same route. Twenty-four hours later, half of the animals (n = 5) in each group were decapitated to obtain the brain and blood (serum) for measuring NTE, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), cholinesterases (ChEs), and kidney and hepatic biochemical parameters (ALT, AST, creatinine, urea). The other half of the animals in each group were kept under observation for 21 days for clinical evaluation of OPIDP using a scale from 1 to 4. The 24-h brain NTE residual activity of all TOCP-treated groups was around 5 % (∼95 % inhibition) compared to the control group (vehicles). However, the group of hens treated with 380 mg/kg TOCP (27 weeks old) pre-treated with Cu(II) presented significantly higher brain NTE activity (p < 0.05), which was around 55 %. This activity value correlated with the OPIDP clinical score over 21 days. Hens treated with TOCP showed an OPIDP score of 3, whereas those pre-treated with Cu(II) showed no signs of OPIDP. The protective effect of Cu(II) on brain NTE and serum ChEs inhibition levels was associated with the degree of OPIDP. The levels of both activities decreased with the increase in OPIDP score (1-4) due to higher TOCP doses and the age of the hens. Brain AChE inhibition ranged from 16 % to 43 %, and hens showed no cholinergic signs in any group. The dose of Cu(II) used in this in vivo study demonstrated a neuroprotective effect and did not induce adverse effects in the liver and kidneys. However, it will be necessary to carry out specific experimental studies to investigate the neuroprotective mechanism of Cu(II)."

      "abstract": "Copper ion (Cu2+) has been revealed to be involved in the occurrence and development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), making copper-mediated chemodynamic therapy (Cu-CDT) a promising treatment strategy for OSCC by elevating Cu2+ levels to generating a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the excessive reduced glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment can scavenge the ROS generated by Cu-CDT. While the directional co-delivery of Cu2+ and GSH-depleting agents shows promise for Cu-CDT in OSCC therapy, their rapid metabolism and the superficial nature of OSCC lesions necessitate tailored drug formulations to ensure effective bioavailability. To counteract this challenge, this work proposed a practical hydrogel-supported ROS-GSH regulation strategy, which involves the on-demand design of a copper ion-crosslinked guanosine-based hydrogel (GCD) containing dimethyl fumarate (DMF, which conjugates with GSH for consumption). It can directionally and sustainably co-deliver Cu2+ and DMF to OSCC lesions under mildly acidic pH conditions, thereby enhancing Cu-CDT efficiency through improved Cu2+ utilization and DMF-driven GSH depletion. As anticipated, the strategy sustains the generation of hydroxyl radicals, effectively inducing apoptosis and suppressing cell proliferation in CAL-27 cells, which consequently inhibits the growth of OSCC tumors. Therefore, this work highlights the GCD hydrogel's great potential as a promising Cu-CDT therapeutic platform."

It exhibits excellent performance in catalytic Fenton-like reactions for RhB removal at an ultrahigh initial concentration of up to 1000 ppm. To be specific, Fe3O4 and Cu nanoparticles are generated in situ on a mesoporous CA support, denoted as an Fe3O4-Cu/CA catalyst. Experimentally, factors including initial dye concentration, catalyst dosage, H2O2 dosage, pH, and temperature, which significantly influence the oxidative degradation rate of RhB, are carefully studied. The RhB (1000 ppm) degradation ratio reaches 93.7% within 60 min under low catalyst and H2O2 dosage. The catalyst also shows slight metal leaching (almost 1.4% of total Fe and 4.0% of total Cu leached after a complete degradation of 25 μmol RhB under conditions of 15 mg catalyst dosage, 20 mL RhB solution (600 ppm), and 200 μL 30 wt% H2O2 dosage, at pH of 2.5, at 40 °C), good catalytic activity for degrading organic pollutants, excellent reusability, and good catalytic stability (the degradation ratio is nearly 82.95% in the 8th cycle reaction). The synergistic effect between Fe and Cu species plays a vital role in promoting the redox cycle of Fe(III)/Fe(II) and enhancing the generation of ·OH. It is suitable for ultrahigh-concentration organic pollutant degradation in practical wastewater treatment applications."

A full characterization of a designed product includes the evaluation of its impact on specific biological systems, including the study of cell behavior as a response to that particular interaction. Copper and copper-based nanoparticles (CuO NPs) have emerged as valuable building blocks for various biomedical applications such as antibacterial and disinfecting agents for infectious diseases, and the evaluation of the metabolism of food, including the iron required for proteins and enzymes or as drug delivery systems in cancer therapy. In this study, the biological impact of manganese-doped crystalline copper oxide (CuO:Mn) nano-platelets on human normal BJ fibroblasts and human A375 skin melanoma was assessed. The particles were synthesized at room temperature via the hydrothermal method. A complete physicochemical characterization of the materials was performed by employing various techniques including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. Morphological investigations revealed a flat structure with nearly straight edges, with sizes spanning in the nanometer range. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of the CuO phase with good crystallinity, while XPS provided insights into the Mn doping. The findings indicate that nano-platelets interact with cells actively by mediating essential molecular processes. The exogenous manganese triggers increased MnSOD production in mitochondria, compensating ROS produced by external stress factors (Cu2+ ions), and mimics the endogenous SODs production, which compensates internal ROS production as it normally results from cell biochemistry. The effect is differentiated in normal cells compared to malignant cells and deserves investigation."

      "abstract": "Sodium copper chlorophyllin (chlorophyllin, CHL), a semi-synthetic water-soluble derivative of green plant pigment chlorophyll, is associated with potential health benefits; however, systematic preclinical evaluation of its pharmacological and therapeutic potential remains limited. This study investigates safety, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of CHL as an adjunct to breast cancer chemotherapy. Acute and sub-acute oral toxicity of CHL was assessed in mice and rats under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions following OECD guidelines. Anti-cancer effects and mechanisms were evaluated in 4 T1mouse breast cancer cells using viability assays, colony formation analysis, and proteomics. Cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced painful bladder syndrome (PBS) was studied in C57BL/6 female mice. In acute toxicity study, up to 5000 mg/kg bw of CHL was well tolerated without any signs of toxicity and death. In the sub-acute toxicity study, no features suggestive of drug-induced toxicity indicated No-Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) to be beyond 1000 mg/kg bw. CHL showed wide biodistribution, achieving sustained therapeutic concentrations in target tissues. CHL enhanced the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of CYP in 4 T1 breast cancer cells, and proteomics studies revealed disruption in DNA damage repair, microtubule dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to apoptosis. CHL (100 mg/kg bw, oral) showed significant therapeutic benefit for treatment of CYP induced PBS. CHL alleviated PBS symptoms by restoring IL- 22 levels, reducing oxidative stress, and improving bladder functionality. Chlorophyllin appears to be relatively safe even at high doses, demonstrates potentially favorable pharmacology, and may hold promise for mitigating CYP-induced bladder toxicity and enhancing chemotherapy efficacy."

      "abstract": "Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive condition characterized by valve calcification and significant morbidity, often requiring invasive intervention. The AS pathophysiology is multifaceted, with evidence suggesting a role for trace elements. However, whether zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are associated with valve calcification is unclear. This exploratory study assessed the Zn and Cu levels in the serum and aortic valves of AS patients undergoing surgical valve replacement and explored the relationships between trace elements and clinical and biochemical parameters to better understand their potential roles in AS pathophysiology. An inverse relationship was observed between serum Zn levels and systolic pressure gradients across the valve (p < 0.0001). Zn accumulation was identified in calcified aortic valves, suggesting a systemic redistribution of Zn during disease progression. The valvular Cu/Zn ratio was reversed (<1) compared to that in serum. The lipoprotein(a), an inflammatory marker, was positively correlated with serum Cu levels (p = 0.0007) and the Cu/Zn ratio (p = 0.02). However, no direct association was found between valvular Cu content and the AS severity. The findings suggest that Zn depletion in serum, coupled with its accumulation in calcified valves, reflects a disease-driven redistribution mechanism that may serve a protective role against calcification progression. Additionally, the study highlights a potential interplay between Cu metabolism and inflammatory processes in AS. Further research is required to determine whether therapeutic modulation of Zn levels could offer benefits in AS management."

      "abstract": "Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) presents a promising approach for sustainable water denitrification. Yet its practical implementation is hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we develop a nitrogen-doped carbon supported cobalt-copper dual-atom catalyst (CoCu-NC DAC) to significantly enhance the electro-catalytic NO3RR performance. The optimized CoCu-NC DAC demonstrates exceptional activity, achieving a faraday efficiency of 95.3 % and a high NH4+ yield rate of 2.41 mg h-1 cm-2 at -0.6 VRHE, surpassing the performance of conventional Cu/Co single-atom catalysts. In-situ analysis and density functional theory calculations confirm that the synergistic effects arising from (1) optimized electronic structure for balanced intermediate adsorption, and (2) enhanced surface H concentration facilitating NOx hydrogenation. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the DACs, but also offers a practical solution for groundwater nitrate remediation, opening new avenues for the application of atomically dispersed catalysts."

Current treatments primarily rely on localized therapies, which can lead to adverse effects such as hyperglycemia and Cushing's syndrome with repeated use. To address these issues, we developed a hyaluronic acid-based separable microneedle patch (Dic@pCu-HA MN), integrating polydopamine-coordinated copper-based metal-organic frameworks (pCu-MOFs) and the anti-inflammatory agent dictamnine (Dic), for synergistic management of AD and its neuropsychiatric comorbidities. pCu-MOFs exhibited dual functionality as nanocargo for hydrophobic Dic (encapsulation efficiency: 84.62 ± 2.14%) and multienzyme mimics that efficiently scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) (superoxide radical scavenging: 63.85 ± 0.34%). In vitro release studies demonstrated ROS-responsive Dic release of 86.80 ± 4.83% over 48 h under AD pathology-mimicking conditions. In a 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD mouse model, the Dic@pCu-HA MN significantly reduced oxidative stress (8-OHdG: 85.1 ± 7.0% decrease), suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4: 70.0 ± 7.8% decrease vs control), and restored skin barrier integrity. By modulating the HPA axis, the system attenuated neuroinflammation and alleviated itching (scratching frequency: 40.1 ± 41.3% reduction) and depression-like behavior (time in the bright box: 96.6 ± 156.2% increase). This combined therapeutic approach not only offers a comprehensive strategy for AD management but also provides potential benefits for addressing inflammatory skin disorders and their neuropsychiatric sequelae."

      "abstract": "A surface treatment of amorphous alloy was conducted using reciprocating friction, and precursors with varying degrees of surface roughness were selectively etched to form a three-dimensional nanoporous structure with interconnected networks. The wear behavior induced by friction facilitates dealloying to different extents. While altering the surface roughness of the amorphous alloy, this method preserves its unique structure and maintains the advantages of the precursor in preparing nanoporous materials (NPMs). Under identical dealloying conditions, the thickness of the nanoporous copper layer on the rougher surface (with a surface roughness of approximately 0.808) is significantly greater than that on the smoother surface (with a surface roughness of approximately 0.002), and this disparity increases over time. The findings indicate that friction-induced changes in surface roughness play a crucial role in the preparation of nanoporous copper via dealloying. Modifying the surface roughness through friction can enhance the dealloying process, improve the adhesion between the nanoporous copper (NP-Cu) layer and the amorphous matrix, and mitigate crack propagation during NP-Cu formation and under stress. Selecting an appropriate level of roughness can enhance the long-term stability of NP-Cu."

      "abstract": "Copper is widely used in both its metallic form and as oxide across numerous scientific and industrial domains. The primary copper oxides, cuprite (Cu2O) and tenorite (CuO), naturally form on the copper surface and play a crucial role in advanced technologies, such as solar cells, lithium batteries, and sensors. Tenorite is appreciated for its optical properties, stability, low toxicity, and reactivity. While copper oxide thin films are traditionally synthesized through thermal treatments and oxidation in alkaline environments, these conventional high-temperature methods not only require significant energy consumption but can also compromise the metal-film interface. This study aims to develop a sustainable alternative approach for forming a homogeneous CuO layer on a copper substrate through environmentally friendly treatments based on low temperature, cost-effective, and time-saving procedures. Three different eco-conscious treatments were investigated: (i) immersion in NaOH basic solution, (ii) exposure to NaOH basic solution vapours, and (iii) a combined treatment involving both immersion and vapour exposure. This green synthesis approach significantly reduces energy consumption compared to traditional thermal methods while maintaining product quality. The surface oxide layer was investigated through an optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), spectrocolorimetric analysis, peel-off test, µ-Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to investigate the surface oxidation state."

Characterization revealed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles self-assembled onto MXene sheets, forming a structure that enhanced the 2D structure of MXene, with nanoparticles uniformly distributed throughout the nanosheet network. Performance experiments demonstrated that Fe3O4@MXene nanocomposite significantly outperformed pristine MXene in adsorbing heavy metal ions from wastewater. Notably, Fe3O4@MXene nanocomposite achieved an 83% removal efficiency for Cu ions, highlighting its potential as a highly efficient adsorbent in industrial wastewater treatment.

      "abstract": "Bone-related diseases pose a major challenge in contemporary society, with significant implications for both health and economy. Copper, a vital trace metal in the human body, facilitates a wide range of physiological processes by being crucial for the function of proteins and enzymes. Numerous studies have validated copper's role in bone regeneration and protection, particularly in the development and expansion of bone collagen. Owing to copper's numerous biological advantages, an increasing number of scientists are endeavoring to fabricate novel, multifunctional copper-containing biomaterials as an effective treatment strategy for bone disorders. This review integrates the current understanding regarding the biological functions of copper from the molecular and cellular levels, highlighting its potential for bone regeneration and protection. It also reviews the novel fabrication techniques for developing copper-containing biomaterials, including copper-modified metals, calcium phosphate bioceramics, bioactive glasses, bone cements, hydrogels and biocomposites. The fabrication strategies and various applications of these biomaterials in addressing conditions such as fractures, bone tumors, osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and osteonecrosis are carefully elaborated. Moreover, the long-term safety and toxicity assessments of these biomaterials are also presented. Finally, the review addresses current challenges and future prospects, in particular the regulatory challenges and safety issues faced in clinical implementation, with the aim of guiding the strategic design of multifunctional copper-based biomaterials to effectively manage bone-related diseases."

      "abstract": "This study aims to develop an efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective composite for antibacterial and catalytic applications. In this work, copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) was anchored onto the surface of cellulose aerogel (CA) derived from corn husk waste to create a multifunctional material. The deposition of CuNPs onto the surface of the CA is achieved using a straightforward wet reduction process of a precursor of copper (II) solution, employing glucose as both the reducing and stabilizing agent. In order to determine the characterization of the synthesized composite samples, several physicochemical analyses were investigated, including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared (FT-IR) techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and selected area diffraction (SAED). The result showed that the average size of CuNPs detected at approximately 10 ± 5 nm was immobilized and well dispersed on the CA fibers. Besides, antibacterial efficacy of cellulose aerogel decorated with CuNPs was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella spp. using the absorption method, following the ISO 20743: 2013 standard. The results demonstrated that the antibacterial effectiveness of CuNPs varied among bacterial species, highlighting the influence of bacterial cell wall structure on CuNP susceptibility. The 2.5Cu/CA sample, containing 2.5 % CuNPs, exhibited high antibacterial activity against E. coli (99.6 %), B. cereus (99.98 %), and Salmonella spp. (88.00 %), confirming its strong potential for antimicrobial applications. In contrast, S. aureus exhibited higher resistance to CuNP treatment, with only 52.35 % bacterial reduction, likely due to its thick peptidoglycan layer, which may act as a barrier against CuNP penetration and ROS diffusion. In addition, the suitable composite 2.5Cu/CA was continually conducted to examine the catalytic activity in reducing p-nitrophenol with the presence of NaBH4 as a reductant agent. After 5 min, the catalytic performance under the optimal condition recorded a conversion efficiency >95.0 % with an apparent rate constant of 0.789 min-1. Therefore, these findings signify the opening of new avenues in fabricating innovative hybrid material with multiple applications in the biomedical and catalytic fields using a facile, cost-effective, and sustainable synthetic method."

      "abstract": "Copper is a trace element which is essential for biological organisms, and its homeostatic balance is important for living organisms to maintain the normal function. When the copper homeostasis is disordered, the cellular function and structure will be disrupted. Excess copper cause oxidative stress and DNA damage in cells, thereby inducing regulated cell death such as apoptosis and necroptosis. Excess copper in mitochondria can bind to lipoylated proteins in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and cause them to aggregate, resulting in proteotoxic stress and eliciting a novel cell death modality: cuproptosis. Cancer cells have a greater demand for copper compared to normal tissue, and high levels of copper ions are closely associated with tumour proliferation and metastasis. The anti-tumor mechanisms of copper include the production of oxidative stress, inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suppression of angiogenesis, and induction of copper-dependent cell death. Targeting copper is one of the current directions in oncology research, including the use of copper ion carriers to increase intracellular copper levels to induce oxidative stress and cuproptosis, as well as the use of copper ion chelators to reduce copper bioavailability. However, copper complexes have certain toxicity, so their biosafety needs to be improved. Emerging nanotechnology is expected to solve this problem by utilizing copper-based nanomaterials (Cu-based NMs) to deliver copper ions and a variety of drugs with different functions, thereby improving the anti-tumor efficacy and reducing the side effects. Therefore, a thorough understanding of copper metabolic processes and the mechanism of cuproptosis will greatly benefit anti-tumor therapy. This review summarizes the processes of copper metabolism and the mechanism of cuproptosis. In addition, we discuss the current anti-tumor paradigms related to copper, we also discuss current nanotherapeutic approaches to copper mortality and provide prospective insights into the future copper-mediated cancer therapy."

HA-CuNPs have been characterized by several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, such as FESEM, STEM, UV-Vis, DLS, zeta potential, FTIR and XRD analyses. The average particle size and surface zeta potential of HA-CuNPs were determined to be 35 nm and -28 mV, respectively. The catalytic activity of HA-CuNPs was investigated in the oxidative degradation of morin dye in the presence of H2O2. The kinetic data show that the oxidation process follows a pseudo-first-order reaction, and the rate constant is dependent on the concentrations of morin, H2O2, and HA-CuNPs. In addition, HA-CuNPs were employed for the selective oxidation of morin on four important synthetic dyes, i.e., Congo red, methylene blue, zinc-phthalocyanine, and quinizarin. The high selectivity indicates the possible use of HA-CuNPs as low-temperature bleach catalysts for the oxidation of stains such as tea, coffee, and red wine, which contain polyphenolic compounds like morin. Further, cytotoxicity studies demonstrated the low toxicity and high biocompatibility of HA-CuNPs to Caco-2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and HUVEC normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Combining biocompatibility with high catalytic activity could boost the potential of this eco-friendly nanocatalyst in various applications, such as wastewater treatment, laundry, textile, and wood pulp bleaching."

However, antibacterial materials with highly efficient ONOO- controlled release properties are lacking. In this study, hollow copper single atom nanozyme (Cu HSAz) with oxidase (OXD)-mimicking property is rationally designed and used for the first time as effective delivery carrier for the NO donor N, N'-di-sec-butyl-N, N'-dinitroso-1, 4-phenylenediamine (BNN6), obtaining the nanozyme Cu HSAz@BNN6. Upon near infrared (NIR)-II laser irradiation, Cu HSAz@BNN6 simultaneously releases substantial amounts of NO and O2 •-, which subsequently lead to the ONOO-boosting via a cascade reaction. Remarkably, ONOO- displays excellent antibacterial efficiency by considerably inhibiting the activity of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity. Moreover, ONOO- is effective in treating MRSA-associated wound infections and promoting wound healing. An antibacterial mechanism study reveals that ONOO-triggers MRSA death by firstly damaging the MRSA membrane, followed by destructing MRSA metabolism to cut the adenosine triphosphate energy supply and boosts intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, which subsequently depletes intracellular glutathione and caused DNA breakage."

This study evaluated the effects of plum tree biochar levels (0, 15, 30, and 45 g kg-1 soil) with and without copper sulfate (200 mg kg-1 soil), nickel sulfate (400 mg kg-1 soil), and their combination on dill plants in a factorial experiment with a randomized complete block design in three replicates. The results indicated that the presence of copper and nickel in the soil had detrimental effects on the growth and physiological performance of dill. Specifically, copper stress alone reduced biomass by 31%, nickel stress by 27%, and their combined treatment by 37.7%. On the other hand, incorporating biochar into the soil decreased the uptake of heavy metals, oxidative stress, and the production of osmotic regulators in the plants, while enhanced nutrient uptake (N, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Zn), photosynthetic pigments, and plant biomass. Increasing biochar application rate in the soil did not have any additional beneficial effect on growth and physiological characteristics of plants. These results suggest that the low rate of biochar (15 g kg-1) from agricultural wastes is an appropriate soil amendment to remediate copper and nickel pollutants in the rhizosphere to enhance nutrient availability and plant performance. Future research could focus on the long-term efficacy of biochar under diverse field conditions, soil types, and plant species to optimize sustainable agricultural practices.",

GOx continues to supply H2O2 to CDT by consuming glucose, while cutting off the supply of nutrients to starve cancer cells to death (ST), ultimately amplifying the therapeutic effect of CDT. CuFACDs-TPP precisely anchors mitochondria to destroy mitochondria and induce apoptosis, while copper ions consume glutathione to amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Self‑oxygenation of HCFCTG by Fenton-like reaction down-regulates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) to consolidate CDT effect. The 808 nm laser activates the photothermal effect enhances CDT. In vitro and in vivo experiments proved that HCFCTG has good biocompatibility and excellent CDT effect. HCFCTG overcomes the problem of insufficient H2O2 in the CDT process."

      "abstract": "The two-stage pH-controlled fluidized-bed non-seeded granulation process for treating Cu and Pb was explored. This investigation specifically examined operational conditions including Cu-to-Pb molar ratio (MR1), metal-to-carbonate molar ratio (MR2), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and first-stage pH (pH1). Multilayered, spherical, brittle, light blue granules were recovered. X-ray diffraction only detected cerussite (PbCO3) crystals, while the Pb Pourbaix diagram and solubility curve confirmed the cerussite stability. Meanwhile, the presence of bicarbonate could feasibly alter the prevailing voltage potential, generating the Cu-hydroxide interface in water. Furthermore, copper species in granules possibly formed amorphous solids due to low copper levels and inhibition of ionic Pb. Besides PbCO3 crystals, the development of amorphous Cu-carbonate hydroxide could also occur during granulation. The transition to pH 8.0 in the second stage could affect the solid solubility and the surface charge influencing the accumulation and the agglomeration, respectively. Operational conditions also significantly impacted particle growth, total removal, and accumulation rates. The sub-optimal condition was found at MR1 = 5.0, MR2 = 1.5, HRT = 22.5 min, and pH1 = 7.5 producing relatively high percentages of large granules, high removal efficiencies > 99 %, and accumulation rates between 80 % and 95 %."

      "abstract": "Vascular calcification (VC), a common pathological condition, is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and associated mortality. Development and progression of VC heavily rely on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and are closely related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and remodelling of extracellular matrix (ECM). Copper (Cu), an essential microelement, participates in these processes, but its involvement in pathophysiology of VC and VSMCs physiology remains poorly investigated. In the present study, we analysed the impact of Cu on the calcification of human aortic primary VSMCs induced in vitro by treatment with high calcium and phosphate levels. Supplementation with physiological micromolar doses of Cu significantly reduced the amount of calcium deposited on VSMCs as compared to moderate deficiency, Cu restriction with chelators or Cu excess. Moreover, optimal concentrations of Cu ions increased protein production by VSMCs, stimulated their metabolic activity, inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity associated with cell-conditioned medium and cellular lysates, and prevented osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs. RNA-seq results indicated that high calcium and phosphate treatments activated many pathways related to oxidative stress and inflammation in VSMCs at the initial stage of calcification. At the same time, expression of VSMCs-specific markers and certain components of ECM were downregulated. Supplementation of calcifying cells with 10 μM Cu prevented most of the transcriptomic alterations induced by high calcium and phosphate while chelation-mediated restriction of Cu greatly aggravated them. In summary, physiological concentration of Cu impedes in vitro calcification of VSMCs, prevents their osteogenic transition and minimises early phenotypic alterations induced by high calcium and phosphate, thereby underlining the importance of Cu homeostasis for the physiology of VSMCs, one of the cornerstones of cardiovascular health. Our data suggest that features of Cu metabolism and its status should be considered when developing preventive and therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular diseases.",

To achieve the desired performance standards, single-doped PPF or CF, and single-doped or double-doped multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/graphene oxide (GO) have been used as reinforcing materials to prepare environmentally friendly copper slag-based cement (CSC) composites. SEM analysis was conducted to investigate and assess the ordered structure of MWCNTs and GO. Subsequently, a solution of MWCNT/GO nanoparticles was generated by dispersing MWCNT/GO with a gum Arabic (AG) surfactant. Following ultrasonic treatment, the clear liquid was collected and combined with 30% solid waste copper slag and 70% cement to form a composite cementitious matrix. The inclusion of carbon nanomaterials enhanced the sample's compressive strength by over 41.6% compared to the control samples. It was equivalent to 97.1% of blank group C0, and the bending strength was about 93.8% of C0 group of the same age. In addition, the hydration products, gelation and crystallization, pore structure and microstructure of CSC materials were analyzed by quantitative X-ray diffraction (QXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption specific surface area and porosity measurement (BET). The CSC sample, with double-doped optimized MWCNT/GO exhibited the most favorable microstructure and strongest nucleation effect. As a result, the hydration degree of the CSC cementitious material was improved, which contributed to the formation of a greater amount of amorphous calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) phase, a finer C-A-S-H phase. The samples doping a combination of MWCNTs and GO exhibited synergistic enhancement. This novel nanocomposite cementitious material incorporated carbon nanoparticles into the mixture with solid waste, resulting in a solid composite cementitious material. The production of reinforced concrete is based on solid waste and demonstrates significant environmental advantages."

      "abstract": "The three-dimensional particle electrode system exhibits significant potential for application in the treatment of wastewater. Nonetheless, the advancement of effective granular electrodes characterized by elevated catalytic activity and minimal energy consumption continues to pose a significant challenge. In this research, Fluorine-doped copper-carbon (F/Cu-GAC) particle electrodes were effectively synthesized through an impregnation-calcination technique, utilizing granular activated carbon as the carrier and fluorine-doped modified copper oxides as the catalytic agents. The particle electrodes were subsequently utilized to promote the degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) in a three-dimensional electrocatalytic reactor (3DER). The F/Cu-GAC particle electrodes were polarized under the action of electric field, which promoted the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction in which H2O2 generated by two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) of O2 was catalytically decomposed to •OH. The 3DER equipped with F/Cu-GAC particle electrodes showed 100% removal of 2,4,6-TCP and 79.24% removal of TOC with a specific energy consumption (EC) of approximately 0.019 kWh/g·COD after 2 h of operation. The F/Cu-GAC particle electrodes exhibited an overpotential of 0.38 V and an electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 715 cm², as determined through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) assessments. These findings suggest a high level of electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of the 3DER equipped with F/Cu-GAC particle electrodes was elucidated through the application of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin resonance (ESR), and active species capture experiments. This investigation offers a novel approach for the effective degradation of 2,4,6-TCP.",

      "abstract": "Bone defects caused by trauma, tumors, or infections pose significant challenges to clinical treatment because of the complex pathological microenvironment they create. Elevated levels of inflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the defect site disrupt the bone immune microenvironment, impeding bone regeneration. Concurrently, the vascular damage frequently associated with bone defects leads to hypoxia, further complicating therapeutic efforts. Although bone grafting remains a primary clinical approach, its efficacy is limited by these adverse conditions. In this study, a ZnO-CuS/F127 nanozyme hydrogel with multiple enzymatic activities was manufactured for bone defect repair via the modulation of the bone immune microenvironment and the promotion of osteo-/angiogenesis, which was accomplished via the encapsulation of ZnO-CuS nanoflowers synthesized via calcination into the F127 hydrogel matrix. ZnO-CuS bimetallic nanoenzymes exhibit robust catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase-like activities, enabling effective scavenging of diverse ROS species in vitro. In cellular assays, ZnO-CuS/F127 protected bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)] from ROS-induced cytotoxicity and promoted macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, thus modulating the bone immune microenvironment. The ZnO-CuS/F127 hydrogel demonstrated potent proangiogenic and pro-osteogenic effects, attributed to its ability to upregulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway while inhibiting the NF-κB pathway in BMSCs, as confirmed by RNA sequencing. In vivo, the hydrogel exhibited exceptional hemostatic performance and facilitated bone defect repair in mouse hemorrhage and rat bone defect models while maintaining high biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. This study highlights the use of the ZnO-CuS/F127 nanozyme hydrogel as a promising therapeutic strategy for bone defect repair. By modulating the immune microenvironment and promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis, this multifunctional hydrogel offers innovative insights and a potential clinical solution for addressing the multifaceted challenges of bone regeneration."

METHODS: Comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation and laboratory testing (including serum copper, protein electrophoresis, immunofixation) were performed. Surgical interventions were DMEK (right eye) and subsequently DSO (left eye), with postoperative monitoring. Anatomic pathology of the surgical specimen was also analyzed. RESULTS: Ophthalmological evaluation revealed bilateral central corneal deposits at Descemet\\x{2019}s membrane. Elevated serum copper and high levels of gamma globulin with absence of malignancy in bone marrow biopsy confirmed MGUS by the hematologist. As to ocular treatment,DMEK initially improved visual acuity but deposits recurred within a year, decreasing vision by 18 months. DSO achieved corneal clearing and improved vision at 3 months, showing promising early results. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral corneal copper deposition can be a presenting sign of MGUS, mandating systemic investigation. While DMEK offered temporary improvement although recurrence occurred. DSO shows potential as a therapeutic alternative. Recognizing these ocular findings is critical for timely MGUS diagnosis and monitoring, though optimal corneal treatment requires further research."

      "abstract": "This study evaluates the efficiency of alkali-activated Egyptian calcium bentonite, obtained from the El Alamein region in northern Egypt, for the removal of copper (Cu2⁺), lead (Pb2⁺), and nickel (Ni2⁺) from synthetic wastewater. The bentonite samples underwent a series of preparation steps, including crushing, ball milling, magnetic separation, acid treatment with 0.1N acetic acid, and alkali activation using 5% sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Various analytical techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), cation exchange capacity (CEC) measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and free swelling analysis, were employed to characterize the materials. Absorption experiments were performed to examine the effects of pH, temperature, starting metal concentration, bentonite dose, and contact duration on heavy metal removal. The characterization results confirmed that montmorillonite was the predominant mineral in both the natural and activated bentonite samples. Adsorption studies indicated a significant improvement in heavy metal removal efficiency after activation. Under optimal conditions (pH 7, 1 g/L adsorbent dose, 120 min contact time, 20 mg/L initial metal concentration, and 20 °C), the maximum adsorption capacities of the activated bentonite were determined as 14 ± 0.03 mg/g for Cu2+, 13 ± 0.04 mg/g for Pb2+, and 12.2 ± 0.05 mg/g for Ni2+, exceeding those of the natural bentonite, which recorded capacities of 9.2 ± 0.04 mg/g, 9 ± 0.03 mg/g, and 8 ± 0.02 mg/g, respectively. Adsorption equilibrium data according to the Langmuir isotherm model, exhibiting high correlation values (R2 = 0.9979 for Cu2+, 0.9972 for Pb2+, and 0.9973 for Ni2+). Moreover, kinetic modeling demonstrated that the adsorption followed a pseudo-second-order mechanism, suggesting an intense chemisorption process. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic, demonstrating enhanced adsorption at higher temperatures."

We synthesized a new series of ionizable phospholipid nanoparticles and optimized a phospholipid nanoparticle (1AP24) for delivering STING mRNA, increasing the expression of STING protein to bind more MSA-2. Second, we synthesized copper-modified MSA-2 (MSA-2-Cu), which induced cell death by Cu2+ toxicity.

Clinical treatments face the problem of bacterial resistance and most therapies focus on a single function, lacking the multifunctional treatment of antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and osteogenic properties. In our study, we developed a copper-cerium bimetallic oxide (CuCeOx) nanozyme with near-infrared (NIR) light responsiveness for the periodontitis therapy. Under the excitation of 808 nm NIR light, CuCeOx displayed excellent photodynamic and photothermal activities, efficiently generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat. After the treatment of the CuCeOx/NIR system, the inhibition rate of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), the main periodontitis pathogen, reached 98.69 ± 0.23 % in vitro. Without the NIR light irradiation, CuCeOx, acting as a nanozyme, exhibited enzyme-like activity in scavenging ROS, effectively alleviating the cellular oxidative stress. Furthermore, CuCeOx significantly mitigated the cellular inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and promoted osteogenesis under the oxidative stress condition. Notably, the CuCeOx exhibited excellent blood compatibility (hemolysis < 5 %). The efficacy of the CuCeOx/NIR system in vivo was also investigated. H&E staining results demonstrated a significant reduction in periodontal tissue inflammation following treatment. Micro-CT analysis revealed that CuCeOx effectively inhibited the alveolar bone loss. Additionally, we found CuCeOx regulated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the multifunctional nanomaterial CuCeOx provides a promising strategy for the treatment of periodontitis."

They have enhanced activity, greater selectivity and reduced side effects compared to their predecessors, cisplatin and its analogues. On the other hand, polyamine metabolism is often deregulated in cancer, leading to increased intracellular concentrations of polyamines that promote cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. In the present work, we report the synthesis and characterization of a family of mono- and binuclear Ru(II) and Cu(II) complexes functionalized with polyamine ligands derived from norspermine. The computer-aided analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra provided magnetic and dynamic parameters, which helped to identify prevalent Cu-N2 coordination in a partially distorted square planar geometry of the Cu(II) complexes and the flexibility of the complexes in solution, slowed down by both the complex size and the hydrophobic interactions between chains. In vitro studies focused on advanced prostate cancer have demonstrated that these new metal complexes present a high level of cytotoxicity against PC3 cells. Furthermore, these metallic compounds exhibit the ability to inhibit cell adhesion and migration while reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, which are key factors of metastasis."

      "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy offers hope for improved outcomes in lung cancer treatment, but its effectiveness is restricted by the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in a limited response rate (< 20%). Here this study reports a tumor-site glutathione (GSH)/glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) dual-depletion strategy to induce tumor ferroptosis and amplify cuproptosis via a GSH-responsive polydopamine-based hybrid nanoparticle (termed CACuPDA). This approach triggers cellular lysis to reverse immunosuppressive TME and further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of lung tumors combined with anti-PD-L1-based ICB therapy. The released cinnamaldehyde (CA) can stimulate reactive oxygen species production, while Cu2+ can directly deplete GSH and suppress GPX4. Interestingly, Cu2+ induces cuproptosis by downregulating ferredoxin (FDX1) expression, whereas reduced Cu+ can catalyze hydroxyl radicals (·OH) generation from overexpressed H2O2 at the tumor site. The redox imbalance amplifies ferroptosis and cuproptosis in lung tumor cells, releasing substantial amounts of cellular contents into the immunosuppressive TME, as evidenced by an increased amount of cytotoxic T cells and a decreased amount of immunosuppressive Treg cells. In addition, in vivo experimental results revealed that CACuPDA enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 by about fivefold for lung tumor treatment, providing a promising strategy to improve ICB therapy for lung tumors."

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of tumors relies heavily on a continuous supply of essential nutrients, including glucose and copper. Disrupting the nutrient supply to tumors has become an increasingly focal point in tumor therapy. However, solely blocking the energy supply typically only hinders further tumor growth and may not effectively eliminate existing tumor cells. Herein, a multifunctional cascade nanoreactor (HPP/TPEN@GC) endowed with N, N, N', N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN, a copper chelator) and glucose oxidase (GOx) is designed to disrupt both glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, which further induce cascade chemodynamic therapy (CDT). HPP/TPEN@GC can react with endogenous copper and glucose, thereby reducing their availability. The absence of copper prevents proper assembly and function of mitochondrial complex IV (CIV), hindering mitochondrial metabolism; the lack of glucose cuts off glycolysis and leads to a tumor specific starvation. Meanwhile, the reactions catalyzed by HPP/TPEN@GC contribute to the generation of Fenton-like catalysts and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can further react to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (·OH) for CDT. Taken together, the multifunctional cascade nanoreactor reduces the availability of endogenous copper and glucose, and further takes advantage of them to generate ·OH for cascade starvation-chemodynamic therapy. Collectively, this work represents a distinctive therapeutic paradigm to harness endogenous copper and glucose, which should inspire further studies to take full advantage of endogenous nutrients to combat various diseases, including tumors."

This study aims to investigate the effects of combined freeze-thaw and Cu stress on the physiological characteristics of rye seedlings and to assess the potential of exogenous GABA in mitigating these effects. The results indicated that root length, shoot length, fresh weight, and dry weight of rye seedlings were significantly reduced under combined stress, indicating synergistic inhibition. Combined stress impaired photosynthesis, increased MDA and H2O2 levels, and reduced endogenous GABA, thereby exacerbating physiological damage in rye seedlings. Treatment with exogenous GABA effectively alleviated growth inhibition and enhanced photosynthesis. Furthermore, exogenous GABA underscores its role in adaptation to combined stress by increasing soluble protein content, activating the antioxidant system, regulating GABA metabolism, and enhancing metal detoxification capacity, thereby improving stress tolerance. This finding not only contributes to enhancing the stability of grassland ecosystems but also provides a theoretical foundation for the future application of GABA in agricultural production, particularly in crop protection under environmental pollution and extreme climatic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Current anti-tumor strategies majorly rely on the targeted delivery of functional nanomedicines to tumor region, neglecting the importance of effective infiltration of these nanomedicines in whole tumor tissue. This process normally causes the quick endocytosis by the tumor cells at surface layer of tumor tissue, resulting in the restriction of the penetration of these nanomedicines and limited therapeutic region, which would not be able to treat the entire tumor tissue. Herein, we prepared a series of engineered gold nanoparticles (Au-MBP NPs) with step-wise charge reversal in different acid environments that could entirely infiltrate into the whole tumor tissue and then perform tumor-specific photothermal-chemodynamic-immunotherapy to achieve the complete and accurate tumor treatment. These Au-MBP NPs consisted of AuNPs, thiol modified piperidine (SH-PD, charge reversal group), thiol modified benzoyl thiourea (SH-BTU, copper chelator) and 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) with different proportions. Once these Au-MBP NPs arrived tumor tissue, the decreasing pH values from shallow to deep region of tumor tissue separately induced the charge reversal of these nanoparticles from negative to positive, allowing them to bind with negatively charged tumor cells at designed area to occupy the whole tumor for further therapy. Following with the internalization by tumor cells, these Au-MBP NPs would selectively capture the excessive Cu2+ to decrease the available copper in tumor cells, resulting in the inhibition of tumor metastasis via the copper metabolism blockade. On one hand, the captured Cu2+ also induced the aggregation of Au-MBP NPs, which in situ generated the photothermal agents in tumor cells for tumor-specific photothermal therapy (PTT). On the other hand, the chelated Cu2+ ions were reduced to Cu+, which catalyzed the high concentration of intracellular H2O2 to produce cytotoxic hydroxyl radical (•OH), exerting tumor-specific chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Furthermore, the immune-associated tumor antigens were also generated during PTT and CDT processes via immunogenic cell death (ICD), which further matured the dendritic cells (DCs) and then activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to turn on the immunotherapy, resulting in additional anti-tumor and anti-metastasis effects. Both in vitro and in vivo results indicated that these Au-MBP NPs possessed enormous potential for effectively suppressing primary and metastatic tumors."

Fifteen lambs with similar body weight (16 ± 1.53 kg) were assigned to three groups: a control group (T1) receiving a basal diet, and two treatment groups (T2 and T3) supplemented with 0.5 g and 1 g of organic copper per kg DM, respectively. The total dietary copper concentrations were 6.18, 81.68 and 156.75 ppm in T1, T2, and T3 groups, respectively. The basal diet, composed of soybeans, wheat, and barley, provided 2.4 Mcal/kg metabolizable energy and 14% crude protein. High dietary copper supplementation had no significant impact on growth performance and body biometric measurements. Testicular length was increased in T3 lambs. Mineral analysis showed increased hepatic copper concentrations in T2 and T3 lambs. Kidney copper levels remained within normal ranges, while renal zinc concentrations declined in T2 and T3 lambs. Gene expression analysis demonstrated upregulation of ATP7A and ATP7B genes in T3 lambs, indicating a cellular adaptation to elevated copper levels, while IGF1 expression remained unchanged. Histological assessments, however, revealed hepatic and renal changes in T3 lambs. Overall, high dietary organic copper supplementation, particularly at 1 g Cu/kg DM, increases copper retention and may support reproductive health in Awassi lambs. However, excessive intake poses risks of liver and kidney damage, highlighting the need for careful dietary management."

      "abstract": "Nitrate (NO3-) and Cu2+ are common water pollutants that were frequently detected in varied waters such as metallurgical wastewater, electronic wastewater, etc. It is challenging to achieve simultaneous removal of NO3- and Cu2+. Herein, we prepared varied Pd/TiO2 catalysts for the catalytic hydrogenation reduction of Cu2+ and NO3-, and found that single Cu2+ could be effectively reduced (100 %) within 15 min, while the removal of NO3- was ignorant. Interestingly, the catalytic reduction of NO3- was triggered rapidly with the presence of Cu2+, where Cu2+ was still efficiently removed. The detected NO3- reduction intermediate products were NO2-, NH4+ and N2, and the selectivity for N2 and NH4+ in the final products were 27 % and 73 %, respectively, reflecting a synergistic treatment of multiple pollutants with clean products. The active H generated on the Pd active sites and newly formed Cu species played vital roles for the reduction of Cu2+ and NO3-, respectively. The low valence Cu was regenerated by the appearance of active H and cyclically joined NO3- reduction. Conventional technologies for NO3- removal are often inhibited or compromised in the presence of Cu2+, whereas this study circumvents these limitations and achieves efficient simultaneous removal of both Cu2+ and NO3-, with negligible generation of the byproduct NO2-. This study provided a new pathway to simultaneously catalytic eliminate heavy metal and NO3- and insights into the promote effect of coexisted Cu2+ for NO3- elimination.",

      "abstract": "Cuproptosis is a currently discovered programmed cell death modality driven by copper (Cu) ions, which shows potential application prospects in overcoming apoptotic resistance in cancer therapy due to its unique mechanism. Nevertheless, the efficiency of cuproptosis is restricted by strict Cu metabolism regulation. Herein, elesclomol (ES) and glucose oxidase (GOx) co-loaded CuFe2O4 (CF) nanoplatform (termed as CFEG) was elaborately engineered to boost cuproptosis through multi-pathway copper metabolisms regulation. After triggered by tumor-overexpressed glutathione (GSH), the released ES continuously chelated and targeted transport Cu ions through a shuttle mechanism to mitochondria where cuproptosis was initiated, which dramatically improved the influx efficiency of Cu. Additionally, GOx-mediated glucose oxidation reaction together with Cu and Fe ions stimulated Fenton reaction simultaneously amplified intracellular oxidative pressure by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) self-supply and subsequent hydroxyl radical (•OH) generation, which down-regulated Cu exporter ATP7A expression and inhibited Cu ions efflux, thereby exacerbating cuproptosis. Furthermore, the consumption of GSH simultaneously reduced the chelation of GSH with Cu and promote the •OH generation, further potentiating the occurrence of cuproptosis. Collectively, such the multi-pathway copper metabolisms regulation including improved Cu influx, inhibited Cu efflux and GSH depletion significantly boosted cuproptosis, which synergized with photothermal effect of CF to efficiently repressed the growth of tumor in mice without causing systemic toxicity. This work provides a multivariate mode for enhanced tumor cuproptosis therapy, and may also inspire the design of advanced cuproptosis-related nanomedicine system."

      "abstract": "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a major challenge in oncology due to its highly invasive nature and limited treatment options. GBM's aggressive migration beyond tumor margins and rapid tumor growth hinders success in patient treatment. Localized therapeutic delivery, such as the use of transition metals like copper, is highlighted as a novel therapeutic agent for many potential biomedical applications. Herein, it is aimed to study the effects of Cu release on the proliferation and invasiveness of cancer cells. To this end, novel copper-based nanostructures with different release patterns are designed. Using a complex 3D cell culture model to mimic the tumor microenvironment, it is shown that different patterns of copper ion release have a strong impact on GBM progression and invasiveness. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing localized copper release patterns to tailor different tumor treatment strategies. They also show the potential and suitability of 3D microchips as instruments to study the behavior of tumor spheroids. In spite of their limitations, these 3D microdevices enable a controlled and close monitoring of the influence of environmental factors (such as the presence of Cu ions) on the proliferation and invasiveness of the cells, with a better approach to reality compared to 2D models and with a more controlled environment, compared to an in vivo model."

      "abstract": "Cancer cells often develop tolerance to chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy drugs either before or during treatment. The significant heterogeneity among various tumors poses a critical challenge in modern cancer research, particularly in overcoming drug resistance. Copper, as an essential trace element in the body, participates in various biological processes of diseases, including cancers. The growth of many types of tumor cells exhibits a heightened dependence on copper. Thus, targeting copper metabolism or inducing cuproptosis may be potential ways to overcome cancer drug resistance. Copper chelators have shown potential in overcoming cancer drug resistance by targeting copper-dependent processes in cancer cells. In contrast, copper ionophores, copper-based nanomaterials, and other small molecules have been used to induce copper-dependent cell death (cuproptosis) in cancer cells, including drug-resistant tumor cells. This review summarizes the regulation of copper metabolism and cuproptosis in cancer cells and the role of copper metabolism and cuproptosis in cancer drug resistance, providing ideas for overcoming cancer resistance in the future."

      "abstract": "Mixed exposure to trace metals (such as manganese, iron, and copper) may cause significant damage to the nervous system, potentially leading to neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper on PC12 cells and its mechanisms, and to evaluate the therapeutic effects of sodium para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS-Na). We employed various experimental techniques, including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assays), flow cytometry, and western blotting, to systematically analyze cell viability, redox homeostasis, copper ions concentration, and the expression of cuproptosis-related proteins. The results showed that mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper significantly reduced the viability of PC12 cells, and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and copper ions concentration. At the same time, Glutathione (GSH) levels significantly decreased, indicating that the cells were affected by oxidative stress. Further analysis revealed that the increased copper ions concentration was closely related to the upregulation of CTR1 protein expression and the downregulation of ATP7 A protein expression, suggesting a link between copper ions accumulation and the ensuing cell death. Notably, PAS-Na treatment significantly restored cell viability and reversed the increase in copper ions concentration and oxidative stress caused by mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper. PAS-Na also reversed the expression of cuproptosis-related proteins, indicating its potential for neuroprotection. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of trace metal-induced cell damage and lay the groundwork for the future development of related drugs and therapeutic strategies, warranting further exploration of PAS-Na's clinical efficacy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diagnosing Wilson disease (WD) remains challenging. The exchangeable copper (CuEXC) methodology measures the non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper fraction in serum. Relative exchangeable copper (REC), the ratio of CuEXC to total serum copper (Total Cu), has been proposed as a potential diagnostic biomarker. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these three copper biomarkers in WD. METHODS: CuEXC and Total Cu levels were measured in newly diagnosed treatment-naïve patients with WD (n = 13), treated WD (n = 91), non-Wilsonian hepatic disease (n = 206) and non-Wilsonian acute liver failure (n = 22). REC, CuEXC and Total Cu were compared among groups. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Median REC was significantly elevated among patients with WD compared to all other groups combined (23.6% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001). The opposite was found for Total Cu (3.5 μmol/L vs. 17.2 μmol/L, p < 0.001). In newly diagnosed patients with WD, median REC was significantly higher than in treated patients (29.1% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.008). The optimal diagnostic cut-off value for REC was ≥ 13.8% (sensitivity 100% and specificity 99.6%) for newly diagnosed patients versus those with non-Wilsonian hepatic disease. For Total Cu, the optimal cut-off was ≤ 7.1 μmol/L (sensitivity 61.5% and specificity 99.1%) for newly diagnosed patients with WD versus those with non-Wilsonian hepatic disease. CONCLUSION: Our data support the diagnostic value of REC in WD. The more broadly available Total Cu also demonstrates a strong diagnostic performance and may be useful in initial work-up. We suggest including REC and/or Total Cu in a future revision of the Leipzig score.",

While chemiresistive sensors are well suited for this purpose, traditional metal oxides typically require high operating temperatures (>100 °C) or external stimuli (e.g., UV light) for activation. In this work, we introduce two-dimensional (2D) copper oxysulfide nanoflakes (∼10 nm thick) as a novel material for room-temperature, reversible, and selective H2S sensing. These 2D copper oxysulfides, synthesized via the calcination of copper sulfide under both oxygen-deficient and oxygen-rich conditions, show significant changes in crystal structure and electronic band properties compared to copper sulfide while retaining p-type semiconducting behavior. This alteration enables efficient interfacial charge transfer with adsorbed H2S molecules. The oxygen-rich copper oxysulfide exhibits a response magnitude of 143% for 2 ppm of H2S in air at room temperature, with a linear response across concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2 ppm. Furthermore, the sensor demonstrates complete reversibility, excellent selectivity, and high stability. This work presents a promising strategy for high-performance room-temperature H2S sensing utilizing metal oxysulfides as an emerging class of materials derived from metal oxides and sulfides.",

      "abstract": "Copper (Cu) contamination has emerged a global public health problem due to the extensive use of Cu in industrial production and daily life. Reproductive damage resulting from Cu exposure has been particularly evident. Wilson's disease (WD) is a recessive genetic disease characterized by impaired Cu metabolism. Female WD patients have often been associated with reproductive impairment. Ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent regulated cell death, has been identified as being caused by massive lipid peroxide-mediated membrane damage. However, it remains unclear whether ferroptosis is associated with Cu-induced ovarian damage. In this study, the role of ferroptosis in ovarian damage induced by Cu accumulation and its underlying mechanisms were examined through both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The findings indicated that excessive Cu deposition in the ovaries could lead to follicular atresia and ovulation dysfunction, and trigger ferroptosis in ovarian and granulosa cells (GCs). The mechanism may be related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediated by the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway, and hyperactivation of autophagy. In addition, Cu-induced autophagy in GCs was found to increase intracellular iron levels via the ferritinophagy pathway, thereby inducing ferroptosis. We also found that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (MitoROS) may be an onstream facilitator of Cu-induced ferroptosis via activation of the ER stress-autophagy pathway. Our findings suggested that ferroptosis is associated with Cu-induced ovarian damage and is regulated by the MitoROS-ER stress-autophagy axes. These results might provide insights for developing treatment for WD and other diseases related to Cu exposure."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the most common primary malignant bone tumor, further investigation into risk stratification for osteosarcoma (OS) prognosis is of significant clinical importance. Copper is essential for bone metabolism; however, its specific role in OS remains unclear. METHODS: The expression characteristics of copper metabolism related genes (CORGs) in OS were revealed by single cell sequencing. Prognosis-associated CORGs were identified, and a CORG-related scoring system and risk model were established using bioinformatics approaches, including univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses and LASSO analysis. We further analyzed immune microenvironment infiltration, molecular subtypes and clinicopathological characteristics. The impact of selected CORG with high-risk coefficient on OS cells was tested by qRT-PCR, western blot, siRNA, colony formation analysis and Transwell in vitro. RESULTS: We successfully developed an OS scoring system related to copper metabolism and validated its independent prognostic value in patients with OS. The potential clinical value of CORG scoring system was analyzed. APOA4 was selected for in vitro experiments and its effect on the proliferation and invasion ability of OS cells was verified. CONCLUSION: We established a copper metabolism-related scoring system to effectively stratify the risk of OS patients. Our results provide a new basis for the role of copper metabolism in OS and provide new potential targets for the treatment of OS."

This study presents a nanobiomimetic hollow copper-sulfide (HCuS) platform for precise homotypic tumor targeting and melanoma treatment. The HCuS@OVA@CM (COC) nanoplatform-encapsulated ovalbumin (OVA) antigen protein within HCuS nanoparticles and was coated with melanoma cell membranes (B16F10). Importantly, this design facilitates specific tumor accumulation and achieves 16.0% photothermal conversion efficiency under 1064 nm NIR-II irradiation, which is a key factor for therapeutic success. In vitro studies have demonstrated that this nanoplatform induces immunogenic cell death (ICD), enhances antigen presentation, and stimulates dendritic cell (DCs) maturation. In vivo experiments confirmed that COC-mediated NIR-II photothermal treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth without notable body weight loss. This biomimetic nanoplatform approach offers a targeted, enhanced, and effective immune response for tumor photothermal immunotherapy, making it a promising candidate for advanced melanoma treatment and anticancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Nitroxoline (NIT) has been approved for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) for more than half a century, yet its antimicrobial properties remain incompletely understood. Here, we determined the intricate connections between NIT's metal-chelating capabilities and its antibacterial activity. Metal ion binding characteristics were measured by Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Biochemical assays and molecular docking studies were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. We found that NIT could interact with a diverse array of metal ions, including Cu2+, Fe2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+. While, the addition of Cu2+ significantly decreased NIT's antibacterial effect against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strain J96 and multidrug resistant E coli B2, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) increased from 8 mg/L to 64 mg/L. Mechanically, NIT significantly decreased the intracellular copper ion levels and reduced bacterial transmembrane electrical potential. Furthermore, NIT promoted production of nitric oxide, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the interaction of Cu2+ with NIT suppressed the induced generation of ROS but not the generation of ONOO- in E coli, suggesting that the antibacterial activity of NIT arose from multiple functional groups within its molecular structure. Moreover, NIT triggered intracellular acidification concomitant with enhanced glucose uptake, yet paradoxically suppressed ATP generation, suggesting a potential uncoupling between glycolytic flux and oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, the action of NIT was predicted to bind to the CuB-metal redox centers of cytochrome bo(3) ubiquinol oxidase through molecular docking analyses. Collectively, these data illuminate the antibacterial activity of NIT as a potent copper-related metalloantibiotic against UPEC.",

Knowing the relative importance of these routes is critical to understand how metals enter and move through aquatic food webs. We previously established that nymphs of the aquatic dragonfly Erythemis simplicicollis accumulate elevated copper (Cu) concentrations when living in contaminated wetlands, but the route of uptake was not identified. In this study, we evaluate copper accumulation with a model two-trophic-level laboratory food chain comprised of E. simplicicollis dragonfly nymphs as predators and Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae as prey to gain better insight into Cu accumulation dynamics in these aquatic insect predators. Treatments consisted of dragonfly nymphs exposed to copper through diet (A. aegypti larvae prey exposed to 100 µg/L Cu-contaminated water), water (100 µg/L Cu), diet + water, and a control. Each treatment included 15 replicates, and 10 pretreatment nymphs were analyzed. Exposures lasted 32 days or until nymph death. Copper accumulation in nymphs and nymph mortality was compared among treatments. Eating contaminated prey did not elevate copper concentrations in E. simplicicollis. In contrast, highest copper concentrations accumulated in E. simplicicollis when exposed to contaminated water, in both the water-only and in the diet + water treatments. Additionally, mortality was greater when exposed to copper-contaminated water. Even though the nymphs did not trophically accumulate Cu, direct uptake of Cu from water provides a point of Cu entry into a food chain.",

Herein, we report the design and fabrication of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based dual Z-Scheme heterojunction for effective photocatalytic degradation of various refractory pollutants in wastewater. Firstly, we synthesized boron-doped g-C3N4 via the direct calcination of melamine along with boric acid, and then coupled with Copper Oxide (CuO) and MXene via the wet-chemical method to fabricate dual Z-scheme CuO/BCN/MXene composite. The physicochemical features of the as-prepared CuO/BCN/MXene composite and reference samples were investigated via various characterization techniques. The photocatalytic degradation performance and the kinetics study for malachite green was evaluated using the as-fabricated dual Z-scheme composite and the coupling components. The CuO/BCN/MXene composite revealed exceptional photocatalytic performance by achieving 98.3 % degradation for malachite green, which is remarkably higher than the reference samples. The enhanced performance was attributed to the band gap narrowing, extended light absorption, and improved charge carrier separation. This study will provide new insights into the design and fabrication of functional nanomaterials for efficient photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and other applications."

However, their inherent instability has hindered kinetic assessments and limited further applications. This study developed a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model for predicting the pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) of high-valent copper species Cu(III) with typical emerging contaminants (ECs). The optimal model was logkobs = 0.002×PSA - 10.1465 × q(C-)X - 4.5896 × ELUMO - 2.0116. R2adj (0.822), Q2LOO (0.784), and Q2ext (0.951) shown the model's robust and great predictive ability. Polar surface area (PSA), Hirshfeld charge on carbon atoms (q(C-)X), and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) synergistically controlled the reactivity of Cu(III). A larger PSA was conducive to the diffusion of ECs in aquatic environments. Additionally, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a smaller q(C-)X could increase the nucleophilic sites of ECs, thereby enhancing the electrophilic reaction of Cu(III). And a lower ELUMO was beneficial for adjusting the energy gap (EGAP) to enhance the reactivity of ECs. This study filled the gap in the prediction of kobs for Cu(III) and provided a reliable reference for the selective treatment of different ECs by HVMS."

      "abstract": "Patients afflicted with Wilson's disease (WD) may encounter hepatic and extraneous manifestations due to the progressive accumulation of copper in the liver and other subsequent organs. Copper-chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine (DPA), are commonly utilized in the medical treatment of copper overload in WD. Manipulating the composition of gut microbiota appropriately can enhance drug efficacy and safety. This study aims to investigate how targeted intervention on gut microbiota influences the effectiveness of copper removal in a WD model during DPA treatment. First, following a 4-week treatment of DPA, the liver copper concentration and gut microbial composition were assessed in the WD mice model to identify potential candidates for targeted regulation of gut microbiota. Second, after 8 weeks of manipulating the gut microbiota during DPA treatment, various parameters including blood liver function indicators, tissue copper load, hepatic histopathological features, and gut microbiota were investigated in WD mice. The findings demonstrated that the presence of Akkermansia significantly enhances the efficacy of DPA, leading to a more efficient elimination of copper from tissues and a greater improvement in liver injury, liver dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis. In contrast, Butyricimonas has an antagonistic effect. The results of gene function prediction analysis indicated that the altered gut microbial function by DPA and Akk is primarily linked to energy generation/utilization, amino acid, fatty acid, lipid, and nucleic acid metabolisms. To summarize, this study provides experimental evidence for the potential application of targeted regulation of gut microbiota in the adjunctive therapy of copper dysregulation disease.IMPORTANCECopper is an essential element in virtually all living organisms. Wilson's disease (WD) is a representative disorder caused by the disruption of copper homeostasis. Oral-chelating agents are the first-line treatment for copper-overloaded diseases, with D-penicillamine (DPA) being the prototypical drug. However, the efficacy and adverse effects of DPA remain challenging in its use for WD treatment. In our study, the supplementation of Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk), a key gut microbe, along with DPA was demonstrated to enhance copper removal, ameliorate liver injury and dysfunction, and restore gut dysbiosis in a mouse model of WD. These findings highlight the significant potential applications of targeted modulation of gut microbiota as \"pharmacomicrobiomics\" in adjunctive therapy for disorders involving copper dysregulation."

The composite ECH@Cu-CSSB was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In addition, it was subsequently utilized for the methyl orange (MO) dye removal from aqueous solutions using a batch technique. The effect of various parameters such as pH solution, adsorbent dose, shaking time, temperature, and initial dye solution was studied. The adsorption initial pH, initial MO concentration, and temperature show a negative impact on MO removal percentage. At the same time, the adsorption contacts time and adsorbent doses have a positive effect. The maximum MO removal efficiency of the ECH@Cu-CSSB was found to be 99.4 % at initial pH of 2, adsorbent dose of 0.02 g, initial concentration of 40 mg/L, contact time of 90 min, and temperature of 25 °C. The kinetic and isotherm models were applied using experimental data and the result confirmed that the results fitted well with the pseudo-second-order and Temkin isotherm models. Therefore, different electrostatic attractions, H-bonding, Yoshida H-bonding, π-π, and n-π stacking are the main reasons for the adsorption of MO dye onto ECH@Cu-CSSB. The results of this work revealed that the as-prepared composite ECH@Cu-CSSB showed great potential as a good efficient adsorbent for MO uptake dye and can be used for other organic dyes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that copper has the ability to promote the progressive development of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is believed to play a crucial role in this process. Scutellarin, a flavonoid compound, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and neuroprotective effects. AIM: We investigated the effect of scutellarin on copper-induced inflammatory foam cell formation in microglia. METHODS: We exposed BV2 murine microglial cells to copper, then collected the conditioned medium and co-cultured it with MO3.13 human glial cells to mimic myelin damage in vitro. The Cell Counting kit-8 assay, quantitative (polymerase chain reaction) PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Luxol fast blue staining, and western blotting were used to detect the cell phenotype. To investigate whether exposure of BV2 cells to copper can cause neurotoxicity and indirect damage to myelin cells, we determined whether BV2 cells promote inflammation through foam cell formation by oil red O staining and detection of malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Finally, we treated cells with scutellarin to investigate its therapeutic effects. RESULTS: Exposure to copper activated the pro-inflammatory phenotype of microglia, as assessed by measuring the transcription of M1/M2-related biomarkers. In addition, increased copper intake by microglia promoted intracellular lipid accumulation and oxidation, facilitating foam cell formation. Rescue experiments showed that copper chelator ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM) and the lipid oxidation inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) significantly inhibited copper-induced inflammation, reduced intracellular lipid accumulation and MDA levels, and decreased foam cell formation. Moreover, copper-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in microglia led to a shift towards the M1 phenotype and foam cell transformation, which were effectively inhibited by ATTM, Fer-1, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Lastly, after treatment with scutellarin, copper-induced foam microglia exhibited inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation, increased production of neurotrophic factors, decreased expression of inflammatory mediators, reduced lipid accumulation, and induced polarization towards the M2 phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrated that copper can induce microglia to damage myelinating cells, with the key mechanism involving the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Scutellarin partially reversed the positive effects of copper on promoting microglial M1 polarization, lipid deposition, and lipid oxidation by mediating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that scutellarin may be a promising drug for the treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

The supernatant of the acid-extracted product was separated from the residues through centrifugation. To ensure cost efficiency, the supernatant was treated with 2N acetic acid for 24 h, with the addition of hydrogen peroxide, and used for the biosorption experiments. The filtrated supernatant was adjusted to various pH values (4.5, 5.0, and 5.5) to explore the effects of acidity on the subsequent biosorption of extracted zinc and copper by baker's yeast. A diluted molasses solution was added to the filtrate as a carbon source to support yeast growth during the 4 h biosorption experiments. The results revealed that the removal efficiency of zinc from the filtrate by baker's yeast was 97.3%, while the removal efficiency for copper was about 48.8% at pH 5.5 with a reaction time of 4 h. In summary, this combined approach is expected to reduce and recycle heavy metals in livestock sludge. Acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide can extract copper and zinc from the sludge, and baker's yeast can absorb both metals from the filtrate at pH 5.5 in a 4 h reaction time. This technological innovation has the potential to transform waste management practices in the livestock industry, contributing to resource recovery and environmental sustainability."

We propose a \"dual metabolic interference\" strategy to amplify cuproptosis by synergistically targeting iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins and suppressing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). A TME-responsive nanoplatform (ACH NPs) was constructed based on a copper-shikonin coordination network (CuSK), the OXPHOS inhibitor atovaquone (ATO), and hyaluronic acid (HA). Upon GSH/acid-triggered release, Cu+/Cu2+ and ATO/SK synergistically induced irreversible damage: (1) Copper overload induces dihydrolipoamide transacetylase (DLAT) aggregation and irreversible Fe-S cluster loss, directly disrupting mitochondrial complexes I-III functions; (2) ATO further suppresses complex III activity, reducing oxygen consumption and blocking ATP synthesis to exacerbate metabolic crisis; (3) Concurrently, Cu+-catalyzed Fenton-like reactions synergize with SK-driven oxidative stress to generate •OH radicals, activating Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. In vivo experiments verified that this dual metabolic interference strategy effectively inhibited tumor growth (86.8% tumor suppression). These findings not only expand the theoretical boundaries of cuproptosis but also establish a promising paradigm for cancer therapy through coordinated targeting of metal homeostasis and metabolic vulnerabilities.",

In this study, variations in the transcriptome and metabolomics of the leaves of plants exposed to various concentrations of copper ions (Cu2+) for 7 d were analyzed. Several crucial metabolic pathways involved in leaf defense against Cu2+ exposure were identified using integrative transcriptome and metabolome analysis. The pathways for plants coping with Cu2+ exposure were associated with carotenoid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis, plant hormonal signal transduction, phenylpropanoid and terpenoid metabolisms. In the 90.0 μM Cu2+ treatment, abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase was upregulated, reducing abscisic acid content, while downregulation of the BAK1 gene and pathogen-related protein genes triggered programmed cell death The positive role of antheraxanthin, γ-L-glutamylcysteine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and carnosine in the plant defense against 45.0 μM Cu2+ was observed. Lutein, 3,4-dihydrospheroidene, linoleic acid, glutamine, pyroglutamic acid, the gene encoding brassinosteroid resistant 1/2, and xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase are involved in plant defense against 90.0 μM Cu2+. Compared to 0 mM, both Cu2+ treatments upregulated hexadecanedioic acid abundance and the gene encoding the auxin response protein. This study provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms through which invasive plants defend against PTE exposure."

However, current cGAS-STING inhibitors as immunosuppressants suffer from instability, non-specific targeting, and innate immune disruption. Here, an endogenous AD brain copper ion-responsive covalent organic framework (COF)-based nanozyme (denoted as TP@PB-COF@NADH) has been designed for targeted inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway for AD treatment. The effective trapping of excess brain endogenous copper ions by TP@PB-COF@NADH not only inhibits the Cu2+-induced harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which is one of the mediators of cGAS-STING activation, but also activates the nanozyme activity of TP@PB-COF@NADH. Furthermore, the well-prepared nanozyme catalytically generates NAD+ and consumes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through second near-infrared (NIR-II) enhanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) peroxidase (NPX)-like activity, realizing the efficient inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway and associated neuroinflammation. Moreover, replenishing NAD+ levels efficiently restores mitochondrial function and ATP supply. In vivo studies demonstrate that TP@PB-COF@NADH with NIR-II irradiation significantly improves cognitive function in 3× Tg-AD mice, with a reduction in amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Collectively, this work presents a promising approach for AD treatment by using an AD brain harmful excess endogenous copper ion-responsive and efficient nanozyme."

      "abstract": "Copper is a trace element indispensable for cellular physiology, integral to cellular redox balance, and a constituent of enzyme active sites, thereby playing a pivotal role in cellular physiological function. Concerning the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the homeostatic balance of copper is perturbed both intracellularly and extracellularly. The copper-amyloid precursor protein (APP) complex facilitates the efflux of copper from cells, leading to intracellular copper depletion. Concurrently, extracellular copper associates with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, precipitating copper-enriched Aβ deposition and augmenting reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain tissue, which finally culminates in oxidative brain damage. The interaction between copper and APP enhances the α-secretase pathway of APP processing while suppressing the β-secretase pathway, resulting in an increased production of soluble APP (sAPP), which contributes to neuroinflammation in the brain tissue. Utilizing the affinity of copper for Aβ plaques, the application of chelating agents to sequester copper within the brain can mitigate neurodegeneration associated with AD pathology. Furthermore, the use of metal imaging techniques to detect copper in the brain offers a potential diagnostic tool for the early identification of AD."

To overcome these limitations, the development of biomimetic nanozymes is gaining momentum. Nevertheless, developing multifunctional nanozymes with high laccase-like activity poses several challenges. This study focused on optimizing the synthesis of imidazole-copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (I-Cu) nanozymes and characterizing its physicochemical properties. Key synthesis parameters (precursor amount, incubation time, and oven temperature) were optimized. I-Cu nanozymes were synthesized in a Teflon-lined autoclave via water-induced precipitation of Cu2+ and imidazole, mimicking the N-Cu coordination found in laccase's active sites. Initial screenings revealed the superior catalytic activity of I-Cu nanozymes synthesized using methanol compared to ethanol, and a smaller nano-scale size than laccase. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of similar chemical components as laccase (C44H69N11O20), verifying I-Cu nanozyme's capability to degrade phenolic compounds, and imidazole did not decompose throughout the synthesis process. The optimized I-Cu nanozyme demonstrated higher catalytic activity (6.569 UA), oxidation efficiency (Vmax of 0.00893 mM/min and Km of 2.4020 mM), and greater stability under varying pH, temperature, and storage conditions, compared to laccase. Conclusively, the optimized I-Cu nanozyme, with a 6.00-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to previous studies, as well as 1.69-fold higher Km, and 2.08-fold higher Vmax compared to laccase, shows promise as a wastewater treatment alternative. Its enhanced performance, achieved with fewer precursors through synthesis optimization, highlights the potential of lesser-known biomimetic nanozymes and underscores the importance of refining the synthesis parameters."

To inhibit the generation of AMD from copper sulfide tailings at the source, in this paper, a strategy is developed for promoting the biopassivation of copper sulfide tailings using algal biochar, and the effects of the pyrolysis temperature and concentration of algal biochar on the passivation efficiency and stability are investigated. The results reveal that the introduction of algal biochar during the biopassivation of copper sulfide tailings significantly enhances the tailings passivation effect of the tested Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strain and greatly stabilizes the formed passivation layer. Algal biochar prepared with a pyrolysis temperature of 300 °C and applied at a concentration of 6 g/L not only optimizes biopassivation but also significantly improves the stability of the passivation layer. The complex mechanisms of algal biochar in this system include regulating the pH and oxidation‒reduction potential of the reaction system, effectively adsorbing microbial cells, efficiently aggregating metal cations in solution, stimulating the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances, and accelerating electron transfer. This research offers a novel method for the benign treatment of copper sulfide tailings and resource utilization of algae."

This study investigates the inhibitory effects of silver and copper oxide nanoparticles, synthesized using Juglans regia green husk aqueous extract, on human insulin fibrillation. Initially, the formation of amyloid fibrils in recombinant human insulin protein was examined under various buffers and by altering physicochemical conditions, such as pH and temperature, identifying optimal conditions for fibril formation. The nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized for size using dynamic light scattering (DLS), morphology via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and surface charge through zeta potential analysis. Utilizing biochemical and biophysical techniques, including turbidimetry, DLS, SEM, and fluorescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that both nanoparticle types effectively inhibit insulin fibrillation, with copper nanoparticles exhibiting superior efficacy. Bioinformatics analyses, combined with zeta potential measurements, suggest that the inhibitory effects of the nanoparticles arise from interactions with charged regions of the insulin molecule. These findings highlight the critical role of nanoparticle characteristics in modulating protein aggregation and present promising therapeutic potential for addressing amyloid-related diseases. Future research should aim to optimize nanoparticle design and evaluate their pharmacokinetics to improve their clinical applicability."

However, its therapeutic performance is compromised by the strictly regulated copper metabolism and highly expressed intracellular glutathione (GSH). Herein, an intelligent nanoplatform (NSeMON-P@CuT/LipD) is rationally developed as a copper metabolic disrupter, GSH consumer, and Fenton-like reaction trigger for cancer cuproptosis/ferroptosis/apoptosis therapy. NSeMON-P@CuT/LipD is constructed from the preparation of diselenide-bridged mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles, and then pemetrexed (Pem) is loaded followed by surface deposition with a Cu2+-3,3'-dithiobis(propionohydrazide) (TPH) coordinated network and coating with a diclofenac (DC)-encapsulated liposome. In response to the specific tumor microenvironment, the obtained NSeMON-P@CuT/LipD can release DC, Cu2+, and Pem and simultaneously amplify cellular oxidative stress by consuming GSH and catalyzing endogenous H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Both liberated DC and augmented oxidative stress can inhibit glycolysis, reduce ATP level, and then block copper transporter ATP7B, resulting in metabolic disorders and the high retention of copper in cells for •OH generation. Moreover, the overloaded copper can promote dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase oligomerization and Fe-S cluster protein loss, thus evoking cuproptosis. Collectively, the augmented oxidative stress activates prominent ferroptosis, which cooperates with cuproptosis and Pem-mediated apoptosis to significantly inhibit the tumor growth of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. This study demonstrates feasible strategies to enhance tumor cuproptosis using a single nanoplatform and may also inspire the design of advanced cuproptosis-related therapies.",

Cuproptosis, an emerging therapeutic modality, is a promising strategic intervention for treating TNBC. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of cuproptosis is compromised by tumor adaptations, including the Warburg effect, increased intracellular glutathione (GSH), and copper efflux, thus breaking the barrier of cuproptosis is the basis for developing cuproptosis-based clinical therapies. Herein, a self-accelerating strategy utilizing a pH-responsive copper framework encapsulating glucose oxidase (GOx), modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and tumor-penetrating peptide (tLyp1) has been developed. Upon reaching the acidic tumor microenvironment, the released GOx increases intracellular acidity and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The elevated intracellular GSH and H2O2 serve as \"fuel\" to amplify the copper-based catalytic within tumor cells. Concurrently, the reduction of copper efflux proteins (ATP7B) and the depletion of GSH lead to copper overload in tumor cells, leading to cuproptosis via copper overload, mitochondrial disruption, and Fe-S protein instability. This constellation of interrelated events constitutes a potent \"Copper Bomb,\" which concurrently triggers the immune system and effectively kills the tumor. It robustly engages innate and adaptive immunity via the release of mitochondrial DNA, facilitating the cGAS-STING pathway and precipitating immunogenic cell death. This process reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, eliminates tumor cells, and suppresses metastasis, thus offering a novel therapeutic modality for the comprehensive treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)."

However, the therapeutic efficacy of CDT as a monotherapy is often limited by an insufficient level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) within tumor cells. Because of the high copper content in tumor tissues, a copper ionophore was strategically employed to enhance the intracellular accumulation of copper, thereby potentiating the CDT effect. Additionally, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to modify the copper ionophore, naphthazarin (Nap), to promote its targeting efficacy for tumor cells and to ensure its biosafety. The BSA-coated Nap nanoparticles, which could recruit Cu2+ in situ, were further deposited onto the surface of a manganese carbonate nanocube (Nap-BM NPs). The synergistic action of copper and manganese ions accelerated the decomposition of H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and consumed intracellular GSH, leading to cellular mortality via mitochondrial pathways. With low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility in normal cells, the developed Nap-BM NPs significantly enhanced therapeutic outcomes by leveraging multiple Fenton-like reaction mechanisms to augment CDT, offering promising potential for clinical applications and contributing valuable insights into the field.",

To address this, we report on the use of a Cu-MOF (copper metal-organic framework) protective layer to regulate the biodegradation of copper-based nanomaterials. In situ formation of Cu-MOF on Cu2O nanocubes not only stabilizes the material under physiological conditions but also enhances its sonodynamic therapy (SDT) capabilities by establishing a Z-Scheme heterojunction. Upon SDT activation, the targeted Cu ion release at the tumor site triggers a cascade of reactions, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) via Fenton-like processes and depleting glutathione (GSH). This ROS surge, combined with effective cuproptosis, modulates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing immunogenic cell death to eliminate primary tumors and inhibit metastasis. This study offers a new paradigm for the controlled integration of SDT, chemodynamic therapy (CDT), cuproptosis, and immunotherapy, achieving precise tumor-targeted treatment via controlled copper nanomaterial degradation.",

      "abstract": "Hypoxia is a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment, leading to metabolic reprogramming and therapeutic resistance. The enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) supports hypoxia adaptation, making it an attractive target for cancer treatment. Copper-64 diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM) exhibits selective hypoxia uptake, positioning it as a promising theranostic agent for imaging and treating hypoxic tumors. In this study, we employed molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate the binding, stability, and dynamic behavior of 64Cu-ATSM within the MTHFD2 active site. Docking analysis revealed strong binding affinity (ΔGbind = -7.91 kcal/mol) with stable hydrogen bonding to key residues. MD simulations, assessed via root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), radial distribution function (RDF), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), dynamic cross-correlation maps (DCCM), and 2D principal component analysis (2D-PCA), confirmed ligand stability. MM-PBSA and per-residue decomposition analyses identified ARG43, TYR84, ASN87, LYS88, GLN132, GLY310, GLY313, and PRO314 as key contributors to ligand stabilization. These findings support 64Cu-ATSM as a potential MTHFD2-targeting theranostic agent. However, in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate its therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and clinical relevance for hypoxia-selective cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "Studies show that intracellular accumulation of copper ions causes cuproptosis, potentially enhancing anticancer immunity. However, the induction of cuproptosis inevitably faces challenges due to low intracellular copper deliver efficiency and collateral damage to normal tissues. This paper presents a self-amplified cuproptosis nanoplatform (CEL NP) composed of Cu2- XS hollow nanospheres (HNSs), elesclomol (ES), and phase-change material lauric acid (LA). Under NIR-II laser irradiation, the photothermal energy generated by Cu2- XS HNSs melts LA, facilitating the precise release of ES and copper ions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, ES can traverse the cell membrane and form ES-Cu(II) complexes, thereby enhancing copper delivery within tumor cells. Excess Cu(II) also reacts with endogenous glutathione, reducing its inhibitory effect on cuproptosis. Ultimately, this amplified cuproptosis effect can activate immunogenic cell death, eliciting a robust immune response and promoting tumor suppression. The CEL NP-mediated release of ES and copper ions offers a novel approach for anticancer therapy through cuproptosis induction."

      "abstract": "Wastewater is a significant source of copper to freshwater environments, which can severely harm aquatic life. The bioavailability and toxicity of copper in water are influenced by its complexation with dissolved organic matter (DOM). Speciation models, like the biotic ligand model (BLM) that guides Cu regulations, assume DOM is dominated by humic substances. Research suggests that anthropogenic compounds in wastewater discharge may be important copper binding ligands, although their identities remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we identified and quantified organic copper species isolated from 24 h composite wastewater samples by solid phase extraction (SPE) using liquid chromatography (LC) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS). Analyses of samples across different stages of treatment revealed the net removal of Cu (73%) and DOC (66%). LC-ICPMS showed that certain complexes were selectively removed, while others evaded removal or were generated during treatment. Relatively hydrophobic complexes decreased in abundance from the initial to the secondary treatment stage. In contrast, more hydrophilic organic Cu complexes, likely formed during treatment, showed a significant increase from the secondary to the tertiary stage. The molecular mass and formula of seven discrete chromatographically resolved complexes were identified by LC-Orbitrap MS. Six were detected only in wastewater, and one was detected in all the wastewater and river samples. Identification of these compounds provides additional evidence for the formation of new copper-binding ligands during treatment and confirms the presence of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds with copper-chelating properties in the wastewater. These findings demonstrate the utility of LCMS approaches for identifying and quantifying distinct organic-copper species in wastewater, as well as tracking their changes and removal during the treatment process."

The CuO NPs were initially synthesized using neem leaf extract and characterized through UV- Visible spectroscopy, SEM, EDX, HR-TEM, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, DLS and zeta potential. Characterization confirmed their monoclinic crystalline structure, spherical morphology, high purity, and stability, with a mean size of 50.93 nm and a zeta potential of -32.50 mV. The antifungal activities of synthesized CuO NPs against the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides were assessed using poisoned food technique in which 1000 ppm CuO NPs showed lowest colony diameter (20.70 mm) and highest per cent growth inhibition (77.00 %). Subsequently in a dipping treatment lowest per cent disease incidence (00.00 %) were recorded in fruit treated with CuO NPs @ 200 ppm and 250 ppm, respectively. While, highest shelf life (18.23 days) were recorded in fruit treated with CuO NPs @ 250 ppm. Untreated control fruit exhibited increased per cent weight loss, total sugar, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar and total soluble solids (TSS) over the storage period which responsible for early and rapid ripening. Post-harvest treatments of CuO NPs improved mango quality by reducing weight loss, retaining firmness, and delaying ripening through maintaining peel thickness, lower sugar levels, and higher titratable acidity and ascorbic acid. The 250 ppm concentration was most effective, ensuring safety with copper levels below toxicity thresholds. Therefore, A. indica-CuO NPs treatment is an eco-friendly and safe alternative to preserve fruit quality, reducing post-harvest disease/losses and extending the storage period (shelf life) of mango by delayed the ripening process.",

In this study, we measured the photosynthetic characteristics of Ulva lactuca exposed to varying Cu concentrations and different temperatures (10 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °C). The results indicated that at the same temperature, as the concentration of Cu increased, the relative growth rate of U. lactuca showed a decreasing trend. Under three different temperatures, the photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content of the algae significantly decreased with the increase in Cu concentration. Under the same Cu concentration conditions, as the temperature rises, the RGR of the algae gradually increases. In the case of low Cu concentration (LCu), the net photosynthetic rate at 15 °C and 20 °C increased by 103.72% and 104.97%, respectively, compared to the rate at 10 °C. Under high Cu concentration (HCu), the net photosynthetic rate at 15 °C and 20 °C increased by 192.18% and 245.67%, respectively, compared to that at 10 °C. The pigment content showed a similar trend. These results indicated that under the same temperature conditions, high concentrations of Cu inhibited the growth of algae, while under the same Cu treatment conditions, a suitable increase in temperature could alleviate the toxic effects of Cu on the algae.",

      "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma remains a highly aggressive malignancy with persistently high global incidence and mortality rates, posing significant challenges for effective treatment. Traditional chemotherapies lack specificity, leading to damage in normal tissues and severe side effects, highlighting the urgent need for targeted therapeutic strategies. In this study, copper and calcium co-doped carbon dots (Cu/Ca-CDs) were synthesized using a vacuum-confined heating method. These Cu/Ca-CDs demonstrated excellent tumor-targeting ability through specific binding to folate receptors on murine squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SCC7), facilitated by their pterin ring structure. Mechanistic studies revealed that Cu/Ca-CDs induced SCC7 tumor cell death through copper-induced cuproptosis and calcium overload-mediated apoptosis, as confirmed by Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and Rhod-2 calcium probe analyses. The dual-mode imaging capability of Cu/Ca-CDs, enabled by fluorescence and computed tomography properties, allowed for real-time tracking of their distribution and accumulation within tumors. This imaging-guided approach ensured precise delivery to tumor tissues while minimizing damage to normal tissues. In vivo experiments demonstrated significant tumor volume reduction and increased survival rates in tumor-bearing mice treated with Cu/Ca-CDs, without any observed toxicity to normal tissues or changes in body weight, underscoring the efficacy and biosafety of Cu/Ca-CDs. These findings highlight Cu/Ca-CDs as a promising strategy for precision oncology, offering effective tumor targeting, dual-mode imaging, and synergistic anti-tumor efficacy with reduced side effects.",

Significant questions remain as to its pathogenesis, especially the triggers for the associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). We examined the extent to which SSc and SSc-ILD were related to oxidative stress and altered metal homeostasis at the air-lung interface. METHODS: In this case-control study, we recruited 20 SSc patients, of which 11 had SSc-ILD. Eighteen healthy individuals were recruited as age-matched healthy controls, for a total of 38 study participants. Low molecular weight antioxidants (ascorbate, urate and glutathione), metal transport and chelation proteins (transferrin and ferritin) and metals (Fe and Cu) concentrations, including a measure of the catalytically active metal pool, were determined in respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) collected by bronchoalveolar lavage from the SSc group and compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: In the SSc group, 14 individuals were of female sex (70%) and the median age was 57 years (range 35-75). We observed evidence of oxidative stress in the RTLFs of SSc patients, characterised by increased concentrations of glutathione disulphide (GSSG, P<0.01), dehydroascorbate (DHA, P<0.05) and urate (P<0.01). This was associated with elevated RTLF Fe (P=0.07) and Cu (P<0.001), and evidence of a catalytic metal pool, demonstrated by an enhanced rate of ascorbate oxidation in the recovered lavage fluid (p<0.01). Cu concentrations were significantly associated with the ascorbate depletion rate (r=0.76, P<0.001), and GSSG (r=0.38, P<0.05) and protein carbonyl (r=0.44, P<0.01) concentrations. Whilst these markers were all increased in SSc patients, we found no evidence for an association with SSc-ILD. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the presence of oxidative stress in the airways of SSc patients and, for the first time, suggest that an underlying defect in metal homeostasis at the air-lung interface may play a role in disease progression."

Copper is used to combat PLB mainly in organic production, but its reduction or elimination as fungicide is a priority in Europe, and it is already banned in some countries. Alternative control strategies, including botanicals, could reduce copper and control PLB. We investigated the application of Frangula alnus bark, its sequential use with reduced copper, and reduced copper applications alone in field and lab experiments. Different dosages and preparations influenced F. alnus efficacy and the quantity of its posited active ingredients. Through in vitro and in planta experiments, we investigated whether F. alnus directly or indirectly controlled PLB. A bacterium (Erwinia spp.), originating from the F. alnus extract, colonized the media and caused most of the direct inhibition in vitro, but filtering out microorganisms had no effect on the extract's efficacy in planta. The contribution of extract-associated microorganisms to PLB control is unclear and requires additional experimentation to assess. The measured anthraquinones likely contributed to the effect of F. alnus. During four years of field experiments, the reduced copper and F. alnus treatments decreased disease severity in four and in three of the years, respectively, compared to the water control. No differences in disease severity or yield were observed between full and reduced copper treatments. Potato variety more consistently drove differences in total and marketable yields compared to the treatment. The yield was relatively stable within each year, suggesting that the treatment's effect on yield is intertwined with the timing of disease development and environmental conditions."

METHODS: The protoscolicidal properties of CNP were examined in vitro on hydatid cyst PS via the eosin exclusion assay. The in vivo effectiveness of CNP at doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day for 28 days on hydatid cyst-infected mice was determined by assessing the number, size, weight of hydatid cysts the gene expression levels of caspase-3, antioxidant (glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) and inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)) in the infected mice were also assessed by Real-time PCE. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that the CNP had a spherical shape, ranging in size from 10 to 85 nm. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for CNP against protoscoleces ranged from 39.9 to 341.3 µg/mL. Caspase-3 gene expression in the PS treated with CNP at 1/3 IC50, ½ IC50, and IC50 was 1.79-, 3.11-, and 5.39-fold change (p < 0.001). Upon administration of CNP, particularly at doses of 80 mg/kg, a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in hydatid cysts' quantity, size, and weight was evident. CNP treatment caused a notable reduction in oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines and increased the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (p < 0.001), whereas it modulated the serum levels of liver function parameters. CONCLUSION: The study indicated the potential of green-synthesized CNP for eliminating the protoscoleces and in managing hydatid cysts through leveraging its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Nevertheless, additional investigations are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action and evaluate its effectiveness in clinical trials. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

However, the inferior conductivity of Cu NWs compared to silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and the significant room temperature oxidation behavior have limited their widespread application and versatility. In this study, we present OA-Cu NW flexible transparent conductive films (FTCFs), which exhibit higher initial electrical performance and room temperature oxidation resistance. Initially, we synthesized high-purity Cu NWs and established a uniformly distributed Cu NW network on a PET substrate. Subsequently, post-treatment was carried out using a 0.1 M oxalic acid (OA) solution to immobilize oxalic acid on the Cu NWs. The resulting OA-Cu NW FTCFs show improved electrical properties compared to the original Cu NW FTCFs, with an optimal enhancement of 25%. The film demonstrated excellent room temperature oxidation resistance, showing minimal sheet resistance growth after 70 days of air exposure. Furthermore, the OA-Cu NW FTCFs exhibited good flexibility, as indicated by minimal changes in optoelectronic performance after a rigorous bend test of 10 000 cycles. The OA treatment not only effectively enhanced the performance of Cu NW FTCFs, but also circumvented high energy consumption and the selection of rare metal materials, thereby reducing the overall cost. As a result, the potential for large-scale production and application of Cu NW films is enhanced."

Copper(II) ion complexation to the photosensitizer renders it in the OFF position in terms of fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The interaction of the Cu2+-BODIPY complex with nitric oxide interchanges both fluorescence and therapy mode into the ON state through the detachment of the cation. Therefore, targeting the cancer cells would be expected to be achieved in this way. Moreover, one of the compounds, AP5, has increased aqueous solubility due to the polar structure. The designed structures also have near-infrared (IR) absorption ability up to 800 nm aqueous solutions. In addition, through using in vitro cell culture studies with HeLa and RAW264.7 cell lines, we confirmed that AP5 and AP6 could be activated in the presence of NO, and cell photocytotoxicity occurred extensively compared with the NO-absent cells. We believe that this work will provide new opportunities for the increased efficacy of the photodynamic treatment of cancer and smart photosensitizer design."

      "abstract": "The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal-plane (Cu-SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu-SC in 0.1 m NaOH is reduced to 1.99 × 10-3 mm yr-¹, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 × 10- 2 mm yr-¹). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti-counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu-SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144 h at 85 °C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles. The enhanced anti-oxidation properties of Cu-SC ensure the stability of its microstructures, which are critical for deep learning-based authentication, allowing precise feature extraction and accurate label verification even under extreme conditions. These results highlight the potential of (111) surface reconstruction for enhancing material stability, enabling advanced anti-counterfeiting applications, and promoting the sustainable utilization of metallic materials."

      "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the most prevalent form of lung cancer, exerting a substantial impact on global health. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for NSCLC, but resistance and severe side effects present significant clinical challenges. Recently, novel tetravalent platinum compounds have attracted significant interest. While numerous studies concentrate on their functional modifications and targeted delivery, tumor-induced platinum resistance is frequently overlooked. Previous tetravalent platinum compound demonstrated antitumor activity, yet proved ineffective against cells exhibiting resistance to cisplatin. In order to enhance the efficacy and potential applications of tetravalent platinum in NSCLC, a glutathione (GSH)-responsive albumin nanoquadrivalent platinum (HSA@Pt) have been constructed. In light of previous research into drug conjugation, this study was to develop a combined chemo-immunotherapy approach. The HSA@Pt demonstrated high efficacy and low toxicity, with targeted tumor accumulation. Furthermore, Ammonium Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) has been demonstrated to exert a synergistic inhibitory effect on ATPase Copper Transporting Beta (ATP7B) and Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), impede platinum efflux, induce cellular stress, and activate antitumor immunity. The findings suggest HSA@Pt's potential for clinical use and a novel chemo-immunotherapy strategy for NSCLC, enhancing the utility of established drugs through synergistic sensitization.",

      "abstract": "As global pollution intensifies, water contamination─a critical issue for both human and ecological survival─has become increasingly severe. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a rapid and stable water disinfection method to ensure clean water. In this study, high-surface-area Cu composite films were first deposited on a conductive substrate through an in situ electrodeposition process. The derived copper nanowire (M-Cu/Cu2O NWs) electrodes were then synthesized by controlled in situ growth and electrochemical reduction-decomposition of the Cu composite films. The working electrode was then placed on the cathode for water disinfection. The results demonstrated excellent and stable antimicrobial performance against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Citrobacter freundii. The in situ reduction method for preparing derived copper electrodes can help prevent reoxidation during synthesis, promote the formation of an excellent crystal structure, and reduce grain boundaries and defects, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and chemical stability of the Cu/Cu2O nanowires. Furthermore, the cathodic environment of the working electrode significantly reduces metal corrosion caused by oxidation, further enhancing its durability. The sterilization mechanism is the membrane's electroporation caused by nanowires' tip effect. It has been demonstrated that the M-Cu/Cu2O NWs cathode electrode can continuously maintain a bacterial inactivation rate above 90% for 30 days at an 8 V working potential. Due to the simple electrode fabrication method, stable disinfection efficiency, and significant reduction in copper ion release, which minimizes secondary environmental contamination, this system holds great potential for safe and stable water treatment applications."

      "abstract": "The therapeutic potential of celastrol (Cel) in cancer treatment has been constrained by its intrinsic hydrophobicity and the lack of efficient delivery systems. Herein, a biomineralization-based strategy is introduced to construct hybrid nanoparticles (Cel-TA-Cu NP) via Cel-Cu2⁺ coordination, followed by TA-Cu2⁺ crosslinking. Biomineralization, a nature-inspired process facilitating the controlled assembly of inorganic-organic structures, enables Cel to form coordination complexes with Cu2⁺, which subsequently serve as nucleation sites for tannic acid-mediated copper mineralization. Unlike conventional nanocarriers, this approach exploits the intrinsic metal-binding capacity of Cel to induce spontaneous mineralization, where Cu2⁺ serves both as a coordination center for drug encapsulation and as a therapeutic agent for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). The pH-responsive dissociation of metal-phenolic coordination ensures tumor-specific drug release, while the biomineralization process inherently enhances aqueous stability and bioavailability. Moreover, the rational design of Cel-TA-Cu NP enables a synergistic anticancer effect by simultaneously triggering apoptotic signaling pathways and amplifying oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity. Overall, this biomineralization-based nanoplatform not only overcomes the inherent limitations of Cel but also integrates CDT to markedly enhance therapeutic efficacy, providing a promising avenue for advanced cancer treatment.",

The potential of Morus nigra in stem node culture was investigated for the production of phenolic compounds and their elicitation with CuSO4. Individual phenolic compounds in the samples were identified and quantified by using HPLC-PDA and HPLC-MS methods, while the content of total phenolic compounds, the content of total flavonoids, and the antioxidant activity of methanolic extracts were evaluated spectrophotometrically. The highest fresh and dry weights were obtained in plantlets treated with 0.5 mM CuSO4 for 42 days. The highest total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity of the extracts were determined in stem node cultures treated with 3 mM CuSO4 for 42 days. Under the latter conditions, the predominant representatives of the caffeoylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid derivatives, kaempferol derivatives, and quercetin derivatives also achieved the highest content. The most abundant phenolic compound in all samples was the chlorogenic acid. The nodal culture of M. nigra elicited with CuSO4 could potentially be used for the industrial production of phenolic compounds, especially caffeoylquinic acids. Moreover, considering the biochemical response to CuSO4 treatment and the ability to tolerate and accumulate copper, the potential application of M. nigra in phytoremediation is also highlighted."

METHODS: Six to eight-week- old female BALB/c mice were burned with a 1 cm2 heated copper plate on the left flank and then divided into four treatment groups, treated with C8 (nanochelating-based CuNPs), cold cream (supplementary materials) as a control drug, Silver Sulfadiazine and no treatment, respectively. Skin tissue samples were taken from the mice on days 0, 3, 8, 15 and 24. One piece was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for pathological examination and the others were stored at -80°C until used for pro-inflammatory and growth factor gene expression. RESULTS: The healing process in the group treated with 10 mg/ml C8 was significantly faster, and the survival rate of the mice in this group was significantly higher than in the other groups. The pro-inflammatory genes were expressed and down-regulated earlier in the C8 treated mice. Histopathology confirmed the higher cure rate in the group treated with 10 mg/ml C8 compared to other control groups. CONCLUSION: C8 has beneficial effects on the healing of burn wounds and the effective dose of this compound should be further investigated. The present study demonstrates the anti-inflammatory properties of nano-chelate-based copper particles' on mouse skin burns. This research opens up new possibilities in dermatology and burn therapy and highlights the potential of copper-based formulations in the treatment of burn injuries."

      "abstract": "Bacterial infections often hinder the wound-healing process. Antibiotics are commonly used to eradicate bacteria, but long-term use can lead to the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising technology that utilizes a photothermal agent (PTA) to convert near-infrared radiation into heat, which can eliminate bacteria and has the advantages of being highly effective, controllable, and low drug resistance. In this study, we obtained silk fibroin-copper sulfide nanoparticles(SF/CuS NPs)in situ with excellent photothermal responsive properties by a green synthesis strategy using silk fibroin proteins as biological templates. Then, the SF/CuS NPs were mixed with PVA solution, and the photothermal nanofiber membrane (PVA-SF/CuS) was prepared using the electrostatic spinning technique. The synthesized SF/CuS NPs endowed the nanofiber membrane with excellent photothermal sterilization properties. In addition, the constructed PVA-SF/CuS nanofibrous membranes had good cytocompatibility and haemocompatibility. Meanwhile, in vivo experiments confirmed that PVA-SF/CuS nanofibrous membrane could inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory factor (IL-6), promote the expression of angiogenic factor (VEGF), and accelerate collagen deposition and neovascularization under near-infrared light irradiation, which could then promote the healing of infected wounds. Thus, the PVA-SF/CuS nanofiber membrane provides a new candidate material for treating bacterially infected wounds."

Here, we report a case of copper deficiency peripheral neuropathy in Wilson's disease and present the characteristics of its nerve biopsy. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44-year-old female patient diagnosed with Wilson's disease was on long-term oral administration of zinc gluconate and copper chelators. In June 2022, she developed symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, accompanied by anemia and neutropenia. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 53.85 µg. Serum copper was 66.6 µg/L, and ceruloplasmin was 0.01 g/L. Electromyography showed length-dependent axonal damage in peripheral nerves. Sural nerve biopsy showed mainly axonal damage and decreased density of nerve fibres of all classes (large and small myelinated and unmyelinated), accompanied by demyelination. Ultimately, the diagnosis of copper deficiency peripheral neuropathy caused by excessive treatment of Wilson's disease was established. After discontinuing copper chelation therapy, she experienced mild alleviation of symptoms. CONCLUSION: The pathological features of copper deficiency peripheral neuropathy in Wilson's disease include the formation of axonal vacuoles, the presence of myelin ovoids, and a reduced number of large and small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers. This case emphasizes the importance of monitoring copper metabolism during the stable phase of treatment for patients with Wilson's disease.",

The diffuse reflectance absorption spectra showed the absorption onsets due to copper oxide (885 nm) and zinc oxide (310 and 580 nm) in the product. The adsorption of methylene blue was fitted well by the Langmuir model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 454 mg⋅g-1. The thermodynamic studies revealed that the process is exothermic and spontaneous. The photocatalytic activity of the hybrid was assessed by the degradation of methylene blue in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The most active species in the photocatalytic process was hydroxyl radicals. The regenerated copper oxide/zinc oxide-montmorillonite was reused up to 5 cycles, the photodegradation efficiency dropped only 5% (from 94% to 89%), supporting the good stability of the photocatalyst. The result was in agreement with the advantages of the nanocomposite heterostructure and the unique nature of montmorillonite."

This study aims to develop an optimized stability formulation of copper histidinate and to evaluate its chemical stability using validated methods, supported by microbiological and elemental impurity risk assessment. The original formulation was modified by altering the stoichiometric ratio of histidine to copper from 1:2 to 1:3 (Cu-Hiinj 1:3). The results indicated a significantly enhanced stability for Cu-Hiinj 1:3, maintaining copper integrity under all tested conditions, unlike Cu-Hiinj 1:2, which exhibited notable copper degradation at temperatures above 8°C. The new formulation displayed no degradation except at 60°C, rendering the calculation of validity period (t90) unfeasible. This significantly enhanced stability is attributed to the increased histidine content in Cu-Hiinj 1:3, which augments the chelating capacity of the copper-histidine complex. Additionally, two validated analytical methods, namely flame atomic absorption spectrometry and redox titration (the latter being an accessible analytical method for compounding pharmacies), demonstrated precision and accuracy for copper quantification, with negligible matrix effects. Sterility tests confirmed the absence of microbial growth, validating the aseptic manufacturing process. This study extends and optimizes the manufacturing procedure by incorporating active principles as salts or neutral substances and accommodating a broader pH range. The Cu-Hiinj 1:3 formulation not only offers enhanced stability but also shows potential for industrial production, thus improving access to Menkes disease treatment while ensuring safety and efficacy."

      "abstract": "Mixtures of pollutants are a significant challenge for conventional wastewater treatment processes. In the present work, the potential of a biofilm reactor to simultaneously remove nitrate (NO3--N), carbamazepine (CBZ), and copper ions (Cu2+) was evaluated. The reactor was filled with FeMn-modified ceramsite (CS@FeMn) and inoculated with the strains of Cupriavidus sp. HY129 and Pantoea sp. MFG10, which contributed to the redox cycling of Mn. Under optimum conditions with the HRT, C/N and pH of 9.0 h, 2.0, and 7.0, respectively, the bioreactor incorporating CS@FeMn demonstrated a significant increase in nitrogen removal capacity compared to the CS carrier, achieving a NRE of 96.7 %. Moreover, the removal efficiencies of CBZ and Cu²⁺ reached the values of 91.8 % and 85.6 %, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the removals of CBZ and Cu²⁺ were closely associated with microbial activity, involving the combined effects of microbial metabolism, adsorption of CS@FeMn, and bioprecipitation. Analyses through high-throughput sequencing and KEGG pathway revealed that the presence of CBZ and Cu²⁺ reshaped the structure of microbial community within the bioreactor, driving the regulation of functional genes and nitrogen metabolism-related genes to maintain metabolic stability. These findings indicated that the CS@FeMn bioreactor system presents an effective solution for simultaneously addressing multiple pollutants in water treatment, achieving high efficiencies in NO3--N, CBZ, and Cu2+ removal."

      "abstract": "Copper plays crucial roles in fundamental life processes, including proliferation, metabolism, and survival. Copper deficiency is associated with multiple diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and Wilson's disease. Therapeutic programs targeting copper supply are prospectively employed for disease intervention. Herein, we developed biofriendly copper ionophores (HQFs) by constructing pseudonatural flavonols, which possess flavonoid bioactivity and enhanced copper transport properties. In cell models and mice, we found that HQF-mediated copper delivery synergistically, safely, and efficiently intervened in the development of fatty liver. Mechanistically, NAFLD remission involves fatty acid metabolism, anti-inflammatory processes, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enhancement. Our work is the first to propose the utilization of synergistic copper loading and flavonoid activity for NAFLD intervention, which may inform the clinical management of liver disease.",

      "abstract": "Here, two mixed-ligand mononuclear [Cu(L1)py] (1), [Cu(L2)Him] (2) and one dinuclear copper(II) complex [Cu2(L3)2(DMSO)(MeOH)] (3) were isolated in solid state and characterized through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Herein, we highlight the solution behavior of these complexes in solution medium through HRMS and ESR. Though the complexes maintain their integrity with respect to the ligand coordination, there is solvent or co-ligand exchange and generation of both [Cu(L)(py/Him)] or [Cu(L)(H2O)] species. G-quadruplex (G4-DNA) structures in the human telomeric DNA (hTelo) and promoter regions of oncogenes (c-MYC) can behave as potential therapeutic targets for the cancer treatment. Hence, the interaction of these complexes with G4-DNA and also duplex DNA was investigated through spectroscopy and molecular docking studies. The results reveal that the copper complexes show higher affinity for G4-DNA over duplex DNA, with 3 demonstrating the strongest binding among them. The complexes have also been tested for DNA nuclease activity against pUC19 plasmid DNA. Finally, the complexes showed significant cytotoxicity towards cancerous cell lines, namely HeLa and MCF-7 in comparison to the noncancerous cell line NIH-3T3. Annexin V/PI double staining assay demonstrated the apoptotic mode of cell death caused by the complexes. Overall, the results of G4-DNA interaction and anticancer activity are consistent, suggesting G4-DNA is the target for their biological activity."

      "abstract": "Copper exposure poses potential detrimental effects on both public and ecosystem health. Spermidine, an antioxidant, has shown promise in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation within the liver. However, its specific role in mitigating copper-induced hepatic cuproptosis and disturbances in copper metabolism remains unexplored. Consequently, this research aims to investigate to examine the impact of spermidine on hepatic cuproptosis and the related disturbances in copper metabolism. In the study, we established a model of copper-induced liver toxicity by feeding C57BL/6 mice a high-copper diet for three months. Histopathological and biochemical analyses revealed that copper exposure induced hepatic inflammatory cell infiltration, hepatocyte degeneration, elevated levels of MDA, ROS, and Cu2+ accumulation in the liver, and increased ALT and AST activities in serum (p < .05). Regarding inflammation, copper exposure significantly increased serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (p < .05), upregulated TNF-α and IFN-γ expression, and downregulated IL-10 expression in the liver (p < .05). Meanwhile, copper exposure inhibited the expression of copper metabolism and Fe-S cluster-related proteins (p < .05). Exogenous spermidine administration effectively reduced ROS, MDA, and Cu2+ accumulation in the liver, while also decreasing ALT and AST activites, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in the serum (p < .05), and downregulated TNF-α and IFN-γ expression (p < .001). Additionally, spermidine combined with CuSO4 treatment significantly promotes the expression of copper metabolism and Fe-S cluster-related proteins, compared to the CuSO4 group (p < .05). In summary, spermidine reduces Cu2+ accumulation in the liver, alleviates hepatic cuproptosis, oxidative damage, and inflammation, and exerts a protective effect on the liver.",

      "abstract": "Silver-coated copper powder, a cost-effective alternative to pure silver, has gained attention for its potential applications in electronics, energy, and catalysis. To explore the impact of heat treatment on its properties, a series of experiments were conducted with temperature increments of 50 ∘C and varying holding times. The silver-coated copper powder was prepared through chemical plating and was heat-treated to assess changes in surface morphology, conductivity, density, and antioxidant performance. Results show that heat treatment significantly improved surface flatness and smoothness, particularly at 600 ∘C for 5 min followed by 700 ∘C for 10 min. After treatment, the specific surface area decreased from 0.2282 m2/g to 0.2217 m2/g, while bulk density increased from 2.813 g/cm3 to 2.945 g/cm3, improving fluidity and stability. However, dislocation defects and the elimination of surface plasmon coupling between silver particles reduced conductivity, with resistance rising from 2.8 mΩ to 3.2 mΩ. X-ray diffraction showed an increase in silver grain size from 13.68 nm to 20.33 nm, enhancing density but increasing electron scattering. Heat treatment also raised the initial oxidation temperature from 200 ∘C to 230 ∘C but accelerated subsequent oxidation. This study improves upon existing technology by significantly enhancing the surface smoothness, oxidation resistance, density, and specific surface area of the silver-coated copper powder."
