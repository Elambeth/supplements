      "abstract": "The treatment of black tea fermentation with different exogenous tannases was investigated, and processing parameters during black tea fermentation, including fermentation time, fermentation temperature, and exoenzyme amounts, were optimized, while the consumption and transformation pathways of catechins were analyzed. The results showed that tannase from Aspergillus niger was ultimately selected as the optimal enzyme to effectively increase the content of theaflavins by promoting the hydrolysis reaction and benzoylation reaction of catechins, resulting in a greater theaflavin (TF) content of 1.41%. The optimal processing conditions were found to be a fermentation time of 3 h, a fermentation temperature of 20 °C, and 1 g of tannase for 300 g of rolled tea leaves. Processing with the exogenous tannase could provide an ideal choice for the efficient utilization of summer and autumn fresh tea leaves, and could be used to develop summer and autumn black tea and to improve the content of theaflavins. It could also be used to develop deep processing of tea products with theaflavin extracts in the future.",

      "abstract": "Theaflavins, powerful antioxidants found in black tea ( Camellia sinensis ), have garnered increasing interest for their promising therapeutic potential. Experimental studies have contributed to enlightening about the advantages of theaflavins, including their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiosteoporosis, and antimicrobial properties. Theaflavin and its derivatives, particularly theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, have been particularly noted for their enhanced action in different areas. These compounds have found an important role as alternatives or adjuvants in the pharmaceutical sector, food industry, and in the improvement of health conditions. This review focuses on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory aspects of theaflavins, particularly their potential in addressing peri-implant osteolysis. We explore mechanisms and pathways involved in this therapeutic action. Furthermore, we cover some of the relevant studies on the antimicrobial action of theaflavins in both the health and food sectors. Specifically, we explore the use of theaflavins for the treatment of dental infections, where these compounds have shown particular efficacy against several bacterial strains and their antimicrobial application in food matrices. Given the low solubility and stability of theaflavins in physiological conditions, we emphasize the benefits of the development of biocompatible and biodegradable nanoformulations to enhance the stability, bioavailability, and efficacy of these polyphenols, to promote their broader research and application. Given the potential demonstrated so far by in vitro and in vivo studies, the application of theaflavins stands as a promising alternative to enhance the existing strategies and fight prosthetic failure and antimicrobial resistance in the health and food sectors.",

      "abstract": "Hyperglycemia can cause early damage to human bady and develop into diabates that will severely threaten human healthy. The effectively clinical treatment of hyperglycemiais is by inhibiting the activity of α-amylase. Black tea has been reported to show inhibitory effect on α-amylase and can be used for hyperglycemia treatment. However, the mechanism underlying is unclear. In this study, in vivo experiment showed that black tea theaflavins extract (BTE) effectively alleviated hyperglycemia. In vitro experiment showed that the effects may be caused by the interation between theaflavins and α-amylase. While TF1 and TF3 were mixed type inhibitors of α-amylase, TF2A and TF2B were competitive inhibitors of α-amylase. Molecular docking analysis showed that theaflavins monomers interacted with the hydrophobic region of α-amylase. Further study verified that monomer-α-amylase complex was spontaneously formed depending on hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, theaflavins showed potential anti-hyperglycemia effect via inhibiting α-amylase activity. Our results suggested that theaflavins might be utilized as a new type of α-amylase inhibitor to prevent and cure hyperglycemia."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence and infection of the Zika virus (ZIKV) have recently posed a major threat to global public health security. However, there is currently a lack of specific vaccines and effective antiviral drugs for ZIKV infection. METHODS: Theaflavins TF1 and TF2 were selected by evaluating the anti-Zika virus activity of four kinds of theaflavins in vitro. Subsequently, in vivo, we investigated the effects of TF1 and TF2 on weight, survival, tissue viral load, and cytokines in ZIKV-infected mice. RESULTS: We compared the anti-ZIKV activity of four theaflavins (TFs) in cells and found that TF1 and TF2b significantly inhibited the replication of ZIKV/Z16006 toxic strain in BHK and Vero cells by inhibiting the replication and release of ZIKV, while no similar effects were observed for TF2a and TF3. In vivo assay, we only found that TF2b improved the survival rate of infected mice. In tissues of ZIKV-infected mice, the viral load was higher in spleen and blood, followed by liver, epididymis, and testis, the lowest in muscle. Additionally, TF2b treatment significantly reduced the expression of cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10) induced by ZIKV infection. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that TF2b has a potent antiviral effect and can be used as a potential candidate for the treatment of ZIKV infection.",

      "abstract": "With the development of diabetes, the gut microbiome falls into a state of dysbiosis, further affecting its progression. Theaflavins (TFs), a type of tea polyphenol derivative, show anti-diabetic properties, but their effect on the gut microbiome in diabetic mice is unclear. It is unknown whether the improvement of TFs on hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic mice is related to gut microbiota. Therefore, in this study, different concentrations of TFs were intragastrically administered to mice with diabetes induced by a high-fat-diet to investigate their effects on blood glucose, blood lipid, and the gut microbiome in diabetic mice, and the plausible mechanism underlying improvement in diabetes was explored from the perspective of the gut microbiome. The results showed that the TFs intervention significantly improved the hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia of diabetic mice and affected the structure of the gut microbiome by promoting the growth of bacteria positively related to diabetes and inhibiting those negatively related to diabetes. The changes in short-chain fatty acids in mice with diabetes and functional prediction analysis suggested that TFs may affect carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism by regulating the gut microbiome. These findings emphasize the ability of TFs to shape the diversity and structure of the gut microbiome in mice with diabetes induced by a high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin and have practical implications for the development of functional foods with TFs."

      "abstract": "Continuing caution is required against the potential emergence of SARS-CoV-2 novel mutants that could pose the next global health and socioeconomical threats. If virus in saliva can be inactivated by a beverage, such a beverage may be useful because the saliva of infected persons is the major origin of droplets and aerosols that mediate human-to-human viral transmission. We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 was significantly inactivated by treatment in vitro with tea including green tea and black tea. Catechins and its derived compounds galloylated theaflavins (gTFs) bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein and blocked interaction between RBD and ACE2. Black tea is often consumed with sugar, milk, lemon juice, etc., and it remains unclarified whether these ingredients may influence the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of black tea. Here, we examined the effect of black tea on Omicron subvariants in the presence of these ingredients. The infectivity of Omicron subvariants was decreased to 1/100 or lower after treatment with black tea for 10 s. One or two teaspoons of milk (4~8 mL) completely blocked the anti-viral effect of a cup of tea (125 mL), whereas an addition of sugar or lemon juice failed to do so. The suppressive effect was dose-dependently exerted by milk casein but not whey proteins. gTFs were coprecipitated with casein after acidification of milk-supplemented black tea, strongly suggesting the binding of gTFs to casein. The present study demonstrates for the first time that an addition of milk cancelled the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of black tea due to binding of casein to gTFs."

However, there is a lack of research into their application in large yellow croakers during refrigerated storage. This study investigated the effect of theaflavins on the quality of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) during 12 days of storage at 4 °C. RESULTS: The results showed that theaflavin treatment was able to inhibit microbial growth and reduce the production of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N). Meanwhile, theaflavins were beneficial in reducing the unfolding of myofibrillar proteins, decreasing the degree of protein aggregation, and improving the stability of protein structure. The degree of protein oxidation was lower in a theaflavin-treated group compared with an untreated group. Theaflavin treatment effectively inhibited increases in acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), and malonaldehyde (MDA) content. The effect of theaflavin was positively correlated with an increase in concentration under refrigeration conditions. This study therefore suggests that the use of theaflavins is a viable method for extending the period for which refrigerated large yellow croaker can be preserved. CONCLUSIONS: Adding theaflavins to large yellow croaker can be an effective method for preserving quality during refrigerated storage. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigated the effect and mechanism of theaflavins (TFs) on fluoride (F-) uptake and transport in the Caco-2 cell model through structural chemistry and transcriptome analysis. The results showed that the four major TFs (TF, TF3G, TF3'G and TFDG) at a 150 μg/mL concentration could all significantly decrease F- transport in Caco-2 cells after 2 h of treatment and, at 2 μg/mL F- concentration, the F- transport was more inclined to efflux. During transport, the F- retention in Caco-2 cells was significantly increased by TF3G while it was clearly decreased by TF. The interaction between TFs and F- was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry, and F- was shown to affect the π bond vibration on the benzene ring of TFs, thus influencing their stability. Additionally, F- showed weak binding to TF3G, TF3'G and TFDG, which may inhibit F- transport and absorption in the Caco-2 cell line. Transcriptome and RT-PCR analysis identified three key differentially expressed genes related to cell permeability, and TFs can be assumed to mediate F- transport by regulating the expression of permeability-related genes to change cell monolayer permeability and enhance cell barrier function; however, this needs to be further elucidated in future studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gout is a crystal related arthropathy caused by monosodium urate deposition. At present, the identification of appropriate treatments and new drugs to reduce serum uric acid levels and gout risk is a major research area. PURPOSE: Theaflavins are naturally occurring compounds characterized by a benzodiazepine skeleton. The significant benefits of theaflavins have been well documented. A large number of studies have been carried out and excellent anti-gout results have been achieved in recent years. STUDY DESIGN: A comprehensive analysis of the mechanism of the anti-gout effect of theaflavins is presented through a literature review and network pharmacology prediction, and strategies for increasing the bioavailability of theaflavins are summarized. METHODS: In this review, the active components and pharmacological mechanisms of theaflavins in the treatment of gout were summarized, and the relationship between theaflavins and gout, the relevant components, and the potential mechanisms of anti-gout action were clarified by reviewing the literature on the anti-gout effects of theaflavins and network pharmacology. RESULTS: Theaflavins exert anti-gout effects by down regulating the gene and protein expression of glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) and uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1), while upregulating the mRNA expression levels of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), organic cation transporter N1 (OCTN1), organic cation transporters 1/2 (Oct1/2), and organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2). Network pharmacology prediction indicate that theaflavins can regulate the AGE-RAGE and cancer signaling pathways through ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), recombinant mitogen activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), telomerase reverse tranase (TERT), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), and matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) targets for anti-gout effects. CONCLUSION: This review presents the mechanisms of anti-gout action of theaflavins and strategies for improving the bioavailability of theaflavins, as well as providing research strategies for anti-gout treatment measures and the development of novel anti-gout drugs.",

Currently, the treatment of food allergy mainly involves avoidance of allergens and allergen-specific immunotherapy. Barring the spontaneous resolution of food allergy during the growth process, this disease is difficult to treat fundamentally. In recent years, the use of functional food ingredients derived from natural products has been attracting attention for their prophylactic use in food allergy. Theaflavins, i.e., black tea polyphenols, are potent antioxidants that have inhibitory effects on a variety of diseases. However, little is known about the preventive effect of theaflavins on food allergy. In this study, we designed a mouse model of food allergy and examined the effect of theaflavins using the severity of diarrhea, a symptom of food allergy, as an indicator. The administration of a black tea extract rich in theaflavins or theaflavin 1 (subgroup of theaflavins) to mice reduced the severity of diarrhea when compared with a normal diet. A reduction in malondialdehyde levels, a key marker of lipid peroxidation, was also observed. Overall, these data suggest that theaflavins may potentially inhibit food allergy by alleviating oxidative stress in the colon and can be a potential food material for prevention of food allergy.",

Theaflavins (TFs), a mixture of ingredients formed from enzymatic oxidation of catechins during the manufacture of tea, have a positive contribution to the qualities and antiaging activities of black tea. However, the role of TFs in mitigating aging-induced cognitive dysfunction and the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we find that TFs effectively improve behavioral impairment via the microbiota-gut-brain axis: TFs maintain gut homeostasis by improving antioxidant ability, strengthening the immune response, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins, restructuring the gut microbiota, and altering core microbiota metabolites, i.e., short-chain fatty acids and essential amino acids (SCFAs and AAs), and upregulating brain neurotrophic factors. Removing the gut microbiota with antibiotics partly abolishes the neuroprotective effects of TFs. Besides, correlation analysis indicates that the decrease in gut microbiota, such as Bacteroidetes and Lachnospiraceae, and the increase in microbiota metabolites' levels are positively correlated with behavioral improvements. Taken together, our findings reveal a potential role of TFs in mitigating aging-driven cognitive dysfunction via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The intake of TFs can be translated into a novel dietary intervention approach against aging-induced cognitive decline.",

However, strategies for the effective prevention and treatment of CTX-induced ovarian damage are still lacking. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and theaflavins (TFs), key molecules derived from green tea or black tea, have been shown to exert preventive effects on many ageing-related diseases. PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the potential preventive and protective effects of EGCG and TFs on CTX-induced ovarian damage and compare the two compounds. STUDY DESIGN: Six-week-old female mice were administered a low or high dose of EGCG or TFs. The low dose was equivalent to the average daily amount of tea consumed by a drinker. METHODS: We determined the oestrous cycle and serum hormone levels to evaluate ovarian endocrine function, and we performed mating tests for reproductivity. We also assessed the follicle count and AMH level to evaluate ovarian reserve, and we performed Masson's trichrome and Sirius red staining to evaluate ovarian fibrosis. We conducted γ-H2AX and TUNEL analyses to evaluate DNA damage, and we also measured the relevant indicators of oxidative stress and follicular activation, including NRF2, HO-1, SOD2, AKT, mTOR and RPS6. RESULTS: EGCG and TFs treatment independently improved the ovarian endocrine function and reproductivity of mice that were administered CTX. EGCG and TFs also increased the ovarian reserve of these animals. Furthermore, EGCG and TFs alleviated oxidation-induced damage to ovarian DNA in mice by activating the NRF2/HO-1 and SOD2 pathways and reducing the apoptosis of growing follicles. At the same time, EGCG and TFs reduced the overactivation of primordial follicles by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/RPS6 pathway. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that EGCG and TFs independently improved ovarian function in mice with CTX-induced ovarian damage, thereby providing useful information for designing a potential clinical strategy that will protect against chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage.",

      "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans is the primary etiological agent associated with cariogenic process. The present study aimed to investigate the antibacterial and anti-virulence activities of theaflavins (TFs) to Streptococcus mutans UA159 as well as the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that TFs were capable of suppressing the acid production, cell adherence, water-insoluble exopolysaccharides production, and biofilm formation by S. mutans UA159 with a dosage-dependent manner while without influencing the cell growth. By a genome-wide transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), we found that TFs attenuated the biofilm formation of S. mutans UA159 by inhibiting glucosyltransferases activity and the production of glucan-binding proteins (GbpB and GbpC) instead of directly blocking the expression of genes coding for glucosyltransferases. Further, TFs inhibited the expression of genes implicated in peptidoglycan synthesis, glycolysis, lipid synthesis, two-component system, signaling peptide transport (comA), oxidative stress response, and DNA replication and repair, suggesting that TFs suppressed the virulence factors of S. mutans UA159 by affecting the signal transduction and cell envelope stability, and weakening the ability of cells on oxidative stress resistance. In addition, an upregulated expression of the genes involved in protein biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, and transport system upon TFs treatment indicated that cells increase the protein synthesis and nutrients uptake as one self-protective mechanism to cope with stress caused by TFs. The results of this study increase our current understanding of the anti-virulence activity of TFs on S. mutans and provide clues for the use of TFs in the prevention of dental caries."

Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 was decreased to 1/100 to undetectable levels after a treatment with black tea, green tea, roasted green tea, or oolong tea for 1 min. An addition of (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly inactivated SARS-CoV-2, while the same concentration of theasinensin A (TSA) and galloylated theaflavins including theaflavin 3,3'-di-O-gallate (TFDG) had more remarkable anti-viral activities. EGCG, TSA, and TFDG at 1 mM, 40 µM, and 60 µM, respectively, which are comparable to the concentrations of these compounds in tea beverages, significantly reduced infectivity of the virus, viral RNA replication in cells, and secondary virus production from the cells. EGCG, TSA, and TFDG significantly inhibited interaction between recombinant ACE2 and RBD of S protein.

In this study, we examined the effect of theaflavins on disuse muscle atrophy model mice by hindlimb suspension. Mice were assigned to 4 groups; ground-vehicle, ground-theaflavins, suspension-vehicle, and suspension-theaflavins, dosed with theaflavins (250 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. The peak of myotube size of cross sectional area was significantly moved to the smaller side in the suspension-vehicle group compared with the ground-vehicle group, and these shifts were significantly reduced by the treatment with theaflavins in both soleus and extensor digitorum longus. The level of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP)-1, located downstream of the Akt/mTOR pathway, was significantly different between suspension-vehicle and suspension-theaflavins in soleus. The ratio of forkhead box O (FoxO) 3a to phosphorylated FoxO3a significantly increased in soleus or tended to rise in extensor digitorum longus of suspension-vehicle group compared with ground-vehicle. In contrast, these changes were not observed in suspension-theaflavins group. These results suggested that theaflavins inhibited the progress of disuse muscle atrophy through modulation of protein metabolism."

      "abstract": "Cancer is a disease characterized by aberrant proliferative and apoptotic signaling pathways, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells combined with enhanced survival and evasion of cell death. Current treatment strategies are sometimes ineffective in eradicating more aggressive, metastatic forms of cancer, indicating the need to develop novel therapeutics targeting signaling pathways which are essential for cancer progression. Historically, plant-derived compounds have been utilized in the production of pharmaceuticals and chemotherapeutic compounds for the treatment of cancer, including paclitaxel and docetaxel. Theaflavins, phenolic components present in black tea, have demonstrated anti-cancer potential in cell cultures in vitro and in animal studies in vivo. Theaflavins have been shown to inhibit proliferation, survival, and migration of many cancer cellswhile promoting apoptosis. Treatment with theaflavins has been associated with increased levels of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and cleaved caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9, all markers of apoptosis, and increased expression of the proapoptotic marker Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and concomitant reduction in the antiapoptotic marker B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Additionally, theaflavin treatment reduced phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and c-Myc levels with increased expression of the tumour suppressor p53. This review summarizes the current in vitro and in vivo evidence available investigating the anti-cancer effects of theaflavins across various cancer cell lines and animal models.",

Catechins are known to transform into theaflavins during the tea manufacturing process, but the same transformation in preharvest tea leaves is unknown. Herein, we determined that shade treatment (dark), an agronomic practise widely used in tea cultivation, reduced the contents of most catechins, but increased the theaflavin contents, in preharvest tea leaves (cv. Yinghong No.9). This was attributed to the activation of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity in darkness. Furthermore, CsPPO3 was highly expressed under darkness, and thus CsPPO3 had been cloned, sequenced, and characterization. The CsPPO3 recombinant protein exhibited PPO function. Furthermore, shade treatment also reduced the catechin contents and increased the theaflavin contents in Yabukita and Hoshinomidori, suggesting that this phenomenon might not be specific to certain tea cultivars. This information will aid in understanding of theaflavin formation and its response to environmental factors at the preharvest tea stage.",

      "abstract": "Recently, phytochemical-based dietary intervention has gained attention as a preventive and curative strategy against cancers owing to their safety, better tolerance, and economics. Against this background, black tea extract which contains the flavanol-3-ol, theaflavins (TF), and thearubigins (TR) with promising anti-oncogenic activity were assessed to determine its in vitro inhibitory impact on colon cancer (HCT 116) and lung cancer cell lines (HT 460). In a dose-dependent manner, results revealed that TF, TR, and their combinations cause inhibition in cell viability. However, TF imparted a maximum reduction in cell viability of HCT 116 and HT 460. Flow cytometry data revealed that TF, TR, and their combinations exhibited substantial cell arrest at the G2/M phase. The influence was more prominent in lung cancer cells (HT 460) when compared with colon cells (HCT 116). All treatments resulted in apoptosis, however, the combination of TF and TR exhibited the highest apoptotic ability in comparison to individual treatments. TF and TR exhibited a synergistic impact and significantly inhibited cell proliferation of HCT 116 and HT 460 in dose- and time-dependent manners by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, wherein TF showed a more pronounced impact. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Results from the present study revealed that black tea-isolated polyphenols (TF and TR) exhibited a significant inhibition of lung and colon cancer cell growth. A promising synergistic effect of TF and TR as inhibitors of cancer cells was observed. More clinical work, perhaps on a human subject, is needed before these two isolated compounds can be prescribed as anticancer drugs.",

However, appearance of resistance and high cost of the therapy is still an obstacle in the achievement of the therapy, more specifically in developing countries. In this context, search for affordable antivirals with new mechanisms of action is still needed. Tea, after water, is the most popular drink worldwide. Polyphenols extracted from green tea have already shown anti-HCV activity as entry inhibitors. Here, three different theaflavins, theaflavin (TF1), theaflavin-3'-monogallate (TF2), and theaflavin-3-3'-digallate (TF3), which are major polyphenols from black tea, were tested against HCV in cell culture. The results showed that all theaflavins inhibit HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner in an early step of infection. Results obtained with HCV pseudotyped virions confirmed their activity on HCV entry and demonstrated their pan-genotypic action. No effect on HCV replication was observed by using HCV replicon. Investigation on the mechanism of action of black tea theaflavins showed that they act directly on the virus particle and are able to inhibit cell-to-cell spread. Combination study with inhibitors most widely used in anti-HCV treatment regimen demonstrated that TF3 exerts additive effect. In conclusion, theaflavins, that are present in high quantity in black tea, are new inhibitors of HCV entry and hold promise for developing in therapeutic arsenal for HCV infection.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of TFs on experimental periodontitis in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty rats were divided into five groups: Control (glycerol application without ligation), Ligature (glycerol application with ligation), TF1 (1 mg/mL TF application with ligation), TF10 (10 mg/mL TF application with ligation), and TF100 (100 mg/mL TF application with ligation). To induce experimental periodontitis, ligatures were placed around maxillary first molars bilaterally. After ligature placement, 100 μL glycerol or TFs were topically applied to the rats daily, and rats were euthanized 7 days after ligature placement. Micro-computed tomography was used to measure bone resorption in the left side of the maxilla, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, growth-regulated gene product/cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (Gro/Cinc-1, rat equivalent of IL-8), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp-9), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa Β ligand (Rankl), osteoprotegerin (Opg), and the Rankl/Opg ratio in gingival tissue. With tissue from the right side of the maxilla, hematoxylin and eosin staining was used for histological analysis, immunohistochemical staining for leukocyte common antigen (CD45) was used to assess inflammation, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to observe the number of osteoclasts. RESULTS: The TF10 and TF100 groups, but not the TF1 group, had significant inhibition of alveolar bone loss, reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration in the periodontium, and significantly reduced numbers of CD45-positive cells and TRAP-positive osteoclasts compared with the Ligature group. Correspondingly, the TF10 and TF100 groups had significantly downregulated gene expression of IL-6, Gro/Cinc-1(IL-8), Mmp-9, and Rankl, but not of Opg. Consequently, Rankl/Opg expression was significantly increased in the Ligation group but was attenuated in the TF10 and TF100 groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that topical application of TFs may reduce inflammation and bone resorption in experimental periodontitis. Therefore, TFs have therapeutic potential in the treatment of periodontal disease.",

      "abstract": "Ethanol‑induced diseases of the gastric mucosa are the most common and refractory diseases of gastrointestinal system in clinic, and are mediated by oxidative stress and apoptosis pathways. Theaflavins (TFs) are considered to be antioxidants. The present study aimed to determine the molecular mechanism underlying the ability of TFs to attenuate ethanol‑induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in GES‑1 gastric mucosa epithelial cells. A Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8) assay was performed to investigate the cell viability of GES‑1 cells following administration of ethanol (0.5 mol/l) and subsequent treatment with TFs (20, 40 and 80 µg/ml) for specific time intervals. A carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester assay was used to measure proliferation and further investigate the results of the CCK‑8 assay. Flow cytometry was performed to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the apoptosis rates of GES‑1 cells. Furthermore, levels of oxidative stress‑associated factors, including malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione, were investigated using commercial kits. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays were performed to determine the expression levels of apoptosis‑associated factors, as well as the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK), c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase (p38). The results of the present study demonstrated that treatment with ethanol inhibited GES‑1 cell proliferation, and enhanced ROS levels and apoptosis rates, potentially via downregulation of B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2) expression and upregulation of Bcl‑2‑associated X and caspase‑3 expression levels, as well as enhancing the phosphorylation levels of ERK, JNK and p38. However, treatment with TFs was revealed to attenuate the effects of ethanol administration on GES‑1 cells in a dose‑dependent manner. In conclusion, TFs may attenuate ethanol‑induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in gastric mucosa epithelial cells via downregulation of various mitogen‑activated protein kinase pathways.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress can induce neuronal apoptosis via the production of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. This process is as a major pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether theaflavins protect PC12 cells from oxidative stress damage induced by H2O2. A cell model of PC12 cells undergoing oxidative stress was created by exposing cells to 200 μM H2O2 in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of theaflavins (5, 10, and 20 μM). Cell viability was monitored using the MTT assay and Hoechst 33258 staining, showing that 10 μM theaflavins enhanced cell survival following 200 μM H2O2 induced toxicity and increased cell viability by approximately 40 %. Additionally, we measured levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzyme activity. This suggested that the neuroprotective effect of theaflavins against oxidative stress in PC12 cells is derived from suppression of oxidant enzyme activity. Furthermore, Western blot analyses indicated that theaflavins downregulated the ratio of pro-apoptosis/anti-apoptosis proteins Bax/Bcl-2. Theaflavins also downregulated the expression of caspase-3 compared with a H2O2-treated group that had not been treated with theaflavins. Interestingly, this is the first study to report that the four main components of theaflavins found in black tea can protect neural cells (PC12) from apoptosis induced by H2O2. These findings provide the foundations for a new field of using theaflavins or its source, black tea, in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases caused by oxidative stress.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of black tea theaflavins (TFs) on the virulence properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis and gingival keratinocyte tight junction integrity. In addition, the effects of black tea TFs on the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokine/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion by monocytes/macrophages were assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Virulence factor gene expression in P. gingivalis was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR. A fluorescence assay was used to determine P. gingivalis adherence to, and invasion of, a gingival keratinocyte monolayer. Tight junction integrity of gingival keratinocytes was assessed by determination of transepithelial electrical resistance. Proinflammatory cytokine and MMP secretion by P. gingivalis-stimulated macrophages was quantified by ELISA. The U937-3xκB-LUC monocyte cell line transfected with a luciferase reporter gene was used to monitor NF-κB activation. Gelatin degradation was monitored using a fluorogenic assay. RESULTS: Black tea TFs dose-dependently inhibited the expression of genes encoding the major virulence factors of P. gingivalis and attenuated its adherence to gingival keratinocytes. A treatment of gingival keratinocytes with black tea TFs significantly enhanced tight junction integrity and prevented P. gingivalis-mediated tight junction damage as well as bacterial invasion. Black tea TFs reduced the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, chemokine (C-X-C) ligand 8, MMP-3, MMP-8 and MMP-9 by P. gingivalis-stimulated macrophages and attenuated the P. gingivalis-mediated activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Lastly, black tea TFs inhibited gelatin degradation by MMP-9. CONCLUSION: This study provides clear evidence that black tea TFs represent promising multifunctional therapeutic agents for prevention and treatment of periodontal disease.",

However, the role of theaflavins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown. In this study, we found that theaflavins could significantly inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induce apoptosis in HCC cells in vitro. Furthermore, we found that theaflavins inhibited the growth and metastasis of HCC in an orthotopic model and a lung metastasis model. Immunohistochemical analyses and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling assays showed that theaflavins could suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in vivo. Theaflavins also suppressed constitutive and inducible signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation. The downstream proteins regulated by STAT3, including the antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Survivin) and the invasion-related proteins (MMP-2, MMP-9), were also downregulated after theaflavins treatment. Theaflavins induced apoptosis by activating the caspase pathway. Together, our results suggest that theaflavins suppress the growth and metastasis of human HCC through the blockage of the STAT3 pathway, and thus may act as potential therapeutic agents for HCC."

The present study in rats evaluated the influence of theaflavins on circulation. In addition, an intervention pilot study examined the influence of a theaflavin drink on postprandial hemodynamic change. In an animal study, a single oral dose of theaflavin rich fraction (TF, 10mg/kg) caused transient increase in mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR). TF also elevated cremastric blood flow significantly, and the magnitude of this effect was in this order: theaflavin 3'-O-gallate (TF2B) >>theaflavin-3-O-gallate (TF2A) >>theaflavin (TF1)=theaflavin-3, 3'-di-O-gallate (TF3). In addition, these hemodynamic alterations in mammals totally disappeared when pretreated with carvedilol as an adrenaline blocker. We also treated 10-mg/kg/day TF to the rats for 2 weeks. At the end of the ingestion period, MBP was reduced significantly, and aortic eNOS level was elevated by the repeated ingestion of TF compared with distilled water. In the intervention trial, blood pressure of the volunteers was increased significantly 2 and 4h after ingestion of the TF drink (45mg/drink) compared with before treatment. A significant difference was observed in FMD between the placebo and theaflavin groups 4h after ingestion. These results suggested that theaflavin has potent activity to alter hemodynamics in both murine and healthy subjects. Further studies is needed to elucidate the details; however, the results of animal study suggested that the possible involvement of sympathetic nervous system in the hemodynamic changes caused by TF.",

The study was performed to gain more insight into the effects of theaflavins on microcirculation and to compare effects with another important flavonoid class, the green tea derived catechins, which have been reported to improve vascular function. Twenty-four healthy subjects were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over study. On six different days, subjects received capsules with a single dose of catechins (500 mg), four varying doses of theaflavins (100 to 500 mg) or placebo. Microcirculation was assessed after each treatment by Pulse Amplitude Tonometry (EndoPAT) at baseline and 2, 4 and 6 h after test product intake. The EndoPAT reactive hyperemia response was improved by 500 mg catechins (reactive hyperemia index (RHI): 0.2; p = 0.04) and by 500 mg theaflavins (RHI: 0.19; p = 0.06) compared to placebo. Also, 300 mg theaflavins increased the RHI (0.28; p = 0.02), but no effects were observed at lower doses.

The potential effect of tea extracts, theaflavins, and epitheaflagallin on staphylococcal growth was studied. A broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of these samples against an SEA-producing strain, Staphylococcus aureus C-29. The following assays were performed to evaluate various effects on concentrations of no effect on staphylococcal growth. The interactions of theaflavin-rich green tea extracts (TGE), theaflavins, and epitheaflagallin to cultured S. aureus C-29 were determined using Western blot analysis. As a result, all samples suppressed the binding affinity of the anti-SEA antibody to SEA. Since these samples could react directly with SEA, we examined whether they could bind to SEA. Our results demonstrated that binding of the anti-SEA antibody to 4 theaflavins-treated SEA was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the production of SEA was significantly decreased by treatment with TGE and epitheaflagallin. Based on the finding that TGE and epitheaflagallin inhibit the production of SEA, we further examined the relative expression levels of sea toxin-encoding genes after treatment with TGE and epitheaflagallin with real-time RT-PCR. TGE and epitheaflagallin significantly supressed the gene transcription of SEA in S. aureus C-29. We then tested whether the samples block the biological activity of SEA in murine spleen cells. TGE, theaflavins, and epitheaflagallin became inactivated the biological activity of SEA. These results suggest that edible and safe compounds in tea can be used to inactivate both pathogens and toxins.",

Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a major aetiological agent associated with periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting tooth-supporting tissues. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of theaflavins on pathogenic properties of P. gingivalis and on periodontitis by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) production induced by this oral pathogen. METHODS: Microplate dilution assays were performed to determine the effect of theaflavins against planktonic culture and biofilm of P. gingivalis. The effect of theaflavins on gingipain and collagenase activities of P. gingivalis was evaluated using synthetic chromogenic peptides and fluorogenic substrate. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were stimulated with P. gingivalis in the presence or absence of theaflavins, and then MMP-1, -2 secretion and their mRNA expression were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time PCR analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Theaflavins exhibited the antimicrobial effects against both planktonic culture and biofilm of P. gingivalis. Theaflavins also markedly inhibited the proteinase activities of P. gingivalis collagenase and gingipains in a dose-dependent manner. Lastly, theaflavins significantly inhibited the secretion and mRNA expression of MMP-1 and MMP-2 by HGFs stimulated with P. gingivalis. CONCLUSION: Theaflavins can affect the virulent properties of P. gingivalis and attenuate the MMP-mediated inflammatory response induced by this pathogen, which suggests that theaflavins may be potentially valuable supplementary therapeutic agent for prevention and treatment of P. gingivalis-associated periodontal diseases.",

The translation of these findings into the context of the health of the general public requires detailed information on habitual dietary intake. However, only limited data are currently available for European populations. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed the habitual intake of flavan-3-ol monomers, proanthocyanidins (PA) and theaflavins in the European Union (EU) and determined their main food sources using the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. Data for adults aged 18-64 years were available from fourteen European countries, and intake was determined using the FLAVIOLA Flavanol Food Composition Database, developed for the present study and based on the latest US Department of Agriculture and Phenol-Explorer databases. The mean habitual intake of flavan-3-ol monomers, theaflavins and PA ranged from 181 mg/d (Czech Republic) to 793 mg/d (Ireland). The highest intakes of flavan-3-ol monomers and theaflavins were observed in Ireland (191/505 mg/d) and the lowest intakes in Spain (24/9 mg/d). In contrast, the daily intake of PA was highest in Spain (175 mg/d) and lowest in The Netherlands (96 mg/d). Main sources were tea (62%), pome fruits (11%), berries (3%) and cocoa products (3%). Tea was the major single contributor to monomer intake (75%), followed by pome fruits (6%). Pome fruits were also the main source of PA (28%). The present study provides important data on the population-based intake of flavanols in the EU and demonstrates that dietary intake amounts for flavan-3-ol monomers, PA and theaflavins vary significantly across European countries. The average habitual intake of flavan-3-ols is considerably below the amounts used in most dietary intervention studies.",

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models have become useful tools for identification of promising lead compounds in anticancer drug development. However, epidemiological and clinical studies are still scarce. Compounds with flavonoid scaffold have been the subject of many mechanistic studies in cells, but information on human chemopreventive properties is still missing. The knowledge of the mechanisms of action, anti-multidrug resistance, and QSAR studies on flavonoids and related compounds may help to enhance research on these compounds and their bioactivity. Therefore, once the issue is introduced, the mechanisms involved, and QSAR studies developed to predict the activity and toxicity of these chemicals to biological systems are discussed. QSAR studies on flavonoids as inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), PIM-1 kinase and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are analyzed. Combined treatment of flavonoids with TRAIL and current chemotherapy agents is also discussed as a promising cancer chemoprevention and/or therapy.",

      "abstract": "With phytochemicals executing a plethora of anti-tumor mechanisms, targeting the 'guardian angel' p53 appears to be a critical strategy to energize the process of cancer therapeutics. Regulation of anti-tumor p53 functions by dietary plant polyphenols particularly black tea and its active component theaflavins has gained immense recognition from the point of view of both efficacy and safety. This review highlights the complexities of p53 functions, molecular mechanisms of its inactivation in cancer, and therapeutic strategies for rescuing p53 dysfunction in tumors using theaflavins. It describes how theaflavins, by steering a single molecular target - p53, regulate multiple hallmarks of carcinogenesis i.e., tumor glycolysis, angiogenesis, metastasis, apoptosis and drug resistance. Additionally, considering the rising of the current concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs), the sole participant in tumor evolution, the review discusses about the possible role of theaflavin-p53 cross talk in targeting CSCs. Such attempts to target the complexities of p53 functions during neogenesis will be of immense help in developing a \"new\" strategy for successful cancer prevention and therapy by theaflavins.",

On the 3(rd) day of its administration, indomethacin (18 mg/kg) induced maximum stomach ulceration, which was associated with increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (93.3%, p<0.001), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression (1.6-fold, p<0.001), along with augmented levels of serum nitrite (1.5-fold, p<0.001), selectins and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), as well as reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression (60%, p<0.001). Treatment with BT (40 mg/kg) and TF (1 mg/kg) for 3 days reversed these parameters and provided excellent (78-81%) ulcer healing.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether treatment with theaflavins influences the mucus hypersecretion induced by cigarette smoke in the lungs of experimental rats. Firstly, cigarette smoke was aerosolized using a machine designed for inhalation by rats. The rats were divided into the negative control group, the cigarette smoke inhalation group, the theaflavins (TFs) treatment group, and the TFs +cigarette smoke inhalation group. The animals were sacrificed on day 60 of the experiment. Secondly, the rats were treated with theaflavins at different doses via a gastric tube and sacrificed on day 30. The changes in the levels of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the airway were evaluated. Cigarette smoke induced a significant increase in the levels of MUC5AC and EGFR in all groups. These increases could be reversed by intragastric administration of theaflavins. The effect was more pronounced with the duration of treatment and coincided with a decrease in the expression of both targets. The rats showed various degrees of reduction in the expression of these parameters, which correlated with the theaflavin dose. TFs could inhibit the activation of EGFR, decrease the level of MUC5AC, and relieve airway mucous hypersecretion via the EGFR signaling pathway. These effects correlated directly with the duration of action and the dosage. In the future, oral theaflavins might be valuable in the treatment of chronic airway inflammation.",

Treatment with BT (40 mg/kg), TF (1 mg/kg), and omeprazole (3 mg/kg) produced similar (74%-76%) ulcer healing, as revealed from the histopathological studies. Treatment with all the above samples reversed the adverse oxidative effects of indomethacin significantly.

Results showed the mean lifespan was significantly extended from 51 to 56days upon BTE treatment. Gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2), catalase (CAT), and methuselah (MTH) was characterized by an increase in young and then a decrease in aged fruit flies. Higher gene expression of SOD1 and CAT was observed in the BTE-treated group than the control flies. However, BTE exerted a minimal effect on the expression of SOD2 and MTH genes. Dietary fat could induce oxidative stress and shorten the maximum lifespan to 15days, while addition of 10mg/ml BTE into diet extended it to 28days. Paraquat and H(2)O(2) challenge tests demonstrated that BTE prolonged the survival time only for Oregon-R wild type flies but not for SOD(n108) or Cat(n1) mutants. This suggests that the lifespan-prolonging activity of BTE is mediated at least in part through SOD and CAT.",

Evidence for a cholesterol-lowering benefit of green or black tea consumption from human intervention studies is, however, conflicting and active components responsible for the effect have not yet been clearly identified. AIM OF THE STUDY: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design study the effects of ingesting a purified black tea theaflavins (TFs) powder alone or in combination with catechin (TFs/catechins) on lowering serum total (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) were assessed. METHODS: In total, 102 mildly to moderately hypercholesterolemic (TC and LDL-c: 5.70 +/- 0.74 and 3.97 +/- 0.61 mmol/L, respectively) subjects (67 men and 35 women) were randomly assigned to consume once daily one capsule of one of the 3 treatments: TFs (providing 77.5 mg), TFs/catechins (providing 75.0 mg TFs plus 150.0 mg catechins and 195.0 mg of other polyphenols), or placebo (cellulose). RESULTS: Serum TC and LDL-c concentrations did not differ significantly among the 3 treatments as assessed at 4, 8, and 11 weeks using analysis of covariance (p = 0.1187 and p = 0.1063, respectively). Although changes over time from baseline to week 11 were significant for TC and LDL-c (p = 0.0311 and p = 0.0269, respectively), this decrease over time was seen in the TFs and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: In this human intervention study, no statistically significant LDL-c lowering effect was seen with either TFs alone or the TFs/catechins combination as compared to placebo. Based on these findings it cannot be concluded that tea flavonoids such as theaflavins and catechins are responsible for a putative cholesterol-lowering effect of black tea, at least not with the daily dose applied in the present study.",

METHODS: The cell model of mucous hypersecretion was made by human lung A549 cell stimulated by human neutrophil elastase (HNE), and treated with TFs and AG1478, a blocking agent of EGFR. The expression of mucin (MUC) 5AC, EGFR, P-EGFR, phosphorylation extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (P-ERK1/2), P-p38, phosphorylation c-Jun N-terminal kinase (P-JNK) were detected. The cell activity after TFs treatment was assessed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium method. The cells were divided into 5 groups: a negative control group, an HNE treatment group, a TFs pre-treatment group, an AG1478 pre-treatment group and a TFs + AG1478 group. The changes of MUC5AC mRNA and EGFR mRNA were examined by the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expression changes of EGFR, P-EGFR, P-ERK1/2, P-p38 and P-JNK were measured by Western blot. The protein expression changes of MUC5AC were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the protein morphological changes of MUC5AC were observed by immunofluorescence and confocal laser technology. The data were analyzed with SPSS 12.0 software. Differences between groups were assessed for significance by t test. RESULTS: The expression levels of MUC5AC mRNA and its protein in the HNE group were (0.99 +/- 0.03) and (169 +/- 6) microg/mg, and those of EGFR were (0.98 +/- 0.02) and (0.89 +/- 0.03), both of them increased significantly as compared to those in the control group [(0.53 +/- 0.02), (105 +/- 4) microg/mg and (0.61 +/- 0.11), (0.21 +/- 0.05)]. The protein expressions of P-EGFR, P-ERK1/2, P-p38 were increased significantly as compared with the control group. But the increase of P-p38 was not significant as compared to P-ERK1/2. The protein expression of P-JNK did not change markedly. After the cells were pre-treated with TFs and AG1478 respectively, the above measurements were decreased significantly as compared with the HNE group. The decrease was more significant in the TFs + AG1478 group (t = 3.02, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Theaflavins decreased the level of EGFR and inhibited the activation of EGFR, and attenuated airway mucous hypersecretion via the ERK pathway.",

The order of hydroxyl radicals-scavenging ability was TF3>TF2>TF1>EGCG. The order of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging ability was TF3>TF2>EGCG>TF1. TF1, TF2, and TF3 showed more effective effects than EGCG in protection against H2O2-mediated damage in HPF-1 cells. TF2 was the most potent accelerant of HPF-1 cell proliferation. TF1, TF2 and TF3 suppressed the accumulation of intracellular reactive species in H2O2-mediated damage HPF-1 cells. Pre-treated for 2h and eliminated from the cells, TF1 and TF3 still showed protective effects against H2O2-mediated damage in HPF-1 cells. This suggests that the protective effects of TF1 and TF3 on oxidative damage HPF-1 cells may be responsible for other mechanisms, rather than only scavenging the already formed reactive species. It remains to be determined whether TF1 and TF3 improved the normal HPF-1 cell resistive abilities toward radical-damage in pre-treatment. Further studies of the effects of theaflavins on some enzymes or signal transduction in the normal HPF-1 cells are underway.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCA), the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men, represents an excellent candidate disease for chemoprevention studies because of its particularly long latency period, high rate of mortality and morbidity. Infusion of black tea and its polyphenolic constituents have been shown to possess antineoplastic effects in androgen dependent PCA in both in vivo and in vitro models including transgenic animals. In the present study, we report that black tea polyphenol, Theaflavins (TF)-induced apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma, LNCaP cells is mediated via modulation of two related pathways: up-regulation of p53 and down-regulation of NF-kappa B activity, causing a change in the ratio of pro-and antiapoptotic proteins leading to apoptosis. The altered expression of Bcl-2 family member proteins triggered the release of cytochrome-C and activation of initiator capsase 9 followed by activation of effector caspase 3. Furthermore, TF also affected the protein expression of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways. Our results demonstrated that TF treatment resulted in down-regulation of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk1/2) and phospho-p38 MAPK expressions. We conclude that TF induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells by shifting the balance between pro-and antiapoptotic proteins and down-regulation of cell survival pathways leading to apoptosis. Further extending this work, we also showed that TF induces apoptosis in androgen independent PCA cell line, PC-3 through caspases and MAPKs mediated pathways. Thus, effect of TF on PCA cell lines seems to be irrespective of their androgen status.",

      "abstract": "Dioxins cause various adverse effects through transformation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In this study, we investigated whether black tea extract and its components, theaflavins, suppress AhR transformation in vitro. First, we confirmed that black tea extract strongly suppressed AhR transformation compared to green and oolong tea, although the catechin contents did not change significantly among the extracts. Then we isolated four theaflavins as active compounds from black tea leaves. They suppressed 1 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced AhR transformation in a dose-dependent manner. The IC(50) values of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate, and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (Tfdg) were 4.5, 2.3, 2.2, and 0.7 muM, respectively. The suppressive effect of Tfdg was observed not only by pre-treatment but also by post-treatment. This suggests that theaflavins inhibit the binding of TCDD to the AhR and also the binding of the transformed AhR to the specific DNA-binding site as putative mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The aromatase enzyme, which converts androstenedione to oestrone, regulates the availability of oestrogen to support the growth of hormone-dependent breast tumours. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of black tea polyphenols on aromatase activities. We found that black tea polyphenols, TF-1, TF-2 and TF-3, significantly inhibited rat ovarian and human placental aromatase activities. In addition, using an in vivo model, these black tea polyphenols also inhibited the proliferation induced by 100 nM dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in MCF-7 cells. Transfection of HER2/neu in MCF-7 breast cancer cells appeared to be associated with an increased resistance of the cells to hormonal therapy. Interestingly, unlike the selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen, black tea polyphenols had antiproliferation effects in breast cancer cells with hormonal resistance. The inhibitory effect of black tea polyphenols on hormone-resistant breast cancer cells suppressed the basal receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in HER2/neu-overexpressing MCF-7 cells. These findings suggest the use of black tea polyphenols may be beneficial in the chemoprevention of hormone-dependent breast tumours and represent a possible remedy to overcome hormonal resistance of hormone-independent breast tumours.",

      "abstract": "Among the black tea polyphenols, theaflavins are generally considered to be the more effective components for the inhibition of carcinogenesis. In this study, we attempted to compare the growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activities of the four black tea theaflavins (TF-1, TF-2A, TF-2B and TF-3) with the major green tea catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the murine myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells. All the four black tea theaflavins were shown to exert potent anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects on the leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells in a dose-dependent manner. The observed anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects were in the following order of potency: EGCG > TF-2B > TF-3 > TF-2A > TF-1. In addition, all theaflavins were capable of inducing apoptosis in the leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells. Among the four theaflavins tested, TF-2B and TF-3 were found to be slightly more potent in inducing apoptosis of the WEHI-3B JCS cells than that of TF-2A and TF-1 but were comparable to the major green tea epicatechin EGCG. More interestingly, both TF-2B and TF-3 were found to be much more effective than TF-1 and TF-2B in reducing both the in vitro clonogenicity and in vivo tumorigenicity of the WEHI-3B JCS cells, suggesting that these two black tea theaflavins might represent potential candidates for the treatment of some forms of leukemia.",

Neither theafulvins nor theaflavins influenced cytochrome P450 activity in the liver as exemplified by the O-dealkylations of methoxy-, ethoxy- and pentoxyresorufin, the hydroxylations of lauric acid and p-nitrophenol, and the N-demethylation of erythromycin; similarly, hepatic xenobiotic conjugation systems were unaffected. In the intestine, both polyphenolic fractions markedly suppressed the O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin and this was accompanied by a decrease in the CYP1A1 apoprotein levels. Probing intestinal microsomes with antibodies to CYP2E1 revealed the presence of a single band in the cytochrome P450 region whose intensity was lower in the polyphenol-treated animals. Immunoblot analysis utilising antibodies to CYP3A showed that the treatment with theafulvins and theaflavins reduced the apoprotein levels. A single band in the cytochrome P450 region was evident when the intestinal microsomes were probed with antibodies to CYP4A1 but the level of expression was not affected by the treatment with the black tea polyphenols. Finally, treatment of the rats with theaflavins had no effect on any of the intestinal conjugating enzymes studied, but treatment with theafulvins led to inhibition of glucuronosyl transferase activity.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, numerous reports have been published on the identification of novel, naturally occurring antioxidants from plants, animals, microbial sources and processed food products. Most natural antioxidants are phenolic compounds, which have a modulatory role on physiological functions and biotransformation reactions involved in the detoxification process, thereby affording protection from cytotoxic, genotoxic and metabolic actions of environmental toxicants. As part of our program on evaluation of food, beverage and traditional medicinal plants for their anticarcinogenic activity, the present report deals with the evaluation of aqueous infusion of Black tea (Camellia sinensis), Black tea extract (80% Theaflavins) & EGCG on mice exposed to the chemical carcinogen DMBA. All the four detoxification enzymes studied viz, GST, GPx, SOD and CAT were found to be activated to different degrees following treatment with black tea and two of its active compounds. The activation of the enzymes was accompanied by significant reduction in lipid peroxidation. The effect on apoptosis and cell proliferation was also studied in mice skin following administration of DMBA. Theaflavins, and EGCG significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. The observation suggests chemopreventive potential of black tea infusion, black tea extract Theaflavins and the compound EGCG."

      "abstract": "The present study investigated the inhibitory activity against lung tumorigenesis by a group of characteristic black tea polyphenols, theaflavins. In a short-term study, female A/J mice were treated with a single dose of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK; 103 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) on day 0, and 0.1 and 0.3% theaflavins were administered as the sole source of drinking fluid starting 24 h after NNK treatment. The proliferation index of the lung tissues was measured by the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemically. The highest NNK-induced proliferation rate of bronchiolar cells, observed on day 5, was significantly decreased by 0.3% theaflavins (proliferation index, 1.51 +/- 0.08 versus 2.35 +/- 0.16). In a long-term lung tumorigenesis study, pulmonary adenomas were observed in 100% (30/30) of the mice at week 16 after NNK treatment. Administration of theaflavins (0.1%) as the sole source of drinking fluid, starting 2 days after the NNK treatment until the termination of the experiment, significantly reduced the tumor multiplicity and volume by 23% (8.5 +/- 0.6 versus 6.5 +/- 0.6 tumors/mouse) and 34% (0.08 versus 0.05 mm3 per tumor), respectively. The proliferation index in lung adenomas was also significantly inhibited by theaflavins. The present work demonstrates the inhibitory action of theaflavins against NNK-induced pulmonary hyperproliferation and tumorigenesis.",
