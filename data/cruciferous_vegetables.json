      "abstract": "Cruciferous vegetables of the plant order Brassicales are an attractive dietary component and a valuable source of fiber. However, the nutritional-physiological properties are different when comparing soluble and insoluble fibers. Another significant impact is the transformation of fibers by different influencing factors during food preparation. Cruciferous vegetables, especially, are dominantly processed to soften the matrix. As a result, during cooking, the polysaccharides are dissolved, swelled, or degraded to a certain extent, influencing the composition and the nutritional-physiological properties. The aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of different cooking procedures on changes in the dietary fiber content profile of three different plants: white cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis), broccoli (B. oleracea L. var. italica), and Brussels sprouts (B. oleracea L. var. gemmifera). The sample material was subjected to direct (\"in the water\") and steam cooking. The dietary fiber content and the content of its fractions were determined using an enzymatic analysis method. The results of the research show that the cooking process had a significant influence on the content of dietary fiber fractions in cruciferous vegetables. The concentration of insoluble dietary fiber decreased, whereas the content of soluble dietary fiber increased. When considering the average influence of each process, both steam cooking and direct cooking had a similar impact on changes in the concentrations of dietary fiber fractions. It can therefore be concluded that, when considering dietary fiber content, both processes can be equally well chosen as a thermal treatment for cruciferous vegetables.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract which affects millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advancements in treatment options, there is increasing interest in exploring natural interventions with minimal side effects. Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and radishes, contain bioactive compounds known as glucosinolates (GLSs), which have shown promising effects in alleviating IBD symptoms. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the physiological functions and mechanisms of cruciferous GLSs and their metabolites in the context of IBD. Reviewed studies demonstrated that GLSs attenuated all aspects of IBD, including regulating the intestinal microbiota composition, exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, restoring intestinal barrier function, and regulating epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, a few interventions with GLS supplementation in clinical studies were also discussed. However, there are still several challenges and remaining knowledge gaps, including variations in animals' experimental outcomes, the bioavailability of certain compounds, and few clinical trials to validate their effectiveness in human subjects. Addressing these issues will contribute to a better understanding of the therapeutic potential of cruciferous GLSs and their metabolites in the management of IBD."

      "abstract": "Thyroid is an endocrine gland that is responsible for producing and releasing two hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Hypothyroidism as the disorder happens when the synthesis of those hormones is impaired. It is most commonly caused by the chronic autoimmune inflammation of the thyroid, referred to as Hashimoto’s disease. In this case, apart from the pharmacological treatment, diet does matter a great deal, too. It is extremely important to provide the body with all the essential nutrients. Exclusion of products that may interfere with the uptake of iodine - the trace element that is indispensable for the thyroid gland hormone synthesis, seems to be crucial, too. They most of all include cruciferous vegetables containing goitrogens (goitrogenic substances). This review aimed to collect and summarize the available scientific data on the safety of the cruciferous vegetable consumption within the context of its impact upon the thyroid function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higher cruciferous vegetable intake is associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk in observational studies. The pathways involved remain uncertain. We aimed to determine whether cruciferous vegetable intake (active) lowers 24-h brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP; primary outcome) compared to root and squash vegetables (control) in Australian adults with mildly elevated BP (SBP 120-160 mmHg inclusive). METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, crossover trial, participants completed two 2-week dietary interventions separated by a 2-week washout. Cruciferous vegetables were compared to root and squash vegetables (~ 300 g/day) consumed with lunch and dinner meals. Participants were blinded to which interventions were the active and control. Adherence was assessed using food diaries and biomarkers (S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide (SMCSO, active) and carotenoids (control)). Twenty-four-hour brachial ambulatory SBP and secondary outcomes were assessed pre- and post each intervention. Differences were tested using linear mixed effects regression. RESULTS: Eighteen participants were recruited (median (IQR) age: 68 (66-70); female: n = 16/18; mean ± SD clinic SBP: 135.9 ± 10.0 mmHg). For both interventions, 72% participants had 100% adherence (IQR: 96.4-100%). SMCSO and carotenoids were significantly different between interventions (mean difference active vs. control SMCSO: 22.93 mg/mL, 95%CI 15.62, 30.23, P < 0.0001; carotenoids: - 0.974 mg/mL, 95%CI - 1.525, - 0.423, P = 0.001). Twenty-four-hour brachial SBP was significantly reduced following the active vs. control (mean difference - 2.5 mmHg, 95%CI - 4.2, - 0.9, P = 0.002; active pre: 126.8 ± 12.6 mmHg, post: 124.4 ± 11.8 mmHg; control pre: 125.5 ± 12.1 mmHg, post: 124.8 ± 13.1 mmHg, n = 17), driven by daytime SBP (mean difference - 3.6 mmHg, 95%CI - 5.4, - 1.7, P < 0.001). Serum triglycerides were significantly lower following the active vs. control (mean difference - 0.2 mmol/L, 95%CI - 0.4, - 0.0, P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Increased intake of cruciferous vegetables resulted in reduced SBP compared to root and squash vegetables. Future research is needed to determine whether targeted recommendations for increasing cruciferous vegetable intake benefits population health.

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition with a significant economic and social burden. The disease is complex and challenging to treat because it involves several pathologies, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, dysbiosis, and intestinal damage. The search for an effective treatment has identified cruciferous vegetables and their phytochemicals as potential management options for inflammatory bowel disease because they contain prebiotics, probiotics, and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant metabolites essential for a healthy gut. This critical narrative style review provides a robust insight into the pharmacological effects and benefits of crucifers and their documented bioactive compounds in in vitro and in vivo models, as well as clinical inflammatory bowel disease. The review highlights the significant impact of crucifer preparation and the presence of glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, flavonoids, and polyphenolic compounds, which are essential for the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative benefits of cruciferous vegetables, as well as their ability to promote the healthy microbial community and maintain the intestinal barrier. This review may serve as a viable nutritional guide for future research on methods and features essential to developing experiments, preventions, and treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. There is limited clinical information and future research may utilize current innovative tools, such as metabolomics, for adequate knowledge and effective translation into clinical therapy."

      "abstract": "Neurological disorders incidences are increasing drastically due to complex pathophysiology, and the nonavailability of disease-modifying agents. Several attempts have been made to identify new potential chemicals to combat these neurological abnormalities. At present, complete abolishment of neurological diseases is not attainable except for symptomatic relief. However, dietary recommendations to help brain development or improvement have increased over the years. In recent times, cruciferous vegetables and their phytochemicals have been identified from preclinical and clinical investigations as potential neuroprotective agents. The present review highlights the beneficial effects and molecular mechanisms of phytochemicals such as indole-3-carbinol, diindolylmethane, sulforaphane, kaempferol, selenium, lutein, zeaxanthin, and vitamins of cruciferous vegetables against neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Huntington's disease, autism spectra disorders, anxiety, depression, and pain. Most of these cruciferous phytochemicals protect the brain by eliciting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. Regular dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables may benefit the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. The present review suggests that there is a lacuna in identifying the clinical efficacy of these phytochemicals. Therefore, high-quality future studies should firmly establish the efficacy of the above-mentioned cruciferous phytochemicals in clinical settings.",

As such, greater understanding of their measurements within foods is important to estimate intake in humans and to inform dietary intervention studies. Herein is described a simple and sensitive method for simultaneous analysis of 20 GLS, SFN and SMCSO by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Analytes were effectively retained and resolved on an Xbridge C18 column. Detection can be achieved using high resolution or unit resolution mass spectrometry; the latter making the method more applicable to large studies. Quantitative analysis using calibration standards was demonstrated for 10 GLS, SFN and SMCSO. A further 10 GLS were tentatively identified using high resolution mass spectrometry. The use of surrogate GLS standards was shown to be unreliable, with closely related GLS displaying significantly different ionisation efficiencies."

Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may be essential in the production of these compounds; however, the relationship between specific microbes and the abundance of metabolites produced during cruciferous vegetable digestion are still unclear. We utilized an ex vivo human fecal incubation model with in vitro digested broccoli sprouts (Broc), Brussels sprouts (Brus), a combination of the two vegetables (Combo), or a negative control (NC) to investigate microbial metabolites of cruciferous vegetables. We conducted untargeted metabolomics on the fecal cultures by LC-MS/MS and completed 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We identified 72 microbial genera in our samples, 29 of which were significantly differentially abundant between treatment groups. A total of 4499 metabolomic features were found to be significantly different between treatment groups (q ≤ 0.05, fold change > 2). Chemical enrichment analysis revealed 45 classes of compounds to be significantly enriched by brassicas, including long-chain fatty acids, coumaric acids, and peptides. Multi-block PLS-DA and a filtering method were used to identify microbe−metabolite interactions. We identified 373 metabolites from brassica, which had strong relationships with microbes, such as members of the family Clostridiaceae and genus Intestinibacter, that may be microbially derived.",

      "abstract": "Malignant glioma is the most fatal, invasive brain cancer with limited treatment options. Our previous studies show that 2-(indol-3-ylmethyl)-3,3'-diindolylmethane (LTr1), a major metabolite of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) derived from cruciferous vegetables, produces anti-tumour effect against various tumour cell lines. In this study we characterized LTr1 as a novel anti-glioma agent. Based on screening 134 natural compounds and comparing the candidates' efficacy and toxicity, LTr1 was selected as the lead compound. We showed that LTr1 potently inhibited the viability of human glioma cell lines (SHG-44, U87, and U251) with IC50 values of 1.97, 1.84, and 2.03 μM, respectively. Furthermore, administration of LTr1 (100,300 mg· kg-1 ·d-1, i.g. for 18 days) dose-dependently suppressed the tumour growth in a U87 xenograft nude mouse model. We demonstrated that LTr1 directly bound with TrkA to inhibit its kinase activity and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway thus inducing significant S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SHG-44 and U87 cells by activating the mitochondrial pathway and inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, LTr1 could cross the blood-brain barrier to achieve the therapeutic concentration in the brain. Taken together, LTr1 is a safe and promising therapeutic agent against glioma through inhibiting TrkA/PI3K/AKT pathway.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, phytochemicals from natural products have gotten the boundless praise in treating cancer. The promising role of cruciferous vegetables and active components contained in these vegetables, such as isothiocyanates, indole-3-carbinol, and isothiocyanates, has been widely researched in experimental in vitro and in vivo carcinogenesis models. The chemopreventive agents produced from the cruciferous vegetables were recurrently proven to affect carcinogenesis throughout the onset and developmental phases of cancer formation. Likewise, findings from clinical investigations and epidemiological research supported this statement. The anticancer activities of these functional foods bioactive compounds are closely related to their ability to upregulate p53 and its related target genes, e.g., p21. As the \"guardian of the genome,\" the p53 family (p53, p63, and p73) plays a pivotal role in preventing the cancer progression associated with DNA damage. This review discusses the functional foods bioactive compounds derived from several cruciferous vegetables and their use in altering the tumor-suppressive effect of p53 proteins. The association between the mutation of p53 and the incidence of gastrointestinal malignancies (gastric, small intestine, colon, liver, and pancreatic cancers) is also discussed. This review contains crucial information about the use of cruciferous vegetables in the treatment of gastrointestinal tract malignancies."

      "abstract": "The Brassicaceae family, known as cruciferous vegetables, includes many economically important species, mainly edible oil plants, vegetable species, spice plants, and feed plants. Cruciferous vegetables are foods rich in nutritive composition and are also a good source of dietary fiber. Besides, cruciferous vegetables contain various bioactive chemicals known as glucosinolates and S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, including sulphur-containing cancer-protective chemicals. Numerous studies have reported that daily intake of sulphurous vegetables helps prevent cancer formation and reduces cancer incidence, especially in colorectal cancer, through various mechanisms. The potential mechanisms of these compounds in preventing cancer in experimental studies are as follows: protecting cells against DNA damage, inactivating carcinogenic substances, showing antiviral and antibacterial effects, triggering apoptosis in cells with disrupted structure, inhibiting tumour cell migration causing metastasis and the development of tumour-feeding vessels (angiogenesis). These beneficial anticancer effects of cruciferous vegetables are generally associated with glucosinolates in their composition and some secondary metabolites, as well as other phenolic compounds, seed oils, and dietary fiber in the literature. This review aims to examine to the roles of cruciferous vegetables and their important bioactive metabolites in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer."

Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed GI cancers and currently stands in second place regarding cancer-related mortality. Unfortunately, the treatment of GI is limited, and few developments have occurred in the field over the years. With this in mind, new therapeutic strategies involving biologically active phytocompounds are being evaluated as anti-cancer agents. Vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, and radish, all belonging to the Brassicaceae family, are high in dietary fibre, minerals, vitamins, carotenoids, polyphenols, and glucosinolates. The latter compound is a secondary metabolite characteristic of this family and, when biologically active, has demonstrated anti-cancer properties. This article reviews the literature regarding the potential of Cruciferous vegetables in the prevention and/or treatment of GI cancers and the relevance of appropriate compound formulations for improving the stability and bioaccessibility of the major Cruciferous compounds, with a particular focus on glucosinolates."

Patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) present with high levels of oxidative stress and a massive inflammatory burden associated with diminished Nrf2 and elevated nuclear transcription factor-κB-κB expression. Because it is a common constituent of dietary vegetables, the salutogenic properties of sulforaphane, especially it's antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, have been explored as a nutritional intervention in a range of diseases of ageing, though data on CKD remain scarce. In this brief review, the effects of SFN as a senotherapeutic agent are described and a rationale is provided for studies that aim to explore the potential benefits of SFN-rich foods in patients with CKD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of cruciferous vegetable intake on breast cancer survival is controversial at present. Glucosinolates are the naturally occurring constituents found across the cruciferous vegetables. Isothiocyanates are produced from the hydrolysis of glucosinolates and this reaction is catalysed by the plant-derived enzyme myrosinase. The main Isothiocyanates (ITCs) from cruciferous vegetables are sulforaphane, benzyl ITC, and phenethyl ITC, which had been intensively investigated over the last decade for their anti-breast cancer effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to systematically review the evidence from all types of studies, which examined the protective effect of cruciferous vegetables and/or their isothiocyanate constituents on breast cancer. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in Pubmed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 27 April 2020. Peer-reviewed studies of all types (in vitro studies, animal studies, and human studies) were selected. RESULTS: The systematic literature search identified 16 human studies, 4 animal studies, and 65 in vitro studies. The effect of cruciferous vegetables and/or their ITCs intake on breast cancer survival was found to be controversial and varied greatly across human studies. Most of these trials were observational studies conducted in specific regions, mainly in the US and China. Substantial evidence from in vitro and animal studies was obtained, which strongly supported the protective effect of sulforaphane and other ITCs against breast cancer. Evidence from in vitro studies showed that sulforaphane and other ITCs reduced cancer cell viability and proliferation via multiple mechanisms and pathways. Isothiocyanates inhibited cell cycle, angiogenesis and epithelial mesenchymal transition, as well as induced apoptosis and altered the expression of phase II carcinogen detoxifying enzymes. These are the essential pathways that promote the growth and metastasis of breast cancer. Noticeably, benzyl ITC showed a significant inhibitory effect on breast cancer stem cells, a new dimension of chemo-resistance in breast cancer treatment. Sulforaphane and other ITCs displayed anti-breast cancer effects at variable range of concentrations and benzyl isothiocyanate appeared to have a relatively lower inhibitory concentration IC50. The mechanisms underlying the cancer protective effect of sulforaphane and other ITCs have also been highlighted in this article. CONCLUSION: Current preclinical evidence strongly supports the role of sulforaphane and other ITCs as potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer, either as adjunct therapy or combined therapy with current anti-breast cancer drugs, with sulforaphane displaying the greatest potential.",

However, these therapies often show severe adverse events, and prolongation of survival is unsatisfactory. Therefore, a treatment strategy using natural compounds is of great interest. In this review, we focused on the anti-cancer effects of isothiocyanates (ITCs) derived from cruciferous vegetables, which are widely cultivated and consumed in many regions worldwide. Specifically, we discuss the anti-cancer effects of four ITC compounds-allyl isothiocyanate, benzyl isothiocyanate, sulforaphane, and phenethyl isothiocyanate-in BC; the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer effects; current trends and future direction of ITC-based treatment strategies; and the carcinogenic potential of ITCs. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of each ITC in BC treatment, furthering the consideration of ITCs in treatment strategies and for improving the prognosis of patients with BC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: GSTM1 encodes glutathione S-transferase μ-1 (GSTM1), which belongs to a superfamily of phase 2 antioxidant enzymes. The highly prevalent GSTM1 deletion variant is associated with kidney disease progression in human cohorts: the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. METHODS: We generated a Gstm1 knockout mouse line to study its role in a CKD model (involving subtotal nephrectomy) and a hypertension model (induced by angiotensin II). We examined the effect of intake of cruciferous vegetables and GSTM1 genotypes on kidney disease in mice as well as in human ARIC study participants. We also examined the importance of superoxide in the mediating pathways and of hematopoietic GSTM1 on renal inflammation. RESULTS: Gstm1 knockout mice displayed increased oxidative stress, kidney injury, and inflammation in both models. The central mechanism for kidney injury is likely mediated by oxidative stress, because treatment with Tempol, an superoxide dismutase mimetic, rescued kidney injury in knockout mice without lowering BP. Bone marrow crosstransplantation revealed that Gstm1 deletion in the parenchyma, and not in bone marrow-derived cells, drives renal inflammation. Furthermore, supplementation with cruciferous broccoli powder rich in the precursor to antioxidant-activating sulforaphane significantly ameliorated kidney injury in Gstm1 knockout, but not wild-type mice. Similarly, among humans (ARIC study participants), high consumption of cruciferous vegetables was associated with fewer kidney failure events compared with low consumption, but this association was observed primarily in participants homozygous for the GSTM1 deletion variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a role for the GSTM1 enzyme in the modulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and protective metabolites in CKD.",

Although not yet fully understood, many mechanisms of anticancer activity at each step of cancer development have been attributed to this ITC. Given the promising data available regarding SFN, this review aimed to provide an overview on the potential activities of SFN related to the cellular mechanisms involved in glioblastoma (GBM) progression. GBM is the most frequent malignant brain tumor among adults and is currently an incurable disease due mostly to its highly invasive phenotype, and the poor efficacy of the available therapies. Despite all efforts, the median overall survival of GBM patients remains approximately 1.5 years under therapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide support for translating the progress in understanding the molecular background of GBM into more complex, but promising therapeutic strategies, in which SFN may find a leading role.",

      "abstract": "Bladder cancer is a significant health burden due to its high prevalence, risk of mortality, morbidity, and high cost of medical care. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, particularly broccoli, are associated with lower bladder cancer risk. Phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables, such as glucosinolates, which are enzymatically hydrolyzed to bioactive isothiocyanates, are possible mediators of an anticancer effect. In vitro studies have shown inhibition of bladder cancer cell lines, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis by these isothiocyanates, in particular sulforaphane and erucin. Although not yet completely understood, many mechanisms of anticancer activity at the steps of cancer initiation, promotion, and progression have been attributed to these isothiocyanates. They target multiple pathways including the adaptive stress response, phase I/II enzyme modulation, pro-growth, pro-survival, pro-inflammatory signaling, angiogenesis, and even epigenetic modulation. Multiple in vivo studies have shown the bioavailability of isothiocyanates and their antitumoral effects. Although human studies are limited, they support oral bioavailability with reasonable plasma and urine concentrations achieved. Overall, both cell and animal studies support a potential role for isothiocyanates in bladder cancer prevention and treatment. Future studies are necessary to examine clinically relevant outcomes and define guidelines on ameliorating the bladder cancer burden.",

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 192 CA and 173 NHW female breast cancer survivors (stages 0-III, diagnosed between 2006 and 2012) recruited from two California cancer registries, who had completed primary treatment. Patient-reported data on treatment-related symptoms and potential covariates were collected via telephone interviews. Dietary data were ascertained by mailed questionnaires. The outcomes evaluated were menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, vaginal discharge), joint problems, fatigue, hair thinning/loss, and memory problems. Associations between soy and cruciferous vegetables and symptoms were assessed using logistic regression. Analyses were further stratified by race/ethnicity and endocrine therapy usage (non-user, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors). RESULTS: Soy food and cruciferous vegetable intake ranged from no intake to 431 and 865 g/day, respectively, and was higher in CA survivors. Higher soy food intake was associated with lower odds of menopausal symptoms (≥ 24.0 vs. 0 g/day, OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25, 1.03), and fatigue (≥ 24.0 vs. 0 g/day, OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22, 0.84). However, when stratified by race/ethnicity, associations were statistically significant in NHW survivors only. Compared with low intake, higher cruciferous vegetable intake was associated with lower odds of experiencing menopausal symptoms (≥ 70.8 vs. < 33.0 g/day, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25, 0.97) in the overall population. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of breast cancer survivors, higher soy and cruciferous vegetable intake was associated with less treatment-related menopausal symptoms and fatigue.",

Several common plant-based dietary components exert effects on DNA methylation levels, and can positively influence genome stability and the transcription of tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a substance present in vegetables of the Brassicaeae family, especially broccoli, white cabbage, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower. The in vivo biological effects of I3C are ascribed to a series of oligomeric products (including 3,3'-diindolylmethane), developed under acidic conditions. I3C is one of the many natural products and bioactive compounds found in foods which have recently received much attention for its potential effects in cancer prevention and treatment. In vitro studies report that I3C suppresses the proliferation of different tumor cells, including those isolated from breast, prostate, endometrium, and colon cancers. I3C resulted to be a potent in vivo chemopreventive agent for certain hormone-dependent cancers, including breast and cervical cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well defined. In this review, we have analysed recent literature on the use of indole derivatives against various forms of cancer, and have identified the main signalling pathways involved in their anti-cancer effect as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables modulate signaling pathways critical to carcinogenesis, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), a central regulator of inflammation. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTT1 metabolize isothiocyanates; genetic variants may result in differences in biologic response. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test whether consumption of cruciferous or cruciferous plus apiaceous vegetables altered serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, and soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) I and II, and whether this response was GSTM1/GSTT1 genotype dependent. METHODS: In a randomized crossover trial, healthy men (n = 32) and women (n = 31) aged 20-40 y consumed 4 14-d controlled diets: basal (vegetable-free), single-dose cruciferous (1xC) [7 g vegetables/kg body weight (BW)], double-dose cruciferous (2xC) (14 g/kg BW), and cruciferous plus apiaceous (carrot family) (1xC+A) vegetables (7 and 4 g/kg BW, respectively), with a 21-d washout period between each intervention. Urinary isothiocyanate excretion was also evaluated as a marker of systemic isothiocyanate exposure. Fasting morning blood and urine samples were collected on days 0 and 14 and analyzed. RESULTS: IL-6 concentrations were significantly lower on day 14 of the 2xC and 1xC+A diets than with the basal diet [-19% (95% CI: -30%, -0.1%) and -20% (95% CI: -31%, -0.7%), respectively]. IL-8 concentrations were higher after the 1xC+A diet (+16%; 95% CI: 4.2%, 35.2%) than after the basal diet. There were no effects of diet on CRP, TNF-α, or sTNFRI or II. There were significant differences between GSTM1-null/GSTT1+ individuals for several biomarkers in response to 1xC+A compared with basal diets (CRP: -37.8%; 95% CI: -58.0%, -7.4%; IL-6: -48.6%; 95% CI: -49.6%, -12.0%; IL-8: 16.3%; 95% CI: 6.7%, 57.7%) and with the 2xC diet compared with the basal diet (IL-8: -33.2%; 95% CI: -43.0%, -1.4%; sTNFRI: -7.5%; 95% CI: -12.7%, -2.3%). There were no significant reductions in biomarker concentrations in response to diet among GSTM1+/GSTT1+ or GSTM1-null/GSTT1-null individuals. Twenty-four-hour urinary isothiocyanate excretion was not associated with any of the inflammation markers overall; however, IL-6 was inversely associated with total isothiocyanate excretion in GSTM1-null/GSTT1-null individuals (β = -0.12; 95% CI: -0.19, -0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this young, healthy population, consumption of cruciferous and apiaceous vegetables reduced circulating IL-6; however, results for other biomarkers of inflammation were not consistent.",

      "abstract": "L-sulforaphane (LSF) is a natural isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables particularly broccoli. LSF has been identified as a potent antioxidant and anti-cancer agent and is widely known to regulate phase II detoxifying enzymes and induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in malignant cells in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have found significant G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to LSF in various model of cancer and results have mainly been attributed to increased cyclin B1 protein levels and increased p21expression. Using genome-wide mRNA-Seq analysis we provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of LSF to identify a key pathway in cell cycle progression - the role of the anaphase promoting complex (APC) pathway. We evaluated gene expression changes in human erythroleukemic K562 cells following treatment with 15 μM LSF for 48h and compared them to immortalized human keratinocytes, human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) cells and normal human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC). We identified disparate gene expression changes in response to LSF between malignant and normal cells and immortalized cell lines. The results highlight significant down-regulation of kinase CDK1 which is suggestive that the existence and activity of APC/CDC20 complex will be inhibited along with its associated down-stream degradation of key cell cycle regulators preventing cell cycle progression from mitotic exit."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: During implantation, human trophoblastic cells have to proliferate, migrate and invade pregnant uterus. A natural product of cruciferous vegetables, 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), is known to induce some stress response genes (such as glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78)) and to have anti-invasive and pro-apoptotic effects on tumor cells. Therefore, we have investigated the potential effect of DIM on invasive extravillous cytotrophoblasts (evCTBs) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: evCTBs were purified from first trimester trophoblasts and cultured in presence or not of DIM for 48h. In order to evaluate invasive properties of cells, they were seeded on collagen-coated insert following boyden chamber principle and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and GRP78 expression was evaluated by qPCR. RESULTS: We showed that DIM decreases (p=0.013) invasive properties of evCTBs. In parallel, we determined that MMP-2, -7 and -9 which are involved in evCTBs invasion and known to be regulated by DIM, are not affected by DIM in evCTBs. In contrast, MMP-1 mRNA is induced (p=0.03) and MMP-12 is decreased (p=0.01) in DIM treated cells. Moreover, DIM treatment does not affect GRP78 mRNA expression in evCTBs. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the present results provide evidence that DIM does not impact evenly on evCTBs and cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Changes in DNA methylation patterns are a hallmark of tobacco-induced carcinogenesis. We have conducted a randomized 4-week intervention trial to investigate the effects of three dietary regimens to modify DNA methylation patterns in peripheral white blood cells of heavy smokers. A group of 88 smokers were randomly assigned to and distributed among three diets, including (1) normal isocaloric diet (balanced in fruits and vegetables), according to international guidelines; (2) a diet enriched in flavonoids and isothiocyanates (particularly cruciferous vegetables); (3) a regimen consisting of diet 1 supplemented with flavonoids (green tea and soy products). Methylation patterns were analyzed by pyrosequencing in LINE1 (Long Interspersed DNA Elements), RASSF1A, ARF and CDKN2a (tumor suppressor genes), MLH1 (mismatch DNA repair) and MTHFR (folate metabolism). Three distinct patterns of methylation were observed. In LINE1, methylation showed a small but reproducible increase with all three regimens. MTHFR was constitutively methylated with no significant modulation by diets. The four other loci showed low basal levels of methylation with no substantial change after intervention. These data suggest that the isocaloric diet may stabilize global epigenetic (LINE1 DNA methylation) patterns in peripheral white blood cells but does not provide evidence for methylation changes in specific genes associated with this short-term dietary intervention.",

The present study examined the apoptotic effects of PEITC and its molecular mechanism in human cervical cancer cell lines (HEp-2 and KB). PEITC induced apoptosis to inhibit cell proliferation. According to the protein chip assay, PEITC increased the expression of the death receptors (DR4 and DR5) and cleaved caspase-3 compared to the DMSO treatment group. PEITC also induced caspase-8 and truncated BID. PEITC down-regulated the phosphorylation of extracellular-related kinase (ERK)1/2, whereas neither phospho-c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNK) nor phospho-p38 MAPK was changed. The role of ERK in PEITC-induced apoptosis was also investigated using MEK inhibitor (PD98059). PD98059 increased the expression of DR4 and DR5, activated caspase-3, and cleaved PARP. In addition, PEITC decreased the phosphorylation of MEK. Therefore, the apoptotic mechanism of PEITC in cervical cancer cells involves the induction of DR4 and DR5 through the inactivation of ERK and MEK.",

      "abstract": "Chemical carcinogens derived from cigarettes and other tobacco products, as well as betel quid, paan, and alcohol consumption, are commonly associated with head and neck cancer risk. This is a particularly debilitating cancer, with a high recurrence rate and long-term treatment comorbidities affecting health and lifestyle. Controlling tobacco access or use may be an ideal prevention strategy but may also be challenging or undesired. Individuals, however, may be able to reduce their risk through simple and focused dietary change. Results from epidemiologic studies, basic research, and clinical investigations suggest that a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables may increase carcinogen metabolism, induce apoptosis, and reduce the risk of developing a primary head and neck tumor. This review briefly summarizes head and neck cancer nutritional epidemiology, and then describes the biochemical and epidemiologic literature describing the effects of crucifer consumption on head and neck carcinogenesis. To translate these findings, the strengths and limitations of specific intervention models are discussed, including differences in target populations and the choice of a food-based or pill-based approach for intervention. Addressing these factors in a future intervention may define a low-cost and non-toxic approach to reduce the burden of head and neck cancer.",

      "abstract": "Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a constituent of many edible cruciferous vegetables, exerts significant protection against chemically induced cancer in animal models and inhibits growth of cancer cells in culture and in vivo by causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. In this study, we report a novel response to PEITC involving the regulation of translation initiation at pharmacologically achievable concentrations. Treatment of human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells and human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, but not a normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC), with PEITC caused an increase in expression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein (4E-BP1) and inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Results from pull-down assay using 7-methyl-GTP Sepharose 4B beads indicated that PEITC treatment reduced cap-bound eIF4E, confirming that increased 4E-BP1 expression and inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation indeed reduced the availability of eIF4E for translation initiation. Accordingly, results from in vivo translation using luciferase reporter assay indicated that PEITC treatment inhibited cap-dependent translation, in particular the translation of mRNA with secondary structure (stem-loop structure). Ectopic expression of eIF4E prevented PEITC-induced translation inhibition and conferred significant protection against PEITC-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that PEITC modulates availability of eIF4E for translation initiation leading to inhibition of cap-dependent translation. The present study also suggests that inhibition of cap-dependent translation may be an important mechanism in PEITC-induced apoptosis.",

The results showed that I3C inhibited the growth of EA hy926 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The capillary-like tube formation by PMA-activated endothelial cells was significantly suppressed by I3C, and such inhibition was associated with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion, but not with the expression of VEGF receptor-2 protein. Additionally, gelatin zymography analysis indicated that I3C suppressed activities of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 stimulated by PMA.

      "abstract": "Epidemiological surveys indicate that intake of cruciferous vegetables is inversely related to prostate cancer incidence, although the responsible dietary factors have not been identified. Our studies demonstrated that exposure of human prostate cancer cells in culture to the N-acetylcysteine (NAC) conjugate of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC-NAC), the major metabolite of PEITC that is abundant in watercress, inhibited proliferation and tumorigenesis. The PEITC-NAC is known to mediate cytoprotection at initiation of carcinogenesis. The relevance of PEITC-NAC in diets on the growth of prostate tumor cells has been evaluated in immunodeficient mice with xenografted tumors of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. The daily PEITC-NAC (8 micromol/g) supplemented diet group showed a significant reduction in tumor size in 100% of the mice during the 9-week treatment period. Tumor weight at autopsy was reduced by 50% compared with mice on the diet without PEITC-NAC (P = 0.05). Mitosis and in vivo 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeled proliferating cells were reduced in these tumors. The PEITC-NAC diet up-regulated the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases p21WAF-1/Cip-1 and p27Kip1, and reduced the expression of cyclins D and E, indicating they were potential molecular targets. As a result, phosphorylated Rb was significantly decreased and the G1- to S-phase transition retarded. The treated tumors also showed a significant increase in apoptosis as determined by in situ end-labeling, and by poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage. This study demonstrates the first in vivo evidence of dietary PEITC-NAC inhibiting tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells. PEITC-NAC may prevent initiation of carcinogenesis and modulate the post-initiation phase by targeting cell cycle regulators and apoptosis induction.",

On the basis of gaschromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses, allylnitrile generation was observed in eight out of twelve vegetables, broccoli, broccoli (young stems and leaves), brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, chinese cabbage, komatsuna and kaiware-daikon (young stems and leaves). The daily dietary intake of allylnitrile was estimated to be at least 0.12 micromol/kg body weight for Japanese, based on its generation from the vegetables, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and Chinese cabbage and their daily dietary consumption. Mice received oral doses of 2, 20, 200, 500 and 1,100 micromol/kg allylnitrile once a day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks. Mice in the lower dosage groups of 2, 20 and 200 micromol/kg exhibited no behavioral changes. Mice dosed at the level of 500 micromol/kg showed restlessness, and one of them displayed alteration in tail hanging. These abnormalities were seen around seven days following the beginning of the treatment period. Animals in the highest dosage group elicited behavioral abnormalities, and their degree increased with increasing dosage. These results suggest that allylnitrile intake levels through daily vegetable consumption is below the level producing behavioral abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "Dietary isothiocyanates (ITCs) are highly effective in affording protection against chemically induced cancers in laboratory animals. In the present study, we demonstrate that allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a constituent of cruciferous vegetables, significantly inhibits proliferation of cultured PC-3 (androgen-independent) and LNCaP (androgen-dependent) human prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) of approximately 15-17 micro M. On the other hand, survival of a normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC) was minimally affected by AITC even at concentrations that were highly cytotoxic to the prostate cancer cells. Reduced proliferation of PC-3 as well as LNCaP cells in the presence of AITC correlated with accumulation of cells in G(2)/M phase and induction of apoptosis. In contrast, AITC treatment failed to induce apoptosis or cause G(2)/M phase arrest in PrEC cells. A 24 h treatment of PC-3 and LNCaP cells with 20 micro M AITC caused a significant decrease in the levels of proteins that regulate G(2)/M progression, including Cdk1 (32-50% reduction), Cdc25B (44-48% reduction) and Cdc25C (>90% reduction). A significant reduction in the expression of cyclin B1 protein (approximately 45%) was observed only in LNCaP cells. A 24 h exposure of PC-3 and LNCaP cells to an apoptosis-inducing concentration of AITC (20 micro M) resulted in a significant decrease (31-68%) in the levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in both cell lines, and approximately 58% reduction in Bcl-X(L) protein expression in LNCaP cells. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that AITC, and possibly other ITCs, may find use in the treatment of human prostate cancers.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the chemopreventive effects of widely consumed cruciferous vegetables, namely Brussels sprouts and red cabbage towards 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ)-induced preneoplastic lesions [liver glutathione-S-transferase placental positive (GST-P(+)) foci and colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF)]. Male F344 rats were treated with IQ (100 mg/kg bw/g) on 10 alternating days and received drinking water supplemented with Brussels sprouts and red cabbage juices (5% v/v) before and during the carcinogen treatment. From each vegetable two different cultivars were tested. Brussels sprouts reduced the frequency of IQ-induced aberrant foci in both organs (41-52% in the colon and 27-67% in the liver). Also, Brussels sprouts drastically diminished (85-91%) the size of liver GST-P(+) foci, but no such effect was seen in the colon. With red cabbage, the size of liver GST-P(+) foci was markedly reduced (41-83%) whereas the foci frequency was only moderately decreased (19-50%). No protection was seen in the colon after treatment with red cabbage. Cooking (10 min, 100 degrees C) of the vegetables had no influence on their protective effects. The stronger chemoprotective effects of Brussels sprouts may be due to the fact that the overall glucosinolate contents were substantially (2-3-fold) higher than those of the cabbage cultivars, but it was not possible to attribute the reduction of preneoplastic lesions to specific glucosinolates. The activities of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase form 2 (UDPGT-2) and cytochrome P4501A2 were increased by both vegetables. The induction effect of Brussels sprouts on the activity of UDPGT-2 was more marked than that of the red cabbage cultivars, suggesting that increased glucuronidation of IQ may account for the reduction of the preneoplastic lesions. Our findings support the assumption that Brassica vegetables protect against the carcinogenic effects of heterocyclic amines.",

It is now shown that DIM, ICZ, SUL, and BITC can each stimulate apoptosis in human colon adenocarcinoma LS-174 and Caco-2 cells. Treatment of LS-174 cells with nontoxic doses of DIM, ASG, I3C, or ICZ affected an increase of up to 21-fold in cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). None of these indoles caused an elevation in either aldo-keto reductase 1C1 (AKR1C1) or the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit (GCS(h)), but DIM, I3C, and ICZ produced a very modest increase in NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). By contrast, nontoxic doses of SUL, BITC, or PEITC failed to induce expression of CYP1A1 in LS-174 cells, but caused an increase of between 11- and 17-fold in the protein levels of AKR1C1, NQO1, and GCS(h). Treatment of the colon cell line with ICZ or SUL caused increases in the levels of mRNA for CYP1A1, AKR1C1, and NQO1 that were consistent with the enzyme data. Exposure of Caco-2 cells to media containing indoles or isothiocyanates gave similar results to those obtained using LS-174 cells. Evidence is presented that the ability of indoles and isothiocyanates to stimulate either xenobiotic response element- or antioxidant response element-driven gene expression accounts for the two groups of phytochemicals inducing different gene batteries. Pretreatment of LS-174 cells for 24 h with ICZ and SUL before exposure for 24 h to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) reduced to <20% the number of single-strand DNA breaks produced by the carcinogen. Neither ICZ alone nor SUL alone were able to confer the same degree of protection against DNA damage produced by BaP as they achieved in combination. Similar results were obtained with H(2)O(2) as the genotoxic agent. Together, these phytochemicals may prevent colon tumorigenesis by both stimulating apoptosis and enhancing intracellular defenses against genotoxic agents.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies give evidence that cruciferous vegetables (CF) protect humans against cancer, and also results from animal experiments show that they reduce chemically induced tumor formation. These properties have been attributed to alterations in the metabolism of carcinogens by breakdown products of glucosinolates, which are constituents of CF. The present article gives an overview on the present state of knowledge on the impact of CF and their constituents on enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of DNA-reactive carcinogens. The development of in vitro models with metabolically competent cell lines led to the detection of potent enzyme inducers contained in CF such as sulforaphane. Recently, we showed that Brassica juices induce glutathione-S-transferases (GST) and cytochrome P-450 1A2 in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and protect against the genotoxic effects of B(a)P and other carcinogens. Earlier in vivo experiments with rodents indicated that indoles and isothiocyanates, two major groups of glucosinolate breakdown products, attenuate the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines via induction of GST and inhibition of cytochrome-P450 isoenzymes, respectively. Our own investigations showed that CF are also protective towards heterocyclic amines (HAs): Brussels sprouts- and garden cress juices attenuated IQ-induced DNA-damage and preneoplastic lesions in colon and liver of rats. These effects were paralleled by induction of uridine-di-phospho-glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT) which is very probably the mechanism of protection against HAs by cruciferous vegetables. There is also evidence that consumption of CF might protect humans against cancer. In matched control intervention studies with these vegetables, it was shown that they induce GST-activities in humans but overall, results were inconclusive. Recently, we carried out crossover intervention studies and found pronounced GST-induction upon consumption of Brussels sprouts and red cabbage, whereas no effects were seen with white cabbage and broccoli. Furthermore, we found that the isoenzyme induced was GST-pi which plays an important role in protection against breast, bladder, colon and testicular cancer. No induction of the GST-alpha isoform could be detected. Urinary mutagenicity experiments gave further evidence that CF affect drug metabolism in humans. Consumption of red cabbage led to changes in the pattern of meat-derived urinary mutagenicity. Overall, CF are among the most promising chemopreventive dietary constituents and further elucidation of their protective mechanisms and the identification of active constituents may contribute to the development of highly protective Brassica varieties.",

The inhibition by PEITC is due largely to its inhibitory effect on the enzymes of NNK metabolism, whereas; the inhibition by I3C may be attributed to its ability to induce hepatic enzyme activity of NNK metabolism, which resulted in decreased availability of NNK to the lung. On a molar basis, PEITC is considerably more effective than I3C. PEITC was released upon consumption of watercress. The N-acetylcysteine conjugate of PEITC is a promising urinary marker for quantitating uptake of this dietary anticarcinogen in humans. These studies also showed that green tea polyphenol EGCG inhibited the NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis, probably due to its antioxidant property. These studies provide for the first time evidence for the involvement of free radicals in nitrosamine tumorigenesis. The mechanism by which free radicals are generated by NNK treatment is not yet known. The reduced levels of oxidative lesions in lung as a result of EGCG treatment may be related to its ability to reduce reactive oxygen species and/or to chelate iron ion resulting in a decreased production of hydroxyl radicals. Overall, these studies have identified ingredients in cruciferous vegetables and green tea that are inhibitory against lung tumorigenesis induced by NNK in rodents.",
