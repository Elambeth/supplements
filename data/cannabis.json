      "abstract": "Background: Chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) affects one in five adults and is commonly managed with long-term opioid therapy. Concerns regarding rare but catastrophic harms associated with opioids, including overdose and death, have generated interest in alternatives including cannabis; however, the comparative cost-effectiveness of these management options is uncertain. Methods: We used findings from a network meta-analysis of 90 randomized trials to develop a 1-year microsimulation model to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) between oral medical cannabis and opioids for CNCP. We used a publicly funded health care payer perspective for our analyses and obtained cost and utility data from publicly available sources. All costs are reported in 2023 Canadian dollars. All analyses were probabilistic, and we conducted sensitivity and scenario analyses to assess robustness. Results: Total mean annual cost per patient was $1,980 for oral medical cannabis and $1,851 for opioids, a difference of $129 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -$723 to $525). Mean QALYs were 0.582 for both oral medical cannabis and opioids (95% CI: -0.007 to 0.015). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that oral medical cannabis was cost-effective in 31% of iterations at willingness-to-pay thresholds up to $50,000/QALY gained. Use of opioids is associated with nonfatal and fatal overdose, whereas medical cannabis is not. Discussion: Our findings suggest that medical cannabis as an alternative to opioids for chronic pain may confer similar, but modest, benefits to patients, and reduce the risk of opioid overdose without substantially increasing costs."

As recreational cannabis has proliferated across the United States, cannabis-related emergency department visits have increased. Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, a variant of cyclic vomiting syndrome, has emerged as a recognized but poorly understood complication of chronic cannabis use among a subset of individuals. Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome is characterized by repeated cycles of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting refractory to standard antiemetics, with users reporting the compulsive use of hot showers to mitigate symptoms. Treatment modalities include intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion, topical application of capsaicin, and the use of antidopaminergics (eg, droperidol, haloperidol).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Growing bodies of evidence suggest that cannabis may play a significant role in both oncological palliative care and as a direct anticarcinogenic agent, but classification as a Schedule I substance has complicated research into its therapeutic potential, leaving the state of research scattered and heterogeneous. This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the scientific consensus on medical cannabis' viability in cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically assess the existing literature on medical cannabis, focusing on its therapeutic potential, safety profiles, and role in cancer treatment. METHODS: This study synthesized data from over 10,000 peer-reviewed research papers, encompassing 39,767 data points related to cannabis and various health outcomes. Using sentiment analysis, the study identified correlations between cannabis use and supported, not supported, and unclear sentiments across multiple categories, including cancer dynamics, health metrics, and cancer treatments. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to validate the reliability of the findings. RESULTS: The meta-analysis revealed a significant consensus supporting the use of medical cannabis in the categories of health metrics, cancer treatments, and cancer dynamics. The aggregated correlation strength of cannabis across all cancer topics indicates that support for medical cannabis is 31.38× stronger than opposition to it. The analysis highlighted the anti-inflammatory potential of cannabis, its use in managing cancer-related symptoms such as pain, nausea, and appetite loss, and explored the consensus on its use as an anticarcinogenic agent. DISCUSSION: The findings indicate a strong and growing consensus within the scientific community regarding the therapeutic benefits of cannabis, particularly in the context of cancer. The consistent correlation strengths for cannabis as both a palliative adjunct and a potential anticarcinogenic agent redefine the consensus around cannabis as a medical intervention. CONCLUSION: The consistency of positive sentiments across a wide range of studies suggests that cannabis should be re-evaluated within the medical community as a treatment option. The findings have implications for public health research, clinical practice, and discussions surrounding the legal status of medical cannabis. These results suggest a need for further research to explore the full therapeutic potential of cannabis and address knowledge gaps."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronic pain negatively impacts quality of life and remains largely undertreated. Significant safety and efficacy concerns exist with common treatment options. Medical cannabis (MC) is a non-opioid alternative for chronic pain. Lack of consistent research has limited the incorporation of MC into standards of care for pain management. Patient engagement in informing additional research is needed to ensure patients, providers and policy makers can make informed decisions on MC use. This study aims to describe patients' and community members' experiences, perspectives, beliefs, and concerns regarding utilizing MC to manage chronic pain and develop patient-centered research questions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a qualitative, descriptive, focus-group study of participants with chronic pain who had used MC, with chronic pain who had not used MC, and without chronic pain regardless of use of MC for other conditions utilizing an investigator-developed semi-structured facilitator questionnaire. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded using NVivo 12 software. Thematic analysis using open and pattern coding was used to analyze responses. RESULTS: Twenty-eight individuals participated in this study. Key emerging themes included efficacy, safety, stigma, cost, convenience, government and legal considerations, and interactions with healthcare providers. Themes were similar among groups, but emphasis varied. A list of research questions was derived from identified themes. CONCLUSION: Those choosing to use or not to use MC for treatment of their chronic pain continue to have unanswered questions about the efficacy, formulation and dosing selection, safety, cost, convenience, stigma and knowledge of their healthcare providers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, effective pain management remains challenging, with many patients also experiencing insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Cannabis, with its analgesic properties, offers a promising nonopioid alternative. This study evaluated outcomes in hospitalized RA patients using cannabis through the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed NIS data (2016-2021) using ICD-10 codes to identify RA patients. Demographic and clinical characteristics and inpatient outcomes were compared between cannabis users and nonusers. RESULTS: RA patients using cannabis (n = 42,415) were younger (mean age 51.8 vs 67.8 years), less likely to be female (60.65% vs 73.71%), and more likely to be African American (24.02% vs 12.86%) and Native American (2.25% vs 0.86%). Cannabis use was associated with lower mortality (0.98% vs 2.71%) and hospital charges ($57,773 vs $63,681). After adjusting for age, gender, race, and comorbidities, cannabis use was linked to decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.50), depression (OR: 0.47), chronic pain (OR: 0.45), and anxiety (OR: 0.55). Conversely, cannabis use increased the risk of opioid use (OR: 1.10), nicotine dependence (OR: 1.35), and alcohol use (OR: 1.35). CONCLUSION: RA patients using cannabis had lower mortality, depression, chronic pain, and anxiety, but higher risks of opioid, nicotine, and alcohol use. Further research is needed on the long-term effects of cannabis in RA management."

      "abstract": "AIMS: We measured the effects of public health-oriented cannabis access compared with the illegal market on cannabis use and related mental health outcomes in adult cannabis users. DESIGN: This was a two-arm, parallel group, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Follow-up outcome measurement took place after 6 months. SETTING: The study was conducted in Basel-Stadt, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 378 adult (aged ≥18 years) cannabis users were enrolled and randomized between August 2022 and March 2023, although only 374 users who completed baseline measures could be included. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group with public health-oriented recreational cannabis access in pharmacies (regulated cannabis products, safer use information, voluntary counseling, no advertisement; 189/188) or the illegal market control group (continued illicit cannabis sourcing; 189/186). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was self-reported severity of cannabis misuse after 6 months, as measured by the Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test - Revised (range 0-32). Secondary outcomes involved depressive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms, cannabis consumption amount, alcohol, and drug use. FINDINGS: Ten participants were not followed (2.7%). Primary analysis included those with complete data (182 vs. 182). There was some evidence of a difference in cannabis misuse between the legal cannabis intervention group (mean [M] = 10.1) and the illegal market control group (M = 10.9; β = -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.4 to 0.0, P = 0.052). These results were supported by an intention-to-treat multiple imputation analysis (n = 374). Additional sub-group analysis by whether the participant used other drugs or not suggested that any reduction in cannabis misuse was confined to those in the legal cannabis intervention group who used other drugs (PInteraction < 0.001). We found no statistically significant changes in any of the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Public health-oriented recreational cannabis access may decrease cannabis use and cannabis-related harms, especially among those using other drugs."

METHODS AND MEASURES: We recruited 1,196 college students (Study 1) and 1,409 adults (Study 2) who reported past-month cannabis to complete online surveys; a random sample of 501 adults in Study 2 completed a follow-up survey one month later. RESULTS: We found support for a 3-factor exploratory structural equation model of a 26-item TSRQ representing autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation. Associations of the TSRQ with cannabis outcomes were consistent with SDT such that greater autonomous motivation was associated with more frequent cannabis PBS use (e.g. 'Limit use to weekends'). In contrast, greater controlled motivation and amotivation were associated with more negative cannabis-related consequences and more severe cannabis use. Differences emerged for instructions referencing responsible cannabis use versus cannabis PBS in Study 1. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the expanded and adapted TSRQ to assess motivations per SDT for cannabis harm reduction behaviours. These findings warrant replication and suggest that responsible cannabis use is conceptualized to be distinct from cannabis PBS."

The objectives were to explore CHS progression in youth and its impact on health, and to assess current treatment strategies. There are the three distinct phases of CHS: prodromal, hyperemetic, and recovery. During the prodromal phase, individuals experience early morning nausea and discomfort, often mistakenly alleviated by continued cannabis use. The hyperemetic phase is marked by severe vomiting, dehydration, and complications like electrolyte imbalances, leading to potentially serious health risks. Temporary relief may be experienced through hot showers or baths. In the recovery phase, symptoms gradually resolve, and normal eating and bathing habits return. The review emphasizes the physical and psychological impacts of CHS on youth, highlighting the potential for misdiagnosis and the importance of early intervention. It stresses the need for targeted educational efforts in schools, healthcare settings, and public health campaigns to prevent delayed diagnosis and improve outcomes. Findings underscore the importance of increasing healthcare provider awareness and promoting preventive education. The review also advocates for further research into CHS pathophysiology to improve diagnostic and treatment protocols for young populations.",

OBJECTIVE: to assess the effects of cannabis derivatives for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. SEARCH METHODS: a search of the literature was carried out in the several databases, as well as a manual search of the reference lists of relevant studies, gray literature and clinical trial registries. Selection criteria and analysis: randomized controlled trials were included, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Seven randomized clinical trials were included. Cannabidiol 20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day probably increased the frequency of participants who achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in monthly seizures (20 mg/kg/day: Relative Risk [RR] 1.92; 95 % 95 %CI 1.49-2.46, n = 575, 4 RCTs; 10 mg/kg/day: RR 1.94; 95 %CI 1.32-2.86, n = 280, 2 RCTs, moderate certainty of evidence). The incidence of serious adverse events is probably increased with CBD 20 mg/kg/day (RR 2.30; 95 %CI 1.36-3.89, n = 583, 4 RCTs, moderate certainty of evidence), and may be increased with CBD 10 mg/kg/day (RR 1.62; 95 %CI 0.92-2.84, n = 272, 2 RCTs; low certainty of evidence). Certainty of evidence for other included interventions ranged from very low to low. Conclusions: For most included comparisons and outcomes, there were uncertainties regarding the effects of cannabinoids. Future RCTs could contribute to a better understanding of the effects of cannabinoids for refractory epilepsy."

In contrast, long-term use has been associated with poorer cognitive and emotional functioning, fatigue, and reduced quality of life. Although reducing or stopping cannabis use has shown benefits, there is a lack of accessible interventions. We recruited nationally for a pilot study of a remotely supervised home-based intervention to reduce cannabis use among women with MS and CUD. The trial response provided critical insights into cannabis use patterns and the significant demand for accessible, effective interventions, highlighting an urgent unmet need within the MS community."

A modified \"hedging\" and fed-batch system for multiple harvests using Oasis® foam and 120 mL DKW medium was used. Fifteen nodal and/or apical tips were planted and placed into PAR light treatments providing various red to blue ratios (polychromatic white 9:1 RB and dichromatic 2-15: 1 RB, with and without 5% far-red light). Treatments had similar light intensities (190-240 µmol · m-2 · s-1 PPFD) for a 16 h photoperiod. Shoot tips were harvested in vitro on five successive two-week cycles, with 15 mL of DKW media supplemented to each vessel following harvest. Shoot numbers, length, and fresh and dry mass were recorded at each cycle harvest. Five randomly selected shoot tips per vessel were rooted ex vitro on greenhouse mist bench for 16 days. Over multiple cycles, 5% far-red increased shoot numbers and length in both genotypes tested, regardless of polychromatic or dichromatic source. Shoots harvested per vessel increased from 15 to 28 in three cycles (6 weeks), but increased from 15 to 18 without far-red treatment. Shoot length in far-red-treated plants increased from 19 to 25 mm during cycles 1-3. Plants without far-red treatment were approximately 15 mm during the first three cycles. By cycle 5, both far-red- and non-far-red-treated plants decreased to 10 mm. Dry mass was greatest in cycle 1 for both genotypes ('Cherry 1' was 6 mg and 'BaOx' was 7 mg) under the highest amount of blue light, but 2 mg under the lowest amount of blue light. Dry mass decreased by 50% in cycle 3, to 4 mg, where it remained for the duration of the experiment. Sixty eight percent of shoots rooted ex vitro on the mist bench, regardless of any prior in vitro treatment."

This study investigates the immediate effects of P. cannabis on Cannabis sativa (C. sativa) plants and explores biological control strategies utilizing entomopathogenic fungi. Fungal isolates of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae were isolated from infected aphids, cultured, and characterized. Infection tests on aphids revealed that both fungi achieved 100% aphid mortality at high conidial concentrations (1 × 107 conidia/mL) by the 10th DAT, with Beauveria bassiana demonstrating better efficacy. In greenhouse trials on three cannabis varieties, B. bassiana effectively controlled aphid populations, keeping levels low and stable in infested plants treated with B. bassiana at the concentration of 1 × 107 conidia mL-1 (I-B) and infested plants treated with insecticide (I-I). Both I-B and I-I treatments maintained aphid populations near zero for nine weeks. In contrast, control plants showed significant aphid growth, with the Perseid variety being the most susceptible, followed by Congo Durban, while GCC exhibited the lowest susceptibility. Cannabinoid and terpene analyses revealed that treatment with insecticide substantially decreased the amount of produced cannabinoids and terpenes. In contrast, Beauveria bassiana-treated plants exhibited higher concentrations of key metabolites, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid and cannabidiolic acid, and total terpenes, compared to chemically treated plants, and in two out of three cultivars, these concentrations were higher than in control, untreated plants. The findings highlight Beauveria bassiana as an eco-friendly alternative for pest management that not only controls aphids effectively but also supports the biochemical quality of cannabis plants."

According to the psychosis continuum hypothesis, PLEs are subject to multiple risk factors. This review synthesizes current research on biological, substance use-related, and environmental risk factors for PLEs in non-clinical populations. PubMed/Medline and Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed studies published until January 2024 investigating risk factors for PLEs in non-clinical samples. Following PRISMA guidelines, 38 full-text articles were analyzed after title/abstract and full-text screening (PROSPERO registration ID: N 1001,807). Four main risk factor categories emerged. Biological vulnerabilities included specific metabolic profiles, genetic predisposition, and neurobiological alterations. Substance use patterns, particularly high-potency cannabis, showed significant associations with PLEs, with evidence for bidirectional relationships. Socio-demographic factors revealed influences of digital media use, ethnic density, and gender differences. Outcome studies demonstrated associations between PLEs and consequences including suicidal behavior and cognitive impairments. Findings suggest a complex interplay between multiple risk factors in PLE development. More attention should be paid to the interaction between biological vulnerabilities and environmental factors, as these experiences may represent important markers for mental health outcomes. A comprehensive assessment approach and proactive early intervention strategies are essential for the timely identification and management of at-risk individuals. Our findings support a multifactorial model where genetic vulnerabilities, cannabis use patterns, and socio-environmental factors influence PLE trajectories. The bidirectional cannabis-PLE relationship suggests self-regulatory mechanisms that could inform preventive interventions. Early identification of PLEs in young cannabis users represents a crucial opportunity for targeted clinical interventions."

However, it is not known the extent of cannabis use for pain, the types of pain treated, and the perceived effectiveness of cannabis for chronic pain in this region. The purpose of this study was to understand cannabis use for pain in West Virginia patients. METHODS: Ten thousand chronic pain patients were surveyed, and users and non-users of cannabis were compared. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred fifty-one people responded, with 24% using cannabis. They were in pain for longer, most >10 years. They often used other medications for pain and more often had a previous opioid prescription for pain. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients who use cannabis have higher levels of reported pain for longer durations of time than those who do not use cannabis. More information is needed to understand the implications for cannabis use in this population. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with chronic pain who use cannabis have tried multiple treatment modalities, had more types of pain, and often received an opioid prescription."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A third of epilepsy patients fail to enter seizure remission despite optimal therapeutic management. Cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs) have shown promise as a potential therapy. However, a paucity of high-quality literature regarding CBMPs' efficacy and safety profile means further investigation is needed. The study aimed to examine changes in epilepsy-specific and general health-related quality of life (HRQoL) patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: A case series of patients with epilepsy from the UK Medical Cannabis Registry analyzed changes in Quality of Life in Epilpesy-31 (QOILE-31), Single-Item Sleep Quality Score (SQS), EQ-5D-5L, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) between baseline, one, three, and six months. Adverse events (AEs) were collected and classified by severity. p < 0.050 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There were 134 patients included. Improvements were recorded from baseline to one, three, and six months in QOILE-31 and all HRQoL PROMs (p < 0.050). Forty patients (29.85%) reported a minimal clinically important difference in Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31) at six months. There were 18 (13.43%) AEs reported by 5 (3.73%) patients, mainly mild and moderate. DISCUSSION: The proportion of patients achieving a clinically significant change is similar to existing CBMPs in epilepsy literature. AE incidence was lower than similar studies although this may be due to the large proportion (67.16%) of individuals who were not cannabis naïve. CONCLUSION: Initiation of CBMPs was associated with an improvement across all PROMs. CBMPs were well tolerated across the cohort. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to help determine causality.",

However, there is no evidence concerning the long-term consequences of hormonal treatment. To determine the connection between the effects of hormonal treatment and cannabinoid accumulation, hemp plants were treated with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid (SA) to investigate their effects on gene expression and cannabinoid content levels in female inflorescences at 3 days and 4 weeks after treatment. The treatments influenced the transcript levels of five key cannabinoid biosynthesis genes, with 1.0 mM GABA significantly increasing OAC, THCAS, and CBCAS transcripts within 48 to 72 h. Additionally, 1.0 mM GABA led to a significant increase in tetrahydrocannabinol content by day three and significant increases in total cannabidiol and cannabinoid by week four. In addition, both ABA and SA induced transient, dose-dependent increases or decreases in gene expressions, but cannabinoid accumulation at 4 weeks showed no significant changes compared to the control. These results provide valuable insights for hormonal application in cultivation and the development of traits that enhance cannabinoid production in cannabis cultivation, which could significantly contribute to optimizing industrial applications.",

Given recent policy changes in favor of cannabis legalization, it is important to understand how cannabis and cannabinoids may impact people with these disorders. We aimed to assess the effects of cannabis on the onset and course of depression, bipolar disorder, ADs, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and also to explore the therapeutic potential of cannabis and cannabinoids for these disorders. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was completed. The PubMed® database from January 1990 to May 2018 was searched. We included longitudinal cohort studies, and also all studies using cannabis or a cannabinoid as an active intervention, regardless of the study design. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included: 32 reported on illness onset, nine on illness course, and six on cannabinoid therapeutics. Cohort studies varied significantly in design and quality. The literature suggests that cannabis use is linked to the onset and poorer clinical course in bipolar disorder and PTSD, but this finding is not as clear in depression and anxiety disorders (ADs). There have been few high-quality studies of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals in clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: These conclusions are limited by a lack of well-controlled longitudinal studies. We suggest that future research be directed toward high-quality, prospective studies of cannabis in clinical populations with mood and ADs, in addition to controlled studies of cannabinoid constituents and pharmaceuticals in these populations.Reprinted from Am J Addict 2020; 29:9-26, with permission from American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry.

This study assessed the changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and adverse events in PTSD patients prescribed CBMPs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational cohort study included PTSD patients enrolled on the UK Medical Cannabis Registry for 18 months or longer. Changes in PTSD-specific symptoms (IES-R), anxiety (GAD-7), sleep quality (SQS), and general HRQoL (EQ-5D-5 L) were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. RESULTS: In 269 patients, significant improvements in PTSD symptoms, anxiety, sleep quality, and HRQoL were observed at all follow-up points (p < 0.001). On multivariate logistic regression, male gender (OR = 0.51; 95% CI:0.28-0.94; p = 0.034) was associated with a reduced chance of reporting improvements in IES-R. Adverse events were reported by 70 (26.02%) patients, with insomnia (n = 42, 15.61%) and fatigue (n = 40, 14.87%) being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: CBMPs were associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms, anxiety, sleep, and HRQoL at up to 18 months. Although the study's observational nature limits causal conclusions, these findings support further assessment of medical cannabis.

This disallows patients from using a substance they find beneficial, when other treatments have failed, for symptom relief including pain, nausea, insomnia, and mood. We found no other facilities with medical cannabis policies. Our team amended the medical cannabis policy to align with California state laws to facilitate inpatient use. Project aims were to (1) align the policy with state guidelines, (2) update workflow including eligibility algorithm with lockbox, and (3) improve patients' pain relief. DESCRIPTION: A clinical nurse specialist spearheaded a cannabis interdisciplinary integration committee. A medical cannabis policy existed but did not meet recent legislative changes, prohibiting inpatient cannabis utilization. The committee revamped existing policy and created an eligibility algorithm, a medical administration record order, and a drug cross-referencing guide. OUTCOME: Fifty patients were able to utilize cannabis during their inpatient stay over a 1-year period after medical cannabis policy implementation. Pain relief was the primary reason for cannabis usage, with 60% of surveyed patients reporting reducing opioids since starting cannabis. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the revamped medical cannabis procedure to facilitate inpatient use was successful in implementation and patient outcomes. This can serve as a guiding framework for other institutions.",

      "abstract": "Kombucha is a well-known fermented drink that gained interest due to its gut health benefits. However, it has a harsh taste of acetic acid and is hard to consume. Thai Cannabis leaves (Cannabis sativa sp. Hang Kra Rog Phu phan ST1) contain high protein and phytochemicals which can improve the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and enhance the organoleptic quality of the Kombucha. This study revealed the effect of infusing assam green tea leaves with cannabis leaves on the fermentation rate, microbial communities, volatile compounds, and overall quality and taste of the kombucha. The high protein content (23.10%) of Cannabis leaves was found. Phytonutrients and phytochemicals found in the leaves promotes LAB growth, which resulted in the higher number of LAB in the treatment with cannabis leaves. At the end of fermentation (day 7), the highest LAB count (5.53 log CFU mL-1) was presented in kombucha infused with 30% cannabis leaves. Kombucha with better quality, higher pH, and less acidity was obtained in a dose manner. The change in microbial communities was detected using metagenomic analysis. The prominence of Dekkera and Komagataeibacter, with low abundance of Zygosaccharomyces and Weissella were identified. These microorganisms improved flavor by lessening strong fermented odor and harsh acidic taste. From volatile compounds, HS-SPME-GCMS revealed that kombucha infused with 30% cannabis leaves possessed less acetic acid, ethanol, and carbon dioxide and gave a better odor and taste. Hence, cannabis leaves was the novel substrate for kombucha fermentation by enhancing LAB growth and improving the overall qualities."

Further, we examined whether these mindfulness profiles were indirectly associated with alcohol and cannabis-related outcomes via alcohol and cannabis use motives. METHOD: Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to determine the number of latent classes among 771 US university students (75.7% White, 66.8% female) who consumed alcohol and cannabis in the prior month. Additionally, parallel mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether mindfulness profiles were indirectly associated with alcohol- and cannabis-related outcomes via alcohol and cannabis use motives. RESULTS: LPA indicated a 4-class solution fit optimally. Further, the high mindfulness group was generally the most adaptive (lower scores) across alcohol and cannabis outcomes, whereas the judgmentally observing group was generally the most maladaptive (higher scores). Indirect effect analyses revealed that compared to the low mindfulness group, the high mindfulness group reported lower scores on alcohol- and cannabis-related outcomes via lower alcohol- and cannabis-related coping motives. CONCLUSIONS: These findings can inform prevention and intervention efforts using mindfulness techniques and interventions among students who engage in problematic alcohol and cannabis use.

We used repeated cross-sectional data from young adults (N = 15,251; Mage = 22.02 years, SDage = 2.22; 68% female) who enrolled in the annual, statewide Washington Young Adult Health Survey between 2015 and 2022. Logistic time-varying effect models showed that cannabis use increased from ages 18-22 and remained relatively stable through age 26. Most cannabis-specific risk factors increased gradually across young adulthood, although perceptions of cannabis use acceptability (injunctive norms) increased substantially through age 23 followed by decreases. Ease of obtaining cannabis, perceptions about others' use (descriptive norms), and low perceived physical harm were generally associated with any past-month cannabis use with stronger associations around age 18. Injunctive norms and low perceived psychological harm were consistently associated with past-month use across young adulthood. Ease of obtaining cannabis, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and low psychological harm were associated with frequent cannabis use across young adulthood with associations strongest prior to age 21. Low perceived physical harm was associated with frequent use across young adulthood with associations getting somewhat stronger across ages. Findings underscore the importance of focusing on cannabis-specific risk factors in preventive intervention efforts over the course of young adulthood, including focus on young adults in their mid- 20 s in the context of legalized cannabis."

      "abstract": "Cannabis has a long history of utilization in various regions around the world for different purposes. In western Nepal, Cannabis is specifically used as a food crop, textile material, and lucrative cash crop, although the Nepali Narcotic Drug Control Act of 1976 ultimately prohibits Nepali farmers from sowing, trading, or selling their Cannabis crop. Regardless of this act, farmers are continuing these practices illegally, especially in remote regions where Cannabis has grown for centuries. The purpose of this study was to understand the current social acceptability of Cannabis cultivation in rural Nepal and to consider the future potential for legitimate cultivation. We tested two interconnected behaviors associated with Cannabis farming in the hill regions of western Nepal. The item count technique was applied to estimate the number of farmers who actively sow or plant Cannabis, and may also be selling Cannabis husks, a byproduct used in illicit drug production, for income generation. We compared our item count treatment with a direct questionnaire for farmers within the same region. Our results indicate that planting Cannabis is not a sensitive behavior, as more than 97% of the respondents directly stated that they plant Cannabis. The item count technique, however, did indicate that selling Cannabis husks is a sensitive behavior, where 29% were shown to sell husks when they were asked using the item count technique, whereas 2% of the farmers confirmed selling husks when asked directly. We also found that all the households in our study consumed seeds, which are highly nutritious food crops, both at home and at community gatherings. Direct questionnaire surveys also revealed that farmers can trade their seed crops for goods such as salt, soap, and oil or sell them for cash income. Thus, the current law, which is based solely on drug control, needs to be changed on the basis of the revealed multifaceted values and realities, including health, culture and rural economic development."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders (SUD) frequently occur alongside bipolar disorder (BD), with some studies indicating a 29 % comorbidity rate in Western populations [1]. The relationship between BD and SUD is intricate and bidirectional - drug misuse can increase the risk of developing BD, and individuals with BD have a higher risk of developing SUD. This complex interplay often leads to earlier BD onset, more hospitalizations, and reduced effectiveness of pharmacological treatments, particularly mood stabilizers. This work aims to describe the impact of drugs in the risk of relapse in BD and to approach the differences in the evolution in substance users compared to non-users. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study including the patients admitted to Hospital Clínic of Barcelona acute psychiatric unit with the diagnosis of manic or mixed episode during the period between 2015 and 2019. We established a follow-up of 3 years from the date of admission in which hospital readmissions are examined. RESULTS: The study, which included 279 patients, concluded that only tobacco users showed significantly higher rates of emergency room (ER) visits and hospital readmissions in the period study, while cannabis was only associated with earlier onset of illness, current manic polarity, the presence of psychotic symptoms and a higher likelihood of discontinuing treatment. Alcohol, cocaine and stimulants did not appear to have an association with the variables studied. LIMITATIONS: Lack of follow-up information from people leaving the region or changing to private sector services, lack of detailed information around the pattern and history of consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco seemed to have a clear negative association with the course of the illness. Cannabis, while its use was not associated with the relapse rate, was indirectly associated with variables suggesting a more severe symptomatology and a possible qualitatively different course of illness. More evidence is needed to define the mechanisms and patterns related to these effects."

We sought to evaluate the effect of cannabis legalization on drug seizures and their related disparities by race to understand how law enforcement have adjusted to this rapidly shifting legal landscape. METHODS: Drug seizure data were collected from the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and include state, race, and drug types from 16 states with over 95 % population coverage for 2017-2022. Treatment and control assignments were determined by whether cannabis had been legalized for adult use between 2017 and 2022. Log seizure rates and Black-white risk ratios were calculated using census data. Two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences models robust to multiple treatment periods evaluated the effect of cannabis legalization on seizure rates and Black-white risk ratios. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that cannabis legalization significantly reduced overall drug seizures, particularly those involving cannabis. Of the other seizure types tested, only one non-cannabis drug seizure rate type was significant. We found a moderate yet significant decrease in the Black-white risk ratio for cannabis seizures, though all other racial disparities in seizure rates persisted after the legalization of cannabis. DISCUSSION: Cannabis legalization was associated with reduced drug seizures overall, driven by a large reduction in cannabis seizures. There was also a significant reduction in the Black-white risk ratio for cannabis seizures, though Black individuals remained at higher risk for all drug seizure types compared to white individuals. While expected to decrease without cannabis smell to prompt seizures, non-cannabis drug seizures were unchanged except for an increase in methamphetamine seizures not involving cannabis, potentially due to shifting enforcement priorities. These results suggest that cannabis policy reform can alleviate law enforcement burdens and may improve racial disparities in drug seizures to a small extent yet highlight the continued necessity for policies addressing systemic biases in drug enforcement."

      "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) nutrition and germplasm of clones can influence biomass and cannabinoid concentration in medicinal cannabis. However, there are discrepancies on the optimal nitrogen (N) application rate at the flowering stage to achieve maximum yield and if, or how, this interacts with clones from different seed lines of the same genotype. This research examined the relationship between N application rate, concentration of cannabinoids and biomass yield of a CBD-type medicinal cannabis cultivar in clones propagated from five different seed lines (hereafter referred to as clones). Clonal rooted cuttings were propagated from five mother plants germinated from seeds of cultivar 'Tas1'. Five N levels (30, 90, 160, 240 and 400 mg/L N) were imposed at the start of the inflorescence period and continued until harvest eight weeks later. Some pollen contamination occurred during the trial so that seed biomass was assessed for each plant and included in statistical analysis. Weight of total biomass, leaves and inflorescence (from upper and lower canopy positions), N%, and cannabinoid concentrations were measured after the harvest. Results indicated that increasing N supply generated a clear upward trend in inflorescence biomass that peaked at 160 mg/L N after which it did not significantly change, while leaf biomass steadily increased with N. Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) concentrations decreased significantly with increasing N concentration in leaves with a similar, but non-significant, trend for inflorescences. The CBD to THC ratio increased with increased N. Clone source was strongly correlated with cannabinoid concentration, but not leaf, inflorescence or total biomass, across all N treatments. Clones 13 and 27 developed greater cannabinoid concentrations relative to clones 18 and 26 irrespective of N treatment. Pollen contamination induced seed development that comprised up to 5% of inflorescence biomass dry weight but this did not significantly affect whole-plant biomass, N accumulation (N%), or cannabinoid concentration. These findings provide valuable insights for improving cannabinoid yield in this widely cultivated plant species.",

METHOD: A quasi-experimental study with 2031 students (53.1% from 3rd ESO and 46.9% from 4th ESO), divided into an intervention group (IG) and a comparison group (CG). Data collected in October 2020 and April 2021 were analyzed using t-tests and logistic regression adjusted by inverse probability weighting and educational centers. RESULTS: In April, in 3rd ESO, the IG showed a lower probability of lifetime alcohol (OR: 0.62) and cannabis use (OR: 0.34) compared to the CG, as well as a 15.1% higher prevalence of resistance to peer pressure to consume cannabis. In October, in 4th ESO, the moderately positive impact persisted, but by April, it had disappeared, with no clear effect on students who participated in the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The ARGOS Community-Educational Program had a limited impact on alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use, resistance to peer pressure, and increased risk perception, particularly in 3rd ESO and the early stages of 4th ESO. Reinforcing the program with preventive interventions to consolidate and enhance its impact is deemed necessary."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine whether cannabis exposure calls to the British Columbia Drug and Poison Information Centre (DPIC) were impacted by the legalization of non-medical cannabis in Canada. METHODS: We fit interrupted time series models to monthly counts of cannabis cases from 2013 to 2021, stratified by age and cannabis form. We set the intervention month to October 2018 legalization for cases involving inhaled dried cannabis and ingestible oils and capsules. We set the intervention month to January 2020 for cases involving edibles and inhaled concentrates to reflect their commercial rollout after their October 2019 legalization. RESULTS: DPIC managed 3989 cases involving cannabis exposure between 2013 and 2021. The rate (95% CI) of all cannabis cases increased by 17% (14%, 20%) annually from 2013 to October 2018 legalization. The highest pre-legalization increase was in pediatric edible cases with 52% (36%, 69%) and 57% (35%, 82%) annual increases among children aged 5 and under and 6 to 12, respectively. Upon legalization, the rate of cases consuming oil and capsule products spiked by 26% (- 19%, 96%) followed by a decrease, but remaining higher than the pre-legalization rate. Legalization did not have an immediate effect on the rate of cases involving edibles or inhaled cannabis, which all continued to increase post-legalization, albeit at slower rates. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the contributing factors to cannabis case trends at DPIC, these data highlight the importance of poisoning prevention policies, promotion of low-risk use, and routine surveillance."

This involves a variety of products containing ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), THC + CBD combinations, or derivatives. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the positive and negative effects of medicinal cannabis on mental health diagnoses and related symptoms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition. Searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (October 2023 and July 2024) identified 18,341 studies, of which 49 controlled studies from 15 different countries were included. All studies focused on treatment-seeking participants using medicinal cannabis for (symptoms of) their mental health diagnosis. Included diagnoses were anxiety disorders, tic disorders, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorders, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, psychosis, substance use disorders, insomnia, and bipolar disorders. Varying product compositions showed different effects. Most consistently, high doses of CBD were followed by some acute relief in anxiety, while CBD + THC combinations alleviated withdrawal in cannabis use disorder and improved sleep. In clinical trials, THC was associated most with dose-dependent adverse events and, in some cases, deterioration of primary study outcomes, e.g., in psychosis. In naturalistic studies, participants who used THC reported symptom improvement following usage. Risks of bias across studies were prevalent, and no study found long-lasting medicinal effects or improvement. Overall, medicinal cannabis may provide short-term relief for certain symptoms but is not a cure or without mental health risks."

METHODS: The PHMSC considers areas where evidence is uncertain or emerging or practice does not follow the evidence to provide clinical advice based on a review and assessment of scientific work, including systematic reviews and individual studies. Sources of evidence included a living systematic review on cannabis and cannabinoid treatments for chronic noncancer pain and a series of living systematic reviews and primary studies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1A: Clinicians should counsel patients about the benefits and harms of cannabis or cannabinoids when patients are considering whether to start or continue to use cannabis or cannabinoids to manage their chronic noncancer pain. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1B: Clinicians should counsel the following subgroups of patients that the harms of cannabis or cannabinoid use for chronic noncancer pain are likely to outweigh the benefits: young adult and adolescent patients, patients with current or past substance use disorder, patients with serious mental illness, and frail patients and those at risk for falling. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Clinicians should advise against starting or continuing to use cannabis or cannabinoids to manage chronic noncancer pain in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or actively trying to conceive. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Clinicians should advise patients against the use of inhaled cannabis to manage chronic noncancer pain."

The patient's motivation for reconstructive penile surgery led to abstinence from the substance use and cooperation with treatment. Five months after hospitalization, successful penile reconstruction was completed. The patient remained abstinent and was engaged in regular psychiatric follow-ups, showing no signs of acute psychopathology.

      "abstract": "Background: In 2020, the Lebanese parliament legalized cannabis for medical and industrial use, sparking diverse reactions among health care professionals (HCP). Few studies have been conducted to reflect the position of HCP on the topic, and no previous studies targeted all physicians with relevant specialties or had a large sample size. The current study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the Lebanese medical community toward medicinal cannabis (MC). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted targeting HCP from different backgrounds and specialties. The survey questionnaire was disseminated through different scientific societies in the Lebanese Order of Physicians and other professional bodies. An online survey was shared with oncologists, rheumatologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, pharmacists, and psychotherapists across different geographic regions. It covered questions about sociodemographic details, knowledge, attitude, and practice related to MC. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed. A total of 202 HCP responded to the survey, yielding a response rate of 34%. Results: Eighteen percent of the participants described their level of knowledge about the indications of MC as good. Twenty-five percent of the respondents are willing to prescribe, and 30% \"may consider\" it. Among those willing to prescribe, the majority may consider MC to treat chronic pain, palliative care, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and anxiety. Respondents' knowledge about the side effects of MC is as follows: driving difficulties (82%), addiction (69%), drug interactions (65%), and weight gain (43%). Willingness to prescribe varies by medical specialty, previous clinical experience with MC, and gender. The majority of the participants expressed concerns about the potential harm of using MC and indicated that legalization would negatively impact society. Sixty-nine percent of the respondents reported not receiving any formal education about MC and agreed on the need to expand knowledge about its indications and side effects. The majority agreed that MC should be dispensed based on a prescription from a physician with special training and recognized the importance of establishing a national registry for patients undergoing MC treatment, as well as the necessity of guidelines for approval. Conclusion: The current data indicate that attitudes toward prescribing MC vary by medical specialty, gender, and clinical experience. Implementation of effective educational strategies in Lebanon to enhance HCP knowledge about MC and promote its proper use is crucial.",

      "abstract": "United States military veterans face heightened vulnerability to sleep disturbances due to factors such as irregular sleep schedules, combat-related stress, and co-occurring mental health disorders. These sleep disturbances are often exacerbated by substance use, including alcohol and cannabis, as veterans may rely on these substances to self-medicate for stress and sleep issues. However, the interplay between sleep quality, substance use, and perceived stress remains poorly understood, particularly on a day-to-day basis. This study aimed to explore the dynamic associations between these factors using daily diary data collected over three months from 74 veterans with elevated PTSD symptoms and problematic cannabis use. Data from this study are secondary analysis. Dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) was employed to examine both within-day and day-to-day lagged associations between sleep quality, perceived stress, and substance use (alcohol and cannabis). Results showed that worse sleep quality was associated with higher perceived stress the next day, which in turn predicted greater alcohol consumption. Additionally, stress mediated the relationship between poor sleep quality and increased alcohol use. For cannabis, while no day-to-day lagged effects were observed, within-day analyses revealed that higher cannabis use was associated with lower stress and better sleep quality that same night. These results highlight the complex and bidirectional relationships between sleep, stress, and substance use among veterans, underscoring the need for interventions that address these dynamics holistically. Future research should further explore these interactions using real-time data to inform tailored interventions for improving sleep and mental health outcomes in this population."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Anxiety sensitivity (AS), or fear of anxious arousal, is a transdiagnostic risk factor that may be associated with greater risk for problematic cannabis use. Individuals with high AS may use cannabis to cope with distressing physiological sensations. However, there is also conflicting research suggesting that individuals with high AS may avoid cannabis use because it is perceived to cause unpleasant physiological sensations. Rates of cannabis use disorder (CUD) are high and escalating in the US, so identification and understanding of risk factors such as AS is crucial for prevention and treatment of CUD. The purpose of the current review is to summarize and critically review the, at times, conflicting existing research on AS and CUD, present a unifying conceptualization of AS as a risk factor for CUD, and establish a future research agenda. METHODS: Empirical studies indexed in PubMed or PsycInfo as of Spring 2024 testing associations between AS and cannabis use were included. Fifty studies were reviewed and coded by two independent coders who evaluated study characteristics and risk of bias. RESULTS: Results were qualitatively synthesized and suggested a direct association between elevated AS and greater levels of coping-oriented and possibly problematic cannabis use, but not lifetime cannabis use or cannabis use frequency. DISCUSSION: A conceptual model is presented in which high AS may lead to greater coping-oriented cannabis use, and, in turn, problematic cannabis use in the presence of symptoms of psychopathology and positive cannabis expectancies. Future research should test this model utilizing prospective and/or experimental studies with valid assessments of AS and cannabis use among diverse cannabis using samples.",

Drawing from leading theories of polysubstance use, we used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to examine the prevalence of reported lifetime use of cannabis and cocaine, heroin, and/or methamphetamine among non-pregnant respondents ages 18-59 years. After identifying the subpopulation that reported using multiple drugs, we used multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify their demographic characteristics and factors associated with drug treatment participation. Within our analytic sample (N = 16,946), 18.7% reported lifetime cannabis use and cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine use; 1.4% reported using all four of these drugs in their lifetime. Among individuals who reported using multiple drugs, 21.3% reported drug treatment participation. Compared to respondents who had never been in drug treatment, those who had been had higher odds of being non-Hispanic Black (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.8), being in fair/poor health (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), and reporting more medical conditions (AOR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4). Being female, Mexican American, married, and a non-citizen lowered the odds of drug treatment. Having more than a high-school education and having a household income of more than $100,000 also reduced the odds of drug treatment."

      "abstract": "Background:Cannabis sativa L. and its products are becoming popular for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. One of the main phytocannabinoids contained in cannabis is cannabidiol (CBD), which is a component of numerous cosmetic preparations used to treat inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. However, current data regarding the efficacy and safety of CBD for dermatological indications are limited. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of high-CBD Cannabis sativa L. extract (eCBD) in a model of AD. Methods: Dermatitis was induced by repeated application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) to the skin of the rats' ears. The therapeutic effect of eCBD was evaluated in behavioral, histopathological, and hematological studies following topical application as an ointment containing 2% CBD. Results: Application of the ointment containing eCBD resulted in attenuation of DNCB-induced inflammation. Interestingly, an anti-edematous effect was more pronounced in rats treated with the eCBD than in rats treated with 1% hydrocortisone ointment. However, eCBD did not reduce the frequency of DNCB-induced scratching, while there was a visible antipruritic effect of 1% hydrocortisone application. Histopathological analysis revealed that both eCBD and 1% hydrocortisone ointments significantly decreased mast cell count compared with the Vaseline control group. Furthermore, treatment with an ointment containing eCBD resulted in a decrease in the number of leukocytes in the blood. Conclusions: Topically administered eCBD had a stronger anti-edematous effect than glucocorticosteroid and differently affected hematological parameters. It is suggested that eCBD has therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study investigated associations between social network characteristics and alcohol and cannabis (AC) use among non-reservation-living American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) emerging adults (18-25 years old), with a focus on the potential protective influence of AI/AN traditional practices (e.g., dancing, storytelling, beading). METHOD: The study used a multi-level, multivariable dyadic approach to analyze personal network composition and network connectivity (centrality and density) from 470 AI/AN emerging adults living in non-reservation areas across the United States. Eligible participants completed an online survey, which included questions about social networks and AC use. RESULTS: Findings indicated that network members who were similar in age, perceived to be friends, and lived nearby were more likely to be AC-use partners. Network members who shared AI/AN identity but did not engage in traditional practices were more likely to be AC-use partners than non-AI/AN network members. Analysis of network density demonstrated that having highly connected networks was associated with lower odds of respondents engaging in AC use with members of their networks. However, highly central network members had higher odds of AC use with respondents relative to those less central in the network. Findings were robust when controlling for respondent and network AC use. CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the significance of the network context of AC use for non-reservation AI/AN emerging adults. The protective role of AI/AN traditional practices highlights the importance of strength-based intervention approaches that promote healthy social connections and traditional practices. Future research should test hypotheses longitudinally to inform more effective prevention strategies."

      "abstract": "Understanding smoking behaviors in vulnerable groups is essential for effective cessation services. This study characterizes tobacco consumption and identifies factors associated with nicotine dependence and motivation to quit among individuals entering alcohol and cannabis treatment programs. A multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted in ten centers in Barcelona province. Participants' sociodemographics and tobacco use were assessed, including cigarette consumption and nicotine dependence (Fagerström test). Self-efficacy and motivation to quit were measured on a 0-10 Likert scale. A decision-tree analysis identified factors linked to moderate-to-high nicotine dependence (Fagerström ≥ 5) and high cessation motivation (≥7). Most participants (96.1%) use tobacco daily, with 57.0% using manufactured and 42.2% roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes. Mean cigarette consumption was 15.2/day (SD = 8.7), with nicotine dependence (4.4, SD = 2.3). Cannabis users started smoking tobacco earlier than those who used alcohol. Over the past year, two-thirds attempted quitting and 60% had high cessation motivation. Self-efficacy for quitting was moderate (mean = 5.1; SD = 3.3). RYO use, age over 45, and alcohol use were associated with moderate-to-high nicotine dependence (probabilities = 0.52, 0.62, and 0.71, respectively). Having a non-tobacco social network was linked to a high motivation to quit (probability = 0.72). Participants had moderate nicotine dependence, low self-efficacy, and high motivation to quit tobacco. Dependence was higher among RYO users, ≥45 years/old, and people with alcohol use disorder. High motivation was more frequent among those with a non-tobacco social network. Integrating cessation support into substance treatment, focusing on RYO and young users, and promoting self-efficacy and tobacco-free socialization may enhance cessation success."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis is widely consumed across the United States; however, studies assessing the association between cannabis use and male sexual health, specifically erectile dysfunction (ED) and testosterone deficiency (TD), have mixed results and small sample sizes. AIM: To evaluate the impact of cannabis abuse/dependence on risks of ED, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5-i) prescription, TD, and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) using a population-level analysis. METHODS: We sampled men ≥18 years old from the large claims database, TriNetX, in 2025. Patients previously diagnosed with or treated for ED or TD and those with prior prostatectomy were excluded. Patients were split into two cohorts: diagnoses of cannabis abuse/dependence or not. Cohorts were propensity score-matched on 49 pertinent factors. Risk of ED, TD, PDE5-i prescription, and TRT were compared at 3 months-1 year (patients from 2005-2024) and 3-5 years (patients from 2005-2020) from cannabis diagnoses. Subgroups of age younger or older than 40 years were also analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess differences in time to development of ED and TD. OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were risk of diagnosis of ED or TD (testosterone level <300 ng/dL). Secondary outcomes were risk of new prescription of PDE5-i or TRT. RESULTS: Between 2005-2024, 30 964 patients with and 1 473 182 without cannabis diagnoses were identified with 29 442 in each cohort after matching. Between 2005-2020, 17 948 patients with and 839 496 without cannabis abuse/dependence were identified, with 17 211 in each cohort after matching. Cannabis abuse/dependence was significantly associated with ED (0.9% vs. 0.2%, RR = 3.99 [3.05, 5.21]), TD (0.2% vs. 0.1%, RR = 2.19 [1.45, 3.31]), and PDE5-i prescription (0.8% vs. 0.2%, RR = 3.80 [2.86, 5.04]) at 3 months-1 year, and only ED at 3-5 years (1.61% vs. 1.34%, RR = 1.20, 95% CI = [1.01, 1.43]). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly shorter time to development of ED (HR = 1.65, 95% CI = [1.47, 1.85]) and TD (HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.69]) associated with cannabis abuse/dependence. No association between cannabis abuse/dependence and TRT was found. In those <40 years old, only ED and PDE5-i were significant at 3 months-1 year, but not at 3-5 years. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our findings support an association between cannabis abuse/dependence, ED, and TD, which providers may consider when treating patients with these diagnoses. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Strengths include having a large, national sample of patients. Limitations include inability to assess dose-dependent relationships and using diagnosis codes as proxies for cannabis use. CONCLUSION: Cannabis abuse/dependence is associated with increased risk of ED, PDE5-i prescription, and TD."

      "abstract": "The eradication of poverty and malnutrition are some of the main goals set by the United Nations through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2. Humans have traditionally used Cannabis sativa L. for a variety of purposes, including medicine and as a raw ingredient for goods with added value such as drinks, cakes, and oil. The crop has gained considerable popularity in various industries due to its usage either as a fresh or processed material. The growing demand for Cannabis sativa's raw materials for a range of applications has led to a steady increase in its cultivation. Because of this constant growing demand, it is essential that growers have a thorough awareness of all environmental conditions, particularly light intensity and the right fertiliser, for improvement of plant growth, yield and quality. Therefore, the study objective was to investigate the combined effect of different fertiliser types (chemical and organic) on the yield and biochemical constituents of Cannabis sativa under varying growing environments (shade net and open space), to enable comparative analysis to be done to assist growers in producing high-quality Cannabis sativa crops for commercial purposes. Fresh and freeze-dried samples were used to measure the yield and biochemical constituents. The treatment combination of shade net and chemical fertiliser resulted in superior inflorescence water content (40.2 g) and total phenols (14.7 GAE/100 g DW) compared to other treatments. Potassium content (989 mg/100 g DW) was superior under the treatment combination of chemical fertiliser and the open space environment compared to other treatments. Therefore, growers must consider the combination of light intensity and chemical fertiliser for yield and quality maximisation, whether under shade net or open space growing environments."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of cannabis use has historically been higher among men than among women, yet the past few decades have seen a significant narrowing of this gender gap. The narrowing gender gap is likely attributable to multiple factors, including global and regional shifts in gender norms related to cannabis, which may be influenced by legalization of recreational cannabis use in many countries, including in Canada where the present study took place. The goal of this study was to explore perceived gender norms about cannabis use and how these norms might influence behavior. METHODS: We conducted in-depth, one-to-one interviews with a sample of 23 adults in Toronto, Ontario, Canada who had been in treatment for cannabis-related harms. We used the Braun & Clarke method of reflexive thematic analysis and a theoretical framework grounded in Connell's masculinities science and more recent critical femininities scholarship to explore perceived gender norms about cannabis. In particular, we were interested in how perceived norms might influence behavior and how an understanding of changing norms can contribute to developing gender-responsive or gender-transformative interventions for cannabis use disorder (CUD). RESULTS: Our analysis generated three main themes. Masculine Dominance of Cannabis Use demonstrates the social construction of recreational cannabis use (especially smoking cannabis) as a dominant masculine behavior. Cannabis Use as Deviation from Femininity demonstrates how increased stigma and social harms experienced by women and gender-diverse people is accomplished by framing their cannabis use as inauthentic and deviant. Finally, Rejecting and Reconfiguring Gender Norms about Cannabis suggests challenges to masculine dominance of cannabis use and how cannabis legalization may have catalyzed this process (possibly by increasing visibility of women using cannabis). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gender continues to play a meaningful role in determining social cannabis norms, though relationships between gender and cannabis norms are clearly changing, possibly in connection to legalization of non-medical cannabis use. We end by discussing implications for treatment (e.g., norm-based interventions to encourage treatment-seeking among men) and public health (e.g., normalizing women's and gender-diverse people's cannabis use may reduce sociocultural harms associated with cannabis use).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug, and admissions for cannabis use disorders (CUDs) are increasing globally, posing a significant public health challenge. Despite its negative consequences, a substantial proportion of individuals with problematic use do not seek treatment. In recent years, digital health interventions (DHIs) have emerged as accessible and cost-effective solutions, empowering users to manage their health care. CANreduce is one such eHealth intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing cannabis use (CU); however, its suboptimal adherence rates underscore the need for strategies to enhance user engagement and motivation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the effectiveness, adherence, and user experience of the Spanish version of CANreduce 2.0 by employing focus groups (FGs) within a user-centered design approach that actively involves both users and professionals. METHODS: Separate FGs were conducted for users and professionals, involving a total of 10 participants. Users were recruited from individuals registered on the CANreduce 2.0 platform and active cannabis users, while professionals comprised addiction specialists familiar with the platform. Each session was held remotely and moderated by 2 interviewers following a semistructured script. Qualitative analysis of the transcripts was performed using MAXQDA software and content analysis methodology to identify key themes related to the acceptability, usability, and utility of CANreduce 2.0. RESULTS: The qualitative analysis identified 3 main themes, encompassing 15 subcodes. Within the \"motivation and awareness\" theme, both users (n=6, mean age 31.8 years, SD 4.1 years) and professionals (n=4, mean age 37.25 years, SD 1.71 years) frequently discussed the importance of \"motivation\" and \"problem awareness\" as crucial for the success of CANreduce 2.0. In the \"guidance and use\" theme, the subcode \"complement to face-to-face therapy\" was the most emphasized. Professionals supported CANreduce 2.0 as a valuable adjunct to in-person therapy, serving as both an educational and monitoring tool, with no objections raised by either group. Lastly, within the \"content and design\" theme, \"information,\" \"small achievements,\" and \"personalized content\" emerged as key areas for improvement, highlighting the need to enhance motivation and adherence through gamification and tailored content. CONCLUSIONS: Personalization, robust motivational strategies, and an engaging, interactive design are essential for the success of DHIs, particularly in addiction treatment. Collaboration among technology developers, health care professionals, and users should be central to the development process, fostering the cocreation of practical and effective solutions that are responsive to the needs of those seeking treatment. This approach ensures that DHIs are not only functional but also widely accepted and impactful. Insights from this study will inform the ongoing refinement of CANreduce 2.0, enhancing its relevance and effectiveness in addressing CU.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabis as a therapeutic agent is accessible to a growing number of people, though research suggests that many medical cannabis (MC) users undertake their cannabinoid therapy independently, without collaborating with a cannabis clinician or informing their primary care provider (PCP). The effects of medical collaboration or disclosure to PCP on outcomes of cannabinoid therapy are unknown. Researchers anticipate that those who collaborate with a cannabis clinician or disclose their medical cannabis use to their PCP will find MC to be more effective, use less delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and more cannabidiol (CBD), and experience fewer side effects. METHODS: Through an online survey, medical cannabis users reported their cannabis usage patterns, health outcomes, PCP awareness, and collaboration with cannabis clinicians. These responses were analyzed using a variety of statistical tests to search for differences in reported efficacy, specific cannabinoid, and side effects between different levels of medical professional involvement (n = 988). RESULTS: Patients who either worked with a cannabis clinician or reported their use of their PCP reported significantly higher efficacy (p < 0.001), and in the case of working specifically with a cannabis clinician, higher daily doses of cannabidiol were used (p < 0.001). CBD doses did not vary between those who had disclosed their MC use to their PCP and those who had not. There were no significant differences in THC doses or side effects identified between groups. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that undertaking cannabinoid therapy with PCP awareness or guidance from a cannabis clinician is associated with better outcomes."

With Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) potency in cannabis products on the rise, concerns regarding associated health implications, including syncope, have emerged. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the prevalence and characteristics of cannabis-associated syncope among adolescents and young adults presenting to emergency departments (EDs). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Utilizing data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) from 2019 to 2022, a cross sectional study was employed. The sample consisted of adolescents and young adults aged 15-24 years presenting with cannabis-associated injuries, and also screened for syncope. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cases of cannabis-associated injuries were identified, and those presenting with syncope were analyzed. Epidemiological analyses were conducted to estimate prevalence ratios (PR). RESULTS: Among the study sample of individuals aged 15-24, 24,922 presented with cannabis-associated injuries, with 5400 of those also screening positive for syncope. The majority of injuries treated were to the head and neck, with falls being the most prevalent mechanism of injury. Comparisons between syncopal and non-syncopal injuries revealed distinct clinical profiles, with approximately 21.7 % of cannabis-associated injuries accompanied by syncope. Moreover, the prevalence of syncope among cannabis users was found to be significantly elevated compared to non-cannabis users (PR = 8.6, 95 % CI 7.1-10.2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Syncope is a prevalent condition among adolescents and young adults seeking treatment in emergency departments for cannabis-associated injuries. The clinical relevance of cannabis associated syncope as it pertains to cardiovascular anomalies needs further study. As cannabis legislation, usage patterns, and products continue to evolve, a well informed medical care community will be essential."

Participants were from three states where cannabis use is legal for adults (Washington, Oregon, and California). Themes were generated from implicit and explicit participant responses and principles of Indigenous research frameworks were utilized.Results: Four themes were derived from the data: 1) Perinatal cannabis use as better than other substances, 2) Medicinal use and perceived therapeutic effects of prenatal cannabis, 3) Unsure if cannabis use while breastfeeding impacts the baby, and 4) Minimal responses from healthcare providers perceived as approval.Conclusions: Cannabis was used for health-related issues and was perceived to be a safer option for than use of methamphetamine, heroin, alcohol, and prescription pharmaceuticals. With a focus on other substance use issues within participants' communities, minimal discussion about cannabis use by healthcare providers was perceived as endorsement of use, highlighting the need for additional training for healthcare providers.",

This pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility of conducting a randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial of MC in adolescents with TS. Method: This was a phase I/II double-blind, cross-over pilot study comparing MC with matched placebo in adolescents aged 12-18 years with TS. The active medication was Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 10 mg/mL and CBD 15 mg/mL in peppermint-flavored medium-chain triglyceride oil. The dose titration schedule was stratified into two participant weight bands: below 50 kg (max THC 10 mg/day) or ≥50 kg (max THC 20 mg/day). Each treatment phase lasted 10 weeks, with a 4-week washout period. Results: Ten adolescents were randomized (mean age 14.8 years, 50% male) and seven completed the full study protocol. Two adolescents discontinued due to adverse events (one on MC, one placebo) and one was lost to follow-up. The most common adverse event was dizziness (67%). There were no serious adverse events. Among actively enrolled participants, protocol adherence was excellent: study visits 100%, blood test completions 100%, and online questionnaire completion 97.6%. Medication adherence was acceptable in 63.6%. Parents reported a high degree of study design acceptability. On the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale, three participants were rated as much improved on MC compared with one on placebo at 10 weeks. Discussion: The findings suggest that the study protocol is feasible and acceptable to patients with TS and their families. A fully powered study is needed to evaluate the efficacy of MC in adolescent TS."

METHODS: This was a case series conducted with the UK Medical Cannabis Registry. The primary outcomes were changes in the following validated patient-reported outcome measures at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months compared with baseline: Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ-2), pain visual analog scale score (Pain-VAS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L), Single-Item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS), General Anxiety Disorder Seven-Item Scale (GAD-7), and Patient Global Impression of Change. The incidence of adverse events was analyzed as secondary outcomes. Statistical significance was defined as P <0.050. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients met inclusion criteria. Improvements were observed in BPI severity and interference subscales, SF-MPQ-2, and Pain-VAS (P < 0.001). Changes were also seen in the EQ-5D-5L index value, SQS, and GAD-7 (P < 0.001). A total of 50 patients (31.06%) reported one or more adverse event with a total incidence of 601 (373.29%). The most frequent rating for adverse events was moderate (n = 258; 160.25%), with headache being the most common (n = 44; 27.33%). CONCLUSION: An association was identified between patients with HSD/hEDS with chronic pain and improvements in pain-specific and general health-related quality of life following the commencement of CBMPs. CBMPs were also well tolerated at 18 months. These findings must be interpreted within the context of the limitations of study design but add further weight to calls for randomized controlled trials."

Present evaluations of THC-induced impairment in legal settings rely on biological drug tests that solely establish cannabis use, rather than cannabis impairment. The current study evaluated the metabolome in blood collected from occasional and chronic cannabis users (N = 35) at baseline and following treatments with cannabis (300 μg/kg THC) and placebo, with the aim to identify unique metabolic alterations that are associated with acute cannabis intoxication and cannabis use frequency. Blood samples were collected at baseline and repeatedly during 70 min after treatment. Sustained attention performance and ratings of subjective high were taken twice within 40 min after treatment. Metabolomic fingerprints of occasional and chronic cannabis users were distinctly different at baseline, when both groups were not intoxicated. A total of 14 metabolites, mainly related to endocannabinoid and amino acid metabolism, were identified that distinguished chronic from occasional cannabis users and that yielded a discriminant analysis model with an 80% classification rate (95% CI: 61-91%). Distinct metabolomic fingerprints were found for occasional cannabis users who, in contrast to chronic cannabis users, showed attentional impairment and elevated ratings of subjective high during cannabis intoxication. These included increments in organic acids, β-hydroxybutyrate and second messenger ceramides. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of the metabolomics approach to identify metabolic changes that are specific to the neurocognitive state of cannabis intoxication and to the history of cannabis use.",

This work reports the preparation and characterization of a certified reference material (CRM) for toxic elements-arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb)-in pulverized, lyophilized cannabis leaf tissue. To prepare the CRM INM-040-1, a portion of dried ground cannabis vegetal material was spiked with the elements at mass fraction values close to the levels of interest in relevant regulations for this kind of matrix: 0.34 mg/kg for arsenic, 0.34 mg/kg for cadmium, and 0.66 mg/kg for lead. The elements were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in combination with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS, for cadmium and lead) or hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy (HG-AAS, for arsenic). The analytical calibration was done by gravimetric standard addition for ICP-MS and GF-AAS, while bracketing calibration was used for HG-AAS. Furthermore, internal standard correction was used during ICP-MS measurements. The analytical methods were validated to demonstrate their fitness for purpose. The preparation variables of the CRM (particle size, drying treatment, and spiking conditions) were studied to improve the homogeneity of the CRM. The mass fraction of the toxic elements was certified with relative standard uncertainties ranging from 4.2 to 6.9%. The uncertainty contributions considered were the elements' mass fraction measurements, the between-methods bias, the (in)homogeneity of the production batch, and the (in)stability under transport and storage conditions. This new CRM constitutes a useful tool for the laboratories assessing the harmlessness of cannabis materials, promoting humans' safety and regulatory compliance within the medicinal cannabis industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oncology providers often lack the confidence to make clinical recommendations about medical cannabis (MC). This study aimed to develop and evaluate the feasibility of implementing an educational curriculum on the use of MC in patient care for oncology trainees. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team designed an educational curriculum for MC use in oncology. The curriculum was piloted as a 1-hour interactive webinar across 8 United States-based hematology/oncology fellowship programs between 2022 and 2023. Incentivized surveys measuring feasibility outcomes, including cultural attitudes/norms, acceptability, compatibility, and self-efficacy (a composite index of self-confidence in discussing MC efficacy, risks, modes of use, and role in symptom management), were distributed before, immediately after, and 12 weeks post-webinar. RESULTS: Of 103 trainees, 75 (72.8%) completed the pretraining survey and 66 (64.1%) completed the posttraining survey. Most respondents believed discussions about the role of MC in symptom management were valuable (n=56; 74.7%), though few (14.7%) believed trainees were expected to engage in such discussions. Most participants rated the curriculum as helpful (92.4%), beneficial for oncology trainees (84.8%), and likely to be recommended to colleagues (87.9%). Post-webinar, 78.8% of participants reported an increased likelihood of initiating discussions with patients regarding MC. There were significant improvements in the composite self-confidence index from pre- to post-webinar (2.7% vs 65.2%; P<.001), which persisted in the follow-up surveys (n=36; response rate, 34.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This multisite study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a novel curriculum focused on MC for oncology trainees. These findings can guide the design of a prospective, multi-institutional study to evaluate knowledge expansion, retention, and behavioral changes resulting from the intervention.",

A standardized cannabis extract was selected to evaluate its potential as a chemopreventive agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alternative green solvents, powder-to-solvent ratios, and irradiation cycles were determined to optimize the MAE conditions. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed to assess the cytotoxic effects against human breast cancer (MCF-7), liver cancer (HepG2), and mammary epithelium (hTert-HME1) cell lines. RESULTS: The extracts obtained from D-limonene and palm oil contained the highest concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD) and D-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A standardized D-limonene extract of cannabis (DEC) containing 0.03% w/w CBD and 1.37% w/w THC was selected for the evaluation of cytotoxic activity compared with CBD and THC. The results revealed that CBD and THC exhibited significant cytotoxic effects (p<0.05) against MCF-7 and HepG2, with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 18.5 and 12.37 μg/mL for CBD and 24.21 and 4.30 μg/mL for THC, respectively, whereas DEC exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against MCF-7 (IC50 of 488.85 μg/mL). However, CBD and THC exhibited significant cytotoxicity (p<0.05) against hTert-HME1 (IC50 values of 35.61 and 25.63 μg/mL, respectively), whereas DEC exhibited low cytotoxicity against hTert-HME1 (IC50 of 1.537.03 μg/mL). CONCLUSION: DECs containing appropriate levels of THC and CBD have the potential to be candidates for cancer treatment. However, further investigations are required to improve the efficacy and safety profiles."

Elevated levels of phosphorus (P) are of particular concern. Here we report the effects of increasing P above levels adequate for other crops (15, 30, 45, 60, or 90 mg per L) and the interactive effects of elevated P with elevated nutrient solution concentration (electrical conductivity; 2 and 4 mS per cm). We used closed-system hydroponics to continuously quantify rootzone nutrient concentrations. The concentration of P in leaf tissue doubled and flower P concentration increased 70% when the P input increased from 15 to 90 mg per L but there was no difference in yield or quality among treatments. Doubling nutrient input from 2 to 4 mS per cm increased nutrient accumulation in solution but did not significantly increase yield or quality. Reducing P in the refill solution from 90 to 15 mg per L reduced P in solution at harvest from 300 to less than 0.1 mg per L. Despite the low steady-state concentration of P in solution in the 15 mg per L treatment, there was no difference in yield or quality among treatments, regardless of the concentration of other elements. Despite the high nutrient concentrations in the rootzone solution there was no leaf necrosis or other visual effects among treatments. These data indicate cannabis tolerates high nutrient concentrations, but neither excessive P nor excessive fertilization improves yield or quality."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain affects approximately 30% of the global population, posing a significant public health challenge. Despite their widespread use, traditional pharmacological treatments, such as opioids and NSAIDs, often fail to deliver adequate, long-term relief while exposing patients to risks of addiction and adverse side effects. Given these limitations, medical cannabis has emerged as a promising therapeutic alternative with both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its clinical efficacy is hindered by high interindividual variability in treatment response and elevated dropout rates. METHODS: A comprehensive dataset integrating genetic, clinical, and pharmacological information was compiled from 542 Caucasian patients undergoing cannabis-based treatment for chronic pain. A machine learning (ML) model was developed and validated to predict therapy dropout. To identify the most influential factors driving dropout, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was performed. RESULTS: The random forest classifier demonstrated robust performance, achieving a mean accuracy of 80% and a maximum of 86%, with an AUC of 0.86. SHAP analysis revealed that high final VAS scores and elevated THC dosages were the most significant predictors of dropout, both strongly correlated with an increased likelihood of discontinuation. In contrast, baseline therapeutic benefits, CBD dosages, and the CC genotype of the rs1049353 polymorphism in the CNR1 gene were associated with improved adherence. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the potential of ML and pharmacogenetics to personalize cannabis-based therapies, improving adherence and enabling more precise management of chronic pain. This research paves the way for the development of tailored therapeutic strategies that maximize the benefits of medical cannabis while minimizing its side effects."

      "abstract": "Many medical conditions are accompanied by severe pain. Acute pain refers to the experience of pain that lasts for only a few hours, whereas chronic pain is the ongoing emergence of pain signals over an extended period. Since ancient times, cannabis has been utilized for medical purposes. This article demonstrates the medicinal importance of cannabinoids through their analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Additionally, the mechanisms of cannabinoid-induced analgesia have been interpreted via preclinical investigations in animals. Cannabinoid extracts were formulated into gel and cream at concentrations of 2.5% and 5%. The cannabis cream showed the highest analgesic activity at 5% compared to methyl salicylate as a control. Moreover, cannabis gel produced a comparable anti-inflammatory effect at 5% against the standard diclofenac sodium. Molecular docking studies of all cannabinoids were performed to understand their modes of interaction and binding affinities with the cyclooxygenase II receptor. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulation studies were conducted for for both the ligand-free and cannabidiol-bound cyclooxygenase II to validate the in vivo and molecular docking results. During simulations, the stability of the protein was analyzed using root-mean-square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation. The study of trajectories of the ligand-free and ligand-bound proteins was assessed using radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area. Molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area was used to evaluate the free energies of ligand binding. Dynamic cross-correlation matrix, principal component analysis and free energy landscape characterized the conformational changes and relative energies of them, which shows the existence of two metastable conformations in cyclooxygenase II, one of which is possibly the native state with catalytic activity. In conclusion, the data from this study support the use of medicinal cannabis in the management of pain. To mitigate the suffering of patients experiencing extreme pain, the rational use of cannabis-based drugs merits significant consideration."

Further, few studies to date have examined these relationships in intensive PTSD treatment settings, with existing literature being similarly inconclusive. The present study assessed the role of cannabis use frequency prior to and concurrent with treatment on self-reported PTSD and depressive symptoms in two samples of veterans undergoing distinct (3-week and 2-week) Cognitive Processing Therapy-based intensive treatment programs (ITPs; N3-week = 488; N2-week = 253). METHOD: Cannabis use frequency over the past 2 weeks was self-reported by veterans. PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed before, during, and following the ITP using the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze the effect of cannabis use frequency prior to and concurrent with treatment on PTSD and depressive symptom change over time. RESULTS: Individuals in the 3- and 2-week ITPs reported low rates of cannabis use prior to and concurrent with treatment. Across models, frequency of cannabis use was not significantly related to PTSD symptoms over time. Findings surrounding the impact of cannabis use on depressive symptom severity were only found in the 2-week ITP and not replicated in the 3-week ITP. CONCLUSION: Infrequent and/or recreational cannabis use frequency prior to or concurrent with treatment did not meaningfully impact intensive PTSD treatment outcomes. Findings associated with concurrent use need to be interpreted with caution due to the small subsample. Future research should explore whether more frequent cannabis use and the dosage differentially impact PTSD treatment outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)."

These metanarratives, however, appear to have universalised, medicalised and marginalised the conception and representation of mental illness as enmeshed in local epistemologies and ontologies of mental illness. Based on local epistemologies, elders in Diwa largely trace mental illness to discursive sociocultural explanations rarely linked to cannabis use. This paper answers the central question: How is the use of cannabis by different persons related to mental illness in the Rushinga district? I argue that community members, health providers and police officers want to think of persons, especially men, with mental illness as \"mad\" and immoral cannabis users who brought illnesses upon themselves and lack personal responsibility based on Western neoliberal and biomedical metanarratives. However, this framing is not helpful, it is detrimental to treatment and social reputation, as it bypasses local cultural explanations that may be protective and that offer clearer guidelines for treatment."

This study presents an updated overview of cannabis-specific treatment availability across Europe. Data on treatment programs in 27 EU member states, United Kingdom, Norway and Turkey was gathered. The study used a mixed-methods approach, combining (1) a quantitative survey among the National Focal Points of the European Drugs Agency (EUDA), (2) a qualitative analysis of \"Drug Workbooks 2021\" and 'Treatment Workbooks 2020 and 2021' published by the National Focal Points of the EUDA. Data for 30 countries on the European continent was analyzed. Sixteen countries reported the existence of specific cannabis-specific programs. Fifteen countries provided specific face-to-face interventions, which mostly have limited national coverage. Cannabis-specific online-treatment has been used more systematically since the COVID-pandemic in some countries. Automated and brief web-based interventions have emerged with a large potential to cover the needs of many clients in rural areas. First Cannabis Clinics opened, but specific forms of treatment for vulnerable target groups (e.g. adolescents, people with mental disorders) are generally still rare. Most programs are not evidence-based. In sum, some growth in cannabis-specific treatments has been observed in the past decade in Europe. Their coverage is still limited.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many chemotherapy agents used to treat advanced cancer are inherently mucotoxic, causing breakdown of the gastrointestinal mucosa (gastrointestinal mucositis (GI-M)) and lead to a constellation of secondary complications including diarrhoea, malnutrition, anorexia, pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances. These symptoms are usually managed individually, leading to polypharmacy and its associated risks. The endocannabinoid system regulates numerous biological and behavioural processes associated with chemotherapy side effects, suggesting its modulation could control these symptoms. Therefore, the CANnabinoids in CANcer (CANCAN) therapy trial is a phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to determine the efficacy of medicinal cannabis in minimising GI-M and its associated symptom burden. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CANCAN trial is being conducted at four Australian sites: the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre and the Lyell McEwin Hospital. Adults (n=176) diagnosed with a solid tumour or a haematological cancer scheduled to receive mucotoxic chemotherapy will be eligible. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive either the investigational product (IP) or placebo, both delivered as sublingual wafers. The active IP contains cannabidiol (300 mg/day) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (5-20 mg/day, titrated by the participant). The primary outcome is GI-M burden, determined by the Mucositis Daily Questionnaire. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include overall symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale), anorexia (Average Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy), depression/anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), financial toxicity (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity), quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire), incidence of chemotherapy dose reductions/modifications, cumulative dose of chemotherapy administered, incidence/length of hospitalisation, the use of supportive care, and the cost-benefit of the IP. The CANCAN trial prioritises patient experiences by focusing on patient-reported outcome measures and administering medicinal cannabis during active treatment to prevent symptoms that occur secondary to mucositis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by Central Adelaide Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (2022HRE00037). All participants will be required to provide written or digitally authorised informed consent. Trial results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, and at scientific conferences.

However, previous work examining maintenance models of problematic cannabis use has primarily focused on modeling predictors of cannabis use as measured using static retrospective report rather than examining cannabis use as a series of interactions that unfold in everyday life. In this study, we analyzed ecological momentary assessment data (T = 3,230 observations) from 65 young adults who reported problematic cannabis use (Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test-Revised: M = 10.38, SD = 4.35) and an interest in reducing their use. We used multilevel network analyses to model associations among biopsychosocial factors that aligned with social learning, self-medication, and experiential avoidance theories of substance use. Network models demonstrated consistent associations between socioenvironmental triggers and cannabis cravings, use, and intoxication that were nearly all clinically meaningful in size (bs > 0.10). Results indicated a statistically significant association between negative and positive affect with cannabis use and intoxication, respectively; however, these associations were not clinically meaningful in size. There were no clinically meaningful associations between coping strategies and cannabis use variables. Findings advance our understanding of cannabis use in everyday life, which is critical for refining more dynamic conceptualization of substance use and improving the precision of clinical assessments.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use is prevalent among adults who drink alcohol and is associated with more negative consequences than use of either substance alone. Understanding reinforcement processes that maintain simultaneous versus single-substance use will highlight intervention targets specific to this pattern of use. In individuals' daily lives, we tested whether simultaneous use moments are associated with more affectively reinforcing outcomes compared to single use moments. METHODS: We used ecological momentary assessment with 6 +  daily reports for 14 days. Participants were 88 adults ages 18-44 who reported simultaneous use at least twice per week. Mean age was 25.22 years and participants were 60.2 % female. At each momentary survey, participants reported alcohol and cannabis use, affect, momentary coping and enhancement motives, and subjective appraisals of use. RESULTS: Simultaneously using cannabis during alcohol-use moments attenuated the increase in negative affect that accompanied coping-motivated drinking (anxious mood b = -0.11, 95 % CI = [-0.19, -0.02], p = .016; depressed mood b = -0.14, 95 % CI = [-0.23, -0.05], p = .003). Simultaneously using cannabis during alcohol-use moments attenuated the positive association between enhancement drinking motives and subjective drinking-contingent pleasure (b = -0.34, 95 % CI = [-0.50, -0.18], p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneously using cannabis during alcohol-use moments altered the subjective effects of alcohol, whereas simultaneously consuming alcohol during cannabis-use moments did not alter the subjective effects of cannabis. Individuals may perceive that simultaneous cannabis use mitigates undesirable effects of coping-motivated drinking, thereby driving simultaneous use of cannabis alongside alcohol.",

It is unclear whether opioids and/or cannabis affect the treatment response to neuromodulators. The aims of this study were to assess: (i) the prevalence of opioid and cannabis use among outpatients with CVS, (ii) clinical characteristics associated with opioid/cannabis use and response to a three-tiered neuromodulator treatment algorithm, and (iii) the effect of opioid/cannabis cessation on response to the treatment algorithm. METHODOLOGY: Data from consecutive patients newly diagnosed with Rome IV CVS at a single tertiary care neurogastroenterology outpatient clinic (January 2016-June 2024) were retrospectively collected. Patients were advised to stop consuming opioids and/or cannabis and commenced a low-dose TCA. RESULTS: Sixty-one (46/75) percent of outpatients with CVS responded to the three-tiered treatment algorithm. Among responders, 42 (91%) patients responded to TCA alone (1st line therapy), 3 (7%) patients responded to TCA and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (2nd line therapy), and 1 (2%) patient required topiramate (3rd line therapy). The mean [SD] dosage of TCA among responders was 26.5 [18.3] mg. Twenty-five (33%) patients consumed opioids, 14 (19%) took cannabis, and five (7%) consumed both opioids and cannabis. While opioid cessation was associated with clinical response to the treatment algorithm (p = 0.03), opioid intake at the initial consultation was not (p = 0.2). Irritable bowel syndrome was independently associated with significantly greater odds (OR [95% CI]) of opioid consumption at baseline (6.59 [1.49-29.24], p = 0.01). Heartburn was independently associated with lower odds of response to the treatment algorithm (0.2 [0.05-0.65], p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Low-dose neuromodulators, along with opioid and cannabis cessation, may be important strategies in the management of CVS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis sativa L. with a rich history of traditional medicinal use, has garnered significant attention in contemporary research for its potential therapeutic applications in various human diseases, including pain, inflammation, cancer, and osteoarthritis. However, the specific molecular targets and mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of its diverse phytochemical constituents remain elusive. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted, effective cannabis-based therapies. METHODS: To investigate the molecular targets and pathways involved in the synergistic effects of cannabis compounds, we utilized DRIFT, a deep learning model that leverages attention-based neural networks to predict compound-target interactions. We considered both whole plant extracts and specific plant-based formulations. Predicted targets were then mapped to the Reactome pathway database to identify the biological processes affected. To facilitate the prediction of molecular targets and associated pathways for any user-specified cannabis formulation, we developed CANDI (Cannabis-derived compound Analysis and Network Discovery Interface), a web-based server. This platform offers a user-friendly interface for researchers and drug developers to explore the therapeutic potential of cannabis compounds. RESULTS: Our analysis using DRIFT and CANDI successfully identified numerous molecular targets of cannabis compounds, many of which are involved in pathways relevant to pain, inflammation, cancer, and other diseases. The CANDI server enables researchers to predict the molecular targets and affected pathways for any specific cannabis formulation, providing valuable insights for developing targeted therapies. CONCLUSIONS: By combining computational approaches with knowledge of traditional cannabis use, we have developed the CANDI server, a tool that allows us to harness the therapeutic potential of cannabis compounds for the effective treatment of various disorders. By bridging traditional pharmaceutical development with cannabis-based medicine, we propose a novel approach for botanical-based treatment modalities."

The purpose of this study was to assess the evolution of the prevalence of drug use in the young population in Spain, as well as the impact it currently has on our social and health care system. METHODS: A national observational descriptive study was carried out in students aged fourteen-eighteen years living in Spain. The data sources used were: ESTUDES survey; Evolutionary data from Intelligence Center against Terrorism and Organized Crime (CITCO) on THC content in cannabis plants and resin; State Information System on Drugs and Addictions (SEIDA) indicators: Admissions to treatment and Hospital emergencies related to the consumption of psychoactive substances. The data obtained were processed with the statistical program SPSS version 28.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Continuous variables were described using measures of central tendency and dispersion, while categorical variables were described using absolute frequencies and percentages. To compare independent means, Student's t-test was applied and for the comparison of categorical variables, the chi-square statistical test was used; in both cases differences with p<0.001 were considered significant. RESULTS: In the last year, 21.8% of the students consumed cannabis. A total of 92.3% of the admissions to treatment were for this substance. Cannabis was present in 57.3% of emergencies related to illegal drug use. CONCLUSIONS: As is the case in Europe, cannabis continues to be the illegal drug most widely consumed by young people in our country; it is responsible for most of the social and health adverse consequences of the consumption of illegal substances in young people.",

      "abstract": "Pain is highly prevalent among emerging adults (18-25 years old), and rates of cannabis use are increasing among this population. Research indicates pain is a unique risk factor and motivator for substance use. However, evidence for pain-cannabis use relations among emerging adults is largely cross-sectional, and the only prospective evidence focuses on the frequency, quantity, and consequences of cannabis use, not initiation. Accordingly, this is the first study to examine pain as a prospective predictor of cannabis initiation among emerging adults. Data were drawn from five annual waves of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. Emerging adults who denied cannabis use at baseline (n = 4,185) were included in the analysis. At baseline, a tenth of emerging adults reported moderate/severe pain (≥4/10). Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that emerging adults with moderate/severe baseline pain were more likely to initiate cannabis use, and did so earlier over the subsequent 4 years, than those with no/low baseline pain. These findings provide initial evidence for pain as a risk factor for cannabis initiation during emerging adulthood. Future research is needed to identify mechanisms by which pain motivates cannabis initiation and to examine the utility of pain-targeted content in cannabis use prevention and intervention efforts among emerging adults."

From the GC-MS analysis, the following bioactive compounds were found: cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and humulene. The antiproliferative activities of the extract were determined on HeLa cells by using MTT, Crystal Violet, and Trypan Blue assays with an IC50 value suggesting 51%-77.6% lethality. The bioinformatics analysis of molecular docking proved significant ligand-protein interactions of CBD, THC, and humulene with cancer-associated proteins such as PD-1/PD-L1, TNF-α, and MMP-9. In vivo, breast cancer was first established in female Sprague-Dawley rats with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) then treated with cannabinoids either singularly or in combination. Detailed treatment demonstrated that the use of the three cannabinoids simultaneously yielded the best anticancer and anti-inflammatory outcomes together with the best tumor reduction. The concentration of serum biomarkers of inflammation and tumor progression was substantially reduced in treated groups compared to the control group, which proves the synergistic effects of these cannabinoids in breast cancer therapy. This study emphasizes the importance of medical Cannabis sativa derivatives in cancer treatment."

The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts from five cultivars of hemp, namely, Bialobrzeskie, Felina 32, Futura 75, mixed and Santhica 27, against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. All five cultivars exhibited a certain degree of inhibitory effect against all the pathogens tested with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 128 to 2048 μg/mL. The extract from the Santhica 27 cultivar was the most effective antibacterial agent with the lowest MIC value of 128 μg/mL against Str. agalactiae and two clinical isolates of S. aureus, followed by Bialobrzeskie and mixed cultivars with the same growth-inhibitory potential against Str. agalactiae. The extracts from the Felina 32 and Futura 75 cultivars presented only weak activity with MIC values ranging from 256 to 2048 μg/mL. The extract from the Santhica 27 cultivar appears to be a promising product for future use in the treatment of staphylococcal and streptococcal infections in livestock."

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of MC as an adjunctive therapy for moderate PTSD under varying reimbursement scenarios. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted from the US payor perspective, using pricing data from the largest multi-state MC producer and established literature on standard PTSD treatments. We analyzed eight MC product types: dried flower, oral solutions, tablets, and edibles, each available in low/moderate (LM) and high-cost formulations. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated for these products across reimbursement levels of 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to assess cost-effectiveness acceptability across willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $0-$100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Non-flower MC products (edibles, oral solutions, and tablets) consistently demonstrated cost-effectiveness under a WTP threshold of $50,000, even at 100% reimbursement. Dried flower products, while less cost effective due to higher costs, achieved cost effectiveness under 75% or lower reimbursement levels for LM cost formulations. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robust ICURs for non-flower products, with narrower variability compared to dried flower products. CONCLUSIONS: Medical cannabis products, particularly non-flower formulations, represent a cost-effective adjunctive therapy for moderate PTSD under various reimbursement scenarios. This analysis underscores the importance of evidence-based reimbursement policies to improve patient access to cost-effective treatments while ensuring financial sustainability for payors.",

METHOD: Given this, the present study examined the acute effects of vaporized cannabis flower on measures of hazard perception, driving-related risk-taking behaviors, and subjective perceptions of driving skills in a sample of adult medicinal cannabis patients. Participants (N = 38, M age = 43) attended both a baseline (no cannabis) and intervention appointment (with cannabis consumption), where they completed video-based tasks and self-report measures of driving ability. RESULTS: After vaporizing one dose of their prescribed cannabis flower, participants exhibited no significant changes in performance on any of the video-based tasks (hazard perception skill, gap acceptance, following distance or speed) compared to baseline. However, cannabis consumption resulted in significant reductions in perceived hazard perception task performance and on-road traffic conflict prediction ability. Furthermore, there was a lack of association between objective and subjective hazard perception performance at both time points. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: These results suggest that while acute prescribed cannabis consumption may reduce appraisals of selected skills, overall hazard perception ability and driving-related risk-taking behavior may remain unchanged.",

Given the increasing prevalence of cannabis use among PWH, we investigated its potential to reduce chronic inflammation and enhance gut health, both of which can influence HIV pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Cannabis has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, including reducing systemic inflammatory biomarkers (such as MCP-1 and IP-10) and improving gut barrier integrity through increased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Studies have shown that cannabis use is associated with increased gut mucosal immunity, decreased immune activation, and a unique microbiome composition. Preliminary evidence indicates that cannabis may influence HIV reservoirs, although the results remain inconclusive.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As many as 40% of adults who smoke (AWS) use cannabis, yet little is known about how cigarette-cannabis (CIG-CAN) use impacts change in cigarette and other tobacco product (OTP) use during a quit attempt. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of a smoking cessation randomized clinical trial (RCT) that enrolled 392 Black adults who wanted to quit cigarettes and were provided 18 weeks of standard or adapted pharmacotherapy. Participants self-reported cigarettes, cannabis, and OTP at W0,2,6,12,18, and 26. Longitudinal modeling of group, time, and group by time effects compared change in cigarettes, cannabis, and OTP between those who did and did not use cannabis. RESULTS: Nearly half (47.2%,185/392) were CIG-CAN users. Cannabis types were joints (78.4%) and blunts (51.9%). Significant reduction in CPD over time (p=0.02) did not differ by group (p=0.18). OTP had significant group, group by time interaction and time effect (p<0.001), however, OTP use is small and had minimal effect on consumption. CIG-CAN increased cannabis use through week 26 (p<0.001). When CPD decreased, there was a compensatory effect on OTP (<.0001), but not cannabis (p=0.37). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of cannabis use was high among Black adults attempting to quit cigarette smoking in an RCT. OTP use was minimal, but CIG-CAN maintained higher OTP and increased consumption of cannabis while having similar reductions in CPD. Findings require replication in a prospectively designed study but suggest a pattern of compensation, primarily with cannabis, among CIG-CAN that may limit potential health benefit of cigarette reduction and could compromise future attempts at cessation. IMPLICATIONS: This study's findings suggest a large percentage of cannabis use (47%) and within those users an increase of other tobacco products. At the same time, participants reduced cigarettes per day in both those who did and did not use cannabis. These findings reinforce the need for targeted treatment of all combustible products. Clinical practice guidelines and empirically informed interventions to address CIG-CAN co-use are absent in the field and urgently needed. In addition, better assessment of CIG-CAN in clinical studies is needed to aid in understanding the health impact of co-use."

This study aims to assess the patterns of medical cannabis use in patients over 50 years of age and its effect on health outcomes such as pain, sleep, quality of life, and co-medication. METHOD: The Medical Cannabis in Older Patients Study (MCOPS) is a multi-site, prospective observational study examining the real-world impact of medical cannabis use on patients over age 50 under the guidance of a health care provider. The study included validated instruments, with treating physicians collecting detailed data on participant characteristics, medical cannabis and co-medication use, and associated impacts on pain, sleep, quality of life, as well as adverse events. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 299 participants. Average age of participants was 66.7 years, and 66.2% of respondents identified as female. Approximately 90% of patients used medical cannabis to treat pain-related conditions such as chronic pain and arthritis. Almost all patients reported a preference for oral cannabis products (e.g., extracts, edibles) rather than inhalation products (e.g., flower, vapes), and most preferred oral formulations high in cannabidiol and low in tetrahydrocannabinol. Over the six-month study period, significant improvements were noted in pain, sleep, and quality of life measures, with 45% experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement in pain interference and in sleep quality scores. Additionally, nearly 50% of patients taking co-medications at baseline had reduced their use by the end of the study period, and quality of life improved significantly from baseline to M3 and from baseline to M6, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of $25,357.20. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older patients, most of whom suffered from pain-related conditions, medical cannabis seemed to be a safe and effective treatment. Most patients experienced clinically significant improvements in pain, sleep, and quality of life and reductions in co-medication. The cost per QALY was well below the standard for traditional pharmaceuticals, and no SAEs were reported, suggesting that cannabis is a relatively safe and cost-effective therapeutic option for adults dealing with age-related health conditions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the longer-term impacts of recreational cannabis markets on cannabis use among adolescents and adults across five U.S. states. METHOD: Drawing on state-level data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, this study uses a novel method of causal inference called the synthetic control method with staggered treatment adoption to estimate the pooled effect of recreational markets on prevalence and initiation of use in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Nevada. Three separate models were used for those 12-17, 18-25, and 26 and older. Pre-treatment state-level characteristics and trends in cannabis use were used to generate synthetic control weights. Confidence intervals were constructed using a leave-one-out jackknifing method. RESULTS: Synthetic controls and treated states were similar in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, prevalence of other drug use, and trends in cannabis use prior to the implementation of recreational markets. The study results revealed moderate increases in prevalence and initiation of use among adolescents aged 12-17 (11% and 13%, respectively), and large increases in prevalence and initiation of use among young adults aged 18-25 (17% and 33%, respectively) and older adults aged 26 and older (33% and 82%, respectively) 2-4 years after dispensaries became operational. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest recreational cannabis markets have increased prevalence and initiation of cannabis use among adolescents and adults. These increases may lead to adverse health outcomes depending on factors such as frequency of use and characteristics of users."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Almost half of U.S. states have passed recreational cannabis laws as of May 2024. While considerable evidence to date indicates cannabis may be a substitute for prescription opioids in the treatment of pain, it remains unclear if patients are treating pain with cannabis alone or concomitantly with other medications. METHOD: Using data from a national sample of commercially insured adults, we examine the effect of recreational cannabis legalization (through two sequential policies) on prescribing of opioids, NSAIDS, and other pain medications by implementing synthetic control estimations and constructing case-study level counterfactuals for the years 2007-2020. RESULTS: Overall, we find recreational cannabis legalization is associated with a decrease in opioid fills among commercially insured adults in the U.S., and we find evidence of a compositional change in prescriptions of pain medications more broadly. Specifically, we find marginally significant increases in prescribing of non-opioid pain medications after recreational cannabis becomes legal in some states. Once recreational cannabis dispensaries open, we find statistically significant decreases in the rate of opioid prescriptions (13% reduction from baseline, p < .05) and marginally significant decreases in the average daily supply of opioids (6.3% decrease, p < .10) and number of opioid prescriptions per patient (3.5% decrease, p < .10). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that substitution of cannabis for traditional pain medications increases as the availability of recreational cannabis increases. There appears to be a small shift once recreational cannabis becomes legal, but we see stronger results once users can purchase cannabis at recreational dispensaries. The decrease in opioids and marginal increase in non-opioid pain medication may reflect patients substituting opioids with cannabis and non-opioid pain medications, either separately or concomitantly. Reductions in opioid prescription fills stemming from recreational cannabis legalization may prevent exposure to opioids in patients with pain and lead to decreases in the number of new opioid users, rates of opioid use disorder, and related harms."

We assessed how self-reported financial well-being is associated with patterns of cannabis consumption, out-of-pocket costs, and impact on symptoms in patients with cancer. METHOD: From December 2021 to January 2022, we surveyed patients with cancer enrolled in the Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program. The mailed survey included cancer history, cannabis use history, symptom changes and sociodemographic questions including income and perceived financial wellness. We conducted descriptive analyses. RESULTS: Of 797 eligible adults, 220 (28%) responded to the survey. Two hundred eleven answered a question about current household income as living comfortably (LC, 45%; n = 95) or not living comfortably (NLC, 55%; n = 116). The NLC group reported lower incomes (47% vs 8% with annual incomes <$50,000) and were typically younger, unmarried, unemployed, or disabled. NLC group purchased more vaporizers (48% vs 27%), used products high in THC (92% vs 82%), and reported higher cannabis costs (40% vs 21% spending $200+/month). The NLC group more often stopped or used cannabis less frequently than they would like (54% versus 32%), frequently citing costs as a reason (85% vs 39%). Both NLC and LC groups typically used cannabis daily and reported a high degree of symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer using cannabis report significant improvements in cancer-related symptoms. High out-of-pocket costs for cannabis may be especially burdensome among those already financially struggling, raising questions about affordability of and equitable access to this therapy."

Although previous research has linked perceived peer approval, perceptions of dangerousness, and negative effect expectancies to DACU, no previous work has examined whether these constructs can be successfully targeted in an intervention or whether changes in these variables lead to changes in DACU. The present study is a secondary data analysis to investigate within-subject change and potential mechanisms of change in a pilot trial for a mobile phone-based intervention shown to significantly reduce DACU over time. METHOD: Participants were 66 emerging adults who completed the mobile-based intervention and provided 3-month follow-up data. Participants completed measures that assessed rates of DACU, negative cannabis expectancies, perceptions of dangerousness, and perceived peer-approval. RESULTS: Results indicated that negative effect expectancies significantly increased from baseline to three-month follow-up, while perceived peer approval for DACU significantly decreased from baseline to three-month follow-up. Though significant within-subject change was found for all variables of interest, none of the variables of interest significantly mediated changes in instances of DACU over time. The results of the current study suggest that key variables associated with DACU-perceived peer approval and negative cannabis expectancies can be successfully targeted in a mobile-based brief intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Continued research investigating moderators and mediators of intervention outcomes is warranted."

However, in Morocco, the ethnobotanical applications of Cannabis sativa, especially its essential oils, are underexplored. This study investigates, for the first time, the effects of Moroccan Cannabis sativa essential oil on peripheral neuropathic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral neuropathic pain was induced in mice through sciatic nerve injury. The mice were treated daily with cannabis essential oil for 21 days. Behavioral tests were conducted on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 to evaluate thermal, mechanical, and cold sensitivity. The essential oil's chemical composition was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). RESULTS: The main constituents of the essential oil were (E)-caryophyllene (41.59%) and α-humulene (14%). Daily treatment with the essential oil significantly reduced pain sensitivity and improved functional and histological recovery over time. These effects are linked to the activity of the dominant terpenoids in the oil. CONCLUSION: Moroccan Cannabis sativa essential oil shows significant therapeutic potential for managing peripheral neuropathic pain. By enhancing recovery and alleviating pain symptoms, it offers a promising alternative for treating chronic pain caused by nerve injuries.",

Cannabis sativa extract (CSE) has been reported to exhibit analgesic properties across various pain models; however, the underlying mechanisms of action are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of the cannabinoid CB2 receptor in mediating the analgesic effects of CSE in a rat model of NP, where NP was induced in male Wistar rats through chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Rats were randomly allocated into four groups: (1) Sham + vehicle, (2) CCI + vehicle, (3) CCI + CSE, and (4) CCI + CSE + AM630 (a CB2 receptor antagonist). CSE was administered intraperitoneally at a dosage of 30 mg/kg once daily for 7 days, starting from day 7 to day 13 post-CCI surgery. To assess the involvement of the CB2 receptor, 7 µg of AM630 was administered intrathecally to the rats in group 4, 30 minutes before the CSE injections. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed using the von Frey filament and hot plate tests, respectively, at baseline (day 0) and on days 3, 7, 10, and 14 after surgery. Additionally, at the end of the study period (day 14), the expression level of Iba1 and GFAP genes was quantified in the lumbar enlargement tissues using real-time PCR. The results demonstrated that CCI surgery induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, along with the upregulation of Iba1 and GFAP genes in the vehicle-treated CCI group. Treatment with CSE significantly mitigated both allodynia and hyperalgesia and downregulated the expression of Iba1 and GFAP genes compared to the CCI + vehicle group. Furthermore, the administration of the CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 not only robustly blocked the antinociceptive effects of CSE but also reversed the significant downregulation of Iba1 and GFAP gene expression in the lumbar enlargement tissues. These findings highlight the novel role of the CB2 receptor in mediating the analgesic effects of CSE, providing new insights into the potential therapeutic mechanisms of CSE in neuropathic pain management.",

Sexual minoritized women (SMW) report significant substance use disparities related to sexual minority stress, yet little is known about daily associations between substance use (alcohol or cannabis used independently or concurrently) and affect or how those associations may be moderated by sexual identity. We examined whether daily positive or negative affect was associated with use of alcohol only, cannabis only, or concurrent (i.e., same-day) use and whether those associations varied by sexual identity (SMW vs. heterosexual; bisexual vs. lesbian or heterosexual). METHOD: Women (N = 246; 18-35 years; 88 lesbian, 84 bisexual, 74 heterosexual) completed once-daily surveys for consecutive 12 weeks. RESULTS: Mixed-effects multinomial logistic regression analyses found that alcohol only and concurrent use were more likely on days when women reported greater positive affect, and this association was stronger for heterosexual than SMW. Women who reported higher mean negative affect were more likely to report cannabis use (but not alcohol or concurrent use) on a given day. SMW were more likely than heterosexual women to report alcohol only and concurrent use days, with bisexual women more likely than heterosexual women to report concurrent use days. CONCLUSIONS: Additional research is needed to understand intervening mechanisms in relationships between affect and substance use at the daily level among SMW. Results are needed to inform intervention efforts to reduce substance use in this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "Alcohol and cannabis are the first and second most used substances among adolescents. Adolescence is a period of considerable development, making the adolescent brain particularly vulnerable to negative effects of alcohol and cannabis use. Developing and testing interventions that target both alcohol and cannabis use during adolescence are vital to decreasing costly consequences. Biases in cognitive processing of drug-related stimuli play an important role in the development and maintenance of problematic substance use. The Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) is a computerized program, effective in assessing implicit approach biases for both alcohol and cannabis, in which participants make approach or avoidance movements in response to an irrelevant feature of an image presented on a screen (e.g., push when in portrait, pull when in landscape). A modified version of the AAT is also used as an approach bias modification (ApBM) intervention, to retrain participants' implicit biases toward or away from stimuli by presenting the target stimuli predominantly in one format (e.g., push or pull). Despite research demonstrating the effectiveness of AAT interventions to reduce problematic alcohol and cannabis use, there is a dearth of research examining this intervention among adolescents. This protocol paper describes a NIDA-funded randomized control trial (RCT) to evaluate an integrated mobile ApBM intervention to target co-occurring alcohol and cannabis use among treatment-seeking adolescents. Outcomes will be measured from pre-treatment through a three-month follow-up. The sampling procedures, assessment protocol, description of the intervention, and planned statistical approaches to evaluating outcomes are detailed. Clinical and research implications of this work are also discussed."

Parents are often the first to observe the potential impacts of cannabis use and are essential in recognizing early warning signs, facilitating treatment, and supporting recovery. However, limited research has examined the perspectives of parents whose children experience severe mental health challenges following cannabis use. To explore parent perspectives, the research team conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 13 parents who reported their children used cannabis and experienced mental health issues. Interviews were transcribed and dual coded. A deductive-inductive thematic analysis was used to generate themes. Four themes were identified including (1) cannabis use and mental health, (2) impact on parents and families, (3) treatment experiences, and (4) system recommendations. Parents described how their children's cannabis use either worsened or appeared to trigger severe mental health crises, which increased emotional and financial burdens on their families. Many encountered health care providers who minimized cannabis-related risks, leading to inadequate support during treatment-seeking efforts. Parents also emphasized a lack of public health warnings and insufficient regulatory oversight, calling for better-informed clinicians and more robust public health messaging. These findings highlight an urgent need for family-supportive behavioral health interventions and regulatory reforms to address cannabis-related mental health issues among YYAs.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Despite the critical role of choice processes in substance use disorders, the neurobehavioral mechanisms guiding human decisions about drugs remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize the neural encoding of subjective value (SV) for cannabis versus non-drug rewards (snacks) in people who use cannabis on a near-daily/daily frequency (PWUCF) and assessed the impact of cannabis and snack stimuli ('cues') on SV encoding. METHODS: Twenty-one non-treatment-seeking PWUCF (≥4 days/week; 1 female) participated in an inpatient, crossover experiment with four counterbalanced conditions: 1. neutral cues/cannabis choices; 2. cannabis cues/cannabis choices; 3. neutral cues/snack choices; and 4. snack cues/snack choices. In each condition, participants were exposed to cues before an fMRI scan during which they repeatedly chose between 0-6 cannabis puffs/snacks and a set monetary amount, with randomly-selected choices implemented. The SV signal was operationalized as the neural correlates of the strength of preference for cannabis/snack choices. fMRI data were analyzed for twenty participants. RESULTS: Despite equivalent choice behavior, SV signals for cannabis, but not snacks, were observed in regions known to encode SV for various rewards (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, vmPFC; ventral striatum; dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, dPCC). SV encoding in vmPFC was stronger for cannabis than snacks. In the dPCC, the impact of cues on SV signals was moderated by reward type. CONCLUSIONS: PWUCF had expected neural value encoding for cannabis but disrupted non-drug SV encoding, despite equivalent choice behavior. This provides tentative support for theories that highlight dysregulated neural valuation of non-drug rewards as a hallmark of problematic cannabis use.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the experiences of a novel adjunctive medical cannabis (MC) intervention within a residential substance use recovery program. METHOD: This qualitative study included interviews and validated self-report with clients (n=14) at baseline, one month and three months after receiving adjunct medical cannabis treatment in addition to standard of care. Interviews with program staff (n=7) supplemented assessment of barriers and facilitators to program delivery. RESULTS: Clients reported that the cannabis substitution program demonstrates promise to help reduce problematic substance use by reducing drug cravings and assisting with pain and other comorbid symptoms. The program also helped to destigmatize medical cannabis use. Staff reports highlighted the importance of MC education, clear guidelines for dispensing MC, and an accessible framework for program delivery to facilitate effective uptake of this novel intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility of integrating MC in a supportive residential recovery program. Important factors for success include provision of cannabis education, developing a clear organizational framework and establishing evidence-informed policies within the context of substitution therapy and harm reduction. Further research to more formally evaluate integrating MC in residential substance use treatment is encouraged."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most widely used drug in the world, and the therapies proposed to help withdrawal are moderately effective. The MACBETH project is a pilot study in France. It evaluates the effectiveness of the mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) protocol for active cannabis users. METHODS: It comprises of two groups, an MBRP group and a Treatment As Usual (TAU) group, each with twenty participants. The primary endpoint reflects the frequency of cannabis use, and some secondary endpoints were evaluated (signs of withdrawal, adherence to treatment, and changes in consumption). RESULTS: We found no significant difference between the two groups on the primary and secondary endpoints. We found one significant difference in the MBRP group by further analysis for treatment adherence via an indirect criterion, the attendance at all sessions (P-value=0.01). The number of units consumed from week 1 to week 8 significantly differed in the MBRP group (P-value<0.05) but not in the TAU group. The average number of units consumed from week 8 to 12 increased by 1.5 in the MBRP group compared with 3.4 in the TAU group. The MBRP protocol appears to be at least as effective as the TAU protocol on the assessed criteria, and the results seem to be more durable, although not significant (P-value=0.2). CONCLUSIONS: The MBRP protocol shows interesting results compared to TAU in this major public health problem. Further studies could deepen this field of research, especially by following samples over the long-term and measuring cravings. The MBRP protocol is proving to be an effective and serious alternative psychotherapy to drug therapies in the world of addiction."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cannabis is commonly used among patients with cancer for palliative benefit. As the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for cancer therapy increases, there is concern about potential interactions between ICIs and cannabis. Preclinical studies suggest that cannabis leads to immunosuppression, which could impair the function of ICIs. However, only a few clinical studies have investigated this relationship. The goal of this review is to synthesize reported immunomodulatory effects of cannabis in patients with and without cancer in order to better understand whether these preclinical findings translate to the clinical space. METHODS: A database search was conducted through Ovid Medline to identify relevant articles. Clinical studies investigating cannabis use in humans and the immune system were included. Preclinical studies and case studies were excluded. Information pertaining to immune changes with cannabis exposure was abstracted. RESULTS: Forty studies met inclusion criteria, including 9 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Analysis of immune-related markers demonstrated no change in cytokines, T-cell counts, and CRP in most studies with cannabis exposure. Among patients with autoimmune diseases, cannabis use showed improvements in clinical symptoms even while objective laboratory immune markers remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of meaningful changes in immune parameters with cannabis use in the clinical setting across multiple diseases. In particular, immune markers relevant to ICI function did not appear to be associated with cannabis use. This evidence may provide some reassurance to patients and oncologists contemplating concomitant cannabis use with ICIs; however, additional well-controlled prospective studies are warranted in this setting.",

Cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs) have shown analgesic effects, but their efficacy in CP remains contentious. This study aims to evaluate the change in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and adverse events (AEs) in CP patients treated with CBMPs. A case series was conducted using prospectively collected clinical data from the UK Medical Cannabis Registry. Primary outcomes were the changes in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), pain visual analogue scale (Pain-VAS), EQ-5D-5L, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and Single-Item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) questionnaires from baseline to 1, 3, and 6 months. AEs were recorded and graded. p < 0.050 was considered statistically significant. One hundred and sixty-eight participants were included. CBMPs were associated with improvements in all pain-specific PROMs at all follow-up periods (p < 0.050). Improvements in GAD-7, SQS, and EQ-5D-5L index scores were also observed (p < 0.050). Twenty-nine AEs (17.26%) were reported by five patients (2.98%), mostly mild-to-moderate (72.41%). Although the observational design means causality cannot be established, the findings support the development of future randomized controlled trials into CP management with CBMPs."

      "abstract": "Cannabis use disorder is particularly prevalent and impairing among young people, and evidence-based treatments are limited. Prior trials of N-acetylcysteine, added to contingency management as a platform behavioral intervention, yielded positive findings in youth but not in adults. This trial sought to rigorously evaluate whether N-acetylcysteine is efficacious in youth when not paired with a robust behavioral treatment platform. Treatment-seeking youth with cannabis use disorder (N = 192, ages 14-21) were randomized to receive a double-blind 12-week course of oral N-acetylcysteine 1200 mg or placebo twice daily; all received weekly medical management and brief behavioral counseling. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of negative urine cannabinoid tests during treatment, compared between groups. An array of self-report and urine testing measures were examined secondarily to assess cannabis use reduction and cessation outcomes. The N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups did not differ in proportion of negative urine cannabinoid tests (RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.53, 1.64; p = 0.80) or self-reported cannabis abstinence (RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.63, 1.65; p = 0.93) during treatment. The mean percentage of cannabis use days and grams of cannabis used per using day decreased over time during treatment but did not differ between groups. More N-acetylcysteine than placebo treated participants reported gastrointestinal adverse events (63/98 versus 37/94, χ21 = 11.9 p < 0.001); adverse events were otherwise similar between groups. Findings indicate that N-acetylcysteine is not efficacious for youth cannabis use disorder when not paired with contingency management, highlighting the potentially crucial role of a robust behavioral treatment platform in facilitating prior positive efficacy findings with N-acetylcysteine.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03055377.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is common, particularly during emerging adulthood when brain development is ongoing, and its use is associated with harmful outcomes for a subset of people. An improved understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk for problem-level use is critical to facilitate the development of more effective prevention and treatment approaches. METHODS: In the current study, we applied a whole-brain, data-driven, machine learning approach to identify neural features predictive of problem-level cannabis use in a nonclinical sample of college students (n = 191, 58% female) based on reward task functional connectivity data. We further examined whether the identified network would generalize to predict cannabis use in an independent sample of European adolescents/emerging adults (n = 1320, 53% female), whether it would predict clinical characteristics among adults seeking treatment for cannabis use disorder (n = 33, 9% female), and whether it was specific for predicting cannabis versus alcohol use outcomes across datasets. RESULTS: Results demonstrated identification of a problem cannabis risk network, which generalized to predict cannabis use in an independent sample of adolescents and was linked to increased addiction severity and poorer treatment outcome in a third sample of treatment-seeking adults. Furthermore, the identified network was specific for predicting cannabis versus alcohol use outcomes across all 3 datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide insight into neural mechanisms of risk for problem-level cannabis use among adolescents/emerging adults. Future work is needed to assess whether targeting this network can improve prevention and treatment outcomes."

Consultants can prescribe specific cannabis-based products for a restricted set of indications in Ireland, with neurologists being at the forefront of therapy. Much debate on the therapeutic potential/efficacy of such cannabis-based products exists. AIM: The objective of this study was to conduct a national survey to determine the perspectives/views of Irish neurologists regarding the use of cannabis-based medicines. METHODS: An online anonymous survey was conducted to capture the perspectives and experiences of neurologists in Ireland regarding cannabis-based therapeutics. RESULTS: Thirty-four neurologists completed the survey in full, with study participants rating their knowledge of cannabis-based medicines as average. Data presented herein indicate that there is a need for educational programmes on the cannabinoid system and cannabinoid-based medicines, and the findings indicate that neurologists are interested in the use of cannabinoid-based medicines in their practice. Study participants were more divided with regard to the clarity of the process for accessing cannabis-based medicines, and the consensus is that the application process is unclear. Approximately one-third of participants have made an application to access medicinal cannabis-based products on behalf of a patient. CONCLUSIONS: Data presented herein indicates that the majority of neurologists surveyed are aware of the current systems in place to access cannabis-based products for medicinal use in Ireland and that some engagement with these systems has taken place. A key finding is that educational programmes on the cannabinoid system and cannabis-based medicines are required.",

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed progressively bloodier returns during lavage, consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). This case highlights DAH as a rare but severe complication associated with cannabis use. DAH involves bleeding into the alveolar spaces, impairing gas exchange and causing respiratory distress. While cannabis use is not a well-established cause, this case underscores its potential to trigger serious respiratory complications. Recurrent DAH episodes can lead to long-term complications, such as interstitial fibrosis and emphysema, resulting in obstructive spirometry patterns. Acute complications, including shock, renal failure, and barotrauma, further highlight the critical need for early intervention. Raising awareness among healthcare providers about the potential link between cannabis use and DAH is essential for prompt recognition and management, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This case adds to the limited literature on cannabis-induced DAH, emphasizing its clinical significance."

Studies have shown mixed results on the association between cannabis use and opioid use as well as the impact of MOUD on cannabis use. The current study aims to investigate the effects of buprenorphine versus naltrexone on cannabis use outcomes in treatment seeking individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). METHODS: The current study was based on data from the CTN-0051 X:BOT trial, which compared the time to return to significant opioid use survival outcomes of two treatment seeking groups, one receiving Extended-Release Naltrexone (XR-naltrexone) (N = 283) versus another receiving Buprenorphine-Naloxone (N = 287) for OUD. A mixed-effects logistic regression model including treatment assignment (buprenorphine-naloxone vs XR-naltrexone), time, and a time by treatment interaction was run on the sample with the odds of cannabis use as the outcome, as well as two cross-lagged mediation models to explore the prospective mediation of cannabis use on opioid use outcomes (and opioid use on cannabis use outcomes) by treatment assignment during the trial. RESULTS: There was a significant effect of buprenorphine treatment on reduced cannabis use. Participants receiving buprenorphine treatment were 39 % less likely to use cannabis than those receiving naltrexone over all the timepoints (p = .0499). No significant mediation was found between treatment assignment and opioid use on cannabis use outcomes or between treatment assignment and cannabis use on opioid use outcomes in this trial.

Cannabis and cannabinoids that act through the endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system to help promote trauma recovery by means of enhanced extinction learning are potential therapeutic, pharmacological candidates. Using a preclinical model of translationally-relevant cannabis administration in rodents, we examined the impact of cannabis exposure on aversive memory. OBJECTIVES: Our study investigated the effects of acute cannabis exposure prior to (1) fear conditioning and (2) fear extinction, as well as (3) chronic cannabis exposure prior to fear conditioning, on the behavioural representations of fear memory dynamics in a Pavlovian auditory conditioning paradigm. METHODS: Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were acutely or chronically exposed to THC-dominant cannabis extract or vehicle vapor as described above. We then assessed both passive (freezing) and active (darting) fear behaviours during conditioning, extinction, retrieval, and spontaneous recovery. RESULTS: Acute cannabis exposure prior to conditioning had no immediate effects on fear acquisition, but impaired fear recall in females 24 h later and prevented spontaneous recovery of conditioned fear following a two-week retrieval test in both male and female rats. Acute cannabis exposure prior to extinction training impaired extinction in females while enhancing extinction acquisition in males. Finally, chronic THC exposure prior to fear conditioning initially potentiated fear responses, predominately in females, but produced no differences in spontaneous recovery in a two-week retrieval test. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis exposure has complex dynamics on fear memory, however, acute cannabis exposure prior to fear learning appears to result in destabilization of the fear memory long term, which could have potential implications for PTSD."

They were characterized by a battery of patient-reported outcomes stored electronically in the University of Pittsburgh Patient Outcomes Repository for Treatment (PORT). At 3 months, 38.6% were responders, based on clinically meaningful improvements in pain, function, or global impression of change, and maintained this response at 6 months. In the 157 patients who were coprescribed opioids, at 6 months there was a mean 39.3% decrease in morphine milligram equivalents (P < 0.05 for the difference vs baseline). In addition, 8114 patients treated in the same pain clinics with prescription pain medications instead (nonopioid or opioid) during the same timeframe were selected from PORT as a control group for comparison. They had a 34.9% rate of response at 3 months. Using the causal inference method of stratified modeling, logistic regression revealed an odds ratio of 2.6 in favor of medical marijuana vs medication treatment (P < 0.01). Potential harms data were not available in the PORT registry. Medical marijuana was comparatively more effective than prescription medications for the treatment of chronic pain at 3 months, although the populations compared were slightly different."

      "abstract": "Various practical strategies have been employed to mitigate the detrimental effects of water deficit stress on plants such as application of nano-stimulants. Nanosilicon plays a crucial role in alleviating the deleterious impacts of both abiotic and biotic stresses in plants by modulating various phyto-morphological and physiological processes. This study aimed to examine the combined effects of drought stress and nanosilicon application on the morphological traits and essential oil content and compositions of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), in which four-week-old seedlings were subjected to irrigation treatments at four levels, including 100% (control), 80% (mild stress), 60% (moderate stress) and 40% (severe stress) field capacity and nanosilicon at three concentrations (0, 0.5 and 1.5 mM) in a completely randomized factorial design experiment with three replications for 40 days. The results showed that the maximum plant height (109.07 cm), number of nodes (33.3), and number of flowering branches (29.4) were recorded under the treatment of 1.5 mM nanosilicon and 100% FC. The lowest fresh and dry weights of aerial parts were associated to the severe drought stress (40% FC) without nanosilicon application. The mild water stress (80% FC) combined with foliar application of 1.5 mM nanosilicon led to highest EO content (0.17%) compared with the other treatments. However, the highest content of cannabidiol in the essential oil was achieved in the severe water stress (40% FC) and treatment of 0.5 mM nanosilicon. The results showed that the application of nanosilicon improved the morphological characteristics and also changed the content and compositions of the hemp plants under drought stress conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies across multiple addictions have suggested that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) reduces cue-induced-craving (CIC), however there are no studies in treatment seeking participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD). In this secondary analysis of a previously completed trial, we explore whether a multi-session course of rTMS reduces CIC in CUD. METHODS: Seventy-one participants with ≥moderate CUD (age=30.2±9.9;37.5% female) were randomized to twenty sessions of active or sham rTMS applied to the left DLPFC (20-sessions, Beam-F3; 10Hz) in a two-site, double-blind, sham-controlled, phase-2 trial where they also received motivational enhancement therapy. Participants rated their craving for cannabis via the short-form of the marijuana craving questionnaire (MCQ-SF) before and after a neutral and cannabis-cue presentation. Participants underwent assessment before (immediate-pre), after (immediate-post), and two-, and four- weeks following the course of rTMS. RESULTS: The MCQ-SF scores increased following the presentation of cannabis cues relative to neutral cues at the immediate-pre timepoint in both treatment groups (p<0.0001). Following study treatment, the percent increase in MCQ-SF following cues diverged between the active and sham groups with significantly reduced CIC in the active group at the two-week post time-point (5.8±7.1% sham group, 0.91±4.1% active group; p=0.02). Between-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) were 0.24, 0.89, and 0.67 at the immediate-post, 2-week, and 4-week follow-up periods respectively. CONCLUSIONS: L-DLPFC applied rTMS may reduce CIC in treatment seeking participants with CUD."
