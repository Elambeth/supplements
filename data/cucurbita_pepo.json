      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of acid extraction, electron beam irradiation (EBI) extraction, ultrasound extraction, and combined EBI and ultrasound extraction on the yield, structure, and functional properties of pectin from spaghetti squash (Cucurbita pepo L. subsp. pepo) peel. The established extraction kinetics model indicated that the combined EBI and ultrasound extraction exhibited a synergistic effect, resulting in a pectin yield (13.50 %) higher than that obtained from acid extraction (6.55 %), EBI extraction (10.91 %), and ultrasound extraction (7.56 %). The pectin produced through the combined method (EUSP) demonstrated a low degree of esterification (DE) (34.77 %) and molecular weight (Mw) of 83 kDa. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed that EBI and ultrasound significantly disrupted the internal structure of the pectin. Rheological analysis indicated that the combined treatment reduced the viscosity characteristics of the pectin solution. EUSP exhibited good thermodynamic properties, emulsifying characteristics, antioxidant activities, and prebiotic activity. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the combined EBI and ultrasound extraction of pectin and offer insights for the efficient utilization of spaghetti squash peel and the application of pectin in the food industry."

      "abstract": "Cuprizone is a neurotoxin with copper-chelating ability, and it produces symptoms that are similar to those caused by multiple sclerosis lesions. Multiple sclerosis induced by cuprizone in animal models depicts oxidative stress as one of the prime factors in pathogenesis. Neurodegeneration has become an extremely serious issue on a global scale. It is preferable to use natural therapy to stop the disease's progression and future occurrences. Cucurbita pepo is a plant with neuroprotective properties and antioxidant properties. The purpose of this study was to determine the ameliorative capability of C. pepo in cuprizone-induced behavioral parameters and histopathological alterations in Wistar rats. The study included four groups of rats: a control group (normal saline), a cuprizone-induced group, and two treatment groups receiving C. pepo at low (200 mg/kg) and high (400 mg/kg) doses for 5 weeks. We exposed the rats to a rotarod test, a forced swimming test, and an elevated plus maze test to assess their behavioral parameters, including motor coordination and anxiety level. Following the study, animals were sacrificed, and brain tissues were extracted to resolve biochemical analysis for oxidative stress along with histopathological changes to determine and compare the oxidative stress between the inducer and treated group and also to analyze the remyelination ability of C. pepo in the disease-induced rat. Results revealed that the rats treated with C. pepo demonstrated significant improvements in motor coordination (P < 0.001) and reduced anxiety-like behavior (P < 0.01) and oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. Histopathological analysis showed reduced demyelination and enhanced neuronal integrity in treated groups. These findings indicate that C. pepo attenuates cuprizone-induced oxidative stress and demyelination, supporting its neuroprotective potential in multiple sclerosis models."

      "abstract": "Acrylamide (ACR) is a hazardous chemical pollutant due to thermal processing of certain foods. This study aimed to profile the metabolites of the methanolic extract of Cucurbita pepo L. (Cucurbitaceae) aerial parts against nephrotoxicity induced by ACR in rats. GC/MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis were used for isolation and differentiation of different metabolites. In silico study was done on the identified triterpenes and sterols. In vivo nephrotoxicity was done by intraperitoneal injection of ACR to rats. Serum kidney function tests, oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and histopathological observation were evaluated. Twenty-four compounds were identified, where stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were the most prevalent metabolites. Fifty-one compounds in positive and negative modes were also identified. Four compounds were isolated: stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, p-coumaric, and p-hydroxybenzoic. Cucurbitacin A 2-O-β-d-glucopyranoside and karaviloside XIII possessed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by in silico study. Treatment with C. pepo L. aerial parts methanolic extract restored the levels of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH). In conclusion, C. pepo L. leaves methanolic extract possessed curative effect against ACR toxicity due to its richness with different bioactive compounds."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the combined effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (Nano-Zn) and moringa leaf extract (MLE) on squash plants grown under water stress conditions in saline soil during 2021-2022. The research compared full irrigation (100% ETc) with water deficit conditions (60% ETc). While water deficit negatively impacted plant growth, yield, and various physiological parameters, the sequential application of Nano-Zn (at 50 or 100 mg L-1) with MLE (3%) significantly mitigated these adverse effects. The combined treatment proved more effective than individual applications, enhancing growth parameters, photosynthetic efficiency, and antioxidant systems. The treatment particularly improved stress tolerance by increasing protective compounds like soluble sugars and amino acids while reducing harmful H2O2 levels. The study concluded that sequential application of 100 mg L-1 Nano-Zn with MLE was optimal for enhancing squash performance under drought stress, with 50 mg L-1 Nano-Zn plus MLE as the second-best option."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic telogen effluvium (TE) and androgenetic alopecia represent two prevalent forms of hair loss that can significantly impact individuals' quality of life. Insufficiency of essential micronutrients has been associated with hair loss. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an oral supplement containing l-Cystine, Serenoa repens, Cucurbita pepo, Pygeum africanum, vitamins, and micronutrients in chronic TE (CTE) and androgenetic alopecia (AGA). METHODS: Eighty patients of both sexes aged 18-60 years with CTE or AGA were randomized to receive one capsule daily of the oral supplement or placebo for 6 months. Dermatological evaluations, clinical pictures and phototrichograms were done at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The overall hair volume and appearance were assessed before and after treatment as well as subject's self-assessment via standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Hair density increased by 9.9 hairs/cm2 after 3 months and 12.3 hairs/cm2 after 6 months in the oral supplement group and it is statistically significant when compared to placebo. Overall hair volume after 1, 3, and 6 months is better in the supplement group than in the placebo group. The oral supplement was well tolerated. No moderate or severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation can increase hair density, anagen hairs, and overall hair appearance in patients with AGA or CTE."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment (US; 25 kHz; 5 min) and the lactic acid bacteria strain (LAB; Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG) on the quality of fermented pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.). The pumpkin was inoculated with 5 log CFU/g of specific LAB strain. Fermentation was carried out for 7 days at 35 °C. Some samples were US treated at the washing stage. During fermentation, there was an increase in the LAB count of 3 logarithmic cycles compared to the initial inoculum. For L. rhamnosus, preceding fermentation by US treatment contributed to an increased bacteria count of 4 logarithmic cycles. In the case of fermentation with L. rhamnosus, the lactic acid content was significantly higher than for L. plantarum. These samples are also characterized by higher sensory properties, desirability of taste, and overall desirability. Fermentation contributed to a decrease in carotenoid and phenolic compounds content and an increase in the antioxidant capacity of the pumpkins, regardless of the bacterial strain.",

      "abstract": "Members of the Cucurbitaceae family accumulate several hydrophobic organic pollutants in their above-ground parts at high concentrations. Major latex-like proteins (MLPs) identified in Cucurbita pepo bind to hydrophobic organic pollutants, such as pyrene and dieldrin, in roots, forming complexes that are transported via xylem vessels to the above-ground plant parts. However, soil remediation of hydrophobic organic pollutants utilizing MLPs has not been established. In this study, the uptake of the hydrophobic organic pollutant pyrene by C. pepo was promoted through the upregulation of the expression of MLP genes following agrochemical treatment. Probenazole, an active ingredient in the agrochemical Oryzemate, was previously found to upregulate the promoter activity of MLP genes in the roots of transgenic tobacco plants. Here, Oryzemate treatment increased the levels of MLPs in the roots and xylem sap of C. pepo. Oryzemate treatment slightly increased and significantly decreased the pyrene concentration in the xylem sap of C. pepo cultivated in high- and low-contamination soils, respectively. Probenazole competitively inhibited the binding of MLPs to pyrene in vitro, thereby likely suppressing its uptake by C. pepo in low-contamination soil. This study demonstrated that Oryzemate possesses dual effects: effective phytoremediation and safe crop production, depending on the soil contamination level.",

Methods: Fifty-six albino rats were divided into seven groups of eight rats each after a 2-week acclimatization period. All animals had unrestricted access to water and feed, and treatments were administered orally once daily for 42 days. Glutamate dehydrogenase and glutaminase activities were assessed using brain homogenate, while lipid profiles were analyzed in serum samples. Results: Tramadol toxicity was evidenced by significant (P < 0.05) increases in brain glutamate dehydrogenase along with significant (P < 0.05) decreases in the activities of glutaminase in the group administered only tramadol. Also, serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides also increased significantly (P < 0.05) following administration of tramadol with decreased level of HDL-C (P < 0.05). However, treatment with CPSO significantly restored the activities and levels of the altered biochemical parameters in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the biochemical investigation using the lipid profile and the enzymes of glutamate metabolism were corroborated by the results obtained from the histopathological examination of the brain. Conclusion: The results of this study therefore suggest that tramadol-induced dyslipidemia and neuronal dysfunction be managed and prevented by the administration of Cucurbita pepo seed oil."

The latter can have irreversible effects on ecosystems, including species extinction, trophic chain contamination and altered human health, particularly in the case of consumed plants such as zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.). This study aims to investigate the effects of nickel on various physiological and biochemical parameters of zucchini growth, with a particular focus on how this toxic metal impacts the quality of fruit that is consumed by humans. To achieve this, plants aged 45 days were grown for one month on solid media loaded with different concentrations of Ni (0, 100, 300 and 500 µM). The results showed that exposure of plants to Ni resulted in significantly altered growth and higher accumulation of Ni in the shoots (1314 µg·g-1 DW) than in roots and fruits. Concerning non-enzymatic antioxidants, the results showed that Ni toxicity significantly increased total polyphenols, especially in shoots at 300 µM Ni, while flavonoid content decreased in the roots and shoots in response to Ni treatment. Our results also show that nickel tolerance in C. pepo is ensured by a combination of several mechanisms such as an increase in the content of proline. This species can survive and tolerate, to different degrees, toxic cations at concentrations up to 500 µM but with visible symptoms of toxicity such as chlorosis of the leaves. Indeed, based on thresholds of hyperaccumulation, we can qualify Cucurbita pepo as a hyperaccumulator species of nickel."

Antimicrobial and anticancer activities were also studied by disc diffusion assays and in vivo and in vitro methods. The molecular weight of CPL was 30 ± 1 KDa and it was stable at different pH (5.0 to 9.0) and temperatures (30 to 60 °C). CPL recovered its hemagglutination activity in the presence of Ca2+. 4-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside, lactose, rhamnose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine strongly inhibited the activity. With an LC50 value of 265 µg/mL, CPL was moderately toxic and exhibited bacteriostatic, bactericidal and antibiofilm activities against different pathogenic bacteria. It also exhibited marked antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and agglutinated A. flavus spores. In vivo antiproliferative activity against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells in Swiss albino mice was observed when CPL exerted 36.44% and 66.66% growth inhibition at doses of 3.0 mg/kg/day and 6.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. A 12-day treatment by CPL could reverse their RBC and WBC counts as well as restore the hemoglobin percentage to normal levels. The MTT assay of CPL performed against human breast (MCF-7) and lung (A-549) cancer cell lines showed 29.53% and 18.30% of inhibitory activity at concentrations of 128 and 256 µg/mL, respectively.",

In this work, we conducted a genome-wide study of the components of these families in Cucurbita pepo. RESULTS: The bioinformatic analysis of the C. pepo genome resulted in the identification of 19 CpPYL, 102 CpPP2C and 10 CpSnRK2 genes. The investigation of gene structure and protein motifs allowed to define 4 PYL, 13 PP2C and 3 SnRK2 subfamilies. RNA-seq analysis was used to determine the expression of these gene families in different plant organs, as well as to detect their differential gene expression during germination, and in response to ABA and cold stress in leaves. The specific tissue expression of some gene members indicated the relevant role of some ABA signalling genes in plant development. Moreover, their differential expression under ABA treatment or cold stress revealed those ABA signalling genes that responded to ABA, and those that were up- or down-regulated in response to cold stress. A reduced number of genes responded to both treatments. Specific PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 genes that had potential roles in germination were also detected, including those regulated early during the imbibition phase, those regulated later during the embryo extension and radicle emergence phase, and those induced or repressed during the whole germination process. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this research open new research lines for agriculture and for assessing gene function in future studies.",

However, genome-wide identification and responses to abiotic and pathogen stresses of the ARF gene family in Cucurbita pepo L, especially pathogen stresses, have not been reported. RESULTS: Finally, 33 ARF genes (CpARF01 to CpARF33) were identified in C.pepo from the Cucurbitaceae genome database using bioinformatics methods. The putative protein contains 438 to 1071 amino acids, the isoelectric point is 4.99 to 8.54, and the molecular weight is 47759.36 to 117813.27 Da, the instability index ranged from 40.74 to 68.94, and the liposoluble index ranged from 62.56 to 76.18. The 33 genes were mainly localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and distributed on 16 chromosomes unevenly. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 33 CpARF proteins were divided into 6 groups. According to the amino acid sequence of CpARF proteins, 10 motifs were identified, and 1,3,6,8,10 motifs were highly conserved in most of the CpARF proteins. At the same time, it was found that genes in the same subfamily have similar gene structures. Cis-elements and protein interaction networks predicted that CpARF may be involved in abiotic factors related to the stress response. QRT-PCR analysis showed that most of the CpARF genes were upregulated under NaCl, PEG, and pathogen treatment compared to the control. Subcellular localization showed that CpARF22 was localized in the nucleus. The transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines with the CpARF22 gene enhanced their tolerance to salt and drought stress. CONCLUSION: In this study, we systematically analyzed the CpARF gene family and its expression patterns under drought, salt, and pathogen stress, which improved our understanding of the ARF protein of zucchini, and laid a solid foundation for functional analysis of the CpARF gene.",

AIM OF THE STUDY: Considering the medicinal value of pumpkin seed oil, its availability, and neglected use, it becomes necessary to evaluate the possible potential of the seed oil in tramadol-induced oxidative stress in Wister Albino rats. METHODS OF THE STUDY: This study used fifty-six (56) albino rats to determine the impact of Cucurbita pepo seed oil (CPSO) on tramadol-induced oxidative stress. The rats were grouped into 7. After a week of acclimatization, rats in group 1 (normal control) had access to water and food, while rats in group 2 received 5 mL/Kg (b.w) of normal saline. 100 mg/kg of tramadol (TM) was delivered to groups 3-6 to induce toxicity. The third group (TM control) received no treatment, whilst the other 3 groups (TM-CPSO treatment groups) received 5, 2.5, and 1.5 mL/Kg of CPSO, respectively. Group 7 received only 5 mL/kg CPSO (CPSO group). Similarly, groups 2 through 7 had unrestricted access to food and water for 42 days and received treatments via oral intubation once per day. Indicators of oxidative stress were discovered in the brain homogenate. RESULTS: TM toxicity was demonstrated by a considerable increase (P < .05) in the brain MDA level and a significant drop (P < .05) in the brain GSH level, as well as a significant reduction (P < .05) in GPx, catalase, SOD, GST, and quinone reductase activities. CONCLUSION: The dose-dependent delivery of CPSO was able to restore not only the activity but also the concentrations of the altered markers."

Besides, the development of resistance, traditional therapy has numerous antagonistic effects. Thereby, finding efficient natural alternatives is required. In comparison to albendazole, this study evaluated the impact of pumpkin decoction on Trichinella spiralis in experimentally infected mice. The anthelmintic action of pumpkin decoction (500 mg/kg) was determined using T. spiralis infected mice in enteric phase for 5 days. Pumpkin decoction anthelmintic activity fortified by mixing with honey (1:1). Pumpkin decoction and Pumpkin decoction-honey mixture were evaluated by comprising with reference drug, albendazole (50 mg/kg). The T. spiralis adult count was significantly lower in all treated groups, with the pumpkin decoction-honey mixture showing the largest reduction (83.2%) when compared to the infected group (P ≤ 0.001). The intestinal histological changes and the level of COX-2 expression in the intestinal tissue were both significantly reduced in the same group. The pumpkin decoction improved the immune response, as evidenced by a significant decrease in nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and a significant increase in the expression of the transforming growth factor (TGF-1β) and interleukin-17 (IL-17). The pumpkin decoction's anthelmintic action was facilitated by the TGF-1β and IL-17-driven Weep and Sweep mechanism. Both administration of pumpkin decoction beside honey showed the best treatment group that resulted in high infection reduction besides amelioration of biochemical markers and restoration of histological to normal state. In conclusion, pumpkin decoction is highly effective against T. spiralis which could be a promising alternative herbal drug and the pumpkin decoction effect was higher in the case of combination with honey.",

This work aimed to study the therapeutic effect of clorsulon (sulphoamide) and aqueous extract of Cucurbita pepo in the treatment of experimental heterophyiasis. Mice were infected with encysted metacercaiae of Heterophyes heterophyes obtained from infected fish flesh. Mice were divided into five groups according to the drug used. The treatment started two weeks post-infection. Our results showed reduction of the recovered worm count with high efficacy of clorsulon and a moderate effect of C. pepo which was increased in the second week with much improvement of the intestinal histopathological changes. Scanning electron microscopy of adult H. heterophyes obtained from the intestine of mice treated with praziquantel appeared contracted with multiple small vesicles over the dorsal surface. Clorsulon produced loss of the spines on the lateral sides of the parasite with few vesicles whereas C. pepo seeds showed complete loss of the spines. In conclusion, clorsulon has high efficacy against H. heterophyes infection. Although the extract of C. pepo showed moderate curative effect against this parasite, it can be used in combination with other agents for a better synergistic effect."

The aim of current study was to investigate the potential of C. pepo in attenuation of diabetic neuropathy via using streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model in male wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetic neuropathy was induced by administration of STZ; 65 mg/kg, i.p. and Nicotinamide (NAD; 230 mg/kg i.p.) and assessed by measuring thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) in experimental animals. Treatment with different doses of (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) petroleum ether extract of C. pepo (CPE) and hydroethanolic extract of C. pepo (CHE) was started from the 60th day of STZ/NAD administration and continued upto 90th day. RESULTS: CPE and CHE significantly attenuated the behavioural changes including hyperalgesia, allodynia and MNCV linked to diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, the oxidative stress and level of TNF-α, TGF-β and IL-1β was found to be significantly attenuated in experimental animals. CONCLUSION: Thus C. pepo might ameliorate the progression of diabetic neuropathy via modulation of chronic hyperglycemia and therefore and have therapeutic potential for treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain.",

      "abstract": "Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) is one of the main vegetable crops grown under protected cultivation in northern China. Low-temperature (LT) stress severely inhibits the growth of zucchini seedlings, resulting in reductions in yield and quality. Here, using three kinds of different humic acids, including coal-based humic acid (CHA), fulvic acid (FA), and biochemical humic acid (BHA), we investigated the effects of humic acids against LT stress (5 °C) in zucchini seedlings. Treatment with all three kinds of humic acids improves LT stress tolerance by decreasing oxidative damage through increases in antioxidative enzyme activities and the contents of soluble sugar and proline in zucchini seedlings, especially after BHA application. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that a total of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were commonly induced in the leaves of FA-, CHA-, and BHA-treated zucchini seedlings under LT stress, including calmodulin, ethylene-responsive transcription factors (TFs), peroxidases, and 10 TFs, including two NAC and seven WRKY genes. Altogether, these results indicated that supplementation with humic acids reprograms plant metabolism and modulates the expression of genes involved in ROS scavenging, phytohormone metabolism, or signaling pathways, finally improving LT stress tolerance in zucchini seedlings."

      "abstract": "The enhanced salt tolerance of squash ethylene-insensitive mutants during germination and early stages of seedling development suggested that abscisic acid (ABA) could mediate this tolerance. To gain insight into the crosstalk between ethylene and ABA in seed germination, the germination rate and early seedling growth of wild type (WT) and ethylene-insensitive etr2b mutant were compared in seeds germinated under water and exogenous ABA treatment. The etr2b seeds germinated earlier than WT under both water and ABA, and the effect of ABA on radicle length and seedling growth of etr2b was lower than in WT, indicating that etr2b is also insensitive to ABA. The comparison of ABA and ethylene contents and ABA and ethylene gene expression profiles in WT and etr2b dry and imbibed seeds in either water, NaCl or ABA demonstrated a clear crosstalk between ethylene and ABA in germination. The expression profiles of ethylene genes in WT and etr2b indicated that the role of ethylene in seed germination does not appear to follow the canonical ethylene signaling pathway. Instead, etr2b reduces ABA content during formation of the seeds (dry seeds) and in response to seed imbibition and germination, which means diminished dormancy in the ethylene mutant. The etr2b mutation downregulated the expression of ABA biosynthesis and signaling genes during germination, demonstrating the positive role of ethylene receptor gene CpETR2B on seed germination and early seedling growth in squash is mediated by ABA. The reduced effect of exogenous ABA on ethylene production and ethylene gene expression in etr2b seeds suggests that this regulation is also dependent on ethylene.",

Supercritical CO2 technology has been employed as a highly selective \"green\" methodology allowing the recovery of compounds without chemical degradation and limited operational costs. Free fatty acids have been collected in mild conditions while an enrichment in sterols has been selectively obtained from sc-CO2 extracts by appropriate modulation of process parameters (supercritical fluid pressure and temperature), hence demonstrating the feasibility of the technique to target added-value compounds in a selective way. Obtained fatty acids were thus converted into the corresponding ethanol carboxamide derivatives by lipase-mediated biocatalyzed reactions, while the hydroxylated derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids were obtained by stereoselective hydration reaction under reductive conditions in the presence of a selected FADH2-dependent oleate hydratase.",

This study evaluated the antiplasmodial potential of selected plants used to treat malaria in Nsukka, Enugu state, Nigeria. Leaves of three different plants (Cucurbita pepo, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Pennisetum purpureum) were collected for screening and two extracts viz., 70%v/v ethanol and dichloromethane/methanol (1:1 v/v), were prepared for each. An acute toxicity test was done in mice and cytotoxicity was assessed using human hepatoma cell line (HUH). The extracts were screened against chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum (Pf3D7) in vitro, and chloroquine-resistant P. berghei ANKA in vivo using a 4 day-suppressive test in mice. Cucurbita pepo ethanol extract was further tested for hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes and in established infection in mice. Parameters assessed were post-treatment parasitemia, hematological indices, organ (brain, kidney, liver, and spleen) weights, and survival. The extracts were non-cytotoxic up to a test dose of 100 μg/ml and 2000 mg/kg fed - mice did not show acute or delayed toxicity. Cucurbita pepo ethanol extract (CpE) displayed excellent in vitro antiplasmodial activity with IC50 of 3.05 μg/ml. At an oral dose of 500 mg/kg, mice were observed to display significant (p < 0.01) ∼51% suppression of parasitemia. The extract did not produce any significant hemolytic effect up to a test concentration of 1 mg/ml. In established infection, a dose of 300 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.01) protected mice from anemia caused by low hematocrit. The extract produced significant (p < 0.05) elevation in red blood cells and platelet counts, and an increase in hemoglobin was evident at 100 and 300 mg/kg. Further, CpE in a dose-dependent manner, reversed liver and spleen weight increase seen in untreated, infected mice. These findings show C. pepo as a potential candidate for further studies to identify its bioactive principle(s) and possible mechanism(s) of antimalarial action."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The link between psychological stress and skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis is established. Pumpkin was proved to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and accelerating wound healing potential. AIM: To assess the efficacy of pumpkin fruit (Cucurbita pepo L.) extract (PE) in relieving contact dermatitis (CD) in depressed rats compared to a standard treatment of CD and explore the mechanism behind this effect. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty male albino rats were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 4 weeks for induction of depression, then exposed to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) for 2 weeks for induction of CD. The rats were then divided into 3 groups (n = 10 each); the positive control, Betamethasone-treated, and PE-treated groups. Depression was confirmed by the forced swim test and measuring the serum corticosterone level. Proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were measured in the skin and serum and their mRNA levels were assessed using qRT-PCR. Oxidant/antioxidant profile including levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) was assessed in the skin and serum. Histopathological assessment of skin samples was performed and CD4 and CD68 immunoexpression was assessed. RESULTS: The used PE included a large amount of oleic acid (about 56%) and a small amount of linoleic acid (about 1%). The topical application of PE significantly attenuated inflammation and oxidative changes attributed to CD associated with chronic stress-induced depression comparable to the standard treatment of CD. PE significantly alleviated signs and histopathological score of CD (p < 0.001) through the significant down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the significant up-regulation of antioxidants in the skin. Significant down-regulation (p < 0.001) of TNF-α, IL-6, COX-2 and iNOS gene expression in the PE-treated group confirmed the anti-inflammatory action of PE. CONCLUSIONS: The pumpkin extract, applied topically in CD associated with depression, could be an alternative as well as preventive approach in treating CD. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidants activity of pumpkin is a proposed mechanism behind this effect. Further studies to test this effect on volunteer patients of CD are recommended."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the symptoms, quality of life and sexual well-being in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia LUTS/BPH treated with pumpkin seed soft extract (PSE) in routine practice. METHODS: This noninterventional study included 130 men treated for up to 24 months. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and related quality of life, Aging Males' Symptoms Scale (AMS), and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) were recorded. Descriptive statistical methods were applied. The mean with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the primary end point (change in IPSS after 12-month treatment). RESULTS: Analysis at 12 months included 83 patients [mean (SD) age 65.2 (8.7) years and IPSS (15.6 (3.4), IPSS-QoL 3.4 (0.9)]. AMS and IIEF-5 indicated mild or mild to moderate disorder regarding sexual well-being and erectile dysfunction, respectively. After 12 months, the mean IPSS change from baseline was - 4.7 (95% CI - 5.4 to - 3.9), with 83% (95% CI 65.3 to 84.1) and 53% (95% CI 42.3 to 63.7) of the patients achieving reductions by at least 3 and 5 points, respectively. The proportion of patients with IPSS-QoL below 3 points (mostly satisfied) was 11% (9/83) at baseline and rose to 62% (51/83) and 73% (40/55) at 12 and 24 months, respectively. AMS and IIEF-5 scores did not indicate a negative impact on sexual function during treatment. CONCLUSION: In men with a moderate LUTS suggestive of BPH, a low progression risk and an active sex life, treatment with pumpkin seed soft extract provided symptomatic relief, improved IPSS-QoL, and maintained sexual well-being.

      "abstract": "In the last decades, the interest in biological activity of natural compounds has been growing. In plant protection, essential oils have been reported to exhibit antiviral, antimycotic, and antiparasitic activities, and are regarded as promising for the formulation of safe antimicrobial agents. Attention has also been focused on hydrosols, the by-products of hydro-distillation of essential oils. Their production is easy, fast, and cheap, and they seem to arise less concern for human health than essential oils. Plant viruses represent a major concern for agricultural crops since no treatment compound is available for virus control. This work was aimed at evaluating the antiphytoviral effectiveness of treatments with three essential oils and corresponding hydrosols extracted from Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris, and Rosmarinus officinalis on Cucurbita pepo plants infected by zucchini yellow mosaic virus or tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus. Treatments were applied either concurrently or after virus inoculation to ascertain an inhibition or curative activity, respectively. Symptoms were observed and samplings were performed weekly. Virus titer and expression levels of phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene (PAL) were measured on treated and untreated infected plants by real-time PCR. PAL gene plays an important role in plant defense response as it is involved in tolerance/resistance to phytopathogens. Results indicated that treatments were effective against tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus whether applied simultaneously with the inoculation or after. A major inhibition was observed with O. vulgare essential oil and hydrosol, resulting in 10-4-fold decrease of virus titer 3 weeks after treatment. Curative activity gave maximum results with all three essential oils and T. vulgaris and R. officinalis hydrosols, recording from 10-2-fold decrease to virus not detected 4 weeks after treatment. An induction of PAL gene expression was recorded at 12 d.p.i. and then was restored to the levels of untreated control. This allows to hypothesize an early plant defense response to virus infection, possibly boosted by treatments. Plant extracts' composition was characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Phenols were largely main components of O. vulgare and T. vulgaris extracts (carvacrol and thymol, respectively), while extracts from R. officinalis were based on monoterpene hydrocarbons (essential oil) and oxygenated monoterpenes (hydrosol)."

Twenty four male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups and fed a 20% casein diet, 20% casein diet supplemented with pumpkin protein, 20% casein diet with 64% D-fructose, or 20% casein diet with pumpkin protein and 64% D-fructose for 8 weeks. Contin-uous fructose feeding induced an increase in plasma insulin/glucose ratio, BP, insulin and glucose, aspartate aminotrans-ferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, urea, and uric acid levels, and a decrease in the liver and muscle glycogen stores. In addition, elevated levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and leptin and lowered adiponectin levels were observed in rats fed a fructose-enriched diet. These groups also exhibited lower plasma levels of ascorbic acid and glutathione, higher thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, hydroperoxide, carbonyl, and nitric oxide in both the liver and kidneys than rats fed the control diet. Interestingly, pumpkin seed protein treatment significantly counteracted alterations induced by fructose improving glucose, insulin, BP, TG, TC, ALT, and ALP levels, increasing liver and muscle glycogen stores, adiponectin level, and adiponectin/leptin ratio, and reducing plasma leptin lev-els. In addition, rats fed pumpkin protein with a high-fructose diet improved oxidative stress in the liver and kidneys. In conclusion, proteins from Cucurbita pepo L. seeds effectively improve metabolic parameters and protect against oxidative stress induced by a high-fructose diet."

      "abstract": "The squash bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer), is a serious pest of cucurbit crops across the United States, especially within summer squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) systems. Using their piercing sucking mouthparts, squash bugs feed on both leaf tissue and fruits, often leading to leaf necrosis, marketable fruit loss, and even plant death. To date, the relationship between squash bug presence and plasticulture has not been adequately investigated. This 2-yr study evaluated the effects of white, black, and reflective plastic mulch colors on the occurrence of all squash bug life stages and marketable zucchini yield in Virginia. In both years, A. tristis adults and egg masses were more numerous on zucchini plants grown in white and reflective plastic mulch compared to bare ground plants. Greater nymphal densities and marketable fruit yield were observed in certain plastic mulch treatments versus the bare ground treatment, yet these differences were not consistent in both years. Contrary to the repellency effects reflective mulches have on other cucurbit insect pests, our research suggests that reflective and other plastic mulch colors can negatively impact squash bug management, especially in regions with high A. tristis pressure. Our study offers new insights for cucurbit growers to use when considering whether they should implement plasticulture in their growing systems.",

The experiment aimed the development of dysphagia-oriented food products, which need to meet special requirements as a challenge for food rheology and novel ready-to-eat products. The pectin was added in the range of 0.1-0.3%. The courgette puree was ohmically heated at 20 V/cm for 3 min. The ohmic heating was used to improve and preserve the main properties of the purees. The antioxidant activity is stimulated by the ohmic heating, the values ranging up to 58% compared with the control sample. The courgette purees with apple or citrus pectin has registered a pseudoplastic rheological behaviour. The hardness increases with 22% once with the application of the thermic treatment. FT-IR spectroscopy and confocal microscopy reveal the benefits of using the ohmic heating as a processing method for courgettes puree. The results demonstrated the importance of using ohmic heating in the obtaining of courgettes puree for people with dysphagia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is very common in aging men. We aimed to compare the effects of tamsulosin and pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) seed oil on BPH symptoms. METHODS: This single-blind randomized clinical trial included patients with BPH aged ≥ 50 years referred to the Urology Clinic of Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Hamadan, Iran, from August 23, 2019 to February 19, 2020. Patients were randomized into two groups. One group received 0.4 mg tamsulosin every night at bedtime and the other received 360 mg pumpkin seed oil twice a day. Patients' age, weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was filled out by the patients at baseline and then 1 month and 3 months after the initiation of treatment. The BPH-associated quality of life (QoL), serum prostate-specific antigen, prostate and postvoid residual volume, and maximum urine flow were also assessed at baseline and 3 months later. Drug side effects were also noted. RESULTS: Of the 73 patients included in this study with a mean age of 63.59 ± 7.04 years, 34 were in the tamsulosin group and 39 in the pupkin seed oil group. Patients were comparable with respect to age, weight, height, BMI, and baseline principal variables in both groups. Also, there was no significant difference between groups in terms of principal variables at any time point. However, there was a significant decrease in IPSS and a significant improvement in QoL in both groups. Although the decrease in IPSS from baseline to 1 month and 3 months was significantly higher in the tamsulosin group compared to the pumpkin group (P = 0.048 and P = 0.020, respectively), the decrease in IPSS from 1 to 3 months was similar (P = 0.728). None of the patients in the pumpkin group experienced drug side effects, while dizziness (5.9%), headache (2.9%), retrograde ejaculation (2.9%), and erythema with pruritus occurred in the tamsulosin group. CONCLUSIONS: Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) seed oil relieved BPH symptoms with no side effects, but was not as effective as tamsulosin. Further studies are required to confirm the role of pumpkin seed oil as an option for the treatment of BPH symptoms. Trial registration Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, IRCT20120215009014N340.

      "abstract": "Pumpkin has received significant attention due to its nutritional compounds that have antioxidant, antifatigue, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study is aimed at assessing the antidepressant-like effect of L. Cucurbita pepo, sweet pumpkin, in an animal model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and investigating its effect on the histological structure of hippocampus compared to fluoxetine. Forty male albino rats assigned into the negative control, positive control (CUMS), and Flu-treated and pumpkin-treated groups (n = 10) were utilized in this study. Exposing rats to CUMS continued for 28 days, and treatments used were applied during the last 14 days of exposure. Behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological changes were assessed after 28 days. In this study, pumpkin significantly reduced the immobility time (p = 0.02), corticosterone (p < 0.001), TNF-α, IL-6 (p < 0.001), and malondialdehyde (p = 0.003), whereas it significantly increased the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in the serum of rats exposed to CUMS. Pumpkin markedly relieved the degenerative and atrophic changes observed in the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. It significantly reduced caspase-3 and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoexpression in the CA3 and DG. In conclusion, administration of pumpkin extract improved the behavioral, biochemical, and hippocampal pathological alternations induced in rats after exposure to CUMS in a comparable pattern to fluoxetine. This study highlighted the potential efficacy of pumpkin in alleviating depression disorder either alone or in conjugation with conventional antidepressant therapy.",

The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidepressant activities of pumpkin were previously reported. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combined topical and oral application of pumpkin fruit (Cucurbita pepo L.) extract (PE) in relieving CD associated with chronic stress-induced depression and compare it to the topical pumpkin extract alone and to the standard treatment. Materials and Methods: Forty male albino rats were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 4 weeks for induction of depression and then exposed to (1-fluoro-2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene, DNFB) for 2 weeks for induction of CD. Those rats were assigned into 4 groups (n = 10 each); untreated, betamethasone-treated, PE-treated and pumpkin extract cream, and oral-treated groups. Treatments were continued for 2 weeks. All groups were compared to the negative control group (n = 10). Depression was behaviorally and biochemically confirmed. Serum and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, COX-2, and iNOS, were assessed. Oxidant/antioxidant profile was assessed in the serum and skin. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assessments of affected skin samples were performed. Results: Pumpkin extract, used in this study, included a large amount of oleic acid (about 56%). The combined topical and oral administration of PE significantly reduced inflammatory and oxidative changes induced by CD and depression compared to the CD standard treatment and to the topical PE alone. PE significantly alleviated CD signs and the histopathological score (p < 0.001) mostly through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the upregulation of antioxidants. Conclusion: Pumpkin extract, applied topically and orally, could be an alternative and/or complementary approach for treating contact dermatitis associated with depression. Further studies on volunteer patients of contact dermatitis are recommended."

Data showed the pivotal role of tocopherol in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The current study was designed to probe into the antiparkinson activity of methanolic extract of C. pepo (MECP) seeds in the haloperidol-induced Parkinson rat model. Behavioral studies showed improvement in motor functions. The increase in catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione levels whereas the decreases in the malondialdehyde and nitrite levels were noted in a dose-dependent manner. Acetylcholine-esterase (AchE) activity was increased. Molecular docking results revealed significant binding interaction of selected phytoconstituents within an active site of target protein AchE (PDB ID: 4EY7). Furthermore, α-synuclein was up regulated with down regulation of TNF-α and IL-1β in the qRT-PCR study. Subsequently, ADMET results on the basis of structure to activity predictions in terms of pharmacokinetics and toxicity estimations show that selected phytochemicals exhibited moderately acceptable properties. These properties add knowledge towards the structural features which could improve the bioavailability of selected phytochemicals before moving towards the initial phase of the drug development. Our integrated drug discovery scheme concluded that C. pepo seeds could ameliorate symptoms of PD and may prove a lead remedy for the treatment of PD.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of diet supplemented with raw and roasted pumpkin seeds on some key biochemical parameters relevant to erectile function in corpus cavernosal tissues of male rats. Rats were fed with basal diets (NC), diet supplemented with raw (5% and 10%) and roasted (5% and 10%) pumpkin seeds for the evaluation of adenosine deaminase (ADA), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), arginase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, including nitric oxide level and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Diet supplemented with roasted pumpkin seeds showed better PDE-5, ADA, arginase activities, as well as NO and MDA levels. No significant difference was observed in AChE activities of rats treated with raw and roasted pumpkin seeds. The modulatory effects of raw and roasted pumpkin seeds on enzymes associated with erectile dysfunction suggest the biochemical rationale for its therapeutic role in enhancing erectile function. However, roasted pumpkin seeds (10%, w/w of diet) possess more beneficial effects than the raw seeds. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Pumpkin is a nutritious vegetable used in folklore for the treatment of bladder, prostate, and kidney diseases. The seeds are known to contain phenolic compounds which exert different health benefits. Processing of foods has been shown to either improve the quality or reduce the bioactive components which affect its functionality. In this study, roasting improved the biochemical parameters associated with erectile function in male rats. Roasted pumpkin seeds also reduced the oxidative stress parameters in rats' penile tissues when compared to raw pumpkin seeds. This study revealed that thermal processing associated with roasting could improve the antioxidant activity of pumpkin seeds and crucial enzymes related to erectile function. Hence, consumption of roasted pumpkin seeds could be more beneficial compared to raw pumpkin seeds.",

      "abstract": "Viruses transmitted by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) cause severe damage to cucurbits in the southern United States. In the fall of 2020, samples of squash plants (Cucurbita pepo) exhibiting symptoms of yellow mottle, interveinal yellowing, and leaf crumple were collected from an insecticide trial in Tifton, Georgia. Total nucleic acid was isolated using the MagMAX 96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions but without DNase treatment. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR were carried out to determine the presence of whitefly-transmitted viruses. We identified infection by cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) using primers targeting a 953 nt segment of CCYV RNA1 encoding the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) (CCYV-RDRP-1515F-5'CTCCGAGTAGATCATCCCAAATC3' and CCYV-RDRP-1515R-5'TCACCAGAAACTCCACAATCTC 3') along with other whitefly-transmitted viruses previously reported in Georgia. CCYV was detected from 27 of the 28 samples tested, while cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV; Polston et al., 2008) and cucurbit leaf crumple virus (CuLCrV; Gadhave et al., 2020) were detected from 23 and 28 squash samples, respectively, with all three viruses regularly occurring as mixed infections. The presence of CCYV was further confirmed by amplification of portions of two different genomic segments from RNA2, including a section of the heat-shock protein (HSP) homolog gene (Bananej et al. 2013) as well as a portion of the coat protein (CP) gene which was amplified using primers CCYV_CPF-5'TCCCGGTGCCAACT GAGACA3' and CCYV_CPR- 5' TACGCGCGGCAGAGGAATTT 3'. The respective 462 bp HSP and 375 bp CP amplicons were cloned and sequenced. The partial coat protein gene sequence (MW251342) was 97.86% identical to a CCYV isolate from Shanghai (KY400633). The partial HSP sequence (MW251341) shared 99.73% identity with the recently identified CCYV isolate from California (MH806868). Criniviruses are an emerging group of whitefly-transmitted viruses responsible for worldwide losses of billions of dollars annually (Tzanetakis et al., 2013). CCYV, a member of the genus Crinivirus, was believed to be restricted to Asia, Africa, and the Mediterranean regions of Europe (Bananej et al., 2013; Orfanidou et al., 2014) until it was recently identified in the Imperial Valley of California (Wintermantel et al., 2019). Southern Georgia has been experiencing high whitefly populations, resulting in the emergence of CuLCrV and CYSDV on vegetables in recent years. Because CCYV can produce symptoms virtually identical to those of CYSDV and occurs in mixed infections in cucurbits with other whitefly-transmitted viruses, its epidemiology, role in disease incidence, severity, and impact on economically important crops in the southeastern United States will require further investigation."

Rats were divided into control group, cisplatin-induced nephrotoxic untreated group, nephrotoxic-treated groups with Methimazole, dietary regimen containing raw pumpkin seed (5% and 10%) and roasted pumpkin seed (5% and 10%) for 14 days. Results acquired uncovered that cisplatin intoxication significantly increased (p ≤ .05) the levels of renal biomarkers, arginase activity, 8-hydroxy-21-deoxy guanosine (8-OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as well as significant decrease in functional sulfhydryl groups, nitric oxide levels, and antioxidant enzyme activities in rats' kidney when compared to the control group. These adverse changes, due to cisplatin inebriation in rodents, were in any case, forestalled by pre-treatment with pumpkin seed inclusive diet. This holds promise for the use of pumpkin seed as a food supplement in the management of nephrotoxic-related disorders. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: These results suggest that roasted pumpkin seed appears to be more nephroprotective than the raw pumpkin seed through regulations of arginase activity, enhancement in the antioxidant system, suppression of renal markers and lipid peroxidation. This holds p-omise for the use of roasted pumpkin seed as a food supplement in the management nephrotoxic-related disorders."

      "abstract": "Hydrophobic pollutants are still present in agricultural soil. The Cucurbitaceae family accumulates hydrophobic pollutants through roots, resulting in the contamination of aerial parts. Major latex-like proteins (MLPs), found in the Cucurbitaceae family, play an important role in the contamination by binding to these hydrophobic pollutants. Thus far, efficient cultivation methods for the production of safe crops with lower concentrations of hydrophobic pollutants have not been developed. Herein, we competitively inhibited the binding of MLPs to hydrophobic pollutants, pyrene and dieldrin, in roots by using MLP binding pesticides. By conducting a chemical array screening, we found that MLPs bound compounds with indole- and quinazoline-like structures. Commercially available pesticides amisulbrom and pyrifluquinazon, which possess such structures, successfully inhibited the binding of MLPs to pyrene and dieldrin in vitro. When zucchini plants were cultivated in the contaminated soil with 1.25 mmol/kg pyrene and 12.5 μmol/kg dieldrin, the concentration of pyrene and dieldrin in xylem sap was significantly decreased by 30% and 15%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the pesticides binding to MLPs competitively inhibited the binding of MLPs to pyrene and dieldrin in roots, resulting in the reduction of overall contamination. This study proposes a novel approach to cultivate safer crops and advances the utilization of unknown functions of pesticides.",

      "abstract": "Phytophthora capsici Leonian (PHC) is a filamentous pathogen oomycete that causes root, fruit, foliar and crown rot over a wide host range, including the economically and nutritionally important summer squash (Cucurbita pepo var. cylindrica L.) crop. PHC chemical control strategies are difficult to adopt, due to the limited number of registered chemicals that are permitted and the scalar harvest system. For these reasons, other strategies, such as the use of waste-based composts that can act as suppressive agents against several soilborne pathogens, have been studied intensively. It is well known that compost's microbiota plays an important role to confer its suppressive ability. In this study, four different composts were analyzed with both 16S rRNA gene and 18S rRNA gene real-time PCR amplification and with 26S gene amplicon-based sequencing; the total abundance of the bacterial and fungal communities was found to be higher compared to literature, thus confirming that the four composts were a good inoculum source for agricultural applications. The core mycobiota was mainly composed of 31 genera; nevertheless, it was possible to observe a clear predominance of the same few taxa in all the composts. The four composts were then tested, at different concentrations (1-10-20% v/v), to establish their ability to confer suppressiveness to the Phytophthora capsici (PHC) - Cucurbita pepo pathosystem in controlled greenhouse pot trials. A total of 12 compost mixtures were considered, and of these, one (Trichoderma-enriched compost at 10% v/v) was able to statistically reduce the disease incidence caused by PHC (by 50% compared to the untreated control). Hence, the microbiota composition of the most effective compost treatment was investigated and compared with untreated and chemical (metalaxyl) controls. Mycobiota sequencing showed genera differences between the three treatments, with relative abundances of several fungal genera that were significantly different among the samples. Moreover, PCA analyses clustered the compost treatment differently from the chemical and the untreated controls. These findings suggest that suppressive activity of a compost is strictly influenced by its microbiota and the applied dosage, but the ability to induce a shaping in the rhizosphere microbial composition is also required."

Endophytes, fungi and bacteria that live within plant hosts without impacting the host negatively, have exhibited antagonism to V. dahliae. The objectives of this study were to survey potential V. dahliae-antagonistic endophytes from roots of 'Cinnamon Girl' pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) grown under either polyethylene (PE), an experimental polylactic acid/ poly(hydroxalkanoate) (PLA/PHA) mulch, Weed Guard Plus, or no mulch, as well as from 'Sugar Baby' watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), and 'Tetsukabuto' squash (C. maxima x C. moschata). Four selected endophytes were screened for antagonism against V. dahliae in the laboratory, greenhouse, and field. A total of 777 isolates of potential fungal endophytes were recovered from pumpkin, watermelon, and squash roots between 2015 and 2016 of which 198 isolates were identified down to the genus level. Of those isolates, frequency of isolation was greatest for Dichotomopilus/Chaetomium spp. (5%), Cladosporium spp. (15.2 %), Clonostachys spp. (5.6 %), Epicoccum spp. (22.2 %), and Fusarium spp. (24.7 %). All five genera only weakly associated with roots grown under a particular mulch treatment (Cramer's V = 0.22) or cucurbit host (Cramer's V = 0.1925). In a laboratory culture plate assay, V. dahliae isolate JAW-113 was plated against one of four prospective endophytes (Dichotomopilus sp., Epicoccum sp., Microdochium sp., or Schizothecium sp.). The area under the Verticillium culture growth curve (AUVGC) was significantly highest (P < 0.0001) when V. dahliae was by Schizothecium sp. or Dichotomopilus sp. In a greenhouse study using a Mason jar assay with V. dahliae amended potting mix, pumpkin plant vigor, plant fresh weight, root fresh weight, and root dry weight were significantly higher (P < 0.05) for plants inoculated with Dichotomopilus sp., Epicoccum sp., Microdochium sp., and Schizothecium sp. compared to plants without endophyte inoculation. Subsequent field trials in 2017 and 2018 showed no significant differences in foliar disease severity or fruit yield, regardless of whether plants were inoculated with an endophyte or not. However, recovery of V. dahliae colony forming units from pumpkin stem sap was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) for plants inoculated with either Dichotomopilus sp. or Schizothecium sp. in 2017 or Dichotomopilus sp. in 2018.",

      "abstract": "This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of foliar sprays containing boron (B) nano-fertilizer (NF) on the growth and physiology of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and zucchini (Cucurbita pepo). Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions for 60 days on a modified Hoagland solution with the presence and absence of boron (+B or -B). A synthesized B-NF foliar spray and a commercial B foliar fertilizer (Bortrac™ 150, BT) was applied at a concentration of 30 mg B L-1 at 10-d intervals throughout the experiment. The B-NF treatment increased the growth of lettuce 2.7- and 1.9-fold for shoots and roots, respectively, with an average production of lettuce biomass by ~58%. Similarly, the NF increased the growth of zucchini by 18 and 66% compared with Control-B (the absence of B), and 13 and 36% compared with BT, both for shoots and roots, respectively. Nevertheless, NF + B mostly decreased lettuce growth with symptoms of B toxicity in leaves. In lettuce, addition of B did not affect concentrations of phenols; however, in zucchini, Control-B induced a higher production of phenolic compounds possibly related to B deficiency. The B addition in lettuce reduced the DPPH activity by 32 and 21% in NF and BT, respectively, compared to Control-B. These responses were similar in zucchini; however, the effect of B was product of its presence in mineral solution rather than due the foliar product applied. This suggests that a NF-based delivery system for B may be highly effective at boosting plant productivity on B-limited soils.",

      "abstract": "Freezing vegetables requires pre-treatments to reduce microbial load and destroy enzymes that impair the frozen product quality. So far blanching has been the most effective pre-treatment, preferred by the food industry, despite its severity: heating up to temperatures close to 100 °C for 1-3 min causes sensory and texture changes in most horticultural products. Alternative blanching treatments, using UV-C radiation combined with milder thermal treatments or with thermosonication, may improve the quality of the final frozen vegetables. Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.), the vegetable under study, has an availability in fresh restricted to a season, needing therefore to be often frozen to be used throughout the year. In this study, its surface was first inoculated with two vegetable contaminants, Enterococcus faecalis and Deinococcus radiodurans cells, which are resistant, respectively, to high temperatures and to radiation and then submitted to several blanching treatments, single or combined, and the effect on these microorganisms reduction was evaluated. As single treatments, water blanching (the control treatment, as it is the blanching treatment traditionally used) was applied up to 180 s at temperatures ranging from 65 to 90 °C, and UV-irradiation applied in continuous. As combined pre-treatments, water blanching combined with UV-C (continuous or in pulses), and thermosonication (20 kHz at 50% of power) combined with UV-C pulses were also studied. The continuous UV-C radiation incident irradiance was 11 W/m2 up to 180 s, and the pulses at incident radiance of 67 W/m2, lasting 3.5 s each (35 pulses). Mathematical modeling of bacterial reduction data was carried out using the Bigelow, the Weibull and Weibull modified models, and estimation of their respective kinetic parameters proved that the latter models presented a better fit below 75 °C. The best results proved to be the combination of water blanching at temperatures as low as 85 °C during <2 min with 25 pulses of UV-C (incident irradiance of 67 W/m2) or thermosonication at 90 °C also combined with UV-C pulses, both resulting in 3 log reductions of both microorganisms under study. These results proved to overcome what industry is requiring so far (a 2 log microbial reduction in 3 min), hence minimizing quality changes of frozen zucchini.",

Patients documented overactive bladder symptoms and quality of life using questionnaires as well as diaries recording day- and nighttime micturition frequencies, urine leakages during physical activity or at sneezing or coughing, and use of incontinence pads. The full analysis set included 117 women (age: 21 - 78 y). Urination frequency decreased significantly with improvement during daytime in 49, 71, and 77 (out of 99) patients and at night in 45, 63, and 70 (out of 100) patients after 1, 6, and 12 wk, respectively. The mean frequency of leakages and used pads decreased significantly from 0.9 leakages and 2.0 pads at baseline to 0.4 leakages and 1.4 pads after 12 wk. In all measured aspects of overactive bladder-related quality of life, (coping, concern, sleep, social), statistically significant improvement was reached after 1 wk, with further improvement at 6 and 12 wk. Ninety-nine percent of the physicians and 95.4% of the patients rated tolerability as \"very good\" or \"good\". Treatment with Granu Fink femina progressively improved overactive bladder symptoms and related quality of life with significant improvements already after 1 wk. Based on these effects and the observed excellent tolerability profile, Granu Fink femina may be considered a valuable therapeutic option for overactive bladder.",

TEM images confirmed the formation of NPs with average size of 8 nm. XRD showed the crystalline nature of prepared ZnO NPs. This shows that the ZnO NPs induced cytotoxicity that affected the proliferation of MG63 osteoblast-like cells in a concentration dependent manner. Further, the ZnO NPs induced reduction in cell proliferation was confirmed by Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA) staining. FDA staining results showed a reduction in fluorescence intensity with an increase in the concentration of ZnO NPs. The untreated control which was unaffected showed the highest fluorescence compared to ZnO NPs treated samples. A significantly diminished fluorescence was observed in samples incubated with 80 ppm ZnO NPs.

METHODS: A total of 86 women aged from 32 to 88 with SUI (grade 1 = 44, grade 2 = 42) were enrolled in the study and followed-up for six weeks (point 1) and twelve weeks (point 2). The primary outcome of the study was evaluated by changes in day-time and nocturnal urinary frequency (bathroom visits) and urinary incontinence episodes (leaks). Also, adverse events were quantified as well as the self-perceived effectiveness of the treatment. Research Ethics Board approval was obtained for this study. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment there was a 30% (grade 1 SUI, p < 0.01), and 35% (grade 2 SUI, p < 0.01) improvement in urinary incontinence episodes, a 40% (grade 1 SUI, p < 0.01) and 26% (grade 2 SUI, p < 0.01) improvement in day-time urination frequency and 64% (grade 1 SUI, p < 0.01) and 54% (grade 2 SUI, p < 0.01) improvement in nocturnal urinary frequency. Reported side effects were: headache (3.5%), flatulence (4.1%) and gastrointestinal discomfort (3%). A total of 89.4 % of women in the study reported no side effects from this therapy and 97% acknowledged improvement of symptoms. CONCLUSION: This clinical study demonstrated that a 12 week treatment with a mix of Cucurbita Pepo Seed extract, Equisetum arvense and Linum usitatissimum - Flax A (CELcomplex®) is highly effective on stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with minimum adverse events. Further studies may be needed in order to determine the effectiveness and efficacy of this phytotherapy in other populations."

The plants were grown in nutrient solution with different iron sources: (i) Fe(II)-EDTA, (ii) without Fe(II)-EDTA (iii) SPIONs only, and (iv) Fe(II)-EDTA with SPIONs. Plant growth and development were assessed after 20 days of soaking by measuring phenological parameters such as plant biomass, chlorophyll content, amount of carotenoids, and the catalase enzyme activity. Transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and vibrating sample magnetometer methods were used to detect uptake and translocation of SPIONs in plant tissues. Our results showed that SPIONs treatment (without Fe(II)-EDTA) caused growth retardation and decreased the plant biomass and chlorophyll content. Hence, they are not efficient sources to compensate for iron demand of squash plant. Electron microscopy observations, magnetization and elemental analyses revealed that SPIONs are taken-up by plant roots but not translocate to upper organs. In roots, SPIONs use a symplastic route for intercellular transfer. These findings suggest that as an iron source, SPIONs alone are not efficient for plant growth, but can contribute it together with Fe(II)-EDTA.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy female albino mice were divided into four groups: normal control, infected control with H. nana, infected and treated with PZQ, and lastly, the group infected and treated with pumpkin seeds' extract. RESULTS: Pumpkin seeds aqueous extract showed a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the number and length of H. nana adult worms, number and viability of eggs in comparison to the infected control group and PZQ group. Pumpkin seed aqueous extract is proven to be an effective anthelmintic against H. nana.

      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and temperature on the valuable pharmaceuticals expression in a virus-mediated transient expression system, and so the Zuchini Yellow Mosaic Virus (ZYMV) based vector was used for transferring the GFP reporter gene and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) gene (K2S) to cucurbit (Cucurbita pepo L.). MeJA, temperature and time (days after inoculation), were evaluated as a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design (CRD). At first, the effect of all treatment combinations on GFP expression was assessed. At this step, the ELISA test was used to select the optimum treatment combination. ELISA method revealed the significant difference between applied treatments. The optimized treatment significantly increased the expression of rtPA compared to the control. The Real-Time PCR reaction for both GFP and rtPA genes showed no significant differences between optimum and control treatments, however, transcripts of the small subunit of RuBisCO were extremely down-regulated in optimum treatment condition. Reduction in RuBisCO expression at protein level was tangible under treatment condition based on the ELISA test. Therefore, it can be inferred that suppressing the expression of RuBisCO, probably resulted in higher access of expression system to free amino acids inside the cell. In this study, MeJA has been shown to be a positive factor, but the low temperature (17 °C), unlike previous studies, suppressed the expression of recombinant protein unexpectedly, probably due to the incompatibility of the viral construct with low temperature. In conclusion, the use of a suitable gene construct, which is not sensitive to temperature, is likely to result in a more favorable outcome.",

Increasing enzymatic conversion, which the complex macromolecules converted into simpler molecules, is still had to be overcome. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP), an emerging technology, is expected to ameliorate the situation. The effects of enzymatic hydrolysis after HHP pretreatment on pumpkin lignocellulose were studied and compared with hydrothermal and alkaline pretreatment. Further investigation was performed to evaluate the effect of enzymatic hydrolysis of pumpkin combined with HHP treatment. The samples underwent HHP treatment simultaneously exhibited overall better performance in enzymatic hydrolysis than the untreated. The highest glucose yield of 91.2% and xylose yield of 84.2% was achieved when 400 MPa HHP with high enzyme loading was applied. HHP exerted positive effects on enzyme-substrate interactions during the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose, which implied that HHP technology combined with enzymatic hydrolysis could be used to pretreat pumpkin pomace.",

Therefore, the discovery of a novel schistosomicidal drug is an urgent priority. This study was designed to evaluate treatment with Cucurbita pepo L. (pumpkin) seed oil (PSO) alone and combined with PZQ against S. mansoni in experimentally infected mice. The study involved five groups: GI was the normal control; GII was the infected control; GIII was treated with an oral dose of PZQ of 500 mg/kg/day for two successive days, starting in the sixth week post infection; GIV was treated with an oral dose of PSO of 50 mg/kg/day for four weeks, starting in the fourth week post infection; and GV was treated with combined PSO-PZQ. Worm burden, tissue egg load and oogram pattern were estimated, and the ultrastructure alterations were examined. Histopathological examination of granuloma diameters, collagen deposition (Picro Sirius red stain), and angiogenesis (immunohistochemical expression of CD34+) was conducted and serum liver enzymes were measured to assess the liver condition. Moreover, the oxidative stress was evaluated by determining the amounts of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase in liver homogenates. The results revealed significant changes in all the assessed parameters with PSO administration. However, PZQ was significantly more effective as an antiparasitic agent, whereas PSO was better in terms of fibrosis and oxidative stress. The most significant results were obtained in group V, which may be attributed to a synergy between PZQ and PSO, with antiparasitic, antioxidant and antifibrotic properties.",

The aim of this study was to determine the antiobesity activity of methanolic leaf extracts of these plants in progesterone-induced obese mice. The activity of the methanolic leaf extracts was orally bioscreened in progesterone-induced obese mice at 200 mg/kg/bw and 400 mg/kg/bw. Body mass index was calculated once per week for four weeks and blood samples were obtained at the end of the experiment for lipid profile analysis. Antiobesity activities of the extracts were compared with the controls. Leaf extracts of A. dubius, C. pepo, and V. unguiculata, at dose concentrations of 200 mg/kgbw and 400 mg/kgbw, showed significant effects on body mass index (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the three extracts on lipid parameter profiles (p > 0.05). The present study showed high food intake in the negative control group as compared with normal control, positive control, and treatment groups. These extracts contained various phytochemicals such as saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and steroids and therefore validate use of aforementioned plants in the suppression of obesity and their use for management of obesity is recommended."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Phytotherapeutic compounds are largely used in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) due to low side-effect profiles and costs, high level of acceptance by patients and a low rate of dropout. Here, we aimed to analyze all available evidence on the role of Cucurbita pepo in the treatment of LUTS-BPH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In May 2016 a systematic search was carried out thorough National Library of Medicine Pubmed, Scopus database and the ISI Web of Knowledge official website in order to identify all published studies on Cucurbita pepo and BPH. The following search strings were used: \"Cucurbita pepo\" OR \"pumpkin seed\" AND \"prostate\"; \"Cucurbita pepo\" AND \"antiandrogen\" OR \"antiproliferative\" OR \"anti-inflammatory\" OR \"antioxidant activities\"; \"cucurbita pepo\" OR \"pumpkin seed\" AND \"LUTS\" AND \"symptoms improvement\" OR \"quality of life\". We consider for the present analysis only studies related to LUTS-BPH. RESULTS: Among all 670 screened, 16 were related to LUTSBPH and finally analyzed. Among all, ten of them were performed in \"in vitro setting\" showing anti-inflammatory and antiandrogen effect, and a reduction in prostate growth and detrusor activity, while six were clinical studies. In all studies an improvement in International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) and uroflowmetry parameters has been reported. In 4 studies, an improvement in quality of life has been reported. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our narrative review, the use of Cucurbita pepo in the management of patients affected by LUTS-BPH seems to be useful for improving symptoms and quality of life. However, future clinical trials are requested to confirm these promising results.",

The treatment of C. pepo cotyledons with different concentrations (100-600 μmol) of different auxins [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole butyric acid (IBA), indole propionic acid (IPA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)]; or with different concentrations (100-300 μmol) of different cytokinins [kinetin, zeatin and benzyladenine (6-BA)] resulted in a significant increase of urease activity, compared to control. The optimal effects were recorded for each of 500 μmol of IAA and 300 μmol of zeatin treatments. A gradual increase in urease activity was detected in cotyledons treated with various concentrations (0.2-1.0 mM) of 28-homobrassinolide (HBL), in relative to control. A substantial increase in urease activity was observed in cotyledons subjected to different concentrations of triazole (10-60 mg L(-1)), containing either triadimefon (TDM) or hexaconazole (HEX), compared to control. The combination of 300 μmol zeatin with any of protein inhibitors, namely 5-fluorouridine (FUrd), cordycepin and α-amanitin, resulted in the alleviation of their inhibitory effect on the urease activity.",

In the present study, protective effect of Cucurbita pepo fruit peel against CCl4-induced neurotoxicity in rats was investigated. In this study, 36 Sprague-Dawley female rats (190±15 g) were randomly divided into 6 groups of 6 rats each. Group I was given 1 ml/kg bw (body weight) of corn oil intraperotoneally (i.p); Group II, III and IV were treated with 20% CCl4 in corn oil (1ml/kg bw i.p.). However, animals of Group III and IV were also treated with CPME (methanol extract of C. pepo fruit peel) at 200 and 400mg/kg bw respectively. Animals of Group V and VI were administered only with CPME at 200 and 400mg/kg bw respectively. These treatments were administered 3 days a week for two weeks. Administration of CCl4 cause acute neurotoxicity as depicted by significant depletion (p<0.05) in the activities of antioxidant enzymes; catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, quinone reductase, while enhanced the γ-glutamyl transferase level in brain samples. CCl4 intoxication decreased the reduced glutathione (GSH) level whereas markedly (p<0.05) enhanced lipid peroxidation in brain samples. Co-treatment of CPME significantly (p<0.05) protected the brain tissues against CCl4 constituted injuries by restoring activities of antioxidant enzymes and ameliorated lipid peroxidation in a dose dependent fashion. These neuroprotective effects might be due to the presence of antioxidant constituents.",

The initial conditions at which the highest DY106 decolourization yield was obtained were found at pH 2, temperature 20 degrees C, H2O2 dose 1 mmol/L (FCP) and 100 mmol/L (ICP). The highest decolourization rates were obtained for dye concentrations 50 mg/L (FCP) and 80 mg/L (ICP). Under optimal conditions, the FCP was able to decolorize more than 87% of the dye within 2 min.

One concern is that systemic insecticides may translocate from the soil into pollen and nectar of plants, where they would be ingested by pollinators. This paper reports on the movement of two such systemic neonicotinoid insecticides, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, into the pollen and nectar of flowers of squash (Cucurbita pepo cultivars \"Multipik,\" \"Sunray\" and \"Bush Delicata\") when applied to soil by two methods: (1) sprayed into soil before seeding, or (2) applied through drip irrigation in a single treatment after transplant. All insecticide treatments were within labeled rates for these compounds. Pollen and nectar samples were analyzed using a standard extraction method widely used for pesticides (QuEChERS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometric analysis. The concentrations found in nectar, 10 ± 3 ppb (mean ± s.d) for imidacloprid and 11 ± 6 ppb for thiamethoxam, are higher than concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides in nectar of canola and sunflower grown from treated seed, and similar to those found in a recent study of neonicotinoids applied to pumpkins at transplant and through drip irrigation. The concentrations in pollen, 14 ± 8 ppb for imidacloprid and 12 ± 9 ppb for thiamethoxam, are higher than those found for seed treatments in most studies, but at the low end of the range found in the pumpkin study. Our concentrations fall into the range being investigated for sublethal effects on honey bees and bumble bees.",

Groups 1 and 2 received the treatment for three consecutive days, orally, at intervals of 7 days, totaling nine administrations. The Albendazole 5 % was administered one time, at the beginning of the experiment, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The groups treated with pumpkin seed showed a significant decrease in egg counts per gram of feces (EPG), wherein group 2 (1 g/kg l. w.) was the most effective.

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to examine the effect of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) seeds supplementation on atherogenic diet-induced atherosclerosis. Rat were divided into two main groups , normal control and atherogenic control rats , each group composed of three subgroups one of them supplemented with 2% arginine in drinking water and the other supplemented with pumpkin seeds in diet at a concentration equivalent to 2% arginine. Supplementation continued for 37 days. Atherogenic rats supplemented with pumpkin seeds showed a significant decrease (p<0.001) in their serum concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL - C as they dropped from 4.89 mmol / L to 2.55 mmol /L and from 3.33 mmol / L to 0.70 mmol / L respectively. Serum concentrations of HDL-C were also significantly elevated in the same group. Although, atherogenic rats supplemented with 2% arginine showed significant increase in serum concentration of HDL-C, no significant changes were observed in their serum concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-C. Our results showed that treatment of atherogenic rats with pumpkin seeds significantly decreased serum concentrations of TC and LDL-C. Our findings suggest that pumpkin seeds supplementation has a protective effect against atherogenic rats and this protective effect was not attributed to the high arginine concentrations in pumpkin seeds.",

Pruning was implemented to increase plant biomass close to the root where PCB concentration is known to be highest.

The encouragement of nodal adventitious roots at stem nodes did significantly increase the PCB concentration in the primary stem, while not affecting shoot biomass.

Howden pumpkins were grown in 100 g of DDT contaminated soil ([DDT] - 1100 ng/g) mixed with equal volumes of either clean soil, perlite, vermiculite, peat, potting soil, or granular activated carbon (GAC) to give total organic carbon contents of 2.4%, 2.5%, 2.6%, 11.5%, 12.2%, and 27.3%, respectively. As in other studies, root DDT concentrations were significantly lower in soils with high organic matter. Root bioaccumulation factors (BAF = [DDT]root/[DDT]soil) approximated this trend. Root concentrations correlated with organic matter concentrations and not with soil DDT concentrations. Conversely, shoot DDT concentrations, shoot BAFs and translocation factors (TLF = BAF(shoot)/BAF(root)) were not significantly different between treatment groups, except for plants grown in GAC/DDT soil. This suggests that amendments with a range of organic matter contents may be added to improve soil conditions at industrial sites without significant adverse effects on phytoextraction potential of C. pepo ssp. pepo.",

Especially glutathione was found to play a major role in Cd detoxification as Cd shows a high binding affinity towards thiols and as glutathione is a precursor for Pc synthesis. In the present study, we have used an immunohistochemical approach combined with computer-supported transmission electron microscopy in order to measure changes in the subcellular distribution of glutathione during Cd-stress in mesophyll cells and cells of different glandular trichomes (long and short stalked) of Cucurbita pepo L. subsp. pepo var. styriaca GREB: . Even though no ultrastructural alterations were observed in leaf and glandular trichome cells after the treatment of plants with 50 microM cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) for 48 h, all cells showed a large decrease in glutathione contents. The strongest decrease was found in nuclei and the cytosol (up to 76%) in glandular trichomes which are considered as a major side of Cd accumulation in leaves. The ratio of glutathione between the cytosol and nuclei and the other cell compartments was strongly decreased only in glandular trichomes (more than 50%) indicating that glutathione in these two cell compartments is especially important for the detoxification of Cd in glandular trichomes. Additionally, these data indicate that large amounts of Cd are withdrawn from nuclei during Cd exposure. The present study gives a detailed insight into the compartment-specific importance of glutathione during Cd exposure in mesophyll cells and glandular trichomes of C. pepo L. plants.",

      "abstract": "Darkness mediates different senescence-related responses depending on the targeting of dark treatment (whole plants or individual leaves) and on the organs that perceive the signal (leaves or cotyledons). As no data are available on the potential role of darkness to promote senescence when applied to individual cotyledons, we have investigated how darkness affects the progression of senescence in either a single or both individually darkened cotyledons of young 10-day-old Cucurbita pepo (zucchini) seedlings. Strong acceleration of senescence was observed when both cotyledons were darkened as judged by the damage in their anatomical structure, deterioration of chloroplast ultrastructure in parallel with decreased photosynthetic rate and photochemical quantum efficiency of PSII. In addition, the endogenous levels of cytokinins (CKs) and IAA were strongly reduced. In a single individually darkened cotyledon, the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus as well as the contents of endogenous CKs and IAA were much less affected by darkness, thus suggesting inhibitory effect of the illuminated cotyledon on the senescence of the darkened one. Apparently, the effect of darkness to accelerate/delay senescence in a single darkened cotyledon depends on the light status of the other cotyledon from the pair. The close positive correlation between CK content and the activity of CK oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX; EC 1.4.3.18/1.5.99.12) suggested that CKX was essentially involved in the mechanisms of downregulation of endogenous CK levels. Our results indicated that CKX-regulated CK signaling could be a possible regulatory mechanism controlling senescence in individually darkened cotyledons.",

In comparison to the untreated leaves, ZYMV infected leaves showed many symptoms, including severe mosaic, size reduction, stunting and deformation. Results from analysis of physiological parameters indicated that viral infection and SA treatments affected metabolism. Viral infection decreased pigment, protein and carbohydrate levels. But with all SA treatments, the protein and carbohydrate contents are noticeably increased. Moreover, the other biochemical parameters showed variable alterations. The peroxidase (POX, EC 1.11.1.7) activity and proline contents were induced by both viral infection and SA treatments. In addition, protein patterns represent some newly synthesized polypeptides which reflect formation of pathogenesis related proteins in all treatments. SA treatment increases the plant resistance against ZYMV. This can be noticed through reduction of percentage of the infected plants, decrease in disease severity and virus concentration of the plants treated with SA then inoculated with virus. All results show significant changes in metabolism affected by either viral infection or SA treatments and also indicate that exogenous SA plays an important role in induction of defense mechanism against ZYMV infection.",

They were inoculated with zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) 10 days later. The effects of OTC treatment and ZYMV infection on glutathione levels were examined at the subcellular level by immunogold labeling of glutathione using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). These effects were further tested at the whole-tissue level by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Such tests were carried out a) on roots, cotyledons and the first true leaves immediately after OTC treatment in order to analyze to which extent OTC increases glutathione levels in different cell compartments as well as in the whole organ; and b) in older and younger leaves and in roots three weeks after ZYMV inoculation in order to study how possible effects of OTC on symptom development would correlate with glutathione levels at the subcellular level and in the whole organ. Immunocytological and biochemical investigations revealed that, 48 h after OTC treatment, glutathione content had increased in all investigated organs, up to 144% in peroxisomes of cotyledons. Three weeks after ZYMV inoculation, glutathione labeling density had significantly increased within intact cells of infected leaves, up to 124% in the cytosol of younger leaves. Roots showed decreased amounts of glutathione in the TEM. Biochemical studies revealed that OTC treatment resulted in 41 and 51% higher glutathione content in older and younger ZYMV-infected leaves, respectively, in comparison to untreated and ZYMV-infected plants. Evaluation of symptom development at this point revealed that all untreated ZYMV-infected plants had symptoms, whereas only 42% of OTC-treated ZYMV-infected plants showed signs of symptoms. Quantification of ZYMV particles revealed that all organs of OTC-treated and ZYMV-infected plants contained significantly decreased amounts of ZYMV particles over a period of five weeks when compared to the same organs of untreated ZYMV-infected plants. We can conclude that OTC treatment and subsequently elevated glutathione contents within Styrian oil pumpkin plants led to a strong decrease in virus content, which was accompanied by a suppression of ZYMV-induced symptoms as well as reduced and delayed symptom development within plants exhibiting symptoms.",

The jasmonate inhibitory effect on chlorophyll content and chloroplast transcriptional activity was stronger compared with darkness. Further, MeJA reduced the photosynthetic rate whereas darkness did not affect photosynthesis. Neither stress factor affected the photochemical quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) estimated by the variable fluorescence (F(v))/maximal fluorescence (F(m)) ratio, suggesting the existence of mechanisms protecting the functional activity of PSII at earlier stages of senescence, thus making this parameter more stable compared to others used to quantify senescence. Both stress factors caused a decrease in the content of physiologically active cytokinins, especially trans-zeatin (Z), with the jasmonate effect being much more pronounced when compared to darkness. Our results indicate that MeJA is a more potent inducer of senescence in zucchini cotyledons, at least within the relatively short period of the 24h treatment. This is likely due to its stronger down-regulatory effect on the levels of physiologically active cytokinins.",

Subsequently the effects of the isolate on the plasma activity levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase against acetaminophen induced acute liver injury in low-protein fed male Sprague-Dawley rats were ascertained. The rats were maintained on a low-protein diet for 5 days and divided into three subgroups. Two subgroups were injected with acetaminophen and the other with an equivalent amount of polyethylene glycol 400. Two hours after intoxication one of the two subgroups was administered with the protein isolate. Rats from the different subgroups were killed at 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment. After 5 days on the low-protein diet the activity levels of the enzymes were significantly higher than their counterparts on a normal balanced diet. The administration of protein isolate after acetaminophen intoxication resulted in significantly reduced activity levels. It is concluded that the protein isolate has promising antioxidative properties. Furthermore, the isolate administration was effective in alleviating the detrimental effects associated with protein malnutrition and acetaminophen intoxication.",

The effects of two soil amendments, mycorrhizae or a biosurfactant, on p,p'-DDE accumulation was determined. Also, p,p'-DDE uptake was assessed during plant growth (12, 26, 38, and 62 d), and cultivars that accumulate weathered p,p'-DDE were intercropped with cultivars known not to have that ability. Cucurbita pepo L. ssp. pepo accumulated large amounts of the contaminant, having stem bioconcentration factors, amounts of p,p'-DDE translocated, and contaminant phytoextraction that were 14, 9.9, and 5.0 times greater than C. pepo L. ssp. ovifera (L.) D.S. Decker, respectively. During 62 d, the stem BCF (bioconcentration factor) for p,p'-DDE in subspecies pepo remained constant and the total amount of contaminant accumulated was correlated with plant biomass (r(2) = 0.86). For subspecies ovifera, the stem BCF was highest at 12 d (1.5) but decreased to 0.39 by 62 d, and p,p'-DDE removal was not correlated with plant biomass. Mycorrhizal inoculation increased p,p'-DDE accumulation by both subspecies by an average 4.4 times. For subspecies pepo, mycorrhizae increased the percentage of contaminant extracted from 0.72 to 2.1%. Biosurfactant amendment also enhanced contaminant accumulation by both subspecies, although treatment reduced subspecies ovifera biomass by 60%. The biosurfactant had no effect on the biomass of subspecies pepo, increased the average contaminant concentration by 3.6-fold, and doubled the overall amount of p,p'-DDE removed from the soil. Soil amendments that enhance the mobility of weathered persistent organic pollutants will significantly increase the amount of contaminant phytoextraction by Cucurbita pepo.",

      "abstract": "The intracellular effects of GSH (reduced glutathione) and BSO (buthionine sulfoximine) treatment on glutathione content were investigated with immunogold labeling in individual cellular compartments of Cucurbita pepo L. seedlings. Generally, GSH treatment led to increased levels of glutathione in roots and leaves (up to 3.5-fold in nuclei), whereas BSO treatment significantly decreased glutathione content in all organs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that glutathione levels in mitochondria, which showed the highest glutathione labeling density of all compartments, remained generally unaffected by both treatments. Since glutathione within mitochondria is involved in the regulation of cell death, these results indicate that high and stable levels of glutathione in mitochondria play an important role in cell survival strategies. BSO treatment significantly decreased glutathione levels (1) in roots by about 78% in plastids and 60.8% in the cytosol and (2) in cotyledons by about 55% in the cytosol and 38.6% in plastids. After a short recovery period, glutathione levels were significantly increased in plastids and the cytosol of root tip cells (up to 3.7-fold) and back to control values in cotyledons. These results indicate that plastids, either alone or together with the cytosol, are the main center of glutathione synthesis in leaves as well as in roots. After GSH treatment for 24 h, severe ultrastructural damage related to increased levels of glutathione was found in roots, in all organelles except mitochondria. Possible negative effects of GSH treatment leading to the observed ultrastructural damage are discussed.",

Yield and ETS activity were higher when solar UV-B was filtered out. The results suggested that the decreased yield was related to the UV-B impaired flow of electrons in the respiratory chain. Selenium increased yield under ambient radiation conditions. However, no significant effect of excluding UV-B radiation or of treatment with selenium was observed on the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII).",

The treatment of 5-day-old pumpkin seedlings with 50 microM aluminium sulphate resulted in approximately 60% inhibition of root growth within 48-60 h of treatment, while aluminium accumulated in the roots reaching a maximum within 48h. During the same period, the hydrogen peroxide content of the roots was strongly enhanced. The increased level of hydrogen peroxide was matched by both increased ascorbate peroxidase (APX) (EC 1.11.1.11) activity and ascorbate free radical reductase (AFRR) (EC 1.1.5.4) activity, while dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) (EC 1.8.5.1) and glutathione reductase (GR) (EC 1.6.4.2) did not change. The levels of AsA in the roots were also increased by the Al treatment. It was concluded that an oxidative burst is probably involved in the toxicity of Al in pumpkin roots and that plants react to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species by expressing higher levels of scavenging systems such as the AsA-APX system.",

Beetles damage flowers and fruits and chew dime-sized holes in leaf tissue between major veins. Inbred plants were found to be more likely to be damaged by beetles and to have more leaves damaged per plant than outcrossed plants. A positive linear association was found between the coefficient of inbreeding and the magnitude of leaf damage, whereas a negative association was found between coefficient of inbreeding and several male and female fitness traits. When pesticides were used to control beetle herbivory, the interaction between coefficient of inbreeding and pesticide treatment was significant for fruit production and marginally significant for pollen quantity per anther. Therefore, the magnitude of inbreeding depression in C. pepo ssp. texana varies depending on the severity of beetle herbivory.",

      "abstract": "It is generally understood that the inhibition of growth of root apices is the initial effect caused by aluminium (Al) toxicity. The correlation between impaired H+-fluxes across the plasma membrane (PM) and Al-induced growth inhibition, Al accumulation and callose formation in root apices of squash (Cucurbita pepo L. cv. Tetsukabuto) is reported here. The root inhibition was dependent on Al concentration, and the duration of exposure, with the damage occurring preferentially in regions with high Al accumulation and callose formation. Using the fluorescent Al indicator (Morin), Al was localized in the cell walls of the root-tip cells after 3 h and in the whole root-tip cells after 6 h of the Al treatment (50 micro M). The inhibition of H+-pumping rate in the highly purified PM vesicles obtained from the Al-treated apical root portions (1 cm) coincided with the inhibition of root growth under Al stress. Furthermore, H+-ATPase activity of PM vesicles prepared from the control root apices was strongly inhibited by Al in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Approximately 50% inhibition was observed when PM vesicles were preincubated at Al concentration as low as 10 micro M followed by the enzyme assay in the medium without Al. Using the pH indicator (bromocresol purple), it is shown that surface pH of the control (0 Al) root apices was strongly alkalized from the starting pH of 4.5 in a time-dependent manner. By contrast, the surface pH changed only slightly in the Al-treated root apices. The changes in surface pH mediated by altered dynamics of H+ efflux and influx across the root tip PM play an important role in root growth as affected by Al.",

UV-C treated slices had higher respiration rates than controls; however, the ethylene production of the slices was not affected by UV-C treatments. Slight UV-C irradiation damage (reddish brown discoloration) was detected on the surface of 10 and 20 min-treated slices after 12 days of storage at 10 degrees C. Slices stored at 5 degrees C did not show UV-C damage. Chilling injury was not observed until after 20 days of storage at 5 degrees C. The symptoms of chilling injury appeared as dried sunken brown spots on the surface of cortex tissue. UV-C treatments did not affect the degree of chilling injury during storage at 5 degrees C. UV-C treatment also had no consistent effect on sugar or malic acid concentrations. The most pronounced effect of UV-C irradiation was to retard microbial growth thereby providing a basis for the frequently observed delay in senescence and subsequent deterioration in fruit tissues."

In the course of the photoinhibitory illumination, FM, FV/FM and the amount of functional PS II declined continuously whereas FO dropped rapidly to some extent and then slowly increased. If the experiments were done at room temperature, termination of the photoinhibitory illumination resulted in partial relaxation of the FV/FM ratio and in an increase in FO and FM. The relaxation was completed in 10-15 min after short-term (15 min) photoinhibitory treatment but continued 30-40 min if the exposure to high light was longer than 1 h. No changes in the amount of functional PS II accompanied the relaxation of FV/FM in darkness or in low light, in the presence of lincomycin. Transferring the leaves to low temperature (+4°C) after the room-temperature illumination (2 h) completely inhibited the relaxation of FV/FM. Low temperature did not suppress the relaxation if the photoinhibitory illumination had also been done at low temperature. The results indicate that illumination of lincomycin-poisoned pumpkin leaves at room temperature does not lead to accumulation of a reversibly photoinactivated intermediate."

Using IgG against the 32 kDa endonuclease we have found in the DNA-protein blot assay that this protein is one of the proteins binding SAR DNA. We have identified three proteins with molecular mass of 65 kDa, 60 kDa and 32 kDa which are responsible for SAR DNA binding in the gel mobility shift assay experiments.",

The symptoms of photoinhibition appearing during light treatments at room temperature could be attributed to a decrease in the primary activity of PSII. However, when the light treatment was given at 1 degrees C, the quantum yield of photosynthetic oxygen evolution decreased much more than would be expected from the decrease in the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence at 77 degrees K. Also, light treatment at 1 degrees C lowered the chloroplast wholechain electron transfer capacity much more than it affected PSII electron transport (H(2)O to paraphenylbenzoquinone). Light treatments at both room temperature and 1 degrees C led to an increase in B(max), which indicates an increase in the proportion of PSII(beta) centers. PSI was not affected by the light treatments, and the treatments in the dark at 1 degrees C caused only minor changes in the measured properties of the leaves. We conclude that high light always inhibits the primary activity of PSII, but at low temperature there is greater inhibition of electron transfer from primary electron accepting plastoquinone of PSII to the plastoquinone pool, which leads to a drastic decrease in the quantum yield of oxygen evolution in the chilling-sensitive pumpkin."

Binding of the anion with 'high affinity' (K greater than 5000 M-1) produces a broad increase of absorption in the 400-500 nm region (delta epsilon approximately 1000 M-1.cm-1) and c.d. activity in the 300-450 nm region, whereas azide binding with 'low affinity' (K approximately 100 M-1) is characterized by an intense absorption band at 420 nm (delta epsilon = 6000 M-1.cm-1), corresponding to negative c.d. activity and a decrease of absorption at 330 nm (delta epsilon = -2000 M-1.cm-1). The high-affinity binding involves a minor fraction of the protein containing Type 3 copper in the reduced state, and the spectral features of this azide adduct can be eliminated by treatment of the native enzyme with small amounts of H2O2, followed by dialysis before azide addition. As shown by e.s.r. spectroscopy, Type 2 copper is involved in both types of binding, its signal being converted into that of a species with small hyperfine splitting constant [12 mT (approximately 120 G)] in the case of the low-affinity azide adduct. The spectral similarities of the two types of azide adducts with the corresponding adducts formed by native laccase, which also exhibits Type 3 copper heterogeneity, are discussed.",

Treatment of cotyledons with both cytokinins resulted in a rapid enhancement of nuclear RNA-polymerase-I activity (EC 2.7.7.6). Maximum stimulation of RNA polymerase I, responsible for rRNA synthesis, was observed 4-6 h after the start of cytokinin action. The activity of RNA polymerase II was stimulated much more slowly and to a lesser extent. Uridine 5'-monophosphate-uridine analysis of the alkalidigested nascent pre-rRNA chains showed that the stimulation of RNA-polymerase-I activity was the consequence of an increase of the polyribonucleotide-clongation rate. No significant change in the number of transcribing enzyme molecules was defected after hormone treatment (86·10(3) RNA-polymerase-I molecules per diploid genome).Indications that de-novo protein synthesis is necessary for cytokinin-mediated RNA-polymerase stimulation were derived from experiments showing inhibition by cycloheximide."

The enzyme activities per cotyledon increase markedly during the germination process, but the proportion of enhancement depends on the type of enzyme species. The increase in enzyme activities is due to de novo synthesis as shown by cycloheximide treatment and is influenced by phytohormones (cytokinins and abscissic acid). In isolated cotyledons exogenous cytokinin (benzyladenine) obviously can replace the effect of the embryo as the source of endogenous hormone. Abscissic acid counteracts the cytokinin effect. It is suggested that aminopeptidases have a biological function in reserve protein degradation of the cotyledons during seed germination. Our results do not support the assumption that the embryonic axis of the growing seedling serves as a \"sink\" of proteolytic products resulting in an activation of peptide hydrolases in the cotyledons, but rather de novo synthesis of these enzymes seems to be controlled by substances (phytohormones) originating from the embryo.",

Although absorbance of UV-B radiation by extracted pigments increased substantially, UV-B radiation attenuation apparently was insufficient to protect completely the photosynthetic apparatus or leaf growth processes. Leaf expansion was repressed by daily exposure to 1365 Joules per meter per day of biologically effective UV-B radiation but not by exposure to 660 Joules per meter per day. Photosynthesis measured through ontogenesis of the first leaf was depressed by both UV-B radiation treatments. Repression of photosynthesis by UV-B radiation was especially evident during the ontogenetic period of maximum photosynthetic activity."
