      "abstract": "The search for more effective and safer cancer therapies has led to an increasing interest in combination treatments that use well-established agents. Here we explore the potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a compound derived from cannabis, to enhance the anticancer effects of etoposide in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although CBD is primarily used to manage childhood epilepsy, its broader therapeutic applications are being actively investigated, particularly in oncology. Our results revealed that, among various tested chemotherapeutic drugs, etoposide showed the most significant reduction in NSCLC cell viability when combined with CBD. To understand this synergistic effect, we conducted extensive transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, which showed that the combination of CBD and etoposide upregulated genes associated with autophagic cell death while downregulating key oncogenes known to drive tumor progression. This dual effect on cell death and oncogene suppression was mediated by inactivation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of cell growth and survival, and was found to be dependent on the p53 status. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that this combination therapy did not rely on traditional cannabinoid receptors or transient receptor potential cation channels, indicating that CBD exerts its anticancer effects through novel, noncanonical mechanisms. The findings suggest that the combination of CBD with etoposide could represent a groundbreaking approach to NSCLC treatment, particularly in cases where conventional therapies fail. By inducing autophagic cell death and inhibiting oncogenic pathways, this therapeutic strategy offers a promising new avenue for enhancing treatment efficacy in NSCLC, especially in tumors with p53 function."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the regulatory effect of cannabidiol (CBD) on circadian rhythm sleep disorders following general anesthesia and explore its potential mechanism in a rat model of propofol-induced rhythm sleep disorder. METHODS: An electrode was embedded in the skull for cortical EEG recording in 24 male SD rats, which were randomized into control, propofol, CBD treatment, and diazepam treatment groups (n=6). Eight days later, a single dose of propofol (10 mg/kg) was injected via the tail vein with anesthesia maintenance for 3 h in the latter 3 groups, and daily treatment with saline, CBD or diazepam was administered via gavage; the control rats received only saline injection. A wireless system was used for collecting EEG, EMG, and body temperature data within 72 h after propofol injection. After data collection, blood samples and hypothalamic tissue samples were collected for determining serum levels of oxidative stress markers and hypothalamic expressions of the key clock proteins. RESULTS: Compared with the control rats, the rats with CBD treatment showed significantly increased sleep time at night (20:00-6:00), especially during the time period of 4:00-6:00 am. Compared with the rats in propofol group, which had prolonged SWS time and increased sleep episodes during 18:00-24:00 and sleep-wake transitions, the CBD-treated rats exhibited a significant reduction of SWS time and fewer SWS-to-active-awake transitions with increased SWS aspects and sleep-wake transitions at night (24:00-08:00). Diazepam treatment produced similar effect to CBD but with a weaker effect on sleep-wake transitions. Propofol caused significant changes in protein expressions and redox state, which were effectively reversed by CBD treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CBD can improve sleep structure and circadian rhythm in rats with propofol-induced sleep disorder possibly by regulating hypothalamic expressions of the key circadian clock proteins, suggesting a new treatment option for perioperative sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) exerts diverse metabolic effects, yet its influence on intestinal lipid metabolism remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we investigated whether short-term (one-week) CBD treatment affects lipid absorption and transport through the lymphatic system using a validated lymph fistula model. Results: CBD treatment significantly enhanced the transport of radiolabeled triglycerides through the lymphatic system. This effect appeared specific, as CBD did not substantially alter cholesterol output in the lymph. Chemical assays indicated that CBD treatment did not significantly alter total triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids, or non-esterified fatty acid levels in the lymph. However, it significantly enhanced the lymphatic output of apolipoprotein A4 (ApoA4) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). Additionally, gene expression analysis revealed a downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (Flt1) in the small intestine, leading to increased lymphatic lacteal permeability and altered lipid transport dynamics. Conclusions: These findings indicate that short-term CBD treatment modulates lymphatic lipid composition and apolipoprotein secretion by regulating lymphatic lacteal function, thereby influencing lipid transport and metabolism. This study provides novel insights into CBD's role in facilitating TG-rich lipoprotein transport via the lymphatic system, highlighting its potential therapeutic applications in lipid-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million people globally, with one-third experiencing drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Cannabidiol (CBD) has shown promise in reducing seizure frequency for specific epilepsy syndromes, though data for broader etiologies remain limited. The goal of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of CBD as an adjunct treatment in the reduction of seizure frequency in DRE patients of various etiologies. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with refractory epilepsy who received a CBD as an adjunct treatment at two tertiary care centers. Seizure frequency at the start of CBD treatment and at a minimum follow-up of 3 months was recorded. Epilepsy diagnosis was categorized into five groups: Focal/Multifocal Epilepsy, Primary Generalized Epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, Dravet Syndrome, and Other Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies. RESULTS: Among all patients, 49 % achieved a ≤ 25 % reduction in seizures, while 5 % had a 26-50 % reduction, 21 % reached a 51-75 % reduction, 20 % experienced a 76-99 % reduction, and 5 % achieved near seizure freedom. There was a significant reduction in median seizure frequency from 30 at baseline to 8 post-treatment (p = 0.000). Significant reductions in seizure frequency were also observed within each diagnostic category. DISCUSSION: CBD has proven to be an effective adjunctive treatment for medically refractory epilepsy, showing significant efficacy across various epilepsy etiologies and genetic backgrounds. Its ability to reduce seizure frequency and the burden of anti-seizure medications (ASMs), especially in syndromes that are traditionally difficult to manage, highlights its value as an additional therapeutic option."

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) holds promise for managing metabolic diseases, yet enhancing its oral bioavailability and efficacy remains challenging. To address this, we developed polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), encapsulating CBD using nanoprecipitation, aiming to create an effective CBD-nanoformulation for metabolic disorder treatment. These NPs (135-265 nm) demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency (EE% ≈ 100%) and sustained release kinetics. Their therapeutic potential was evaluated in an in vitro metabolic syndrome model employing sodium palmitate-induced HepG2 cells. Key assessment parameters included cell viability (MTT assay), glucose uptake, lipid accumulation (Oil Red O staining), triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL-c levels, and gene expression of metabolic regulators. Results showed an IC50 of 9.85 μg/mL for free CBD and 11.26 μg/mL for CBD-loaded NPs. CBD-loaded NPs significantly enhanced glucose uptake, reduced lipid content, lowered triglycerides and total cholesterol, and increased HDL-c levels compared to free CBD. Gene analysis indicated reduced gluconeogenesis via downregulation of PPARγ, FOXO-1, PEPCK, and G6Pase and enhanced fatty acid oxidation through CPT-1 upregulation. These findings suggest that CBD-loaded NPs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of metabolic disorders, warranting further in vivo studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, posing significant challenges due to its heterogeneity and the emergence of drug resistance. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound derived from Cannabis sativa, has recently gained attention for its potential therapeutic effects in breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to evaluate the antitumor effects of CBD in breast cancer treatment by synthesizing preclinical and clinical evidence, elucidating its mechanisms of action, and exploring its translational potential. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed across PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, using keywords such as \"Cannabidiol,\" \"CBD,\" \"Breast Cancer,\" \"Therapeutic Agent,\" and \"Antitumor Effects.\" A total of 1,191 articles were initially identified. After duplicate removal and eligibility screening, 34 studies published between 1998 and 2025 were selected, including in vitro, in vivo, and clinical investigations. Studies were assessed based on PRISMA recommendations, considering inclusion criteria such as CBD's impact on apoptosis, cell proliferation, tumor progression, and molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: CBD demonstrated significant anticancer effects, including induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, suppression of metastasis, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, CBD modulates key pathways such as PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and PPARγ and interacts with CB1, CB2, and non-cannabinoid receptors. Preclinical studies showed CBD's efficacy, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), while limited clinical trials highlighted its potential as an adjunct to conventional therapies. CONCLUSION: CBD offers a promising therapeutic approach for breast cancer, especially for aggressive subtypes like TNBC. However, challenges such as variability in study design, lack of standardized protocols, and limited clinical validation hinder its clinical application. Future research should focus on conducting robust clinical trials, identifying predictive biomarkers, and optimizing combinatorial therapies to integrate CBD into personalized cancer treatment strategies.",

This scoping review aimed to map the current evidence on CBD interactions across different drug classes and assess their clinical significance. The study followed the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, utilizing a structured protocol based on the Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework. Five databases were searched, and preclinical and clinical studies on CBD pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions were included, with publications in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Out of 136 studies analyzed, 91.91% were published after 2011, reflecting a sharp rise in interest in this area. A total of 271 interactions were identified, with 203 related to pharmacokinetics, primarily involving metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and 68 linked to pharmacodynamics, including additive effects such as sedation. Among the most relevant findings, CBD was shown to inhibit CYP enzymes like CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, potentially increasing plasma levels of co-administered drugs. However, only 5.15% of studies evaluated the clinical relevance of these interactions, indicating a substantial gap in knowledge regarding their safety implications. This review highlights the urgent need for rigorous clinical research to determine the clinical significance of CBD-drug interactions, particularly in patients undergoing polypharmacy. Understanding these interactions is crucial for optimizing therapeutic outcomes, minimizing adverse effects, and enabling safer clinical use of CBD in diverse treatment regimens."

OBJECTIVE: to assess the effects of cannabis derivatives for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. SEARCH METHODS: a search of the literature was carried out in the several databases, as well as a manual search of the reference lists of relevant studies, gray literature and clinical trial registries. Selection criteria and analysis: randomized controlled trials were included, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Seven randomized clinical trials were included. Cannabidiol 20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day probably increased the frequency of participants who achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in monthly seizures (20 mg/kg/day: Relative Risk [RR] 1.92; 95 % 95 %CI 1.49-2.46, n = 575, 4 RCTs; 10 mg/kg/day: RR 1.94; 95 %CI 1.32-2.86, n = 280, 2 RCTs, moderate certainty of evidence). The incidence of serious adverse events is probably increased with CBD 20 mg/kg/day (RR 2.30; 95 %CI 1.36-3.89, n = 583, 4 RCTs, moderate certainty of evidence), and may be increased with CBD 10 mg/kg/day (RR 1.62; 95 %CI 0.92-2.84, n = 272, 2 RCTs; low certainty of evidence). Certainty of evidence for other included interventions ranged from very low to low. Conclusions: For most included comparisons and outcomes, there were uncertainties regarding the effects of cannabinoids. Future RCTs could contribute to a better understanding of the effects of cannabinoids for refractory epilepsy."

For HPLC, diluted CBD oil was used, UV spectra were obtained in the range of 4000-650 cm - 1 with a resolution of 4 cm - 1, and for thermal profile determination, CBD oil and the gel were heated from 20 to 300 °C. To evaluate the effects on bovine dental enamel, 40 specimens were distributed into 4 groups (n = 10): control-untreated; HP35%-bleaching with HP35%; KF2-5% potassium nitrate and 2% sodium fluoride + HP35%; CBD-CBD gel + HP35%. The bleaching treatment was performed in 3 sessions with a 72 h interval. Desensitizers were applied for 10 min prior to bleaching. Results were evaluated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey test (p < 0.05). Analyses demonstrated a satisfactory profile for the use of CBD gel. All treated groups showed significant bleaching effect, and there was no difference among them regarding ∆E00, Ra, and KHN. The experimental CBD gel proved to be safe when used prior to the bleaching agent, as it did not influence the effectiveness of bleaching, surface roughness, microhardness, and mineral content of bovine dental enamel."

This systematic review evaluates the potential efficacy and safety of CBD-rich formulations in managing ASD symptoms. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library identified seven studies encompassing 494 patients from Brazil and Israel. Preliminary findings suggest that CBD-rich formulations may provide modest benefits for sleep and social interaction, with a reduction in anxiety symptoms. Regarding core ASD symptoms and behavioral outcomes, cannabinoids demonstrated greater efficacy compared to placebo in some studies. However, adverse events varied, and response to treatment was inconsistent across individuals. While cannabinoids, particularly CBD-rich formulations, appear to be relatively safe and potentially beneficial, further large-scale, controlled trials comparing CBD to established ASD treatments are essential to clarify its role and long-term impact in ASD management."

We conducted a phase Ib/II double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot trial in participants with ET to investigate tolerability, safety, and efficacy of Tilray TN-CT120 LM, an oral pharmaceutical-grade formulation containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 5 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 100 mg. Our objectives were to determine if short-term THC/CBD exposure improved tremor amplitude and was tolerated. METHODS: Participants with ET were randomized (1:1) to receive either TN-CT120 LM or placebo. Dose titration, driven by tolerability, was attempted every 2-3 days to three capsules daily maximum. Participants remained on the highest tolerated dose for two weeks before returning to complete assessments. After completing the first arm, participants titrated off the agent, underwent a three-week washout, and then returned for the same procedures with the alternate compound. The primary endpoint was tremor amplitude change from baseline using digital spiral assessment. Secondary endpoints explored safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Among thirteen participants screened, seven were eligible and enrolled. Five completed all visits; one withdrew following a serious adverse event, and another did not tolerate the lowest dose. Intent-to-treat analyses performed for six participants did not reveal significant effects on primary or secondary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial did not detect any signals of efficacy of THC/CBD in ET. Although preliminary due to the small sample size, our data do not support anecdotal reports of cannabinoid effectiveness for ET. HIGHLIGHTS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy and tolerability pilot trial did not detect any signals of efficacy of oral cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol in reducing essential tremor amplitude using either digital outcome measures or clinical rating scales. The oral cannabinoids were well-tolerated by most (five out of seven) participants.",

Six CBD-THC hydrogel formulations were prepared and evaluated. The hydrodynamic particle sizes were 302.0-545.1 nm and the zeta potentials were from -58.80 to -33.63 mV. The hydrogel pHs were 6.43-6.54. The hydrogel formulations were non-toxic for both CBD (<25 µg/mL) and THC (<12.5 µg/mL). It was observed that high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid in hydrogel affected collagen production. Hydrogel formulations at 2 µg/mL of CBD and 1 µg/mL of THC induced human dermal lymphatic endothelial cell tube formation. CBD-THC hydrogel formulations showed a notable ability to induce angiogenesis, which suggested its potential effectiveness in promoting new lymphatic vessel formation.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting voluntary muscle movement as well as cognitive and other behavioural domains at later disease stages. No effective treatment for ALS is currently available. Elevated neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and alterations to the endocannabinoid system are evident in ALS. The phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Thus, we evaluated the remedial effects of chronic oral cannabidiol (CBD) treatment on ALS-relevant behavioural domains in the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mouse model of ALS that carries a G93A mutation (SOD1G93A). METHODS: Male and female SOD1G93A and wild type-like (WT) littermates were fed either a control (CHOW) or CBD-enriched chow diet (equivalent to a dose of 36 mg/kg per day) beginning from 10 weeks of age. Bodyweight and motor performance were recorded weekly from 11 to 19 weeks and open field behaviours at 12 and 18 weeks. Mice were also tested for prepulse inhibition (PPI), social behaviours, as well as fear-associated memory. RESULTS: CBD treatment ameliorated the bodyweight loss in female SOD1G93A mice, tended to reinstate sociability in SOD1G93A males, strengthened social recognition memory in SOD1G93A females, and improved the PPI response in younger SOD1G93A females at higher prepulse intensities. CBD had no effect on motor impairments but instead reversed the anxiolytic-like phenotype of 12-week-old male SOD1G93A mice and decreased the acoustic startle response and strengthened cue freezing in male mice. CONCLUSION: Thus, the current remedial oral dose of CBD delayed disease progression (inferred by bodyweight) in both male and female mice and improve specific cognitive deficits of SOD1G93A mice in a sex specific manner without altering the motor phenotype."

      "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) nutrition and germplasm of clones can influence biomass and cannabinoid concentration in medicinal cannabis. However, there are discrepancies on the optimal nitrogen (N) application rate at the flowering stage to achieve maximum yield and if, or how, this interacts with clones from different seed lines of the same genotype. This research examined the relationship between N application rate, concentration of cannabinoids and biomass yield of a CBD-type medicinal cannabis cultivar in clones propagated from five different seed lines (hereafter referred to as clones). Clonal rooted cuttings were propagated from five mother plants germinated from seeds of cultivar 'Tas1'. Five N levels (30, 90, 160, 240 and 400 mg/L N) were imposed at the start of the inflorescence period and continued until harvest eight weeks later. Some pollen contamination occurred during the trial so that seed biomass was assessed for each plant and included in statistical analysis. Weight of total biomass, leaves and inflorescence (from upper and lower canopy positions), N%, and cannabinoid concentrations were measured after the harvest. Results indicated that increasing N supply generated a clear upward trend in inflorescence biomass that peaked at 160 mg/L N after which it did not significantly change, while leaf biomass steadily increased with N. Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) concentrations decreased significantly with increasing N concentration in leaves with a similar, but non-significant, trend for inflorescences. The CBD to THC ratio increased with increased N. Clone source was strongly correlated with cannabinoid concentration, but not leaf, inflorescence or total biomass, across all N treatments. Clones 13 and 27 developed greater cannabinoid concentrations relative to clones 18 and 26 irrespective of N treatment. Pollen contamination induced seed development that comprised up to 5% of inflorescence biomass dry weight but this did not significantly affect whole-plant biomass, N accumulation (N%), or cannabinoid concentration. These findings provide valuable insights for improving cannabinoid yield in this widely cultivated plant species.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although explored in other medical fields, cannabidiol (CBD) use for pain management remains understudied in orthopaedics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of CBD use and perceptions among an orthopaedic population. We hypothesized that most patients would be aware of CBD, that the prevalence of CBD use would at least be comparable with the general population (∼15%), and that the overall perception of CBD use for pain relief would be favorable. METHODS: Five hundred adult orthopaedic patients (♂249/♀247; 4 = undisclosed, 54 ± 16 years, 18-86 years) seeking treatment for a wide range of conditions were recruited from a single hospital system before undergoing surgery. Patients were sent an email with a REDCap link for an anonymous survey that included questions about the following: demographics, procedure type, current pain levels, previous knowledge of and/or use of CBD, and indication of favorability regarding CBD use for pain management. RESULTS: Among all patients, >80% reported having heard of CBD and 41.8% reported having used CBD. Among patients reporting previous CBD use, \"pain management\" (79.43%) and \"seeking alternative pain treatment\" (58.81%) were the most common reasons. Among patients reporting no use, the most common reasons were \"unsure of how to obtain\" (42.76%) or \"lack of familiarity\" (37.24%); although the same patients indicated they would consider using if prescription CBD was available (61.22%) along with more evidence regarding safety/efficacy (44.90%). Over 80% of the surveyed patients agreed that CBD might be effective for pain management (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A large proportion of orthopaedic patients have used, or are aware of, CBD for pain management. Presently, barriers to use appear to be most associated with the need for more evidence regarding efficacy/safety and the availability of physician-prescribed pharmaceutical-grade CBD. These results highlight an important need for large-scale randomized trials that may support pharmaceutical-grade CBD use for pain management. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Descriptive Survey Study. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is a pervasive health issue in the United States, affecting up to 50 million adults and contributing to a substantial economic burden. The worsening opioid crisis has increased the need for nonopiate, nonaddictive alternatives to pain management. Cannabidiol (CBD) has recently garnered attention for its potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties without addictive or dependence potential. However, there is limited research regarding the efficacy and safety of CBD in the treatment of chronic pain. This study aimed to explore the use of CBD isolate in adults suffering from chronic pain. METHODS: We decided to investigate its perceived effectiveness, dosage, frequency of use, and reported side effects through a publicly available, completely anonymous Qualtrics survey. This survey was posted online and in multiple medical clinics. RESULTS: The key findings of our anonymous online survey are that the use of cannabinoids is positively associated with decreased chronic pain, even at low dosages (<100 mg). In addition, though some mild side effects are noted, the majority of patients self-report no side effects, and there are no noted severe side effects. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CBD may serve as a promising alternative to conventional pain management strategies. However, the results warrant further investigation and research into the efficacy and safety of CBD for chronic pain. We believe these data point the way for new and continued avenues of research that can better optimize treatment regimens and help patients with chronic pain."

      "abstract": "The use of medicinal cannabis to improve mental health is increasing globally, both in clinical settings and through self-medication. This involves a variety of products containing ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), THC + CBD combinations, or derivatives. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the positive and negative effects of medicinal cannabis on mental health diagnoses and related symptoms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition. Searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (October 2023 and July 2024) identified 18,341 studies, of which 49 controlled studies from 15 different countries were included. All studies focused on treatment-seeking participants using medicinal cannabis for (symptoms of) their mental health diagnosis. Included diagnoses were anxiety disorders, tic disorders, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorders, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, psychosis, substance use disorders, insomnia, and bipolar disorders. Varying product compositions showed different effects. Most consistently, high doses of CBD were followed by some acute relief in anxiety, while CBD + THC combinations alleviated withdrawal in cannabis use disorder and improved sleep. In clinical trials, THC was associated most with dose-dependent adverse events and, in some cases, deterioration of primary study outcomes, e.g., in psychosis. In naturalistic studies, participants who used THC reported symptom improvement following usage. Risks of bias across studies were prevalent, and no study found long-lasting medicinal effects or improvement. Overall, medicinal cannabis may provide short-term relief for certain symptoms but is not a cure or without mental health risks."

ICIs block cancer and T-cell interactions whereas cannabinoids may inhibit T-cell activation, reducing lysis of tumor cells. Interactions between cannabinoid use and dual ICI treatment remain unknown. METHODS: Individual patient data from 4 Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) trials of patients treated with dual ICI ± chemotherapy (n = 684) were pooled. Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel and log-rank tests (stratified by trial/treatment arms) correlated cannabinoid use with clinicopathologic characteristics, Best Overall Response (BOR)/iBOR per RECIST 1.1/iRECIST, Progression-Free Survival (PFS)/iPFS, Overall Survival (OS) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). RESULTS: Sixty-five (9.5%) patients took cannabinoids at any time on trial, 32 (4.7%) of which were using cannabinoids at baseline. By multivariate analysis, cannabinoid use at baseline was significantly associated with improved iPFS (0.05), but not iBOR (p = 0.15), PFS (p = 0.12), OS (p = 0.35) or incidence of grade 1/2 or 3/4 irAEs (p = 0.96 and 0.65 respectively). Results were not significantly different with cannabinoid use at any time on trial. CONCLUSION: Improved iPFS with cannabinoid use in patients treated with durvalumab plus tremelimumab ± chemotherapy did not translate into OS benefits.

Based on its anti-seizure efficacy, the first cannabis derived pharmaceutical grade CBD-based medication was approved in the USA in 2018 for the treatment of seizures in patients 2 years and older. Despite the effectiveness in reducing seizures, there remain several major questions on the optimization of CBD therapy for epilepsy such as the optimal dosage, composition, and route of delivery, which are the main objective of this current study. METHODS: We evaluated the antiseizure effects of CBD through different compositions, routes of delivery, and dosages in a pre-clinical model. We used a kainic acid-induced epilepsy model in C57BL/6 mice, treated them with placebo and/or CBD through inhalation, oral, and injection (intraperitoneal) routes. We used CBD broad spectrum (inhaled and intraperitoneal) vs CBD isolate formulations. We employed the Racine scaling system to evaluate the severity of the seizures, flow cytometry for measuring immune biomarkers and neurotrophic factors, and histologic analysis to examine and compare the groups. RESULTS: Our findings showed that all forms of CBD reduced seizures severity. Among the combination of CBD tested, CBD broad spectrum via inhalation was the most effective in the treatment of epileptic seizures (p < 0.05) compared to other forms of CBD treatments. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that route and CBD formulations affect its efficacy in the prevention of epileptic seizures. Inhaled broad spectrum CBD showed a potential superior effect compared to other delivery routes and CBD formulations in the prevention of epileptic seizures, which warrants further research."

Despite its therapeutic potential, CBD's clinical application could be limited by due to its low bioavailability. This study investigates the efficacy of CBD-loaded niosomes as a neuroprotective formulation for the use in ocular therapies related to retinal ischemia. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of CBD using a nanodispersed system (niosomes) administered via intravitreal injection in rats' eyes. Niosomes underwent characterization for size, distribution, zeta potential, morphology, and encapsulation efficiency. Safety and neuroprotective activity were assessed by electroretinography (ERG), confocal and transmission microscopy and histology. Niosomes exhibited nanometric size (100-400 nm) and stability, showing good tolerance in animals. ERG results demonstrated higher b-wave amplitudes in animals pre-treated with niosomes + CBD compared to the control group following ischemic injury induced by a sudden increase in IOP. Histological and confocal microscopy analyses of retinas from the niosomes + CBD group showed preserved structure compared to the ischemic control group, suggesting significant retinal protection by intravitreally injected niosomes + CBD before ischemia. CBD-loaded niosomes effectively preserved retinal function, highlighting the neuroprotective potential of CBD against retinal ischemia. This formulation presents a promising and innovative treatment for ischemic retinal diseases."

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) was first isolated in the 1940s and its drug structure was established in the 1960s. It has risen significantly in popularity since then and has been observed to reduce inflammation and anxiety in patients. CBD is easy to obtain and consume, therefore, its common use is rising and has spread to use in pets and children. Few studies have focused on the use of CBD as a solution to aggression. In our study, we tested if CBD is effective in reducing aggression in Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) induced by territorial interactions. Betta fish were exposed to controls (water or acetone) and CBD treatments ranging from low, medium, and high (2, 10, and 20 mg CBD/L, respectively), and their behaviors after the visual introduction of an intruder fish were recorded. CBD reduced the odds of aggressive behavior in treated fish. Seventy-five percent of all control fish exhibited aggressive behaviors, while only 17% of CBD-treated fish displayed aggression. Especially, the low CBD dose seemed effective at preventing aggressive behaviors but fish also appeared more lethargic than in any of the other treatments. However, when CBD-treated fish displayed aggressive behaviors, CBD did not appear to reduce the amount of time fish spent being aggressive compared to aggressive fish that did not receive any CBD treatment. While the long-term effects of CBD still have to be examined, our study indicates that CBD might be effective in reducing aggression in Betta fish and potentially other pets."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol (CBD) is an alternative treatment for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). In 2022, the Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires implemented a non-medical change (NMC) of treatment, replacing one commercial pharmaceutical-grade CBD product with another, the latter also being the initial option for new patients. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the commercial product change in this population. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of DRE patients who either switched from one commercial pharmaceutical-grade CBD product to another or started treatment with the new product. The clinical response was evaluated by changes in seizure frequency, perception of change with the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, and safety considering discontinuation and/or the presence of adverse effects. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included, 12 in the change group and 7 in the new start group (7 pediatric and 12 adults). One patient discontinued treatment due to lack of response. Among those who completed follow-up, 8 (44%) reduced seizure frequency, 6 (33%) showed no change, and 4 (22%) increased seizure frequency. According to the PGIC scale, 9 (50%) remained unchanged, 5 (28%) reported barely noticeable changes, and 4 (22%) reported improvement. Adverse events were mild and transient. CONCLUSION: The new commercial pharmaceutical-grade CBD product is a safe and valid option both for substitution and initial treatment in patients with DRE. During the treatment period, patients perceived stability or improvement according to the PGIC scale.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress-induced liver injury, resulting from acute or chronic stress, is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. The endocannabinoid system, particularly cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), plays a crucial role in liver damage. However, there are currently no clinical drugs targeting CB2R for liver diseases. Cannabidiol (CBD), a CB2R agonist, possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study aims to investigate the pharmacological effects of CBD in a mouse model of stress-induced liver injury. METHODS: We employed a mouse model of stress-induced liver injury to evaluate the protective effects of CBD. Assessments included histopathological analysis, cytokine detection via ELISA, protein expression analysis using immunohistochemistry and Western blot, and gene transcription differential analysis. Transmission electron microscopy was utilized to observe mitochondrial morphology. Additionally, we examined the expression levels of CB2R, SLC7A11, α-SMA, and ACSL4 proteins to elucidate the mechanisms underlying CBD's effects. RESULTS: CBD exhibited significant protective effects against stress-induced liver injury in mice. Decreases in liver function indicators (including Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)) and inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)) were observed. CBD enhanced CB2R expression and reduced α-SMA levels, mitigating liver fibrosis. It also decreased ACSL4 levels, increased SOD and GSH-Px activities, and upregulated SLC7A11 protein expression. Furthermore, CBD improved mitochondrial morphology, indicating a reduction in oxidative cell death. CONCLUSION: CBD activates the CB2R/α-SMA pathway to modulate liver inflammation and fibrosis. Through the SLC7A11/ACSL4 signaling pathway, CBD alleviates oxidative stress in stress-induced liver injury, enhances mitochondrial morphology, and reduces liver damage. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the potential application of CBD in the prevention and treatment of stress-induced liver injury."

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is one of the main players in lesion expansion and locomotor deficits after spinal cord injury (SCI), thus treatments to control the inflammatory process emerge as novel therapeutic strategies. In this context, the anti-inflammatory effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the main phytocannabinoids of Cannabis sativa, are increasingly recognized. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of a standardized Cannabis sativa extract (CSE), which is mainly composed by THC/CBD in equimolar concentration, on neuroinflammation, secondary damage and locomotor outcome after SCI in rats. After acute SCI, CSE therapy increased the number of non-inflammatory (arginase-1 positive) microglial cells in the epicenter of the lesion and decreased the number of pro-inflammatory ones (arginase-1 negative) in the epicenter and in the rostral and caudal regions of the lesion. CSE also reduced the number of reactive astrocytes in the grey matter of the rostral and caudal regions. These results are consistent with the downregulation of mRNAs of inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, C3) and the upregulation of anti-inflammatory markers (ARG-1, MRC). In the chronic phase, CSE treatment prevented cyst expansion and also increased the volume of spared grey and white matter. Regarding locomotor outcome, CSE-treated rats showed better locomotor scores (open field test), higher latency to fall (Rotarod test) and lower number of hindlimb foot misplacements (horizontal ladder walking test) than untreated injured rats. These results suggest that this standardized CSE offers a promising perspective for reducing acute neuroinflammation and promoting functional recovery after SCI.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced pain is one of the major challenges that hamper the patient's quality of life. Several cases of insufficient pain management were reported globally, especially in the case of patients who do not respond well to conventional pain management regimes and opioid analgesics. Additionally, conventional pain management has several shortcomings, and evidence suggests that cannabidiol has the potential to overcome those shortcomings. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive compound of the Cannabis plant that shows an effective outcome in chemotherapy- induced pain as well as in cancer treatment, as it possesses anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The mechanism of pain and its management by cannabidiol, with all possible evidence, is well summarised in the paper. This article concludes the types of pain experienced by cancer patients, the effectiveness of CBD in the management of pain, and challenges faced by patients after using Cannabidiol with various case studies. Later, antitumor efficacy studies of CBD were disclosed, and its various types of formulations and nano-formulations were summarized in the paper. Overall, the paper establishes the role of cannabidiol in Chemotherapy-induced pain."

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep difficulty is common in the current society. Poor sleep has a significant influence on health, social interactions and even mortality; therefore, maintaining good sleep is of prime importance. Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis-derived compound, is known for its medical significance with many positive effects in humans, including decreasing anxiety and improving sleep for those with sleep disorders. Objective: However, whether CBD skin absorption results in similar effects is unknown. Therefore, examining CBD-coated fabric as a pillow cover to improve sleep quality in duty shift nurses is the purpose of this paper. Methods: This study recruited 55 duty shift nurses as participants to evaluate sleep patterns and quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a consumer-grade tracker (Fitbit Charge 3). Data were collected over three phases: a one-week baseline period, a two-week intervention period using a CBD-coated pillow cover and a one-week follow-up period, referred to as the post-intervention phase, during which the use of CBD-coated pillow cover was continued. Results: Of the 55 participants, 10 were men (18.2%) and 45 were women (81.8%). At baseline, all participants exhibited poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 5). However, after three weeks of using CBD-coated pillow covers, subjective sleep quality significantly improved, with 7.3% of participants achieving PSQI scores <5. Additionally, slight changes in sleep patterns were observed, with increases in both light sleep and deep sleep durations. Light sleep duration increased from a baseline of 196.21 ± 65.28 to 206.57 ± 59.15 min two weeks after intervention (p = 0.337). Similarly, deep sleep duration showed a modest increase from 61.97 ± 21.01 min to 64.35 ± 22.19 min (p = 0.288). Furthermore, a significant reduction in anxiety levels was reported (p < 0.005). Conclusions: Using a CBD-coated pillow cover was found to enhance sleep duration in healthy individuals experiencing poor sleep. Consequently, for adults struggling with sleep difficulties, incorporating a CBD-coated pillow cover may serve as an effective aid in improving sleep quality."

      "abstract": "Background:Cannabis sativa L. and its products are becoming popular for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. One of the main phytocannabinoids contained in cannabis is cannabidiol (CBD), which is a component of numerous cosmetic preparations used to treat inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. However, current data regarding the efficacy and safety of CBD for dermatological indications are limited. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of high-CBD Cannabis sativa L. extract (eCBD) in a model of AD. Methods: Dermatitis was induced by repeated application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) to the skin of the rats' ears. The therapeutic effect of eCBD was evaluated in behavioral, histopathological, and hematological studies following topical application as an ointment containing 2% CBD. Results: Application of the ointment containing eCBD resulted in attenuation of DNCB-induced inflammation. Interestingly, an anti-edematous effect was more pronounced in rats treated with the eCBD than in rats treated with 1% hydrocortisone ointment. However, eCBD did not reduce the frequency of DNCB-induced scratching, while there was a visible antipruritic effect of 1% hydrocortisone application. Histopathological analysis revealed that both eCBD and 1% hydrocortisone ointments significantly decreased mast cell count compared with the Vaseline control group. Furthermore, treatment with an ointment containing eCBD resulted in a decrease in the number of leukocytes in the blood. Conclusions: Topically administered eCBD had a stronger anti-edematous effect than glucocorticosteroid and differently affected hematological parameters. It is suggested that eCBD has therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD."

      "abstract": "Background: Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and associated muscles, leading to pain, restricted jaw movement, and impaired quality of life. Conventional treatments, including physical therapy, medications, and surgical interventions, have varying degrees of success and potential side effects. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, has gained attention for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties. This study explores the potential role of CBD in TMD management. Methods: A review of existing literature was conducted (2007-2024), focusing on preclinical and clinical studies assessing the efficacy of CBD in pain modulation, inflammation reduction, and muscle relaxation. Relevant studies were sourced from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Additionally, potential mechanisms of action, including interactions with the endocannabinoid system, were analyzed. Results: Studies suggest that CBD exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by modulating CB1 and CB2 receptors, reducing cytokine release, and influencing neurotransmitter pathways. Preliminary clinical evidence indicates that CBD may alleviate TMD-related pain and muscle tension with minimal adverse effects. However, high-quality randomized controlled trials are limited. Conclusions: CBD demonstrates promise as a potential adjunctive treatment for TMD. Further research, including well-designed clinical trials, is necessary to establish its efficacy, optimal dosage, and long-term safety."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is associated with a wide range of debilitating symptoms, and conventional therapies often fail to adequately address the disease's multifaceted challenges. Cannabidiol (CBD) 13.0% + Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 9.0% (CBD13/THC9), a vaporized cannabis-based medicinal product, presents a novel therapeutic option for managing MS symptoms. Methods: This single-center longitudinal study followed 69 MS patients over a six-month period. Participants were assessed at treatment initiation and at three- and six-month intervals. Key measures included muscle spasticity, urine bladder dysfunction, and the evaluation of disability progression rate. The evaluation included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the Post Void Residual (PVR) volume, and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results: Significant improvement was observed across all outcome assessments. The EDSS score was decreased over time (p = 0.009), indicating a slight reduction in disability progression rate, while MAS scores showed substantial improvement in muscle spasticity (p < 0.001). Urine bladder function improved significantly, with PVR volume showing notable improvement between baseline and the six-month assessment (p < 0.001). Correlation analyses revealed that a gradual increase in vaporized CBD13/THC9 dose was correlated with slightly lower EDSS scores, while the adverse effects were negatively associated with the frequency of cannabinoid use. Finally, patients who were smokers used CBD13/THC9 more frequently. Conclusions: The vaporized CBD13/THC9 formulation demonstrated notable efficacy in slightly improving disability progression rate via reduction in muscle spasticity and urine bladder dysfunction in MS patients. This highlights its addon therapeutic value during rehabilitation in MS patients with debilitating disability symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SCZ) has limited treatment options, often with significant side effects. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-euphoric phytocannabinoid, has shown potential as a novel therapeutic option in SCZ due to antipsychotic-like, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. We compared the therapeutic effects of CBD and risperidone (RISP) in a rat model of SCZ induced by sub-chronic ketamine (KET), focusing on inflammatory and oxidative stress, and behavioral phenotypes. METHODS: Rats were pre-treated with KET or saline (SAL) for 10 days followed by CBD or RISP for 8 days. Locomotion, anxiety- and anhedonia-like behavior, and recognition memory were assessed. Oxidative damage as measured by protein carbonyls, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and catalase activity, and the inflammation markers myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and nitrite/nitrate (N/N) concentration ratio were assessed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hypothalamus (HYP), hippocampus (HPC), and striatum, brain areas relevant to SCZ. RESULTS: CBD restored the KET-induced decreased rearing behavior in the OFT, while RISP further decreased rearing. RISP treatment in control rats decreased rearing and elicited an anhedonic-like phenotype, while CBD did not. CBD, but not RISP restored the KET-induced increased levels of MPO activity in the PFC and the striatum, and protein carbonyls in the HPC. Post-KET treatment with RISP but not CBD decreased protein carbonyls in the PFC, and decreased the N/N concentration ratio in the HYP. CONCLUSION: CBD restored the KET-induced decrease in rearing behavior without inducing an anhedonic-like phenotype as observed with RISP. CBD, and to a lesser extent RISP restored the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation elicited by KET in the striatum, HPC, and PFC. These findings support the possibility that the antipsychotic effects of CBD might be mediated by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This real-world, retrospective, multicenter study aims to investigate the effectiveness of highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) in a large cohort of patients with epilepsy of genetic etiology due to an identified monogenic cause. Additionally, we examine the potential relationship between specific genetic subgroups and treatment response. METHODS: This study was conducted across 27 epilepsy centers and included patients with monogenic epileptic disorders (pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants) who were treated with highly purified CBD for at least 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 266 patients (135 females, 50.8%) with monogenic epilepsies were included with a median age at CBD initiation of 12 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 7-19) and a median follow-up duration of 17 months (IQR = 12-24). Overall, 77 different monogenic epilepsies have been included, with the most common genes being SCN1A (32.3%), TSC2 (13.5%), CDKL5, and MECP2 (4.5% each). The mean seizure reduction at the last follow-up was 38.6%, with 47.5% of patients achieving ≥50% seizure reduction and 7.4% achieving seizure freedom. The Clinical Global Impression scale indicated improvement in 65.8% of patients. The general linear mixed model revealed that a shorter maximum duration of seizure freedom before CBD initiation and a higher degree of intellectual disability were independently associated with lower CBD effectiveness. Conversely, no significant differences in seizure outcome were observed across different epilepsy syndromes (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex epilepsy, and other developmental and epileptic encephalopathy), between approved indications and off-label use, or between concomitant clobazam use or not. SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports CBD as a potential treatment for monogenic epilepsies beyond its licensed indications, demonstrating comparable effectiveness between approved and off-label use and suggesting genetic subgroups with promising treatment responses."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A growing number of publications are devoted to topical cannabinoid therapies in present-day cosmetology, as they appear to be safe and effective treatment modalities aimed at improving the comfort and quality of life of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). A thorough patient interview, physical examination, clinical picture, and aetiopathogenesis of AD allow for a correct diagnosis and enable the choice of the least invasive pharmacological treatment. PURPOSE: In our medical experiment, we found a correlation between the findings of studies by other authors and the validation of our hypothesis that topical cannabinoid therapy is effective in the prevention and management of AD flares. A thorough analysis of the obtained results provided insights into the extent to which the applied ointment influenced the improvement of the skin's biophysical parameters (hydration, lipid content, transepidermal water loss, and erythema). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This medical experimental study was conducted from May to July 2022 and included a group of nine patients (five men and four women) aged 20- to 67-years-old were diagnosed with AD. The study involved transdermal delivery of an ointment compounded with cholesterol ointment, 30% cannabidiol (CBD), 5% cannabigerol (CBG), and hemp seed oil, and assessment of biophysical skin parameters, including corneometry (skin hydration), TEWL, sebumetry, and pH (acidity). RESULTS: A preliminary analysis of our pilot study points to the potential of employing ointments and creams containing 30% CBD and 5% CBG as alternatives to conventional auxiliary therapies during both flare-ups and remission. The results we achieved included improved skin hydration, sebum level, and TEWL as well as reduced erythema in the studied areas (forearms). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that topical cannabinoid therapy is effective in reducing itching and improving the quality of life of patients with AD, leading to symptom remission in some cases."

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids relieve pain, nausea, anorexia and anxiety, and improve quality of life in several cancer patients. The immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), although very successful in a subset of patients, is accompanied by moderate to severe immune-related adverse events (ir-AE) that often necessitate its discontinuation. Because of their role in symptomatic relief, cannabinoids have been used in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy. A few studies strongly suggest that the use of medicinal cannabis in cancer patients attenuates many of the ir-AE associated with the use of ICI immunotherapy and increase its tolerability. However, no significant beneficial effects on overall survival, progression free survival or cancer relapses were observed; rather, some of the studies noted adverse effects of concurrent administration of cannabinoids with ICI immunotherapy on the clinical benefits of the latter. Because of cannabinoids' well documented immunosuppressive effects mediated through the cannabinoid recptor-2 (CB2), we propose considering this receptor as an inhibitory immune checkpoint per se. A simultaneous neutralization of CB2, concurrent with cannabinoid treatment, may lead to better clinical outcomes in cancer patients receiving ICI immunotherapy. In this regard, cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG), with little agonism for CB2, may be better therapeutic choices. Additional strategies e.g., the use of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitors that degrade some endocannabinoids as well as lipogenesis and formation of lipid bilayers in cancer cells may also be explored. Future studies should take into consideration gut microbiota, CYP450 polymorphism and haplotypes, cannabinoid-drug interactions as well as genetic and somatic variations occurring in the cannabinoid receptors and their signaling pathways in cancer cells for personalized cannabis-based therapies in cancer patients receiving ICIs. This may lead to rational knowledge-based regimens tailored to individual cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Hypercaloric diet (HCD) intake can lead to metabolic alterations, such as metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) is a GPR55 receptor antagonist involved in insulin secretion and other functions in pancreatic islet. The therapeutic use of CBD has been suggested for diabetes, but little is known regarding its effects on pancreatic islet physiology. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of CBD oil on pancreatic islets, from Wistar rats under HCD. Male rats were divided in 4 groups: Normal diet vehicle-treated (control) and CBD-treated group. Rats under HCD were subdivided in treated with vehicle (HCD) and with CBD oil administered 21 mg/Kg orally, 0.5 ml in 3 days per week; controls received coconut oil as vehicle. Body weight, food intake, and water consumption were recorded. After 20 weeks, glucose tolerance curve was performed; serum insulin was determined by ELISA, and pancreas was removed for histological and gene expression analysis for insulin, glucagon, PDX-1, MafA and GPR55 receptor. CBD treatment reduced body weight and food intake but increased fluid consumption, independently of diets. In control group, CBD did not alter blood glucose and serum insulin, but modified expression for GPR55 receptor, glucagon, insulin and MafA. Rats under HCD and treated with CBD decreased glycaemia, insulinaemia, islets relative area, GPR55-positive cells, PDX-1 and MafA gene expression, meanwhile insulin and glucagon expression was increased. In conclusion, CBD ameliorated HCD effects through changes in insulin, glucagon and GPR55 receptor expressions. We assume CBD interacts with other receptors beside GPR55.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabis as a therapeutic agent is accessible to a growing number of people, though research suggests that many medical cannabis (MC) users undertake their cannabinoid therapy independently, without collaborating with a cannabis clinician or informing their primary care provider (PCP). The effects of medical collaboration or disclosure to PCP on outcomes of cannabinoid therapy are unknown. Researchers anticipate that those who collaborate with a cannabis clinician or disclose their medical cannabis use to their PCP will find MC to be more effective, use less delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and more cannabidiol (CBD), and experience fewer side effects. METHODS: Through an online survey, medical cannabis users reported their cannabis usage patterns, health outcomes, PCP awareness, and collaboration with cannabis clinicians. These responses were analyzed using a variety of statistical tests to search for differences in reported efficacy, specific cannabinoid, and side effects between different levels of medical professional involvement (n = 988). RESULTS: Patients who either worked with a cannabis clinician or reported their use of their PCP reported significantly higher efficacy (p < 0.001), and in the case of working specifically with a cannabis clinician, higher daily doses of cannabidiol were used (p < 0.001). CBD doses did not vary between those who had disclosed their MC use to their PCP and those who had not. There were no significant differences in THC doses or side effects identified between groups. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that undertaking cannabinoid therapy with PCP awareness or guidance from a cannabis clinician is associated with better outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene. In addition to global developmental delay (GDD)/intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), PMS is characterized by multiple neurologic, behavioral and multisystemic manifestations. METHODS: We aimed to establish a database of individuals with PMS in Israel. All participants underwent a detailed evaluation at a single medical center, and demographic, clinical, and genetic data were collected. RESULTS: Seventeen unrelated individuals with PMS (mean age 10 ± 8.2 years; range, 2.5-36 years) were enrolled (10 females, 59%), all of Jewish descent. Twelve cases (70%) were caused by deletions in chromosomal region 22q13.3, including mosaicism, ring chromosome and unbalanced translocation. The other 5 (30%) cases were due to single nucleotide variants (SNVs), while the de novo SNV c.3904dup (p.Ala1302GlyfsTer69), recurred in 3 cases. All 17 participants had GDD/ID (which was severe in 10, 59%), and ASD and seizures were present in 12 (70%) and 8 (47%) individuals, respectively. Additional frequent manifestations were sleep difficulties in 13 individuals (76%), bowel movement disorders in 13 (76%), urinary track involvement in 8 (47%) and endocrine disorders in 6 (35%). Abnormal but nonspecific findings on prenatal ultrasonography were noted in 3 participants (18%). The most common perinatal complication was prolonged jaundice in 5 infants (29%). Different medical treatment modalities, including cannabidiol (CBD) full-spectrum oil extracts, were used to ease symptoms, with variable results. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience adds to current knowledge about clinical manifestations and potential symptomatic treatment of PMS in Israel. These findings may promote clinical research and serve as infrastructure for future clinical trials.",

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, has shown potential in modulating neural processes associated with substance use disorders including AUD. This study aimed to investigate the effect of CBD on alcohol cue-induced activation of neurocircuitry associated with alcohol craving, and impact on mood, craving, and cognitive functioning in individuals with AUD. In a cross-over, double-blind, randomized trial, 22 non-treatment seeking individuals (M = 29 years) diagnosed with AUD (DSM-V) received either 800 mg of CBD or a matched placebo, completing two respective fMRI sessions. The primary outcome was neural activation in response to alcohol versus control visual cues, measured using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) alcohol cue reactivity task. Secondary outcomes included assessments of mood, craving, and cognitive functioning. Region of interest analyses showed no differences in alcohol cue-elicited activation between the CBD and placebo conditions. However, exploratory whole-brain analysis indicated a significant treatment effect of CBD in the precuneus which was independent of cue specificity. There were no significant treatment effects of CBD compared to placebo on acute craving, mood, or cognitive functioning. In non treatment seeking individuals with AUD, CBD modulates precuneus activity during alcohol cue exposure. Further studies examining the effect of CBD on treatment-seeking AUD individuals are warranted."

      "abstract": "Reactive astrocytes play a critical role in the initiation and progression of epilepsy, but their molecular subtypes and functional characterization are not fully understood. In this study, we report the existence of neurotoxic reactive astrocytes, a recently identified subtype, that contribute to neuronal death in the epileptic brain. In a kainic acid (KA)-induced mouse model of epilepsy, we show that neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are induced by microglia-secreted cytokines, including IL-1α, TNFα, and C1q, and are detectable as early as 7 days post-KA stimulation. These cells exhibit a distinct molecular signature marked by elevated expression of complement 3 and adenosine 2A receptor. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of human brain tissues from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and an epileptic mouse model reveal that neurotoxic reactive astrocytes induce neuronal damage through lipid-related mechanisms. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the anti-seizure medication cannabidiol (CBD) and an adenosine 2A receptor antagonist can both suppress the formation of neurotoxic reactive astrocytes, mitigate gliosis, and reduce neuronal loss in a mouse model of epilepsy. Electrophysiological and behavioral studies indicate that cannabidiol attenuates seizure symptoms and enhances memory capabilities in epileptic mice. Our findings suggest that neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are formed at an early stage in both the KA-induced mouse model of epilepsy and TLE patients and can contribute to neuronal loss through releasing toxic lipids. Importantly, cannabidiol emerges as a promising therapeutic drug for targeted intervention against neurotoxic reactive astrocytes in adult epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Plaque-associated gingivitis is widely regarded as a local inflammatory condition initiated by the accumulation of a non-specific dental biofilm in the interaction with the host immune system. The initial symptom noticed by the patient is bleeding gums. The use of mouthwash can serve to supplement mechanotherapy. However, there is an increasing interest in mouthwashes comprising natural ingredients, including cannabidiol (CBD) and spilanthol. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an oral rinse containing spilanthol and CBD oil compared to a rinse containing tea tree oil on the oral microbiota and the values of selected oral status indicators in patients with gingivitis. Methods: The study included 40 patients treated with a rinse containing tea tree oil (TTO)/TTO + spilanthol + CBD for a period of 42 days. Patients rinsed their mouth twice daily for 30 s. The patients' oral microbiome was assessed before and after treatment, and bleeding on probing (BOP) and approximal plaque index (API) were assessed. The study was double-blind. Results: API and BOP were reduced in all groups, both the test and control. The most significant decrease in baseline BOP-1 scores was observed in test groups A and D (p = 0.005062 and p = 0.005062, respectively). A significant difference in API improvement was observed between the initial and final visits in the test (A, D) and control (B, C) groups (p = 0.012516, p = 0.005062, p = 0.004028, p = 0.003172, respectively). Conclusions: Firstly, the use of a mouthwash containing cannabidiol (CBD) and spilanthol was demonstrated to be efficacious in the maintenance of oral microbiota homeostasis. Secondly, the combination of TTO with spilanthol and CBD in the rinse was shown to result in a more significant reduction in selected oral health parameters (BOP and API) and anti-inflammatory effects when compared to a rinse with TTO alone. It should be noted that this is a pilot study and will continue."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are rare and debilitating forms of epilepsy, characterised by recurrent, severe, drug-resistant seizures and neurodevelopmental impairments. A non-euphoric, plant-derived, highly purified formulation of cannabidiol (CBD; Epidyolex®, 100 mg/mL oral solution) is approved in the European Union and United Kingdom for use in patients aged ≥2 years for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS or DS in conjunction with clobazam (CLB), and for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in patients aged ≥2 years. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies who were treated with adjunctive CBD at six epilepsy centres in Germany. We analysed patient and treatment characteristics, seizure outcomes, treatment retention rates (i.e. the proportion of patients remaining on CBD treatment at time of assessment and retention as estimated by Kaplan-Meier [KM] analyses), physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), and adverse events (AEs) for up to 12 months. Here, we report data from this chart review for those patients with LGS or DS receiving adjunctive treatment with concomitant CBD and CLB. RESULTS: We identified 126 patients (102 LGS; 24 DS) receiving CBD and CLB, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 23.2 (15.8) years and a mean (SD) age of epilepsy onset of 3 (3.7) years. Patients had received a median (range) number of prior antiseizure medications (ASMs) of 6 (1-24) and concomitant ASMs of 3 (1-7). The median target CBD dose was 11.1 mg/kg/day in the total population (17.8, 15.8, and 9.7 mg/kg/day in the <6 years, 6-17 years, and ≥18 years subgroups, respectively). The median time to the target dose was 21-22 days across age groups. The median concomitant CLB dose was 0.14 mg/kg/day (0.38, 0.22, and 0.10 mg/kg/day in the respective age groups). A ≥50% reduction in total seizures was observed in 47.5% of patients at 3 months (35.7-52.6% across age groups) and 45.5% of patients at 12 months (44.4-46.2% across age groups). For generalised tonic-clonic seizures, a ≥50% reduction was observed in 63.0% of patients at 3 months (60.7-66.7% across age groups) and 56.9% of patients at 12 months (50.0-75.0% across age groups). Median seizure days per month significantly decreased from 30 (range: 0.5-30) at baseline to 15 (range: 0-30) at the last follow-up (p <0.001). Overall, 89.7%, 80.7%, and 69.8% patients remained on CBD at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. KM estimated treatment retention was similar across paediatric and adult groups, according to earlier or later initiation (e.g. ≤4 vs ≥15 prior and concomitant ASMs) and according to the syndrome (LGS and DS). Physicians rated 66% of patients demonstrated a CGI-C improvement and 67% demonstrated a CGI-C behaviour improvement. The most common AEs (≥5%) were sedation (n = 30, 23.8%), diarrhoea (n = 13, 10.3%) and psycho-behavioural AEs (n = 9, 7.1%). CONCLUSION: In this chart review of patients with severe treatment refractory LGS or DS receiving adjunctive CBD and CLB concomitantly, a reduction in seizure frequency and sustained treatment retention was observed for up to 12 months across age groups in real-world clinical practice. CBD discontinuations exclusively due to AEs were infrequent and the AE profile was generally aligned to that previously observed.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly, the cannabis sativa plant compound cannabidiol (CBD) is used to treat various psychiatric and neurological health conditions which occur in early life or adolescence, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. However, behavioural effects CBD during adolescence have received limited attention, and the long-lasting behavioural consequences of adolescent CBD treatment are unknown. Thus, this study investigated the effects of chronic CBD in adolescence on behaviours in adulthood, in a mouse model of susceptibility to cannabinoid drugs and schizophrenia, i.e. Neuregulin 1 transmembrane domain heterozygous (Nrg1 TM HET) and wildtype-like (WT) controls. We also assessed if adolescent CBD may affect behavioural responses to acute low dose Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in adulthood. Male Nrg1 TM HET mice and WT controls were administered 30 mg/kg CBD daily intraperitoneally for 3 weeks in adolescence, and then at 5-6 months of age were tested for locomotion, social behaviour, sensorimotor gating and cognition, as well as sensitivity to acute THC-induced behaviours. Adolescent CBD supressed locomotion, exploration, and social behaviours, and reduced anxiety-like behaviours in adult mice. An acute THC challenge in adulthood suppressed social behaviours and acoustic startle in all mice, and adolescent CBD exacerbated THC-induced suppression of acoustic startle in Nrg1 mutant mice. CBD did not alter schizophrenia-relevant behaviours in Nrg1 TM HET mice. To conclude, adolescent CBD exposure had persistent effects on behavioural domains in adulthood including anxiety, locomotion and social behaviours. Furthermore, CBD exposure early in life affected behavioural responses to acute THC in the presence of a risk gene which enhances cannabinoid sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the use of D-limonene and some vegetable oils with different amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as alternative green solvents for microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.). A standardized cannabis extract was selected to evaluate its potential as a chemopreventive agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alternative green solvents, powder-to-solvent ratios, and irradiation cycles were determined to optimize the MAE conditions. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed to assess the cytotoxic effects against human breast cancer (MCF-7), liver cancer (HepG2), and mammary epithelium (hTert-HME1) cell lines. RESULTS: The extracts obtained from D-limonene and palm oil contained the highest concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD) and D-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A standardized D-limonene extract of cannabis (DEC) containing 0.03% w/w CBD and 1.37% w/w THC was selected for the evaluation of cytotoxic activity compared with CBD and THC. The results revealed that CBD and THC exhibited significant cytotoxic effects (p<0.05) against MCF-7 and HepG2, with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 18.5 and 12.37 μg/mL for CBD and 24.21 and 4.30 μg/mL for THC, respectively, whereas DEC exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against MCF-7 (IC50 of 488.85 μg/mL). However, CBD and THC exhibited significant cytotoxicity (p<0.05) against hTert-HME1 (IC50 values of 35.61 and 25.63 μg/mL, respectively), whereas DEC exhibited low cytotoxicity against hTert-HME1 (IC50 of 1.537.03 μg/mL). CONCLUSION: DECs containing appropriate levels of THC and CBD have the potential to be candidates for cancer treatment. However, further investigations are required to improve the efficacy and safety profiles."

      "abstract": "White-Sutton syndrome (WSS), associated with POGZ gene mutations, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a spectrum of phenotypic features, including intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and epilepsy. A case report described a female patient diagnosed with WSS who experienced seizures resistant to conventional antiseizure medications. Despite various therapeutic attempts, including valproate, topiramate, levetiracetam, clobazam, rufinamide, and vigabatrin, the patient's seizures persisted. After initiating an off-label treatment with cannabidiol (CBD), the patient achieved complete remission from seizures. Following significant clinical improvement, CBD therapy was discontinued by the parents against medical advice, leading to seizure recurrence. Upon reinstatement of CBD, the patient once again experienced successful seizure control. This report emphasizes the need for further investigation into the off-label use of CBD, as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy associated with WSS. Although CBD shows promise in other epileptic syndromes, this case highlights its potential effectiveness in this specific condition. This manuscript aims to contribute to the understanding of WSS and advocate for further research into novel treatments, particularly the role of CBD in managing epilepsy within this complex clinical context."

      "abstract": "Brain excitability is dysfunctional in epilepsy and overlapping neuropsychiatric conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Epilepsy and ASD are often attributed to malfunctioning coordination between synaptic excitation and inhibition. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe form of epilepsy arising from haploinsufficiency of the SCN1A gene that encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1. A DS mouse model (Scn1a+/-) recapitulated essential features of DS and revealed that sodium current density was profoundly reduced in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons while pyramidal cells were spared, suggesting that DS is an \"interneuronopathy.\" Further studies from the Catterall group and others have expanded this picture: DS symptoms, which include recurrent seizures, ataxia, cognitive impairment, ASD, and premature death, could be assigned in part to brain region-specific effects; the Nav1.1 mutations cause dysfunction in some subtypes of interneurons, not others, and are temporally restricted; DS-causing sodium channel mutations were found throughout SCN1A as well as in SCN1B, encoding the β1 subunit. Interest in therapeutic approaches was sparked by preclinical studies of cannabidiol (CBD) that led to the 2018 US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of seizures in patients with DS. Independent evidence showed that CBD antagonized GPR55, a G protein-coupled receptor activated by the lipid signaling molecule lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). We summarized evidence from our group and others that CBD has a dual mechanism of action, targeting both ion channels and GPR55. CBD quells an epileptogenic vicious cycle: seizures strengthen LPI-GPR55 signaling while LPI-GPR55 signaling elevates the synaptic excitatory-inhibitory ratio, thereby promoting further seizures. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Modern medicine relies on ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as key targets. In studies of Dravet syndrome, a devastating genetic disorder with features of epilepsy and autism, William Catterall connected NaV1.1 mutations to deficient excitability of inhibitory neurons. He and his colleagues explored preclinical interventions using cannabidiol (CBD) and clobazam, opening the way to a current understanding of CBD's therapeutic mechanism. CBD affects both ion channels and GPR55, a GPCR activated by lysophosphatidylinositol, an activity-dependent lipid messenger, readjusting the synaptic excitatory-inhibitory ratio.",

      "abstract": "Pain management in horses plays a pivotal role in the therapeutic approach to several diseases. Horses have cannabinoid receptors at the level of dorsal root ganglia, blood vessels, and synoviocytes that can be up or down- regulated by inflammatory conditions, justifying the possible efficacy of exogenous cannabinoids (i.e., phytocannabinoids) in managing several painful pathologies in this animal species. However, the current use of supplements containing cannabidiol (CBD) in equines is based on anecdotal evidence, without the support of sufficient pharmacokinetic studies. In humans, the concentration peak of CBD and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) are both strongly influenced by food administration. Also, in equids, the oral bioavailability of some drugs can be influenced by the meal but no information is available about CBD. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of CBD following single oral administration of two different formulations of pure CBD (oil and paste), dosed at 1 mg/kg, at two different times about food administration. CBD oil and CBD paste were administered orally at 1 mg/kg to eight healthy horses according to a cross over design, and blood samples were taken at pre-fixed time-points for the pharmacokinetic analyses. The obtained pharmacokinetic data did not allow for statistically significant differences between formulations (paste or oil) and feeding time (fed and fasted status). However, following treatment with the paste, the Cmax was achieved in a shorter time range compared to the oily formulation, indicating that it could be a better formulation to consider in future equine studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe encephalopathic disease that leads to a decrease in the quality of life, physical injury, psychosocial impairment, and a significant increase in treatment costs. Cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of tonic-colonic seizures in LGS. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CBD compared to the usual treatment in patients with LGS syndrome. METHODS: We developed a lifetime-horizon Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive CBD versus usual care. Additionally, we performed a budget impact analysis over a 5-year time horizon. The findings were presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CEA, with a willingness to pay threshold of $18,261 per QALY gained, and as the difference in the overall budget ($) between the scenarios with and without CBD for budget impact assessment. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, CBD was cost-effective compared with usual care $6573 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses substantiated these results. From a healthcare perspective, there is a 77% probability that CBD is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $18,261 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Overall, the market access of CBD was associated to an increased budget of about $3,459,846 (+ 33%) in the next 5 years simulated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to usual care, CBD seems to be cost-effective in LGS patients and sustainable, with less than 34% overall budget increased in the next 5 years. Future studies need to confirm our results in the real word setting and in other countries.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many chemotherapy agents used to treat advanced cancer are inherently mucotoxic, causing breakdown of the gastrointestinal mucosa (gastrointestinal mucositis (GI-M)) and lead to a constellation of secondary complications including diarrhoea, malnutrition, anorexia, pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances. These symptoms are usually managed individually, leading to polypharmacy and its associated risks. The endocannabinoid system regulates numerous biological and behavioural processes associated with chemotherapy side effects, suggesting its modulation could control these symptoms. Therefore, the CANnabinoids in CANcer (CANCAN) therapy trial is a phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to determine the efficacy of medicinal cannabis in minimising GI-M and its associated symptom burden. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CANCAN trial is being conducted at four Australian sites: the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre and the Lyell McEwin Hospital. Adults (n=176) diagnosed with a solid tumour or a haematological cancer scheduled to receive mucotoxic chemotherapy will be eligible. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive either the investigational product (IP) or placebo, both delivered as sublingual wafers. The active IP contains cannabidiol (300 mg/day) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (5-20 mg/day, titrated by the participant). The primary outcome is GI-M burden, determined by the Mucositis Daily Questionnaire. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include overall symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale), anorexia (Average Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy), depression/anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), financial toxicity (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity), quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire), incidence of chemotherapy dose reductions/modifications, cumulative dose of chemotherapy administered, incidence/length of hospitalisation, the use of supportive care, and the cost-benefit of the IP. The CANCAN trial prioritises patient experiences by focusing on patient-reported outcome measures and administering medicinal cannabis during active treatment to prevent symptoms that occur secondary to mucositis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by Central Adelaide Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (2022HRE00037). All participants will be required to provide written or digitally authorised informed consent. Trial results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, and at scientific conferences.

From the GC-MS analysis, the following bioactive compounds were found: cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and humulene. The antiproliferative activities of the extract were determined on HeLa cells by using MTT, Crystal Violet, and Trypan Blue assays with an IC50 value suggesting 51%-77.6% lethality. The bioinformatics analysis of molecular docking proved significant ligand-protein interactions of CBD, THC, and humulene with cancer-associated proteins such as PD-1/PD-L1, TNF-α, and MMP-9. In vivo, breast cancer was first established in female Sprague-Dawley rats with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) then treated with cannabinoids either singularly or in combination. Detailed treatment demonstrated that the use of the three cannabinoids simultaneously yielded the best anticancer and anti-inflammatory outcomes together with the best tumor reduction. The concentration of serum biomarkers of inflammation and tumor progression was substantially reduced in treated groups compared to the control group, which proves the synergistic effects of these cannabinoids in breast cancer therapy. This study emphasizes the importance of medical Cannabis sativa derivatives in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Commonly known as marijuana or hemp, Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabaceae), contains numerous active compounds, particularly cannabinoids, which have been extensively studied for their biological activities. Among these, cannabidiol (CBD) stands out for its therapeutic potential, especially given its non-psychotropic effects. This review evaluates the antitumor properties of CBD, highlighting its various mechanisms of action, including the induction of apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. By synthesizing findings from in vitro studies on the cell death mechanisms and signaling pathways activated by CBD in various human tumor cell lines, this literature review emphasizes the therapeutic promise of this natural antineoplastic agent. We conducted a comprehensive search of articles in PubMed, Scopus, Springer, Medline, Lilacs, and Scielo databases from 1984 to February 2022. Of the forty-three articles included, the majority (68.18%) reported that CBD activates apoptosis, while 18.18% observed simultaneous apoptosis and autophagy, 9.09% focused on autophagy alone, and 4.54% indicated necrosis. The antitumor effects of CBD appear to be mediated by transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPVs) in endometrial cancer, glioma, bladder cancer, and myeloma, with TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV4 playing key roles in activating apoptosis. This knowledge paves the way for innovative therapeutic strategies that may enhance cancer treatment outcomes while minimizing the toxicity and side effects associated with conventional therapies."

However, the safety and unclear bioactivity of CBD are still concerns and need to be examined to assess the impact of CBD on skin cells through cosmeceutical applications, particularly its impact on anti-aging and wound healing activities. Methods: In our study, the cytotoxicity of CBD was investigated on keratinocytes and fibroblasts in short-term and long-term treatments using a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and a clonogenic assay, respectively. Next, the antioxidant, anti-aging, and wound healing bioactivities of CBD were assessed. Then, we investigated the expression of the related genes. Results: Our results show that CBD at low concentrations (0.625-2.5 µg/mL) was not toxic to cells in the short-term treatment and significantly enhanced the growth of keratinocytes and fibroblasts under long-term exposure. Furthermore, CBD exhibited promising cellular bioactivities, including antioxidant and anti-aging activities in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and it enhanced wound healing in skin cells. Moreover, CBD has affected the expression of skin regenerative genes in fibroblasts via TGF-β, VEGF, and NF-κB expression. In addition, CBD promoted CO1A2 expression, which is related to collagen production. Conclusions: Altogether, our findings confirm the promising potential of CBD, showing that it can be applied in various topical cosmeceutical products. However, further studies, including in vivo studies and clinical trials, should be conducted to confirm the safety and long-term effectiveness of CBD on the skin."

However, its poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability, coupled with instability in physiological conditions, significantly limit its clinical use. Objectives: This study aimed to develop and characterize nanovesicles incorporating Tween 20 to enhance CBD encapsulation, stability, and the performance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Methods: Nanovesicles were prepared via thin-film hydration followed by sonication and optimized for size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. Stability studies were conducted under physiological conditions and during storage at 4 °C. In vitro release studies employed the dialysis bag method, while permeability across the BBB was assessed using PAMPA-BBB and the hCMEC/D3-BBB cell line, characterized for brain endothelial phenotype and largely employed as a model of human blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Cytotoxicity was evaluated via MTT and LDH assays. Results: The quantification of CBD was carried out by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS/MS. Nanovesicles with Tween 20 (VS-CBD) exhibited smaller size (65.27 ± 1.27 nm vs. 90.7 ± 0.2), lower polydispersity (0.230 ± 0.005 vs. 0.295 ± 0.003), and higher stability compared to conventional liposomes (L-CBD). VS-CBD achieved high encapsulation efficiency (96.80 ± 0.96%) and recovery (99.89 ± 0.52%). Release studies showed sustained CBD release with Higuchi model fitting (R2 = 0.9901). Both PAMPA-BBB and hCMEC/D3-BBB cell lines demonstrated an improved controlled permeability of the formulation compared to free CBD. Cytotoxicity tests confirmed the good biocompatibility of VS-CBD formulations. The addition of Tween 20 to nanovesicles enhanced CBD encapsulation, stability, and controlled release. Conclusions: These nanovesicles represent a promising strategy to improve CBD delivery to the brain, offering sustained therapeutic effects and reduced dosing frequency, potentially benefiting the treatment of neurological disorders."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Cannabidiol (CBD) is known for its anti-cancer properties in preclinical models and is increasingly used alongside conventional chemotherapy in cancer treatment. This study aims to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of CBD from Lebanese Cannabis sativa as a monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin or paclitaxel on human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells. Methods: Cytotoxicity of CBD was tested on OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3 cell lines using the MTS assay. The Chou-Talalay method and CompuSyn software were used to determine the combination indices (CIs) for predicting interactions between CBD and chemotherapeutic agents. CBD showed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition at 72 h with comparable IC50 values for both cell lines. Results: The combination of CBD with cisplatin or paclitaxel showed significant antagonistic interaction in SK-OV-3 cells (CI > 1), but mild synergism (CI < 1) at high growth inhibition rates (95% and 97%) was observed in SK-OV-3 cells with CBD/cisplatin. Pure antagonism was found in OVCAR-3 cells with CBD/cisplatin. Priming SK-OV-3 cells with CBD reduced the IC50 values of both drugs significantly, with a similar effect seen when cells were primed with cisplatin or paclitaxel before CBD treatment. Conclusions: Integrating CBD with chemotherapy could improve cancer therapy and address drug resistance. Sequential administration of CBD and chemotherapeutic agents is more beneficial than simultaneous administration. Further in vivo studies are necessary to validate these findings and understand CBD's interactions with other drugs fully."

      "abstract": "Background: Gardnerella vaginalis is a natural inhabitant of the vagina, but when an imbalance occurs in the vaginal microbiota, this bacterium can cause vaginosis, a condition that must be treated when symptomatic and prior to a gynecological intervention. Cannabidiol (CBD) is an anti-inflammatory compound that also has antibacterial activities against several Gram-positive and certain Gram-negative bacteria. Objectives: Since G. vaginalis is an opportunistic pathogenic Gram-variable bacterium, we investigated its response to CBD. Methods: The antibacterial activity of CBD was studied by broth dilution assay, changes in intracellular ATP levels, and the ability of bacteria to recover on chocolate agar plates. The antibiofilm activity was investigated by MTT metabolic assay, crystal violet staining, and HR-SEM. Flow cytometric analyses were performed to measure changes in membrane potential, membrane perforation, and metabolic activity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was analyzed using the nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reagent. Gene expression was determined by semi-quantitative real-time PCR, while protein composition was determined by LC-MS/MS analysis. Results: We observed that G. vaginalis clinical isolates exhibited high susceptibility to CBD with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2.5 µg/mL CBD. CBD induced rapid membrane hyperpolarization and caused cytoplasmic leakage of ATP without increasing propidium iodide uptake. This was accompanied by reduced metabolic activity and loss of survivability. Proteomic analysis revealed decreased expression of some ribosomal-associated proteins. CBD exhibited antioxidant activity by reducing intracellular ROS levels in a dose-dependent manner. The antibacterial effect was neutralized by the free radical scavenger α-tocopherol, suggesting the involvement of radicals in executing the antibacterial effect. Importantly, CBD not only prevented the biofilm formation of G. vaginalis but also reduced the metabolic activity and biofilm biomass of preformed, mature biofilms. Real-time PCR analysis of G. vaginalis treated with CBD for 6 h showed an increase in the expression of biofilm-associated genes, suggesting that the antibiofilm activity of CBD is mainly due to its antibacterial effect. CBD did not alter the ability of G. vaginalis to adhere to HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and CBD-treated bacteria were still phagocytosed by RAW264.7 macrophages. Conclusions: Our study shows that CBD exhibits antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against G. vaginalis clinical isolates and is thus a potential drug for the treatment of vaginosis caused by this bacterium."

      "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a transmembrane receptor within the ErbB family that plays a pivotal role in the progression of various aggressive cancers. HER2-positive tumors often develop resistance to standard therapies, necessitating the exploration of innovative treatment options. Cannabinoids, bioactive compounds from Cannabis sativa such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol (CBN), have gained attention for their potential anticancer properties. This study evaluates the efficacy of CBD, CBG, and CBN in targeting HER2-positive ovarian cancer through kinase inhibition assays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), molecular docking, and cell viability assessments. SPR analysis revealed that cannabinoids bind strongly to HER2-tyrosine kinase (HER2-TK), with CBD showing the highest affinity (K D = 6.16 μM), significantly better than afatinib (K D = 26.30 μM), and CBG demonstrating moderate affinity (K D = 17.07 μM). In kinase inhibition assays, CBG was the most potent inhibitor (IC50 = 24.7 nM), followed by CBD (IC50 = 38 nM), suggesting their ability to disrupt HER2-mediated signaling pathways. Molecular docking studies highlighted critical interactions between cannabinoids and essential HER2 residues (Leu796, Thr862, Asp863). In cell viability assays, CBD and CBG effectively inhibited the growth of HER2-positive SKOV3 cells (IC50 = 13.8 μM and 16.6 μM, respectively), comparable to traditional tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, particularly CBD and CBG, as alternative or adjunct therapies for HER2-positive cancers, with the promise of mitigating resistance and adverse effects associated with existing treatments."

      "abstract": "Despite extensive research on insulin resistance, which is associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity, there remains a lack of effective and safe methods to treat it. Thus, we hypothesized that cannabidiol (CBD), which influences lipid accumulation and inflammatory response, may interact with sphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling. To investigate the effects of CBD, male Wistar rats were fed a standard rodent chow or high-fat diet for 7 weeks to induce IR and were treated with CBD or its vehicle administered intraperitoneally for the last two weeks of the experiment. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess sphingolipid concentration in the liver, while multiplex assay and western blotting were used to investigate the level or expression of proteins in the insulin signaling pathway and sphingolipid metabolism. Our results revealed that CBD prevented ceramide deposition in the liver of high-fat-fed rats through inhibition of the ceramide de novo synthesis pathway. Moreover, the accumulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate was notably increased with impaired catabolic pathway. Observed changes in the sphingolipid pathway coincided with improved insulin signaling after CBD treatment in animals fed a high-fat diet. Considering the presented evidence, CBD exerted a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity in a state of lipid overload through the modification of sphingolipid deposition. Our study reveals the importance of broadening IR treatment methods, especially with natural substances that lack serious side effects such as CBD."

We aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic variability of CBD to elucidate relationships between doses, serum concentrations, metabolites, and biochemical markers of toxicity by using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data. METHODS: Data on serum concentrations of all ASMs, CBD, and the active metabolite 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD) were collected (January 2022 to June 2023) at the Section for Clinical Pharmacology, National Centre for Epilepsy, Oslo University Hospital. RESULTS: Data from 52 patients were included: 122 serum concentration measurements (1-7 per patient); 48% female, mean age 23 (range 3-55) years. At maintenance (n = 34), the mean daily dose was 535 (SD 224) mg, that is, 10.03 (standard deviation [SD] .49) mg/kg/day, serum concentration .26 (SD .14) for CBD and .13 (SD .10) μmol/L for 7-OH-CBD. Reference ranges of .15-.50 μmol/L for CBD and .04-.25 μmol/L for 7-OH-CBD are proposed, which included 80% of measurements. There was a linear correlation between CBD dose to concentration and CBD to CBD-7-OH concentrations (r2 = .39 and .38) (p < .05). The hepatic marker alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased on average 37%, demonstrating a moderate effect on liver function. Intra-individual coefficients of variation (CVs) were 32% (SD 17) for CBD and 48% (SD 24) for 7-OH-CBD (n = 15, ≥3 measurements). Twenty different ASMs were used: clobazam (n = 24), valproate (n = 17), and stiripentol (n = 8) were most common. The mean concentration ratio of desmethyl-clobazam/clobazam increased by 140% (7.29-17.5; p < .05) but was variable, pointing to enzyme inhibition by CBD. SIGNIFICANCE: This observational study with TDM data revealed extensive pharmacokinetic variability of CBD in patients with refractory epilepsy. The results demonstrate the need for close follow-up and use of TDM, including biochemical markers of toxicity, for individualized treatment with CBD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute pain levels following orthopaedic injury (eg, fracture) are a predictor of the onset of chronic pain, which affects nearly 50% of fracture patients and impairs functional recovery. Among current pharmacological treatments for acute pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been associated with delayed bone healing, while opioids inhibit effective bone remodelling, increase the risk of pseudarthrosis and carry a high risk of addiction. In light of this, the development of new pain treatments is essential. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-addictive and non-psychotropic cannabis component stands out as a potential therapeutic agent, given its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties as well as its potential benefits for bone healing. This randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effect of acute CBD treatment, compared with placebo, on patients' self-reported pain, inflammation and well-being following a fracture injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a triple-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 225 adults aged 18-70 years, who have suffered a long bone fracture and were treated at the Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, will be randomly assigned within 1 week to one of three treatment arms (25 mg or 50 mg of CBD or placebo) for 1 month. The primary outcome will be the difference in the pain score between groups at 1-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include measures of persistent pain, inflammation, opioid usage, quality of life, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, cognition and orthopaedic function. Data will be collected at baseline, 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study obtained a Health Canada licence for use of cannabis products. It has also been approved by Health Canada and the Research Ethics Board of the CIUSSS du Nord-de-l'Île-de-Montréal (Project ID 2025-2105). The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at local, national and international conferences. The trial's results will be made publicly available on the ClinicalTrials.gov database. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06448923.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-neurotoxic, phytocannabinoid from cannabis with reported medicinal properties, including antiepileptic and anti-inflammatory activity. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that CBD has antitumor potential against colorectal cancer (CRC), the third deadliest cancer in the world. However, as different mutations influence the antitumor effects and CBD can bind a variety of receptors, it is yet to be determined whether specific CRC mutations affect CBD's efficacy in treatment of CRC. To investigate this, we selected four CRC cell lines, including HCT116, HT-29, LS174T, and LS153, which harbor distinct mutations. Cells were treated with a range of concentrations of CBD to evaluate its cytotoxic effects and impact on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by using a live-cell imaging system. IC50 values were then calculated for each parameter. The level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway markers was also measured using qRTPCR. The requirements for CB1 or CB2 receptor-medicated signaling were investigated using the selective inhibitors AM251 and SR144528, respectively. Our results demonstrate that CBD induces apoptosis and halts proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. CBD showed potent antitumor effects in the tested cell lines with no obvious effect from different mutations such as KRAS, BRAF, APC, PTEN, etc. CBD also induced ER stress in CRC cells but not in healthy intestinal organoids. Cotreatment with SR144528 inhibited the effects of indicating involvement of CB2 receptor activation in the anticancer effects of CBD. Together, these results demonstrated that CBD could be effective for CRC regardless of the underlying mutation through CB2 receptor activation."

Evidence suggests that CBD promotes muscle injury recovery in athletes, but whether and how CBD improves endurance performance remains unclear. Here we investigated the effects of CBD treatment on exercise performance in mice and assessed whether this effect involves the gut microbiome. CBD administration significantly increased treadmill running performance in mice, accompanied by an increase in oxidative myofiber composition. CBD also increased mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of associated genes such as PGC-1α, phosphorylated CREB and AMPK in muscle tissue. Interestingly, CBD altered the composition of the gut microbiome, and antibiotic treatment reduced the muscle endurance-enhancing effects of CBD and mitochondrial biogenesis. We isolated Bifidobacterium animalis, a microbe increased by CBD administration, and named it KBP-1. Treatment with B. animalis KBP-1 in mice resulted in improved running performance. Whole-genome analysis revealed that B. animalis KBP-1 presented high expression of genes involved in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, expression of branched-chain amino acid release pumps and metabolism of lactic acid. In summary, our study identified CBD and B. animalis KBP-1 as potential endurance exercise-promoting agents.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, observational, before-and-after study was conducted including 20 patients with severe ASD who initiated treatment with purified CBD. Patients were evaluated using different scales at baseline and at three-month intervals during followup. RESULTS: The median total CBD dose was 363.5 mg (range, 100-700), and the median follow-up was 11 months (range, 6-12). As to the primary outcome evaluating symptoms reported by parents, improvement in at least one was observed after CBD initiation in 18 patients (90 %) and no improvement in two (10 %) (1 worsening, 1 no response). In the responders, 83.5 % (n = 76) of all reported symptoms improved. Regarding the secondary outcomes based on the assessment with different scales, improvement of around 30 % was found in irritability, social withdrawal, hyperactivity. Restricted and repetitive behavior improved in nine (50 %), while no changes were seen in seven (38.8 %). Sleep patterns were found to be slightly improved. Adverse effects were reported in 13 patients (65 %), mainly consisting of increased irritability and decreased appetite, but were mild or moderate and transient in all. In 40 % of the children, concomitant medication could be reduced or partially discontinued. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that treatment with purified CBD is effective and safe and could benefit patients with severe ASD by improving some of the core symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social interaction, as well as associated comorbidities.

Cannabidiol (CBD) is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target due to its pharmacological properties and mode of action in the endocannabinoid system. Recent systematic reviews (SR) on CBD and SUDs have shown inconsistent results. The objective of this umbrella review was to determine whether CBD alone or in combination with Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is effective for managing and treating SUDs. METHODS: Following a registered protocol, we searched PubMed, Web of Science and Epistemonikos databases for SRs, with or without a meta-analysis, of randomized controlled trials focusing on interventions dispensing CBD, alone or in combination with THC, to treat SUDs, published from 1 January 2000 to 15 October 2024. Screening, data extraction and quality assessment with the AMSTAR 2 tool were performed by two researchers in parallel and duplicated. RESULTS: 22 SRs were included, 5 of which performed a meta-analysis. We found mixed evidence regarding the efficacy of CBD to manage and treat SUDs. Findings were interpreted in light of the quality of the SRs. Nabiximols, which contains CBD and THC, demonstrated positive effects on cannabis withdrawal and craving symptoms. Evidence supporting the efficacy of CBD is limited and inconclusive for abstinence, reduction or cessation of use of cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, opiates and other psychoactive substances. CONCLUSION: Cannabidiol (CBD) monotherapy does not appear to be efficacious for treatment of substance use disorders. CBD primarily exhibits effects on cannabis withdrawal and craving when combined with Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Existing data on the efficacy of CBD alone with regard to other outcomes related to substance use disorders are limited.",

To overcome these limitations, we proposed the production of a nanoemulsion with CBD to be included in the therapeutic treatment of autism spectrum disorder. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of CBD-rich corn oil nanoemulsion treatment in male rats born to females exposed to valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy on autistic-like behaviors and hippocampal histology. Offspring rats were treated orally twice daily with CBD nanoemulsions at different doses (1 and 2 mg/animal). The endpoints evaluated were anxiety, grooming time, exploratory activity, sociability, the social preference index, and hippocampal and cerebral cortex histology. All formulations were characterized as nanoemulsions and showed a reduced vesicle size (107.6 - 72.6 nm), low PDI (0.290-0.432), negative zeta potential (-40.6 mv), and good stability. Prenatal exposure to VPA increased anxiety and grooming time, and reduced exploratory activity, sociability, and the social preference index in the animals. Furthermore, VPA-exposed animals exhibited elevated neuronal death and a reduction in viable cells in the hippocampus. In conclusion, CBD nanoemulsion treatment reversed autistic-like behaviors, potentially by protecting against hippocampal neuronal death.

Offspring rats were treated orally twice daily with CBD nanoemulsions at different doses (1 and 2 mg/animal). The endpoints evaluated were anxiety, grooming time, exploratory activity, sociability, the social preference index, and hippocampal and cerebral cortex histology. All formulations were characterized as nanoemulsions and showed a reduced vesicle size (107.6 - 72.6 nm), low PDI (0.290-0.432), negative zeta potential (-40.6 mv), and good stability. Prenatal exposure to VPA increased anxiety and grooming time, and reduced exploratory activity, sociability, and the social preference index in the animals. Furthermore, VPA-exposed animals exhibited elevated neuronal death and a reduction in viable cells in the hippocampus. In conclusion, CBD nanoemulsion treatment reversed autistic-like behaviors, potentially by protecting against hippocampal neuronal death.",

      "abstract": "A unifying mechanistic cause for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains uncertain. Multiple pathophysiological processes appear to occur simultaneously. Cannabinoids, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and others found in cannabis, and cannabis extracts (CEs), appear to have activity in these pathogenic pathways, which have led to increasing interest in cannabinoids as therapeutic agents for ALS. The use of cannabinoids as a treatment strategy is substantiated by preclinical evidence suggesting a role for the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Preclinical data indicate that cannabis and CEs have powerful antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. The use of CEs in SOD1G93A murine models has been shown to prolong neuronal cell survival, which leads to delayed onset of the disease state, and slows progression of the disease. Although research in humans remains limited, a few studies suggest that cannabis and CBD, in humans, provide benefits for both motor symptoms, including rigidity, cramps, and fasciculations, and non-motor symptoms including sleep quality, pain, emotional state, quality of life, and depression. There remains a need for further, well-designed clinical trials to validate further the use of an individual cannabinoid, or a combination of cannabinoids, as a disease-modifying therapy for ALS."

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinized cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells that affects many patients worldwide. There is no cure for psoriasis, and its pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. Alterations in some TRIM family proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in the exacerbation of psoriasis, however, the molecular mechanism of TRIM14 in psoriasis is unknown. Here, we show that TRIM14 is highly expressed in psoriasis patients and is closely associated with the progression of psoriasis. A possible mechanism is that TRIM14 binds to TRAF3 and mediates the autophagic degradation of TRAF3 through the selective autophagy receptor NDP52, activating the NF-κB pathway. In addition, cannabidiol (CBD) can effectively inhibit the proliferation of keratinocytes, possibly by inhibiting the expression of TRIM14 and attenuating the continuous activation of the NF-κB pathway in psoriasis. CBD-loaded hydrogel microneedle patches significantly improved the symptoms of keratoderma thickening, erythema and desquamation in psoriatic mice and reduced the levels of inflammatory factors in psoriatic skin tissue and blood, as well as the spleen index compared with Tacrolimus cream (positive control). In summary, TRIM14, which is highly expressed in psoriasis patients, may be a potential target and provide new ideas for the treatment of psoriasis. In addition, the CBD hydrogel microneedle patches developed for TRIM14 has obvious therapeutic effects and provides a new option for future drug therapy for psoriasis patients.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main actives from Cannabis sativa has been perpetually explored lately for its therapeutic effects. Its main attributes, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, snowball into pain management, epilepsy and seizure alleviation, anxiety relief, as well as numerous other implications through the entire metabolism. However, conventional administration routes challenge its therapeutic potential, with reported poor water solubility, hepatic degradation, gastric instability and erratic bioavailability observed in oral administration. As a result, the transdermal delivery systems have emerged as a promising alternative to oral or inhaled routes, offering improved bioavailability and targeted effects. The medical use of CBD throughout Europe, UK, USA or Australia is extensive and usually represented by pharmaceutical preparations recommended after conventional treatment routs fail. The non-medical use is limited by each country's own legislation, a wider range of products being available, but the irregular regulatory landscape coupled with the growing market of cannabinoid-infused products, emphasizes the need for standardized formulations and further clinical research. The present work critically examines the transdermal administration of cannabidiol, explores the skin's potential as a route and the strategies involved in using it for systemic targeting. We highlighted key challenges and provided insights into CBD`s variable bioavailability based on different administration routes and methods, thus compiling a literature-based absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study. We also explore the role of the endocannabinoid system, its function in various medical conditions, and the therapeutic effects associated with CBD, particularly in light of the varying legislation across countries. While the breadth of potential benefits is compelling, it is essential to emphasize the ongoing nature of CBD research as individual responses to it can vary significantly.",

METHOD: This qualitative study included interviews and validated self-report with clients (n=14) at baseline, one month and three months after receiving adjunct medical cannabis treatment in addition to standard of care. Interviews with program staff (n=7) supplemented assessment of barriers and facilitators to program delivery. RESULTS: Clients reported that the cannabis substitution program demonstrates promise to help reduce problematic substance use by reducing drug cravings and assisting with pain and other comorbid symptoms. The program also helped to destigmatize medical cannabis use. Staff reports highlighted the importance of MC education, clear guidelines for dispensing MC, and an accessible framework for program delivery to facilitate effective uptake of this novel intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility of integrating MC in a supportive residential recovery program. Important factors for success include provision of cannabis education, developing a clear organizational framework and establishing evidence-informed policies within the context of substitution therapy and harm reduction. Further research to more formally evaluate integrating MC in residential substance use treatment is encouraged."

      "abstract": "Abdominal pain is the most disabling symptom of inflammatory bowel diseases, but current treatments are limited, leading patients to seek alternatives such as cannabis. Cannabis contains over 100 cannabinoids which, unlike tetrahydrocannabinol, are biologically active compounds often without psychotropic effects (ie, nonpsychotropic cannabinoids [npCBs]). These npCBs have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and may show potentiating effects when administered in combination, referred to as the entourage effect. Here, we investigated the analgesic effects of cannabichromene, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin, and cannabigerol (CBG), individually and in combination, using the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium colitis-induced visceral hypersensitivity (VHS). We then explored antinociceptive targets through patch-clamp electrophysiology on dorsal root ganglia neurons and recombinant channels. We found that a single injection of 10 mg/kg of either CBD or CBG reduced both VHS and c-Fos activation in the spinal dorsal horn. Moreover, a combination of npCBs consisting of 5 mg/kg CBD with 1 mg/kg of cannabichromene, cannabidivarin, and CBG-all at subtherapeutic dosages-reduced VHS, without altering colitis. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the antinociceptive mixture of npCBs acts through voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, particularly Cav2.2, but not Cav3.2 and Kv channels. These results suggest that CBD, CBG, and a mixture of npCBs given at subtherapeutic doses may be beneficial in managing VHS associated with inflammatory bowel disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cannabis is increasingly used as an alternative treatment for managing pain associated with chronic conditions. Nonpsychotropic cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, interact with ionotropic and voltage-gated ion channels. In our study, we demonstrated that cannabidiol, cannabigerol, and a combination of nonpsychotropic cannabinoids, administered at subtherapeutic doses, effectively alleviated visceral hypersensitivity associated with inflammatory bowel disease.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a recognized global public health problem. However, there are still limitations in the available therapeutic approaches and a lack of clinically effective drugs. Therefore, an in-depth exploration of the secondary pathological mechanism of TBI and the identification of new effective drugs are urgently needed. Cannabidiol (CBD), a component derived from the cannabis plant, has potential therapeutic effects on neurological diseases and has received increasing attention. However, few reports on CBD intervention in TBI patients exist. Here, we use the Feeney free-fall method to establish a rat TBI model. CBD significantly improves neurological deficit scores, neuronal damage and blood-brain barrier permeability in rats and significantly inhibits the expressions of the brain injury markers S-100β and NSE. Mechanistically, CBD attenuates TBI-induced astrocyte activation, reduces inflammation, and attenuates the expressions of inflammatory prostaglandin system indicators. The use of TG6-10-1 (EP2 inhibitor) and H-89 (PKA inhibitor) indicates that CBD attenuates TBI-induced neurological damage via the PGE 2-EP2-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. Overall, this research provides a novel drug candidate for the treatment of clinical brain trauma."

METHODS: Forty male Wistar Albino rats were randomly divided into four groups, each consisting of 10 rats: Sham, Trauma, Trauma + CBD, and CBD. The rats were treated with a single dose of 5 mg/kg CBD intraperitoneally 30 min before trauma. Then, the trauma were exposed to a weight of 200 g and a height of 1 m. After sacrifice, the lung tissues were removed for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic analyses. RESULTS: Pulmonary injury of trauma group led to increases in tumor necrosis factor α, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2-associated X protein expressions, total oxidant status, oxidative stress index levels, and decreases in B-cell lymphoma expression and total antioxidant levels. Additionally, inflammatory cell infiltration, damage-related emphysema, pronounced hyperemia, and increased septal tissue thickness were observed histopathologically. CBD treatment ameliorated all these findings. CONCLUSION: CBD reduces lung damage in lung contusions caused by blunt chest trauma through its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. More detailed studies investigating other important intracellular pathways are needed.",

      "abstract": "Tau is a neuronal protein that confers stability to microtubules; however, its hyperphosphorylation and accumulation can lead to an impairment of protein degradation pathways, such as autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosomal catabolic process responsible for degrading cytosolic components, being essential for cellular homeostasis and survival. In this context, autophagy modulation has been postulated as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies point to the modulatory and neuroprotective role of the cannabinoid system in neurodegenerative models and here it was investigated the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on autophagy in a human neuroblastoma strain (SH-SY5Y) that overexpresses the EGFP-Tau WT (Wild Type) protein in an inducible Tet-On system way. The results demonstrated that CBD (100 nM and 10 µM) decreased the expression of AT8 and total tau proteins, activating autophagy, evidenced by increased expression of light chain 3-II (LC3-II) protein and formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, the cannabinoid compounds CBD, ACEA (CB1 agonist) and GW-405,833 (CB2 agonist) decreased the fluorescence intensity of EGFP-Tau WT; and when chloroquine, an autophagic blocker, was used, there was a reversal in the fluorescence intensity of EGFP-Tau WT with CBD (1 and 10 µM) and GW-405,833 (2 µM), demonstrating the possible participation of autophagy in these groups. Thus, it was possible to conclude that CBD induced autophagy in EGFP-Tau WT cells which increased tau degradation, showing its possible neuroprotective role. Hence, this study may contribute to a better understanding of how cannabinoids can modulate autophagy and present a potential therapeutic target in a neurodegeneration model.",

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of data collected from baseline (1 month before CBD treatment initiation) until 12 months' treatment, CBD discontinuation, death, or loss to follow up. RESULTS: At baseline, all 26 patients enrolled (LGS, n = 17; DS, n = 9; male, 73 %; mean [range] age, 11.8 [3.0-17.0] years) experienced motor seizures; 92 % were taking ≥ 1 antiseizure medication. Median (IQR) CBD dosage at 6 months (6 M; n = 12) was 6.0 (2.7) mg/kg/day, and 12 months (12 M; n = 9) 7.3 (2.1) mg/kg/day. Median (IQR) percentage change from baseline for motor seizures was - 56.7 % (60.7) at 6 M (n = 20), and - 60.0 % (53.3) at 12 M (n = 15). Patients experiencing ≥ 50 % and ≥ 75 % reduction in motor seizures were 13/20 (65 %) and 5/20 (25 %) at 6 M, respectively, and 10/15 (67 %) and 6/15 (40 %) at 12 M, respectively.

Recently, concerns have been raised regarding the male reproductive toxicity of CBD in animal models, such as monkeys, rats, and mice. In our previous studies, we reported that CBD inhibited cell proliferation in both primary human Sertoli cells and mouse Sertoli TM4 cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that in primary human Sertoli cells CBD disrupted DNA replication, cell cycle, and DNA repair, ultimately causing cellular senescence. In this study, we further investigated the molecular changes induced by CBD in mouse Sertoli TM4 cells using RNA-sequencing analyses and compared the transcriptomic profile with that of primary human Sertoli cells. Our findings demonstrated that, unlike in primary human Sertoli cells, CBD did not induce cellular senescence but caused apoptosis in mouse Sertoli TM4 cells. Through transcriptomic data analysis in mouse Sertoli TM4 cells, immune and cellular stress responses were identified. Moreover, transcriptomic comparisons revealed major differences in molecular changes induced by CBD between mouse Sertoli TM4 and primary human Sertoli cells. This suggests that primary human Sertoli cells and mouse Sertoli cells may respond differently to CBD.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the principal constituents of Cannabis Sativa with no psychoactive properties. CBD is a promising neuroprotective compound bearing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, considering its low solubility, CBD delivery to the retina represents an unresolved issue. The first aim was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of CBD in an in vivo model of retinal excitotoxicity induced by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). Rats underwent intravitreal co-injection of AMPA (42 nmol) and CBD (10-4 M). The neuroprotective effect of CBD was investigated with histology and immunohistochemical evaluation of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers. CBD reversed the AMPA-induced total retinal, inner nuclear layer and inner plexiform layer shrinkage and loss of amacrine cells. Moreover, CBD decreased the AMPA induced number of cleaved caspase-3, Iba-1 and nitrotyrosine (NT) positive cells. Based on this evidence, we developed a nanotechnological formulation of CBD to overcome critical issues related to its eye delivery. Particularly, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) loaded with CBD were prepared, optimized and characterized. Due to the optimal physicochemical characteristics, CBD-NLC3 has been selected and the in vitro release profile has been investigated. Additionally, CBD-NLC3 was topically administered to rats, and retinal CBD levels were determined. CBD-NLC3 formulation, after a single topical administration, efficiently delivered CBD in the retina (Cmax = 98 ± 25.9 ng/mg; Tmax = 60 min), showing a high translational value. In conclusion, these findings showed a good PD/PK profile of CBD warranting further pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of the new formulation for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cannabidiol (CBD) reduces alcohol-seeking behaviors and may have potential for managing alcohol use disorder (AUD). In this study, we examined the effects of CBD versus placebo on (i) psychophysiological, craving and anxiety responses to alcohol and appetitive cues; (ii) tolerability measures including cognitive functioning. METHODS: Twenty-two non-treatment-seeking individuals with AUD (DSM-5) participated in a cross-over, double-blind, randomized trial, receiving either 800 mg of CBD or matched placebo over 3 days. A laboratory alcohol cue reactivity task with appetitive control (juice) and alcohol exposures, and subsequent recovery periods to examine regulation of cue-elicited responses after cue-offset (recovery) was completed, with psychophysiological indices of autonomic nervous system activity (skin conductance, high-frequency heart rate variability [HF-HRV]) and self-reported measures (alcohol craving and anxiety). Self-reported scales of sedation and neuropsychological executive function tasks were also completed. RESULTS: CBD sessions were significantly associated with elevated parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity across the task, as indicated by increased HF-HRV. Reductions in self-reported anxiety during cue exposure stages compared to placebo sessions were also evidenced. Reductions in self-reported alcohol craving after cue exposure were seen during CBD sessions only. There were no significant differences between CBD and placebo on executive functioning performance. CONCLUSIONS: In a short-term regimen, CBD appears to modulate PNS activity, reduce cue-elicited anxiety during cue exposure and reduce alcohol craving after cue exposure while not significantly impairing cognition. Large, parallel clinical trials with longer term regimens are now needed to determine the therapeutic potential of CBD in the management of AUD."

OBJECTIVES: To conduct an extensive literature review and meta-analysis of CBD use for DRE in adult PWE. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and two electronic resources; we searched Ovid MEDLINE and Scopus using appropriate keywords until August 2023. Data were presented as standardized mean difference (SMD) and odds ratio with confidence interval (CI) via random effect. We appraised the risk of bias of the included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool while their strength of evidence with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) and Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Education (GRADE) Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: We identified 16 studies, 3 of which were randomized controlled trials and 3 prospective cohort studies, while the rest were expanded access programs, deriving a total of 668 participants receiving CBD for seizure control. CBD was used concomitantly with antiseizure medications in all studies. There was a statistically significant seizure reduction in the group receiving CBD therapy compared to the placebo group (SMD: -1.50, 95% CI (-3.47, 0.47), p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The evidence on CBD use in adult patients with DRE demonstrates a moderate level of certainty according to GRADE level and OCEBM level 2. Further prospective studies involving multiple centers are encouraged to study both the efficacy and safety of CBD in adult patients with DRE.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapeutic agent widely used for cancer treatment and has non-negligible cardiotoxicity. Some previous studies have reported that cannabidiol (CBD) has cardioprotective effects. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of CBD against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury, and explored the downstream molecular mechanism. METHODS AND MATERIALS: GSE193861, containing healthy myocardial tissues and myocardial tissues with DOX-induced injury, was analyzed to screen for the involved proteins and pathways. Molecular docking was performed to identify candidate drugs. After H9c2 cells were treated with DOX and CBD, their viability, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were assessed. After YAP depletion, the role of the Hippo pathway in CBD function was investigated. C57BL/6 mice were treated with DOX to establish an in vivo model, and CBD and verteporfin (VP) were used to treat the mice. Histological analyses and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate myocardial tissue injury, and apoptosis and oxidative stress of the myocardial tissues were also analyzed. Western blotting was used to investigate the regulatory effects of CBD on the Hippo and apoptosis-related pathways. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the Hippo pathway was a crucial pathway involved in DOX-induced myocardial injury. Molecular docking showed that CBD targeted multiple regulators of the Hippo pathway. CBD showed cardioprotective effects against DOX-induced myocardial injury both in vitro and in vivo and regulated Hippo pathway activity in cardiomyocytes. After inactivation of the Hippo pathway by YAP knockdown or VP intervention, the protective effects of CBD were reversed. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we revealed that CBD is likely to reduce DOX-induced myocardial injury by regulating the Hippo signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The official implementation of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis raw materials for medicinal use has permitted doctors to prescribe and pharmacists to prepare cannabis-based formulations. The objective of the pharmaceutical development and manufacturing process optimization work was to propose a suppository formulation containing doses of 25 mg and 50 mg of tetra-hydrocannabinol (∆-9-THC) as an alternative to existing inhalable or orally administered formulations. The formulation could be used for rectal or vaginal administration, thereby providing dosage control in the treatment of endometriosis and other conditions involving pain. In this study, two substrates from suppositories with standardized Cannabis extractum normatum (CEX) were used: cocoa butter and Witepsol® H15. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The long-term stability of CEX was investigated over a period of up to 24 months. The concentrations of ∆-9-THC, cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol (CBN) were determined using an HPLC method. Furthermore, the water content of the extract, the ethanol residue, and the microbiological purity were determined. The pharmaceutical properties of CEX-incorporated suppositories, namely content uniformity, hardness, softening time, total deformation time, disintegration time, and the release profile of ∆-9-THC, CBD, and CBN, were evaluated in order to develop optimal preparation procedures for pharmacists. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Following a 24-month stability study on CEX, no significant alterations in component content were observed beyond the specified requirements. The disintegration time, total deformation time, and hardness of the suppositories based on Witepsol® H15 with CEX were found to be longer and higher, respectively, than those of suppositories formulated with cocoa butter. In vitro studies demonstrated that suppositories prepared with Witepsol® H15 exhibited superior release of ∆-9-THC compared to those prepared with cocoa butter. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that pharmacists making prescription drugs in a pharmacy setting in the form of medical marijuana suppositories will receive a better release profile of the drug by choosing Witepsol® H15 as a substrate."

Various tools have been suggested to achieve an objective evaluation, including infrared thermography (IRT). The objective of this study was to assess the facial thermal nociceptive response produced by the use of cannabidiol (CBD) alone and in combination with meloxicam in female dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy anesthetized with isoflurane. Sixty-four female dogs of different breeds were randomly distributed into four study groups according to the treatment received. G1: Placebo group (n = 16); G2: Group receiving intravenous meloxicam as premedication (0.2 mg Kg-1) and every 24 h postoperatively 0.1 mg Kg-1 (n = 16); G3: Group treated with CBD (n = 16) at a dose of 2 mg kg-1 orally every 12 h; and G4: Group medicated with the combination of both treatments (n = 16). All treatments were administered for 48 h postoperatively. After the anesthetic surgical procedure, radiometric images were captured using IRT and physiological parameters during the events EBasal, E30min, E1h, E2h, E3h, E4h, E8h, E12h, E24h and E48h. Overall, it was found that the high, medium and low temperatures of the thermal windows of the eye, upper eyelid and lower eyelid, as well as the average temperature of the lacrimal gland in G1 between events, were significantly lower at E30min, E1h and E2h compared to EBasal (p = 0.01). Among treatments, a significantly higher temperature was observed in groups G2, G3 and G4 compared to G1 (p = 0.001) in the thermal windows of the upper eyelid, lower eyelid, lacrimal gland and ocular areas. Regarding physiological parameters, heart rate (HR) was higher in G1 compared to the animals in G2, G3 and G4 (p = 0.03). The respiratory rate (RR) was significantly lower in all four study groups during the postoperative events compared to their respective EBasal (p < 0.05), while among treatments, G2, G3 and G4 had a lower RR compared to G1 (p = 0.03). Mild hypothermia was observed in all study groups at E30min and E1h compared to EBasal (p = 0.001). No significant correlation was found between the temperatures of the assessed thermal regions and the physiological traits. In conclusion, CBD, whether administered alone or in combination with meloxicam, demonstrated comparable analgesic efficacy, which could control nociceptive cardiorespiratory and hemodynamic autonomic responses, as there were no significant changes in the facial thermal response between treatments G2, G3 and G4."

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids include both endogenous endocannabinoids and exogenous phytocannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), and have potential as therapeutic agents in cancer treatment due to their selective anticancer activities. CBD exhibits both antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects depending on its concentration and cell types. These properties allow CBD to influence oxidative stress responses and potentially enhance the efficacy of antitumor therapies. In this study, we treated U87MG glioma cells with low dose (1 μM) CBD and evaluated its molecular effects. Our findings indicate that CBD reduced cell viability by 20% (p < 0.05) through the alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential. The alteration of redox status by CBD caused an attempt to rescue mitochondrial functionality through nuclear localization of the GABP transcription factor involved in mitochondria biogenesis. Moreover, CBD treatment caused an increase in autophagic flux, as supported by the increase in Beclin-1 and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. Due to mitochondria functionality alteration, pro-apoptotic proteins were induced without activating apoptotic effectors Caspase-3 or Caspase-7. The study of the transcription factor NRF2 and the ubiquitin-binding protein p62 expression revealed an increase in their levels in CBD-treated cells. In conclusion, low-dose CBD makes U87MG cells more vulnerable to cytotoxic effects, reducing cell viability and mitochondrial dynamics while increasing autophagic flux and redox systems. This explains the mechanisms by which glioma cells respond to CBD treatment. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of CBD, suggesting that modulating NRF2 and autophagy pathways could represent a promising strategy for glioblastoma treatment."

This study evaluated chronic cannabidiol (CBD) treatment effects in male and female rats subjected to the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model of depression. We analyzed the gene expression related to neuroinflammation, cannabinoid signaling, estrogen receptors, and specific microRNAs in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), CA1, and ventral subiculum (VS). UCMS influenced immobility in a sex-specific manner, increasing it in males and decreasing it in females, effects that were reversed by CBD. CBD also normalized the UCMS-induced upregulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the CA1 and VS in males. In both sexes, UCMS induced the upregulation of the nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NF-κB1) gene in the VS, which was unaffected by CBD. Additionally, CBD reversed CB1 downregulation in the VS of males but not in the vmPFC of either sex. In males, CBD restored the UCMS-induced downregulation of VS estrogen receptor genes ERα and ERβ. UCMS also altered miR-146a-5p expression, downregulating it in females (VS) and upregulating it in males (CA1), with no CBD effect. These findings highlight the sex-specific mechanisms of CBD's antidepressant effect, with hippocampal neuroinflammatory and estrogenic pathways playing a key role in males.",

Cannabidiol (CBD), exhibits diverse anti-cancer effects in various cancers, offering avenues for improving CCA treatment. This study investigated the effects of CBD on human CCA cells and the underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: The effects of CBD on three CCA cell lines (KKU-213B, KKU-100, KKU-055) were assessed using the SRB assay, clonogenic assay, cell cycle arrest, and 3D holotomography. Morphological changes were examined using transmission electron microscopy, while mitochondrial ROS levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were studied using MitoSOX, JC-1, and DCFH-DA. Cellular senescence induction was evaluated via SA-β-gal staining. Protein associatedwith autophagy and cellular senescence were analyzed using Western blot and/or immunofluorescent assays. A xenograft model demonstrated the anti-tumor activity of CBD and the induction of cellular senescence through immunohistochemistry targeting PCNA, β-gal, and p21. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: CBD effectively inhibited CCA cell proliferation, suppressed colony formation and induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Morphological examination revealed lipid droplets/vesicles in CCA cell lines. CBD induced autophagy by upregulating LC3BII, downregulating p62, and inhibiting the p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR pathways. Additionally, CBD disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis by elevating ROS, reducing membrane potential, and induced cellular senescence by increasing the expression of p53 and p21. In-vitro results were confirmed by xenograft models. Overall, CBD suppresses proliferation and induces cell death, autophagy and senescence in CCA cells via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which indicates a therapeutic option for CCA treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of oral Cannabidiol (CBD) on interference during learning and memory (L&M) in healthy human volunteers has not been studied. METHOD: A two-arm crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Colorado State University Pueblo (CSU Pueblo) to evaluate the effects of 246 mg oral CBD on L&M in healthy adults. Among 57 healthy volunteers enrolled, 35 were included in the analyses. For assessment of L&M, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was used to evaluate verbal baseline cognitive function; RAVLT-R tests (List A and List B recalls, Proactive and Retroactive Interference ratios, and Forgetting Speed ratio) were used to evaluate verbal declarative memory; and total prose recall was used to evaluate verbal logical memory. Linear Mixed Models with Bonferroni Corrections were used to compare L&M results between primary outcomes (CBD vs. placebo) and secondary demographic outcomes, with a two-tailed statistical significance of P < 0.05. RESULTS: CBD administration did not affect any of the dependent variables measured compared to the placebo group. There were no effects of THC, history of CBD use, or sex on CBD's modulation of L&M. However, a highly significant interaction effect between treatment groups (CBD vs. placebo) and age of subjects was observed for the PI ratio (P = 0.008; n = 35). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that administration of oral CBD alone does not significantly impair L&M in healthy adults. However, age might influence CBD related modulation of proactive interference during human L&M. Future research involving a larger group of older adults is needed to confirm this potential effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the CSU Pueblo IRB, conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06074172)."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene, making muscle fibers susceptible to contraction-induced membrane damage. Given the potential beneficial action of cannabidiol (CBD), we evaluated the in vitro effect of full-spectrum CBD oil on the viability of dystrophic muscle fibers and the in vivo effect on myopathy of the mdx mouse, a DMD model. METHODS: In vitro, dystrophic cells from the mdx mouse were treated with full-spectrum CBD oil and assessed with cell viability and cytotoxic analyses. In vivo, fourteen-day-old mdx mice received 10 mg/kg/day of the full-spectrum CBD oil for 14 days. We analyzed creatine kinase (CK) levels, liver damage markers, and histopathology of the diaphragm (DIA) and quadriceps (QUA [myonecrotic fibers with positive IgG staining, regenerated fibers/central nuclei, the minimum Feret's diameter, the fibrosis area, the inflammatory area, the presence of macrophages, and NF-kappa B content]). RESULTS: In vitro treatment with full-spectrum CBD oil showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect; however, in vivo 10 mg/kg treatment was safe and effectively improved DMD histopathological assessment parameters in DIA and QUA: reduction of central nuclei: 1.7% ± 2.0% versus 22.4% ± 5.3% and 11.1% ± 10.7% versus 32.3% ± 4.6%; reduction of IgG+ myofibers: 0.6% ± 0.7% versus 8.4% ± 1.6% and 0.9% ± 0.3% versus 7.5% ± 1.0%; increase in myofiber size: 85.2 ± 3.2 versus 64.3 ± 4.0 μm and 106.5 ± 8.6 versus 81.2 ± 4.8 μm; decrease in inflammatory area: 6.2% ± 2.7% versus 15.1% ± 2.6% and 5.3 ± 4.1 versus 17.3% ± 2.8%; reduced macrophage area: 0.05% ± 0.1% versus 10.8% ± 4.3% and 1.0% ± 0.7% versus 10.3% ± 4.9%; NF-κB levels: 0.6% ± 0.1% versus 1.7% ± 0.2% and 1.7% ± 0.1% versus 5.2% ± 2.1%; and fibrosis: 5.6% ± 1.8% versus 12.0% ± 3.7% and 1.3% ± 0.5% versus 4.7% ± 1.5%. It also reduced serum CK. DISCUSSION: Full-spectrum CBD oil may represent a promising new approach to treating DMD, but its potential toxicity must be considered.",

Recent preclinical research suggests that CBD's multifaceted mechanisms of action in the brain, which involve multiple molecular targets, underlie its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, and antipsychotic effects. Clinical trials are also exploring CBD's therapeutic potential beyond its current uses. This review focuses on CBD's polypharmacological profile and discusses the latest preclinical and clinical findings regarding its efficacy in neuropsychiatric disorders. Existing evidence suggests that CBD's ability to modulate multiple signaling pathways may benefit neuropsychiatric disorders, and we propose further research areas to clarify its mechanisms, address data gaps, and refine its therapeutic indications.",

      "abstract": "Pain impacts billions of people worldwide, but treatment options are limited and have a spectrum of adverse effects. The search for safe and nonaddictive pain treatments has led to a focus on key mediators of nociceptor excitability. Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in the peripheral nervous system-Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9-play crucial roles in pain signaling. Among these, Nav1.8 has shown promise due to its rapid recovery from inactivation and role in repetitive firing, with recent clinical studies providing proof-of-principal that block of Nav1.8 can reduce pain in humans. We report here that three nonpsychotomimetic cannabinoids-cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol (CBN)-effectively inhibit Nav1.8, suggesting their potential as analgesic compounds. In particular, CBG shows significant promise due to its ability to effectively inhibit excitability of peripheral sensory neurons. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, particularly CBG, as agents that may attenuate pain via block of Nav1.8, warranting further in vivo studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-based and cannabidiol (CBD)-based products are increasing in popularity for the management of pain. Cannabis-based products may serve as a valuable alternative to traditional analgesics such as opioids for pain management among orthopedic patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perspective of orthopedic sports medicine patients regarding the use of THC- and CBD-based products for the management of musculoskeletal pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A short, 11-question survey was distributed to orthopedic sports medicine patients in clinic and via email. Survey participation was voluntary. Retrospective chart review was conducted for participating patients to collect additional data such as visit diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients completed the survey. Most were familiar or somewhat familiar with THC (61%) and CBD (63.2%) products and their use for musculoskeletal pain. Of the patients, 53.3% were aware of friends and family currently using CBD products to help manage musculoskeletal pain. Of the patients, 81.3% were amenable to receiving THC-based products and 90.1% were amenable to receiving CBD-based products for the management of their musculoskeletal pain. The patients were statistically more amenable to receiving CBD-based products than THC-based products (P=.017). Among the patients, 85.3% believed cannabis-based products would help in the fight against the opioid epidemic. CONCLUSION: Orthopedic patients are aware of THC- and CBD-based products, and the majority are willing to receive these products to help manage their musculoskeletal pain and orthopedic-related issues. Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of the increasing popularity of CBD-based products and educate themselves and their patients regarding the appropriate use of them.

      "abstract": "Current chelation treatments used for cadmium poisoning may cause some serious side effects. Thus, safer novel treatments could be promising for clinical use. This study evaluated the effects of cannabidiol on Cd toxicity. Four groups of 10 mice were formed: Groups I and III were cadmium-free, while groups II and IV received 50 mg/L cadmium in drinking water. Groups III and IV received daily cannabidiol (25 mg/kg) via intragastric gavage. After 30 days, the animals were killed, and blood and tissue samples were collected. Oxidative stress and inflammation markers, including glutathione, catalase, myeloperoxidase, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, were analysed using ELISA. Additionally, histological evaluations of the liver, kidney and testis were performed. Cadmium exposure reduced glutathione and catalase levels in the blood, liver, kidney and testis, while increasing myeloperoxidase. Cannabidiol mitigated these effects on oxidative stress markers. Cannabidiol also reduced the increase in proinflammatory cytokines. Histopathological analysis revealed reduced liver and kidney damage in cannabidiol-treated groups compared to cadmium-only groups. In addition, histopathological evaluation showed CBD had no protective effect on the testicular tissue against Cd toxicity. Our results indicate that cannabidiol protects against some toxic effects of cadmium. If confirmed by future studies, cannabidiol may be proposed as a novel treatment for cadmium toxicity.",

      "abstract": "The present study was aimed at revealing the metabolic changes that occurred in the cellular lipid pattern of acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia cells following treatment with cannabidiol (CBD). CBD is a non-psychoactive compound present in Cannabis sativa L., which has shown an antiproliferative action in these type of cancer cells. CBD treatment reduced cell viability and initiated apoptotic and necrotic processes in both cancer cell lines in a time and dose-dependent manner, showing acute myeloid leukaemia (HL-60) cells greater sensitivity than chronic myeloid leukaemia ones (K-562), without differences in the activation of caspases 3/7. Then, control and treated cells of HL-60 and K-562 cell lines were studied through an untargeted lipidomic approach. The treatment was carried out with CBD at a concentration of 10 μM for HL-60 cells and 23 µM CBD for K-562 cells for 48 h. After the extraction of the lipid content from cell lysates, the samples were analysed by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS both in the positive and the negative ionization modes. The comprehensive characterization of cellular lipids unveiled several classes significantly affected by CBD treatment. Most of the differences correspond to phospholipids, including cardiolipins (CL), phosphatidylcholines (PC) and phosphosphingolipids (SM), and also triacylglycerols (TG), being many TG species increased after CBD treatment in the acute and chronic models, whereas phospholipids were found to be decreased. The results highlight some important lipid alterations related to CBD treatment, plausibly connected with different metabolic mechanisms involved in the process of cell death by apoptosis in cancer cell lines.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Identifying factors influencing cannabidiol (CBD) exposure can optimize treatment efficacy and safety. We aimed to describe the population pharmacokinetics of CBD in children with drug-resistant developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) and assess the influence of environmental, pharmacological, and clinical characteristics on CBD systemic exposure. METHODS: Data from two pharmacokinetic studies of patients aged 2-18 years with DEEs were included (N = 48 patients). Serial blood samples were collected during maintenance treatment, before and after the morning dose, and up to 6 h after a dose of a purified CBD oil formulation, with or without a normocaloric breakfast. CBD plasma concentrations were also available following administration of a CBD-enriched formulation. Samples were quantified using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay. A CBD population pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The effects of formulation, concomitant food intake, and demographic, clinical, and pharmacological factors on CBD pharmacokinetics were evaluated. Simulated maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve between 0 and 12 h (AUC0-12) were calculated. RESULTS: A one-compartment model with transit compartments and first-order elimination best described CBD pharmacokinetics. Mean values for CBD apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) were 143.5 L/h and 1892.4 L, respectively. Weight was allometrically scaled for V/F and CL/F, sex was associated with V/F, and both formulation and food condition were associated with F (relative bioavailability). CBD Cmax increased by 41% and AUC0-12 by 45% when CBD was administered with food compared to fasting. Dose-normalized AUC0-12 was approximately 50% lower with CBD-enriched oil compared to purified CBD. SIGNIFICANCE: In the present study, we described the effects of food and formulation on CBD exposure in children with DEEs. Increased CBD exposure with food intake and significant changes in drug exposure when switching between CBD formulations should be considered in patient management.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis derivatives are among the most widely used psychoactive substances in the world, which leads to growing medical concerns regarding its chronic use and abuse especially among adolescents. Exposure to THC during formative years produces long-term behavioral alterations that share similarities with symptoms of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we have analyzed the functional and molecular mechanisms that might underlie these alterations. Rat organotypic hippocampal slices were cultured for 2 days (immature) or 10 days (mature) in vitro and then exposed for 7 days to THC (1 µM) or CBD (1 µM). At the end of the treatment, slices were analyzed by Western blotting, electrophysiological recordings, RT-PCR, and fluorescence microscopy to explore the molecular and functional changes in the hippocampus. A prolonged (7-day) exposure to THC reduced the expression levels of pre- (synaptophysin, vGlut1) and post-synaptic (PSD95) proteins in both immature and mature slices, whereas CBD significantly increased the expression levels of PSD95 only in immature slices. In addition, THC significantly reduced the passive properties and the intrinsic excitability of membranes and increased sEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells of immature but not mature slices. Exposure to both cannabinoids impaired mitochondrial function as detected by the reduction of mRNA expression levels of mitobiogenesis genes such as VDAC1, UCP2, and TFAM. Finally, THC but not CBD caused tissue disorganization and morphological modifications in CA1 pyramidal neurons, astrocytes and microglia in both immature and mature slices. These results are helpful to explain the specific vulnerability of adolescent brain to the effects of psychotropic cannabinoids.",

However, it has poor oral bioavailability. We investigated the effect of a novel lipid formulation on its absorption in humans and on its tissue distribution in mice. Methods: In a double-blind crossover study in fasting healthy volunteers, we compared the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 1000 mg of CBD in the lipid formulation and in a powder formulation (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05032807). In a second study, male CD1 mice were administered CBD in either the lipid formulation or dissolved in water, via oral gavage (n = 1 per timepoint). The tissue distribution of CBD was assessed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging. Results: Plasma exposure (AUC0-48) of CBD was nine times greater for the lipid formulation than the powder formulation (611.1 ng·h/mL [coefficient of variation {CV%}: 104.6] and 66.8 ng·h/mL [CV%: 50.7], respectively). With the powder formulation, the AUC0-48 was related to the concentration of specific gastrointestinal bacteria and bile acids. These associations were attenuated with the lipid formulation. In the animal study, after treatment with the lipid formulation, measurable concentrations of CBD were identified in all organs. For the aqueous formulation, tissue concentrations of CBD were below the limit of quantification. Conclusions: Administering oral CBD in a lipid formulation was associated with an increase in its gastrointestinal absorption, as well as an attenuation of the relationship between its absorption and features of the gut microbiome."

(granulated-CHR OR and injectable nanodispersion-CHR IN) in conjunction with a cannabidiol (CBD)-rich extract of Cannabis sativa L. (CSE) on experimental pain models in Wistar rats. Methods: Chemical analysis was performed using gas chromatography (GC-MS). The pain tests employed were acetic acid-induced writhing (injection i.p. of 0.9% acetic acid), formalin (solution 1%), hot plate (55 ± 0.5 °C), and cold-water tail withdrawal tests. Results: Chemical analyses by chromatography confirmed that the oil from B. orellana is rich in δ-tocotrienol (72.0 ± 1.0%), while the oil from Cannabis sativa highlighted the presence of cannabidiol (CBD). The results from the experimental pain tests indicated that the combined administration of formulations containing Bixa orellana and C. sativa, such as the granulated CHR OR (400 mg/kg, orally) with CSE (40 mg/kg, orally) or the nanodispersion CHR IN (10 mg/kg, intramuscularly) with CSE (40 mg/kg, orally), demonstrated significant results (p < 0.001) in pain reduction. Although the formulations containing Bixa orellana extract showed statistical significance in the tests when used in isolation, their effects were inferior compared to the combined use with CSE or the isolated use of CSE. These findings suggest that combining formulations containing extracts of these plant species may represent a viable therapeutic option, considering the synergistic action in reducing pain under the experimental conditions employed. Conclusions: these results imply that combining the phytocomplexes present in B. orellana and C. sativa may be a promising approach for pain treatment."

      "abstract": "Cannabichromene (CBC) is one of the main cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, and although less well known than tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), it is gaining attention for its potential therapeutic benefits. To date, CBC's known mechanisms of action include anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antidepressant, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, and anti-acne effects through TRP channel activation and the inhibition of inflammatory pathways, suggesting that it may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), but its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of CBC on Th2 cytokines along with the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways involved in AD pathogenesis. We used a 2,4-Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced BALB/c mouse model to topically administer CBC (0.1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg). The results showed that skin lesion severity, ear thickness, epithelial thickness of dorsal and ear skin, and mast cell infiltration were significantly reduced in the 0.1 mg/kg CBC-treated group compared with the DNCB-treated group (p < 0.001). In addition, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of Th2 cytokines (TSLP, IL-4, IL-13) and inflammatory mediators (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-33) (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis also revealed a significant decrease in JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, and STAT6 protein expression (p < 0.05). These results suggest that CBC is a promising candidate for the treatment of AD and demonstrates the potential to alleviate AD symptoms by suppressing the Th2 immune response.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol, which is one of the main cannabinoids present in Cannabis sativa plants, has been shown to have therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that may be useful for treatment of various kidney conditions. OBJECTIVES: This article investigates the effect of long-term cannabidiol (CBD) treatment on changes in the renal transcriptome in a mouse model. The main hypothesis was that systematic CBD treatment would affect gene expression associated with those processes in the kidney. METHODS: The study was conducted on male C57BL/6J mice. Mice in the experimental groups received daily intraperitoneal injections of CBD at doses of 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) for 28 days. After the experiment, kidney tissues were collected, RNA was isolated, and RNA-Seq sequencing was performed. RESULTS: The results show CBD's effects on changes in gene expression, including the regulation of genes related to circadian rhythm (e.g., Ciart, Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Per2, and Per3), glucocorticoid receptor function (e.g., Cyp1b1, Ddit4, Foxo3, Gjb2, and Pck1), lipid metabolism (e.g., Cyp2d22, Cyp2d9, Decr2 Hacl1, and Sphk1), and inflammatory response (e.g., Cxcr4 and Ccl28). CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest that CBD may be beneficial for therapeutic purposes in treating kidney disease, and its effects should be further analyzed in clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Painful conditions of the pelvic floor include a set of disorders of the pelvic region, discreetly prevalent in the female population, in which pain emerges as the predominant symptom. Such disorders have a significant impact on quality of life as they impair couple relationships and promote states of anxiety and irascibility in affected individuals. Although numerous treatment approaches have been proposed for the management of such disorders, there is a need to identify strategies to promote muscle relaxation, counter pelvic pain, and reduce inflammation. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) represents a complex system spread throughout the body and is involved in the regulation of numerous physiological processes representing a potential therapeutic target for mood and anxiety disorders as well as pain management. Cannabidiol (CBD), acting on the ECS, can promote relief from hyperalgesia and allodynia typical of disorders affecting the pelvic floor and promote muscle relaxation by restoring balance to this delicate anatomical region. However, its use is currently limited due to a lack of evidence supporting its efficacy and harmlessness, and the mechanism of action on the ECS remains partially unexplored to this day. This comprehensive review of the literature examines the impact of pain disorders affecting the pelvic floor and major treatment approaches and brings together the main evidence supporting CBD in the management of such disorders.",

      "abstract": "Our understanding of the implications of gestational Cannabis exposure (GCE) remains unclear as Cannabis use increases worldwide. Much of the existing knowledge of the effects of GCE has been gained from preclinical experiments using injections of isolated Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at relatively high doses. Few investigations of the effects of GCE to smoke from the whole Cannabis flower have been conducted, despite this being the most common mode of human consumption. Here, we compared the effects of repeated gestational exposure to high-THC or high-cannabidiol (CBD) Cannabis smoke to i.p. THC or i.p. CBD to those of GCE to high-THC or high-CBD Cannabis smoke on litter health and the offspring. We found that injecting phytocannabinoids generally had a more severe impact on measures of maternal and litter health and produced distinct behavioral phenotypes when compared to offspring from dams treated with high-THC and high-CBD smoke during gestation. GCE to high-THC smoke decreased prepulse inhibition (PPI) and MK-801-induced locomotor activity in female adolescent offspring, which normalized in adulthood. GCE to i.p. THC increased exploratory behavior in the open field test in adolescent offspring of both sexes. GCE had a negative impact on offspring performance in the Identical Stimuli Test and Different Stimuli Test with odors regardless of gestational treatment, sex, or age. CBD (i.p) impaired PPI in both male and female offspring in adulthood and increased time spent in proximity during social interaction for male offspring. There were no effects of GCE in the 5 Choice Serial Reaction Time Task. These data establish distinct behavioral phenotypes in the offspring between smoked and injected GCE, further demonstrating that route and specific phytocannabinoid dose produce differential outcomes across offspring lifespan. Smoked Cannabis is still the most common means of consumption, and more preclinical investigation is needed to determine the effects of smoked Cannabis on developmental trajectories.",

      "abstract": "Promising clinical evidence suggests that psychedelic compounds, like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), have therapeutic value for treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, they often produce hallucinations and dissociative states, likely mediated by the serotonin (5-HT) receptor 5-HT2A, raising challenges regarding therapeutic scalability. Given the reported antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol (CBD) and its promiscuous binding at many receptors, we assessed whether CBD could modulate 5-HT2A signalling. Activation of the 5-HT2A intracellular signalling events were assessed using resonance energy transfer- or fluorescence-based biosensors in HEK 293 cells and in rat primary cortical neurons. In 5-HT2A-transfected HEK 293 T cells, CBD antagonized LSD-mediated Gq activation in a saturable way, while leaving β-arrestin2 recruitment unaffected. CBD decreased Gq activation mediated by the 5-HT2A-specific agonist DOI as well as LSD-mediated activity in primary rat neonatal cortical neurons. Using Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) simulations, we also predicted that the putative binding site of CBD overlapped with that of oleamide, a positive allosteric modulator of 5-HT2A, and could displace the binding of orthosteric ligands toward the external binding pocket. Based on these findings, we propose that CBD acts as a negative allosteric modulator of 5-HT2A.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Today more and more people search the web for health-related information, risking to come across misinformation and biased content that may affect their treatment decisions. Cannabidiol (CBD) is among the products for which beneficial effects have been claimed, often at the expense of the risks; further keeping in mind unreliable information reported on products themselves. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the quality of information retrieved by Google on the potential effects of CBD on weight management, also comparing Italian and English contents, hypothesizing generally low quality and language-driven differences in offered information. METHODS: Queries regarding cannabidiol and obesity-related terms were entered into Google, ranking the first 50 webpages from both merged Italian and English results for analysis. RESULTS: Of the outputs, 37 Italian and 27 English websites addressed the topic and were not related to medical literature. As expected, a substantial proportion of information was of low quality, with English sites performing better (29.6%) than Italian ones (54%, p = 0.052) in terms of \"JAMA benchmarks\" for trustworthiness of information. Also, while most English sites were \"Health portals\" (40.7%) with neutral stance toward CBD (74.1%), Italian ones were predominantly \"commercial\" (78.4%, p = 0.001) and promoting CBD use (89.2%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the need for better online information, especially in non-Englishspeaking countries, as scarce and unequal information can lead people to make poor health choices, with potentially harmful consequences."
