      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Circumferential burn of chest (CBC) is a significant type of burn and considers as a major cause of restrictive lung disease (RLD). Patient who has CBC with RLD leads to respiratory symptoms such as breathing difficulty, airway obstruction, reduced exercise capacity and altered pulmonary functions. However, studies examining the role of pranayama breathing exercise on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity and exercise tolerance in full thickness circumferential burn of chest are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To find the short term effects of pranayama breathing exercise on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity and exercise tolerance in full thickness circumferential burns of chest. METHODS: Through simple random sampling method thirty subjects (N = 30) with RLD following CBC were allocated to pranayama breathing exercise group (PBE-G; n = 15) and conventional breathing exercise group (CBE-G; n = 15). They received pranayama breathing exercise and conventional breathing exercise for 4 weeks respectively. All the subjects received chest mobility exercise as common treatment. Primary (Numeric Pain Rating Scale - NPRS, forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and secondary (Electromyogram of sternocleidomastoid, scalene, external intercostal and diaphragm muscle, 6 min walk test & Global Rating of Change - GRC) outcome measures were measured at baseline, after four weeks and after three months follow up. RESULTS: Baseline demographic and clinical variables show homogenous distribution between the groups (p > 0.05). Four weeks following different breathing exercises, PBE-G group shows more significant changes in pain intensity, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity, exercise tolerance and global rating of change than CBE-G group (p ≤ 0.05) at four weeks and three months follow up. CONCLUSION: Both groups showed improvement over time. However, differences between the groups were noticed small. Still physiotherapy management, which included pranayama breathing exercises with chest mobilization program, had an effective strategy in the treatment of restrictive lung disease following circumferential burn of chest.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of pranayama on asthma control, pulmonary function, and quality of life in people with asthma. METHODS: Pranayama was applied to the pranayama group for 20 min once daily for 1 month, and relaxation was applied to the relaxation group similarly in addition to the standard treatment. The outcome measurement tools used were the Asthma Control Test (ACT), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), pulmonary function test (PFT), and patient observation chart. RESULTS: The pranayama group had significantly higher ACT score, overall AQLQ score, and subscale scores than the relaxation group (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of PFT parameters and peak expiratory flow values (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pranayama improved asthma control and asthma-related quality of life in people with asthma, but it did not show a significant difference in PFT values.",

SUBJECTS: One hundred and twenty subjects were randomized to three groups through block randomization. Subjects with an Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score <5.5 participated in the study. SETTING: Outpatient pulmonary medicine department. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects in the Buteyko and pranayama groups were trained for 3-5 days and instructed to practise the exercises for 15 minutes twice daily, and for three months duration. The control group underwent routine pharmacological management during the study period. OUTCOME MEASURES: Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Asthma Control Questionnaire and pulmonary function test. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar in all three groups. Post intervention, the Buteyko group showed better trends of improvement (mean (95% confidence interval), P-value) in total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score than the pranayama (0.47 (-0.008-0.95), P = 0.056) and control groups (0.97 (0.48-1.46), P = 0.0001). In comparison between the pranayama and control groups, pranayama showed significant improvement (0.50 (0.01-0.98), P = 0.042) in total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score. CONCLUSION: The Buteyko group showed better trends of improvement in quality of life and asthma control than the group performing the pranayama breathing exercise.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachyarrhythmias are an important public health problem. QT dispersion (QTd), defined as the difference between maximal and minimal QT intervals, reflects the regional inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization dispersion and may mark the presence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of Pranayama (breathing exercise) on QTd in patients with arrhythmia. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with arrhythmia and ejection fractions <40% (mean = 28 ± 9%) who were on a stable medical regimen. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: Standardized 12-lead surface ECGs were obtained at the beginning and end of the Pranayama session, and QT and JT intervals were measured manually and corrected for heart rate by using Bazett's formula. QTd, heart rate-corrected QTd (QTc-d), JT dispersion (JTd), and heart ratecorrected JTd (JTc-d) were measured in at least eight ECG leads in each patient. RESULTS: Following the Pranayama session, patients with arrhythmia had only slight improvements in exercise capacity (results were not significant). However, these patients had marked improvements in QTd (71 ± 11 to 59 ± 17 ms; P < .02), QTc-d (82 ± 28 to 63 ± 17 ms; P < .01), JTd (76 ± 19 to 57 ± 18 ms; P < .002), and JTc-d (84 ± 23 to 61 ± 18 ms; P < .001) following the Pranayama session. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that Pranayama significantly reduces the indices of ventricular repolarization dispersion in patients with arrhythmia. Further studies are needed to evaluate how effectively this reduction in ventricular repolarization dispersion decreases the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in patients with arrhythmia.",
