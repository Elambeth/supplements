      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nutritional expectations have been shown to influence exercise performance via placebo and nocebo effects. The present study aimed to evaluate performance-enhancement expectations for coffee and energy drinks using the Stanford Expectations of Treatment Scale. METHODS: A total of 402 participants (48.5% male) with an average exercise history of 4.53 years, engaging in average physical activity 3.91 times per week, were included in the study. Data collection was conducted through the Qualtrics platform. RESULTS: Participants exhibited significantly higher positive expectations for coffee compared to energy drinks (p = 0.002), whereas negative expectations were more pronounced for energy drinks than for coffee (p < 0.001). Males and individuals engaging in anaerobic exercise expressed more positive expectations for energy drinks than females and those participating in aerobic or mixed exercise regimens. Additionally, high-frequency exercisers (≥4 sessions per week) reported greater positive expectations for both beverages and fewer negative expectations for coffee than low-frequency exercisers (≤3 sessions per week). Correlational analyses revealed weak but significant associations between expectations and variables such as exercise history, frequency, intensity, and age. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that coffee is perceived as a more effective performance enhancer and exhibits greater placebo-inducing potential than energy drinks, which may elicit stronger nocebo effects. These group-specific perceptions should be considered by trainers, coaches, and researchers when addressing placebo-nocebo mechanisms in the context of sports and exercise.",

      "abstract": "ISSUE ADDRESSED: Effective interventions to reduce energy drink (ED) consumption are needed. This study explored the effect of warning labels on intentions to reduce ED consumption, perceived label effectiveness and protection motivation theory (PMT) constructs. METHODS: Australian ED consumers aged 18 to 39 years (N = 343) participated in an experimental online survey, randomly assigned to view one of three ED warning label conditions (weight gain, cardiac effects, no label-control). Intentions to reduce ED consumption, perceived effectiveness of labels and selected PMT constructs were assessed. RESULTS: Participants reported moderate-high awareness of the health effects of consumption (62.68%) and advisory statements on EDs (69.39%), including daily consumption limits (48.40%). EDs were consumed frequently, with 56.26% regular (at least weekly) consumers and most commonly for functional benefits (e.g., alertness). ED warning labels did not have a statistically significant effect on intentions to reduce consumption. The cardiac label performed better than the weight gain label in 'grabbed attention' (72.97% vs. 55.66%, p = 0.008), with non-significant trends (p > 0.05, absolute differences ≥ 10%) suggesting it was stronger on some other perceived effectiveness measures. Supplementary analyses indicated females in the cardiac condition reported greater intentions to reduce ED consumption than females in the control condition (p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Graphic warning labels and labels warning of cardiac effects are worthy of further exploration as a potential intervention to reduce ED consumption. SO WHAT?: Future research should explore the motivations underlying ED consumption and further explore messages that will resonate with consumers.",

Sixteen male rats were divided into four groups, each consisting of four rats. The control group was given water and rat feed, while groups 1, 2, and 3 were given water with Tiger energy drink (25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) for eight weeks. The results showed that the effect of energy drinks on lipid profile decreased cholesterol, TG, and LDL, while there was a slight increase in HDL. Treatment with wild Tiger energy drink generally caused insignificant increases in GOT and GPT in both G2 and G3 groups as compared to the control. However, in the G1 group, GPT and GOT significantly increased. Accordingly, ALP concentration was significantly increased in all experimental groups compared to the control group. Sperm quality declined as the concentration of energy drinks consumed increased. The potential adverse effects of energy drinks, at their specific dosages, have been determined to include hepatic and renal impairment, as well as alterations in serum lipids. Additional research is required to investigate the specific mechanism by which energy drinks impact spermatogenesis, either through the modulation of endocrine hormones or other metabolic pathways.",

      "abstract": "This cross-sectional study highlights the concerning relationship between stimulants, alcohol use, and weight-related problems among Palestinian refugee men in the West Bank. Self-administered questionnaires were used to gather data on stimulants and alcohol use and eating attitudes and behaviors (EAT-26). The findings revealed that many refugee men were daily cigarette (61.4%) and waterpipe smokers (15.5%), while 30.6% and 2.3% were daily energy drink and alcohol users, respectively. Moreover, most refugee men (67.3%) were obese, and 23.5% were terrified about being obese. They had disordered eating habits, including the impulse to vomit after meals (63.3%). Moreover, 30.7% scored ≥20 using EAT-26 scale, and 44.4% scored at least one positive behavior, including binge eating (40.4%), purging (10.0%), using laxatives or diet pills (8.3%), excessive exercise (30.9%), and losing weight (24.6%). The results of the adjusted binary logistic regression indicated that risk factors associated with self-induced vomiting were daily (OR = 2.71, p-value = 0.004) and weekly energy drink intake (OR = 2.41, p-value = 0.023), weekly alcohol intake (OR = 10.83, p-value = 0.036), and obesity (OR = 2.57, p-value = 0.002), while inversely associated with weekly waterpipe smoking (OR = 0.297, p-value = 0.007). Obesity was inversely associated with daily (OR = 0.146, p-value < 0.01) and weekly waterpipe smoking (OR = 0.259, p-value = 0.002), and weekly cigarette smoking (OR = 0.251, p-value < 0.01). The study underscores the urgent need for community awareness, professional evaluation, and treatment for obesity and disordered eating habits among Palestinian refugee men. It is essential to address the detrimental effects of alcohol and energy drink intake and tobacco smoking to improve the health outcomes of this vulnerable population."

      "abstract": "Many studies raised concerns on alcoholic beverages consumption mixed with energy drinks (AmED), which can induce higher rates of binge drinking and earlier development of alcohol use disorders. After 20 years of research, few studies with laboratory animals have focused on the effects of this mixture and the neurobiological and pharmacological mechanisms underlying them. We found 16 articles on AmED administration to rodents evaluating its effects on voluntary consumption, locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, memory, influence on the onset time of seizures, biochemical and neurochemical measures. Some of these studies indicated energy drinks (ED) can alter the pattern of use and motivation to consume ethanol (EtOH); increase the expression of sensitization to EtOH stimulant effect and the proportion of sensitized mice; decrease the aversiveness of high concentrations of EtOH, among other effects. In addition AmED hastens the loss of righting reflex and its effects on memory are controversial. After acute administration no difference was found in blood ethanol concentration (BEC) of rodents which received EtOH with or without ED, but after 60 days of treatment, AmED group had lower BEC levels than EtOH group. Data on biochemical and neurochemical parameters after AmED are not consistent. Although the AmED group presented higher glucose levels than the EtOH group when drugs were administered by gavage, this was not observed in a self-administration protocol. AmED may induce higher kidney damage, higher levels of plasma urea, uric acid and creatinine when compared to EtOH. Chronic consumption of AmED causes an inflammatory response and oxidative stress, which may induce cell death in the cortex and hypothalamus of adult rats. These controversial results show that AmED diverse effects depend on sex, age and lineage of the animals, duration of the treatment and route of administration. Further research is necessary to evaluate the mechanisms underlying AmED biological effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several case reports have suggested an increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to energy drinks. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess acute electrophysiologic effects of caffeine and taurine, two of the main ingredients of energy drinks, in an experimental whole-heart model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five rabbit hearts were excised, retrogradely perfused, and assigned to two groups. Hearts were perfused with caffeine (2, 10, and 50 µM) or taurine (2, 10, and 50 µM) after generating baseline data. Eight monophasic action potentials and electrocardiography recordings showed a significant abbreviation of action potential duration (APD90 ), QT interval, and effective refractory periods (ERP) after caffeine treatment. With taurine, cardiac repolarization duration and ERP were significantly shortened. A ventricular vulnerability was assessed by a predefined pacing protocol. With caffeine, we observed a trend towards more ventricular arrhythmias in a dose-dependent manner. After treatment with taurine, significantly more episodes of ventricular arrhythmias occurred. CONCLUSION: In this experimental whole-heart study, treatment with caffeine and taurine provoked ventricular arrhythmias. The underlying mechanism was an abbreviation of cardiac repolarizations and effective refractory periods that may facilitate re-entry and thereby provokes arrhythmias. These findings help to understand the potentially hazardous and fatal outcomes after intoxication with energy drinks.",

The extensive use of EDs also affects the sleep and exercise of adolescents. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the consumption of EDs, the knowledge, attitude towards EDs and associated factors of EDs consumption among adolescents in Shanghai, China. METHODS: A total of 4608 adolescents completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing EDs use history, knowledge and attitude towards EDs. Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC) was used to assess their life events. All participants were divided into two groups based on whether they used them or not. t-test and χ2 test were used to compare the differences between the two groups, and binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the related factors for EDs consumption. RESULTS: 70.5% of the participants reported having ever used EDs. The main avenues to getting information on EDs were from advertisements. 67.56% of them believed that EDs had adverse effects on health. 22.09% of the participants and 31.55% of their parents took a negative attitude towards EDs. Compared with the non-consumption group, participants in the consumption group were likely to be male, with older age, identified EDs more correctly and did not believe EDs had adverse effects, with more positive attitude and higher ASLEC score. Logistic regression results showed that gender, age, attitude of parents and themselves, knowledge of EDs and ASLEC score significantly predicted EDs consumption. CONCLUSION: EDs consumption was popular among adolescents in Shanghai, and the tailored intervention programmes need to be developed based on the characteristics of adolescents."

Chronic ingestion of energy drinks may potentially regulate vascular risk factors. This study investigated the effects of chronic ingestion of energy drinks on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and neuroinflammation. Male C57BL/6J mice were maintained on water (control), MotherTM (ED), sugar-free MotherTM (sfED), or Coca ColaTM soft drink (SD) for 13 weeks. The BBB integrity and neuroinflammation were analyzed with semi-quantitative immunofluorescent microscopy. Blood pressure, plasma inflammatory cytokine levels and blood glucose were also considered. Following 13 weeks of intervention, mice treated with ED, sfED, and SD showed significant disruption of BBB. However, marked neuroinflammation was observed only in sfED group mice. The consumption of ED and sfED significantly altered the blood pressure and plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-a, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, and both increased plasma glucose. Correlation analyses showed significant associations between BBB dysfunction and hypotension, hyperglycaemia and cytokine dyshomeostasis. The intake of energy drink, particularly the sugar free formulation, may compromise the integrity of BBB and induce neuroinflammation via hypotension, hyperglycaemia and inflammatory pathways."

The putative effects of chronic ingestion of either standard energy drink, MotherTM (ED), or its sugar-free formulation (sfED) on metabolic syndrome were determined in wild-type C57BL/6J mice, in comparison to a soft drink, Coca-Cola (SD), a Western-styled diet enriched in saturated fatty acids (SFA), and a combination of SFA + ED. Following 13 weeks of intervention, mice treated with ED were hyperglycaemic and hypertriglyceridaemic, indicating higher triglyceride glucose index, which was similar to the mice maintained on SD. Surprisingly, the mice maintained on sfED also showed signs of insulin resistance with hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and greater triglyceride glucose index, comparable to the ED group mice. In addition, the ED mice had greater adiposity primarily due to the increase in white adipose tissue, although the body weight was comparable to the control mice receiving only water. The mice maintained on SFA diet exhibited significantly greater weight gain, body fat, cholesterol and insulin, whilst blood glucose and triglyceride concentrations remained comparable to the control mice. Collectively, these data suggest that the consumption of both standard and sugar-free forms of energy drinks induces metabolic syndrome, particularly insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The neurotoxic effects of food additives used in energy drinks have been investigated since the 1900s but safety concerns are rising and reassurance via safety testing in animals is demanded by the public. Rigorous safety testing is performed for dose optimisation and duration of treatment and to detect the methods to assess changes in mood and behaviour. Hence, we studied the neurobehavioral effects of selected food additives used in energy drinks and their combination in rats when consumed in high doses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Young Sprague Dawley rats were divided into six groups. Group 1 was treated with the vehicle, group 2 was treated with 25 mg/kg p.o. caffeine, group 3 was treated with 5 mg/kg p.o. glucuronolactone, group 4 was treated with 8 mg/kg p.o. taurine, group 5 was treated with 84 mg/kg p.o. gluconolactone, and group 6 was treated with a combination of the three food additives. Neurobehavioral changes were evaluated on days 7, 14, and 21 using behavioural parameters. Neurobehavioral scoring and neurotransmitter estimation in rat brain tissue was performed on day 21. RESULTS: Significant changes were observed in the neurobehavioral parameters and neurobehavioural scoring in group 4 and group 6, compared with the control group (p<0.001). Furthermore, the significant decreases in neurotransmitter levels in the brains of rats that were treated with food additives indicated the neurotoxic effects of these substances. CONCLUSION: This study elaborated the neurobehavioral effects of selected food additives, namely glucuronolactone, taurine, and gluconolactone, when administered orally for 21 days in young rats. The highest toxic effects, including alterations in neurotransmitter levels, were observed in animals treated with a combination of food additives at high doses."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Energy drinks are a popular mixer with alcohol among college-aged young adults. Few studies to date have examined the relationships between expectancies of alcohol mixed with energy drink (AmED) use, AmED use and AmED-related negative consequences. METHODS: Eighty college-aged young adults were surveyed regarding their alcohol and AmED use, related negative consequences and AmED expectancies. Associations were assessed using chi-square tests and Cramér's V. A simple mediational model also was used to explore the potential relationships between AmED expectancies, AmED use and AmED-related negative consequences. RESULTS: AmED use was associated with more types of related negative consequences than heavy alcohol use alone, and where AmED use and heavy alcohol use were mutually associated with a related negative consequence, the strength of association was stronger for AmED use. While several AmED-related negative consequences were associated with AmED expectancies, unwanted sexual contact and getting into a verbal argument were associated with the greatest number of expectancies. The mediational model identified a statistically significant indirect effect of AmED expectancies on AmED-related negative consequences mediated by AmED use. CONCLUSIONS: The study results contribute to the evidence that AmED use may confer additional risk for related negative consequences beyond heavy alcohol use and suggest that AmED expectancies may have a role in AmED use, which, in turn, is associated with AmED-related negative consequences. AmED expectancies may be targets for intervention to reduce AmED use considering the possible subsequent related negative consequences, especially those involving negative interpersonal experiences."

      "abstract": "The current study investigated the independent and combined effects of caffeine and taurine on anxiety-like behavior and neuroendocrine responses in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylpurine-2,6-dione), the world's most commonly used psychoactive drug, acts as an adenosine receptor blocker and a mild central nervous system stimulant. However, excessive use of caffeine is associated with heightened anxiety levels. Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), a semi-essential amino acid synthesized within the human brain, has been hypothesized to play a role in regulating anxiolytic behavior. Caffeine and taurine are two common additives in energy drinks and are often found in high concentrations in these beverages. However, few studies have investigated the interaction of these two chemicals with regards to anxiety measures. A suitable vertebrate to examine anxiety-like behavior and physiological stress responses is the zebrafish, which has shown promise due to substantial physiological and genetic homology with humans. Anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish can be determined by analyzing habituation to novelty when fish are placed into a novel tank and scototaxis (light avoidance) behavior in the light-dark test. Stress-related neuroendocrine responses can be measured in zebrafish by analyzing whole-body cortisol levels. The goal of this study was to determine if exposure to caffeine, taurine, or a combination of the two compounds altered anxiety-like behavior and whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish relative to control. Zebrafish were individually exposed to either caffeine (100 mg/L), taurine (400 mg/L), or both for 15 min. Zebrafish in the control group were handled in the same manner but were only exposed to system tank water. After treatment, fish were transferred to the novel tank test or the light-dark test. Behavior was tracked for the first 6 min in the novel tank and 15 min in the light-tark test. Fifteen min after introduction to the behavioral task, fish were euthanized for the analysis of whole-body cortisol levels. The results demonstrate that caffeine treatment decreased the amount of exploration in the top of the novel tank and increased scototaxis behavior in the light-dark test, which supports the established anxiogenic effect of acute exposure to caffeine. Taurine alone did not alter basal levels of anxiety-like behavioral responses nor ameliorated the anxiogenic effects of caffeine on behavior when the two compounds were administered concurrently. None of the drug treatments altered basal levels of whole-body cortisol. The current results of this study suggest that, at least at this dose and time of exposure, taurine does not mitigate the anxiety-producing effects of caffeine when administered in combination, such as with energy drink consumption."

The identified intervention studies primarily investigated acute ED effects in young healthy adults. Moderate consumption of EDs corresponding to an acute caffeine intake of up to 200 mg did not result in clinically relevant cardiovascular changes in young healthy adults. However, high intake of EDs (about 1 L) was associated with moderate to severe adverse effects in some participants (i.a. prolonged QTc interval, palpitations). Studies have indicated that on some occasions, a substantial proportion of ED consuming children and adolescents (12% in 16 EU Member States) drink EDs in high quantities (≥1 L). This could pose a possible health risk to this group since adverse effects by such high ED consumption have been observed already in young healthy adults. Among further measures that might be considered to minimize this identified risk, policy makers could develop information and educational programs with the aim of raising public awareness.",

AIMS: The aim of the present research was to examine associations between consumption of energy drinks, caffeine and junk food, and academic attainment in a sample of UK secondary school students. METHODS: A total of 3071 students agreed to participate in the study; 2677 completed the survey on one occasion (52.4% female, 47.6% male; approximately 20% of the sample from each school year) and 1660 (49.6% female, 50.4% male) completed the survey a second time, approximately six months later. The academic attainment measure was based on Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 grades for Maths and English. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analyses, logistic regressions showed that consumption of energy drinks was associated with a greater likelihood of being in the low academic achievement group. This was not found for other sources of caffeine. The effect of energy drinks was still significant when demographic, academic and health/lifestyle variables were covaried. However, inclusion of an unhealthy diet variable (junk food) removed the significant effect of energy drinks. Similar observations were made in the longitudinal study, with the poorer attainment of those who consumed energy drinks reflecting breakfast omission and depression. DISCUSSION: The present findings indicate that consumption of energy drinks is associated with an increased likelihood of poor academic attainment that reflects energy drink consumption being part of an unhealthy diet or being associated with skipping breakfast rather than a more specific effect, such as being a source of caffeine. Although the current study extends previous research by utilising a longitudinal design, intervention studies are now required to better answer questions relating to causality and direction of effect.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Energy drinks (EDs) have become an integral part of the young adult, athletic, and military culture. Many athletes are convinced that EDs enhance performance, and service members as well as college students frequently use EDs as stimulants to counter sleep deprivation, or to improve academic performance. However, concerns have been raised by some military leaders about potential adverse effects of EDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A needs assessment survey of a convenience sample of military health care providers was conducted and identified EDs as a top knowledge need for those providers working in the area of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The instrument demonstrated high interitem consistency (Cronbach's α > .80). To further explore the state of knowledge on EDs, and to prompt further discussion of ED use and how it may related to military treatment protocols and supporting educational products, we conducted a literature review of English language publications listed in the National Library of Medicine using the search term \"energy drinks\" and published during the last 5 years to determine what is known about EDs in terms of their potential benefits and health risks. RESULTS: The active ingredients in most EDs are caffeine, and to a lesser extent taurine and sugars. Several reports suggest that the combination of these ingredients is more active than the caffeine alone. Despite the positive attributes of EDs, there are increasing reports of serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. Most recently there also has been a dramatic increase in the use of ED/alcohol combination drinks, and there are preliminary studies that suggest important adverse effects with this combination. A 2013 National Institutes of Health expert workshop concluded that more clinical studies are needed to clearly define the health risks associated with ED use. CONCLUSION: The needs assessment points to a desire for more ED knowledge of health providers working with TBI patients. A few key themes emerged from the exploratory literature review that can be taken into consideration when educating health providers and delivering knowledge-based resources. Adverse effects of EDs are most closely associated with the dose of caffeine consumed. In general, the combination of ED with alcohol should be avoided because the ED can mask the level of intoxication, and the combination may be associated with increased risk-taking behavior. Overall, the risks and benefits of EDs remain controversial and good-quality long-term clinical trials are needed to inform policymaking, regulation, and the development of prevention and treatment resources.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to evaluate changes in the contractile behavior of human myocardium after exposure to caffeine and taurine, the main active ingredients of energy drinks (EDs), and to evaluate whether taurine exhibits any inotropic effect at all in the dosages commonly used in EDs. METHODS: Myocardial tissue was removed from the right atrial appendages of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and prepared to obtain specimens measuring 4 mm in length. A total of 92 specimens were exposed to electrical impulses at a frequency of 75 bpm for at least 40 min to elicit their maximum contractile force before measuring the isometric contractile force (ICF) and duration of contraction (CD). Following this, each specimen was treated with either taurine (group 1, n = 29), or caffeine (group 2, n = 31) or both (group 3, n = 32). After exposure, ICF and CD measuring were repeated. Post-treatment values were compared with pre-treatments values and indicated as percentages. RESULTS: Exposure to taurine did not alter the contraction behavior of the specimens. Exposure to caffeine, in contrast, led to a significant increase in ICF (118 ± 03%, p < 0.01) und a marginal decrease in CD (95 ± 1.6%, p < 0.01). Exposure to a combination of caffeine and taurine also induced a statistically significant increase in ICF (124 ± 4%, p < 0.01) and a subtle reduction in CD (92 ± 1.4%, p < 0.01). The increase in ICF achieved by administration of caffeine was similar to that achieved by a combination of both caffeine and taurine (p = 0.2). The relative ICF levels achieved by administration of caffeine and a combination of taurine and caffeine, respectively, were both significantly higher (p < 0.01) than the ICF resulting from exposure to taurine only. CONCLUSION: While caffeine altered the contraction behavior of the specimen significantly in our in-vitro model, taurine did not exhibit a significant effect. Adding taurine to caffeine did not significantly enhance or reduce the effect of caffeine.",

ECG showed AF with high ventricular response (135-170 bpm range frequency). Anamnestic record reported a high consumption of EDs during the previous 8 h from the onset of AF. In one case ED was associated with a moderate quantity of alcohol. Patients were successfully cardioverted both spontaneously and after pharmacological treatment. After cardioversion: the ECG and echocardiogram appeared normal in all patients; the toxicological tests and the laboratory analyses resulted negative. Our experience suggests that larger consumption of EDs, especially when combined with alcoholic beverages, could act as a trigger in the development of AF in young patients. This action may be caused by the synergic effect of caffeine and other substances present in EDs. Following the increasing consumption of EDs in young people, we suggest a careful attention to cardiac complications.",

The study provides a summary and critical analysis of the current literature. METHOD: The review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Studies included in the review were those that quantified the relationship between AmED use and injury risk relative to alcohol only. Records were considered along the following theme areas: controlled for drinking behaviors, controlled for impulsivity or risk-taking propensity, examined sex differences, and self-reported injury outcomes for (a) AmED versus alcohol consumers and (b) AmED versus alcohol sessions. RESULTS: The results support the association between AmED and increased risk of injury; however, substantial variability in harm outcomes and methodology makes it difficult to determine the extent of this risk. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant need for further examination of the role of AmED use in the risk of injury. A better understanding of the relationship between AmED use and injury and of the potential underlying mechanisms is crucial for informing effective preventive intervention strategies. This review can be used to inform the public and health practitioners of the risks associated with AmED use. Further, translating this knowledge to policy makers could inform regulations on the availability of AmED, with the goal of reducing injury-related outcomes.",

METHODS: Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests and logistic regression analyses were used to determine differences in non-medical prescription stimulant use by students who used alcohol-only versus AmED and to identify covariates of non-medical prescription stimulant use. Pearson-product moment coefficients were used to determine strength of variable relationships. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in frequency of Ritalin (p < .001, Cohen's d = .23) and Adderall (p < .001, Cohen's d = .32) use between alcohol-only students and AmED students. Greater frequency of AmED use was also associated with greater frequency of Ritalin use (r = .293, p < .001) and Adderall use (r = .353, p < .001). Males (b = .138, OR = 1.148) were more likely to use prescription stimulants non-medically than females. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need to better understand influences on non-medical prescription stimulant, energy drink and AmED use, as the combined effects of stimulants contained in energy drinks and the depressant effects of alcohol appear to be associated with increased non-medical prescription stimulant use. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Research on the influential factors related to energy drinks, alcohol, and non-medical prescription stimulants will help practitioners to more appropriately design prevention and intervention strategies addressing these high-risk behaviors.

      "abstract": "Background: Concerns have been expressed regarding the potential for caffeinated energy drinks to negatively affect mental health, and particularly so in young consumers at whom they are often targeted. The products are frequently marketed with declarations of increasing mental and physical energy, providing a short-term boost to mood and performance. Although a certain amount of evidence has accumulated to substantiate some of these claims, the chronic effects of energy drinks on mental health also need to be addressed. Methods: To review the relevant literature, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for all peer-reviewed articles published in English that addressed associations between energy drink use and mental health outcomes. Case reports were also considered, though empirical studies investigating acute mood effects were excluded as a review of such articles had recently been published. Fifty-six articles were retrieved: 20 of these (along with eight more identified through other means) were included in the current review, and, because the majority addressed aspects of stress, anxiety, and depression, particular focus was placed on these outcomes. Results: Though a number of null findings (and one negative relationship) were observed, the majority of studies examined reported positive associations between energy drink consumption and symptoms of mental health problems. Conclusions: Though the findings imply that energy drink use may increase the risk of undesirable mental health outcomes, the majority of research examined utilized cross-sectional designs. In most cases, it was therefore not possible to determine causation or direction of effect. For this reason, longitudinal and intervention studies are required to increase our understanding of the nature of the relationships observed."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Predictors of use of alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AmED) among youth have been understudied. The current analyses investigated the prevalence of and correlates for use of AmED among alcohol users from a national study of stimulant use among youth. METHODS: The National Monitoring of Adolescent Prescription Stimulants Study (N-MAPSS) assessed behaviors and risk factors for stimulant use from 11,048 youth, 10-18 years of age recruited from entertainment venues across 10 US cities. Of the four cross sections, two had questions on having alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AmED) in the past 30 days along with sociodemographic characteristics, current tobacco and marijuana use and current nonmedical use of prescription opioids, anxiolytics, and stimulants. Only 13 to18 year olds and those who reported alcohol use were included in the analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 28.4% (1392 out of 4905) of the 13 to18 year olds reported past 30-day alcohol use. Among alcohol users, 27% reported having alcohol mixed with energy drinks in the past 30 days. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that use of AmED was significantly associated with tobacco and marijuana use and nonmedical use of prescription stimulants. CONCLUSIONS: Underage drinking is common among youth and more than a quarter of these drinkers use AmED. Use of AmED is significantly associated with tobacco and marijuana use and nonmedical use of prescription stimulants. Drug and alcohol intervention programs should educate on the risks of AmED, as the same population is at high-risk for use of AmED and alcohol/drug use.",

However, no previous study has addressed the symbolic effect of energy drinks on pain tolerance, that is, a particular masculine characteristic. We conducted a priming-based experiment to show that energy drink primes elevated men's pain tolerance. Induced conformity to masculinity norms mediated the priming effect of energy drinks on pain tolerance. These findings suggest that mere reminders of masculinity-related products can lead men to behave accordingly in seemingly irrelevant domains (i.e., pain tolerance). Besides distraction and placebo treatment, the connection between a symbolic masculinity prime and greater tolerance of pain may shed lights on an alternative route for pain control.",

METHODS: Students completed a cross-sectional survey with questions regarding AmED use. RESULTS: AmED use in the last 30 days was reported by 27% of participants. Logistic regression analyses found that risk factors for AmED included participating in a fraternity/sorority; participating in athletics; living off-campus; having greater fun/social, relax, and image motives for alcohol consumption; and binge drinking. Protective factors included early morning classes, honors program participation, and greater physical/behavioral motives for not drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for AmED use can identify college students most likely to consume AmEDs and thereby inform screening and intervention efforts to reduce negative AmED-related consequences.",

Study results concerning increased health risks of AED consumption relative to alcohol alone have been inconsistent, and the risk for potential work-related injury or disease has not been studied. Our study goal was to evaluate the association between AED consumption and work-related injury or disease in manual workers in Taiwan. METHODS: National survey data of the working population in 2007 was utilized. A total of 1192 manual workers, who drank alcohol more than once per week, were divided into AED-drinkers and non-AED drinkers. We compared AED drinking behaviors and risk of work-related injury or disease between the two groups. RESULTS: AED drinkers had a higher risk of work-related injury or disease, with an odds ratio of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.14-1.93), after controlling demographic, smoking and drinking characteristics. The presence of problem drinking (defined by CAGE score equal to or higher than two) was another risk factor of having work-related injury or disease. Compared to non-AED counterparts, AED drinkers had a significantly higher prevalence of work-related injury or disease in the strata of CAGE score of 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: AED consumers presented increased risks of work-related injury or disease compared with non-AED drinkers among manual workers in Taiwan. In order to conduct an effective intervention program to protect Taiwanese manual workers from potential risks, the reasons for this increased risk among AED drinkers need to be further studied.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of three popular kinds of energy drinks (Power Horse, Red Bull and Code Red) on certain hematological parameters and on the ultrastructure of blood cells in male Wistar albino rats. Animals were treated orally with Power Horse, Red Bull and Code Red respectively for 4 weeks. Blood samples were taken after two and four weeks for determination of haematological indices. Ultrastructure examination of blood cells was carried only after 4 weeks of treatment. The results indicated significant reduction (P < 0.05) in red blood cell count, haemoglobin content, haematocrit value, blood platelets count and neutrophils in animals treated with Red Bull and Power Horse and these changes were time dependant. Insignificant changes were recorded in rats administered with Code Red. On the other hand, ultrastructural alterations, including both nucleus and cytoplasm of peripheral blood cells, were recorded in all treated animals but they were more pronounced in animals received Red Bull and Power Horse. It is concluded that energy drinks have serious detrimental impacts on haematopoietic system of male rats.",

METHODS: Twenty male albino rats weighing 160-180g were assigned into groups A-E of four rats per group. Group A and B rats were given low and high doses of ED, respectively, groups C and D were administered low and high doses of EDmA, respectively while group E rats were given distilled water and served as control. The treatment lasted for 30 days after which the animals were killed and their blood collected for laboratory analyses using standard methods. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in body weight, packed cell volume and haemoglobin concentration with either administration of ED or EDmA in comparison to the control. Energy drink alone or EDmA has significant effects on total white blood cell count, plasma potassium, calcium, renal functions, liver enzymes and plasma triglycerides, with EDmA having more effects than ED alone, except for body weight where the energy drink alone has higher effect. CONCLUSION: Consumption of energy drink alone or in combination with alcohol is associated with significant alterations in some biochemical parameters. Caution should be exercised while consuming either of them. Public health education is urgently needed to correct the wrong impression already formed by the unsuspecting consumers, especially the youths."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While several researchers have proposed a causal relationship between alcohol mixed with energy drink (AmED) consumption and subsequent alcohol intake, there is a dearth of research exploring the potential mechanisms underpinning this association. METHODS: Marczinski and colleagues (in press) report the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-groups study assessing whether an initial AmED dose primes an increased motivation to drink relative to alcohol alone. Participants (n = 80) received either alcohol (0.91 ml/kg vodka), energy drink (ED; 1.82 ml/kg Red Bull(®) ), AmED, or a placebo beverage and then self-reported their motivation to drink via the Desire-for-Drug scale. RESULTS: Subjective ratings of \"desire more alcohol\" were significantly higher than predrink in the placebo, alcohol, and AmED conditions, with this effect apparent at more time points in the AmED condition. While it was concluded that EDs may increase alcohol priming, between-condition analyses revealed that ratings did not differ significantly in AmED and alcohol conditions, with moderate magnitude treatment effects at most, and ratings of desire generally closer to 0 (absence of desire) than 100 (very much desire). CONCLUSIONS: While the study by Marczinski and colleagues fills an important gap in the literature, direct measurement of AmED priming's effect on subsequent alcohol consumption using a within-subjects design and appropriate statistical comparison is required to (i) establish the practical implications of these results for AmED consumers and (ii) discount any individual differences in such priming effects.",

Consequently, it is reported that young adults and college athletes consume energy drinks frequently. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of energy drink consumption among student-athletes selected from seven public universities in Ghana. The study assessed the energy drink consumption patterns, types usually consumed, frequency of consumption and reasons why athletes consumed energy drinks. METHODS: A total number of 180 student-athletes gave their consent to participate in the study and completed a questionnaire which was administered during an inter-university sports competition. RESULTS: Most of the participants (62.2%) reported consuming at least one can of energy drink in a week. A high proportion (53.6%) of the respondents who drink energy drinks indicated that they did so to replenish lost energy after training or a competition. Other reasons given as to why energy drinks were consumed by the study participants included to provide energy and fluids to the body (25.9%), to improve performance (9.8%) and to reduce fatigue (5.4%). CONCLUSION: These results suggest the need to plan health education programmes to particularly correct some wrong perceptions that athletes have regarding the benefits of energy drinks and also create awareness among student-athletes about the side effects of excessive intake of energy drinks."

The method is a direct competitive type format involving the immobilization of vitamin B(12) antibody on nitrocellulose membrane (NC) followed by treatment with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12)-alkaline phosphatase conjugate to facilitate the competitive binding. The dipstick was further treated with substrate disodium 2-chloro-5-(4-methoxyspiro {1,2-dioxetane-3,2¢-(5¢-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)-1-phenyl phosphate (CDP-Star) to generate chemiluminescence (CL). The number of photons generated was inversely proportional to the vitamin B(12) concentration. After systematic optimization, the limit of detection was 1 ng mL(-1). The coefficient of variation was below 0.2% for both intra- and inter-assay precision. Vitamin B(12) was extracted from energy drinks with recovery ranged from 90 to 99.4%. Two different energy drinks samples were analyzed, and a good correlation was observed when the data were compared with a reference enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) method. The developed method is suitable for an accurate, sensitive, and high-throughput screening of vitamin B(12) in energy drinks samples. The dipstick technique based on immuno-CL is suitable for the detection of several analyte in food and environmental samples.",

Energy drinks have particularly high levels of caffeine content and have previously been shown to induce psychotic relapse. Clinical observations of three bipolar disorder patients with comorbid substance use disorder revealed an excessive consumption of energy drinks prior to manic or depressive relapse. BACKGROUND:   Three patients with bipolar spectrum disorder and comorbid substance use disorder were assessed by a psychiatrist upon re-admission to a rehabilitation centre following manic or depressive relapse. The assessment was based on DSM-IV criteria and performed by a psychiatrist who specialized in bipolar spectrum disorder and comorbidities to determine the presence of manic or depressive relapse. Two patients were diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I, and the third with bipolar disorder type II. All three patients were diagnosed with comorbid substance use disorders and all three abused cocaine. RESULTS:   In all three cases, relapse occurred following at least one week of excessive binging on energy drinks, with a maximum daily consumption of nine cans. Following cessation of energy drink consumption, two of the patients remained abstinent from drug use and maintained psychiatric stability. One patient relapsed three months post-treatment and resumed consuming cocaine and energy drinks. CONCLUSIONS:   These clinical observations support other case reports that suggest the existence of a potential correlation between excessive energy drink consumption and relapse among psychiatric populations.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effect of carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, bottled and tap water, on the erosive potential of dental enamel with and without fluoride varnish protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Beverages used in this study included: Coca Cola Classic, Diet Coke, Gatorade sports drink, Red Bull high-energy drink, Starbucks Frappuccino coffee drink, Dasani water (bottled), and tap water (control). Enamel surfaces were coated with Cavity Shield 5% sodium fluoride treatment varnish. Twenty-eight previously extracted human posterior teeth free of hypocalcification and caries were used in this study. The coronal portion of each tooth was removed and then sectioned transverse from the buccal to lingual surface using a diamond coated saw blade. The crown sections were embedded in acrylic resin blocks leaving the enamel surfaces exposed. The enamel surfaces were polished using 600 to 2000 grit abrasive paper and diamond paste. Test specimens were randomly distributed to seven beverage groups and comprised 4 specimens per group. Two specimens per beverage group were treated with a fluoride varnish while 2 specimens did not receive fluoride coating. Surface roughness (profilometer) readings were performed at baseline (prior to fluoride treatment and immersion in the beverage) and again, following immersion for 14 days (24 hours/day). The test beverages were changed daily and the enamel specimens were immersed at 37 degrees C. Surface roughness data was evaluated using multiple factor ANOVA at a significance level of p<0.05. RESULTS: Results showed that Coca-Cola Classic, Gatorade and Red Bull with/without fluoride revealed the highest post-treatment surface roughness measurements. Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke, Gatorade, and Red Bull all showed significantly higher post treatment readings than StarBucks coffee, Dasani water, and tap water. Fluoride varnish was not a significant impact factor; however, beverage (type) and exposure time were significant impact variables. CONCLUSION: Both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages displayed a significant erosive effect on dental enamel; however, fluoride varnish treatments did not demonstrate a significant protective influence on enamel surfaces.",
