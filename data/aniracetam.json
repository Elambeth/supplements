      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 8-12% of children globally. Hyperactivity-related behaviors, as well as inattention and impulsivity, are regarded as the nuclear symptoms of ADHD. At present, its etiologies and risk factors are unknown. Previous research linked TARP γ-8 deficiency to ADHD-like behaviors in mice, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, and memory deficits. Aniracetam, a nootropic drug, enhances cognition by modulating cholinergic activity and glutamate receptors, offering neuroprotective effects. This study examined TARP γ-8 knockout (KO) mice at 4 and 8 weeks, assessing behaviors through locomotor activity, cliff avoidance, novel object recognition, and contextual fear conditioning tests. TARP γ-8 KO mice exhibited hyperactivity, reduced recognition memory, and impaired short-term memory and long-term memory. Aniracetam administration improved these behavioral deficits, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ADHD. The findings align with ADHD's pathophysiology, resembling the neurological impairments in TARP γ-8 KO mice. Aniracetam shows promise as a novel treatment for ADHD symptoms, highlighting its therapeutic value.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia in the world. It affects 6 million people in the United States and 50 million people worldwide. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques (Aβ), an increase in tau protein neurofibrillary tangles, and a loss of synapses. Since the 1990s, removing and reducing Aβ has been the focus of Alzheimer's treatment and prevention research. The accumulation of Aβ can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, neurotoxicity, and eventually apoptosis. These insults impair signaling systems in the brain, potentially leading to memory loss and cognitive decline. Aniracetam is a safe, effective, cognitive-enhancing drug that improves memory in both human and animal studies. Aniracetam may prevent the production and accumulation of Aβ by increasing α-secretase activity through two distinct pathways: 1) increasing brain derived neurotrophic factor expression and 2) positively modulating metabotropic glutamate receptors. This is the first paper to propose an evidence-based model for aniracetam reducing the accumulation and production of Aβ.",

After 90 min of MCAo, perampanel (an AMPAR antagonist, 1.5 mg/kg i.p) and aniracetam (an AMPA agonist, 50 mg/kg i.p.) were administered for different durations after MCAo. Later, after obtaining the best time point for the antagonist and the agonist treatment protocols, sequential treatment with perampanel and aniracetam were given, and the effect on neurological damage and post stroke recovery were assessed. Perampanel and aniracetam significantly protected MCAo-induced neurological damage and diminished the infarct percentage. Furthermore, treatment with these study drugs improved the motor coordination and grip strength. Sequential treatment with perampanel and aniracetam reduced the infarct percentage as assessed by MRI. Moreover, these compounds diminished the inflammation via reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) and increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) along with reductions in GFAP expression. Moreover, the neuroprotective markers (BDNF and TrkB) were found to be significantly increased. Levels of apoptotic markers (Bax, cleaved-caspase-3; Bcl2 and TUNEL positive cells) and neuronal damage (MAP-2) were normalized with the AMPA antagonist and agonist treatment. Expressions of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits of AMPAR were significantly enhanced with sequential treatment. The present study thus showed that modulation of AMPAR improves neurobehavioral deficits and reduces the infarct percentage through anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic effects.",

      "abstract": "Background: The piracetam analog, aniracetam, has recently received attention for its cognition enhancing potential, with minimal reported side effects.  Previous studies report the drug to be effective in both human and non-human models with pre-existing cognitive dysfunction, but few studies have evaluated its efficacy in healthy subjects. A previous study performed in our laboratory found no cognitive enhancing effects of oral aniracetam administration 1-hour prior to behavioral testing in naïve C57BL/6J mice. Methods: The current study aims to further evaluate this drug by administration of aniracetam 30 minutes prior to testing in order to optimize any cognitive enhancing effects. In this study, all naïve C57BL/6J mice were tested in tasks of delayed fear conditioning, novel object recognition, rotarod, open field, elevated plus maze, and marble burying. Results: Across all tasks, animals in the treatment group failed to show enhanced learning when compared to controls. Conclusions: These results provide further evidence suggesting that aniracetam conveys no therapeutic benefit to subjects without pre-existing cognitive dysfunction."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dementia constitutes an increasingly prevalent cognitive disorder with serious socioeconomic implications. AIMS: In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of aniracetam, either as monotherapy or combined with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), in terms of several neuropsychological parameters, in a considerable number of patients with dementia. RESULTS: In our prospective, open-label study, we enrolled a total of 276 patients (mean age 71 ± 8 years, 95 males) with cognitive disorders. Our study population comprised four groups: no treatment group (n = 75), aniracetam monotherapy group (n = 58), ChEIs monotherapy group (n = 68), and group of combined treatment (n = 68). Patients were examined with validated neuropsychological tests at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. In patients treated with aniracetam, all studied parameters were adequately maintained at 6 and 12 months, while emotional state was significantly improved at 3 months. In patients treated with ChEIs, we observed a significant cognitive deterioration at 12 months. The comparison between aniracetam and ChEIs in patients with relatively mild dementia (15 ≤ MMSE ≤ 25) revealed a significantly better cognitive performance with aniracetam at 6 months and improved functionality at 3 months. Comparing aniracetam monotherapy with combined treatment in the same population, aniracetam performed better in the cognitive scale at 6 months, and displayed a notable tendency for enhanced mood at 12 months and improved functionality at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that aniracetam (a nootropic compound with glutamatergic activity and neuroprotective potential) is a promising option for patients with cognitive deficit of mild severity. It preserved all neuropsychological parameters for at least 12 months, and seemed to exert a favorable effect on emotional stability of demented patients.",

      "abstract": "Several studies have emphasized the role of learning in the development of rapid tolerance and have shown that glutamate-mediated neurotransmission plays an important role in this phenomenon. Since the AMPA/kainate receptor system is directly involved in plasticity mechanisms, the influence of this receptor system on rapid tolerance induced by ethanol was studied using the rotarod. In the first experiment, mice were pretreated with aniracetam, an agonist of AMPA/kainate receptors, 30 min before ethanol (2.75 g/kg; IP) treatment, and tested on the rotarod. After 24 h, the groups were tested on the rotarod under ethanol treatment. Aniracetam facilitated the acquisition of rapid tolerance to ethanol. In the second experiment, mice received DNQX, a competitive antagonist of the AMPA receptor, 30 min before ethanol treatment (3 g/kg) and submitted to the rotarod. This dose of ethanol produced tolerance per se. Groups were tested under ethanol treatment (1.75 g/kg) after 24 h. DNQX blocked rapid tolerance to ethanol. Using a similar protocol, the third experiment showed that DNQX blocked the aniracetam-induced facilitation of rapid tolerance to ethanol. Our results show that aniracetam facilitates whereas DNQX blocks ethanol tolerance, suggesting that the non-NMDA receptors are involved in this phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Ethanol-induced damage in the developing hippocampus may result in cognitive deficits such as those observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Cognitive deficits in FASD are partially mediated by alterations in glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Recently, we reported that synaptic transmission mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) is impaired following fetal ethanol exposure. This finding led us to develop a rational approach for the treatment of alcohol-related cognitive deficits using aniracetam, an allosteric AMPAR modulator. In the present study, 28 to 34-day-old rats exposed to ethanol in utero were treated with aniracetam, and subsequently exhibited persistent improvement in mEPSC amplitude, frequency, and decay time. Furthermore, these animals expressed positive changes in synaptic single channel properties, suggesting that aniracetam ameliorates prenatal ethanol-induced deficits through modifications at the single channel level. Specifically, single channel open probability, conductance, mean open and closed times, and the number and burst duration were positively affected. Our findings emphasize the utility of compounds which slow the rate of deactivation and desensitization of AMPARs such as aniracetam.",

The present study examines the protective effects of aniracetam against H2O2-induced toxicity to neuron viability, mitochondria potential and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Methods Tetrazolium salt 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was used to detect neuronal viability. MitoTracker Red (CMX Ros), a fluorescent stain for mitochondria, was used to measure mitochondria potential. Electrophysiological technique was carried out to record hippocampal LTP. Results H2O2 exposure impaired the viability of neurons, reduced mitochondria potential, and decreased LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampus. These deficient effects were significantly rescued by pre-treatment with aniracetam (10-100 mu mol/L). Conclusion These results indicate that aniracetam has a strong neuroprotective effect against H2O2-induced toxicity, which could partly explain the mechanism of its clinical application in neurodegenerative diseases."

The present study evaluated the therapeutic effects of aniracetam against cognitive deficits in a well-characterized and sensitive FASD Sprague-Dawley rat model. Ethanol, administered orally at a moderate dose (4 g/kg/24 h; 38% v/v) during the entire course of pregnancy, caused severe cognitive deficits in offspring. Furthermore, both progeny genders were affected by a spectrum of behavioral abnormalities, such as a delay in the development of the righting reflex, poor novelty seeking behavior, and high anxiety levels in female rats. Cognitive disabilities, monitored in adult rats by a two-way active avoidance task, correlated well with a significant reduction of AMPA (alpha-amino-3 hydro-5 methyl-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic responses (mEPSCs) in the hippocampus. Administration of aniracetam for 10 days (post-natal days (PND) 18-27), at a dose of 50 mg/kg reversed cognitive deficits in both rat genders, indicated by a significant increase in the number of avoidances and the number of 'good learners'. After the termination of the nootropic treatment, a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs in hippocampal CA-1 pyramidal cells was observed. Significant anxiolytic effects on PND 40 also preceded acquisition improvements in the avoidance task. This study provides evidence for the therapeutic potential of aniracetam in reversing cognitive deficits associated with FASD through positive post-natal modulation of AMPA receptors.",

[Ca(2+)]i was measured by using Fura 2-AM fluorescent spectrophotometry. We found that membrane fluidity of the FC and HP synaptosomes was decreased in 14 months old mice compared with that in 3 months old mice. Similarly, Abeta25-35 (1 microM) decreased the membrane fluidity in 3 months old mice. These effects of ageing and Abeta25-35 on membrane fluidity were restored by aniracetam in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, Abeta25-35 (1 microM) largely increased [Ca(2+)]i in FC and HP synaptosomes in 3 months old mice, but this effect on HP synaptosomes was effectively reversed by aniracetam (1-4 mM).

Our results indicate that moderate ethanol exposure during pregnancy results in impaired hippocampal AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission, and critically timed aniracetam treatment can abrogate this deficiency. These results highlight the possibility that aniracetam treatment can restore synaptic transmission and ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Chronic cognitive impairment is an enduring aspect of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both humans and animals. Treating cognitive impairment in the post-traumatic stages of injury often involves the delivery of pharmacologic agents aimed at specific neurotransmitter systems. The current investigation examined the effects of the nootropoic drug aniracetam on cognitive recovery following TBI in rats. Three experiments were performed to determine (1) the optimal dose of aniracetam for treating cognitive impairment, (2) the effect of delaying drug treatment for a period of days following TBI, and (3) the effect of terminating drug treatment before cognitive assessment. In experiment 1, rats were administered moderate fluid percussion injury and treated with vehicle, 25, or 50 mg/kg aniracetam for 15 days. Both doses of aniracetam effectively reduced injury-induced deficits in the Morris water maze (MWM) as measured on postinjury days 11-15. In experiment 2, injured rats were treated with 50 mg/kg aniracetam or vehicle beginning on day 11 postinjury and continuing for 15 days. MWM performance, assessed on days 26-30, indicates that aniracetam-treated animals performed as well as sham-injured controls. In experiment 3, animals were injured and treated with aniracetam for 15 days. Drug treatment was terminated during MWM testing on postinjury days 16-20. In this experiment, aniracetam-treated rats did not perform better than vehicle-treated rats. The results of these experiments indicate that aniracetam is an effective treatment for cognitive impairment induced by TBI, even when treatment is delayed for a period of days following injury.",

Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PI-PTs) are responsible for the transport of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and other phospholipids through membranes. Isoform of PI-TPs (PI-TPalpha) is an essential component in ensuring substrate supply for phospholipase C (PLC). The current study was conducted to examine potential effect of aniracetam on PI-TPalpha expression and to characterize the PI-TPalpha isoform distribution between membrane and cytosol fractions of astrocytes exposed to simulated ischemia in vitro. After 8 h period of ischemia, the level of PI-TPalpha was significantly higher in cytosol (by about 28%) as well as in membrane fraction (by about 80%) in comparison with control. We have found that aniracetam treatment of astrocytes in normoxia significantly increased the level of PI-TPalpha in membrane fraction with a maximal effect at 0.1 microM concentration of aniracetam (by about 195% of control). In membrane fractions of ischemic cells, aniracetam increased PI-TPalpha expression in a concentration-dependent manner. In ischemic cells, aniracetam (10 microM) has elevated PI-TPalpha expression up to 155% and 428% in cytosolic and membrane fractions in comparison with ischemic untreated cells, respectively. The study has shown that aniracetam significantly activates PI-TPalpha in cell membrane fraction and this effect might be connected with previously described activation of MAP kinase cascade.",

      "abstract": "The present study focused on the mechanism of cytoprotective effect of aniracetam on the primary rat astrocyte cultures exposed to simulated ischemia conditions in vitro. To study these mechanisms, the aniracetam-mediated modulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt kinase pathways was determined. Simulated in vitro ischemia caused death of approximately 35% of astrocytes via apoptosis and decreased cell viability about 50% at 8 h. Exposure to aniracetam at concentrations of 0.1-10 microM in these conditions significantly decreased the number of apoptotic cells. Moreover, the intensification of 3-(4,5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolinum bromide (MTT) conversion and the decrease of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after 1 and 10 microM aniracetam treatment were observed indicating a significant increase in cell viability. When cultured astrocytes were incubated during 8 h simulated ischemia with [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene] (U0126), an extracellular regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) inhibitor or wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase)/Akt inhibitor, the cell apoptosis was accelerated. These effects of used kinase inhibitors (both U0126 and wortmannin) were antagonized by adding 1 and 10 microM aniracetam to the culture medium. In addition, aniracetam significantly stimulated of phospho-Erk1/2 kinase and phospho-Akt expression. Maximum levels of Erk1/2 and Akt activation were observed as a result of treatment with 10 microM aniracetam. U0126 and wortmannin markedly attenuated the effects of aniracetam on expression of activated kinases. Results of the present study indicate that both Erk1/2 and PI 3-K/Akt kinase pathways are vital for cytoprotective effect of aniracetam.",

Using the whole-cell patch technique, we first demonstrated that AMPA currents elicited by either local AMPA application or optic chiasm stimulation were augmented by aniracetam in the neurons of the SCN. The AMPA application-elicited increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in SCN slices was also enhanced by aniracetam treatment. The systemic injection of aniracetam dose-dependently (10-100 mg/kg) potentiated the phase delay in behavioral rhythm induced by brief light exposure of low intensity (3 lux) but not high intensity (10 or 60 lux) during early subjective night. Under the blockade of NMDA receptors by (+) MK801, aniracetam failed to potentiate a light (3 lux)-induced phase delay in behavioral rhythm. Aniracetam increased the photic induction of c-Fos protein in the SCN that was elicited by low intensity light exposure (3 lux). These results suggest that AMPA receptor-mediated responses facilitated by aniracetam can explain enhanced photic responses of the biological clock in the SCN of rodents.",

Treatment of the cultures with aniracetam (1, 10 and 100 mM) during 24 h ischemia simulated in vitro significantly decreased the number of apoptotic cells. The antiapoptotic effects of the drug were confirmed by the increase of intracellular ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) levels and the inhibition of the caspase-3 activity. Aniracetam also attenuated cellular oxidative stress by decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These effects were associated with the decrease in levels of c-fos and c-jun mRNA in primary astrocyte cultures exposed to 24 h ischemia. When cultured astrocytes were incubated during 24 h simulated ischemia with wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor or PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) (MEK) inhibitor the cell apoptosis was accelerated. This effect was antagonized by adding 100 mM aniracetam to the culture medium. These findings suggest that the protective effect of aniracetam is mediated by PI 3-kinase and MEK pathways in the downstream mechanisms.",

New discoveries in the behavioral pharmacology, biochemistry and pharmacokinetics of aniracetam provided new indications for this drug in the treatment of various CNS disorders or disease states. This article reviews these new findings and describes the effects of aniracetam in various rodent models of mental function impairment or cerebral dysfunction. Also, several metabolites of aniracetam have been reported to affect learning and memory in animals. It is, therefore, conceivable that major metabolites of aniracetam contribute to its pharmacological effects. The animal models, used in pharmacological evaluation of aniracetam included models of hypoattention, hypovigilance-arousal, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, fear and anxiety, depression, impaired rapid-eye movement sleep, disturbed temporal regulation, behavioral performance, and bladder hyperactivity. These are models of clinical disorders or symptoms that may include personality disorders, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and sleep disorders. At present, there is no convincing evidence that promising effects of aniracetam in the animal models will guarantee its clinical efficacy. It is conceivable, however, that clinical trials will demonstrate beneficial effects of aniracetam in the above listed disease states. New findings regarding the mechanism of action of aniracetam, its central target sites, and its effects on signal transduction are also discussed in this review article.",

This study investigated a possible mechanism for learning enhancement by examining the effects of aniracetam on contextual fear conditioning and activation of the y isoform of PKC (gamma-PKC) in male D2 mice. In comparison to animals treated with vehicle only (10% 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin), mice treated with aniracetam (100 mg/kg) 30 min prior to fear conditioning training demonstrated significantly improved contextual learning when tested 30 min and 24 h after training. This corresponded with a significant increase in activated, membrane-bound hippocampal gamma-PKC 30 min after training. No increase in learning or gamma-PKC was found 5 min after training. These results suggest an altered time course of activation of gamma-PKC in response to treatment with aniracetam, which improves learning in D2 mice.",

The potentiation was long-lasting, reaching approximately 180% of basal levels 60 min after 5-min treatment with 2-pyrrolidinone at 100 microM. 2-Pyrrolidinone (100 microM) potentiated GluR1,3 channel currents as observed in GluR1,2,3, but instead it depressed GluR1,2 currents. Aniracetam and p-anisic acid potentiated GluR1,2,3 channel currents, but to a lesser extent, each about 130 and 103% of basal levels 60 min after treatment at 100 microM. In contrast, anisamide butyrate had no potentiating effect on the currents. Potentiation of GluR1,2,3 channel currents obtained with 2-pyrrolidinone was inhibited by KN-93, a selective inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), while it was not affected by GF109203X, a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C or H-89, a selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The results of the present study suggest that 2-pyrrolidinone persistently enhances activity of the Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors, GluR1,3 and GluR1,2,3, by interacting with CaMKII.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the antidepressant-like property of aniracetam in rats and to clarify the mechanisms of action through the interaction studies with some receptor antagonists. METHODS: Antidepressant-like effects of aniracetam and various classes of compounds including different antidepressants were examined in a forced swim test with young (9 weeks old) and aged (25-30 months old) rats. Rats were exposed to a 5-min swim in a test session on day 2 following a 15-min swim in a training session on day 1, and immobility time during the period on day 2 was measured. The test compounds were administered subacutely (three doses over 2 days) or acutely (0.5 h before the testing). RESULTS: Standard antidepressants except for tandospirone significantly reduced immobility time in both young and aged rats. Aniracetam (10-100 mg/kg PO) failed to decrease immobility time in young rats, but it (100 mg/kg PO) significantly shortened immobility in aged rats, the effects of which were mainly mimicked by combined treatment of the metabolites, 2-pyrrolidinone and N-anisoyl-GABA. The effects of aniracetam was reversed completely by mecamylamine (10 mg/kg IP) or haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg IP) and slightly by ketanserin (1 m/kg IP) but was potentiated by scopolamine (0.03 mg/kg IP). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that aniracetam acts more effective when the forced swim stress-induced immobility is accompanied with brain dysfunction that occurs with aging. The antidepressant-like activity of aniracetam, which is probably due to the combined effects of 2-pyrrolidinone and N-anisoyl-GABA, may be mediated by mainly facilitating dopaminergic transmission (dopamine release and dopamine D2 receptor activation) through nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation.",

At a dose of 30 mg/kg per day p.o., aniracetam increased REM sleep in the light period after administration for 5 consecutive days. Consequently, suppressed REM sleep in SHRSP was restored by repeated treatment with aniracetam. Aniracetam could be useful in improving REM sleep impairment associated with vascular dementia.",

We measured choline acetyltransferase activity and acetylcholine release using in vivo brain microdialysis in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The enzyme activity in the pons-midbrain and hippocampus, and basal acetylcholine release in the nucleus reticularis thalami were lower in SHRSP than in age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats, indicating central cholinergic deficits in SHRSP. Repeated treatment of aniracetam (50 mg/kg p.o. x 11 for 6 days) preferentially increased the enzyme activity in the thalamus, whereas decreased it in the striatum. Among the metabolites of aniracetam, local perfusion of N-anisoyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 0.1 and/or 1 microM) and p-anisic acid (1 microM) into the nucleus reticularis thalami, dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of SHRSP produced a significant but delayed increase of acetylcholine release. We failed, however, to find any effect of aniracetam itself. A direct injection of N-anisoyl-GABA (1 nmol) into the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus of SHRSP enhanced the release in the nucleus reticularis thalami. Thus, these data prove that aniracetam can facilitate central cholinergic neurotransmission via both metabolites. Based on its pharmacokinetic profile, N-anisoyl-GABA may contribute to the clinical effects of aniracetam, mainly by acting on the reticulothalamic cholinergic pathway.",

Continuous administration of aniracetam for 7 days after the surgery prevented CMRGlc reduction in the frontal cortex ipsilateral to the lesion while the lesioned rats without aniracetam showed significant CMRGlc reduction in the frontal cortex. The level of CMRGlc in the lesion-side basal forebrain was lower in all rats regardless of the aniracetam treatment. Biochemical studies showed that aniracetam did not alter the reduction in the frontal ChAT activity. These results showed that aniracetam prevents glucose metabolic reduction in the cholinergically denervated frontal cortex with little effect on the cortical cholinergic system. The present study suggested that a neurotransmitter system other than the cholinergic system, e.g. the glutamatergic system, plays a central role in the cortical metabolic recovery after lesioning of the basal forebrain.",

      "abstract": "A great body of behavioural and neurophysiological evidence suggests that excitatory amino acids are involved in mechanisms of learning and memory. Moreover, degeneration of glutamatergic pathways may underlie the cognitive deficits seen in various disorders such as Alzheimer's dementia. As direct stimulation of glutamatergic receptors with agonists may increase the risk of toxicity and accelerate neuropathological changes, a more valid approach seems to be positive modulation of glutamatergic receptors that may reverse the symptoms with a lower risk of excitotoxic effects. Such a possibility offered by partial agonists of the strychnine-insensitive glycine site of the NMDA receptor (Gly-B site) or positive modulators of AMPA receptors, such as aniracetam. In the present study, the effects of d-cycloserine and aniracetam were tested in two animal models of cognitive deficits (entorhinal cortex lesion-induced deficits evaluated in the radial maze and scopolamine-induced amnesia evaluated in passive avoidance test). D-cycloserine (6 mg/kg, for 10 days) had no effect on spatial working memory deficit induced by entorhinal cortex lesions. It did, however, reverse scopolamine-induced deficits in the passive avoidance test when given acutely at the same dose. In contrast, aniracetam (50 mg/kg, for 10 days) produced beneficial effects in the radial maze test in rats with entorhinal cortex lesions, but given at the same dose acutely did not influence scopolamine-induced amnesia. The positive effect of d-cycloserine against scopolamine-induced amnesia may be probably related to the cholinergic-glutamatergic interaction in the hippocampus. The negative data obtained with d-cycloserine in the model of entorhinal cortex lesions-induced cognitive deficits could be taken as a hint that it is probably not suitable for the symptomatological therapy of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism of positive action of aniracetam cannot be explained on the basis of AMPA receptor modulation, as the dose used (50 mg/kg) is well below that required for the effect at AMPA receptors. Other actions such as peripheral effects or modulation of metabotropic receptors seem more likely.",

The fact that brain ischeamia for 40 min followed by reperfusion increased .OH was evidenced by detection of a peaked increase at 20 min after an ischaemic insult in the formation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHBA) from salicylate in cerebroventricular perfusate, a means of monitoring .OH formation. A clearcut increase in dopamine was also observed during and after brain ischaemia. The ischaemia-reperfusion mice given aniracetam at an intraperitoneal dose of 30 or 100 mg kg-1 showed a smaller increase in the formation of DHBA than those given the vehicle only. Aniracetam at 100 mg kg-1 significantly suppressed the formation of DHBA by approximately 80%, becoming evident at 20 min after reperfusion and thereafter. Protection against death in mice insulted with a 40-min brain ischaemia (3/13 vs 13/25) was observed following 100 mg kg-1 aniracetam. The increase in the dopamine levels was substantially reduced following aniracetam treatment and the reduction became significant at 20 min after reperfusion and thereafter in parallel with attenuation by aniracetam of DHBA formation. This finding suggests that the inhibitory activity of aniracetam in attenuating the hydroxyl free-radical formation in ischaemic mice is probably due, at least in part, to its palliative action on the dopaminergic neurons.",

It appears to positively modulate metabotropic glutamate receptors and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive glutamate receptors, and may facilitate cholinergic transmission, effects which are possibly related to its mechanism of action. Results from trials in elderly patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment due to senile dementia of the Alzheimer type suggest that aniracetam may be of benefit, with further trials required to confirm its efficacy profile and to define more precisely those patients most likely to respond to treatment. Aniracetam 1500 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in all tests at 4 and 6 months, and in a further 6-month trial was more effective than piracetam 2400 mg/day in 8 of 18 tests. Preliminary evidence in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment of cerebrovascular origin suggests aniracetam may also be of benefit in this condition. Whilst incidence rates of adverse effects are not yet available, data from trials suggest aniracetam is well tolerated. In particular, aniracetam does not appear to cause increases in liver enzyme levels. The evaluation of drugs for patients with senile cognitive disorders is a difficult area and therapeutic options are currently limited. Preliminary evidence of the potential benefits and good tolerability profile of aniracetam support continued evaluation of its use in patients with mild to moderate senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.",

The mGluR-evoked responses are potentiated by aniracetam, which per se also elicits neuroprotection. Aniracetam concentration-dependently counteracted glutamate-, kainate-, or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-induced cell death and greatly facilitated neuroprotective response achieved by different concentrations of both quisqualate and trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate.

Aniracetam had different effects on the waveform of synaptic potentials in hippocampus before and after induction of LTP: (1) the drug caused a slight reduction (or delay) of the initial segment of the response after LTP; and (2) the facilitatory effects of aniracetam occurred at a later time point in the response after LTP than before. The interactions between LTP and aniracetam were still present when synaptic responses were greatly reduced by partial blockade of postsynaptic receptors and were not reproduced by increasing release or the number of stimulated synapses. A mathematical treatment of synaptic currents produced the following results: (1) if aniracetam facilitates AMPA receptor currents simply by reducing desensitization, then its complex interaction with LTP emerges when potentiation changes the kinetic and conductance properties of receptor channels; (2) if aniracetam also significantly increases conductance, then the experimental data can be reproduced by modeling LTP as an increase in channel conductance alone.",

The two treatment groups were comparable at baseline for demographic and behaviourial parameters and symptomatology. Patients underwent clinical, behaviourial and psychometric evaluation every other month. The aniracetam group differed significantly from the placebo group by the end of the study and also showed a statistically significant improvement versus baseline in the psychobehavioural parameters, while in the placebo group a steady deterioration was observed. Tolerability to aniracetam was excellent.",

Drug efficiency evaluation was performed utilizing the following psychometric tests: Blessed Scale, figures repetition test, Benton test, Corsi test, Rey test, Pieron test, phrases construction test, verbal fluency test. They were carried out during basal visit after two and four month treatment. In Aniracetam treated group the score showed a significant improving during the first and second control. In placebo treated group no change statistically considerable happened in any test. Aniracetam has proved to be a useful drug in slight-moderate brain decay treatment of the elderly.",

The treatment periods were 3 months with aniracetam 1 g daily and 3 months with placebo. Neuropsychological tests as well as a physical and neurological examination were performed at entry into the study and after each treatment period, together with an evaluation of the subjects' overall condition. Neither the doctors' nor the subjects' own assessment of the overall condition indicated that the trial medication had had any effect. No significant changes in neuropsychological symptoms were observed. A statistically significant difference in favour of antiracetam was found in only 1 of the 19 neuropsychological test measures, namely a test for constructional ability. However, in another test on visuo-spatial function, a statistically significant result was found in favour of placebo. Thus, aniracetam was found to be ineffective in the treatment of subjects suffering from chronic psychosyndrome after long-term exposure to organic solvents.",

Neurological examinations were made before and after treatment and psychometric tests were performed before and after 1 month's and after 3 month's treatment. Treatment was interrupted due to occurrence of confusion in four cases in the aniracetam group and in one case in the placebo group. During treatment, an improvement was seen in several cognitive tests, especially those associated with memory, but this improvement occurred in the placebo as well as in the aniracetam-treated group. In clinical evaluation no difference was seen in efficacy between the two treatment groups.",
