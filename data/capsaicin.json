      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Capsaicin 8% patches are recommended for the treatment of localized neuropathic pain, which is a frequent reason for rheumatology consultations. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capsaicin 8% used in our Rheumatology Department. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective study. METHODS: Patients treated by capsaicin 8% between October 03, 2019 and December 31, 2023 were included. Their age, sex, pain duration, DN4 score, pain intensity, and the cause of the neuropathic pain were collected. Patch safety was assessed on the day of application and after 15 days. The patient was asked about improvement, pain intensity, and the occurrence of burning sensations. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients (mean age 62, 70% female) were included. The causes of neuropathic pain were especially scar (n = 31), digital osteoarthritis (n = 26), or radiculalgia (n = 22). Sixty patients reported improvement (54%) at day 15, with a mean percentage of improvement of 59%. Mean pain intensity decreased from 6.4 ± 1.9 to 4.5 ± 2.7 (p < 0.001). This improvement in pain was significant regardless of etiology. There was no difference in age, sex, and pain duration between improved and unimproved patients. Fifty-eight patients (58/106: 54.7%) experienced burning sensations after patching, mainly of moderate to high intensity (32/52: 61.5%), with an average duration of 2 days. Of the eight unimproved after the first patch, six reported a 50% improvement after the second patch. CONCLUSION: Capsaicin 8% appeared to be an effective treatment in localized neuropathic pain, whatever the cause. It seemed beneficial to repeat the application after the 1st one had failed. Burning sensations after placement were fairly frequent, usually moderate to high, but lasting only a short time."

      "abstract": "Background: A large number of patients suffer from neuropathic pain, and systemic therapy often remains ineffective while inducing severe side effects. Topical therapy with the TRPV1-agonist capsaicin is an established alternative, and the identification of co-therapeutics that modulate TRPV1 may be a promising approach to reduce the dose of capsaicin while maintaining efficacy. Here, we aimed to determine if the antidepressant amitriptyline displays properties rendering it a potential co-therapeutic agent. Methods: We performed patch clamp and calcium imaging experiments on HEK293T cells expressing human (h) TRPV1 as well as on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from adult mice. Results: Amitriptyline induced an increase in intracellular calcium in both HEK293T and mouse DRG neurons expressing TRPV1. Patch clamp experiments revealed a concentration-dependent activation of hTRPV1 by amitriptyline that was also evident in cell-free inside-out patches. When hTRPV1 was fully activated by capsaicin, amitriptyline induced concentration-dependent and partly reversible current inhibition. In contrast, amitriptyline potentiated small responses to capsaicin, heat and protons. We also found that amitriptyline desensitized hTRPV1 to capsaicin. This effect was reduced by the intracellular application of the strong calcium chelator BAPTA. Furthermore, the non-desensitizing mutant hTRPV1-Y672K displayed a reduced amitriptyline-induced desensitization. Conclusions: Our data showed that amitriptyline can activate, sensitize, desensitize and even inhibit TRPV1. Together with its property as a strong local anesthetic, our data suggest that amitriptyline may be a promising adjunct to topical capsaicin."

This pilot study aimed to evaluate changes in gustatory sensitivity and food preferences induced by capsaicin topical gel therapy in healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy female subjects applied capsaicin gel (0.025%) to the gingival mucosa twice daily for 14 days. Evaluations were conducted at baseline (T0), after 2 weeks (T1), after 4 weeks (T2), and after 4 weeks following discontinuation (T3). A matched control group underwent identical assessment without capsaicin application. Gustatory changes were measured using a modified taste strip method and a food preferences questionnaire. RESULTS: While subjective alterations in food perception, liking, and preferences were reported in the capsaicin group, no significant objective changes in gustatory perception (intensity and recognition of salty, sweet, sour, and bitter flavors) were observed. Subjective changes were reversible upon cessation of capsaicin use. CONCLUSIONS: Topical capsaicin gel influences subjective food perception and preferences without objectively altering gustatory function. These findings highlight the importance of considering such effects when prescribing capsaicin for oral somatosensory disorders, such as burning mouth syndrome or dysgeusia."

      "abstract": "Capsaicin (CAP), the principal bioactive component of chili peppers (Capsicum annuum L.), is widely recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties. However, its oral bioavailability is low, likely due to extensive sulfonation metabolism. Despite the well-known pharmacological benefits of CAP, the role of sulfotransferase (SULT)-mediated sulfonation in modulating its therapeutic effects remains poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the sulfonate metabolic profile of CAP, investigate the anti-inflammatory role of its sulfonate metabolite (CAP-S), and uncover the mechanisms underlying CAP-S's anti-inflammatory effects. In our study, the mono-sulfonate metabolite of CAP, designated as CAP-S ((E)-N-[(4-sulfo-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-8-methylnon-6-enamide), is identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). The metabolic profile of CAP was investigated in liver S9 fractions from human, rat, and mouse samples, with sulfonation of CAP examined using seven major recombinant SULT isoforms. The results demonstrate that CAP is primarily catalyzed by SULT1A subfamily and SULT1E1. The anti-inflammatory effects of CAP-S are evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and an acute liver injury (ALI) mouse model. CAP-S significantly reduces inflammatory mediators and nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. In vivo, CAP-S treatment alleviates hepatocyte necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduces aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and malondialdehyde levels, while enhancing superoxide dismutase activity and decreasing NO production. Additionally, CAP-S exerts comparable anti-inflammatory effects to CAP by suppressing NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, as evidenced by network pharmacology and western blot assays. These findings underscore the role of sulfonation in modulating CAP's therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Capsaicin (CAPS), a bioactive alkaloid derived from chili peppers, has garnered significant interest for its potential role as a combinatorial and chemosensitizing agent in cancer therapy. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that CAPS enhanced the efficacy of various anticancer agents by promoting apoptosis, modulating autophagy and inhibiting angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Additionally, CAPS modulated critical regulators of chemoresistance, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, thereby contributing to the reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR). Moreover, when administered in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, CAPS has been shown to improve treatment efficacy at lower drug concentrations. Given its multitargeted mechanism of action, CAPS represents a promising adjunct to conventional cancer therapies. However, due to its lipophilic nature, the development of optimized formulation strategies is essential to enhance its bioavailability and ensure consistent therapeutic outcomes. In conclusion, CAPS holds significant potential as a combinatorial and chemosensitizing agent, helping to overcome chemoresistance and enhance treatment outcomes across various malignancies. These promising findings warrant further preclinical and clinical investigations.",

      "abstract": "Capsaicin, the primary active ingredient and irritant in chili peppers, has been utilized across multiple fields as a food adductive or because of its potential anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and metabolic regulatory properties. Despite its diverse uses, the mechanism of action of capsaicin has not been fully revealed. Here, we investigated the changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome of A549 cells upon treatment with capsaicin for different durations and at different doses. Pressure cycling technology (PCT) was applied for rapid sample preparation and digestion, significantly improving the stability of phosphorylated proteins and allowing in-depth phosphoproteome analysis within 6 h with protein inputs of 100 μg. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic alterations can be used to accurately identify perturbations caused by various capsaicin doses and exposure durations. Proteomic analysis revealed that capsaicin administration affected the cell cycle and DNA damage pathways in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Compared with the proteomic changes, more sensitive and rapid alterations were observed in the phosphoproteome, a finding further supported by posttranslational modification (PTM) set enrichment analysis (PTM-SEA) of the phosphoproteomic data. The phosphorylation status of serine protein kinase, Aurora kinase A, and Aurora kinase B changed faster than their protein expression. Overall, the findings here identify the proteomic and phosphoproteomic alterations caused by capsaicin, providing new insights for multiomics analysis to elucidate chemical perturbations.",

Capsaicin (CAP) has been identified as a potential agent to counteract oxidative damage in the gastric mucosa; however, its precise mechanism remains unclear. This study demonstrates that CAP alleviates EtOH-induced gastric mucosal injuries through two primary pathways: by suppressing the chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4)/Src/p47phox axis, thereby reducing oxidative stress, and by inhibiting the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB) p65, resulting in diminished inflammatory responses.

In this work, phenol source capsaicin-mimicking N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzyl) acrylamide, two amine sources, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and furfurylamine (FFA), together with paraformaldehyde were used to prepare two benzoxazine coatings, P(HA) and P(HF). By reaction with iodomethane, the quaternary ammonium group was introduced into the N position of the oxazine ring. Quaternarily ammonified benzoxazine coatings P(HAI) and P(HFI) show exciting antibacterial performance compared to that of the untreated benzoxazine coating. The P(HFI) coating exhibited 93.8%, 96.4%, 99.9%, and 99.9% killing rates for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. The quaternary ammonization treatment also precipitated further enhanced anti-alga activity and excellent real-sea antifouling performances. However, the introduction of the ionic groups hindered the thermal polymerization of benzoxazine, leading to more defects on the coating surface, resulting in corrosion resistance that was poorer than that of HA and HF as detected from electrochemical corrosion and neutral salt spray experiments. The corrosion current density of the P(HA) and P(HF) coatings is 2 orders greater than that of the P(HAI) and P(HFI) coatings. Our results shed light on developing new quaternary ammonization treatment routes for polymeric coatings for the desired functions."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Diabetes mellitus is often accompanied by mental health complications, including anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. Recent research suggested that capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, may influence mental health. This study aimed to determine the effect of dietary capsaicin on mental disorders in a type 1 diabetes (T1D) mouse model, while also exploring the potential involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Methods: We induced T1D in mice using streptozotocin (STZ) and administered a diet supplemented with 0.005% capsaicin for five weeks. Behavioral assessments, including the open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and Morris water maze (MWM) test, were conducted to evaluate depressive and anxiety-like behaviors as well as cognitive function. Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed to assess neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus and serum metabolites, while 16S rRNA sequencing was utilized to analyze gut microbiota composition. Intestinal barriers were determined using western blot detection of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin. Results: Dietary capsaicin exacerbated anxiety and depressive-like behaviors along with cognitive declines in T1D mice. Capsaicin reduced gut microbiota diversity and levels of beneficial bacteria, while broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment further intensified anxiety and depression behaviors. Metabolomic analysis indicated that capsaicin disrupted metabolic pathways related to tryptophan and phenylalanine, leading to decreased neuroprotective metabolites, such as kynurenic acid, hippurate, and butyric acid. Additionally, capsaicin diminished the expression of ZO-1 and occludin, indicating increased intestinal permeability. Conclusions: Dietary capsaicin aggravates gut microbiota and metabolic disturbances in diabetic mice, thereby worsening anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline.",

Numerous clinical trials, post hoc analyses, and meta-analyses have investigated the efficacy and tolerability of the HC capsaicin patch. Despite this extensive body of research, a comprehensive narrative review covering publications on different pNeP conditions is lacking. This narrative review aims to fill the gap by analyzing 52 studies, including randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence. The results show that the HC capsaicin patch consistently provides pain relief and improves quality of life for several pNeP conditions, with increasing benefits seen with repeated treatments. It was found to be superior to placebo and comparable to standard care, regardless of the origin of the pain. Early initiation of therapy appears to improve efficacy, although patients with more prolonged pain also benefit. While the exact mechanisms of action are still unclear, there is evidence to suggest a potential benefit from nerve regeneration in some conditions. However, limited information exists regarding the alteration of treatment intervals and the variation in the size of the painful area upon re-treatment. The review also identifies variability in response rates for different types of pNeP and a lack of reliable predictors of treatment success, indicating a need for further research. In conclusion, the HC capsaicin patch is effective and well tolerated across a range of pNeP conditions, with increasing efficacy upon retreatment. It is a valuable treatment option, although more research is needed to refine its clinical use and explore its full therapeutic potential."

Unfortunately, new variants emerge of these viruses will make it difficult for pigs vaccinated with the appropriate vaccine to develop protective immunity. Hence, it is urgent to explore effective therapeutic agents and targets against these viruses. Capsaicin is an active compound found in plants of the Capsicum genus (prevention and/or treatment of pain, hypertension and inflammation), but little is known about its effects on enterovirus infections. Herein, we used porcine enteric coronavirus TGEV as a model to evaluate the antiviral activity of capsaicin and discovered that capsaicin inhibited the replication phase of TGEV. Mechanistically, calcium signaling pathway participates in the capsaicin-mediated antiviral function. Importantly, capsaicin treatment impaired the viral replication by attenuating cytosolic calcium, and supplementation with CaCl2 reduced the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on TGEV infection. Finally, we revealed that TRPV4 plays an essential role in modulating calcium ion influx in IPEC-J2 cells, and capsaicin inhibits TGEV replication by decreasing calcium ion influx through inhibition of TRPV4. Overall, our data suggest that capsaicin is a promising small molecular drug candidate for strengthening host resistance to porcine enteric coronavirus infection.",

      "abstract": "This study was developed with the goal of exploring the impact of capsaicin on ruminal fermentation and ruminal bacteria in beef cattle affected by high-grain diet-induced subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). In total, 18 healthy Simmental crossbred cattle were randomized into three separate groups (n = 6/group): (1) control diet (CON; forage-to-concentrate ratio = 80:20); (2) high-grain diet (SARA; forage-to-concentrate ratio = 20:80); and (3) high-grain diet supplemented with capsaicin (CAP; 250 mg/cattle/day). The study was conducted over a 60-day period. The results showed that the SARA model was successfully induced in the SARA group with a high-grain diet. Relative to the SARA group, the addition of capsaicin elevated the ruminal pH from 5.40 to 6.36 (p < 0.01), and decreased the total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from 133.95 to 82.86 mmol/L (p < 0.01), aligning closely with the levels observed in the CON group. The addition of capsaicin increased the alpha diversity of ruminal bacteria relative to the SARA group, as evidenced by a lower Simpson index (p < 0.05), together with increases in the Ace, Chao, and Shannon indices (p < 0.05). Bacteroidota and Firmicutes were the most common phyla across all treatment groups, while Prevotella was the predominant genera. The unique bacterial genera (LDA scores > 4) identified within the SARA group comprised Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-001, Succinivibrio, NK4A214_group, Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, and Ruminococcus, which may serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of SARA. The unique genera associated with the CON group included Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG-003, and U29-B03, while those for the CAP group included Succiniclasticum and Prevotellaceae_UCG-004. In summary, these results suggest that dietary capsaicin supplementation can limit the adverse effects of SARA through the modulation of bacterial communities within the rumen, thus altering ruminal fermentation in beef cattle."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: CAPTRANE evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of high-concentration capsaicin patch (HCCP) vs. oral pregabalin for the treatment of postsurgical neuropathic pain (PSNP) following breast cancer surgery. The study was designed with the aim of demonstrating noninferiority of one HCCP against daily pregabalin. Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, open-label study conducted across nine centers in France. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score after 2 months. Results: Recruitment challenges resulted in the randomization of 140 patients (versus 644 planned); the per-protocol population comprised 107 patients (HCCP: n = 65; pregabalin: n = 42). Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. In the per-protocol analysis, the mean (standard deviation) change versus baseline in NPRS score was -1.926 (2.554) with HCCP and -1.634 (2.498) with pregabalin. The prespecified analysis showed that HCCP was not inferior to pregabalin: the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval for the between-arm difference was -0.889 and the upper bound was +0.260 (i.e., below the predefined clinical threshold of +0.4). Patient-reported outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between treatments. The painful area size decreased significantly more with HCCP. Tolerability profiles differed, with HCCP mostly causing application-site reactions. While >50% of patients switched from pregabalin to HCCP, none switched from HCCP to pregabalin. Conclusions: This comparative study in PSNP post breast cancer surgery, evaluating a single treatment of HCCP, shows a noninferior reduction in pain intensity, a superior reduction in painful area size, and a patient preference for HCCP compared with pregabalin. Despite limitations, it contributes valuable initial data for PSNP management in breast cancer care."

Twenty Holstein cows with an average parity of 2.5 ± 0.76, milk production of 31.30 ± 2.39 kg, and 36.10 ± 2.38 days to calving were randomly assigned to either a control group fed a basal diet or a treatment group supplemented with 1.2 g/head/day of capsaicin. The supplementation was administered during an evaluation period spanning from 28 days before delivery to 21 days after delivery using a randomized block experimental design. Results showed that capsaicin significantly reduced milk somatic cell count and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) while enhancing serum antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT) and immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM). Moreover, capsaicin altered gut microbiota composition, increasing the relative abundance of beneficial genera. These findings suggest that dietary capsaicin supplementation during the transition period improves lactation performance and supports immune function, as well as alleviates oxidative stress. This study highlights the potential of capsaicin as a practical dietary strategy for enhancing productivity in dairy farming."

Furthermore, compound 14 (IC50 = 0.51 ± 0.06 μM) showed over 100-fold increasing antifibrotic activity compared to capsaicin (IC50 = 53.71 ± 4.78 μM). Notably, compound 14 could target TRPV1, thereby affecting the expression of the fibrosis markers Collagen Ⅰ and α-SMA by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smads and MAPK pathways to exert antifibrotic activity in vitro. Compound 14 significantly inhibited collagen deposition in lung tissues, ameliorated alveolar structures, and increased survival rates in mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, compound 14 possessed lower cytotoxicity (compared to nitedanib) and no toxicity in mice. Overall, compound 14 promise as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of IPF.",

      "abstract": "Capsaicin, a polyphenol, is known to regulate energy expenditure and thermogenesis in adipocytes and muscles. However, its role in modulating uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent thermogenesis in muscles remains unclear. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying the role of capsaicin in modulating the UCP- and ATP-dependent thermogenesis in C2C12 myoblasts, as well as the gastrocnemius (GM) and soleus muscles (SM) of mice. We employed molecular dynamics (MD), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR), immunoblots, staining methods, and assay kits to investigate the role of capsaicin on thermogenesis and its modulatory roles on the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and α-/β-adrenergic receptors (ARs) using in vitro and in vivo models. Our findings demonstrate that capsaicin treatment in high-fat diet-induced obese mice reduces weight gain and elevates the expression of UCP- and ATP-dependent thermogenic effectors through ATP-consuming calcium and creatine futile cycles. In vitro and in vivo models capsaicin treatment elevated the expression of sarcoendoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA-1 and -2), ryanodine receptors (RYR-1 and -2), uncoupling proteins (UCP-2 and -3), creatine kinase B (CKB), and creatine kinase mitochondrial 2 (CKMT2), through activation of TRPV1, α1-, β2-, and β3-AR as well as the suppressed expression of α2-AR. Furthermore, our results also indicate that capsaicin promotes myotube development and enhances lipid metabolism in C2C12 cells. We found that capsaicin increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and the expression of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), suggesting that elevated mitochondrial Ca2+ levels boost the expression of oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes via the activation of the ATP-futile cycle. Mechanistic studies in C2C12 cells revealed that TRPV1 is likely dispensable for capsaicin-induced thermogenesis, and TRPV1 and α1-AR may synergistically induce thermogenesis. Collectively, our findings have uncovered a novel mechanism of UCP- and ATP-dependent thermogenesis and its associated pathways in both cellular and animal models which is crucial for designing therapeutic strategies to address obesity and associated metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Background: Capsaicin is commonly used as a flavoring and a riot control agent. However, long-term exposure or high doses can cause acute lung injury in military and police personnel. The mechanisms underlying capsaicin-induced pulmonary toxicity remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in capsaicin-induced acute lung injury using C57BL/6N mice. Methods: Through both transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of mouse lung tissue, we identified the involvement of the TNF signaling pathway in capsaicin-mediated acute lung injury. Next, we explored the role of TNF signaling in the progression of acute lung injury to identify potential therapeutic targets. In a capsaicin-induced acute lung injury mouse model and A549 cells, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the TNF-α antibody Nerelimomab. Compared with the control group, TNF-α up-regulation was observed, which correlated with increased pathological changes and elevated IL-6 (p < 0.01) and IL-18 (p < 0.01) levels, both in vivo and in vitro. Results: Flow cytometry revealed that compared to the capsaicin group, Nerelimomab treatment reduced the number of capsaicin-induced apoptotic cells (p < 0.001) and was associated with an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio (p < 0.01) and reduced cleaved caspase 3 expression (p < 0.001). Analysis of A549 cells treated with capsaicin and Nerelimomab corroborated these results. These findings confirm the involvement of the TNF signaling pathway in capsaicin-induced acute lung injury and the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells. Conclusions: In conclusion, capsaicin inhalation can cause acute lung injury, and targeting the TNF signaling pathway offers a promising therapeutic strategy. Nerelimomab demonstrates significant potential in alleviating acute lung injury by inhibiting inflammatory mediator release and diminishing apoptosis. Based on transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, this study highlights the crucial role of the TNF signaling pathway in capsaicin-induced acute lung injury and supports the therapeutic efficacy of Nerelimomab in reducing epithelial apoptosis."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are recently emerging as promising anticancer agents because of their high bioavailability, low toxicity and remarkable anticancer activities. However, the application of SeNPs in anticancer has been limited due to instability. Herein, Capsaicin (Cap), a natural active compound found in chili peppers with favorable anticancer activity, was modified with SeNPs to prepare Cap-decorated SeNPs (Cap@SeNPs), and the antiproliferative effect and mechanism of Cap@SeNPs in HepG2 were investigated. METHODS: Cap@SeNPs were prepared through a redox method and characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, the inhibitory rate of Cap@SeNPs on HepG2 cells was determined by the MTT assay. Finally, the antiproliferative mechanism of Cap@SeNPs was explored through analysis of cell cycle, cell viability, reactive oxygen species levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, nuclear morphology, and caspase activity. RESULTS: Our results revealed that stable and well-dispersed Cap@SeNPs were successfully fabricated, and the optimum mass ratio of sodium selenite to Cap was 1:2. In addition, Cap@SeNPs showed significant antiproliferative effects on HepG2 cells compared with naked SeNPs. Furthermore, Cap@SeNPs inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells by elevating total ROS levels, causing nuclear condensation, affecting mitochondrial membrane potential, which in turn influences caspase protease activity and induces apoptosis. CONCLUSION: This study developed an innovative approach to enhance the value of Cap, demonstrating that Cap@SeNPs hold promise as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Standard rectal cancer treatment includes neoadjuvant radiotherapy sensitized by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. However, 5-FU increased chemoradiotherapy response rate comes with significant toxicity, especially in older, frail patients. The development of alternatives to chemotherapy enabling radiosensitization with limited systemic toxicity is therefore needed to improve patient management. Bioactive food components (BFCs) can exhibit chemo or radio-sensitizing properties against cancer cells. Moreover, the cytotoxic action of BFCs may be tumor-specific, with reduced impact on healthy cells. We hypothesized that BFCs, in particular resveratrol and capsaicin, alone or in association, could lead to specific radio-sensitization of colorectal tumors while offering reduced toxicity compared to 5-FU. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Colorectal tumor and non-tumor cell lines were treated with resveratrol, capsaicin, or 5-FU, alone or in combination, then irradiated; survival, cell cycle, and apoptosis were analyzed. RAGγ2C-/- mice with xenografts received oral resveratrol, resveratrol + capsaicin, or 5-FU, followed by radiotherapy, with tumor growth and systemic toxicity evaluated. KEY RESULTS: Resveratrol alone or in association with capsaicin radio-potentiates colorectal tumor cells in vitro, impacting both cell cycle and apoptosis. In a preclinical mouse model, the oral administration of resveratrol and capsaicin, but not resveratrol alone, allowed the radio-sensitization of subcutaneous colorectal tumors with similar efficiency to 5-FU. Moreover, the global as well as the hematological toxicity of the BFC association was lower than those of 5-FU. CONCLUSION: This work establishes BFCs as effective enhancers of radiotherapy, offering a safer alternative to traditional radiosensitization with chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "As a common malignancy symptom, cancer pain significantly affects patients' quality of life. Approximately 60%-90% of patients with advanced cancer experience debilitating pain. Therefore, a comprehensive treatment system that combines cancer pain suppression and tumor treatment could provide significant benefits for these patients. Here, we designed a manganese oxide (MnO2)/Bovine serum albumin (BSA)/polydopamine (PDA) composite nanoplatform internally loaded with capsaicin for cancer pain suppression and immunotherapy. MBD&C nanoparticles (NPs) can ablate tumor-innervated sensory nerve fibers via Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels, thereby reducing the pain caused by various inflammatory mediators. The ablation of TRPV1+ nerve terminals can also decrease the secretion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) in sensory nerve fibers, thus reducing the tumor pain and inhibit tumor progression. MBD&C can promote calcium influx by activating overexpressed TRPV1 channels on the tumor membrane surface, thereby achieving cancer immunotherapy induced by endogenous Ca2+ overloading. In addition, MnO2 NPs can alleviate tumor hypoxia and mitigate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Ultimately, this treatment system with dual capabilities of inhibiting tumor growth and relieving cancer pain makes comfortable tumor therapy feasible and paves the way for the development of patient-centered approaches to cancer treatment in the future.",

      "abstract": "Capsaicin is a polyphenol with a well-known anti-obesity potential, which could activate brown adipose tissue and promote the browning of white adipose tissue. Indeed, conventional proteomics have been used to investigate the browning effects of capsaicin on adipose tissue. However, the existence of a layer of white adipose tissue above the interscapular brown adipose tissue poses a great challenge to obtain intact interscapular brown adipose tissue without including adjacent white adipose tissue. Therefore, the traditional method normally focuses on changes occurring in the bottom layer of interscapular brown adipose tissue. Spatial metabolomics is an omics method that enables the analysis of metabolite distributions in tissue sections. Therefore, in the current study, spatial metabolomics was utilized to investigate the effects of dietary capsaicin intervention on interscapular brown adipose tissue and adjacent white adipose tissue. The results indicated several noteworthy findings that capsaicin treatment may induce similar metabolite alterations across various regions of brown adipose tissue irrespective of their proximity to WAT, while it also markedly influences the metabolites in the adjacent white adipose tissue. A KEGG pathway analysis further revealed these changes were associated with key characteristics of beige energy metabolism pathways, such as thermogenesis, glycerol phospholipid metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway. Taken together, this study may supplement useful details to understand the mechanisms of capsaicin enhancing BAT activity and promoting WAT browning."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can cause chemotherapy dose reductions and impact patients' quality of life. Few proven treatments exist, with generally modest analgesic effects and possible side effects. Small studies show the beneficial effects of topical capsaicin 8% on pain. AIM: To investigate capsaicin's effects on pain, neurotoxicity, and mood in patients with CIPN. DESIGN: Prospective data collection in patients treated with capsaicin 8% for painful CIPN. METHODS: In 17 patients, data was collected before (t0) and directly (t1), 2 weeks (t2), and 8 weeks (t3) after capsaicin 8% treatment. Differences between t0-t2 and t0-3 were assessed for pain (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]; acceptability), neurotoxicity symptoms (20-item questionnaire [CIPN20]; mechanical detection [MDT] and pain [MPT] thresholds), and mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score [HADS]). RESULTS: For 9 patients (53%), pain became \"acceptable\" at t2 and t3, with a significant reduction (pain intensity difference [PID]t0-2: -1.72, PIDt0-3: -2.47, both p < .001), whereas average NRS did not change significantly for patients scoring \"unacceptable.\" HADS anxiety scores remained unchanged, whereas depression scores decreased from baseline (t0-2: -1.47, p = .014; t0-3: -1.36, p = .021). CIPN20 decreased from baseline (t0-2: -1.87, p = .004; t0-3: -3.32 p = .002). MPT was significantly lower post-treatment and MDT did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Capsaicin 8% can have a beneficial analgesic effect in patients with CIPN-related pain but with a marked \"on-off\" effect. Mood changes were marginal. Quantitative sensory testing findings do not support earlier findings on nerve degeneration after capsaicin treatment, although the study size was small for definitive conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Though Capsaicin from chili peppers was known to have antitumor effects in several cancers, the underlying antitumor pathogenesis of Capsaicin is not clear to date. Thus, the antitumor mechanism of Capsaicin was explored in Hep3B and Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in relation to c-Myc/monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) signaling. To elucidate the antitumor mechanism of capsaicin, cytotoxicity assay, cell cycle analysis, Western blotting, RT-qPCR, RNA interference, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, and mouse xenograft model were used in this work. Capsaicin increased the cytotoxicity, subG1 population, and the number of TUNEL-positive bodies in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Consistently, Capsaicin diminished the expression of pro-PARP, HK2, PKM2, LDHA, glucose transporter type 1 (Glut1), c-Myc, and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) in Huh7 and Hep3B cells, along with decreased production of glucose, lactate, and ATP. However, a glycolysis end product pyruvate treatment reversed the capacity of Capsaicin to attenuate the expression of pro-PARP, HK2, c-Myc, and MCT4 in Hep3B cells. Furthermore, Capsaicin reduced c-Myc stability in the presence of cycloheximide and induced c-Myc ubiquitination in Hep3B cells, while c-Myc directly binds to MCT4 as a lactate transporter and downstream of c-Myc in Hep3B cells by immunoprecipitation and correlation factor (Spearman efficient = 0.0027). Furthermore, a preliminary analysis of an animal study reveals that Capsaicin significantly suppressed the growth of Hep3B cells inoculated in BALB/c nude mice without hurting body weight, liver, and spleen. Our findings provide novel evidence that Capsaicin exerts apoptotic and anti-Warburg effect via c-Myc/MCT4 signaling axis as a potent anticancer candidate for liver cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Migraine is a disease that stands out for its high prevalence and socioeconomic costs. It involves the entire trigeminovascular system, the signaling substances, and their targets. However, the role of meningeal mast cells in migraine is still unclear. To better understand one of the components of neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine pathophysiology, we developed an in vivo rat model in which the dura mater was exposed bilaterally to investigate the influence of topiramate on capsaicin-induced mast cell degranulation and CGRP release from dura mater. METHODS: On the day of the experiment, rats were anesthetized, and a craniectomy was performed on each parietal bone. Test substances were applied in situ over the dura mater using the right and left sides of the dura mater for the test and control, respectively. After exposure, the dura mater was processed for mast cell staining and counting. Using this setup, the effect of capsaicin (10-3 M) was evaluated in rats of both sexes, and subsequently the effect of in situ (10-3 M, 20 µL) and (20 mg/kg/day for 10 days) topiramate treatment on mast cell degranulation and CGRP release were evaluated. RESULTS: In both female and male rats, there was a greater amount of degranulated mast cells in the side stimulated by capsaicin compared to the control side in both females (18 ± 3% vs. 74 ± 3%; p = 0.016) and males (28 ± 2% vs. 74 ± 3%, p = 0.016). In the group treated with topiramate for 10 days prior to the experiments, capsaicin did not induce mast cell degranulation (control 20 ± 1% vs. capsaicin 22 ± 1%, p = 0.375) in contrast to animals treated for 10 days with gavage control (control 25 ± 1% vs. capsaicin 76 ± 1%, p = 0.016). Topiramate applied in situ concomitant with capsaicin did not protect the mast cells from degranulation in response to capsaicin (38 ± 2% vs. 44 ± 1%, p = 0.016). There was a significant reduction in CGRP release from the dura mater in the group treated with topiramate for 10 days compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a novel experimental model wherein systemic administration of topiramate is observed to modulate the impact of capsaicin on meningeal mast cell degranulation."

METHODS: A systematic review with pooled analysis was conducted utilizing the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Five commonly used databases were employed utilizing a search string made from MeSH terms and boolean operators. Retrieved articles were then subjected to title and abstract appraisal, followed by full-text appraisal by two independent reviewers and an adjudicator to break ties. RESULTS: A total of 127 articles were retrieved from five commonly used databases. Of the 127 articles, 20 were subjected to full-text appraisal, with 12 remaining for inclusion. Due to a heterogeneity greater than the 50% threshold provided by Cochrane, a random-effects pooled-analysis was conducted in lieu of meta-analysis. The random-effects pooled-analysis denotes an overall Cohen's d of 1.09 (95% CI: 0.58-1.56; p < 0.001). All studies that investigated neuropathic pain area denote a decrease in pain size, with some denoting a continued reduction with subsequent application.

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common intestinal disease characterized by abdominal pain, abdominal distension and irregular defecation frequency, and it has had a high incidence and low cure rate in recent years. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) is one of the main physiological indicators of IBS, and TRPV1 and TRPM8 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and melastatin 8) play crucial roles in VH and are widely distributed in the intestine, significantly impacting abdominal pain in IBS patients. Under the guidance of PRISMA, four databases were systematically searched at the outset, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting specific abdominal pain scores (rather than the incidence rate) in IBS patients receiving capsaicin or menthol (agonist of TRPV1 and TRPM8) interventions were included. A meta-analysis was conducted on the retrieved studies, which consisted of three articles on capsaicin and five articles on menthol, to compare the efficacy of capsaicin and menthol in alleviating abdominal pain in IBS patients under conditions of low heterogeneity. The results demonstrated that menthol had a significant effect in relieving abdominal pain in IBS patients. Conversely, although the effect of capsaicin was not statistically significant, two studies involving long-term capsaicin intervention suggested its potential to reduce VH and subsequently relieve abdominal pain, which may be attributed to the up-regulation of the TRPV1 receptor in the gastrointestinal tract of individuals with IBS.",

The use of capsaicin in the treatment of neuropathic pain currently has a high level of evidence, and the use of casaicin 8% can be recommended as a second choice medication in the treatment of these pathologies. Capsaicin has actually a good level of evidence in knee osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of cryotherapy to reduce the burning pain induced by capsaicin (8%) patches (QUTENZA) in a neuropathic pain cohort. We also investigated subsequent neuropathic pain during an 8-week follow-up. DESIGN: The present work resulted from a prospective, randomized, two-center, open-label, interventional French trial. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the effects of cooling of the application area of QUTENZA patches. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were measured 30 and 60 minutes after patch application. Weekly neuropathic VAS scores were then collated for 2 months. Ninety-nine patients were included and randomized into a cryotherapy group (n = 50 [80% women], median age = 51 years old) and a no cryotherapy group (n = 49 [69% women], median age = 48 years old). RESULTS: Cooling at the application site of the patch resulted in a reduction by 3.20 in burning pain VAS score at 60 minutes, with no cooling VAS 6.99 (95% CI [6.2, 7.77]) versus 3.78 (95% CI [3, 4.56]) for cryotherapy. Neuropathic VAS pain scores over the follow-up period were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: Cryotherapy at the application site significantly reduced the burning pain induced by capsaicin patches but had no effect on neuropathic pain for the 8 weeks following application. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The use of cooling during capsaicin patch application, by ameliorating the therapeutic alliance, improves the clinical management of neuropathic pain. © 20XX by the American Society for Pain Management Nursing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options. Mesothelioma therapy often involves a multimodal approach including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the prognosis for patients remains poor. Difficult diagnosis, late symptoms when the tumor is in an advanced stage and the onset of chemotherapy resistance make mesothelioma difficult to treat. For this reason, it is essential to discover new pharmacological approaches. Capsaicin (CAPS) is the active compound of chili peppers. Based on CAPS's anticancer properties on various tumor lines and its chemo-sensitizing action on resistant cells, in this study, we evaluated the effects of CAPS on mesothelioma cells to assess its potential use in mesothelioma therapy. METHODS: To evaluate antiproliferative effects of CAPS, we performed MTS assays on various mesothelioma cells, representative of all major mesothelioma subtypes. Transwell migration and wound-healing assays were used to examine the effect of CAPS on mesothelioma cell migration. We also determined the effects of CAPS on oncogenic signaling pathways by assessing the levels of AKT and MAPK activation. RESULTS: In this study, we show that CAPS significantly reduces proliferation of both parental and cisplatin-resistant mesothelioma cells. CAPS promotes S-phase cell cycle arrest and inhibits lateral motility and migration of mesothelioma cells. Accordingly, CAPS suppresses AKT and ERK1/2 activation in MSTO-211H and NCI-H2052 cells. Our results support an antitumor effect of CAPS on cisplatin-resistant mesothelioma cells, suggesting that it may reduce resistance to cisplatin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results could pave the way for further studies to evaluate the use of CAPS for mesothelioma treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The resolution of the skin's inflammatory response is only possible if its barrier function is restored. TRPV1 channel activation plays an important role during inflammation but the effect of this activation on the skin barrier under inflammatory conditions has not been clarified. We hypothesize that it could potentially aid the keratinocyte barrier by reducing inflammatory cytokine release and promoting tight junction development. METHODS: To explore the role of TRPV1 activation in inflammation, we designed and optimized an in vitro model of keratinocytes with basal epidermal layer characteristics using HaCaT cells and TNFα to induce inflammation. RESULTS: TNFα increased the gene expression of tight junction protein claudin 1 (CLDN1) by at least 2.60 ± 0.16-fold, in a concentration-dependent manner, over a 48 h period. The administration of a capsaicin pre-treatment reduced the CLDN1 expression to 1.51 ± 0.16-fold during the first 6 h after TNFα induction, whereas IL-8 cytokine release was reduced 0.64 ± 0.17-fold. After 48 h, CLDN1 protein levels increased by a factor of 6.57 ± 1.39 compared to cells only treated with TNFα. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin can potentiate the increase in CLDN1 expression and CLDN1 protein synthesis induced by TNFα in cultured keratinocytes, while reducing the release of IL-8."

      "abstract": "Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a highly prevalent cancer worldwide. Microbial infections, poor oral hygiene, and chronic viral infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV) contribute to its incidence. Capsaicin, known for its presence in chili peppers, has demonstrated potential antiproliferative effects in cancer cells. It operates by inducing programmed cell death, regulating the expression of transcription factors, halting cell cycle progression, and influencing growth signal transduction pathways. These findings suggest capsaicin's promising role as a candidate for further exploration in combating oral cancer. Aim This study intends to identify and evaluate the anticancer properties of capsaicin on oral cancer cells through in vitro investigations. Methodology Using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) technique, the cell viability of oral cancer cells treated with capsaicin was evaluated. Capsaicin was applied to the KB1 cells in a range of concentrations (25-150 µg/mL) over 24 hours. The morphological alterations of the cells were assessed using a phase contrast microscope. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) were subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gene expression analysis. To investigate nuclear morphological changes, oral cancer cells were stained with acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr). The apoptotic nuclei were visualized using a fluorescent microscope. A scratch wound healing test was performed to check for capsaicin's anti-migratory potential. Result In our investigation of oral cancer cells treated with capsaicin, there was a significant drop in cell viability between the control and treatment groups (p < 0.05). The inhibitory concentration (IC50) was found to be 74.4 μM/mL in oral cancer cells. Following treatment, fewer cells were present, and those that were present shriveled and exhibited cytoplasmic membrane blebbing. Under AO/EtBr staining, treated cells exhibited chromatin condensation and nuclear disintegration. Furthermore, the migration of capsaicin-treated cells was significantly lower than that of control cells. The results of gene expression analysis demonstrated a considerable downregulation of TNFα and NFκB following capsaicin administration. Conclusion The study's findings suggest that capsaicin may have anti-tumor properties in oral cancer cells. More research is desperately needed to fully understand the mechanism underlying capsaicin's anticancer potential and therapeutic applicability."

      "abstract": "Non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) is a prevalent condition with limited effective treatments. Capsaicin, an agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1 (TRPV1) receptor, has emerged as a potential therapeutic option for NAR by targeting heightened nasal reactivity. This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO, evaluated the efficacy of capsaicin for NAR treatment. Nine studies with placebo-controlled group were included, with primary outcomes assessed as total nasal symptom scores (TNSS), visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and the proportion of therapeutic responders. Meta-analysis revealed significant improvements in TNSS and VAS scores, along with a higher proportion of therapeutic responders in patients receiving capsaicin treatment compared to placebo. While some studies demonstrated reductions in substance P levels and TRPV1 expression after capsaicin treatment, further investigation is warranted. This meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence suggesting that capsaicin treatment holds promise for alleviating symptoms in patients with NAR. However, the limited number of studies and methodological heterogeneity necessitate larger and more rigorously designed clinical trials with standardized methodologies and advanced diagnostic techniques to establish their definitive roles in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is a global health challenge with rising incidence and mortality rates, posing significant concerns. The World Health Organization reports cancer as a leading cause of death worldwide, contributing to nearly one in six deaths. Cancer pathogenesis involves disruptions in cellular signaling pathways, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. Among emerging players in cancer biology, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, notably TRPV1, have garnered attention due to their altered expression in cancer cells and roles in tumorigenesis and progression. TRPV1, also known as the capsaicin receptor, is pivotal in cancer cell death and pain mediation, offering promise as a therapeutic target. Activation of TRPV1 triggers calcium influx and affects cell signaling linked to growth and death. Additionally, TRPV1 is implicated in cancer-induced pain and chemo-sensitivity, with upregulation observed in sensory neurons innervating oral cancers. Also, when capsaicin, a compound from chili peppers, interacts with TRPV1, it elicits a \"hot\" sensation and influences cancer processes through calcium influx. Understanding TRPV1's multifaceted roles in cancer may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for managing cancer-related symptoms and improving patient outcomes. The current review elucidates the comprehensive role of capsaicin in cancer therapy, particularly through the TRPV1 channel, highlighting its effects in various cells via different signaling pathways and discussing its limitations.",

However, few targeting ligands and hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) inhibit the CAR-T cells' survival and infiltration. An in situ hyaluronic acid‑manganese-capsaicin complex nanogel (HA-Mn-CAP Gel) was designed by forming complex nanogel based on the main skeleton material of hyaluronic acid (HA). It targeted CD44 and TRPV1 receptors through HA and CAP, concentrated and released Mn at melanoma, subsequently relieving the hypoxia in the tumor and increasing the expression of CAR-T cells' specific ligands. Cell experiments showed that HA-Mn-CAP Gel significantly enhanced the expression of representative NKG2D ligands (MICA/B and ULBP2/5/6) >2.7 times on A375 melanoma cells. Sequential administration of HA-Mn-CAP Gel and NKG2D/CAR-T increased the tumor inhibition rate about 1.5 times that of the NKG2D/CAR-T group in melanoma-bearing NSG mice. The results of immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays showed that the combined HA-Mn-CAP Gel and NKG2D/CAR-T significantly increased the proliferation and infiltration of T cells, especially for CD8+ cells. Therefore, the new promising strategy of increasing the target ligand expression and adjusting TME before administering CAR-T cells is suitable for treating solid tumors.",

      "abstract": "Background The leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide is lung cancer. Approximately 1.8 million new cases were diagnosed, and 1.6 million individuals died. Available treatment options are inefficient leading to tumour recurrence. Hence there is a need for novel therapeutic advancements in lung cancer treatment. Capsaicin, a naturally occurring protoalkaloid, was found to possess several potential benefits. Aim The aim of the study was to examine capsaicin's cytotoxic and anti-cancer effects in the lung cancer cell line (A549). Materials and methods The cell viability of lung cancer cells treated with capsaicin was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. A549 cells were treated with capsaicin at concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 µM/mL for 24 hours. Changes in cell morphology were observed using a phase-contrast microscope. Nuclear morphological alterations in the lung cancer cells were examined through acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) staining and viewed under a fluorescent microscope to identify apoptotic nuclei. Gene expression analysis was performed using quantitative real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) to evaluate the expression of apoptotic genes, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic 2 (SMAD2). Capsaicin's anti-migratory properties were assessed using a scratch wound healing assay. Result Our study demonstrated that treating lung cancer cells with capsaicin dramatically decreased their vitality, with a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the treatment and control groups. In lung cancer cells, we measured the inhibitory concentration (IC-50) at 101.2μM/ml. Following treatment, the number of cells decreased, and those that remained exhibited cytoplasmic membrane blebbing and shrunk. With AO/EtBr staining, treated cells showed an increased number of apoptotic cells. The study's findings showed that after receiving capsaicin, there was a significant downregulation of TGF-β and SMAD2. Moreover, when compared to control cells, capsaicin-treated cells' migration was markedly reduced. Through modification of the TGF-β/SMAD2 signaling system, capsaicin therapy dramatically promotes apoptosis and inhibits migration. Conclusion In conclusion, the study's results indicate that capsaicin may have anti-tumor effects on lung cancer cells. To fully comprehend the mechanism underlying capsaicin's anticancer potential and its therapeutic application, further studies are much needed."

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of capsaicin on atherosclerosis progression. METHODS: Apolipoprotein E knockout mice and their C57BL/6 controls were utilized to assess blood lipid profile, inflammatory status, and atherosclerotic lesions. We also examined the influence of capsaicin on cholesterol influx and efflux, and the role of TRPV1 and PPARγ signaling pathways in bone marrow-derived macrophages. RESULTS: Capsaicin treatment reduced weight gain, visceral adiposity, blood triglycerides, and total and non-HDL cholesterol. These improvements were associated with a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta and carotid. Capsaicin also improved hepatic oxidative and inflammatory status. Systemic inflammation was also reduced, as indicated by reduced leukocyte rolling and adhesion on the mesenteric plexus. Capsaicin decreased foam cell formation by reducing cholesterol influx through scavenger receptor A and increasing cholesterol efflux via ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, an effect primarily linked to TRPV1 activation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential of capsaicin as a promising agent for atherosclerosis prevention, highlighting its comprehensive role in modulating lipid metabolism, foam cell formation, and inflammatory responses.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Obesity is a complex multifaceted disease, characterized by excessive body fat accumulation. It is a major public health concern globally, affecting individuals of all ages, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Lipase, a key enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of dietary fats. Pancreatic lipase performs hydrolysis of nearly 50%-70% of total dietary fats. Thus, inhibition of pancreatic lipase is recognized as one of the strategies for managing obesity. Aim To predict the effect of phytocompounds from pepper as pancreatic lipase inhibitors using computational approaches. Methodology The drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties of compounds were evaluated using Lipinski rule of five and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) analysis, respectively. The drug score value was computed using Molinspiration, while the lipase inhibitor potential of ligands was evaluated using prediction of activity spectra for substances. Molecular docking was carried out to evaluate the stability and ligand binding affinity. Results Computational approaches identified both piperine and capsaicin as potential candidates, exhibiting favorable affinities with binding energy values of -9.9 and -7.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Both piperine and capsaicin interacted with Ser-152 and His-263, demonstrating their binding at the substrate binding site. Conclusions Findings provide insights into the underlying anti-obesity potential of these bioactive compounds from pepper and support further experimental investigations for obesity treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) following oral or intravenous chemotherapy often results in neuropathic pain, accompanied by symptoms such tingling, burning and hypersensitivity to stimuli, with a notable decline in quality of life (QoL). Effective therapies for CIPN are lacking, with a high demand for analgesics to address this issue. The QUCIP study aimed to assess the effectiveness of high concentration (179 mg) capsaicin patch (HCCP) in alleviating neuropathic pain and associated symptoms in breast cancer patients with confirmed CIPN. METHODS: QUCIP is a prospective, multi-center observational study spanning 36 weeks with up to three HCCP treatments. Initial treatment (visit V0) was followed by two telephone contacts (T1, T2) and subsequent face-to-face visits every 12 weeks or upon retreatment (visits V1-V3). 73 female patients with painful CIPN post neoadjuvant/adjuvant breast cancer therapy were enrolled. Primary endpoint was the reduction of neuropathic pain symptom score (painDETECT®). Secondary endpoints included improvements in CIPN-specific QoL (QLQ-CIPN20), reductions in pain intensity (numeric pain rating scale, NPRS), and achievement of ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% pain reduction. RESULTS: Median age was 61 years, with 52.0% of patients experiencing peripheral neuropathic pain for > 1 year (> 2 years: 34.2%). The painDETECT® score significantly decreased from baseline (19.71 ± 4.69) to 15.80 ± 6.20 after initial treatment (p < 0.0001) and continued to decrease at follow-up visits. The NPRS indicated significant pain intensity reduction at each time point, particularly pronounced in patients receiving three HCCP treatments. Clinically significant pain relief of ≥ 30% increased from 25.0% at week 4 (T2) to 36.2%, 43.5%, and 40.0% at weeks 12 (V1), 24 (V2), and 36 (V3), respectively. The percentage of patients achieving pain relief of ≥ 50% increased from 14.7% at T2 to 15.5%, 21.7% and 32.5% at V1, V2 and V3, respectively. Patients further reported a significant improvement in their CIPN-related QoL throughout the study. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) mainly included application site reactions. CONCLUSION: In this study, HCCP shows benefit in managing CIPN in real-world settings. The data demonstrate a sustained and progressive reduction in neuropathic pain and symptomatology, confirming the clinical benefit of repeated treatment observed in former clinical trials. HCCP treatment has also the potential to significantly improve the QoL associated with CIPN. The safety profile of HCCP was confirmed, supporting its use in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Capsaicin is the hot and pungent ingredient of chili peppers. It is a potent pain-relieving agent and is often present in over-the-counter analgesic lotions and creams. Several convergent studies reveal that capsaicin displays growth-suppressive activity in human cancers in vitro and in vivo. Apart from its growth-suppressive activity (as a single agent), capsaicin has been found to sensitize human cancer cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of chemotherapy and radiation. The first part of this book chapter discusses the anti-cancer activity of capsaicin in gynecological cancers in cell culture experiments and mouse models. Out of all gynecological cancers, the anti-cancer activity of capsaicin (and its analogs) has only been investigated in cervical cancers and ovarian cancers. The clinical development of capsaicin as a viable anti-cancer drug has remained challenging due to its poor bioavailability and aqueous solubility properties. In addition, the administration of capsaicin is associated with adverse side effects like gastrointestinal cramps, stomach pain, irritation in the gut, nausea diarrhea and vomiting. Two strategies have been investigated to overcome these drawbacks of capsaicin. The first is to encapsulate capsaicin in sustained release drug delivery systems. The second strategy is to design non-pungent capsaicin analogs which will retain the anti-tumor activity of capsaicin. The second part of this chapter provides an overview of the anti-neoplastic (and chemosensitization activity) of capsaicin analogs and capsaicin-based sustained release formulations in cervical and ovarian cancers. The design of selective non-pungent capsaicin analogs and capsaicin-based polymeric drug delivery systems may foster the hope of novel strategies for the treatment and management of gynecological cancers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We examined de-functionalization and temporal functional recovery of C-nociceptor evoked pain after topical 8% capsaicin applied for 4 consecutive days. METHODS: Capsaicin and placebo patches were applied to human forearm skin (n = 14). Cold, warmth and heat pain thresholds, pain NRS to electrical and thermal (48°C, 5 s) stimuli and axon reflex flare were recorded weekly for 49 days. Mechanical and heat sensitive ('polymodal') nociceptors were activated by single electrical half-period sinusoidal pulses (0.5 s, 1 Hz). Mechanical and heat insensitive ('silent') nociceptors were activated by 4 Hz sinusoidal stimuli. RESULTS: Capsaicin abolished heat pain. Sensation to electrical sinusoidal stimulation was reduced but never abolished during the treatment. Pain to electrical 1 Hz 'polymodal' nociceptor stimulation took longer to recover than pain ratings to 4 Hz 2.5 s sinusoidal stimulation activating 'polymodal' and 'silent' nociceptors (35 vs. 21 days). Heat pain was indifferent to placebo from day 21-49. Axon reflex flare was abolished during capsaicin and only recovered to ~50% even after 49 days. CONCLUSIONS: Capsaicin abolishes heat transduction at terminal nociceptive endings, whereas small-diameter axons sensitive to sinusoidal electrical stimulation can still be activated. 1 Hz depolarizing stimuli evoke burst discharges, as demonstrated before, and recover slower after capsaicin than single pulses induced by 4 Hz. The difference in recovery suggests differential time course of functional regeneration for C-nociceptor sub-types after capsaicin. All sensations recovered completely within 7 weeks in healthy subjects. Our findings contrast analgesia lasting for months in spontaneous neuropathic pain patients treated with 8% capsaicin. SIGNIFICANCE: Sinusoidal electrical stimulation can still activate small diameter axons desensitized to heat after 4 consecutive days of topical 8% capsaicin application and reveals differential temporal functional regeneration of C-nociceptor sub-types. Electrical sinusoidal stimulation may detect such axons that no longer respond to heat stimuli in neuropathic skin.",

This article examines the role of chili peppers, a common dietary component, in this context, focusing on capsaicin, the active ingredient in chili peppers. Capsaicin is an agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1 (TRPV1) and has been shown to exert protective effects on liver diseases, including liver injury, NAFLD, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. These protective effects are attributed to capsaicin's anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-steatosis and anti-fibrosis effects.

We conducted a comparative analysis between young and aged mice, with or without capsaicin supplementation, for 3 months. The effect of capsaicin was also studied in vitro in senescence-induced human oral keratinocytes. We found that aging did not reduce defensin levels uniformly but did so in some instances. Capsaicin treatment increased defensin levels in these cases, potentially through transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1)-mediated pathways in the oral cavity. Capsaicin supplementation may counteract age-related declines in oral defensin levels, enabling the maintenance of oral immune function during aging.",

The personal and societal impact of chronic pain in the survivor population represents an area of significant unmet need. Capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) may provide analgesia with limited systemic side effects. This review looks to summarise the most recent evidence regarding the use of capsaicin in the management of cancer pain. RECENT FINDINGS: Various international guidelines have recently endorsed the use of high concentration capsaicin patches in the treatment of chronic painful chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. Numerous studies support the use of capsaicin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. This promising data is predominantly yielded from pain secondary to herpes zoster and diabetic neuropathy, with an expanding but small evidence base for its utility in other neuropathic pains. Emerging data suggests that treatments are better tolerated and provide analgesia more rapidly when compared with systemic treatments. SUMMARY: Whilst randomised controlled trial data in the treatment of cancer pain are lacking, recent large cohort studies, and international guidelines, support the use of high concentration capsaicin patches in a wide variety of neuropathic pain secondary to cancer treatments.",

      "abstract": "Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors among oral cancers, and its treatment is based on radio-chemotherapy and surgery, which always produces more serious side effects and sequelae. Traditional medicine can compensate for the shortcomings of modern medical treatments and play a better therapeutic role. Currently, active ingredients derived from plants are attracting the attention of researchers and clinical professionals. We examined capsaicin (CAP), an active ingredient isolated from Capsicum annuum (family Solanaceae), and explored the effect of CAP combined with cisplatin (DDP) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and TSCC cells migration. Our results demonstrated that Transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1) induced EMT and promoted cell migration in TSCC cells. CAP combined with DDP inhibits non-TGF-β1-induced or TGF-β1-induced EMT and migration. Mechanistically, the inhibition of non-TGF-β1-induced EMT and migration by CAP combined with DDP was mediated by the AMPK/mTOR pathway, whereas TGF-β1-induced EMT and migration were regulated by the Claudin-1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. A nude lung metastasis mouse model was established for in vivo validation. These results support our hypothesis that the combination of CAP and DDP inhibits TSCC metastasis. These data set the stage for further studies aimed at validating CAP as an effective active ingredient for enhancing chemotherapy efficacy and reducing the dosage and toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs, ultimately paving the way for translational research and clinical trials for TSCC eradication."

This study was undertaken to determine the effect of preoperative systemic capsaicin on tooth sensitivity (TS) after in-office bleaching procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty participants received the treatment in this clinical trial. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 15). Placebo and 0.25% capsaicin were administered three times daily for 24 h, with the first dose being administrated 1 h before the bleaching procedure. The subjects underwent two bleaching sessions at a 2-week interval by applying 40% hydrogen peroxide gel on six upper anterior teeth. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate TS. Data were analyzed with SPSS 24. Statistical analyses were carried out with the Wilcoxon test and paired t-test. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: In the capsaicin group, there was a significant increase in TBS between the immediate and 1-h postoperative intervals and a significant decrease between 1- and 24-h postoperative intervals (P = 0.01 and P = 0.000, respectively). In the placebo group, there was a significant decrease between immediate and 24-h and between 1- and 24-h postoperative intervals (P = 0.007, P = 0.02). Milder TS was detected in the placebo group 24 h after bleaching (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Under the limitations of this study, preoperative use of systemic capsaicin did not significantly affect TS after the in-office bleaching procedure."

Cisplatin (DDP) is currently the first-line drug for the treatment of oral cancer; however, its clinical efficacy is impeded by chemoresistance and negligible side effects. Whether the combined use of CAP and DDP has a synergistic antitumor effect on tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cells and its underlying mechanisms remains unclear. The present study revealed that CAP reduced the activity of TSCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also observed changes in the mitochondrial functional structure of TSCC cells, along with the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, when CAP was combined with DDP, a synergistic cytotoxic effect on TSCC cells was observed, which had a significant impact on inducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential in TSCC cells compared to the single-drug treatment and control groups. These effects are associated with TRPV1, a high-affinity CAP receptor. The combined use of CAP and DDP can activate the TRPV1 receptor, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ overload and activation of the calpain pathway, ultimately leading to mitochondrial apoptosis. This potential mechanism was validated in TSCC xenograft models. In conclusion, our findings clearly demonstrate that CAP exerts synergistic pro-apoptotic effects with DDP in TSCC through the calpain pathway mediated by TRPV1. Thus, CAP can be considered an effective adjuvant drug for DDP in the treatment of TSCC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major 21st-century epidemic. T2DM elevates the risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure while also reducinges survival rates. Recently Ferroptosis has been found to be involved in the development of various cardiovascular diseases. TRPV1 is also a potential therapeutic target for cardioprotection. This study explores whether capsaicin, a transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) agonist, can prevent diabetic myocardial infarction-induced injury by inhibiting ferroptosis. METHODS: T2DM model was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with streptozocin (STZ) injections, and the diabetic mice were treated with capsaicin(0.015 %) in their food. Myocardial infarction model was established as well. Mouse' general characteristics, cardiac function, and morphological histology were observed and analyzed. RNA-seq was used to investigate the possible mechanism of injury in AC16 cardiomyocytes cultured with high glucose and hypoxia. In addition, the potential mechanism of capsaicin against injury was further investigated in AC16 cardiomyocytes cultured with high glucose and hypoxia. RESULTS: The RNA-seq analysis revealed that ferroptosis was associated with cell death induced by high-glucose in combination with hypoxia, and CAP treatment could effectively inhibit ferroptosis to enhance cell survival. In vivo studies demonstrated that CAP treatment significantly improved post-MI cardiac function, attenuated myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, it was observed that CAP reduced ferroptosis levels by activating TRPV1 in the heart, upregulating Nrf2 expression, promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increasing the expression of the Nrf2 downstream molecule Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary capsaicin may inhibit cardiomyocyte ferroptosis through activation of myocardial TRPV1 and Nrf2/HMOX1 signaling pathway, which in turn exerts a protective effect on the myocardium after myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic mice.",

Among the various defined molecular targets associated with obesity, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin play crucial roles in fundamental processes including energy balance, adipose tissue biology, and metabolic health, making them particularly significant in the study of obesity.Capsaicin and orange peel exhibit promising anti-obesity properties through their thermogenic, metabolic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Potential pathways for therapeutic approaches in the management of obesity are provided by these targets. The lipid-lowering and anti-obesity benefits of specific plant species have been highlighted in Asian medicine. Due to the potential anti-obesity qualities, capsaicin, which is derived from chilli peppers, and orange peel extract has been focused in this review. Capsaicin causes apoptosis in preadipocytes and adipocytes and suppresses adipogenesis. Citrus fruits are a significant source of bioactive substances, primarily flavonoids. Due to their ability to reduce adipocyte development and cellular lipid content, citrus polyphenols are helpful in the control of obesity. This extensive analysis offers insights into new treatment approaches for the prevention and management of obesity and metabolic syndrome by examining the interactions of molecular variables in obesity as well as the possible anti-obesity advantages of capsaicin and orange peel extract.",

      "abstract": "Research has been conducted investigating the neuronal pathways responsible for the generation of chronic neuropathic pain, including the components of it in conditions such as chronic post-surgical pain, phantom limb pain, and cluster headaches. Forming part of the management of such conditions, capsaicin as a molecule has proven effective. This review has investigated the central nervous system modifications exhibited in such conditions and the pharmacological mechanisms of capsaicin relevant to this. The current paradigm for explaining topical capsaicin-induced analgesia is that TRPV1-mediated calcium ion influx induces calpain, in turn causing axonal ablation and functional defunctionalisation in the PNS (Peripheral Nervous System). Demonstrated through the analysis of existing data, this review demonstrates the changes seen in the CNS (Central Nervous System) in chronic neuropathic pain, as well as some of the evidence for capsaicin modulation on the CNS. Further supporting this, the specific molecular mechanisms of capsaicin-induced analgesia will also be explored, including the action of TRPV1, as well as discussing the further need for clinical research into this area of uncertainty due to the limited specific data with suitable parameters. Further research this review identified as potentially useful in this field included fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) studies, though more specific observational studies of patients who have already been administered capsaicin as a current treatment may prove helpful in studying the modification of the CNS in the long term."

Materials and Methods: Male Wistar albino rats weighing between 250 and 300 g were used in this study. Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into three equal groups: implant + control (n = 8), implant + capsaicin-1 (n = 8), and implant + capsaicin-2 (n = 8). Additionally, 2.5 mm diameter and 4 mm length titanium implants were surgically integrated into the corticocancellous bone parts of the femurs. In the treatment groups, rats were injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg (implant + capsaicin-1) and 50 mg/kg (implant + capsaicin-2) of capsaicin. No additional applications were made in the control group. Three rats in total died during and after the experiment as a result of the analyses performed on 21 animals. Results: The highest total antioxidant status value was found in capsaicin dose 2, according to the analysis. The control group had the highest total oxidant status and oxidative stress index values, while group 2 of capsaicin had the lowest. After analysis, we found that there was no observed positive effect on osteointegration in this study (p > 0.05), although the bone implant connection was higher in the groups treated with capsaicin. Conclusions: A positive effect on osteointegration was not observed in this study. This may be due to osteoclast activation. However, it was found that it has a positive effect on oxidative stress. Osteoclast activation may be the cause of this phenomenon. Capsaicin was found to have a positive effect on oxidative stress (p < 0.05). It was also observed to have a positive effect on oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Successful aerosol therapy might rely more heavily on proper drug delivery than on the effectiveness of the medication. This study compared four techniques for nebulization delivery in cats. Tolerance rate (TR) was subjectively evaluated (1-3). Increasing capsaicin concentrations were nebulized for objective evaluation of efficiency. The positive response (PR) was considered when more than five coughs were induced. The following delivery methods were tested: flow-by (FB); face mask (FM); plastic-covered Elizabethan collar (EC); and plexiglass chamber (PC). The number of PRs (NPR) and the concentration of capsaicin that induced a PR (CCP) were statistically compared (p < 0.05). The PC method was the best tolerated (TR = 3.0 ± 0.0), followed by the FB (2.7 ± 0.5) and FM (2.6 ± 0.5). The EC was very stressful, and the test had to be suspended in four out of nine cats. The lowest CCP was found with the FM (91.8 ± 157.2 µM), followed by the FB (166.7 ± 190.9 µM), PC (242.6 ± 244.8 µM), and EC (350.0 ± 225.7 µM), with significant differences only between the FM and EC (p = 0.02). The highest NPR (8) corresponded to the FM, followed by the FB (7), the PC (5), and the EC (3), with significant differences between the FM and EC (p = 0.016). In conclusion, the capsaicin cough test induces reproducible and quantifiable cat responses. The FM is the most efficient for nebulization delivery, offering good compliance and the best quantitative results. FB nebulization is less efficient but may be practical if the FM is not tolerated. PC offers minor efficiency but may be useful for very stressed or aggressive cats. The EC presents low efficiency and compliance."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the efficacy and mechanism of traditionally made kochujang(TMK) with different capsaicin levels to alleviate memory impairment in rats with scopolamine-induced amnesia. Sprague-Dawley male rats were administered scopolamine (2 mg/kg bw/day) intraperitoneally to suppress the parasympathetic nervous system(PNS) and induce memory impairment. The rats were divided into four experimental groups, each consuming a diet containing 1 % kochujang in a 43-energy% high-fat diet(HFD) for 8 weeks. The TMK samples used for the study were categorized according to their capsaicin(CPS) content as follows: Low-CPS(0.5 mg%), medium-CPS(1.2 mg%), and high-CPS(1.7 mg%). In addition, factory-made kochujang (FMK; 1.1 mg% capsaicin) was also tested. The effects of kochujang were compared with the Control group(scopolamine), Positive-control(scopolamine+donepezil), and Normal-control(saline) fed HFD. Kochujang consumption reduced body weight and fat mass compared to the Control group. Compared to the Control, memory function measured using passive avoidance, water maze, and novel object recognition tests was enhanced in kochujang-fed rats, especially in the Medium-CPS group, similar to Positive-control. The Medium-CPS and Positive-control groups also exhibited inhibition of hippocampal cell death and increased cholesterol and triglyceride contents and mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in the brain tissue compared to the Control group. Additionally, TMK elevated short-chain fatty acid, particularly, butyrate concentration in the portal vein. Scopolamine disturbed large intestine cell morphology and gut microbiota composition, and kochujang improved them. Kochujang in the medium-CPS (1.2 mg%) had a more significant impact on the gut microbiota in the interaction analysis between gut microbiota and memory function. In conclusion, kochujang, especially with medium-CPS (1.2 mg%), is a potential dietary intervention to mitigate memory impairment and promote overall cognitive health through improving eubiosis, potentially linked to the gut-brain axis in PNS-suppressed rats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long term hypertension seriously promotes target organ damage in the brain and heart, and has increasingly become serious public health problem worldwide. The anti-hypertensive effects of capsaicin has been reported, however, the role and mechanism of capsaicin within the brain on salt-induced hypertension have yet to be elucidated. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that capsaicin attenuates salt-induced hypertension via the AMPK/Akt/Nrf2 pathway in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). METHODS: Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) rats were used as animal model for the present study. Rats were randomly divided into four groups based on their dietary regimen (0.3% normal salt diet and 8% high salt diet) and treatment methods (infusion of vehicle or capsaicin in the PVN). Capsaicin was chronically administered in the PVN throughout the animal experiment phase of the study that lasted 6 weeks. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that PVN pretreatment with capsaicin can slow down raise of the blood pressure elevation and heart rate (HR) of Dahl S hypertensive rats given high salt diet. Interestingly, the cardiac hypertrophy was significantly improved. Furthermore, PVN pretreatment with capsaicin induced decrease in the expression of mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NOX4, p-IKKβ and proinflammatory cytokines and increase in number of positive cell level for Nrf2 and HO-1 in the PVN of Dahl S hypertensive rats. Additionally, the protein expressions of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K) and phosphorylated protein kinase-B (p-AKT) were decreased, phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) were increased after the PVN pretreatment with capsaicin. CONCLUSION: Capsaicin pretreatment attenuates salt-sensitive hypertension by alleviating AMPK/Akt/iNOS pathway in the PVN."

Based on this, it is playing an increasingly important role in the field of oncology due to its good efficacy and small side effects. However, the regulation of calcium homeostasis by cancer cells themselves, insufficient calcium ions (Ca2+) in tumor sites and low efficiency of calcium entering tumor have limited its efficacy, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Therefore, a novel CAP/BSA@TCP-ZIF-8 nanoparticle drug carrier system was constructed that can provide Ca2+ from exogenous sources for pH-controlled degradation and drug release at the same time. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have proved that the nanomaterial can activate TRPV1 channels and provide exogenous Ca2+ to cause Ca2+ overload and apoptosis, thus achieving anti-tumor effects.",

In this research, a biocompatible fluorescent multifunctional nanocarrier is designed for the co-delivery of capsaicin (CPS) and nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) using the pH sensitive amphiphilic block copolymer (poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone), PEtOx-b-PCL). The effects of the critical formulation parameters (the amount of copolymer, the concentration of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a stabilizing agent in the inner aqueous phase, and volume of the inner phase) are evaluated to achieve optimal nanoparticle (NP) properties using Central Composite Design. The optimized NPs demonstrated a desirable size distribution (167.8 ± 1.4 nm) with a negative surface charge (-19.9 ± 0.4) and a suitable loading capacity for CPS (70.80 ± 0.05%). The CPS & N-GQD NPs are found to have remarkable toxicity on human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7). The solid fluorescent signal is acquired from cells containing multifunctional NPs, according to the confocal microscope imaging results, confirming the significant cellular uptake. This research illustrates the enormous potential for cellular imaging and enhanced cancer therapy offered by multifunctional nanocarriers that combine drug substances with the novel fluorescent agents.",

      "abstract": "Loss of tear homeostasis, characterized by hyperosmolarity of the ocular surface, induces cell damage through inflammation and oxidation. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a sensor for osmotic changes, plays a crucial role as a calcium ion channel in the pathogenesis of hypertonic-related eye diseases. Capsaicin (CAP), a potent phytochemical, alleviates inflammation during oxidative stress events by activating TRPV1. However, the pharmacological use of CAP for eye treatment is limited by its pungency. Nitro dihydrocapsaicin (NDHC) was synthesized with aromatic ring modification of CAP structure to overcome the pungent effect. We compared the molecular features of NDHC and CAP, along with their biological activities in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, focusing on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The results demonstrated that NDHC maintained cell viability, cell shape, and exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared to CAP-treated cells. Moreover, NDHC prevented oxidative stress and inflammation in HCE cells following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. These findings underscore the beneficial effect of NDHC in alleviating ocular surface inflammation, suggesting that NDHC may serve as an alternative anti-inflammatory agent targeting TRPV1 for improving hyperosmotic stress-induced ocular surface damage.",

In-vitro study with N2a cells was performed through MTT and LDH assay and their biochemical examinations were also performed. 3-NP-administered mice (n = 6) were treated with capsaicin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) through the per-oral (p.o.) route for 7 consecutive days. Physiological and behavioral studies were performed in drug-treated mice. After behavioral studies, biochemical parameters were performed for cytokines levels, various oxidative stress parameters, and mitochondrial enzyme complex activities with mitochondrial permeability. N2a cells treated with capsaicin demonstrated neuroprotective effects and reduced neurotoxicity. Based on experimental observation, in an in-vitro study, the effective dose of CAP was 50 µM. Moreover, a 100 µM dose of capsaicin had toxic effects on neuronal cells (N2a cells). On the other hand, the effective dose of 3-NP was 20 mg/kg, (p.o.) in animals (in-vivo). All tested doses of capsaicin upturned the cognitive impairment and motor in-coordination effects induced by 3-NP. 3-NP-injected mice demonstrated substantially increased pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations, defective mitochondrial complex activity, and augmented oxidative insult. However, capsaicin at different doses reduced oxidative damage and cytokines levels and improved mitochondrial complex activity along with mitochondrial permeability. Furthermore, capsaicin (10 and 20 mg/kg) improved the TNF-α concentration. These findings suggested because of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect, capsaicin can be considered a novel treatment for the management of neurodegenerative disorders by reverting the antioxidant enzyme activity, pro-inflammatory cytokines concentration, and mitochondrial functions.",

The conflicting data on its inflammatory role, suggesting both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects upon TRPV1 stimulation in immune cells, adds complexity. To unravel TRPV1 immunomodulatory mechanisms, we investigated how the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin influences lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotypes. RESULTS: Changes in the surface molecules, cytokine production, and signaling cascades linked to the phenotype of M1 or M2 macrophages of the J774 macrophage cell line and bone marrow-derived macrophages, treated with capsaicin before or after the LPS-induced inflammatory reaction were determined. The functional capacity of macrophages was also assessed by infecting the stimulated macrophages with the intracellular parasite Leishmania mexicana. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that TRPV1 activation yields distinct macrophage responses influenced by the inflammatory context. LPS pre-treatment followed by capsaicin activation prompted increased calcium influx, accompanied by a shift toward an anti-inflammatory M2b-like polarization state."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The objective was to critically appraise the efficacy and safety of topical capsaicin in reducing pain in OA. MEDLINE (PubMed) and Embase (Ebsco) were searched from inceptions until February 2023. The eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), evaluating topical capsaicin in OA patients. Standard Cochrane methods were used to extract data and to appraise eligible studies. Eight double-blind RCTs involving 498 patients were included. Five trials (62.5%) were at an overall low risk of bias, and three (37.5%) were at a high risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that, in various OA patients, compared with placebo, topical capsaicin (0.0125%-5%) may reduce pain severity measured with visual analog scale (standardized mean difference = -0.84, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = -1.48 to -0.19, p = 0.01; eight studies). However, topical capsaicin may increase burning sensation at the application site (risk ratio = 5.56, 95% CI = 1.75-17.69, p = 0.004, numbers needed to harm = 3; five studies) when compared with placebo. Limitations include short study durations, small sample sizes, high heterogeneity, and overall low-to-very-low certainty of the evidence. Topical capsaicin may reduce OA pain at follow-ups of up to 3 months. Larger trials, potentially evaluating capsaicin in combination with phytopharmaceuticals having anti-inflammatory effects, with longer follow-ups might be needed to reduce the existing uncertainties. Topical capsaicin might be recommended for short-term management of pain in OA patients intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",

Capsaicin (CAP) can enhance the anti-tumor activity of cytotoxic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-metastasis activity of CAP in combination with DDP in NPC. Herein, CAP and DDP showed synergistic cytotoxic effects on NPC cells. CAP alone and DDP alone inhibited NPC migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, and the combination of CAP and DDP had the greatest effect. Moreover, CAP upregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of serpin family B member 2 (SERPINB2). Further results showed that both SERPINB2 mRNA and protein expressions were downregulated in NPC cell lines and tissues and SERPINB2 overexpression inhibited NPC migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, while silencing SERPINB2 acted oppositely. In addition, SERPINB2 was abnormally expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and other multiple cancers, and downregulation of SERPINB2 predicted poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma according to the Cancer Genome Atlas database. We further found that SERPINB2 overexpression inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), and the inhibitory effect was enhanced by CAP and DDP. Altogether, our results suggest that the combined inhibition of CAP and DDP on NPC metastasis may be related to the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and ERK signals mediated by SERPINB2, and CAP may help to improve the efficacy of DDP in the treatment of NPC and develop new therapeutic approaches.",

Capsaicin has been found to exert a positive effect on vitiligo treatment, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are also confirmed to be an ideal cell type. This study aimed to explore the influence of capsaicin combined with stem cells on the treatment of vitiligo and to confirm the molecular mechanism of capsaicin combined with stem cells in treating vitiligo. METHODS AND RESULTS: PIG3V cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using CCK-8 and TUNEL assays, MitoSOX Red fluorescence staining was used to measure the mitochondrial ROS level, and JC-1 staining was used to detect the mitochondrial membrane potential. The expression of related genes and proteins was detected using RT‒qPCR and Western blotting. Coimmunoprecipitation was used to analyze the protein interactions between HSP70 and TLR4 or between TLR4 and mTOR. The results showed higher expression of HSP70 in PIG3V cells than in PIG1 cells. The overexpression of HSP70 reduced the proliferation of PIG3V cells, promoted apoptosis, and aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy abnormalities. The expression of HSP70 could be inhibited by capsaicin combined with MSCs, which increased the levels of Tyr, Tyrp1 and DCT, promoted the proliferation of PIG3V cells, inhibited apoptosis, activated autophagy, and improved mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, capsaicin combined with MSCs regulated the expression of TLR4 through HSP70 and subsequently affected the mTOR/FAK signaling pathway CONCLUSIONS: Capsaicin combined with MSCs inhibits TLR4 through HSP70, and the mTOR/FAK signaling pathway is inhibited to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy abnormalities in PIG3V cells.",

This entity's connections with other signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-B, and TRPV channels, which have been linked to tumor growth, are thoroughly examined in this work. This study presents a thorough analysis of preclinical studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy of capsaicin in treating many forms of cancer, such as breast, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and others. Through tests conducted in both live organisms and laboratory settings, it has been determined that capsaicin has the ability to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. (in vitro and in vivo). Researchers have also looked at the results of combining capsaicin with chemotherapy medications in traditional treatment. The efficacy and bioavailability of capsaicin as a viable medicinal drug are being studied, along with ways to improve its clinical value. The present investigation carefully assesses the challenges and potential options for maximizing the therapeutic benefits of capsaicin, including customized drug delivery and personalized therapeutic strategies. In finalization, this comprehensive investigation brings together the evidence currently obtainable on the anticancer properties of capsaicin, underscoring its potential as an autonomous treatment option in the struggle against cancer. Capsaicin is a compound of significant relevance for continuing research and clinical exploration in the field of cancer treatment due to its diverse mechanisms of action and ability for boosting prevailing therapy approaches.",

      "abstract": "Cisplatin is commonly used for the chemotherapy of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC); however, adverse side effects and drug resistance impact its therapeutic efficacy. Capsaicin is an active ingredient in chili peppers that exerts antitumor effects, whether it exerts antitumor effects on cisplatin-resistant cells remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of capsaicin on cisplatin resistance in TSCC cells and explored the underlying mechanisms. A cisplatin-resistant TSCC cell line was established by treated with increasing cisplatin concentrations. Combined treatment with cisplatin and capsaicin decreased the glucose consumption and lactate dehydrogenase activity and increased the adenosine triphosphate production both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the inhibition of the Warburg effect. Moreover, this combined treatment induced cell apoptosis and significantly upregulated the levels of proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax, cleaved caspase-3, -7, and -9, and apoptosis-inducing factor. In contrast, levels of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, were downregulated. Additionally, LKB1 and AMPK activities were stimulated, whereas those of AKT and mTOR were suppressed. Notably, AMPK knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of capsaicin and cisplatin on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and Warburg effect. Overall, combined treatment with capsaicin and cisplatin reversed cisplatin resistance by inhibiting the Warburg effect and facilitating mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis via the AMPK/AKT/mTOR axis. Our findings suggest combination therapy with capsaicin and cisplatin as a potentially novel strategy and highlight capsaicin as a promising adjuvant drug for TSCC treatment.",

Twenty seven (27) nano-cubosomal dispersions were prepared according to Box-Behnken factorial design and the effect of CAP, TCS, glyceryl mono oleate (GMO) and poloxamer 407 (P407) concentrations on particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency were assessed. The results revealed that the optimized formulation exhibited a mean droplet size of 503 ± 10.3 nm, PDI of 0.405 ± 0.02, zeta potential of -10.0 ± 1.70 mV and entrapment efficiency of 86.9 ± 3.56 %. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of optimized formulation was studied in rats by injecting carrageenan to induce edema. The results of in vivo study showed that transdermal application of nano-cubosomes co-loaded with CAP and TCS significantly (p value < 0.05) improved carrageenan induced inflammation compared with standard treatment. The analgesic activity of optimized formulation was evaluated in rats by using Eddy's hot plate method. The findings of analgesic activity illustrated that the analgesic effects exhibited by test formulation may be associated with increased licking period and inhibition of prostaglandins level. In conclusion, the transdermal application of NCs co-loaded with CAP and TCS may be a promising delivery system for enhancing their bioavailability as well as synergistic analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in gout management."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myoglobin (Mb) in duck meat is commonly over-oxidized when heated at high temperatures, which may worsen the color of the meat. Enhancing the oxidative stability of Mb is essential for improving the color of duck meat. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin (CA-DI) in chili exhibit antioxidant properties. This study investigated the effects of CA-DI on the structure and oxidative damage of Mb by fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry analysis and particle size in duck meat during heat treatment. RESULTS: When the ratio of CA-DI to Mb was 10:1 g kg-1 and heat-treated for 36 min, oxymyoglobin significantly increased, and metmyoglobin significantly decreased compared with the control group (P < 0.05). In parallel, the carbonyl content of Mb in the CA-DI group decreased by 43.40 ± 0.10%, the sulfhydryl content increased by 188 ± 0.21%, and the free radical scavenging activity of Mb was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05). Moreover, the addition of CA-DI resulted in a significant decrease in the particle size of the Mb surface (P < 0.05). When the ratio of CA-DI to Mb was 10:1 g kg-1, CA-DI enhanced the thermal stability and significantly increased the thermal denaturation temperature of Mb. The molecular docking results indicated that hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds were involved in the binding of CA-DI to Mb. CONCLUSION: CA-DI could combine with Mb and improve the oxidation stability of Mb in duck meat. This suggested that CA-DI could be a potential natural antioxidant that improves the color of meat products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Capsaicin 179 mg (8% weight per weight) cutaneous patch (\"capsaicin patch\") is a recommended topical treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP). In older patients, topical treatments may be preferred over systemic treatments, but data specific to the older population are scarce. METHODS: We conducted pooled analyses of multiple clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety of capsaicin patch in older patients. The analysis of efficacy included four randomized, double-blind, 12-week studies with similar trial design comparing a single treatment of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch vs low-dose control patch in post-herpetic neuralgia. For the safety evaluation, data were pooled from 18 interventional studies in which capsaicin patch was used in PNP with varying etiologies. RESULTS: Capsaicin patch had similar analgesic efficacy in elderly (n=582) and non-elderly patients (n=545) in terms of change from baseline to 2-12 weeks in the 11-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) score for average pain over the previous 24 hours. In both age groups, decrease in NPRS score was significantly greater with capsaicin patch vs control. Older patients treated with capsaicin patch were significantly more likely than those in the control group to achieve responder status (ie mean decrease in NPRS score from baseline to week 2-12 of at least 30% or ≥2 points): 36.1% vs 27.1% (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI] 1.52 [1.06, 2.18]; P=0.0231) and 33.1% vs 20.9% (OR [95% CI] 1.90 [1.30, 2.78]; P=0.0009) for active treatment vs control group, respectively. Similar proportions of non-elderly patients (n=2,311) and elderly patients (n=537) treated with capsaicin patch experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (81.6% and 78.1%, respectively) and serious TEAEs (8.2% and 7.2%), with application-site reactions the most common TEAEs in both groups. CONCLUSION: The capsaicin patch was equally efficacious and well tolerated in older patients as in younger patients."

AIM: The present study evaluated tolerability and efficacy of topical capsaicin to treat neuroproliferative PVD. METHODS: Patients with neuroproliferative PVD prescribed 0.025% capsaicin compounded in VersaBase cream were identified through prescription records. Outcome measures included the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised, and a 22-question questionnaire assessing patient experience and treatment tolerability. OUTCOMES: Among tolerant patients, capsaicin significantly decreased vestibular pain, but tolerance was highly variable. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients responded to the follow-up questionnaire. The average age at presentation was 30 years (range, 18-52 years). Eighty percent of patients tolerated capsaicin application for the full 20 minutes within a median time of 1 to 2 weeks. Of the 16 patients reporting tolerance to 20-minute application, 12 (60%) experienced improvement in vestibular pain. On an 11-point numeric rating scale, the mean pain score was 8.96 and the median score was 10 with first application. Among all participants, 16 (64%) had reduction in pain during treatment. Fifty-six percent of patients would recommend capsaicin as a treatment for vulvar pain. Qualitative content analysis focused on categories of efficacy, value, and feasibility, which indicated that those able to tolerate the treatment experienced improvement while using the medication. The mean Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised score was 35.96 at baseline compared with 25.09 at follow-up (P < .0001). On a numeric rating scale, the mean self-reported vulvar pain score was 8.2 at baseline compared with 5.35 when using capsaicin consistently (P < .0001). The mean FSFI pain domain score was 2.45 at baseline compared with 0.98 at follow-up (P = .005). While not statistically significant, the mean total FSFI score was 15.44 at baseline compared with 17.84 at follow-up (P = .3730). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Capsaicin is helpful for some patients with PVD, but thorough counseling is important because of highly variable tolerance. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Strengths include examination of a poorly studied therapy and inclusion of narrative responses from patients to inform counseling. Limitations include small sample size, retrospective design, and low survey response rate. CONCLUSION: Patients should be appropriately selected and thoroughly counseled given high levels of intolerance, but capsaicin therapy may be considered for patients with neuroproliferative PVD who have failed conservative treatments and wish to avoid surgery."

However, its effect on ATP-dependent thermogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we employed qRT-PCR, immunoblot, staining method, and assay kit to investigate the role of CAP on ATP-dependent thermogenesis and its modulatory roles on the TRPV1, β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR), and α1-AR using in vitro and in vivo models. The studies showed that CAP treatment in high-fat diet-induced obese mice resulted in lower body weight gain and elevated ATP-dependent thermogenic effectors' protein and gene expression through ATP-consuming calcium and creatine futile cycles. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, CAP treatment elevated the protein and gene expressions of sarcoendoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), creatine kinase B (CKB), and creatine kinase mitochondrial 2 (CKMT2) mediated by the activation of β3-AR, α1-AR, and TRPV1. Our study showed that CAP increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and the expression of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) which indicates that increased mitochondrial Ca2+ levels lead to increased expression of oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes as a result of ATP-futile cycle activation. A mechanistic study in 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed that CAP induces UCP1- and ATP-dependent thermogenesis mediated by the β3-AR/PKA/p38MAPK/ERK as well as calcium-dependent α1-AR/TRPV1/CaMKII/AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. Taken together, we identified CAP's novel functional and modulatory roles in UCP1- and ATP-dependent thermogenesis, which is important for developing therapeutic strategies for combating obesity and metabolic diseases."

      "abstract": "Vascular calcification (VC) is an accurate risk factor and predictor of adverse cardiovascular events; however, there is currently no effective therapy to specifically prevent VC progression. Capsaicin (Cap) is a bioactive alkaloid isolated from Capsicum annuum L., a traditional medicinal and edible plant that is beneficial for preventing cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of Cap on VC remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects and related mechanisms of Cap on aortic calcification in a mouse and on Pi-induced calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). First, we established a calcification mouse model with vitamin D3 and evaluated the effects of Cap on calcification mice using von Kossa staining, calcium content, and alkaline phosphatase activity tests. The results showed that Cap significantly improved calcification in mice. VSMCs were then cultured in 2.6 mM Na2HPO4 and 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid for 7 days to obtain a calcification model, and we investigated the effects and mechanisms of Cap on VSMCs calcification by assessing the changes of calcium deposition, calcium content, and subsequent VC biomarkers. These results showed that Cap alleviated VSMCs calcification by upregulating the expressions of TRPV1. Moreover, Cap reduced the expression of Wnt3a and β-catenin, whereas DKK1 antagonised the inhibitory effect of Cap on VSMC calcification. This study is the first to offer direct evidence that Cap inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by upregulating the expression of the TRPV1 receptor, resulting in the decreased expression of Runx2 and BMP-2, thereby reducing VSMC calcification. Our study may provide novel strategies for preventing the progression of VC. This could serve as a theoretical basis for clinically treating VC with spicy foods."

      "abstract": "Methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive metabolic byproduct of glycolysis, is a causative of painful diabetic neuropathy. Patients with diabetes are associated with more frequent severe asthma exacerbation. Stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive lung vagal (CSLV) afferents may contribute to the pathogenesis of hyperreactive airway diseases such as asthma. However, the possibility of the stimulatory effect of MG on CSLV afferents and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Our results showed that intravenous injection of MG (25 mg/kg, MG25) in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats elicited pulmonary chemoreflexes characterized by apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension. The MG-induced apneic response was reproducible and dose dependent. MG25 no longer evoked these reflex responses after perineural capsaicin treatment of both cervical vagi to block C-fibers' conduction, suggesting that the reflexes were mediated through the stimulation of CSLV afferents. Pretreatment with HC030031 [an antagonist of transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 protein (TRPA1)] or AP18 (another TRPA1 antagonist), but not their vehicle, markedly attenuated the apneic response induced by MG25. Consistently, electrophysiological results showed that pretreatment with HC030031 largely attenuated the intense discharge in CSLV afferents induced by injection of MG25 in open-chest and artificially ventilated rats. In isolated CSLV neurons, the perfusion of MG evoked an abrupt and pronounced increase in calcium transients in a concentration-dependent manner. This stimulatory effect on CSLV neurons was also abolished by HC030031 treatment but not by its vehicle. In conclusion, these results suggest that MG exerts a stimulatory effect on CSLV afferents, inducing pulmonary chemoreflexes, and such stimulation is mediated through the TRPA1 activation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Methylglyoxal (MG) is implicated in the development of painful diabetic neuropathy. A retrospective cohort study revealed an increased incidence of asthma exacerbations in patients with diabetes. This study demonstrated that elevated circulating MG levels stimulate capsaicin-sensitive lung vagal afferents via activation of TRPA1, which in turn triggers respiratory reflexes. These findings provide new information for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of diabetes-associated hyperreactive airway diseases and potential therapy.",

      "abstract": "Human transferrin (htf) plays a crucial role in regulating the balance of iron within brain cells; any disruption directly contributes to the development of Neurodegenerative Diseases (NDs) and other related pathologies, especially Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In recent times, a transition towards natural compounds is evident to treat diseases and this shift is mainly attributed to their broad therapeutic potential along with minimal side effects. Capsaicin, a natural compound abundantly found in red and chili peppers, possess neuroprotective potential. The current work targets to decipher the interaction mechanism of capsaicin with htf using experimental and computational approaches. Molecular docking analysis revealed that capsaicin occupies the iron binding pocket of htf, with good binding affinity. Further, the binding mechanism was investigated atomistically using Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation approach. The results revealed no significant alterations in the structure of htf implying the stability of the complex. In silico observations were validated by fluorescence binding assay. Capsaicin binds to htf with a binding constant (K) of 3.99 × 106 M-1, implying the stability of the htf-capsaicin complex. This study lays a platform for potential applications of capsaicin in treatment of NDs in terms of iron homeostasis."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of a phytoformulation consisting of hydroxycitric acid and capsaicin against obesity-related cardiomyopathy. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed HFD for 21 weeks, and phytoformulation (100 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally for 45 days starting at week 16. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that HFD supplementation resulted in significant hyperglycemia and caused an increase in cardiac lipid deposition, inflammation and apoptosis in the heart. Phytoformulation therapy not only significantly decreased blood levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and inflammatory cytokines in obese rats, but also protected cardiac tissue, as shown by histological analysis. Conversely, phytoformulation therapy decreased mRNA levels for sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid binding protein 1 genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and absorption in obese rats. It increased the levels of lysosomal acid lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, and lipoprotein lipase genes involved in fatty acid degradation in the heart. In addition, the phytoformulation improved cardiac inflammation and apoptosis by downregulating the genes nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), tumour necrosis factor α, interleukin-6, toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), BCL2-associated X and caspase-3. In conclusion, our results show that the phytoformulation improved insulin sensitivity and attenuated myocardial lipid accumulation, inflammation, and apoptosis in the heart of HFD-induced obese rats by regulating fatty acid metabolism genes and downregulating NF-kB/TLR-4/caspase-3."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the therapeutic potential of Capsaicin as an additional treatment to enhance patient tolerance to Bleomycin compared to the antifibrotic drug Pirfenidone. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced in rats through by a single intratracheal Bleomycin administration in day zero, followed by either Capsaicin or Pirfenidone treatment for 7 days. After the animals were sacrificed, their lungs were dissected and examined using various stains for macroscopic and histopathological evaluation. Additionally, the study assessed various antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic parameters were assessed. Rats exposed to Bleomycin exhibited visible signs of fibrosis, histopathological alterations, increased collagen deposition, and elevated mucin content. Bleomycin also led to heightened increased inflammatory cells infiltration in the bronchoalveolar lavage, elevated fibrosis biomarkers such as hydroxyproline, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1), increased inflammatory markers including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interlukine-6 (Il-6), interlukine-1β (Il-1β) nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1),. Furthermore, it reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), increased oxidative stress biomarkers like nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and protein carbonyl. Bleomycin also decreased the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), reduced glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity, and the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Treating the animals with Capsaicin and Pirfenidone following Bleomycin exposure resulted in improved lung macroscopic and microscopic characteristics, reduced collagen deposition (collagen I and collagen III) and mucin content, decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, lowered levels of hydroxyproline, α-SMA, and TGF-β1, decreased TNF-α, Il-6, Il-1β, NF-κB, and COX-2, increased PPAR-γ and Nrf-2 expression, and improvement improved in all oxidative stress biomarkers. In summary, Capsaicin demonstrates significant antifibrotic activity against Bleomycin-induced lung injury that may be attributed, at least in part, to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of Capsaicin mediated by upregulation of PPAR-γ and Nrf-2 expression and decreasing. TGF-β1, NF-κB and COX II proteins concentrations."

      "abstract": "Obesity is often accompanied by increased adipose tissue inflammation, a process that is partially driven by adipose tissue-resident macrophages. In this study, we explored the potential for plant-derived dietary compounds to exert anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages that alleviate obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction. Capsaicin (CAP), schisandrin A (SA), enterodiol (END), and enterolactone (ENL) treatment polarized J774 macrophages to an \"M2\" or anti-inflammatory phenotype and inhibited responses to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, these compounds blocked inflammasome activation when administered just before ATP-induced NLRP3 activation, as evidenced by the abrogation of IL-1β release in mouse macrophages and human peripheral blood monocytes. The addition of CAP, SA, or ENL during the differentiation of bone marrow-derived macrophages was also sufficient to inhibit LPS-induced IL-6 and TNFα production. Finally, CAP, END, and ENL treatment during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes induced an adiponectin-high phenotype accompanied by increases in thermogenic gene expression, and conditioned media from these adipocytes inhibited LPS-induced production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα from J774 macrophages. These polarizing effects were partially mediated by the elevated adiponectin and decreased syndecan-4 in the adipocyte-conditioned media. These results implicate the contribution of plant-derived dietary components to the modulation of macrophages and adipocytes in obesity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The utility of food-based products to prevent or alleviate chronic conditions such as obesity and its associated comorbidities is an attractive approach. Capsaicin, schisandrin A, enterodiol, and enterolactone, phytochemicals present in traditional medicinal food, decreased proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages that, in turn, reduced obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction. These results implicate the contribution of plant-derived dietary components to the modulation of macrophages and adipocytes in obesity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Capsaicin, a chili pepper extract, can stimulate increased skin blood flow (SkBF) with a perceived warming sensation on application areas. Larger surface area application may exert a more systemic thermoregulatory response. Capsaicin could assist with maintaining heat transport to the distal extremities, minimizing cold weather injury risk. However, the thermoregulatory and perceptual impact of topical capsaicin cream application prior to exercise in the cold is unknown. METHODS: Following application of either a 0.1% capsaicin or control cream to the upper and lower extremities (10 g total, ∼40-50% body surface area), 11 participants in shorts and a t-shirt were exposed to 30 min of cold (0 °C, 40% relative humidity). Exposures comprised of 5 min seated rest, 20 min walking (1.6 m·s-1, 5% grade), and 5 min seated rest. Temperature (skin, core), SkBF, skin conductivity, heart rate, thermal sensation, and thermal comfort were measured throughout. RESULTS: The capsaicin treatment did not differ from the control treatment in skin temperature (treatment mean: 30.0 ± 2.5, 30.1 ± 2.4 °C, respectively, p = 0.655), core temperature (treatment mean: 37.3 ± 0.5, 37.4 ± 0.4 °C, respectively, p = 0.113), SkBF (treatment mean: -8.4 ± 10.0, -11.1 ± 10.7 A.U., respectively, p = 0.492), skin conductivity (treatment mean: -0.7 ± 5.1, 0.4 ± 6.4 µS, respectively, p = 0.651), or heart rate (treatment mean: 83 ± 29, 85 ± 28 beats·minute-1, respectively, p = 0.234). The capsaicin and control treatments also did not differ in thermal sensation (p = 0.521) and thermal comfort (p = 0.982), with perceptual outcomes corresponding with feeling \"cool\" and \"just uncomfortable,\" respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 0.1% topical capsaicin application to exposed limbs prior to walking in a cold environment does not alter whole-body thermoregulation or thermal perception.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) is one of the most challenging diseases to treat with a significant negative impact on the patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Capsaicin 8% patch has arisen in the last decades as an alternative to oral drugs in the treatment of PNP with fewer side effects and promising results in efficacy. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the topical application of capsaicin in PNP and its impact on patients' HRQoL based on the use of capsaicin in a tertiary hospital of Oporto. METHODS: This study included 100 patients with localized PNP with poor pain control and without improvement with previous treatments that were treated at least once with an 8% capsaicin patch. Effectiveness on pain relief, number of treatments needed, safety and impact on HRQoL were assessed through a set of questionnaires. RESULTS: Regarding the aetiology of PNP, 67.6% (N = 46) have post-surgery or trauma induced PNP with 64.7% (N = 44) of patients reporting pain in the lower limb. After the treatment, 30.9% (N = 21) felt minimally improved, 22.1 (N = 15) felt much improved and 13.2 (N = 9) felt very much improved. On a scale from 1 to 10, in the week prior to the survey, the median intensity of pain was 6 and the median interference in quality of life was 7. The majority of patients still report limitations in mobility and daily activities and moderate pain. CONCLUSION: Capsaicin 8% patch is effective in PNP treatment at least in the short term. Repeated applications may be important for long-term analgesia. The low systemic dose and few side effects mean that the treatment is generally well tolerated by patients. Due to the analgesic effect, capsaicin can improve the HRQoL of patients with PNP."

However, its oral administration is hampered by its poor aqueous solubility and caustic effect at high administered doses. To address these limitations, we describe the development of gastric floating, sustained release electrospun films loaded with CAP. The nanofiber films were formulated using the polymers Eudragit RL/RS and sodium bicarbonate (SB) as the effervescent agent. The films were tested for their physicochemical properties, and film buoyancy and in vitro release of CAP were assessed in simulated gastric fluid. The cytocompatibility and anti-inflammatory properties of the films were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cells. The amorphous films showed improved wettability, a short floating lag time (<1 s) and a total floating time of over 24 h accompanied by sustained CAP release for up to 24 h. CAP-loaded films demonstrated biocompatibility with Caco-2 cells and potential cytoprotective effects by attenuating inflammatory cytokine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells. The gastric floating electrospun films could serve as a platform for sustained and stomach-specific drug delivery applications.",

To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of hydroxycitric acid and capsaicin (HCC) against male reproductive disorders, we developed an HFD-induced obese rat model. Rats received HFD supplementation for 21 weeks, which induced obesity. From week 16, HCC (100 mg/kg body weight) was administered to investigate its potential to treat testicular toxicity. According to the results of the current study, treatment of obese rats with HCC improved their sperm quality, increased the production of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone and significantly increased the activities of steroidogenic enzymes and corresponding mRNA levels. In addition, HCC decreased lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels in both spermatozoa and testes while increasing the expression of mRNA for the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in the testes, which in turn reduced oxidative stress in the testes. Moreover, after HCC treatment, testicular tissues showed a remarkable decrease in mRNA levels responsible for inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κB) and apoptosis (Bax and Bcl-2). Our results suggest that HCC may alleviate obesity-induced male reproductive dysfunction by attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the testes of HFD-induced obese male rats.",

DESIGN: Data were collected from electronic medical records of patients who received at least two HCCP treatments between January 2011 and July 2022. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the number of HCCP treatments, age groups, and specific neuropathic pain conditions. SETTING: The study was conducted at an outpatient pain center in Wiesbaden, Germany. SUBJECTS: The study included 97 patients, primarily diagnosed with neuropathic back pain, postoperative or post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and postherpetic neuralgia. METHODS: The daily dose of concomitant medications (eg, opioids and anticonvulsants) at the start of capsaicin therapy was compared with the average within 2 years of capsaicin therapy. The last observation carried forward method was used if HCCP treatment was discontinued before the end of the 2-year period. RESULTS: The majority of patients received concomitant medications, with opioids, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants being the most common. The average daily morphine equivalent dose decreased significantly during HCCP treatment. Pain intensity at baseline was generally high, but substantial improvements were observed in patients who received at least three HCCP applications. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of HCCP treatment in reducing pain intensity and concomitant opioid use in patients with neuropathic pain. Further research is needed to explore the long-term outcomes and optimal treatment regimens for different patient populations.",

Indeed, this compound exerts well-known systemic pleiotropic effects and may thus bring important benefits against various pathological conditions like neuropathic pain, rhinitis, itching, or chronic inflammation. Yet, little is known about the possible biological activity of capsaicin at the kidney level, as this aspect has only been addressed by sparse experimental investigations. In this paper, we aimed to review the available evidence focusing specifically on the effects of capsaicin on renal physiology, as well as its potential benefits for the treatment of various kidney disorders. Capsaicin may indeed modulate various aspects of renal function and renal nervous activity. On the other hand, the observed experimental benefits in preventing acute kidney injury, slowing down the progression of diabetic and chronic kidney disease, ameliorating hypertension, and even delaying renal cancer growth may set the stage for future human trials of capsaicin administration as an adjuvant or preventive therapy for different, difficult-to-treat renal diseases.",

      "abstract": "Capsaicin, which is abundant in chili peppers, exerts antioxidative, antitumor, antiulcer and analgesic effects and it has demonstrated potential as a treatment for cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, oncological and dermatological conditions. Unique among natural irritants, capsaicin initially excites neurons but then 'calms' them into long‑lasting non‑responsiveness. Capsaicin can also promote weight loss, making it potentially useful for treating obesity. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the therapeutic effects of capsaicin, including antioxidation, analgesia and promotion of apoptosis. Some of the mechanisms are proposed to be mediated by the capsaicin receptor (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1), but some are proposed to be independent of that receptor. The clinical usefulness of capsaicin is limited by its short half‑life. The present review provided an overview of what is known about the therapeutic effects of capsaicin and the mechanisms involved and certain studies arguing against its clinical use were mentioned.",

Studies on the effect of capsaicin (8-methyl-N-geranyl-6-nonamide, CAP) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in bronchial epithelial cells transformed with Ad12-SV40 2B (BEAS-2B) are still limited. This study aimed to investigate the effect and specific mechanism by which CAP improves LPS-induced ALI. METHODS: The present study investigated the effect of CAP and the potential underlying mechanisms in LPS-induced ALI in vitro and vivo via RNA sequencing, Western blotting (WB), quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT‒PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TRPV1 inhibitor AMG9810 and the AKT agonist SC79 were used to confirm the protective effect of the TRPV1/AKT axis against ALI. The autophagy agonist rapamycin (Rapa) and the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) were used to clarify the characteristics of LPS-induced autophagy. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that CAP effectively suppressed inflammation and autophagy in LPS-induced ALI, both in vivo and in vitro. This mechanism involves regulation by the TRPV1/AKT signaling pathway. By activating TRPV1, CAP reduces the expression of P-AKT, thereby exerting its anti-inflammatory and inhibitory effects on pro-death autophagy. Furthermore, prior administration of CAP provided substantial protection to mice against ALI induced by LPS, reduced the lung wet/dry ratio, decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression, and downregulated LC3 expression. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicate that CAP protects against LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting inflammatory responses and autophagic death through the TRPV1/AKT signaling pathway, presenting a novel strategy for ALI therapy."

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a novel form of nonapoptotic cell death, can effectively enhance photodynamic therapy (PDT) performance by disrupting intracellular redox homeostasis and promoting apoptosis. However, the extremely hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) together with highly expressed hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) presents a considerable challenge for clinical PDT against osteosarcoma (OS). Hence, an innovative nanoplatform that enhances antitumor PDT by inducing ferroptosis and alleviating hypoxia is fabricated. Capsaicin (CAP) is widely reported to specifically activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, trigger an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is closely linked with ferroptosis, and participate in decreased oxygen consumption by inhibiting HIF-1α in tumor cells, potentiating PDT antitumor efficiency. Thus, CAP and the photosensitizer IR780 are coencapsulated into highly biocompatible human serum albumin (HSA) to construct a nanoplatform (CI@HSA NPs) for synergistic tumor treatment under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. Furthermore, the potential underlying signaling pathways of the combination therapy are investigated. CI@HSA NPs achieve real-time dynamic distribution monitoring and exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy with superior biosafety in vivo. Overall, this work highlights a promising NIR imaging-guided \"pro-death\" strategy to overcome the limitations of PDT for OS by promoting ferroptosis and alleviating hypoxia, providing inspiration and support for future innovative tumor therapy approaches.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the potential beneficial role of Capsaicin in cognitive dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative damage induced by scopolamine in mice. BACKGROUND: Capsaicin is the chief phenolic component present in red chili and is responsible for its pungent and spicy flavor. It affects TRPV1 channels in nociceptive sensory neurons and is present in the hippocampus, and hypothalamus of the brains of rodents and humans. OBJECTIVE: The main objective is to investigate the effective role of capsaicin in attenuating cognitive dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative damage induced by scopolamine in mice and examine the feasible mechanisms. METHODS: Various doses of capsaicin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) were given orally to mice daily for 7 consecutive days after the administration of scopolamine. Various behavioral tests (motor coordination, locomotor counts, hole board test) and biochemical assay (Pro-inflammatory cytokines, catalase, lipid peroxidation, nitrite, reduced glutathione, and superoxide dismutase), mitochondrial complex (I, II, III, and IV) enzyme activities, and mitochondrial permeability transition were evaluated in the distinct regions of the brain. RESULTS: Scopolamine-treated mice showed a considerable reduction in the entries and duration in the light zone as well as in open arms of the elevated plus maze. Interestingly, capsaicin at different doses reversed the anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, and learning and memory impairment effects of scopolamine. Scopolamine-administered mice demonstrated substantially increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, impaired mitochondrial enzyme complex activities, and increased oxidative damage compared to the normal control group. Capsaicin treatment reinstated the reduced lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione activity, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and restoring mitochondrial complex enzyme activities (I, II, III, and IV) as well as mitochondrial permeability. Moreover, the IL-1β level was restored at a dose of capsaicin (10 and 20 mg/kg) only. Capsaicin reduced the scopolamine-induced acetylcholinesterase activity, thereby raising the acetylcholine concentration in the hippocampal tissues of mice. Preservation of neuronal cell morphology was also confirmed by capsaicin in histological studies. From the above experimental results, capsaicin at a dose of 10 mg/kg, p.o. for seven consecutive days was found to be the most effective dose. CONCLUSION: The experiential neuroprotective effect of capsaicin through the restoration of mitochondrial functions, antioxidant effects, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines makes it a promising candidate for further drug development through clinical setup.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In sepsis, the lungs are one of the most severely affected organs, usually resulting in acute lung injury (ALI). Capsaicin (CAP) is a natural compound found in chili peppers that has pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we report that nanoparticles containing capsaicin and iron (Fe-CAP NPs) exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of ALI. METHODS: The morphological characteristics of nanozymes were detected. RAW 264.7 cells were divided into four groups: control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CAP+LPS and Fe-CAP+LPS groups. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was assessed by immunofluorescence, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) expression was determined by Western blot. C57 mice were divided into control, LPS, CAP+LPS and Fe-CAP+LPS groups. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and iNOS expression in the lung was detected by Western Blot. IL-6 and TNF-α expression in serum was detected by ELISA. Extravasated Evans blue, histopathological evaluation and wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio were used to assess pulmonary capillary permeability. The blood and major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) of mice were tested for the toxicity of Fe-CAP NPs. RESULTS: In the LPS group, TNF-α, iNOS, p-NF-κB and p-IKBα expression increased. However, their expression was significantly decreased in the Fe-CAP+LPS group. TGF-β expression showed the opposite trend. In vivo, IL-6 and iNOS expression was notably increased in the lungs of LPS group of mice but decreased with Fe-CAP pretreatment. Fe-CAP significantly ameliorated lung EB leakage, improved the histopathology of lung tissue and reduced the W/D weight ratio. The nanoparticles showed non-cytotoxicity, when studying these biological activities. CONCLUSION: Fe-CAP NPs could alleviated inflammation by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in macrophages, increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory factors, and alleviating lung tissue damage.",

      "abstract": "Cancer profoundly influences morbidity and fatality rates worldwide. Patients often have dismal prognoses despite recent improvements in cancer therapy regimens. However, potent biomolecules derived from natural sources, including medicinal and dietary plants, contain biological and pharmacological properties to prevent and treat various human malignancies. Capsaicin is a bioactive phytocompound present in red hot chili peppers. Capsaicin has demonstrated many biological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticarcinogenic capabilities. This review highlights the cellular and molecular pathways through which capsaicin exhibits antineoplastic activities. Our work also depicts the synergistic anticancer properties of capsaicin in conjunction with other natural bioactive components and approved anticancer drugs. Capsaicin inhibits proliferation in various cancerous cells, and its antineoplastic actions in numerous in vitro and in vivo carcinoma models impact oncogenesis, tumor-promoting and suppressor genes, and associated signaling pathways. Capsaicin alone or combined with other phytocompounds or approved antineoplastic drugs triggers cell cycle progression arrest, generating reactive oxygen species and disrupting mitochondrial membrane integrity, ultimately stimulating caspases and promoting death. Furthermore, capsaicin alone or in combination can promote apoptosis in carcinoma cells by enhancing the p53 and c-Myc gene expressions. In conclusion, capsaicin alone or in combination can have enormous potential for cancer prevention and intervention, but further high-quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of this phytocompound.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disease is mainly characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, contributing to mitochondrial impairments, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and neuroinflammation resulting in synaptic loss and neuronal loss. These pathophysiological factors are a serious concern in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Based on the symptoms of various neurodegenerative diseases, different treatments are available, but they have serious side effects and fail in clinical trials, too. Therefore, treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are still a challenge at present. Thus, it is important to study an alternative option. Capsaicin is a naturally occurring alkaloid found in capsicum. Besides the TRPV1 receptor activator in nociception, capsaicin showed a protective effect in brain-related disorders. Capsaicin also reduces the aggregation of misfolded proteins, improves mitochondrial function, and decreases ROS generation. Its antioxidant role is due to increased expression of an nrf2-mediated signaling pathway. Nrf2 is a nuclear erythroid 2-related factor, a transcription factor, which has a crucial role in maintaining the normal function of mitochondria and the cellular defense system against oxidative stress. Intriguingly, Nrf2 mediated pathway improved the upregulation of antioxidant genes and inhibition of microglial-induced inflammation, improved mitochondrial resilience and functions, leading to decreased ROS in neurodegenerative conditions, suggesting that Nrf2 activation could be a better therapeutic approach to target pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, the present review has evaluated the potential role of capsaicin as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of various neurodegenerative diseases via the Nrf2-mediated signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor worldwide. Capsaicin and cold exposure were positively correlated with CRC metastasis. However, the mechanisms of action underlying capsaicin and cold exposure in 1,2-dimethylhyrazine (DMH)-induced CRC remain unknown. Multiple assays were utilized in the present study, including methylene blue, hematoxylin eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, western blotting and Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA), in order to assess the influence of capsaicin and cold exposure on CRC rat models induced by DMH. The present study reported that capsaicin and cold exposure treatment significantly increased the size and number of colonic tumors, and the CRC metastasis rate in the capsaicin and cold exposure groups was higher than that in DMH model group.Moreover, it was observed that capsaicin and cold exposure increased mRNA and protein expression levels of LAMC2 and integrin-β1 induced by DMH. Duolink PLA results indicated that cold exposure and capsaicin significantly promoted interaction formation between LAMC2 and ITGB1 in CRC rats induced by DMH. Furthermore, western blot and IHC analysis confirmed that cold exposure and capsaicin inhibited DMH-induced decreases in the expression levels of E-cadherin, and increases in the expression levels of p-FAK, Snails, Fibronectin and N-cadherin. In addition, the serum levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in capsaicin and cold exposure group were higher than those of model group. In conclusion, our study suggests that both capsaicin and cold exposure may contribute to EMT-mediated the formation of premetastatic niche, which may lead to CRC metastasis by activating the early interaction between LAMC2 and integrin-β1."

      "abstract": "Individuals with acquired brain injuries (ABIs) may experience various complications related to poor coughing or impaired cough reflex (including risk of aspiration pneumonia or respiratory infections). For this reason, cough assessment is an important component in the clinical evaluation since patients with ABI are not able to cough voluntarily due to severe motor deficits. When voluntarily coughing is not possible, it is essential for clinical practices to find a quick and minimally invasive way to induce a cough reflex. In the present study, we evaluated the cough reflex in ABI patients using a new method based on a capsaicin spray stimulation test. In total, 150 healthy controls demographically matched with 50 ABI patients were included in this study. Clinical observations demonstrated robust cough response in both healthy controls and ABI patients, as well as the safety and tolerability of capsaicin spray stimulation. ABI patients with dysphagia were characterized by slower and delayed cough responses. Further studies are needed to validate this feasible, less-invasive, and simple-to-comprehend technique in inducing cough reflex. According to this preliminary evidence, we believe that this test might be translated into a simple and effective treatment to improve reflexive cough modulation in ABI patients."

The biological assays indicated that most of these compounds demonstrated strong inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities with IC50 values in the nanomolar, as well as good blood-brain barrier permeability. Among the synthesized hybrids, compound 5s displayed the most balanced inhibitory effect on hAChE (IC50 = 69.8 nM) and hBuChE (IC50 = 68.0 nM), and exhibited promising inhibitory activity against β-secretase-1 (BACE-1) (IC50 = 3.6 µM). Combining inhibition kinetics and molecular model analysis, compound 5s was shown to be a mixed inhibitor affecting both the catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of hAChE. Additionally, compound 5s showed low toxicity in PC12 and BV2 cell assays. Moreover, compound 5s demonstrated good tolerance at the dose of up to 2500 mg/kg and exhibited no hepatotoxicity at the dose of 3 mg/kg in mice, and it could effectively improve memory ability in mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that compound 5s is a promising and effective multi-target agent for the potential treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "Dietary-derived substances possess significant potential as anthropogenic markers owing to the large consumption and different intake habit. To investigate and evaluate such markers, wastewater samples from 35 wastewater treatment plants across 29 Chinese cities were collected to analyze artificial sweeteners (acesulfame and cyclamate) and natural spicy compounds (capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin). Acesulfame (mean: 14.6 μg/L), cyclamate (mean: 24.3 μg/L), and capsaicin (mean: 101 ng/L) can be further investigated as anthropogenic markers due to their high detection frequency at high concentrations. Spatial use patterns revealed that acesulfame (5.31 g/d/1000 inhabitants (inh)) and cyclamate (8.16 g/d/1000 inh) use in northern China notably surpassed that in southern China (1.79 g/d/1000 inh and 3.23 g/d/1000 inh, p < 0.05). Conversely, chili pepper use was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in southern China (6702 g/d/1000 inh) than in northern China (2751 g/d/1000 inh), signifying a preference for sweetness in the northern regions and a predilection for spiciness in the southern regions. The total annual use of acesulfame (1842 t), cyclamate (3110 t), and chili (18.4 million tonnes) in China was estimated by this study, which was close to the national statistical production. In addition, sweetener use was negatively associated with the elderly population ratio, suggesting that the elderly population might not consume sweet foods. This study reveals the dietary sources of anthropogenic markers, highlighting the need for further research on the environmental implications of such markers.",

Among analgesics that act on pain receptors, he identified capsaicin as a selective lead molecule. He studied the application of capsaicin and revealed several physiological (pain, thermoregulation) and pathophysiological (inflammation, gastric ulcer) mechanisms. He discovered a new neuroregulatory system without sensory efferent reflex and investigated its pharmacology. The authors of this review are his former Ph.D. students who carried out their doctoral work in Szolcsányi's laboratory between 1985 and 2010 and report on the scientific results obtained under his guidance. His research group provided evidence for the triple function of the peptidergic capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons including classical afferent function, local efferent responses, and remote, hormone-like anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive actions. They also proposed somatostatin receptor type 4 as a promising drug target for the treatment of pain and inflammation. They revealed that neonatal capsaicin treatment caused no acute neuronal death but instead long-lasting selective ultrastructural and functional changes in B-type sensory neurons, similar to adult treatment. They described that lipid raft disruption diminished the agonist-induced channel opening of the TRPV1, TRPA1, and TRPM8 receptors in native sensory neurons. Szolcsányi's group has developed new devices for noxious heat threshold measurement: an increasing temperature hot plate and water bath. This novel approach proved suitable for assessing the thermal antinociceptive effects of analgesics as well as for analyzing peripheral mechanisms of thermonociception."

METHODS: Firstly, twenty-four pieces of zirconia with a size of 10 mm×10 mm×2 mm and 20 pieces of zirconia with a size of 3 mm×3 mm×2 mm were prepared. Then pieces were divided into four groups, and dealt with separately according to the following groups: no treatment (group A), sandblasting (group B), hot etching with HCl(group C), hot etching with HF(group D). Finally, the surface topography and bond strength were tested by atomic force microscopy(AFM), scanning electron microscope(SEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD) and universal testing machine, etc. Statistical analysis of the experimental data was performed with SPSS 26.0 software package. The final results of XRD were analyzed using MDI Jade 6 combined with Origin 2019 software. RESULTS: Groups C and D produced completely different topographical changes on the surface of zirconia than group B. Obvious interfacial cracks were observed in group B. Group D achieved the highest roughness value (78.17±4.94) nm and highest shear bond strength (25.09±4.09) MPa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with HCl, hot etching with HF could achieve more uniform and dense porous morphology, greater roughness and shear bond strength. There were no obvious cross-section interfacial cracks and crystal phase transformations on the surface of zirconia.",

      "abstract": "The increased mortality rates associated with colorectal cancer highlight the pressing need for improving treatment approaches. While capsaicin (CAP) has shown promising anticancer activity, its efficacy is hampered due to low solubility, rapid metabolism, suboptimal bioavailability, and a short half-life. Therefore, this study aimed to prepare a lactoferrin-functionalized carboxymethyl dextran-coated egg albumin nanoconjugate (LF-CMD@CAP-EGA-NCs) for the targeted CAP delivery to enhance its potential for colorectal cancer therapy. Briefly, LF-CMD was synthesized through an esterification reaction involving LF as a receptor and CMD as a shell. Concurrently, CAP was incorporated into an EGA carrier using gelation and hydrophobic interactions. The subsequent production of LF-CMD@CAP-EGA-NCs was achieved through the Maillard reaction. Spectral characterizations confirmed the successful synthesis of smooth and spherical-shaped LF-CMD@CAP-EGA-NCs using LF-CMD and EGA-CAP nanoparticles, with high entrapment efficiency and satisfactory drug content. Furthermore, LF-CMD@CAP-EGA-NCs demonstrated a sustained release of CAP (76.52 ± 1.01 % in 24 h, R2 = 0.9966) in pH 5.8 buffer with anomalous transport (n = 0.68) owing to the shell of the CMD and EGA matrix. The nanoconjugate exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity in HCT116 and LoVo cell lines, which is attributed to the overexpression of LF receptors in colorectal HCT116 cells. Additionally, LF-CMD@CAP-EGA-NCs demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, as observed in the FHC-CRL-1831 cell line. In conclusion, LF-CMD@CAP-EGA-NCs can be considered as a promising approach for targeted delivery of CAP and other anticancer agents in colorectal cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Terpenes in Cannabis sativa exert analgesic effects, but the mechanisms are uncertain. We examined the effects of 10 terpenes on capsaicin responses in an established model of neuronal hypersensitivity. Adult rat DRG neurons cultured with neurotrophic factors NGF and GDNF were loaded with Fura2AM for calcium imaging, and treated with individual terpenes or vehicle for 5 min, followed by 1 µMol capsaicin. In vehicle treated control experiments, capsaicin elicited immediate and sustained calcium influx. Most neurons treated with terpenes responded to capsaicin after 6-8 min. Few neurons showed immediate capsaicin responses that were transient or normal. The delayed responses were found to be due to calcium released from the endoplasmic reticulum, as they were maintained in calcium/magnesium free media, but not after thapsigargin pre-treatment. Terpene inhibition of calcium influx was reversed after washout of medium, in the absence of terpenes, and in the presence of the Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain, but not CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists. Thus, terpenes inhibit capsaicin evoked calcium influx by Na+/K+ ATPase activation. Immunofluorescence showed TRPV1 co-expression with α1β1 Na+/K+ ATPase in most neurons while others were either TRPV1 or α1β1 Na+/K+ ATPase positive.",

      "abstract": "Early life stress (ELS) is associated with the later development of schizophrenia. In the rodent model, the maternal separation (MS) stress may induce neuronal apoptosis and schizophrenia-like behavior. Although the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (CAP) has been reported to reduce apoptosis in the central nervous system, its effect in MS models is unclear. Twenty-four hours of MS of Wistar rat pups on postnatal day (PND9) was used as an ELS. Male rats in the adult stage were the subjects of the study. CAP (1 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneal injection pretreatment was undertaken before behavioral tests for 1 week and continued during the tests. Behavioral tests included open field, novel object recognition, Barnes maze test, and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) test. MS rats showed behavioral deficits and cognitive impairments mimicking symptoms of schizophrenia compared with controls. MS decreased the expression of TRPV1 in the frontal association cortex (FrA) and in the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) regions compared with the control group resulting in the increase of pro-apoptotic proteins (BAX, Caspase3, Cleaved-Caspase3) and the decrease of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). The number of NeuN++TUNEL+ cells increased in the MS group in the FrA, CA1, CA3, and DG compared with the control group. Neuronal and behavioral impairments of MS were reversed by treatment with CAP. Exposure to ELS may lead to increased neuronal apoptosis and impaired cognitive function with decreased TRPV1 expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in adulthood. Sustained low-dose administration of CAP improved neuronal apoptosis and cognitive function. Our results provide evidence for future clinical trials of chili peppers or CAP as dietary supplements for the reversal treatment of schizophrenia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Capsaicin (CAP), a frequently occurring alkaloid component found in spicy peppers, has demonstrated therapeutic potential against tumors, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular disorders. Doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used anthracycline drug in chemotherapy, is notorious for its cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate the potential of CAP in mitigating DOX toxicity in mouse hearts and H9C2 cells, as well as to explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: In our study, we conducted experiments on both mice and H9C2 cells. The mice were divided into four groups and treated with different substances: normal saline, CAP, DOX and CAP+DOX. We evaluated the induction of ferroptosis by DOX and the remission of ferroptosis by CAP using various methods, including echocardiography, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, and determination of ferroptosis metabolites, genes and proteins. Additionally, we employed RNA-seq to identify the inhibitory effect of CAP on DOX-induced myocardial apoptosis, which was further confirmed through western blotting. Similar approaches were applied to H9C2 cells, yielding reliable results. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that treatment with CAP improved the survival rate of DOX-treated mice and reduced myocardial injury. Mechanistically, CAP downregulated transferrin (Trf) and upregulated solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A1), which helped maintain iron levels in the cells and prevent ferroptosis. Furthermore, CAP inhibited DOX-induced apoptosis by modulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)- protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. Specifically, CAP activated the PI3K-Akt pathway and regulated downstream BCL2 and BAX to mitigate DOX-induced apoptosis. Therefore, our results suggest that CAP effectively alleviates acute myocardial injury induced by DOX. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that CAP has the potential to alleviate DOX-induced ferroptosis by regulating iron homeostasis. Additionally, it can inhibit DOX-induced apoptosis by activating PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.",
