      "abstract": "Overeating highly palatable foods typical of a Western diet (WD) has been linked to cognitive impairments in animal models and humans. Exercise training was proposed as an important behavioral intervention with beneficial effects, including improving peripheral insulin sensitivity, improving central functions such as learning and memory, and restoring a dysregulated blood-brain barrier (BBB). The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effect of exercise training in rats fed with the WD with special emphasis on BBB. Adult female Long Evans rats were subjected to 12 weeks of WD feeding (WD group), or simultaneous WD feeding and wheel-running training (WD/EX group), or were fed a WD for 6 weeks without training and then subjected to diet and training for an additional 6 weeks (WD_WD/EX group). A sedentary (untrained) group of lean rats was fed a standard rodent chow (CTR group). In all experimental groups, we measured behavioral and physiological parameters, and the hippocampal levels of proteins structurally and functionally related to BBB, including proinflammatory cytokines and products of elevated lipid peroxidation. Exercise training in combination with a WD decreased locomotor and exploratory activities and induced short-term memory impairments. The behavioral changes were accompanied by reduced levels of occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 proteins in the hippocampus, suggesting changes in the integrity and increased permeability of BBB. In the WD_WD/EX rats, we found increased hippocampal levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and neurotrophins (Bdnf, Vegfa) suggesting that increased energy expenditure by obese rats stimulates endogenous protective processes. The training introduced after 6 weeks of WD feeding in rats showing an obese phenotype may suggest that the sequence and moment of presumably protective intervention (exercise training) could alleviate or, on the contrary, exacerbate the level of stress and its consequences."

      "abstract": "There is currently increased interest in nanocellulose as a food emulsifier and dietary supplement. It was hypothesized that nanocellulose could modulate behaviors and glucose homeostasis in female mice using mechanisms of altered gut microbiome and immune modulation. An initial experiment was conducted with the objective of examining whether three common types of nanocellulose affected the gut microbiome of female C57BL/6 mice on a Western diet. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), TEMPO-CNF and cellulose nanocrystals were administered at the physiologically relevant dose of 30 mg/kg/day for 30 days by gavage, with cellulose and water groups as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Findings suggested that CNF had the strongest effect on the gut microbiome. CNF was therefore selected for a chronic 6-month study on the gut microbiome, immune system and behaviors in female NOD mice, a model for type 1 diabetes. Gut microbiome analysis suggested that there might be some beneficial changes following subchronic exposure (e.g., at the two-month timepoint), however, this effect was no longer seen after chronic consumption (e.g., at the six-month timepoint). CNF treatment also altered the immune homeostasis, including decreases in the splenic Mac-3+ population and serum level of proinflammatory chemokine LIX. Additionally, CNF consumption decreased diabetic incidences but had no effect on the depressive-like behavior and grip strength. However, further analysis, e.g., the insulin tolerance test, indicated that CNF-treated NOD mice might exhibit signs of insulin resistance. Taken together, nanocellulose dysregulated glucose homeostasis in female mice on a Western diet involving mechanisms related to alteration of the gut microbiome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease - mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a syndrome that begins early in CKD, contributes to CKD-associated mortality, and includes components of FGF23 elevation, αklotho deficiency, CKD-stimulated vascular disease, and renal osteodystrophy. Hyperphosphatemia, occurring in later stages of CKD, is also driven by mechanisms of CKD-MBD, and has been shown to stimulate vascular calcification. In a mouse model of Alport CKD that is resistant to vascular calcification, we examine the effects of a high-phosphate Western-type diet on the CKD-MBD, and test whether the diet promotes induction of vascular calcification. METHODS: An X-linked Col4a5 deficient murine homolog of Alport Syndrome (CKD) and wild type (WT) littermates were fed an animal protein 1.2% high phosphate diet or a standard vegetable protein diet. At disease progression equivalent to CKD stage 4-5, we examined kidney histology for fibrosis, blood for BUN (marker of CKD), and markers of CKD-MBD disease progression, kidney tissue for klotho production, and aorta histology and tissue mRNA and protein analysis for vascular calcification. RESULTS: The Western high Pi diet produced hyperphosphatemia in the CKD animals compared to WT and increased plasma PTH (1880 from 110 pg / ml), FGF23 c-term (670 from 120 pg / ml), and FGF23 intact (3780 from 280 pg / ml), and reduced kidney klotho mRNA and protein (57-67% reduction) (all p < 0.01). Referenced against the CKD animals fed vegetable-based diet, the Western high phosphate-fed CKD animals showed higher levels of plasma PTH and FGF23s. In the wild-type control mice with normal renal function, Western diet produced increased PTH, intact FGF23, and reduced renal klotho (all p <0.01). Vascular smooth muscle transdifferentiation and vascular calcification was not induced by Western high phosphate diet in this model of CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a Western-style high-phosphate diet advances elements of the CKD-MBD. Renal klotho, FGF23 and PTH are affected by diet even with normal kidney function, suggesting a need for early intervention in the management of phosphate homeostasis as a component of CKD therapy. Additionally, CKD, klotho, and FGF23 all are associated with early aging. Therefore, our findings suggest that a Western high Pi diet accelerates aging and would contribute to the systemic complications of CKD - cardiac disease, osteodystrophy, and vascular disease."

      "abstract": "Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has emerged as a leading chronic liver disease. This condition is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fat within liver and can progress from simple steatosis to more severe stages involving chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism of novel bioactive peptides (EWYF and EWFY) on Western diet-induced MAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. Mice fed a normal chow diet (ND group) and Western diet (WD and treatment groups) for 8 weeks. Treatment groups received EWYF and EWFY peptides in low (10 mg/kg/day) and high (50 mg/kg/day) doses were divided into four groups: EWYF10, EWYF50, EWFY10, and EWFY50. Western diet-induced body weight gain and increased liver weight along with visceral adiposity, which were markedly reversed by bioactive peptides in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, bioactive peptides significantly reduced hepatic steatosis, liver injury and proinflammatory response. Western diet-induced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, whereas bioactive peptides significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Persistent intake of Western diet triggered chronic inflammation and severe oxidative stress, which were significantly alleviated by bioactive peptides treatment via inhibiting NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and mitigated pyroptosis by modulating TLR4/NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. Furthermore, molecular docking studies suggest that EWYF and EWFY act as fructokinase antagonists and TLR4 inhibitors, which potentially alleviates Western diet-induced MAFLD. Collectively, these findings highlight EWYF and EWFY as promising candidates for MAFLD treatment due to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties via specific molecular inhibition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Approved drugs for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) are limited, although it has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) possesses various biological effects such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. However, the effects and underlying mechanism of PMP in MASH remain unclear. METHODS: Steatosis cells were induced by palmitate/oleic acid (PO). Then, the contents of lipids and reactive oxygen species were measured. To further investigate the effects of PMP on MASH models, C57BL/6J mice were fed a western diet (WD) for 24 weeks and PMP was administered daily by intragastric gavage. Serum enzymes and lipids were assayed by a biochemistry analyzer. RNA sequencing, real-time qPCR, and western blotting were used to measure the expression of different genes. Histological analysis of the liver included HE, Oil red O, and Sirius red staining. RESULTS: PMP alleviated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress induced by PO (P < 0.001). In vivo, WD-induced significant elevation of blood glucose and serum lipids were reduced by PMP (P < 0.05). Furthermore, PMP effectively prevented hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in MASH mice. Western blot results suggested PMP promoted the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPKα at T172, which is a marker of activation of the AMPK pathway. RNA sequencing also demonstrated that PMP facilitated the activation of the AMPK pathway. Furthermore, the protective effects of PMP on steatosis cells and MASH mice disappeared after treatment with an AMPK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: PMP protects against metabolic-stress-induced MASH through activating AMPK signaling, indicating that PMP may be a candidate for MASH therapy in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Celastrol was recently identified as a potential treatment for obesity and hepatic steatosis. However, whether Celastrol effectively suppresses the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) stage remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Celastrol in the progression from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a Western diet combined with a weekly low-dose injection of CCl4 (WD/CCl4) for 16 weeks to establish NASH models. The effects of Celastrol on NASH were further explored through histopathological assessments, immunoblotting, and in vitro analyses. RESULTS: Celastrol treatment effectively attenuated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in WD/CCl4-induced NASH models, in which Notch2 was downregulated by Celastrol in a posttranscriptional manner. In vitro experiments revealed that Notch2 suppression in Celastrol-treated hepatocytes further decreased osteopontin (OPN) levels, inhibiting hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. Moreover, the protective effects of Celastrol on NASH progression were abolished in Notch2-overexpressing mice. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the protective effects of Celastrol on NASH-related liver fibrosis by modulating Notch/OPN signaling, providing fresh insights into the potential application of Celastrol in NASH treatment.",

We measured transepithelial short circuit current (Isc), across freshly isolated segments of jejunum from male C57Bl/6J mice randomly assigned to one of the following groups for the study duration: high-fat high-sugar diet for 24 wk (HFHS), HFHS diet for 12 wk then switched to standard chow and water for a further 12 wk (Std), and lean controls (standard chow and water for 24 wk). At the completion of the study, segments of jejunum were frozen for Western blot determination of key proteins involved in secretory and absorptive functions, as well as senescence. Intestinal morphology was assessed. Serum and tissue assays were performed. Basal Isc was significantly decreased (by 42%, P < 0.05) in HFHS versus leans. This decrease in Isc was fully reversed by switching to Std diet. The HFHS-induced decrease in Isc was attributed to a significant loss of calcium-activated chloride channel (ClC2) expression. Changes in inflammatory state (TNF-α) and intestinal health [myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity] were associated with body weight changes.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Black adults have a higher risk for heart failure (HF) than others, which may be related to higher cardiovascular risk factors and also inflammatory dietary patterns. The Western diet is associated with inflammation and contributes to HF. Trimethylamine N-oxide is a diet-linked metabolite that contributes to inflammation and is associated with higher tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels, especially in HF populations. The dietary inflammatory index score measures a diet's inflammatory potential and food's inflammatory effects. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to explore associations between the Western diet, dietary inflammatory index, trimethylamine N-oxide, relevant covariates and variables, and TNF-α in Black persons with HF. METHODS: Thirty-one Black participants (mean age = 55 years, 68% women) with HF were enrolled. Trimethylamine N-oxide and TNF-α levels were analyzed using immunoassays. A food frequency questionnaire was completed, and dietary inflammatory index scores and food groups were calculated. Analyses included correlations and I-test statistics. RESULTS: Mean dietary inflammatory index score was -0.38, noting an anti-inflammatory diet with slightly higher inflammatory diet scores in men compared to women. The dietary inflammatory index score showed a negative association with dietary choline but not with trimethylamine N-oxide or TNF-α. Trimethylamine N-oxide and age were positively correlated, along with the correlation for TNF-α with a moderate effect size. No relationship was found among dietary inflammatory index, TNF-α, and trimethylamine N-oxide variables. DISCUSSION: A greater understanding of intake of inflammatory foods and relationships with immune factors is warranted to inform intervention development. In Black adults with HF, it is important to consider the intake of inflammatory foods as increased age may affect the retention of dietary metabolites. Metabolites may also increase the levels of inflammation. Knowledge about these relationships could lead to tailored dietary interventions based on diet, age, and culture patterns.",

Thus, interventions targeting the microbiome may prove helpful in preventing or reversing this impairment. We previously reported that spore-forming Bacillus subtilis DE111 improved endothelial function in a cohort of healthy, non-obese humans after a four-week intervention. Building on these promising results, the present study sought to investigate whether administering B. subtilis DE111 could reverse endothelial dysfunction in mice with diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a Western diet (WD; n = 24) or standard diet (SD; n = 24) for ten weeks to induce endothelial dysfunction, after which half of the animals in each group (n = 12) were allocated to receive B. subtilis DE111 (hereafter, PB) formulated into the diet for an additional eight weeks. Outcomes included endothelial-dependent arterial dilation, glucose tolerance, body weight changes, microbiota profiles, and assessments of intestinal permeability and mucosal immunity markers. Furthermore, a cell culture model of gut barrier function was used to assess the effects of PB on gut barrier integrity. PB treatment significantly attenuated WD-induced mesenteric endothelial-dependent arterial dilation, independent of changes in other cardiometabolic parameters or changes in gut barrier function. In vitro trans-epithelial electrical resistance of the Caco-2 cell culture confirmed that neither PB-conditioned media nor faecal waters from B. subtilis-treated human stool resulted in gut barrier improvements, nor did they protect against inflammation-associated barrier disruptions. Unsurprisingly, microbiota analysis revealed significant differences in Shannon's alpha diversity of WD-fed animals compared to SD. These data suggest that PB consumption significantly attenuated WD diet-induced endothelial dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanisms of this protection were not determined. Improvement in endothelial function was independent of PB-mediated changes to body weight or gut barrier function. Further studies should explore B. subtilis-mediated immune responses or metabolite production as mechanisms underlying these endothelial protective effects."

Male and/or female intestinal epithelial-specific Hif1α overexpression mice (Hif1αLSL/LSL;VilERcre) and wild-type littermates (Hif1αLSL/LSL) were fed with regular chow diet, high fructose (HFr) or high-fat (60% Kcal) high-fructose diet (HFHFr) for 8 weeks. Metabolic phenotypes were profiled. RESULTS: Dimethyloxalylglycine treatment led to increased intestine HIF-α luciferase activity and decreased blood glucose levels in HFr diet-fed male ODD-luc mice. Male Hif1αLSL/LSL;VilERcre mice exhibited markedly improved glucose tolerance compared to Hif1αLSL/LSL mice in response to HFr diet. Eight weeks HFHFr feeding led to obesity in both Hif1αLSL/LSL;VilERcre and Hif1αLSL/LSL mice. However, male Hif1αLSL/LSL;VilERcre mice exhibited markedly attenuated hepatic steatosis along with reduced liver size and liver weight compared to male Hif1αLSL/LSL mice. Moreover, HFHFr-induced systemic inflammatory responses were mitigated in male Hif1αLSL/LSL;VilERcre mice compared to male Hif1αLSL/LSL mice, and those responses were not evident in female mice. Ileum RNA-seq analysis revealed that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis was up in male Hif1αLSL/LSL;VilERcre mice, accompanied by increased epithelial cell proliferation. Moreover, an in vitro study showed that HIF stabilization enhances glycolysis in intestine organoids. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that pharmacological or genetic activation of intestinal HIF-1α markedly ameliorates western diet-induced metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in a sex-dependent manner. The underlying mechanism is likely attributed to HIF-1α activation-induced upregulation of glycolysis, which, in turn, leads to enhanced epithelial cell proliferation and augmented gut barrier function.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We established S100A9 as a myeloid-derived damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) protein associated with increasing severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in type 2 diabetic subjects. The present study investigates the retinal localization, expression, and mechanisms of action for S100A9 in the young obese Ossabaw pig retina. METHODS: Retinae from Ossabaw pigs fed a Western diet for 10 weeks were evaluated for S100 and inflammatory mediator expression using quantitative PCR and Western blot. Double immunohistochemistry was performed to identify the cellular sources of S100A9 in the pig retina. Primary pig retinal microglial cells (pMicroglia) were examined for S100A9 production. S100A9-induced responses were also investigated, and inhibitor studies elucidated the mechanism of action via the NLRP3 inflammasome. A specific inhibitor, Paquinimod (ABR-215757), was administered in vitro to assess the rescue of S100A9-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in pMicroglia. RESULTS: The expression of the S100 family in the obese Ossabaw pig retina showed a significant elevation of S100A9, consistent with increased levels of circulating S100A9. Moreover, the retina had elevated levels of inflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, IL-1β and NLRP3. Retinal microglia in obese Ossabaw were activated and accompanied by an increased expression of intracellular S100A9. pMicroglia isolated from pig retina transformed from ramified to amoeboid state when activated with LPS and produced high S100A9 transcript and protein levels. The S100A9 protein, in turn, further activated pMicroglia by heightened production of S100A9 transcripts and secretion of pro-inflammatory IL-1β protein. Inhibition of TLR4 with TAK242 and NLRP3 with MCC950 attenuated the production of IL-1β during S100A9 stimulus. Finally, pre-treatment with Paquinimod successfully reduced S100A9-driven increases of glycosylated-TLR4, NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and IL-1β production. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that microglial-derived S100A9 perpetuates pro-inflammatory responses via the NLRP3 inflammasome in the retina of young Western-diet-fed Ossabaw pigs exhibiting diabetic retinopathy."

We studied the combined effect of a Western-type diet (WD) and diclofenac, a standard NSAID used in surgical patients, on anastomotic healing and gut microbiota composition following distal colon resection. METHODS: Forty-two rats were fed a WD for 6 weeks, after which they were randomized to either parenteral diclofenac 3 mg/kg/day or saline started on the day of surgery and continued for three days. The surgical procedure involved distal colon resection with anastomosis. Animals were sacrificed on postoperative day (POD)-3 or POD-5. Anastomotic healing was assessed and correlated with diclofenac treatment and gut microbiota composition, analyzed by 16S rRNA marker gene amplicon sequencing. Mucosal integrity of the anastomosis was evaluated by histological analysis. RESULTS: Anastomotic leakage rate was 100 percent (8/8) in diclofenac-treated rats and 10 percent (1/10) in saline-treated controls on POD-5. Diclofenac administration in WD-fed animals induced a shift in microbiota composition, characterized by an increase in microbiota diversity on POD-5 and a significant 15-fold, 4-fold, and 16-fold increase of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia, respectively. Diclofenac use in WD-fed animals caused mucosal erosion on POD-5, a phenomenon not observed in control animals. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of a Western diet combined with diclofenac administration shifts the microbiota composition, associated with clinically relevant AL in the distal colon of rats."

Acarbose is an anti-diabetic drug that not only improves glucose homeostasis, but also extends the lifespan of wild-type mice.

Both male and female WD-fed 3xTg mice have worsened cognitive deficits than Control-fed mice, and these deficits are ameliorated by acarbose treatment. Molecular and histological analysis of tau and amyloid pathology identified sex-specific effects of acarbose which are uncoupled from the dramatic improvements in cognition in females, suggesting that the benefits of acarbose on AD may be largely driven by improved metabolic health.

Pyridoxamine (PM), a vitamin B6 analog, has been shown to exert protective effects in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether PM limits adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in rats who develop T2DM. Male rats received a standard chow diet or Western diet (WD) for 18 weeks to induce prediabetes. One WD group received additional PM (1 g/L) via drinking water. Glucose tolerance was assessed with a 1 h oral glucose tolerance test. Cardiac function was evaluated using echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements. Histology on left ventricular (LV) tissue was performed. Treatment with PM prevented the increase in fasting plasma glucose levels compared to WD-fed rats (p < 0.05). LV cardiac dilation tended to be prevented using PM supplementation. In LV tissue, PM limited an increase in interstitial collagen deposition (p < 0.05) seen in WD-fed rats. PM tended to decrease 3-nitrotyrosine and significantly lowered 4-hydroxynonenal content compared to WD-fed rats. We conclude that PM alleviates interstitial fibrosis and oxidative stress in the hearts of WD-induced prediabetic rats.",

As platelets drive clot formation, the terminus of cardiovascular events, we aimed to elucidate the longitudinal effect of an obesogenic diet on platelet phenotype by assessing markers of platelet activation using flow cytometry. Male, weanling mice were fed either a Western diet (30% kcal sucrose, 40% kcal fat, 8.0% sodium) or Control diet (7% kcal sucrose, 10% kcal fat, 0.24% sodium). At 12, 16 and 20 weeks on diets, platelets were collected and stained to visualize glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα), P-selectin and the conformationally active state of αIIbβ3 (a platelet specific integrin) after collagen stimulation. At all time points, a Western diet reduced GPIbα and αIIbβ3 expression in platelets broadly while P-selectin levels were unaffected. However, P-selectin was diminished by a Western diet in the GPIbα- subpopulation. Thus, a Western diet persistently primed platelets towards a blunted activation response as indicated by reduced active αIIbβ3 and P-selectin surface expression. This study provides a first look at the influence of diet on platelet activation and revealed that platelet activation is susceptible to dietary intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of a Western diet on obesity and diabetes among reproductive-aged women pose a significant threat to the cardiovascular health of their offspring. Given the crucial role of glutathione metabolism and glutathione-related antioxidant defense systems in cardiovascular diseases through scavenging ROS and maintaining redox homeostasis, further exploration of their specific influence is imperative to develop therapeutic strategies for cardiomyopathy induced by a maternal Western diet. METHODS: We developed a prenatal maternal Western diet exposure model in C57/B6 mice to investigate cardiac morphology and function through histological analysis and echocardiography. RNA sequencing and analysis were utilized to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the impact of a maternal Western diet and N-acetylcysteine treatment on cardiomyopathy. Additionally, ELISAs, transmission electron microscopy, and flow cytometry were employed to assess the antioxidant defense system and mitochondrial ROS levels in progenitor cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: N-acetylcysteine significantly mitigated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, collagen type I accumulation, and left ventricular remodeling induced by a maternal Western diet, particularly in male offspring. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine reversed the increase in apoptosis and the increase in the β/α-MyHC ratio in the myocardium of offspring that results from a maternal Western diet. RNA sequencing and GSEA revealed that the beneficial effects of N-acetylcysteine were linked to its ability to modulate oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Additionally, N-acetylcysteine treatment during pregnancy can markedly elevate glutathione levels, augment glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and mitigate the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS caused by a maternal Western diet. CONCLUSIONS: N-acetylcysteine mitigated cardiomyopathy induced by a maternal Western diet by bolstering glutathione synthesis and enhancing GPx activity, thereby scavenging mitochondrial ROS and modulating oxidative phosphorylation pathways.",

The human gut ecosystem consists of almost 2000 different species of bacteria, forming a bioreactor fueled by dietary micronutrients to produce bioreactive compounds, which are absorbed by our body and signal to distant organs. Studies have shown that the Western diet, with fewer short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can alter the gut microbiome composition and cause the host's epigenetic reprogramming. Additionally, overproduction of H2S from the gut microbiome due to changes in diet patterns can further activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in UC. This review discusses how the Western diet affects the microbiome's function and alters the host's physiological homeostasis and susceptibility to UC. This article also covers the epidemiology, prognosis, pathophysiology, and current treatment strategies for UC, and how they are linked to colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that causes severe liver damage, fibrosis, and scarring. Despite its potential to progress to cirrhosis or hepatic failure, approved drugs or treatments are currently unavailable. We developed 4,4-diallyl curcumin bis(2,2-hydroxymethyl)propanoate, also known as 35e, which induces upregulation of mitochondrial proteins including carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), carnitine palmitoyltransferase II, heat shock protein 60, and translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20. Among these proteins, the upregulated expression of CPT-I was most prominent. CPT-I plays a crucial role in transporting carnitine across the mitochondrial inner membrane, thereby initiating mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids. Given recent research showing that CPT-I activation could be a viable pathway for NASH treatment, we hypothesized that 35e could serve as a potential agent for treating NASH. The efficacy of 35e in treating NASH was evaluated in methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet- and Western diet (WD)-induced models that mimic human NASH. In the MCD diet-induced model, both short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (7 weeks) treatment with 35e effectively regulated elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations and histological inflammation. However, the antisteatotic effect of 35e was obtained only in the short-term treatment group. As a comparative compound in the MCD diet-induced model, curcumin treatment did not produce significant regulatory effects on the liver triglyceride/total cholesterol, serum ALT/AST, or hepatic steatosis. In the WD-induced model, 35e ameliorated hepatic steatosis and hepatic inflammation, while increasing serum AST and hepatic lipid content. A decrease in epididymal adipose tissue weight and serum free fatty acid concentration suggested that 35e may promote lipid metabolism or impede lipid accumulation. Overall, 35e displayed significant antilipid accumulation and antifibrotic effects in the two complementary mice models. The development of new curcumin derivatives with the ability to induce CPT-I upregulation could further underscore their efficacy as anti-NASH agents.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Blockade of activin 2 receptor (ACVR2) signaling has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and aid in weight loss. Inhibition of ACVR2 signaling restores cardiac function in multiple heart failure models. However, its potential in the treatment of obesity-related cardiometabolic disease remains unknown. Here, we investigated targeting ACVR2 signaling in cardiometabolic disease manifested with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). METHODS: Mice were fed a high-fat, high-sugar diet combined with the administration of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME in drinking water, which causes hypertensive stress. For the last eight weeks, the mice were treated with the soluble ACVR2B decoy receptor (sACVR2B-Fc). RESULTS: sACVR2B-Fc protected against the development of comorbidities associated with cardiometabolic disease. This was most pronounced in the liver where ACVR2 blockade attenuated the development of MASLD including cessation of pro-fibrotic activation. It also significantly reduced total plasma cholesterol levels, impeded brown adipose tissue whitening, and improved cardiac diastolic function. In vitro, ACVR2 ligands activin A, activin B and GDF11 induced profibrotic signaling and the proliferation of human cardiac fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Blockade of ACVR2B exerts broad beneficial effects for therapy of cardiometabolic disease. By reducing obesity, ameliorating cardiovascular deterioration and restraining MASLD, blockade of ACVR2B signaling proves a potential target in MASLD and its comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Mouse models of diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus provide powerful tools for studying the structural and physiological changes that are related to the disease progression. In this study, diabetic-like glucose dysregulation was induced in mice by feeding them a western diet, and light and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the ultrastructural changes in the pancreatic acinar cells. Acinar necrosis and vacuolization of the cytoplasm were the most prominent features. Furthermore, we observed intracellular and extracellular accumulation of lipid compounds in the form of lipid droplets, structural enlargement of the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and altered mitochondrial morphology, with mitochondria lacking the typical organization of the inner membrane. Last, autophagic structures, i.e., autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and residual bodies, were abundant within the acinar cells of western diet-fed mice, and the autolysosomes contained lipids and material of varying electron density. While diets inducing obesity and type 2 diabetes are clearly associated with structural changes and dysfunction of the endocrine pancreas, we here demonstrate the strong effect of dietary intervention on the structure of acinar cells in the exocrine part of the organ before detectable changes in plasma amylase activity, which may help us better understand the development of non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease and its association with endo- and exocrine dysfunction."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of diet type on benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced colon cancer in an adult male rat model, the Polyposis In the Rat Colon (PIRC) kindred type. Groups of PIRC rats (n = 10) were fed with AIN-76A regular diet (RD) or Western diet (WD) and received 25, 50 and 100 µg B(a)P/kg body wt. via oral gavage for 60 days. Rats fed diets alone, but no B(a)P, served as controls. After exposure, rats were euthanized; colon and liver samples were analyzed for activation of drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) CYP1A1, CYP1B1, SULT and GST. Plasma and tissue samples were analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC for B(a)P metabolites. In addition to these studies, DNA isolated from colon and liver tissues was analyzed for B(a)P-induced DNA adducts by the 32P-postlabeling method using a thin-layer chromatography system. Western diet consumption resulted in a marked increase in DME expression and B(a)P metabolite concentrations in rats that were administered 100 µg/kg B(a)P + WD (p < 0.05) compared to other treatment groups. Our findings demonstrate that WD accelerates the development of colon tumors induced by B(a)P through enhanced biotransformation, and the products of this process (metabolites) were found to bind with DNA and form B(a)P-DNA adducts, which may have given rise to colon polyps characterized by gain in tumor number, sizes, and dysplasia."

      "abstract": "Western diet (WD) consumption during early life developmental periods is associated with impaired memory function, particularly for hippocampus (HPC)-dependent processes. We developed an early life WD rodent model associated with long-lasting HPC dysfunction to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms mediating these effects. Rats received either a cafeteria-style WD (ad libitum access to various high-fat/high-sugar foods; CAF) or standard healthy chow (CTL) during the juvenile and adolescent stages (postnatal days 26-56). Behavioral and metabolic assessments were performed both before and after a healthy diet intervention period beginning at early adulthood. Results revealed HPC-dependent contextual episodic memory impairments in CAF rats that persisted despite the healthy diet intervention. Given that dysregulated HPC acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is associated with memory impairments in humans and animal models, we examined protein markers of ACh tone in the dorsal HPC (HPCd) in CAF and CTL rats. Results revealed significantly lower protein levels of vesicular ACh transporter in the HPCd of CAF vs. CTL rats, indicating chronically reduced ACh tone. Using intensity-based ACh sensing fluorescent reporter (iAChSnFr) in vivo fiber photometry targeting the HPCd, we next revealed that ACh release during object-contextual novelty recognition was highly predictive of memory performance and was disrupted in CAF vs. CTL rats. Neuropharmacological results showed that alpha 7 nicotinic ACh receptor agonist infusion in the HPCd during training rescued memory deficits in CAF rats. Overall, these findings reveal a functional connection linking early life WD intake with long-lasting dysregulation of HPC ACh signaling, thereby identifying an underlying mechanism for WD-associated memory impairments.",

Here, we investigated the effects of maternal aerobic exercise (AE) and Western diet (WD) on brain development, cognitive flexibility, and memory of progenies. Sixteen adult female mice were assigned to AE or sedentary groups (SED) and fed a balanced diet (BD) or WD. Offspring were categorized into four groups: WD + AE, WD + SED, BD + AE, and BD + SED. The AE group showed enhanced spontaneous alternation in the T-maze test, suggesting an improvement in working memory and tasks related to cognitive flexibility. The novel object recognition (NOR) test showed that the BD + AE pups improved their absolute discrimination and discrimination index at 24 h, which suggests a delay in memory consolidation without affecting evocation. WD + SED showed poorer discrimination and recognition memory. The pups of AE mothers had better efficiency in short-term memory, whereas WD offspring showed low performance in long-term memory. Interestingly, exercise improved tasks related to cognitive flexibility, regardless of the diet. These findings indicate that maternal diet and physical activity modify offspring development and suggest that maternal AE during pregnancy could be a beneficial intervention to counteract the adverse effects of WD by improving spatial memory and cognitive flexibility in offspring.",

Since there is no pharmacological therapy approved for this disease, mechanistic studies are warranted. In this work, we investigated the action of carnosine (CAR), a natural dipeptide with several protection roles against oxidative stress in the liver of NAFLD rats. NAFLD was induced by WD-rich sugars and fat, verifying the histological evidence of steatosis. As intraperitoneal administration of CAR reversed liver steatosis, the protein profiles of NAFLD liver and CAR NAFLD liver were evaluated by label-free proteomics approach. A total of 2531 proteins were identified and the 230 and 276 were significantly up- and downregulated, respectively, by CAR treatment of NAFLD rats and involved in fundamental pathways such as oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. Perilipin 2 and apolipoprotein E, components of the plasma membrane of vesicle, resulted in highly downregulated in the CAR-treated NAFLD liver. The advanced bioanalytical approach demonstrated the efficacy of CAR in overcoming the main symptoms of NAFLD, ameliorating the steatosis in the liver.",

Obesity is a known risk factor of NASH, which, in turn, increases the risk of developing cirrhosis (liver scarring) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition to being a potentially life-threatening condition, public health concerns surrounding NASH are amplified by the lack of FDA-approved treatments. Although various preclinical models reflecting both the histopathology and the pathophysiological progression of human NASH exist, most of these models are diet-based and require 6-13 months for NASH symptom manifestation. Here, we describe a simple and rapid-progression model of NASH and NASH-driven HCC in mice. Mice received a western diet equivalent (WD; i.e., a high-fat, high-fructose, and high-cholesterol diet), high-sugar water (23.1 g/L fructose and 18.9 g/L glucose), and weekly intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) at a dose of 0.2 μL/g of body weight. The resulting phenotype, consisting in liver fibrosis and HCC, appeared within 24 weeks of diet/treatment initiation and presented similar histological and transcriptomic features as human NASH and NASH-driven HCC, thereby supporting the adequacy of this preclinical model for the development and evaluation of drugs that can prevent or reverse these diseases.",

NAFLD is caused by numerous factors, including the genetic susceptibility, oxidative stress, unhealthy diet, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Among these, gut microbiota is a key factor and plays an important role in the development of NAFLD. Therefore, modulating the composition and structure of gut microbiota might provide a new intervention strategy for NAFLD. Highland barley β-glucan (HBG) is a polysaccharide that can interact with gut microbiota after entering the lower gastrointestinal tract and subsequently improves NAFLD. Therefore, a Western diet was used to induce NAFLD in mouse models and the intervention effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of HBG on NAFLD mice based on gut microbiota were explored. The results indicated that HBG could regulate the composition of gut microbiota in NAFLD mice. In particular, HBG increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria (Prevotella-9, Bacteroides, and Roseburia) as well as SCFA contents. The increase in SCFA contents might activate the adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, thereby improving the liver lipid metabolism disorder and reducing liver lipid deposition.",

This study investigated the potential of HFWD to alter silica-induced effects on airway epithelial ion transport and smooth muscle reactivity. METHODS: Six-week-old male F344 rats were fed a HFWD or standard rat chow (STD) and exposed to silica (Min-U-Sil 5®, 15 mg/m3, 6 h/day, 5 days/week, for 39 d) or filtered air. Experimental endpoints were measured at 0, 4, and 8 weeks post-exposure. Transepithelial potential difference (Vt), short-circuit current (ISC) and transepithelial resistance (Rt) were measured in tracheal segments and ion transport inhibitors [amiloride, Na+ channel blocker; NPPB; Cl- channel blocker; ouabain, Na+, K+-pump blocker] identified changes in ion transport pathways. Changes in airway smooth muscle reactivity to methacholine (MCh) were investigated in the isolated perfused trachea preparation. RESULTS: Silica reduced basal ISC at 4 weeks and HFWD reduced the ISC response to amiloride at 0 week compared to air control. HFWD + silica exposure induced changes in ion transport 0 and 4 weeks after treatment compared to silica or HFWD treatments alone. No effects on airway smooth muscle reactivity to MCh were observed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Maternal exposure during pregnancy is a strong determinant of offspring health outcomes. Such exposure induces changes in the offspring epigenome resulting in gene expression and functional changes. In this study, we investigated the effect of maternal Western hypercaloric diet (HCD) programming during the perinatal period on neuronal plasticity and cardiometabolic health in adult offspring. METHODS: C57BL/6J dams were fed HCD for 1 month prior to mating with regular diet (RD) sires and kept on the same diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, offspring were maintained on either HCD or RD for 3 months resulting in 4 treatment groups that underwent cardiometabolic assessments. DNA and RNA were extracted from the hypothalamus to perform whole genome methylation, mRNA, and miRNA sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. RESULTS: Maternal programming resulted in male-specific hypertension and hyperglycemia, with both males and females showing increased sympathetic tone to the vasculature. Surprisingly, programmed male offspring fed HCD in adulthood exhibited lower glucose levels, less insulin resistance, and leptin levels compared to non-programmed HCD-fed male mice. Hypothalamic genes involved in inflammation and type 2 diabetes were targeted by differentially expressed miRNA, while genes involved in glial and astrocytic differentiation were differentially methylated in programmed male offspring. These data were supported by our findings of astrogliosis, microgliosis and increased microglial activation in programmed males in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Programming induced a protective effect in male mice fed HCD in adulthood, resulting in lower protein levels of hypothalamic TGFβ2, NF-κB2, NF-κBp65, Ser-pIRS1, and GLP1R compared to non-programmed HCD-fed males. Although TGFβ2 was upregulated in male mice exposed to HCD pre- or post-natally, only blockade of the brain TGFβ receptor in RD-HCD mice improved glucose tolerance and a trend to weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that maternal HCD programs neuronal plasticity in the offspring and results in male-specific hypertension and hyperglycemia associated with hypothalamic inflammation in mechanisms and pathways distinct from post-natal HCD exposure. Together, our data unmask a compensatory role of HCD programming, likely via priming of metabolic pathways to handle excess nutrients in a more efficient way.",

However, the precise critical developmental window(s) during which WD exposure negatively impacts hippocampal function are unknown. Here, we exposed male and female rats to a WD model involving free access to a variety of high-fat and/or high-sugar food and drink items during either the early-adolescent period (postnatal days [PN] 26-41; WD-EA) or late-adolescent period (PN 41-56; WD-LA). Control (CTL) rats were given healthy standard chow throughout both periods. To evaluate long-lasting memory capacity well beyond the early life WD exposure periods, we performed behavioral assessments after both a short (4 weeks for WD-EA, 2 weeks for WD-LA) and long (12 weeks for WD-EA, 10 weeks for WD-LA) period of healthy diet intervention. Results revealed no differences in body weight or body composition between diet groups, regardless of sex. Following the shorter period of healthy diet intervention, both male and female WD-EA and WD-LA rats showed deficits in hippocampal-dependent memory compared to CTL rats. Following the longer healthy diet intervention period, memory impairments persisted in male WD-EA but not WD-LA rats. In contrast, in female rats the longer healthy diet intervention reversed the initial memory impairments in both WD-EA and WD-LA rats. Collectively, these findings reveal that early-adolescence is a critical period of long-lasting hippocampal vulnerability to dietary insults in male but not female rats, thus highlighting developmental- and sex-specific effects mediating the relationship between the early life nutritional environment and long-term cognitive health.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal permeability is a physiological property that allows necessary molecules to enter the organism. This property is regulated by tight junction proteins located between intestinal epithelial cells. However, various factors can increase intestinal permeability (IIP), including diet. Specific components in the Western diet (WD), such as monosaccharides, fat, gluten, salt, alcohol, and additives, can affect the tight junctions between enterocytes, leading to increased permeability. This review explains how these components promote IIP and outlines their potential implications for health. In addition, we describe how a reduction in WD consumption may help improve dietary treatment of diseases associated with IIP. Research has shown that some of these components can cause changes in the gut microbiota, leading to dysbiosis, which can promote greater intestinal permeability and displacement of endotoxins into the bloodstream. These endotoxins include lipopolysaccharides derived from gram-negative bacteria, and their presence has been associated with various diseases, such as autoimmune, neurological, and metabolic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, nutrition professionals should promote the reduction of WD consumption and consider the inclusion of healthy diet components as part of the nutritional treatment for diseases associated with increased intestinal permeability.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice on a Western diet were exposed to CNF for one month at a dose of 30 mg/kg by gavage. Male NOD mice, a model for type 1 diabetes (T1D), were used in a six-month study. KEY FINDINGS: Sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes suggested significant changes in gut microbiome of male C57BL/6 mice exposed to CNF. Analysis of functional metagenomics indicated that many of the functional contents that might be altered following CNF ingestion were associated with lipid and carbohydrate processing. Further studies in NOD mice suggested that there were some decreases in the blood glucose levels during the insulin tolerance test and glucose tolerance test following CNF treatment. However, these small decreases were not considered biologically meaningful as there were no significant changes in either the area under the curve or the first-order rate constant for glucose disappearance. Moreover, serum concentrations of cytokines/chemokines including IL-3, IL-12(p70) and the keratinocyte chemoattractant were increased following chronic exposure to CNF. In addition, behavioral studies suggested that the percentage of immobility time during the tail-suspension test was significantly increased following six months of exposure to CNF in NOD mice, signifying an increase in depression-related behavior. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, long-term CNF consumption was associated with changes in the ecology of the gut microbiome, immune homeostasis, and possibly energy metabolism and mental health in male NOD mice on a Western diet.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria is an efficient and innovative new technique aimed at preserving bacterial survival in the hostile conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. However, understanding whether a microcapsule preserves the effectiveness of the bacterium contained within it is of fundamental importance. METHODS: Male Wistar rats aged 90 days were fed a control diet or a Western diet for 8 weeks, with rats fed the Western diet divided into three groups: one receiving the diet only (W), the second group receiving the Western diet and free L. reuteri DSM 17938 (WR), and the third group receiving the Western diet and microencapsulated L. reuteri DSM 17938 (WRM). After 8 weeks of treatment, gut microbiota composition was evaluated, together with occludin, one of the tight junction proteins, in the ileum and the colon. Markers of inflammation were also quantified in the portal plasma, ileum, and colon, as well as markers for gut redox homeostasis. RESULTS: The Western diet negatively influenced the intestinal microbiota, with no significant effect caused by supplementation with free and microencapsulated L. reuteri. However, L. reuteri, in both forms, effectively preserved the integrity of the intestinal barrier, thus protecting enterocytes from the development of inflammation and oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: From these whole data, it emerges that L. reuteri DSM 17938 can be an effective probiotic in preventing the unhealthy consequences of the Western diet, especially in the gut, and that microencapsulation preserves the probiotic effects, thus opening the formulation of new preparations to be able to improve gut function independent of dietary habits."

      "abstract": "Metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are increasingly prevalent worldwide, necessitating a deeper comprehension of their underlying mechanisms. However, translating findings from animal research to human patients remains challenging. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of Streptozotocin (STZ) on metabolic, cardiac, and somatosensory function in mice fed a Western diet (WD) of high fat, sucrose, and cholesterol with low doses of STZ administration compared to mice fed WD alone. In our research, we thoroughly characterized energy balance and glucose homeostasis, as well as allodynia and cardiac function, all of which have been previously shown to be altered by WD feeding. Notably, our findings revealed that the treatment of WD-fed mice with STZ exacerbated dysfunction in glucose homeostasis via reduced insulin secretion in addition to impaired peripheral insulin signaling. Furthermore, both WD and WD + STZ mice exhibited the same degree of cardiac autonomic neuropathy, such as reduced heart rate variability and decreased protein levels of cardiac autonomic markers. Furthermore, both groups developed the same symptoms of neuropathic pain, accompanied by elevated levels of activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) in the dorsal root ganglia. These discoveries enhance our understanding of metabolic activity, insulin resistance, neuropathy, and cardiac dysfunction of diet-induced models of obesity and diabetes. The exacerbation of impaired insulin signaling pathways by STZ did not lead to or worsen cardiac and somatosensory dysfunction. Additionally, they offer valuable insights into suitable diet induced translational mouse models, thereby advancing the development of potential interventions for associated conditions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study was designed to develop an understanding of the pathophysiology of traumatic muscle injury in the context of Western diet (WD; high fat and high sugar) and obesity. The objective was to interrogate the combination of WD and injury on skeletal muscle mass and contractile and metabolic function. METHODS: Male and female C57BL/6J mice were randomized into four groups based on a two-factor study design: (1) injury (uninjured vs. volumetric muscle loss [VML]) and (2) diet (WD vs. normal chow [NC]). Electrophysiology was used to test muscle strength and metabolic function in cohorts of uninjured + NC, uninjured + WD, VML + NC and VML + WD at 8 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: VML-injured male and female mice both exhibited decrements in muscle mass (-17%, P < 0.001) and muscle strength (-28%, P < 0.001); however, VML + WD females had a 28% greater muscle mass compared to VML + NC females (P = 0.034), a compensatory response not detected in males. VML-injured male and female mice both had lower carbohydrate- and fat-supported muscle mitochondrial respiration (JO2 ) and less electron conductance through the electron transport system (ETS); however, male VML-WD had 48% lower carbohydrate-supported JO2 (P = 0.014) and 47% less carbohydrate-supported electron conductance (P = 0.026) compared to male VML + NC, and this diet-injury phenotype was not present in females. ETS electron conductance starts with complex I and complex II dehydrogenase enzymes at the inner mitochondrial membrane, and male VML + WD had 31% less complex I activity (P = 0.004) and 43% less complex II activity (P = 0.005) compared to male VML + NC. This was a diet-injury phenotype not present in females. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase metabolic enzyme activities were evaluated as potential drivers of impaired JO2 in the context of diet and injury. There were notable male and female differential effects in the enzyme activity and post-translational regulation of PDH. PDH enzyme activity was 24% less in VML-injured males, independent of diet (P < 0.001), but PDH enzyme activity was not influenced by injury in females. PDH enzyme activity is inhibited by phosphorylation at serine-293 by PDH kinase 4 (PDK4). In males, there was greater total PDH, phospho-PDHser293 and phospho-PDH-to-total PDH ratio in WD mice compared to NC, independent of injury (P ≤ 0.041). In females, PDK4 was 51% greater in WD compared to NC, independent of injury (P = 0.025), and was complemented by greater phospho-PDHser293 (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Males are more susceptible to muscle metabolic dysfunction in the context of combined WD and traumatic injury compared to females, and this may be due to impaired metabolic enzyme functions.",

The results showed that LU intervention 1) decreased the levels of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 2) increased the succinate dehydrogenase activity of mitochondrial enzyme; and 3) increased mitochondrial biogenesis by upregulating the AMPK/PGC-1α pathway.

Identifying early gene indicators contributing to the onset and progression of NAFLD has the potential to develop novel targets for early therapeutic intervention. We report on the early and late transcriptomic signatures of western diet (WD)-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in female and male Ldlr-/- mice, with time-points at 1 week and 40 weeks on the WD. Control Ldlr-/- mice were maintained on a low-fat diet (LFD) for 1 and 40 weeks. METHODS: The approach included quantitation of anthropometric and hepatic histology markers of disease as well as the hepatic transcriptome. RESULTS: Only mice fed the WD for 40 weeks revealed evidence of NASH, i.e., hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. RNASeq transcriptome analysis, however, revealed multiple cell-specific changes in gene expression after 1 week that persisted to 40 weeks on the WD. These early markers of disease include induction of acute phase response (Saa1-2, Orm2), fibrosis (Col1A1, Col1A2, TGFβ) and NASH associated macrophage (NAM, i.e., Trem2 high, Mmp12 low). We also noted the induction of transcripts associated with metabolic syndrome, including Mmp12, Trem2, Gpnmb, Lgals3 and Lpl. Finally, 1 week of WD feeding was sufficient to significantly induce TNFα, a cytokine involved in both hepatic and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: This study revealed early onset changes in the hepatic transcriptome that develop well before any anthropometric or histological evidence of NALFD or NASH and pointed to cell-specific targeting for the prevention of disease progression."

      "abstract": "Western diet (WD) consumption during development yields long-lasting memory impairments, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain elusive. Here we developed an early life WD rodent model to evaluate whether dysregulated hippocampus (HPC) acetylcholine (ACh) signaling, a pathology associated with memory impairment in human dementia, is causally-related to WD-induced cognitive impairment. Rats received a cafeteria-style WD (access to various high-fat/high-sugar foods; CAF) or healthy chow (CTL) during the juvenile and adolescent periods (postnatal days 26-56). Behavioral, metabolic, and microbiome assessments were performed both before and after a 30-day healthy diet intervention beginning at early adulthood. Results revealed CAF-induced HPC-dependent contextual episodic memory impairments that persisted despite healthy diet intervention, whereas CAF was not associated with long-term changes in body weight, body composition, glucose tolerance, anxiety-like behavior, or gut microbiome. HPC immunoblot analyses after the healthy diet intervention identified reduced levels of vesicular ACh transporter in CAF vs. CTL rats, indicative of chronically reduced HPC ACh tone. To determine whether these changes were functionally related to memory impairments, we evaluated temporal HPC ACh binding via ACh-sensing fluorescent reporter in vivo fiber photometry during memory testing, as well as whether the memory impairments could be rescued pharmacologically. Results revealed dynamic HPC ACh binding during object-contextual novelty recognition was highly predictive of memory performance and was disrupted in CAF vs. CTL rats. Further, HPC alpha-7 nicotinic receptor agonist infusion during consolidation rescued memory deficits in CAF rats. Overall, these findings identify dysregulated HPC ACh signaling as a mechanism underlying early life WD-associated memory impairments."

AIM: we evaluated if female apolipoprotein E (ApoE) KO mice were protected against Western-diet (WD)-induced NASH. METHODS: Female ovariectomized (OVX) ApoE KO mice or sham-operated (SHAM) mice were fed either a WD or a regular chow (RC) for 7 weeks. Additionally, OVX mice fed a WD were treated with either estradiol (OVX + E2) or vehicle (OVX). RESULTS: Whole-body fat, plasma glucose, and plasma insulin were increased and associated with increased glucose intolerance in OVX mice fed a WD (OVX + WD). Plasma and hepatic triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) hepatic enzymes were also increased in the plasma of OVX + WD group, which was associated with hepatic fibrosis and inflammation. Estradiol replacement in OVX mice reduced body weight, body fat, glycemia, and plasma insulin associated with reduced glucose intolerance.

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into the control (CON), Western-style diets (WD), lactoferrin (Lf), and Lf + antibiotics (AB) groups. The Lf group was intragastrically administered with Lf, and the Lf + AB group additionally drank a solution with antibiotics. After 16 weeks of intervention, Lf improved the cognitive function as indicated by behavioral tests. Lf also increased the length and curvature of postsynaptic density and upregulated the related protein expression, suggesting improved hippocampal neurons and synapses. Lf suppressed microglia activation and proliferation as revealed by immunofluorescence analysis. Lf decreased the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and downregulated their protein expressions in the hippocampus region. Lf also inhibited the activation of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasomes in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, Lf upregulated the expression of tight junction proteins, and increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes at phylum and Roseburia at genus, which are beneficial for gut barrier and cognitive function. The antibiotics eliminated the effects of long-term Lf intervention on cognitive impairment in the Lf + AB group, suggesting that gut microbiota participated in Lf action. Short-term Lf intervention (2 weeks) prevented WD-induced gut microbiota alteration without inducing behavioral changes, supporting the timing sequence of gut microbiota to the brain. Thus, Lf intervention alleviated cognitive impairment by inhibiting microglial activation and neuroinflammation through the microbiome-gut-brain axis."

This study revealed the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum AR113 and L. plantarum AR113Δbsh1 on a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model under the Western diet (WD). After four weeks of WD and low-sugar and low-fat diet (LD) intervention, induction with 3% DSS, and intragastric administration of probiotics, we found that L. plantarum AR113 could regulate blood glucose and lipid levels and have a certain protective effect on hepatocytes. Our results suggested that the L. plantarum AR113 alleviated DSS-induced colitis under the Western diet by improving dyslipidemia, repairing intestinal barrier dysfunction, and inhibiting the TLR4/Myd88/TRAF-6/NF-κB inflammatory pathway. However, these changes were not demonstrated in the L. plantarum AR113Δbsh1, and therefore, we reasoned that the presence of bsh1 may play a crucial role in the L. plantarum AR113 exerting its anti-inflammatory function.

On this background, we speculated that the blockade of Na/K-ATPase-induced ROS amplification with a specific peptide, pNaKtide, might attenuate the development of steatohepatitis. To test this hypothesis, pNaKtide was administered to a murine model of NASH: the C57Bl6 mouse fed a \"western\" diet containing high amounts of fat and fructose. The administration of pNaKtide reduced obesity as well as hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Of interest, we also noted a marked improvement in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia and aortic streaking in this mouse model. To further elucidate the effects of pNaKtide on atherosclerosis, similar studies were performed in ApoE knockout mice also exposed to the western diet. In these mice, pNaKtide not only improved steatohepatitis, dyslipidemia, and insulin sensitivity but also ameliorated significant aortic atherosclerosis. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the Na/K-ATPase/ROS amplification loop contributes significantly to the development and progression of steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, this study presents a potential treatment, the pNaKtide, for the metabolic syndrome phenotype.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is significant overlap between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) with regards to risk factors and disease progression. However, the mechanism by which fatty liver disease arises from concomitant obesity and overconsumption of alcohol (syndrome of metabolic and alcohol-associated fatty liver disease; SMAFLD), is not fully understood. METHODS: Male C57BL6/J mice were fed chow diet (Chow) or high-fructose, high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (FFC) for 4 weeks, then administered either saline or ethanol (EtOH, 5% in drinking water) for another 12 weeks. The EtOH treatment also consisted of a weekly 2.5 g EtOH/kg body weight gavage. Markers for lipid regulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis were measured by RT-qPCR, RNA-seq, Western blot, and metabolomics. RESULTS: Combined FFC-EtOH induced more body weight gain, glucose intolerance, steatosis, and hepatomegaly compared to Chow, EtOH, or FFC. Glucose intolerance by FFC-EtOH was associated with decreased hepatic protein kinase B (AKT) protein expression and increased gluconeogenic gene expression. FFC-EtOH increased hepatic triglyceride and ceramide levels, plasma leptin levels, hepatic Perilipin 2 protein expression, and decreased lipolytic gene expression. FFC and FFC-EtOH also increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Finally, FFC-EtOH enriched the hepatic transcriptome for genes involved in immune response and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In our model of early SMAFLD, we observed that the combination of an obesogenic diet and alcohol caused more weight gain, promoted glucose intolerance, and contributed to steatosis by dysregulating leptin/AMPK signaling. Our model demonstrates that the combination of an obesogenic diet with a chronic-binge pattern alcohol intake is worse than either insult alone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-term intake of a Western diet (WD), characterized by a high-fat content and sugary drinks, is hypothesized to contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the identified clinical association, the molecular mechanisms by which dietary changes contribute to IBD development remain unknown. Therefore, we examined the influence of long-term intake of a WD on intestinal inflammation and the mechanisms by which WD intake affects IBD development. METHODS: Mice fed normal diet or WD for 10 weeks, and bowel inflammation was evaluated through pathohistological and infiltrated inflammatory cell assessments. To understand the role of intestinal taste receptor type 1 member 3 (TAS1R3) in WD-induced intestinal inflammation, cultured enteroendocrine cells harboring TAS1R3, subjected to RNA interference or antagonist treatment, and Tas1r3-deficient mice were used. RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry, 16S metagenomic sequencing, and bioinformatics analyses were performed to examine the involved mechanisms. To demonstrate their clinical relevance, intestinal biopsies from patients with IBD and mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were analyzed. RESULTS: Our study revealed for the first time that intestinal TAS1R3 is a critical mediator of WD-induced intestinal inflammation. WD-fed mice showed marked TAS1R3 overexpression with hallmarks of serious bowel inflammation. Conversely, mice lacking TAS1R3 failed to exhibit inflammatory responses to WD. Mechanistically, intestinal transcriptome analysis revealed that Tas1r3 deficiency suppressed mTOR signaling, significantly increasing the expression of PPARγ (a major mucosal defense enhancer) and upregulating the expression of PPARγ target-gene (tight junction protein and antimicrobial peptide). The gut microbiota of Tas1r3-deficient mice showed expansion of butyrate-producing Clostridia. Moreover, an increased expression of host PPARγ-signaling pathway proteins was positively correlated with butyrate-producing microbes, suggesting that intestinal TAS1R3 regulates the relationship between host metabolism and gut microflora in response to dietary factors. In cultured intestinal cells, regulation of the TAS1R3-mTOR-PPARγ axis was critical for triggering an inflammatory response via proinflammatory cytokine production and secretion. Abnormal regulation of the axis was observed in patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the TAS1R3-mTOR-PPARγ axis in the gut links Western diet consumption with intestinal inflammation and is a potential therapeutic target for IBD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The immunosuppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs) regulate immune responses and maintain immune homeostasis, yet their functions in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis remains controversial. METHODS: Mice were fed a normal diet (ND) or a western diet (WD) for 16 weeks to induce NAFLD. Diphtheria toxin injection to deplete Tregs in Foxp3 DTR mice or Treg induction therapy in WT mice to augment Treg numbers was initiated at twelve and eight weeks, respectively. Liver tissues from mice and NASH human subjects were analyzed by histology, confocal imaging, and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: WD triggered accumulation of adaptive immune cells, including Tregs and effector T cells, within the liver parenchyma. This pattern was also observed in NASH patients, where an increase in intrahepatic Tregs was noted. In the absence of adaptive immune cells in Rag1 KO mice, WD promoted accumulation of intrahepatic neutrophils and macrophages and exacerbated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Similarly, targeted Treg depletion exacerbated WD-induced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. In Treg-depleted mice, hepatic injury was associated with increased accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages, and activated T cells within the liver. Conversely, induction of Tregs using recombinant IL2/αIL2 mAb cocktail reduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in WD-fed mice. Analysis of intrahepatic Tregs from WD-fed mice revealed a phenotypic signature of impaired Treg function in NAFLD. Ex vivo functional studies showed that glucose and palmitate, but not fructose, impaired the immunosuppressive ability of Treg cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the liver microenvironment in NAFLD impairs ability of Tregs to suppress effector immune cell activation, thus perpetuating chronic inflammation and driving NAFLD progression. These data suggest that targeted approaches aimed at restoring Treg function may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treating NAFLD. LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the perpetuation of chronic hepatic inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We show that dietary sugar and fatty acids promote chronic hepatic inflammation in NAFLD by impairing immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells. Finally, our preclinical data suggest that targeted approaches aimed at restoring T regulatory cell function have the potential to treat NAFLD."

      "abstract": "The Western diet (WD) predisposes to bodyweight gain and obesity and is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, inflammation, and multisystem disease, even affecting the reproductive organs, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes. In this study, we investigated the effects of multi-ingredient supplementation (MIS) with antioxidants, phytonutrients, and vitamins ('Fertility Enhancer'; FE) on white adipose tissue (WAT) expansion, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and infertility in WD-fed C57BL/6J mice. Five-month-old male (M) and female (F) mice were fed a low-fat diet (LF) or a high fat/sucrose WD (HF) for six weeks, followed by six weeks of LF (3.64 kcal/g), HF (4.56 kcal/g), or HF combined with FE (4.50 kcal/g). A sub-set of animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks, while the remainder were harem-mated in a 1:2 male-to-female ratio, and singly housed during the gestational period. Two-way, factorial ANOVA analysis revealed a main effect of diet on bodyweight (BW), total body fat, % body fat, white adipose tissue mass, and liver lipid content (all p < 0.001), driven by the anti-obesogenic effects of the 'Fertility Enhancer'. Similarly, a main effect of diet was found on PGC1-α mRNA levels (p < 0.05) and mitochondrial protein content (p < 0.001) in perigonadal WAT, with PGC1-α induction and higher complex II and complex III expression in FE vs. HF animals. Copulatory plug counts were higher in FE vs. HE couples (30% vs. 6%), resulting in more litters (4 vs. 0) and higher copulatory success (67% vs. 0%). Although the trends of all histology outcomes were suggestive of a benefit from the FE diet, only the number of atretic follicles and testicular mass were significant. Ovarian IL-1β mRNA induction was significantly attenuated in the FE group (p < 0.05 vs. HF) with CASP1 attenuation trending lower (p = 0.09 vs. HF), which is indicative of anti-inflammatory benefits of the 'Fertility Enhancer.' We conclude that supplementation with specific phytonutrients, antioxidants, and vitamins may have utility as an adjunctive therapy for weight management, fatty liver disease, and infertility in overweight and obese couples.",

The growing scale of the problem not only concerns adults, but now it particularly affects children and adolescents. Prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders in adolescence is crucial because adolescent depression is a risk factor for recurrence of depression later in life, as well as many other mental health disorders in adulthood. The purpose of this study was to analyze data on the dietary patterns and composition of the Mediterranean diet as a modifiable risk factor for depression, which would be a viable prevention strategy and a good target for early intervention and supportive treatment of depression. Research shows that the Mediterranean diet pattern can reduce the risk and symptoms of depression, while western eating styles can increase the risk and severity of depression in adolescents. The number of studies in adolescent populations continues to increase, but most longitudinal and clinical studies are still insufficient. Modification of the diet can be a helpful strategy for the prevention and treatment of depression in adolescents; therefore, the diet of young people should be considered a key and modifiable goal in the prevention of mental disorders.",

Because one of the main health effects of cereal β-glucan (BG) is its ability to lower cholesterol by interacting with BAs, BG may regulate imbalances of the metabolism of BAs during NAFLD. Therefore, by using metabolic tests coupled with the profiling of hepatic BAs, we have assessed the effect of BG from highland barley on western diet (WD) induced NAFLD mice. BG treatment prevented fat accumulation and increased adipose lipolysis. These moderating effects were associated with an increased energy expenditure. Moreover, BG-treated mice enhanced the production of hepatic BAs, which may be connected with the activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling in the liver and inhibition of FXR signaling in the ileum. Our results suggest that BG prevents fat accumulation by increasing energy expenditure, a mechanism associated with major changes in the composition of hepatic BAs.",

UPF are encountered in Western diets (rich in saturated fat and sucrose), where consumption is directly associated with many conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, among others. Here, we administered a High-Fat, High-Sucrose (HFHS) diet to mice, enriched or not with citrate (67 mg g-1 diet), aimed to simulate UPF citrate consumption. Our results showed that citrate enrichment prevented the HFHS-induced lipid deposition in the liver and adipose tissues of the animals. Moreover, the treatment induced mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipose tissues, via upregulation of PCG1α. As a result, citrate enhancement upregulated UCP1, suggesting the browning of white adipose tissues. Nevertheless, the citrate-enhanced diet did not prevent HFHS-induced insulin resistance and causes further liver inflammation and injury. Altogether, our results clearly showed that, associated to UPF consumption, the excess of dietary citrate has caused harmful effects being associated to non-obesity related liver inflammatory diseases and insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common chronic liver disease in the US, partly due to the increasing incidence of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The roles of bile acids and their receptors, such as the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5, on the development of NASH are not fully clear. C57BL/6J male mice fed a Western diet (WD) develop characteristics of NASH, allowing determination of the effects of FXR and TGR5 agonists on this disease. Here we show that the FXR-TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 prevents progression of WD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, as determined by histological and biochemical assays and novel label-free microscopy imaging techniques, including third harmonic generation, second harmonic generation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Furthermore, we show INT-767 decreases liver fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid and cholesterol uptake, as well as liver inflammation. INT-767 markedly changed bile acid composition in the liver and intestine, leading to notable decreases in the hydrophobicity index of bile acids, known to limit cholesterol and lipid absorption. In addition, INT-767 upregulated expression of liver p-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1α, and SIRT3, which are master regulators of mitochondrial function. Finally, we found INT-767 treatment reduced WD-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Interestingly, the effects of INT-767 in attenuating NASH were absent in FXR-null mice, but still present in TGR5-null mice. Our findings support treatment and prevention protocols with the dual FXR-TGR5 agonist INT-767 arrest progression of WD-induced NASH in mice mediated by FXR-dependent, TGR5-independent mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a growing epidemiologic and economic burden. It is associated with Western diet (WD) patterns, and its pathogenesis involves metabolic disorders (obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetes) and gut dysbiosis, features that are usually neglected or not reproduced by most animal models. Thus, we established a 6-mo WD-induced NAFLD mouse model associated with metabolic disorder, investigating its main features at the gut microbiome-liver-adipose tissue axis, also evaluating the correlations of gut dysbiosis to the other disease outcomes. METHODS: Male C57 BL6 mice received a high-fat (30% lard and 0.2% cholesterol, ∼57% calories) and sucrose-rich (20%) chow, and a high-sugar solution (23.1 and 18.9 g/L of D-fructose and D-glucose) for 6 mo. RESULTS: The model featured high serum cholesterol levels, glucose intolerance, and hyperinsulinemia. WD intervention resulted in extensive macro/microvesicular liver steatosis and pericellular fibrosis-resembling human disease-accompanied by hepatic stellate cell activation and CD68+ macrophage infiltration, increased protein levels of proinflammatory p65-nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, with decreased antioxidant regulator Nrf2. Mice showed clear obesity with adipocyte hypertrophy, and CD68+macrophage/mast cell infiltration in adipose tissue while a reduction in number of goblet cells was also observed in the small intestine. Moreover, the pyrosequencing of the 16 S ribosomal RNA of gut cecal content showed decreased bacterial diversity, enriched Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, decreased Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, and increased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides had the highest number of significant correlations with liver-adipose tissue axis outcomes. In silico analysis of gut microbiome in NAFLD obese patients revealed a depletion in Bacteroides, which also correlated to disease outcomes. CONCLUSION: This mice model gathered suitable phenotypical alterations in gut-liver-adipose tissue axis that resembled NAFLD associated with metabolic disorders in humans and may be considered for preclinical investigation.",

      "abstract": "Black ginseng (BG) shows beneficial effects on liver injury, but the related mechanism has not been fully revealed. This study attempted to investigate the protective effects and associated mechanisms of BG against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Twelve ginsenosides in BG were annotated by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography combined with high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). The Western diet (WD) together with the low-dose CCl4 was given to mice to create the NASH model. Histopathological examination and liver/serum biochemical analysis revealed that the NASH mice displayed severe steatosis and liver damage compared with control mice. After BG administration, the serum and liver triglycerides (TG) concentrations and the serum level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were dramatically reduced. Besides, the BG treatment greatly decreased the serum values of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and the hepatic expression of fibrotic-related genes, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen type I alpha 1 (Col1α1). We further discovered that BG administration could block the protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65), indicating that BG exerted a liver protective effect via regulating the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. This study demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy and the associated mechanism of BG in the treatment of NASH, giving evidence for BG as a potential functional food to prevent NASH. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: BG is a type of processed ginseng product that has been used as diet supplementation and has shown favorable effects on liver injury. However, the pharmacological impact of BG on NASH has not been studied in depth. The present study showed that BG could effectively reduce WD-induced liver fibrosis and inflammation through the TLR4/NF-κB axis, which indicated that BG has the potential to be utilized as a functional herb to attenuate liver injury.",

In this study we investigated the mechanisms involved in the induction of oxidative stress and impairment of mitochondrial quality control and mitophagy in hepatocytes by the saturated fatty acid palmitate and Western diet feeding in mice and if their harmful effects could be reversed by the neurotrophic factor glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Western diet (WD)-feeding increased hepatic lipid peroxidation in control mice and, in vitro palmitate induced oxidative stress and impaired the mitophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria in hepatocytes. This was accompanied by reductions in hepatocyte sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) deacetylase activity, gene expression and protein levels as well as in superoxide dismutase enzyme activity. These reductions were reversed in the liver of Western diet fed GDNF transgenic mice and in hepatocytes exposed to palmitate in the presence of GDNF. We demonstrate an important role for Western diet and palmitate in inducing oxidative stress and impairing mitophagy in hepatocytes and an ability of GDNF to prevent this. These findings suggest that GDNF or its agonists may be a potential therapy for the prevention or treatment of NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder worldwide, causing a substantial economic burden due to the associated healthcare costs. Given that commercial anxiolytic treatments may cause important side effects and have medical restrictions for prescription and high costs, the search for new natural and safer treatments is gaining attention. Since lupin protein hydrolysate (LPH) has been shown to be safe and exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, key risk factors for the anxiety process and memory impairment, we evaluated in this study the potential effects of LPH on anxiety and spatial memory in a Western diet (WD)-induced anxiety model in ApoE-/- mice. We showed that 20.86% of the 278 identified LPH peptides have biological activity related to anxiolytic/analgesic effects; the principal motifs found were the following: VPL, PGP, YL, and GQ. Moreover, 14 weeks of intragastrical LPH treatment (100 mg/kg) restored the WD-induced anxiety effects, reestablishing the anxiety levels observed in the standard diet (SD)-fed mice since they spent less time in the anxiety zones of the elevated plus maze (EPM). Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of head dips was recorded in LPH-treated mice, which indicates a greater exploration capacity and less fear due to lower levels of anxiety. Interestingly, the LPH group showed similar thigmotaxis, a well-established indicator of animal anxiety and fear, to the SD group, counteracting the WD effect. This is the first study to show that LPH treatment has anxiolytic effects, pointing to LPH as a potential component of future nutritional therapies in patients with anxiety.",

The present study aimed to determine whether metformin exerts beneficial effects on metabolic and neurobehavioral outcomes in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D model and western diet (WD)-induced obesity model in male Swiss mice. T1D was induced by intraperitoneal injection of STZ (50 mg/kg, for five consecutive days). The animals were then treated daily with saline or metformin (200 mg/kg/day, oral gavage), and a battery of tests recapitulating different neurobehavioral anomalies related to anxiogenic/depressive-like phenotype was conducted after 18 days. WD-induced obesity was modeled in mice by high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD) feeding for 15 days. In the sequence, control and diet-induced obesity mice were treated daily with saline or metformin (200 mg/kg/day), and a battery of behavioral tests was performed after 17 days. STZ injection and WD feeding induced metabolic and neurobehavioral impairments in mice. Remarkably, metformin improved the metabolic and neurobehavioral parameters in WD-induced obesity mice. Moreover, metformin ameliorated STZ-induced neurobehavioral deficits while it failed to improve the associated metabolic impairments. The beneficial effects of metformin in STZ-induced neurobehavioral impairments were not mediated by improving peripheral insulin signaling. Our results suggest that conventional diabetes treatment could be repurposed to simultaneously improve neurobehavioral symptoms and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a health concern affecting 24% of the population worldwide. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying disease are not fully clarified, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are key players in disease progression. Consequently, efforts to develop more efficient pharmacologic strategies targeting mitochondria for NAFLD prevention/treatment are underway. The conjugation of caffeic acid anti-oxidant moiety with an alkyl linker and a triphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+), guided by structure-activity relationships, led to the development of a mitochondria-targeted anti-oxidant (AntiOxCIN4) with remarkable anti-oxidant properties. Recently, we described that AntiOxCIN4 improved mitochondrial function, upregulated anti-oxidant defense systems, and cellular quality control mechanisms (mitophagy/autophagy) via activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, preventing fatty acid-induced cell damage. Despite the data obtained, AntiOxCIN4 effects on cellular and mitochondrial energy metabolism in vivo were not studied. In the present work, we proposed that AntiOxCIN4 (2.5 mg/day/animal) may prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) phenotype development in a C57BL/6J mice fed with 30% high-fat, 30% high-sucrose diet for 16 weeks. HepG2 cells treated with AntiOxCIN4 (100 μM, 48 h) before the exposure to supraphysiologic free fatty acids (FFAs) (250 μM, 24 h) were used for complementary studies. AntiOxCIN4 decreased body (by 43%), liver weight (by 39%), and plasma hepatocyte damage markers in WD-fed mice. Hepatic-related parameters associated with a reduction of fat liver accumulation (by 600%) and the remodeling of fatty acyl chain composition compared with the WD-fed group were improved. Data from human HepG2 cells confirmed that a reduction of lipid droplets size and number can be a result from AntiOxCIN4-induced stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial OXPHOS remodeling. In WD-fed mice, AntiOxCIN4 also induced a hepatic metabolism remodeling by upregulating mitochondrial OXPHOS, anti-oxidant defense system and phospholipid membrane composition, which is mediated by the PGC-1α-SIRT3 axis. AntiOxCIN4 prevented lipid accumulation-driven autophagic flux impairment, by increasing lysosomal proteolytic capacity. AntiOxCIN4 improved NAFL phenotype of WD-fed mice, via three main mechanisms: a) increase mitochondrial function (fatty acid oxidation); b) stimulation anti-oxidant defense system (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) and; c) prevent the impairment in autophagy. Together, the findings support the potential use of AntiOxCIN4 in the prevention/treatment of NAFLD."

Chronic neuropathic pain, a symptom of peripheral neuropathy, is a major disabling symptom that leads to a poor quality of life. Glucose management for diabetic and prediabetic individuals often fail to reduce or improve pain symptoms, therefore, exploring other mechanisms is necessary to identify effective treatments. A large body of evidence suggest that lipid signaling may be a viable target for management of peripheral neuropathy in obese individuals. The nuclear transcription factors, Liver X Receptors (LXR), are known regulators of lipid homeostasis, phospholipid remodeling, and inflammation. Notably, the activation of LXR using the synthetic agonist GW3965, delayed western diet (WD)-induced allodynia in rodents. To further understand the neurobiology underlying the effect of LXR, we used translating ribosome affinity purification and evaluated translatomic changes in the sensory neurons of WD-fed mice treated with the LXR agonist GW3965. We also observed that GW3965 decreased prostaglandin levels and decreased free fatty acid content, while increasing lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol ester species in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). These data suggest novel downstream interplaying mechanisms that modifies DRG neuronal lipid following GW3965 treatment.",

      "abstract": "Current study was aimed to investigate the ability of L.acidophilus SNZ 86 to biotransform inorganic selenium to a more active organic form, resulting in trace element enrichment. Selenium-enriched L. acidophilus SNZ 86 has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal illnesses, indicating the need for additional research to determine the full potential of this therapeutic strategy in the treatment of metabolic disorders. Herein, we employed the western style diet-induced model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to explore the therapeutic effect of selenium-enriched probiotic (SP). Male Sprague Dawley rats (160-180 g) were fed a high-fat (58% Kcal of fat) and high-fructose (30% w/v) diet for 12 weeks to develop an animal model mimicking NAFLD. High-fat and High-fructose diet-fed rats exhibited hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, abnormal liver function test, increased hepatic oxidative stress, and steatosis. SP was then administered orally (L acidophilus 1 × 109 CFU/ml containing 0.4 g Se/day; p.o.) for 8 weeks. The selenium enrichment within L. acidophilus SNZ 86 was validated by TEM, which allowed for visualisation of the selenium deposition and size distribution in the probiotic. In NAFLD control rats, the expression of autophagy proteins (LC-3 A/B and Beclin), AMPK, and SIRT-1 was significantly reduced indicating downregulation of autophagy. However, supplementation of SP ameliorates hepatic steatosis as evidenced by improved biochemical markers and autophagic activation via upregulation of the AMPK and SIRT-1 pathway showing the relevance of autophagy in the disease aetiology. Collectively, these findings provide us with a better understanding of the role of SP in the treatment of hepatic steatosis and establish a therapeutic basis for potential clinical application of SP in the prevention of NAFLD and associated pathological conditions.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is an epidemic, and it is characterized by a state of low-grade systemic inflammation. A key component of inflammation is the activation of inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes that form in response to danger signals and that lead to activation of caspase-1. Previous studies have found that a Westernized diet induces activation of inflammasomes and production of inflammatory cytokines. Gut microbiota metabolites, including the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, have received increased attention as underlying some obesogenic features, but the mechanisms of action by which butyrate influences inflammation in obesity remain unclear. We engineered a caspase-1 reporter mouse model to measure spatiotemporal dynamics of inflammation in obese mice. Concurrent with increased capsase-1 activation in vivo, we detected stronger biosensor signal in white adipose and heart tissues of obese mice ex vivo and observed that a short-term butyrate treatment affected some, but not all, of the inflammatory responses induced by Western diet. Through characterization of inflammatory responses and computational analyses, we identified tissue- and sex-specific caspase-1 activation patterns and inflammatory phenotypes in obese mice, offering new mechanistic insights underlying the dynamics of inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Western diet style (fast food), which includes fatty frozen junk food, lard, processed meats, whole-fat dairy foods, cream, mayonnaise, butter, snacks, and fructose, is a primary etiological determinant for developing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) worldwide. Here the primary focus is to see the impact of naturally identified essential oil on disease mechanisms developed in an animal model using the same ingredients. Currently, symptomatic therapies are recommended for the management of NASH due to non-availability of specific treatments. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the potential anti-NASH effect of nerolidol in a rat model fed with a purpose-built diet. The diet substantially induced insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and elevation of liver enzymes in the experimental animals. The levels of liver oxidative stress markers, nitrites (NO2-), serum pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) and hepatic collagen were increased in disease control rats. Nerolidol oral treatment in ascending dose order of 250 and 500 mg/kg substantially reduced the steatosis (macrovesicular and microvesicular), degeneration of hepatocytes, and inflammatory cells infiltration. The amounts of circulatory TNF-α and tissue collagen were also reduced at 500 mg/kg dose of nerolidol, expressing its anti-fibrotic effect. The current study described the multiple-hit pathophysiology of NASH as enhanced steatosis, pro-inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress in rats, which resulted in the development of vicious insulin resistance. Nerolidol treatment significantly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation and halted disease progression induced by a hypercaloric diet.",

Accumulating evidence has indicated that regulating intestinal integrity and the gut microbiota may be new treatment strategies for metabolic inflammation and obesity. Cordycepin has been reported to improve obesity, but the mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we showed that cordycepin considerably alleviated systemic inflammation while reducing body weight gain and metabolic disorders in Western diet (WD)-fed mice. Further investigations showed that cordycepin significantly ameliorated WD-induced damage to the intestinal barrier and decreased the leakage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the blood in mice by suppressing intestinal inflammation, oxidative stress damage, and decreasing intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and pyroptosis. In addition, by using metagenomic sequencing, we found that cordycepin could also regulate the homeostasis of intestinal flora, including selectively increasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and reducing the production of fecal LPS. Besides, we demonstrated that the intestinal flora partially mediated the beneficial effects of cordycepin on improving intestinal barrier function, and obesity-related symptoms in WD-fed mice by a fecal microbiota transplantation experiment. Hence, our findings provided new insights into the role of cordycepin in improving metabolic inflammation and obesity from the perspective of regulating the intestinal barrier function and intestinal flora, and further provided data support for the utility of cordycepin in the treatment of obesity and its complications.",

Recently, we have shown that LPH treatment reduces liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels in hypercholesterolemic mice. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of LPH treatment on the molecular mechanism underlying liver cholesterol metabolism in ApoE-/- mice fed the Western diet. After identifying the composition of the peptide within the LPH mixture and determining its ability to reduce HMGCoAR activity in vitro, its effect on the LDLR and PCSK9 pathways was measured in liver tissue from the same mice. Thus, the LPH reduced the protein levels of HMGCoAR and increased the phosphorylated inactive form of HMGCoAR and the pHMGCoAR/HMGCoAR ratio, which led to the deactivation of de novo cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, the LPH decreased the protein levels of SREBP2, a key upstream transcription factor involved in the expression of HMGCoAR and LDLR. Consequently, LDLR protein levels decreased in the liver of LPH-treated animals. Interestingly, the LPH also increased the protein levels of pAMPK responsible for HMGCoAR phosphorylation. Furthermore, the LPH controlled the PSCK9 signal pathway by decreasing its transcription factor, the HNF1-α protein. Consequently, lower PSCK9 protein levels were found in the liver of LPH-treated mice. This is the first study elucidating the molecular mechanism at the basis of the hypocholesterolemic effects exerted by the LPH in an in vivo model. All these findings point out LPHs as a future lipid-lowering ingredient to develop new functional foods.",

      "abstract": "A two-way connection between obesity and lymphatic dysfunction has now been established. Clinical studies have demonstrated that obesity significantly increases the risk for developing secondary lymphedema. Using animal-models, obesity and metabolic syndrome have been linked to different aspects of lymphatic structural abnormalities and lymphatic dysfunction, including impaired contractility, impaired flow-mediated responses, impaired fluid transport, as well as increased permeability, and abnormal dendritic cell migration among others. Dysfunction of lymphatic valves is a main form of lymphatic dysfunction, known to result in severe edematous phenotypes; however, the extent of lymphatic valve deficiency in secondary lymphedema, including obesity-induced lymphedema, remains unknown. Therefore, the aims of the present study were 1) to determine whether western diet-induced obesity results in lymphatic valve dysfunction, and 2) to determine whether lymphatic valve dysfunction in western diet-induced obesity results from the diet itself, or as a consequence of the metabolic alterations induced by the diet. First, we quantitatively assessed and compared valve function in isolated popliteal and mesenteric collecting lymphatic vessels from control and western diet-induced obese C57BL/6J (WT) mice. Feeding a western diet for 14 weeks induced obesity and elevated plasma glucose and cholesterol levels when compared to controls. The function of lymphatic valves in popliteal lymphatics was not affected by diet-induced obesity; however, significant back-leak of pressure was observed in mesenteric lymphatic valves. Dysfunctional, leaky valves from obese animals also required significantly higher adverse pressure to trigger valve closure. Importantly, when subjected to treatment with a western diet, globally deficient PAI-1 mice were significantly protected against metabolic dysfunction and displayed fully functional, competent mesenteric lymphatic valves. In conclusion, our findings show for the first time that, in association with the metabolic alterations induced by the western diet, lymphatic valve dysfunction can be a critical component of obesity-induced lymphedema."

      "abstract": "The hepatic adiponectin and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling pathways play multiple roles in modulating lipid and glucose metabolism, reducing hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, and altering various metabolic targets for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Alisma orientale (AO, Ze xie in Chinese and Taeksa in Korean) is an herbal plant whose tubers are enriched with triterpenoids, which have been reported to exhibit various bioactive properties associated with NAFLD. Here, the present study provides a preclinical evaluation of the biological functions and related signaling pathways of AO extract for the treatment of NAFLD in a Western diet (WD)-induced mouse model. The findings showed that AO extract significantly reversed serum markers (liver function, lipid profile, and glucose) and improved histological features in the liver sections of mice fed WD for 52 weeks. In addition, it also reduced hepatic expression of fibrogenic markers in liver tissue and decreased the extent of collagen-positive areas, as well as inhibited F4/80 macrophage aggregation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. The activation of adiponectin and FXR expression in hepatic tissue may be a major mechanistic signaling cascade supporting the promising role of AO in NAFLD pharmacotherapy. Collectively, our results demonstrated that AO extract improves non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) resolution, particularly with respect to NASH-related fibrosis, along with the regulation of liver enzymes, postprandial hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and weight loss, probably through the modulation of the hepatic adiponectin and FXR pathways.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization determined cardiovascular disease to be the leading cause of death globally; atherosclerosis is the primary cause of the high morbidity and mortality rates. Regular physical activity is an effective strategy for maintaining endothelial health and function to prevent the development of atherosclerosis. Obesity is also a crucial risk factor for atherosclerotic progression in combination with various complications and systemic inflammation. Physiological homeostasis is modulated by the intestinal microbiota, but the mechanisms through which exercise attenuates atherosclerosis through the microbiota have not been elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of endurance exercise on atherosclerosis induced by a Western diet (WD) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout in terms of microbiota parameters and metabolites. Genetically modified ApoE knockout mice (C57BL/6-Apoeem1Narl/Narl, ApoEKO) and wild-type mice (C57BL6/J) were divided into the following four groups (n = 6), namely, wild-type mice fed a chow diet (WT CD), ApoEKO mice fed a chow diet (ApoE CD), ApoEKO mice fed a WD (ApoE WD), and ApoEKO mice fed a WD and performing endurance exercise (ApoE WD EX), for a 12-week intervention. The WD significantly induced obesity and atherosclerotic syndrome in the ApoE WD group. Severe atherosclerotic lesions and arterial thickness were significantly elevated and accompanied by increases in VCAM-1, MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-1β for immune cell chemotaxis and inflammation during atherosclerotic pathogenesis in the ApoE WD group. In addition, dysbiosis in the ApoE WD group resulted in the lowest short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Endurance exercise intervention (ApoE WD EX) significantly alleviated atherosclerotic syndrome by reducing obesity, significantly inhibiting VCAM-1, MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression, and increasing the production of SCFAs. Modulation of the microbiota associated with inflammation, such as Desulfovibrio, Tyzzerella, and Lachnospiraceae_ge, and increased SCFA production, particularly through an abundance of Rikenellaceae and Dubosiella, were also observed after exercise intervention. Endurance exercise can alleviate WD-induced atherosclerosis through the amelioration of obesity, inflammation, and chemotaxis signaling, which are modulated by the microbiota and derived SCFAs.",

Moreover, probiotic supplementation and antibiotic treatment reduce diet-induced hepatic inflammation. The current study examines whether shaping the gut microbes by Bifidobacterium infantis (B. infantis) supplementation and antibiotic treatment reduce diet-induced brain inflammation and improve neuroplasticity. Furthermore, the significance of bile acid (BA) signaling in regulating brain inflammation was studied. Mice were fed a control diet (CD) or WD for seven months. B. infantis was supplemented to WD-fed mice to study brain inflammation, lipid, metabolomes, and neuroplasticity measured by long-term potentiation (LTP). Broad-spectrum coverage antibiotics and cholestyramine treatments were performed to study the impact of WD-associated gut microbes and BA in brain inflammation. Probiotic B. infantis supplementation inhibited diet-induced brain inflammation by reducing IL6, TNFα, and CD11b levels. B. infantis improved LTP and increased brain PSD95 and BDNF levels, which were reduced due to WD intake. Additionally, B. infantis reduced cecal cholesterol, brain ceramide and enhanced saturated fatty acids. Moreover, antibiotic treatment, as well as cholestyramine, diminished WD-induced brain inflammatory signaling. Our findings support the theory that intestinal microbiota remodeling by B. infantis reduces brain inflammation, activates BA receptor signaling, and improves neuroplasticity.",

Emerging evidence suggests that anthocyanin-rich foods such as US Montmorency tart cherry (TC) can promote health by influencing the gut microbiota and maintaining gut integrity. This study investigated the effects of TC supplementation on the gut microbiota, markers of gut health, and metabolic parameters in mice fed a western diet (WD). Seventy-two C57BL/6 male mice were assigned to dietary treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial design with diet (control, WD) and TC (0, 5, 10% wt/wt) as factors. After 12 weeks of dietary treatment, tissues were collected to evaluate metabolic parameters and markers of gut health including cecal content microbiota and fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). TC supplementation significantly increased the bacterial phylum, Actinobacteria, cecal weight, and fecal SCFAs and reduced the Proteobacteria and Deferribacteres phyla. However, gut histological parameters and expression of genes related to gut integrity were unaffected by TC. Body weight, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and resistin were increased with WD and TC had no effect on these parameters. Fasting blood glucose and the surrogate marker of insulin resistance, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), was significantly increased by WD which was improved by TC particularly the 5% dose. In conclusion, TC supplementation, particularly the 5% dose, improved markers of glucose homeostasis but has modest effects on gut microbial population and SCFAs production. The mechanism by which TC improved markers of glucose homeostasis needs to be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "Background: Asparaginases are common chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a single or combinational therapy. Accompanying hepatotoxicity makes its use in elderly patients with pre-conditions, as obesity or other hepatopathies, difficult. Various hepatoprotective compounds like, L-carnitine, are discussed to ameliorate the induced hepatotoxicity. Methods: Here we aimed to establish a mouse model to study the effect of asparaginases (L-asparaginase and Oncaspar) and L-carnitine on Western-diet-induced hepatosteatosis in mice. Dose-escalation studies were performed to analyze asparaginases induced hepatotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice with normal or fatty livers. Subsequently, the effect of L-carnitine to improve the induced toxicity was tested. Results: Our results showed mild-to-moderate hepatotoxic effects while the Western-diet induced a higher degree of vacuolization and hepatocyte damage in liver tissue. Testing of L-carnitine in the established models did not show any protective effect on the toxicity or impairment of the efficacy of asparaginases. Conclusion: The here established models were able to demonstrate the asparaginase-induced hepatotoxic effects which were enhanced by the Western-diet. However, to test potential ameliorating drugs, the models might need some improvements.",

      "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a nutrient-sensitive cellular signaling kinase that has been implicated in the excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NADPH oxidase-derived ROS have been implicated in erectile dysfunction pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to determine if mTOR is an activator of NADPH oxidase in the penis and to determine the functional relevance of this pathway in a translationally relevant model of diet-induced erectile dysfunction. Male mice were fed a control diet or a high-fat, high-sucrose Western style diet (WD) for 12 weeks and treated with vehicle or rapamycin for the final 4 weeks of the dietary intervention. Following the intervention, erectile function was assessed by cavernous nerve-stimulated intracavernous pressure measurement, in vivo ROS production was measured in the penis using a microdialysis approach, and relative protein contents from the corpus cavernosum were determined by Western blot. Erectile function was impaired in vehicle treated WD-mice and was preserved in rapamycin treated WD-mice. Penile NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS were elevated in WD-mice and suppressed by rapamycin treatment. Western blot analysis suggests mTOR activation with WD by increased active site phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K, and increased expression of NADPH oxidase subunits, all of which were suppressed by rapamycin. These data suggest that mTOR is an upstream mediator of NADPH oxidase in the corpus cavernosum in response to a chronic Western diet, which has an adverse effect on erectile function."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the pathogenesis of central nervous system disorders (e.g., neurodegenerative), an important role is attributed to an unhealthy lifestyle affecting brain energy metabolism. Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of lifestyle-related diseases is getting increasing attention. METHODS: We performed a series of assessments in adult female Long Evans rats subjected to 6 weeks of Western diet feeding and wheel-running training. A control group of lean rats was fed with a standard diet. In all experimental groups, we measured physiological parameters (animal weights, body composition, serum metabolic parameters). We assessed the impact of simultaneous exposure to a Western diet and wheel-running on the cerebrocortical protein expression (global proteomic profiling), and in the second part of the experiment, we measured the cortical levels of protein related to brain metabolism (Western blot). RESULTS: Western diet led to an obese phenotype and induced changes in the serum metabolic parameters. Wheel-running did not reduce animal weights or fat mass but significantly decreased serum glucose level. The global proteome analysis revealed that the altered proteins were functionally annotated as they were involved mostly in metabolic pathways. Western blot analysis showed the downregulation of the mitochondrial protein-Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 9, hexokinase 1 (HK1)-enzyme involved in principal glucose metabolism pathways and monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2). Wheel-running reversed this decline in the cortical levels of HK1 and MCT2. CONCLUSION: The cerebrocortical proteome is affected by a combination of physical activity and Western diet in female rats. An analysis of the cortical proteins involved in brain energy metabolism provides a valuable basis for the deeper investigation of changes in the brain structure and function induced by simultaneous exposure to a Western diet and physical activity.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of diets high in fat, sugar, and salt (Western diet, WD) is associated with accelerated arterial stiffening, a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Women with obesity are more prone to develop arterial stiffening leading to more frequent and severe CVD compared with men. As tissue transglutaminase (TG2) has been implicated in vascular stiffening, our goal herein was to determine the efficacy of cystamine, a nonspecific TG2 inhibitor, at reducing vascular stiffness in female mice chronically fed a WD. Three experimental groups of female mice were created. One was fed regular chow diet (CD) for 43 wk starting at 4 wk of age. The second was fed a WD for the same 43 wk, whereas a third cohort was fed WD, but also received cystamine (216 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water during the last 8 wk on the diet (WD + C). All vascular stiffness parameters assessed, including aortic pulse wave velocity and the incremental modulus of elasticity of isolated femoral and mesenteric arteries, were significantly increased in WD- versus CD-fed mice, and reduced in WD + C versus WD-fed mice. These changes coincided with respectively augmented and diminished vascular wall collagen and F-actin content, with no associated effect in blood pressure. In cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells, cystamine reduced TG2 activity, F-actin:G-actin ratio, collagen compaction capacity, and cellular stiffness. We conclude that cystamine treatment represents an effective approach to reduce vascular stiffness in female mice in the setting of WD consumption, likely because of its TG2 inhibitory capacity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study evaluates the novel role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) inhibition to directly treat vascular stiffness. Our data demonstrate that cystamine, a nonspecific TG2 inhibitor, improves vascular stiffness induced by a diet rich in fat, fructose, and salt. This research suggests that TG2 inhibition might bear therapeutic potential to reduce the disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease in females in conditions of chronic overnutrition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A Western diet (WD) is associated with increased inflammation in the large intestine, which is often ascribed to the high dietary fat content. Intestinal inflammation in rodents can be induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). However, most studies investigating effects of WD and DSS have not used appropriate low-fat diets (LFDs) as control. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of a WD with those of an LFD on colon health in a DSS-induced low-grade colonic inflammation mouse model. METHODS: Six-week-old male C57BL/6JRj mice were fed an LFD (fat = 10.3% energy, n = 24) or a WD (fat = 41.2% energy, n = 24) for 15 wk [Experiment 1 (Exp.1)]. Half the mice on each diet (n = 12) then received 1% DSS in water for 6 d with the remainder (n = 12 in each diet) administered water. Disease activity, proinflammatory genes, inflammatory biomarkers, and fecal microbiota (16S rRNA) were assessed (Exp.1). Follow-up experiments (Exp.2 and Exp.3) were performed to investigate whether fat source (milk or lard; Exp.2) affected outcomes and whether a shift from LFD to WD 1 d prior to 1% DSS exposure caused an immediate effect on DSS-induced inflammation (Exp.3). RESULTS: In Exp.1, 1% DSS treatment significantly increased disease score in the LFD group compared with the WD group (2.7 compared with 0.8; P < 0.001). Higher concentrations of fecal lipocalin (11-fold; P < 0.001), proinflammatory gene expression (≤82-fold), and Proteobacteria were observed in LFD-fed mice compared with the WD group. The 2 fat sources in WDs (Exp.2) revealed the same low inflammation in WD+DSS mice compared with LFD+DSS mice. Finally, the switch from LFD to WD just before DSS exposure resulted in reduced colonic inflammation (Exp.3). CONCLUSIONS: Herein, WDs (with milk or lard) protected mice against DSS-induced colonic inflammation compared with LFD-fed mice. Whether fat intake induces protective mechanisms against DSS-mediated inflammation or inhibits establishment of the DSS-induced colitis model is unclear.",

The aim of this study was to assess the combined influences of diet-induced obesity and psychological stress on microbiome composition and colonic gene expression. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice (n = 48) were subject to a combination of 22 weeks of Western diet (WD) feeding and a chronic restraint stressor (CRS) for the last 4 weeks of feeding. At the end of the combined intervention, microbiome composition was determined from cecal contents, and colonic tissue gene expression was assessed by multiplex analysis using NanoString nCounter System and real-time qPCR. RESULTS: WD feeding induced a DIO phenotype with increased body weight, worsened metabolic markers, and alterations to microbiome composition. CRS reduced body weight in both dietary groups while having differential effects on glucose metabolism. CRS improved the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in WD-fed animals while expanding the Proteobacteria phyla. Significantly lower expression of colonic Tlr4 (p = 0.008), Ocln (p = 0.004), and Cldn3 (p = 0.004) were noted in WD-fed animals compared to controls with no synergistic effects observed when combined with CRS. No changes to colonic expression of downstream inflammatory mediators were observed. Interestingly, higher levels of expression of Cldn2 (p = 0.04) and bile acid receptor Nr1h4 (p = 0.02) were seen in mice exposed to CRS. CONCLUSION: Differential but not synergistic effects of WD and CRS were noted at the host-microbe interface suggesting multifactorial responses that require further investigation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterised by accumulation of triglycerides and cholesterol within the liver and dysregulation of specific hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYPs) activity. CYPs are involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous chemicals. Hepatic CYP activity is dysregulated in human studies and animal models of a Western diet (WD) or low birth weight (LBW) independently, but the additive effects of LBW and postnatal WD consumption are unknown. As such, the aim of this study was to determine the independent and combined effect of birthweight and postnatal diet on hepatic CYP activity in a guinea pig model. METHODS: LBW was generated via uterine artery ablation at mid gestation (term = 70 days gestation). Normal birthweight (NBW) and LBW pups were allocated either a control diet (CD) or WD at weaning. After 4 months of dietary intervention, guinea pigs were humanely killed, and liver tissue collected for biochemical and functional hepatic CYP activity analyses. RESULTS: Independent of birthweight, functional activity of CYP3A was significantly reduced in female and male WD compared to CD animals (female, P < 0.0001; male, P = 0.004). Likewise, CYP1A2 activity was significantly reduced in male WD compared to CD animals (P = 0.020) but this same reduction was not observed in females. CONCLUSION: Diet, but not birthweight, significantly altered hepatic CYP activity in both sexes, and the effect of diet appeared to be greater in males. These findings may have clinical implications for the management of NAFLD and associated co-morbidities between the sexes.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis and NAFLD are the leading causes of death worldwide. The hallmark of NAFLD is triglyceride accumulation caused by an imbalance between lipogenesis de novo and fatty acid oxidation. Agmatine, an endogenous metabolite of arginine, exerts a protective effect on mitochondria and can modulate fatty acid metabolism. In the present study, we investigate the influence of agmatine on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and the development of hepatic steatosis in apoE-/- mice fed with a Western high-fat diet, with a particular focus on its effects on the DNL pathway in the liver. We have proved that treatment of agmatine inhibits the progression of atherosclerosis and attenuates hepatic steatosis in apoE-/- mice on a Western diet. Such effects are associated with decreased total macrophage content in atherosclerotic plaque as well as a decrease in the TG levels and the TG/HDL ratio in plasma. Agmatine also reduced TG accumulation in the liver and decreased the expression of hepatic genes and proteins involved in lipogenesis de novo such as SREBP-1c, FASN and SCD1. In conclusion, agmatine may present therapeutic potential for the treatment of atherosclerosis and fatty liver disease. However, an exact understanding of the mechanisms of the advantageous actions of agmatine requires further study.",

NAFLD development and progression is associated with an increase in hepatic cholesterol levels and decreased autophagy and lipophagy flux. Previous studies have shown that the expression of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), encoded by the gene LIPA, which can hydrolyze both triglyceride and cholesteryl esters, is inversely correlated with the severity of NAFLD. In addition, ablation of LAL activity results in profound NAFLD. Based on this, we predicted that overexpressing LIPA in the livers of mice fed a Western diet would prevent the development of NAFLD. As expected, mice fed the Western diet exhibited numerous markers of NAFLD, including hepatomegaly, lipid accumulation, and inflammation. Unexpectedly, LAL overexpression did not attenuate steatosis and had only minor effects on neutral lipid composition. However, LAL overexpression exacerbated inflammatory gene expression and infiltration of immune cells in mice fed the Western diet. LAL overexpression also resulted in abnormal phagosome accumulation and lysosomal lipid accumulation depending upon the dietary treatment. Overall, we found that hepatic overexpression of LAL drove immune cell infiltration and inflammation and did not attenuate the development of NAFLD, suggesting that targeting LAL expression may not be a viable route to treat NAFLD in humans.",

In a subsequent experiment, these outcomes were evaluated following a 5-week dietary intervention where CAF and SUG groups were maintained on standard chow alone. RESULTS: Both CAF and SUG groups demonstrated impaired HPC-dependent memory, increased adiposity, and altered gut microbial populations relative to the CHOW group. However, impaired peripheral glucose regulation was only observed in the SUG group. When examined following a healthy dietary intervention in a separate experiment, metabolic dysfunction was not observed in either the CAF or SUG group, whereas HPC-dependent memory impairments were observed in the CAF but not the SUG group. In both groups the composition of the gut microbiota remained distinct from CHOW rats after the dietary intervention. CONCLUSIONS: While the metabolic impairments associated with adolescent junk food diet consumption are not present in adulthood following dietary intervention, the HPC-dependent memory impairments and the gut microbiome dysbiosis persist.",

We also explored the effect of Metformin treatment on these mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed with HFSS and treated with metformin from 20 to 22 months of age, resembling human aging from 56 to 68 years of age (an entry phase of the aged portion of lifespan). RESULTS: The motor and sensory cortexes in mice during aging after HFSS diet showed: (A) decreased motor-muscular and sensory functions; (B) reduced inflammation-resolving Arg-1+ microglia; (C) increased inflammatory iNOs+ microglia and TNFα levels; (D) enhanced abundance of amyloid-β peptide and of phosphorylated Tau. Metformin attenuated these changes. CONCLUSION: A HFSS-combined diet caused motor-muscular and sensory dysfunctions, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, whereas metformin counteracted these effects. Our findings show neuroinflammatory consequences of a HFSS diet in aging. Metformin curbs the HFSS-related neuroinflammation eliciting neuroprotection.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Cesalpineaceae) is a medium tree found in the Xingó region (semi-arid area) in Northeast of Brazil, recognised by local population as an antidiabetic agent. According information from local community, the commonly traditional preparation is prepared as an infusion of the aerial part of the plant and consumed over the day to manage diabetes-related complications. Previous studies have described Parkinsonia aculeate as a product with both hypoglycemic and hypotriglyceridemic effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of polar fraction obtained from the hydroethanolic extract of Parkinsonia aculeata (PfrHEPA) on the lipid profile of animals that consumed a westernized diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six Wistar rats (45-55 g) were fed either with standard control(C) or westernized diet(W) for 120 days. The food intake, body weight evolution and body size were also analyzed. From 120 to 150 days, they were orally treated according to their group with vehicle (distillated water, 10 mL/kg), PfrHEPA at three doses (35, 70 and 140 mg/kg/day) or Gemfibrozil (140 mg/kg/day) for 30 days. RESULTS: The animals fed with westernized diet showed dyslipidemia when compared to animals receiving a standard diet. Treatment with PfrHEPA (140 mg/kg), even with the continued consumption of westernized diet by animals (from 120 to 150 days) promoted a significant reduction in total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels, in relation to untreated W group. PfrHEPA 140 mg/kg reduced the key serum lipids and glycaemia as well as inflammatory cytokines known as important risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The observed evidence may contribute to the control of metabolic parameters as dyslipidemia corroborating the ethnopharmacological information concerning the antihyperlipidemic and hypoglycemic activities of P. aculeata.",

This study investigated the effect of WDs on the development and progression of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) and the efficacy of the anti-obesity agent orlistat on WD-driven CAC in mice. The results revealed that the WD exacerbated CAC in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice, which showed increased mortality, tumor formation, and aggravation of tumor progression. Furthermore, WD feeding also upregulated inflammation, hyperplasia, and tumorigenicity levels through the activation of STAT3 and NF-κB signaling in an AOM/DSS-induced mouse model. In contrast, treatment with orlistat increased the survival rate and alleviated the symptoms of CAC, including a recovery in colon length and tumor production decreases in WD-driven AOM/DSS-induced mice. Additionally, orlistat inhibited the extent of inflammation, hyperplasia, and tumor progression via the inhibition of STAT3 and NF-κB activation. Treatment with orlistat also suppressed the β-catenin, slug, XIAP, Cdk4, cyclin D, and Bcl-2 protein levels in WD-driven AOM/DSS-induced mice. The results of this study indicate that orlistat alleviates colon cancer promotion in WD-driven CAC mice by suppressing inflammation, especially by inhibiting STAT3 and NF-κB activation.",

The aim of our study was to investigate whether BG from highland barley has an effect on western diet-induced NAFLD in mice. Using lipidomics, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of BG intervention, and identified potential lipid biomarkers. The results reveal that BG (300 mg/kg body weight) significantly alleviated liver steatosis. Lipidomics analysis demonstrated that BG also altered lipid metabolic patterns. We were able to identify 13 differentially regulated lipid species that may be useful as lipid biomarkers. Several genes in the hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism pathways were also modulated. These findings provide evidence that BG ameliorates NAFLD by altering liver lipid metabolites and regulating lipid metabolism-related genes.",

METHODS: Eighty-seven participants (age range: 45 to 65) with normal cognition (NC, n = 56) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 31) received isocaloric diets high or low in saturated fat, glycemic index, and sodium (Western-like/West-diet vs. Mediterranean-like/Med-diet) for 4 weeks. Diet effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, cognition, and cerebral perfusion were assessed to determine whether responses differed by cognitive status. RESULTS: CSF amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 ratios increased following the Med-diet, and decreased after West-diet for NC adults, whereas the MCI group showed the reverse pattern. For the MCI group, the West-diet reduced and the Med-diet increased total tau (t-tau), whereas CSF Aβ42 /t-tau ratios increased following the West-diet and decreased following the Med-diet. For NC participants, the Med-diet increased and the West-diet decreased cerebral perfusion.

In the present study, we investigated whether early treatment with a single dose of IL-1β blocking antibodies could prevent Western diet (WD) induced changes to systemic monocyte populations and their cytokine secretion profile and herewith modulate collagenase induced osteoarthritis (CiOA) pathology. METHODS: CiOA was induced in female C57Bl/6 mice fed either a standard diet (SD) or WD and treated with a single dose of either polyclonal anti-IL-1β antibodies or control. Monocyte subsets and granulocytes in bone marrow and blood were analyzed with flow cytometry, and cytokine expression by bone marrow cells was analyzed using qPCR. Synovial cellularity, cartilage damage and osteophyte formation were assessed on histology. RESULTS: WD feeding of C57Bl/6 mice led to increased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and innate immune activation in the form of an increased number of Ly6Chigh cells in bone marrow and blood and increased cytokine expression of IL-6 and TNF-α by bone marrow cells. The increase in monocyte number and activity was ameliorated by anti-IL-1β treatment. However, anti-IL-1β treatment did not significantly affect synovial lining thickness, cartilage damage and ectopic bone formation during WD feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose systemic anti-IL-1β treatment prevented WD-induced innate immune activation during early stage CiOA in C57Bl/6 mice, but did not ameliorate joint pathology.",

Methods: Thirty female Wistar rats were equally divided into two groups and fed either control diet or Western diet. After eight weeks, obese rats (fed Western diet) were divided into three groups (n=5); obese control received the vehicle, while the other two received lycopene (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg body weight, respectively). Normal rats were grouped into three (n=5) and treated similarly. This treatment lasted for another two weeks, in addition to their respective diets. Afterwards, anthropometrical indices were taken. Results: The weight gain, adiposity index, abdominal and thoracic circumference, body mass index, and Lee index were significantly increased (p<0.05) in the obese rats compared to the normal control, by 108.3%, 102.1%, 81.5%, 97.6%, 47.4%, and 13.9%, respectively. The obese rats had significantly (p<0.05) higher adipose tissue lipid contents, daily feed (37.4%) and energy intake (66.0%), daily weight gain (108.3%), and feed efficiency (25.5%) compared to control. However, the treatment of obese rats with lycopene occasioned a dose-dependent reduction in the elevated anthropometrical and nutritional parameters. In addition, lycopene elicited significant reductions (p<0.05), ranging from 16-54%, in the adipose lipid contents. Conclusion: The data presented here illustrate the positive effects of lycopene on indices of obesity and other anthropometric parameters in obese female rats.",

However, drugs to treat NAFLD and NASH are an unmet clinical need. This study sought to provide evidence that Cisd2 is a molecular target for the development of treatments targeting NAFLD and NASH. Several discoveries are pinpointed. The first is that Cisd2 dosage modulates the severity of Western diet-induced (WD-induced) NAFLD. Specifically, Cisd2 haploinsufficiency accelerates NAFLD development and exacerbates progression toward NASH. Conversely, an enhanced Cisd2 copy number attenuates liver pathogenesis. Secondly, when a WD is fed to mice, transcriptomic analysis reveals that the major alterations affecting biological processes are related to inflammation, lipid metabolism, and DNA replication/repair. Thirdly, among these differentially expressed genes, the most significant changes involve Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress, cholesterol biosynthesis, and fatty acid metabolism. Finally, increased Cisd2 expression protects the liver from oxidative stress and reduces the occurrence of mitochondrial DNA deletions. Taken together, our mouse model reveals that Cisd2 plays a crucial role in protecting the liver from WD-induced damages. The development of therapeutic agents that effectively enhance Cisd2 expression is one potential approach to the treatment of WD-induced fatty liver diseases."

Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a cardinal hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), may accelerate the progression of pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, diet-induced obese (DIO) mice exposed to CIH have not been perceived as a fast or reliable tool in NASH research. This study was designed to establish a rapid juvenile murine NASH model, and determine whether the combination of CIH and a western-style diet (hypercaloric fatty diet plus high fructose) can fully display key pathologic features of NASH. METHODS: C57BL/6 N mice (3 weeks old) fed a control diet or western diet (WD) were exposed to CIH (9% nadir of inspired oxygen levels) or room air for 6 and 12 weeks. KEY FINDINGS: The Control/CIH group mainly exhibited hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (IR). In contrast, mice fed a WD developed weight gain after 3 weeks, microvesicular steatosis in 6 weeks, and indices of metabolic disorders at 12 weeks. Furthermore, CIH exposure accelerated WD- induced macromicrovesicular steatosis (liver triglycerides and de novo lipogenesis), liver injury (ballooned hepatocytes and liver enzymes), lobular/portal inflammation (inflammatory cytokines and macrophage recruitment), and fibrogenesis (hydroxyproline content and TGF-β protein). Notably, only the WD/CIH group exhibited elevated hepatic MDA content, protein levels of NOX4, α-SMA and collagen I, as well as reduced Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression. SIGNIFICANCE: WD/CIH treatment rapidly mimics the histological characteristics of pediatric NASH with metabolic dysfunction and fibrosis, representing an appropriate experimental model for NASH research.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Highly prevalent diseases such as insulin resistance and heart failure are characterized by reduced metabolic flexibility and reserve. We tested whether Na/K-ATPase (NKA)-mediated regulation of Src kinase, which requires two NKA sequences specific to the α1 isoform, is a regulator of metabolic capacity that can be targeted pharmacologically. METHODS: Metabolic capacity was challenged functionally by Seahorse metabolic flux analyses and glucose deprivation in LLC-PK1-derived cells expressing Src binding rat NKA α1, non-Src-binding rat NKA α2 (the most abundant NKA isoform in the skeletal muscle), and Src binding gain-of-function mutant rat NKA α2. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific ablation of NKA α1 (skα1-/-) were generated using a MyoD:Cre-Lox approach and were subjected to treadmill testing and Western diet. C57/Bl6 mice were subjected to Western diet with or without pharmacological inhibition of NKA α1/Src modulation by treatment with pNaKtide, a cell-permeable peptide designed by mapping one of the sites of NKA α1/Src interaction. RESULTS: Metabolic studies in mutant cell lines revealed that the Src binding regions of NKA α1 are required to maintain metabolic reserve and flexibility. Skα1-/- mice had decreased exercise endurance and mitochondrial Complex I dysfunction. However, skα1-/- mice were resistant to Western diet-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, a protection phenocopied by pharmacological inhibition of NKA α1-mediated Src regulation with pNaKtide. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that NKA α1/Src regulatory function may be targeted in metabolic diseases. Because Src regulatory capability by NKA α1 is exclusive to endotherms, it may link the aerobic scope hypothesis of endothermy evolution to metabolic dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Exercise behavior is under partial genetic control, but it is also affected by numerous environmental factors, potentially including early-life experiences whose effects persist into adulthood. We studied genetic and early-life environmental effects on wheel-running behavior in a mouse model that includes four replicate high runner (HR) lines selectively bred for increased voluntary wheel running as young adults and four non-selected control (C) lines. In a full factorial design, mice from each line were granted wheel access or not and administered either standard or Western diet (WD) from weaning (3 weeks old) to 6 weeks of age (sexual maturity). In addition to acute effects, after a washout period of 8 weeks (∼6 human years) in which all mice had standard diet and no wheel access, we found both beneficial and detrimental effects of these early-life exposures. During the first week of treatments, WD increased distance run by 29% in C mice and 48% in HR mice (significant Diet × Linetype interaction), but diet effects disappeared by the third week. Across the three weeks of juvenile treatment, WD significantly increased fat mass (with lean mass as a covariate). Tested as adults, early-life exercise increased wheel running of C mice but not HR mice in the first week. Early-life exercise also reduced adult anxiety-like behavior and increased adult fasted blood glucose levels, triceps surae mass, subdermal fat pad mass, and brain mass, but decreased heart ventricle mass. Using fat mass as a covariate, early-life exercise treatment increased adult leptin concentration. In contrast, early-life WD increased adult wheel running of HR mice but not C mice. Early-life WD also increased adult lean mass and adult preference for Western diet in all groups. Surprisingly, early-life treatment had no significant effect on adult body fat or maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max). No previous study has tested for combined or interactive effects of early-life WD and exercise. Our results demonstrate that both factors can have long-lasting effects on adult voluntary exercise and related phenotypes, and that these effects are modulated by genetic background. Overall, the long-lasting effects of early-life exercise were more pervasive than those of WD, suggesting critical opportunities for health intervention in childhood habits, as well as possible threats from modern challenges. These results may be relevant for understanding potential effects of activity reductions and dietary changes associated with the obesity epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "abstract": "The etiology of reproductive disorders correlates with weight gain in patients, but the link between reproduction, diet, and weight has been difficult to translate in rodents. As rates of childhood obesity and reproductive disorders increase, the need to study the effects of weight and diet on adolescent females is key. Previous studies show that female mice are resistant to high-fat diet-induced weight gain, but the mechanisms are unclear. Literature also suggests that ovarian function is essential to resistance in weight gain, as an ovariectomy leads to a weight-gaining phenotype similar to male mice on a high-fat diet. However, reproductive changes that occur in adolescent mice on high-fat diet have not been assessed. Here, we show that regulation of the estrus cycle via progesterone is critical to metabolic homeostasis in female mice on a high-fat diet. Female mice were put on high-fat diet or control diet for 12 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age. Every 4 weeks, their estrus cycle was tracked and fasting glucose was measured. We found that after 4 weeks on high-fat diet, there was no difference in weight between groups, but an increase in time spent in proestrus and estrus in mice on high-fat diet and an increase in serum progesterone during proestrus. These results show that intact females modulate their estrus cycle in response to a high-fat diet as a mechanism of homeostatic regulation of body weight, protecting them from metabolic abnormalities. Understanding the mechanisms behind this protection may yield therapeutic opportunities for treatment of reproductive disorders in adolescent female patients."

All of them share the condition of an \"inflammatory disorder\", with impaired immune functions frequently caused or accompanied by alterations in gut microbiota. These multifactorial maladies also have in common malnutrition related to physiopathology. In this context, diet is the greatest modulator of immune system-microbiota crosstalk, and much interest, and new challenges, are arising in the area of precision nutrition as a way towards treatment and prevention. It is a fact that the westernized diet (WD) is partly responsible for the increased prevalence of NCDs, negatively affecting both gut microbiota and the immune system. Conversely, other nutritional approaches, such as Mediterranean diet (MD), positively influence immune system and gut microbiota, and is proposed not only as a potential tool in the clinical management of different disease conditions, but also for prevention and health promotion globally. Thus, the purpose of this review is to determine the regulatory role of nutritional components of WD and MD in the gut microbiota and immune system interplay, in order to understand, and create awareness of, the influence of diet over both key components.",

The symptoms remitted completely with close adherence to the WFPB diet and recurred on multiple occasions associated with poor dietary adherence. There was a self-identified dose-response relationship with degree of adherence and number and intensity of flares. There were no known adverse side effects from the diet change, although the patient felt adherence to be difficult at times. The mechanism is not completely clear; we speculate that the dietary changes directly affect vascular endothelial health, which in turn affects propensity towards a prothrombotic state.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The lifestyle of Inuit in Greenland and worldwide is undergoing a transition from a fisher-hunter to a westernized society and meanwhile the prevalence of type-2 diabetes (T2D) has increased dramatically. Studies have shown that a common nonsense p.Arg684Ter variant in TBC1D4, which is frequent in Greenland, confers genetic susceptibility towards high risk of T2D. The aim of the study is to investigate whether a traditional marine diet, with high fat and low carbohydrate, will improve glycemic control in Greenland Inuit compared to a western diet. Moreover, we want to examine if the response is more pronounced in carriers of the p.Arg684Ter variant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We will conduct a randomized, clinical cross-over trial with two dietary intervention periods of four weeks duration. The diet intervention comprise provision of >20E% and instruction for the remaining part of the diet. We expect to include 30 homozygous carriers and 30 homozygous non-carriers of the p.Arg684Ter variant, aged 18-80 years, across three Greenlandic towns. The primary outcome is plasma (p)-glucose 2 h post an oral glucose tolerance test and we aim to have 80% power, at α = 0.05, to detect a difference of 1.1 mmol/L. We will also include supporting measures of glucose homeostasis, assess other markers of the metabolic syndrome and perform metabolome and microbiome profiling. The statistical analysis will be performed as complete case analyses using linear mixed models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received approval by the Ethics Committee of Greenland (KVUG 2018-26) and will be disseminated via international peer-reviewed journal articles and conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier no. NCT04011904."

In this study, utilizing an IL-23 minicircle-based model with features of both psoriasiform dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis, we showed that intake of WD for 10 weeks predisposed mice not only to skin but also to joint inflammation. Both WD-induced skin and joint injuries were associated with an expansion of IL-17A‒producing γδ T cells and increased expression of T helper type 17 cytokines. After IL-23 minicircle delivery, WD-fed mice had reduced microbial diversity and pronounced dysbiosis. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics suppressed IL-23‒mediated skin and joint inflammation in the WD-fed mice. Strikingly, reduced skin and joint inflammation with a partial reversion of the gut microbiota were noted when mice switched from a WD to a standard diet after IL-23 minicircle delivery. These findings reveal that a short-term WD intake‒induced dysbiosis is accompanied by enhanced psoriasis-like skin and joint inflammation. Modifications toward a healthier dietary pattern should be considered in patients with psoriatic skin and/or joint disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is simple steatosis but can develop into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by liver inflammation, fibrosis, and microvesicular steatosis. Mast cells (MCs) infiltrate the liver during cholestasis and promote ductular reaction (DR), biliary senescence, and liver fibrosis. We aimed to determine the effects of MC depletion during NAFLD/NASH. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Wild-type (WT) and KitW-sh (MC-deficient) mice were fed a control diet (CD) or a Western diet (WD) for 16 weeks; select WT and KitW-sh WD mice received tail vein injections of MCs 2 times per week for 2 weeks prior to sacrifice. Human samples were collected from normal, NAFLD, or NASH mice. Cholangiocytes from WT WD mice and human NASH have increased insulin-like growth factor 1 expression that promotes MC migration/activation. Enhanced MC presence was noted in WT WD mice and human NASH, along with increased DR. WT WD mice had significantly increased steatosis, DR/biliary senescence, inflammation, liver fibrosis, and angiogenesis compared to WT CD mice, which was significantly reduced in KitW-sh WD mice. Loss of MCs prominently reduced microvesicular steatosis in zone 1 hepatocytes. MC injection promoted WD-induced biliary and liver damage and specifically up-regulated microvesicular steatosis in zone 1 hepatocytes. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A3 (ALDH1A3) expression is reduced in WT WD mice and human NASH but increased in KitW-sh WD mice. MicroRNA 144-3 prime (miR-144-3p) expression was increased in WT WD mice and human NASH but reduced in KitW-sh WD mice and was found to target ALDH1A3. CONCLUSIONS: MCs promote WD-induced biliary and liver damage and may promote microvesicular steatosis development during NAFLD progression to NASH through miR-144-3p/ALDH1A3 signaling. Inhibition of MC activation may be a therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH treatment.",

We hypothesized that Yucatan minipigs would show hedonic, cognitive, and affective neuro-behavioral shifts when subjected to western diet (WD) exposure without weight gain, after the onset of obesity, and finally after weight loss induced by caloric restriction with (RYGB) or without (Sham) gastric bypass. Eating behavior, cognitive and affective abilities were assessed with a spatial discrimination task (holeboard test) and two-choice feed tests. Brain responses to oral sucrose were mapped using 18F-FDG positron emission tomography. WD exposure impaired working memory and led to an \"addiction-type\" neuronal pattern involving hippocampal and cortical brain areas. Obesity induced anxiety-like behavior, loss of motivation, and snacking-type eating behavior. Weight loss interventions normalized the motivational and affective states but not eating behavior patterns. Brain glucose metabolism increased in gustatory (insula) and executive control (aPFC) areas after weight loss, but RYGB showed higher responses in inhibition-related areas (dorsal striatum). These results showed that diet quality, weight loss, and the type of weight loss intervention differently impacted brain responses to sucrose in the Yucatan minipig model.",

      "abstract": "In the US, every 12 min, six women are diagnosed with breast cancer and one dies. This highlights a critical need for developing alternate therapies using natural compounds, which are cost effective and with less side effects. Curcumin, the yellow pigment of turmeric has been found to suppress initiation, progression, and metastasis of a variety of tumors. Multiple clinical trials highlight the efficacy of curcumin in treating breast cancer and other diseases. Our in vitro studies have demonstrated that the electrical pulse (EP) application can further enhance the effectiveness of curcumin against breast cancer cells in a therapy called electrochemotherapy (ECT). In a direct extension of these results, we studied the effect of ECT coupled with intratumoral curcumin administration (EP+Cur) on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) induced mammary tumors in female Sprague Dawley rats. Beginning at the weaning and throughout the study, rats were fed either western diet (West) or western diet, supplemented with 1% curcumin (W+Cur). Our results showed that EP+Cur treatment led to a reduced growth rate in rats fed with W+Cur diet compared to West diet (57.14% vs. 16.67% in West diet). These results provide a foundation for further studies towards utilizing it in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a worldwide disease that progresses into steatohepatitis (NASH) that has no current effective treatment. This study aimed, for the first time, to investigate the effect of Dasatinib; a tyrosine kinase inhibitor showing anti-PDGFR activity with a macrophage modulating efficacy, on NASH. METHODS: NASH was induced, in C57BL/6 mice by western diet (WD). Control groups received either DMSO or Dasatinib. After 12 weeks, WD-fed mice received DMSO, Dasatinib (4 mg/kg) or Dasatinib (8 mg/kg) once daily, for four weeks. Serum was examined for ALT and lipid profile. Immunohistochemical staining for SREBP1 (lipogenesis marker), iNOS, arginase-1, CD68, CD163 (macrophage polarization markers), TGF-β (fibrosis marker) and ASMA (a marker for activated hepatic stellate cell), hepatic mRNA expression for SREBP-1, iNOS, arginase-1, TGF-β and PDGFA genes; and western blotting for phosphorylated PDGFR α and β, SREBP1, iNOS, arginase-1, IL1α, COX2, TGF-β and ASMA were performed. Liver sections were stained also for H & E, Oil red O and Sirius red. RESULTS: Dasatinib could ameliorate the WD-induced disturbance of serum ALT, lipid profile and significantly reduced hepatic expression of PDGFA, phosphorylated PDGFR α and β, IL1α, COX2, SREBP-1, iNOS, CD68, TGF-β and ASMA but increased expression for arginase-1 and CD163 (M2 macrophage markers). Moreover, Dasatinib reduced the steatosis, inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, hepatic fibrosis and the high NAFLD activity scoring induced by WD. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib can prevent the progression of WD-induced NASH by attenuating lipogenesis, and inducing M2 macrophage polarization with antifibrotic activity.",
