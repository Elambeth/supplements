      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydroxyapatite (HA) augmentation on the maximum lag screw insertion torque (TMax) using extracted human femoral heads. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hemispherical femoral heads extracted from patients who underwent bipolar hip arthroplasty were used. These samples were divided into the HA treatment group (HA group) and the non-HA treatment group (N group). After drilling, HA was inserted into the femoral heads in the HA group. A lag screw was inserted into the femoral head using a dedicated jig in both groups. The bone mineral density of the uninjured contralateral femoral neck (f-BMD), TMax, and the TMax/f-BMD ratio were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-seven samples were analyzed in this study: 14 samples in the HA group and 13 samples in the N group. No significant differences were observed in f-BMD and TMax between the two groups (HA: 0.49 ± 0.11 vs. N: 0.48 ± 0.092 g/cm2, p = 0.90; HA: 5.6 ± 1.9 vs. N: 4.3 ± 1.9 N･m, p = 0.78). Considering bone mineral density, the HA group showed a significantly higher TMax/f-BMD ratio than the N group (11.7 ± 3.3 vs. 8.9 ± 3.2 N･m･cm2/g, p = 0.036). Correlation coefficients between f-BMD and TMaxin both groups were moderately strong (r = 0.50 vs. 0.50). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HA augmentation improves lag screw fixation strength in the treatment of osteoporotic intertrochanteric femoral fractures."

      "abstract": "The advancement of bone tissue engineering relies on the development of scaffolds that combine structural integrity with bioactivity. This study introduces a novel composite scaffold integrating three-dimensional (3D) printed hydroxyapatite (HA)-wollastonite (WOL) gyroid lattices with chitosan-gelatin cryogels, designed to fulfill these dual requirements. The HA-WOL lattices were fabricated using digital light processing (DLP) 3D-printing and subjected to optimized thermal treatment cycles demonstrating statistically superior compressive modulus and ultimate strength. This thermal process facilitated the phase transformation of HA-WOL to bioactive β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and silicocarnotite mixed phases, with MG63 (osteoblast-like) cell culture revealing significantly enhanced viability and biocompatibility. The chitosan-gelatin polymer network was successfully incorporated into the lattice, resulting in a composite scaffold with retained relative swelling capacity, improved mechanical stability, and superior bioactivity compared to cryogel-only constructs. Additional MG63 cell culture studies revealed that the composite scaffold supported cell viability and proliferation into the constructs, demonstrating its potential to conduct tissue regeneration across bone defects. This work highlights the synergistic effects of integrating bioactive ceramics with polymer-based cryogels, offering a promising solution to address bone regeneration in orthopaedic reconstruction. Future research will focus on in vivo validation and optimization of scaffold architecture to further enhance clinical relevance. This study paves the way for next-generation composite scaffolds capable of bridging the gap between mechanical integrity and biological performance in bone regeneration."

      "abstract": "The treatment of bone defects is complicated by clinical conditions, such as trauma, tumor resection, and infection, which result in defects and impair the bone's regenerative capacity. Hydroxyapatite (HAp), the primary inorganic component of bone, possesses good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. However, it has poor mechanical properties, a slow degradation rate, and limited functionality, necessitating combination with other materials to broaden its application scope. This paper summarizes the importance and properties of HAp composites and provides a categorized review of current research on HAp composites in bone tissue engineering. These composite scaffolds not only offer excellent mechanical support for cell growth and tissue regeneration but also facilitate new bone formation and vascularization. Additionally, the challenges faced by HAp composites, such as material property optimization and improvement of preparation techniques, are discussed. The paper also summarizes the applications of HAp composites in bone defect repair, dental implants, spinal fusion, and other fields."

      "abstract": "The development and production of anti-corrosive coatings are critical for medical implants, particularly those that utilize composite coatings made from both flexible organic materials and rigid inorganic materials, which exhibit advantageous mechanical properties and resistance to corrosion. In this work, an organic composite/hydroxyapatite (HA) coating on magnesium alloys is fabricated through a two-step process, which involves the application of a spray technique for the organic silica composite [polyethyleneimine (PEI)/silica sol (Si)], followed by a hydrothermal treatment to deposit hydroxyapatite. The dense and tight layer-by-layer assembly of the PEI/Si/HA coating on the Mg substrate exhibited a corrosion current density of 10-5.6 A/cm2, significantly lower than that of HA and the Mg substrate. After immersion for 13 days, the PEI/Si/HA coatings demonstrated a minimal amount of H2 generation and negligible fluctuations in pH within the solution. Meanwhile, the hydrothermal PEI/Si/HA coatings exhibited significantly weaker corrosion resistance than the PEI/Si/HA coatings synthesized using the spray method. Both electrochemical dynamic data and structural characteristics demonstrate the enhanced corrosion resistance of organic composite/hydroxyapatite coatings, in which polymer chains provided more volume as a buffer for H2 molecules. This organic composite/hydroxyapatite coating on magnesium alloys exhibited huge potential applications in orthopedics."

      "abstract": "This work developed a Schiff base-chitosan-vanillin/hydroxyapatite (CHI-VAN/HA) composite from natural resources for effective brilliant green (BG) dye removal from aquatic systems. Physicochemical analysis of CHI-VAN/HA was performed via several methods, including BET, XRD, FTIR, and SEM-EDX. The mean pore diameter and total pore volume of CHI-VAN/HA were found to be 4.31 nm and 0.01994 cm3/g, respectively, while the BET surface area was found to be 18.49 m2/g. The CHI-VAN/HA composite mostly exhibits polycrystalline properties, as shown by its average crystallite size of 12.67 nm. Box-Behnken design (BBD) in response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the impacts of the adsorption process parameters, namely the CHI-VAN/HA dosage (A: 0.02-0.08 g/L), pH (B: 4-10), and contact duration (C: 10-40 min). The adsorption process was described using the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-first-order kinetic models. The thermodynamic analysis confirms that the adsorption process is both spontaneous (Gibbs free energy change, ΔG° = -6.832, -7.368, -7.904, and - 8.440 kJ/mol at 298, 308, 318, and 328 K respectively) and endothermic (enthalpy change, ΔH° = 9.156 kJ/mol), with increased interfacial disorder (entropy change, ΔS° = 0.0536 kJ/molK) facilitating the favorable uptake of BG dye onto the CHI-VAN/HA composite. The cost analysis for preparing 1 kg of CHI-VAN/HA adsorbent is approximately $215/kg. The CHI-VAN/HA composite exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 295.74 mg/g for BG dye. Several interactions, including electrostatic, π-π, n-π, H-bonding, and Lewis acid-base interaction, were identified as the mechanism for the BG dye adsorption. This work highlights that the developed Schiff base-chitosan-vanillin/hydroxyapatite composite, derived from natural sources, offers an eco-friendly and sustainable solution for brilliant green dye removal. Its excellent adsorption performance and physicochemical properties underscore its potential application in wastewater treatment and environmental remediation."

This study explored the feasibility of the use of calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA, Radiesse®) as a treatment to improve the biomechanical properties of facial burn scars. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential effects of CaHA injections on the biomechanical properties of facial burn scars and to compare these effects with those of untreated skin. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal feasibility study was conducted with 13 patients who had mature facial scars (2-5 years) covering more than 90% of the face, including hypertrophic, atrophic, and/or keloid scars. The forehead, cheek, and jaw areas were measured before treatment (baseline control) and at 2, 4, and 6 months after CaHA application, resulting in 312 measurements. CaHA was injected subdermally on one side of the face, with the opposite side serving as a control. Biomechanical properties were assessed via a Cutometer MPA 580 alongside clinical assessments, photography, and validated scar scales (Vancouver Scar Scale and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale). RESULTS: Preliminary findings suggest that CaHA injections may improve skin extensibility, elasticity, viscoelasticity, hydration, erythema, and pigmentation in the forehead, cheek, and jaw areas. These observations were supported by visual assessments and scale evaluations. CONCLUSION: This feasibility study indicated that subdermal CaHA injections have potential as a noninvasive approach for improving the biomechanical properties of facial burn scars. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease primarily caused by damage to the articular cartilage. During early OA pathogenesis, chondrocyte mitochondrial dysfunction drives reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, and propagating oxidative damage. Therefore, maintaining a stable pH in the microenvironment and eliminating ROS are crucial for effectively treating OA. In this study, we aim to design a targeted small-molecule delivery system possessing excellent adhesion properties and microenvironment remediation capabilities, addressing the issues of drug degradation and loss in OA treatment. We obtained microspheres (PPC) exhibiting superior cell adhesion through carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) surface modification. Subsequently, quercetin (QUE) was chelated with alendronate-functionalized hydroxyapatite via coordination bonds to obtain (AHQ) nanoparticles. The (PPC-AHQ) microspheres loaded with AHQ nanoparticles exhibit excellent performance in antioxidant and cell adhesion experiments. This study offers valuable insights into OA therapy based on small molecule delivery."

Although it has a favorable safety profile, complications such as nodules, granulomas, and fibrosis can occur. The use of CaHA in the periorbital region remains limited due to safety concerns, and few reports have detailed its complications in this delicate area. We report a case of a 40-year-old patient who developed persistent lower eyelid irregularities and edema following CaHA injection for periorbital rejuvenation. Conservative management, including corticosteroid injections, failed to resolve the complication. Surgical intervention was performed, revealing significant fibrosis and alterations in the orbicularis oculi muscle. A conservative excision was necessary. Histopathologic analysis confirmed granulomatous inflammation. This case highlights the potential risks of CaHA injections in the lower eyelid, emphasizing the need for careful patient selection, precise injection technique, and thorough preprocedural counseling. The complexity of surgical management in this region underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing complications. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term safety and optimal management of CaHA-related complications in the periorbital area."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Radiolabeling of nanoparticles has potential benefits for personalized treatments and theranostic applications, which have been on the agenda in recent years. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANP), which have a great similarity to bone tissue, stand out as a biocompatible nanoparticle. The different biodistribution properties of hydroxyapatite molecules in different nanosizes may create new opportunities for their use, especially in bone imaging and in the treatment of bone tumors. This study aims to investigate the labeling of hydroxyapatite molecules smaller than 50 nanometers obtained from eggshells with technetium-99m (99mTc) and the in vivo distribution of this molecule in rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Characterization of nanohydroxyapatite particles obtained from eggshells was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Radiolabeling of HANP smaller than 50nm with 99mTc radionuclide, stability of the labeled product, and biodistribution profile in rabbits were investigated. RESULTS: The radiochemical purity of the 99mTc-HANP was obtained as 96%. The in vitro stability of 99mTc labeled HANP was examined for up to 12 hours and showed excellent in vitro stability for the first 4 hours in saline. Technetium-99m-HANP remained stable in vivo during the 6-hour imaging period. In quantitative analysis, 99mTc-HANP showed accumulation in bone tissue in the second hour. CONCLUSION: Technetium-99m-HANP nanoradiopharmaceuticals with sizes less than 50 nanometers (20-31nm) showed high uptake in bone tissue in rabbits. Therefore, HANP can be developed as imaging radiopharmaceuticals in bone tissue and bone cancers.",

      "abstract": "Recovering phosphorus from mainstream wastewater treatment systems by leveraging microbial metabolism without the addition of extra chemicals effectively streamlines the steps involved in phosphorus recovery from low-strength wastewater, thereby increasing the economic feasibility of the phosphorus recovery process. Hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca5(PO4)3OH) can be formed directly via bioinduction in biological treatment systems, serving as a potential substitute for phosphate rock. HAP formation in sewage with low phosphate and Ca2+ concentrations is challenging. Denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (DPAOs) can regulate phosphate ions and pH to facilitate HAP formation in sewage. In this study, the denitrifying biological phosphorus removal (DPR) system was established, achieving phosphorus and nitrate removal efficiencies of 99.3 % and 45.1 %, respectively. In the anaerobic and anoxic sections, the saturation index for HAP was greater than zero, indicating favourable conditions for HAP formation. Inorganic cores, identified as HAP through chemical composition and structural features, were formed in the DPR granular sludge, contributing approximately 66 % to phosphorus removal. The HAP‒DPR granular sludge, located at the bottom of the reactor, consisted of 80 wt % inorganic matter and 15.4 wt % total phosphorus, 86.1 % of which was chemical phosphorus precipitation. Microstructural analysis of HAP cores revealed poly-pellet structures with nanoscale wires. The growth of HAP minerals was not inhibited by intracellular polyphosphates. The presence of HAP cores promoted a differentiated spatial distribution of granular sludge and contributed to a differentiated microbial community structure. DPAOs were located mainly in small-sized granular sludge (Type A), whereas denitrifying glycogen-accumulating organisms were found mainly in large-sized granular sludge (Type B), where HAP formation primarily occurred. Granular sludge with higher inorganic and chemical phosphorus contents (Type C) likely originated from the disintegration of Type B. In conclusion, the HAP‒DPR system has potential for phosphorus recovery in the form of HAP directly from low-strength wastewater."

The current research direction of bone tissue engineering microspheres primarily emphasizes composite microspheres. In this context, konjac glucomannan (KGM) has emerged as a promising composite microsphere preparation material for bone tissue engineering due to its exceptional water-absorbing and swelling properties, as well as its high biocompatibility. In order to expand the application of KGM in the field of bone tissue engineering, microspheres were designed and prepared in this paper by using KGM, hydroxyapatite (HA), and sodium alginate (SA). The quaternary amination modification of KGM was carried out to prepare the white flocculated Cationic Konjac Glucomannan (CKGM). CKGM was prepared in an amorphous state, and FT-IR and 1H NMR results proved the successful synthesis of CKGM. The preparation of KGM/SA/HA and CKGM/SA/HA microspheres with rough surfaces involved emulsification, cross-linking, and coating methods. These microspheres exhibited absorption peaks for SA and CKGM. In addition, the XRD diffraction peaks of the two were found to be essentially identical to those of HA. The experimental results demonstrated that the drug release process of both drug-carrying microspheres was pH-responsive, with a direct correlation between the pH level and the cumulative release rate, with lower pH values corresponding to higher release rates. And the cumulative release rate of CKGM/SA/HA@DOX microspheres was slightly lower than that of KGM/SA/HA@DOX microspheres. Secondly, both microspheres had good biocompatibility, thermal stability and bacteriostatic properties.",

      "abstract": "Periodontal bone defect (PBD) treatment involving oral soft and hard tissues is complicated and high requirements for regenerated materials. Besides osteogenic effects, the materials are also required to have the function of barrier soft tissues and promote wound healing. Citrate is reported to promote bone formation through enhanced osteoinductivity and facilitate wound healing by enabling phased angiogenesis. Herein, a novel tri-layered citrate-based hydroxyapatite (Ci-HA) composite scaffold that serves as a bone substitute is developed by \"one-pot\" method for PBD treatment. It is found that Ci-HA degradation products can promote the osteoblastic differentiation of rat bone mesenchymal stem cells and human periodontal ligament stem cells and upregulate angiogenesis-related gene expression in human gingival fibroblasts. Moreover, 3D remodeling in vitro shows that an intermediate layer of tri-layered Ci-HA composite scaffold acts as an optimal barrier. In vivo evaluation of Ci-HA in a rat periodontal intrabony three-wall defect model shows significantly increased bone formation with markedly enhanced osseointegration and better wound healing properties similarly with commercial Bio-Oss bone powder and Bio-Gide membrane. Thus, the novel tri-layered Ci-HA composite scaffold with high biocompatibility may represent a promising biomaterial with multi-effective bone regeneration, barrier effect, and wound healing capacity in the treatment of PBD."

In vitro studies demonstrated that the PB-Er-HAp NPs exhibited significant PTT and PDT effects under 808 nm laser irradiation, effectively inducing cancer cell death through heat generation and reactive oxygen species production, respectively. In vitro experiments validated the ability of NPs to inhibit tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. This study emphasizes the potential of PB-Er-HAp NPs as a versatile platform for synergistic cancer therapy, combining PTT and PDT effects, while offering capabilities for biomedical imaging. Future research aims to further optimize these NPs and explore their clinical application, aiming toward enhanced therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory skin diseases, including dermatitis, are characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory responses that affect approximately 20 % of the global population. Recent therapies primarily focus on inhibition rather than regulating abnormal inflammatory response, which can induce a series of secondary side effects and drug resistance in long-term treatment. In this context, advanced therapy products based on mesenchymal stem cells are promising due to their influence on tissue regeneration. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate skin healing in rats induced to manifest dermatitis and treated with biomaterial composed of hydroxyapatite and chitosan associated or not with conditioned medium from stem cells from the dental pulp. METHODS: One of the primary models to investigate mechanisms of dermatitis involves the application of acetone followed by water. Skin injury was induced on the backs of the animals by rubbing acetone for 5 min for three consecutive days under sedation followed by water. The treatments started on day 3 and lasted 5 days. The experimental groups (n = 5/group) were: induced without treatment (G1), induced and treated with 10 % hydrocortisone ointment (standard treatment, 1×/day) (G2), induced and treated with biomaterial without conditioned medium (G3) and with conditioned medium (G4), applied once as a dressing. On the 8th day post-induction, the animals were euthanized to collect blood and skin fragments for histopathological and immunohistochemical studies and dosages of chemical mediators. RESULTS: Groups G1 and G2 showed rupture and hyperplasia of the epidermis and inflammatory influx. Group G1 presented the highest number of mast cells, mainly degranulated ones. Groups G3 and G4 showed less thickened skin, a better tissue regeneration process, and reduced mast cells. Plasma histamine levels were also reduced in the G4 group. The expression of annexin A1 (AnxA1) and positive cells for Janus kinase (JAK)-1 and JAK-3 presented increased in groups G1 and G2 but reduced in the groups treated with biomaterials, mainly G4. Likewise, the treatments in G3 and G4 lowered levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). CONCLUSION: Treatments with biomaterials especially associated with the conditioned medium reduced the inflammatory process and promoted tissue regeneration in the dermatitis model, demonstrating potential therapeutic application."

      "abstract": "Due to the limited regenerative ability of bone tissue, bone injury repair has always been a complicated problem in clinical treatment. Bone tissue engineering based on cell delivery is an effective method to repair bone defects, but it also puts forward strict requirements on the scaffold used in the repair process and the survival rate of cell inoculation. To address this challenge, we constructed a bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) laden gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel to integrate in silk fibroin (SF) /nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) scaffold, building a dual architecture to achieve enhanced angiogenesis and bone regeneration. The GelMA hydrogel prepared by visible photo-crosslinking showed good cell loading capacity, and the multi-layered-oriented pores of the scaffold provided a suitable microenvironment for cell proliferation and nutrient exchange. We further explored the effects of this \"dual-system\" complex on BMSCs and in a critical-sized rat cranial defect model. The results showed that BMSCs@GelMA-SF/nHAp composite scaffold with directional pore structure was more conducive to the repair of skull defects in rats due to the faster rate of vascularization and osteogenesis, indicating the developed gel-scaffold complex would be a promising therapeutic strategy for the repair of bone defects regeneration.",

      "abstract": "Background: We compared the camouflage effect of three white spot lesion (WSL) treatments (infiltration, nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAP) remineralization, and microabrasion) and color stability of the treated surfaces. Methods: Fifty sound extracted teeth were used in the study. WSLs were created on 40 buccal dento-enamel specimens through the use of acidic methylcellulose gel. These specimens were randomly assigned to treatment groups (n = 10 per group): negative controls, nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAP), resin infiltration, and microabrasion. After the treatment, all 50 specimens were immersed in coffee for 7 days. Color measurements were performed four times: at baseline (T0), after the demineralization procedure (T1), after the treatments (T2), and after immersion in coffee (T3). Results: No restoration of the initial enamel color was observed in any of the groups. The ICON and MA groups exhibited the highest masking effect, with the mean ΔET0-T2 = 7.46, although the differences among the study groups were insignificant. All three treatments increased the resistance of WSLs to discoloration in coffee compared to the negative control group; however, infiltration (∆ET2-T3 = 4.13) and microabrasion (∆ET2-T3 = 3.49) showed a better color stability tendency than nHAP remineralization (∆ET2-T3 = 7.26). Conclusions: Despite its well-known remineralizing and desensitizing effects, nHAP showed the least masking effect for WSLs and lower color stability compared to resin infiltration and microabrasion. However, none of the methods allowed for complete restoration of the original color. After the discoloration procedure, the color changes in the white spots treated with microabrasion and infiltration were comparable to those of the sound enamel."

METHODS: The individual components-hydroxyapatite (HAP), magnetite (F3O4), iron-doped hydroxyapatite (Fe/HAP), and polysuccinimide (PSI)-were synthesized and systematically characterized through Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Through a combination of single-factor experiments and Box-Behnken design (BBD) response surface methodology, the formulation parameters were optimized for two nanoparticle systems: (1) non-magnetic 5-FU-loaded PSI-HAP (designated as 5-FU@DC, where DC denotes \"drug carrier\") and (2) magnetic-targeted formulations 5-FU@PSI-Fe/HAP with varying iron content (5-FU@FeDC20, 5-FU@FeDC30, 5-FU@FeDC40). The engineered nanoparticles were thoroughly characterized for their morphological characteristics, hydrodynamic properties (particle size distribution and zeta potential), magnetic responsiveness (vibrating sample magnetometry), and pH-dependent drug release profiles. Nile Red was used to label the drug-loaded nanoparticles, and small animal imaging technology was employed to track their distribution in mice in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro studies examined the effects of these formulations on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of Huh-7 liver cancer cells. RESULTS: The formulations (5-FU@DC and 5-FU@FeDC) were found to form uniform spherical or near-spherical nanoparticles. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis confirmed that the 5-FU@FeDC formulations displayed paramagnetic properties. Zeta potential measurements showed that all prepared systems had negative charges, similar to human biological membranes. All nanoparticles gradually released the drug at pH levels above 5, with the release rate increasing as the pH increased. Compared to the non-magnetic 5-FU@DC formulation, the magnetic 5-FU@FeDC formulations showed significantly longer distribution and retention times in liver tissue and more effectively inhibited the proliferation of Huh-7 cells. CONCLUSION: The current study developed a magnetic targeting nano-delivery system using PSI and Fe/HAP as formulation excipients. The system offers uniform particle size, a simple preparation process, and a cost-effective method for targeted drug delivery. It is not only suitable for liver-targeted drug delivery but also applicable for drug delivery to other tissues in the body for anti-tumor drugs.",

The patient underwent surgical intervention with debridement, leading to a 2.2 cm bone defect and placement of a cylindrical synthetic bone graft (b.Bone), combined with bone marrow aspirate concentrate. This approach aimed to provide structural support and enhance biological healing. The choice of the cylindrical graft was due to its optimal fit and support for the anterior femoral cortex. Postoperative outcomes were favourable, with successful bone healing, confirmed radiologically, and restoration of function. This case demonstrates the potential of synthetic bone substitutes augmented with biological agents as a promising alternative to traditional grafts in managing complex non-unions.",

METHODS: The lab-based comparative study was approved by the ethical committee of King Saud University under IRB number F98-971X9 and was completed in three months (June to September, 2024). Eighty-four YTZP zirconia discs were created and sorted into four groups based on different conditioning agents: Group-I (APA) as the control, Group-II (TBC), Group-III (FS laser), and Group-IV (Nano-HA coating). Ra was measured on five discs from each group using a profilometer, while surface topography was examined through SEM analysis. Ten specimens per group were bonded with luting cement, followed by SBS testing and fracture mode analysis using a universal testing machine and stereomicroscope, respectively. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests (p<0.05) was used for statistical analysis of Ra and SBS means across the groups. RESULTS: Group-IV (Nano-HA coating) exhibited the highest Ra and SBS values. Conversely, Group II (TBC) displayed the lowest Ra and weakest bond strength. CONCLUSION: Nano-HA coating and FS laser can be employed as viable alternatives to APA without compromising the physical and mechanical properties of zirconia ceramic."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone-graft substitutes are a frequently employed method for the clinical reconstruction of osseous bone defects, and research on synthetic biomaterials is currently ongoing. Absorbable hemostatic gelatin sponge and hydroxyapatite-chitosan nanocomposites (nHAp/CS) have gained popularity in recent years because of their inherent characteristics: osteogenesis, osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 1) a gelatin-based hemostatic sponge (Surgispon) and 2) a combination of a weight ratio of 75/25 nHAp/CS composite with a Surgispon for osteogenic potential in the treatment of full-thickness segmental osseous defects in the radius of rabbits. METHODS: The 18 New Zealand rabbits had 10-mm-induced segmental diaphyseal defects of the left limb radius and were randomly allocated into three groups: group I left the defects untreated (control group), group II used a Surgispon, and group III had a weight ratio of 75/25 nHAp/CS composite wrapped with a Surgispon. Quantitative evaluation of the bone repair at the defect site in each group (n = 6), radiographic, gross, computed tomography (CT), and histopathological examinations were performed at 6 weeks (n = 3) and 12 weeks (n = 3) postoperatively. RESULTS: The quantitative statistical analysis of various evaluation methods at 6 weeks post-implantation demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). The statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups I and II, while groups I and III, were evident 12 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The findings of the radiographic, macroscopic, CT, and histopathological analyses firmly demonstrate that the combination of a 75/25 weight ratio composite of nHAp/CS with Surgispon is more effective than Surgispon alone in its ability to significantly increase bone formation. This could provide a prospective option for treating segmental bone defects.",

METHODS: A total of 120 PEEK disks were categorized into five groups: untreated PEEK (control), sandblasted with 50 μm alumina (Sa PEEK), etched with 98% sulfuric acid for 1 min (S PEEK), hydroxyapatite-coated sulfonated PEEK (HA PEEK), and phosphoric acid-etched HA-coated PEEK (HAP PEEK). Each group was subdivided into two groups (n = 12): Scotchbond Universal Plus (Scb) and Single Bond Universal (Sib) adhesive application and bond with flowable resin composite. SBS was evaluated after thermocycling for 5000 cycles and the results were analyzed using two-way and one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's HSD (α = 0.05). Failure mode was analyzed using light and scanning electron microscope. Surface roughness and contact angle analysis of each surface treatment were also done. RESULTS: HA PEEK exhibited the highest SBS in both Scb and Sib, while untreated PEEK showed the lowest. The effect of bonding agent can be seen only in S PEEK group where Sib demonstrated significantly higher SBS (P < 0.05) than Scb. Cohesive and mixed failures were observed in HA PEEK and HAP PEEK groups and others showed mostly adhesive failure. The wettability of PEEK increased after surface treatment except for Sa PEEK. CONCLUSIONS: HA PEEK consistently achieved the highest SBS, indicating that combining sulfonation with HA coating is an effective strategy to enhance bonding between PEEK and flowable resin composite.",

Calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA), a calcium phosphate (CaP), has structural and chemical characteristics similar to the mineral structure of human bones and teeth, offering bioactivity and biocompatibility properties. Photobiomodulation (PBM) uses light to reduce inflammation and accelerate tissue healing. This systematic review analyzes the combination of CaHA and PBM from 25 studies extracted from the PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases, using the keywords \"hydroxyapatite AND photobiomodulation\", \"calcium hydroxyapatite AND photobiomodulation\", and \"low-level laser therapy AND calcium phosphate.\" All studies focused on bone regeneration, with no mention of soft tissue applications. The most commonly used calcium-based material was biphasic calcium phosphate (76%), a combination of CaHA and β-tricalcium phosphate, while 16% of the studies did not specify the brand or product used. With regard to PBM, the most commonly used wavelengths (48% of cases, with a tie of 24% for each) were infrared lasers at 808 nm and 780 nm, with 20% of studies not mentioning the brand or manufacturer. The results underscore the predominant focus on bone regeneration, highlighting the need for further investigations into soft tissue applications and the establishment of standardized protocols. The combination of CaHA and PBM shows promise in regenerative medicine and dentistry, although more research is needed to expand its experimental and clinical use."

      "abstract": "Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient, recognized for its role in cellular redox systems and its therapeutic potential in cancer treatment. Organic selenium compounds, particularly selenocystine (SeCys), have demonstrated anticancer efficacy due to the ability to induce apoptosis and enhance the effects of chemotherapy agents. Recent studies have shown that SeCys exhibits selective toxicity against cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Unfortunately, its clinical application is limited by stability and solubility concerns. A possible solution to overcome these hurdles comes from recent advances in functionalized nanomaterials. In this study, we investigate the possible incorporation of SeCys with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HASeCys) via various methods (adsorption, co-precipitation, and co-precipitation through thermal decomplexation), resulting in the formation of nanocomposites with elemental selenium. The highest elemental selenium yield was achieved with a thermal decomplexing co-precipitation, highlighting the influence of synthesis parameters on Se allotrope formation. Finally, as a preliminary investigation, the HASeCys samples were tested on a panel of cancer cell lines, showing an interesting activity when the hydroxyapatite nanocrystals were functionalized with both crystalline gray and amorphous red selenium."

      "abstract": "The lack of bone grafts represents a major issue in the orthopedic field, reconstructive surgery, and dentistry. There are several bone conditions that often demand the use of grafts, such as fractures, infections, and bone cancer. The number of bone cancer cases increased in the past few decades and along with it, the need for bone grafting materials. To avoid the use of autografts and allografts there has been an increased interest towards synthetic grafts. This research aims to develop some collagen/hydroxyapatite (Coll/HAp) scaffolds cross-linked with three different agents that could be used in bone tissue engineering (BTE). These scaffolds were obtained with a freeze-drying method after the in situ formation of hydroxyapatite inside the collagen matrix. They were structurally and morphologically characterized and evaluated in terms of antimicrobial activity on E. coli and S. aureus bacterial strains. The results revealed that the scaffolds have porous structures with interconnected pores of suitable dimensions and well-distributed inorganic phases. Coll/HAp samples showed great antibacterial activity even without the use of typically used antibacterial agents. These findings allow us to conclude that these scaffolds are promising candidates for use in BTE and bone cancer treatment after the incorporation of specific antitumoral drugs."

This study aimed to investigate osteogenic differentiation of human pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) cultured on a 3D-printed poly lactic acid (PLA) scaffold coated with nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) and naringin (NAR) as a model for a dental regenerative. METHODS: PLA scaffolds were 3D printed into circular discs (10 × 1 mm) and coated with nHA, NAR, or both. Scaffolds were cultured with hDPTCs to identify cellular morphological changes and adhesion over incubation periods of 3, 7, and 21 days using SEM. Then, the osteogenic potential of PLA, PLA/nHA/NAR, or PLA scaffolds coated with MTA elutes (PLA/MTA scaffolds) were evaluated by measuring mineralized tissue deposition using calcium concentration assays and alizarin red staining (ARS). Also, immunofluorescence labelling of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) within cultured cells were evaluated. RESULTS: The highest cellular attachment was identified on the PLA/nHA/NAR scaffold, with morphological changes reflecting cellular differentiation. The highest calcium deposition and ARS were recognized in the PLA/nHA/NAR culture, with statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) compared to PLA/MTA. Also, ALP and DSPP markers showed statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05) immunoreactivity in cells cultured within PLA/nHA/NAR compared to PLA/MTA. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the osteogenic potential of PLA scaffolds coated with nHA/NAR for future animal and human investigations."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Three-dimensional (3D) ligand structures consisting of HA, PMMA, and target proteins of SHED were obtained from the PubChem database. STITCH was used for SHED target protein analysis, STRING was utilized for analysis and visualization of protein pathways related to osteogenesis, PASS Online was employed to predict biological functions supporting osteogenesis potential, PyRx 0.8 was used for molecular docking analysis, and PyMol was utilized to visualize the 3D structures resulting from the molecular docking analysis. RESULTS:  PMMA ligand was found to support osteogenesis through several biological functions, while interaction of HA ligand with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 20, DSPP, IBSP, SPP1, CD44, and MMP7 protein was revealed to play a role specifically in extracellular matrix organization. The interaction of all these proteins played a role in various pathways of osteogenesis. Toxicity level predictions of PMMA and HA were at class V and class III, respectively, which means that both ligands were shown to be neither hepatotoxic, carcinogenic, immunotoxic, nor cytotoxic. However, the ligand of PMMA had a lower binding affinity to SHED's protein (MMP7, MMP20, CD44, BMP7, and COL1A1) than the control ligand. CONCLUSION:  The interaction between HA-PMMA ligands and several SHED proteins showed biological process and osteogenesis pathways supporting the osteogenesis potential of PMMA-HA and SHED for alveolar bone defect therapy."

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study based in the Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital. METHODS: One hundred and one Chinese patients with HA implant exposure were identified, from which 38 patients with implants exposure after ten years of insertion were selected and analyzed for demographic and medical records, clinical manifestations, surgery type, implant size, exposure area, follow-up duration, complications, details regarding prosthesis care, and treatment methods. All of the removed implants were sent for an HE pathologic examination. RESULTS: The 38 cases experienced exposure 10 to 19 years after implantation and presented to the clinic with increased secretions, proliferation of granulation tissue, visible suture exposure, and difficulty in wearing the external prosthesis. Other complications included implant forward position in 3 patients, eyelid retraction in 4 patients, and all the patients presented with post-enucleation socket syndrome. Reviewing the medical history, HA implant sizes ranged from 18 to 22 mm. Fourteen patients underwent implant repair surgery, of which 2 experienced recurrence, and ultimately, 26 implants were removed. Of the 26 removed implants, histologic examination showed that 17 exhibited chronic infection, and 12 had limited fibrovascular ingrowth. The questionnaires indicated that 26 patients did not renew the external prosthesis regularly. CONCLUSION: This study identified late complications and potential risk factors for implant exposure beyond ten years of implantation, including chronic infection, non-absorbable sutures, and low and delayed vascularization."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently invades the jaw, and surgical treatment often leads to bone defects requiring reconstruction with titanium plates. To enhance the anti-tumor and bone regeneration properties of titanium, a selenium-modified hydroxyapatite coating was developed on titanium surfaces. METHODS: Selenium-modified hydroxyapatite coatings was fabricated using micro-arc oxidation (MAO). The coating properties were characterized by SEM, XPS, AFM, Contacting angle test and ICP-OES. Cell proliferation assays were performed using rBMSCs and Cal27 cells. The osteogenic potential of the materials was assessed via ALP and OCN immunofluorescence staining and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Apoptosis in Cal27 cells was analyzed through flow cytometry, and ROS levels in rBMSCs and Cal27 cells were measured using ROS fluorescent probes. RESULTS: A coating was successfully formed on the surface of titanium with a porous structure via MAO. The atomic percentages of calcium, phosphorus and selenium on the coating surface were 42.47%, 45.43% and 12.3%, respectively, and the ion components could be released steadily and slowly. In vitro, 0.2 µg/mL selenium had toxic effects on Cal27 and promoted osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. PCR showed that selenium increased the expression of genes related to osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by 3-5 times. ROS detection found differences in intracellular ROS content between Cal27 and rBMSCs. DISCUSSION: By incorporating selenium-modified coatings, titanium implant materials can simultaneously promote osteogenesis and inhibit tumor growth, offering a promising strategy for postoperative functional recovery in HNSCC patients."

      "abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as an effective cancer treatment strategy, which utilizes photothermal agents that accumulate at tumor sites and induce localized hyperthermia when irradiated. Near-infrared II (NIR II) fluorophores, such as the polymethine cyanine-based photothermal dye IR1061, exhibit higher temporal resolution and better tissue penetration, thereby making them promising candidates for PTT. However, challenges such as the low water solubility and in vivo short circulation times of these dyes limit their biological applications. To address these issues, we have developed a biocompatible and biodegradable delivery system in which IR1061 is encapsulated within lipid-coated hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (LHAPNIRs). The lipid shell is composed of DPPC/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG to retain the encapsulated dye and prevent serum protein adsorption and macrophage recognition, which would otherwise that hinder tumor targeting. Finally, the coat is functionalized with an acidity-triggered rational membrane (ATRAM) peptide for efficient and specific internalization into tumor cells in the mildly acidic microenvironment characteristic of tumors. The nanoparticles facilitated real-time thermal imaging and showed potent NIR-light triggered anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, with no noticeable toxicity to healthy tissue. Our results demonstrate that ATRAM-LHAPNIRs (ALHAPNIRs) combine potent PTT and robust diagnostic imaging capabilities."

The coating's limited adhesion to metal surfaces is a challenge, so improving it prevents delamination, inflammatory responses and mechanical failure of implants. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of Erbium-Doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Er: YAG) laser irradiation as a pre-treatment on Ti-6Al-4 V surfaces on the adhesion of HAp coatings. Two groups of Ti-6Al-4 V discs (G1: machined + HAp coated and G2: laser irradiated + HAp coated) were evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and the crystalline phases of the coating by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The physical properties were analyzed by microhardness, surface roughness and adhesion according to ASTM-D3359. Microhardness results were subjected to the t-test and surface roughness to the Mann-Whitney test. A 5% significance level was adopted. The characterization analyses were evaluated qualitatively. Laser treatment increased hardness (p = 0.013) and surface roughness (p = 0.002), while the untreated machined surface showed better coating adhesion. XRD, SEM and EDS analysis confirmed the formation of the HAp coating. Using the Er: YAG laser at the parameters determined in this study, no better adhesion of the coating was observed. However, laser irradiation provided greater hardness and roughness compared to films deposited on machined surfaces.",

Hydroxyapatite is one of the bioactive ceramics that has gained substantial research attention due to its biocompatibility, bioactivity and osteointegration ability for the manufacturing of nano bone grafts. The organized complex and porous structures of the human bone tissue is a nanocomposite which consists of both organic and inorganic matrix including hydroxyapatite naturally. Conventional hydroxyapatite was known to provide good adhesion and proliferation of host cells but very low mechanical strength. Hence biomaterial made of hydroxyapatite with various polymers and cross linking agents were used to enhance the mechanical strength of the material. Out of 293 articles obtained from the literature search, only 90 articles met the inclusion criteria about bone regeneration using nano hydroxyapatite materials. The present review addresses the potential capping agents with plant extracts for the synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanomaterials with multi-functional applications include drug delivery for targeting the desired therapeutic effect for bone regeneration with osteoprotective ability and tumour therapy.",

      "abstract": "Tendon injury is a common and challenging problem in the motor system that lacks an effective treatment, affecting daily activities and lowering the quality of life. Limited tendon regenerative capability and immune microenvironment dyshomeostasis are considered the leading causes hindering tendon repair. The chirality of biomaterials was proved to dictate immune microenvironment and dramatically affect tissue repair. Herein, chiral hierarchical structure hydroxylapatite (CHAP) nanoplates are innovatively synthesized for immunomodulatory purposes and further coated onto polylactic acid electrospinning membranes to achieve long-term release for tendon regeneration adaption. Notably, levorotatory-chiral HAP (L-CHAP) nanoplates rather than dextral-chiral or racemic-chiral exhibit good biocompatibility and bioactivity. In vitro experiments demonstrate that L-CHAP induces macrophage M2 polarization by enhancing macrophage efferocytosis, which alleviates inflammatory damage to tendon stem cells (TDSCs) through downregulated IL-17-NF-κB signaling. Meanwhile, L-CHAP-mediated macrophage efferocytosis also promotes TDSCs proliferation and tenogenic differentiation. By establishing a rat model of Achilles tendon injury, L-CHAP was demonstrated to comprehensively promoting tendon repair by enhancing macrophage efferocytosis and M2 polarization in vivo, finally leading to improvement of tendon ultrastructural and mechanical properties and motor function. This novel strategy highlights the role of L-CHAP in tendon repair and thus provides a promising therapeutic strategy for tendon injury."

Here, a carbon nanosphere (CNS) supported hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanorod (HAP/CNS) adsorbent was prepared using a simple glucose-assisted hydrothermal method toeffectively immobilize U(VI). Glucose not only derived CNS, but also facilitated HAP crystallization, prohibited HAP aggregation, and introduced oxygen-containing functional groups (i.e., COOH). The optimized HAP/CNS possessed a fantastic adsorption capability of 3080.3 mg/g for U(VI), nearly three times that of HAP and much higher than many reported HAP-based adsorbents. Notably, HAP/CNS was less affected by coexisting ions (distribution coefficient, Kd, researched 6.0 × 104 mL/g) and humic acid, and maintained good capability for real wastewater. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model could better explain U(VI) removal behavior by HAP/CNS. Results showed that HAP/CNS and UO22+ combined to form a new uranium-containing compound, i.e., calcium-uranium mica (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·3H2O) via ion exchange and dissolution-precipitation, which should be the main reason for the ultra-high capacity and selectivity of HAP/CNS. Additionally, the hydrophilic oxygen-containing functional groups synergistically facilitated U(VI) fixation through complexation. This work introduces a superior adsorbent for purifying uranium-contaminated wastewater and elucidates its synergetic mechanism in uranium fixation."

In this work, tricarboxylic cellulose/sodium alginate loaded with hydroxyapatite (HA) and/or graphene oxide (GO) was coagulated by calcium ions to create beads as scaffolds. In the first, cellulose was oxidized to water-soluble tricarboxylic cellulose (TCC) by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), periodate, and chlorite oxidation. HA was extracted from eggshells via microwave treatment, and GO was synthesized using the Hummer method. The structural behavior of the formed beads was meticulously investigated through various characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images confirmed the formation of particles of micrometric size without any specific morphology. Incorporating GO or HA does not affect the morphologies of the materials on the micrometric scale. The cytocompatibility of different bead preparations was studied on murine mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, the swellability in water and biodegradability by cellulase enzyme of prepared beads were studied. The results show that the prepared beads may be promising for bone tissue engineering."

Mechanical stability, appropriate osteoconductive bone grafts, and osteoinductive growth factors are necessary for bone regeneration in long bone diaphyseal defects. This study aimed to investigate the efficiency of a hybrid bone scaffold formed using hydroxyapatite (HAp) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2-containing alginate beads, combined with a barrier membrane, in promoting new bone formation in a rabbit radial segmental defect model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine rabbits were divided into two groups depending on the type of implant: Alginate beads containing HAp microparticles in phosphate-buffered saline (n=5) or BMP-2 (n=4). A 10-mm radial segmental defect was stabilized using a bone plate and screws, wrapped with an absorbable collagen membrane, and filled with alginate beads. Bone healing at the defect site was assessed via radiography, micro-computed tomography, and histological analysis after 12 weeks. RESULTS: The BMP-2/HAp alginate bead group showed significantly increased bone volume, polar moment of inertia, and periosteal callus ossification, along with a decreased fibrous infiltration at the defect site. Conversely, the BMP-2-unloaded HAp bead group exhibited membrane degradation, with no hard callus formation at the defect site. Therefore, HAp- and BMP-2-encapsulating alginate beads provided sufficient osteoconductive and osteoinductive support for long bone defect repair. CONCLUSION: BMP-2/HAp alginate beads, combined with an appropriate collagen membrane and proper internal fixation, may be an effective treatment strategy for long bone segmental defects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A ready-to-use hyaluronic acid-calcium hydroxyapatite (HA-CaHA) hybrid injectable has a dual mode of action for soft-tissue augmentation. Although previous studies have reported a favorable safety profile for HA-CaHA, there is a need for guidelines and recommendations based on real-world clinical experience for the management of complications associated with HA-CaHA. PURPOSE: This publication provides guidelines and recommendations for the prevention and management of HA-CaHA-related complications. A case study example, treatment algorithms, and injection techniques are included to illustrate the management of complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On January 25, 2023, 13 European physicians were invited to an advisory board meeting to discuss strategies for optimizing patient care, minimizing adverse events (AEs), and identifying data gaps for the prevention and management of complications with HA-CaHA. RESULTS: The management of a subset of AEs, including skin discoloration and edema, was discussed. Small group workshops also shared management algorithms for late noninflammatory adverse reactions, late inflammatory adverse reactions, localized vascular complications, and retinal vascular complications. Best practices for optimal injection techniques were discussed, and injection-technique protocols were developed for treatment sites. Treatment strategies for HA-CaHA-related complications are considered similar to treatment of those resulting from single-agent fillers, and knowledge of anatomy, aseptic technique, correct injection techniques, and appropriate posttreatment care is emphasized. CONCLUSION: These recommendations on the management of HA-CaHA-related complications may serve as a reference for the broad range of clinicians using HA-CaHA hybrid injectable for different indications and can help optimize patient outcomes and safety."

      "abstract": "The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of two different remineralising toothpastes in preventing dental caries and promoting oral health. Patients aged 6-18 years old with healthy and fully erupted first permanent molars (C1 and C2 DIAGNOdent scores) were enrolled and randomized into two groups according to the home-hydroxyapatite-based remineralising treatment used: the Trial group used zinc carbonate hydroxyapatite-based treatment (Biorepair Total Protective Repair), while the Control group used magnesium strontium carbonate hydroxyapatite conjugated with chitosan toothpaste (Curasept Biosmalto Caries Abrasion & Erosion). Dental and periodontal parameters were measured over a six-month period, including the DIAGNOdent Pen Index (primary outcome), BEWE Index, Plaque Index, Bleeding Score, Schiff Air Index, and ICDAS assessed with DIAGNOcam. A total of 40 patients were equally allocated in the two groups and finally analyzed. A significant reduction in the DIAGNOdent Pen score was reported in the Trial group after 1 month of treatment, while in the Control group, no significant change was found. The Trial group also showed a significant reduction in plaque levels after 3 months of treatment, while in the Control group, it occurred after 1 month. However, the Bleeding Score and Schiff Air Index showed no significant differences between the groups, suggesting that additional measures may be required to address gingival inflammation and hypersensitivity. The ICDAS index also showed no statistically significant changes, due to the limited duration of this study. Overall, zinc-hydroxyapatite-based toothpaste was more effective than magnesium strontium carbonate hydroxyapatite toothpaste in enhancing enamel remineralisation in the short-term period. The assigned treatments did not result in significant improvements in the oral indexes assessed in this study."

      "abstract": "For the effective treatment of vertebral bone defects (BDs), the authors constructed an innovative hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticle-hyaluronic acid (HA)-alginate (ALG) scaffold loaded with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). The particle size of HAP was around 80 to 100 nm, and its addition markedly reduced the swelling rate and degradability of the HA-ALG scaffold while enhancing its compression resistance, enabling it to better support the BD site and provide a good proliferation environment for osteoblasts. Furthermore, HAP-HA-ALG effectively extended the half-life of rhBMP-2 by nearly 50-fold, allowing it to exert its osteogenic effects more consistently. In cellular experiments, the authors found that rhBMP-2@HAP-HA-ALG significantly enhanced the activity and migration ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, as well as the expression level of related osteogenic proteins in cells, which better exerted osteoinductive and osteoconductive functions. In animal tests, rhBMP-2@HAP-HA-ALG could better facilitate the generation of new bone and bone trabecula at BD sites and markedly enhance the bone density level, thus shortening the repair time of BDs. Therefore, rhBMP-2@HAP-HA-ALG shows great potential in the restoration of vertebral BDs."

In this study, a novel photocatalytic erbium-doped hydroxyapatite-decorated titanium dioxide (TiO2@Er-Hap) was obtained using the sol-gel method and applied to remove ciprofloxacin (CIP) drug and methylene blue (MB) dye contaminants. The sample's structural, physical, morphological, and photocatalytic properties were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the presence of the anatase phase in TiO2@Er-Hap. The oxide nanoparticles were deposited on the Hap surface, and the proposed material presented a band gap energy of 3.33 eV. Furthermore, TiO2@Er-Hap presented a larger surface area when compared with the material not decorated with the oxide. Photocatalysis tests performed under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation showed that TiO2@Er-Hap removed MB dye (100%) and CIP (71.16%), despite low mineralization evidenced in TOC analysis. The irradiated pollutant solution after the photocatalysis process was nontoxic, as observed in the ecotoxic test, indicating that the photocatalytic worked. Inhibitor tests showed that the •OH radicals were the main species involved in the tests performed. The material demonstrated activity even after five consecutive cycles of use. Finally, the results suggest that TiO2@Er-Hap is a suitable candidate for water decontamination via photocatalytic processes."

J Dent 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2024.105429 . DATA SOURCES: The search strategy for this review aimed at finding the published articles in which hydroxyapatite has been used as an intervention agent for caries prevention, compared with either active control like fluoride-products, placebo, or no interventions. For this, authors used a combination of keywords indicative of various PICOS framework elements. The search was carried out in various electronic databases, including Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. STUDY SELECTION: Both clinical trials and in-situ studies were included in this review. A total of 1245 articles were retrieved from the search, but 1227 articles were removed as they did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 18 articles, including clinical trials and in-situ studies, were included in the review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: All the included articles were assessed for quality using NHLBI criteria before including them in the meta-analysis. The outcome measures from the clinical trials mainly included the caries incidence, recorded as dmft(s)/DMFT(S) or using ICDAS criteria, while the data for outcome measures from in-situ studies included different surrogate markers. RESULTS: The meta-analysis done for the included clinical trials depicted HAP toothpastes to be significantly better for caries prevention when compared with the placebo toothpastes (pooled OR = 2.51). The results also favored HAP toothpaste when compared with fluoride toothpaste (pooled OR = 1.1) but the results were non-significant. For in-situ studies too, significant results were obtained, favouring HAP toothpaste in terms of lesion depth (overall mean change of 1.15 µm) and bacterial loads (overall mean reduction of 65%), while non-significant results, favouring HAP, were obtained in terms of remineralization (overall mean change of 2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: HAP toothpastes are found to be effective in preventing caries and can be considered as good alternative for fluoride.",

      "abstract": "Shortage of phosphorus resource has become a global concern. Due to the high phosphorus content in sewage sludge, phosphorus recovery can be realized from thermal products of sewage sludge. Phosphorus recovery performance of smoldering ash (SA), incineration ash (IA) and pyrolysis char (PC) was investigated. The precipitate rate of phosphorus in acid and alkali leaching solutions is over 94 % by magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) methods. For MAP method, the recovered P contents in the precipitations of SA, IA and PC are 23.25 ± 0.35, 31.71 ± 0.79 and 23.76 ± 0.24 mg/g, respectively. For HAP recovery, the phosphorus contents per unit mass of precipitated products are lower than that by MAP, ranging from 13.67 ± 0.10 to 22.89 ± 0.34 mg/g. The purity of the recovered products was evaluated based on the contents of major elements and heavy metals in recovered products. Most of major elements and heavy metals can coprecipitate with phosphorus in the recovery products by acid leaching-MAP method. Due to the low impurity content in the alkali leaching solution and insolubility of most heavy metals in it, the products recovered by alkali leaching-HAP shows higher purity than that by acid leaching-MAP method. The phosphorus recovery performance, reagent consumption and purity of recovered products of the two methods were compared. Acid leaching-MAP recovery is optimal for IA due to its highest P recovery and purity, with lower reagent consumption compared to alkali leaching-HAP. For SA and PC, alkali leaching-HAP recovery is preferable due to its higher P recovery purity and market price of hydroxyapatite products.",

Therefore, we developed freeze-dried scaffolds based on the in situ synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAp NPs) within a gelatin-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-alginate matrix using a co-precipitation method. Ceftazidime and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were used as drug models and were separately loaded into the fabricated scaffolds. The hybrid scaffolds exhibited an ultimate compressive strength of 1.1 MPa and flexible behavior favored for fitting irregular bone defects. 5-FU-loaded scaffolds showed higher bioactive potential within 3 days compared to ceftazidime-loaded scaffolds. The scaffolds exhibited a long-term degradation rate, and thereby prolonged release of ceftazidim and 5-FU for up to 28 days. 5-FU-loaded scaffolds showed excellent nearly equal antibacterial activity to ceftazidime-loaded scaffolds against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli strains. Osteosarcoma cell death was achieved by increased concentrations of ceftazidime and 5-FU treatment above 300 μg/mL and 250 μg/mL, respectively. The developed scaffolds displayed higher bone formation ability with better osteogenesis in a femoral rat bone defect model compared to the control sample. This work represents a promising solution for bone defect repair and provides insight into the development of multifunctional scaffolds for local chemotherapy and bone tissue engineering applications."

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is common in all age groups, and a multifaceted strategy that includes radiation therapy, surgical intervention and chemotherapy remains the conventional treatment for osteosarcoma. Existing therapies typically result in recurring malignancies and postsurgical bone abnormalities, necessitating novel strategies for targeted drug administration and bone defects. The most significant components that are crucial for maintain strong bones include trace elements, calcium, selenium, and vitamins K and D. A deficiency in selenium advances the risk of cancer in many organs, including the bones. The progression of an effective technique such as a \"local delivery system\" is required to efficiently deliver the antioxidant to the targeted tissues for treatment as the circulatory system is unable to convey an adequate concentration of catechin to the regions of bone abnormalities. In this regard the combination of selenium and catechin with mesoporous hydroxyapatite nanoparticles displays promise as a nanoscale delivery method, offering an ideal approach to use it for the treatment and prevention of bone-related diseases. Therefore, this review mainly focusing in exploring the therapeutic potential of catechins-modified selenium-doped hydroxyapatite nanomaterials, chitosan-PEG-folate-Fe (III) complexes as nanocarriers for epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and catechin-conjugated mesoporous hydroxyapatite nanoparticle, highlighting their novel functions as nano-antioxidants with improved osteogenic characteristics in osteosarcoma treatment.",

      "abstract": "Despite the promise of sonodynamic therapy (SDT)-mediated immunotherapy, the anticancer efficacy of current sonosensitizers is greatly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and their inability to selectively respond to it. Herein, oxygen vacancy-rich MnO2@hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) core-shell nanospheres (denoted as Ov-MO@CPO) as an advanced TME-responsive sonosensitizer for sonodynamic immunotherapy is demonstrated. The Ov-MO@CPO maintains its structural integrity under neutral conditions but dissolves the pH-sensitive hydroxyapatite shell under acidic TME to release active oxygen vacancy-rich MnO2 core, which reinvigorates H2O2 consumption and hypoxia alleviation due to its catalase-like activity. Furthermore, the introduced oxygen vacancies optimize the electronic structure of Ov-MO@CPO, with active electronic states near the Fermi level and higher d-band center. It results in accelerated electron-hole pair separation and lower catalytic energy barriers to boost ultrasound (US)-initiated ROS production. These multimodal synergistic effects effectively reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. No evident toxic effects are observed in normal mouse tissues. Additionally, when combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Ov-MO@CPO-mediated SDT further improves the effectiveness of immunotherapy. This work affords a new avenue for developing TME-dependent sonosensitizers for SDT-mediated immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, novel biomaterials are under intense research because they are part of promising therapies for the treatment of age-related diseases such as osteoporosis and bone defects. In the presented study, composites of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), micro and nano hydroxyapatite (µ-HAp and n-HAp) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared. The influence of additives on polymeric matrix was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman micro-spectroscopy, Raman mapping, and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS). The bioactivity in vitro was evaluated by a 21-day incubation of prepared membranes in simulated body fluid (SBF). It was concluded that additives can behave as crystallization nuclei of PCL, but they are also located across the entire surface of PCL spherulites, not only in the center. With an increasing content of HAp additives, polymeric spherulites become smaller. The type of HAp (µ-HAp or n-HAp) influences the PCL matrix differently, as confirmed by 2D-COS. The component whose addition leads to most significant changes in the polymer is CNFs; polymeric spherulites are small to the extent that they are not distinguishable, and the overall amorphousness of the polymer is the highest among all tested materials, as is its hydrophobicity. The bioactivity test indicated that the membrane with the greatest potential for use as a biomaterial in bone tissue engineering is one consisting of n-HAp (15 wt%) and CNFs, as very uniform coverage of the produced apatite was observed on the surface of this membrane after incubation in SBF."

      "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of acute traumas, surgical wounds, and chronic skin wounds poses significant therapeutic challenges for wound treatment. One of the main concerns in wound care is the danger of infection, which is a significant barrier to healing and a cause of higher morbidity and mortality rates. The emergence of drug-resistant bacterial species is becoming more frequent every day. Antimicrobial dressings have become a viable strategy for wound healing and hospital expense savings. Several factors, such as the wound's localization and state, microbial load, and cost, must be considered when choosing an appropriate antimicrobial dressing. One of the key goals of wound care is infection avoidance. This study addresses the therapeutic challenges of acute traumas, surgical wounds, and chronic skin wounds, focusing on infection prevention and combating drug-resistant bacterial strains. The research explores the development of novel composite wound dressings incorporating hydroxyapatite, known for its osteoconductive properties, and essential oils from basil and cinnamon, recognized for their antimicrobial activity. The study evaluates the impact of these additives on key properties such as surface morphology, water absorption, enzymatic degradation, and mechanical performance. Antimicrobial tests showed that two experimental samples (A1S and A1BS) exhibited significant activity against Escherichia coli but not on Staphylococcus aureus. The results highlight the dressings' enhanced antimicrobial properties, mechanical strength, and controlled degradation, making them promising candidates for advanced wound healing. Tailored applications were identified, with each dressing composition offering unique benefits for specific wound-healing scenarios based on the balance between flexibility, structural support, and bioactivity."

      "abstract": "The treatment of bone cancer often necessitates the surgical removal of affected tissues, with artificial implants playing a critical role in replacing lost bone structure. Functionalized implants represent an innovative approach to improve bio-integration and the long-term effectiveness of surgery in treating cancer-damaged bones. In this study, nickel-substituted hydroxyapatite (Ni:HAp) nanoparticles were deposited as thin films using laser pulses in the range of 30,000-60,000. Comprehensive structural, infrared, optical, morphological, surface, and magnetic evaluations were conducted on the synthesized Ni:HAp thin films. The magnetic hysteresis (M-H) loop demonstrated an increase in the saturation magnetization of the films with a higher number of laser pulses. A minimum squareness ratio of 0.7 was observed at 45,000 laser pulses, and the M-H characteristics indicated a shift toward ferromagnetic behavior, achieving the desired thermal response through an alternating magnetic field application within 80 s. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed distinct thermal stability, with the material structure exhibiting 46% degradation at 800 °C. The incorporation of bioactive magnetic nanoparticles in the thin film holds significant promise for magnetic hyperthermia treatment. Using HDOCK simulations, the interactions between ligand molecules and proteins were also explored. Strong binding affinities with a docking score of -67.73 were thus observed. The presence of Ca2+ ions enhances electrostatic interactions, providing valuable insights into the biochemical roles of the ligand in therapeutic applications. Intravenous administration of magnetic nanoparticles, which subsequently aggregate within the tumor tissue, combined with an applied alternating magnetic field, enable targeted heating of the tumor to 45 °C. This focused heating approach selectively targets cancer cells while preserving the surrounding healthy tissue, thereby potentially enhancing the effectiveness of hyperthermia therapy in cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Phosphorus applications in agriculture can lead to significant environmental impacts, necessitating a revolution in current agricultural practices. This study explores the potential of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nHAPs) synthesized from poultry bones as P fertilizers. nHAPs were produced at 300 °C (nHAP300) and 700 °C (nHAP700), and their effectiveness was evaluated. An in vitro solubilization test with Pseudomonas alloputida evaluated the bacterium's ability to solubilize the nanoparticles, assessing dissolved P and organic acids produced. Additionally, a soil leaching test measured P losses and bioavailable P in soil compared to a conventional fertilizer, the triple superphosphate (TSP). nHAP300 displayed heterogeneous sizes, while nHAP700 were approximately 100 nm in size, with a P content of 8.8% and 19.4%, respectively. Pseudomonas alloputida successfully solubilized both types of nanoparticles, with nHAP700 demonstrating a higher solubility than nHAP300. The TSP treatment resulted in higher P losses (6.35 mg) compared with nHAP treatments (nHAP300 0.32 mg; nHAP700 0.28 mg), indicating the potential of nHAP for recycling P from waste. Our findings indicate that nHAP700 are more efficient in P release than nHAP300 but less prone to leaching compared to conventional fertilizers. Utilizing these nanoparticles enables phosphorus recovery from waste and holds significant potential for sustainable agricultural applications.",

METHODS: Four adult beagle dogs underwent hemisecting of the mandibular premolars, followed by the extraction of the mesial roots. Soft tissue augmentations were randomly conducted with collagen membranes composed of poly (L-Lactic-co-caprolactone) and porcine fibrinogen (PLCL/F-Fg), PLCL/F-Fg membranes blended with nHA (PLCL/F-Fg/nHA), or a sham-operated control. The animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks post-surgery and received volumetric analyses. Histological examinations at the meantime were carried out at five different depths below the crest (0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 5.5 mm). RESULTS: Histological examinations showed a statistically significant increase in buccal gingival thickness between PLCL/F-Fg/20%nHA and PLCL/F-Fg (3.82 ± 1.56mm vs 1.78 ± 0.20mm (at 3.5 mm); 4.23 ± 0.63mm vs 1.80 ± 0.58mm (at 5.5 mm)) as well as between PLCL/F-Fg/20%nHA and PLCL/F-Fg/10%nHA (4.23 ± 0.63mm vs 1.97 ± 0.73mm (at 5.5 mm)). Volumetric analyses showed a statistically significant decrease in volume reduction between PLCL/F-Fg/20%nHA and PLCL/F-Fg (4.46 ± 2.75mm3 vs 10.27 ± 4.77mm3) as well as between PLCL/F-Fg/20%nHA and PLCL/F-Fg/10%nHA (4.46 ± 2.75mm3 vs 10.57 ± 2.88mm3). CONCLUSION: PLCL/F-Fg/20%nHA membranes demonstrated effectiveness in the gingival thickness augmentation on the buccal side of canine teeth at 12 weeks postsurgery. The electrospinning collagen membranes blended with nHA rendered an alternative treatment for soft tissue volume augmentations at the pontic site."

      "abstract": "AIM: Preservation of ridge dimensions is the important aspect after tooth extraction for prosthetic and implant rehabilitation. Titanium-platelet rich fibrin (T-PRF) is an autologous biomaterial, and when used with bone graft it could enhance the bone regeneration. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of T-PRF with nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (Nano-HA) and T-PRF with demineralized bone matrix (DMBM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty systemically healthy patients were included in the study and were randomly assigned into two groups. Ten patients were treated with atraumatic extraction followed by ridge preservation using Nano-HA bone graft and T-PRF. In another group of ten patients, ridge preservation was done using a xenograft-DMBM. Preoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and postoperative CBCT after 3 months were evaluated for bone fill. The clinical parameters of ridge width (RW) and ridge height were measured clinically, with the help of UNC 15 probe, after 3 months. RESULTS: The treatment modality resulted in significant bone fill in CBCT and adequate RW clinically in both the groups. The mean bone density in the Nano-HA + T-PRF group was recorded as 776.72 ± 223.94, and 854.72 ± 183.57 was observed in the DMBM + T-PRF group, after 14-16 weeks. CONCLUSION: The study's findings indicate that ridge preservation performed at the time of extraction is a reliable and predictable approach for minimizing alveolar bone resorption. Additionally, the combination of T-PRF with bone grafts yields effective results in a relatively short timeframe. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This technique involves combining osteoconductive material from Nano-HA and DMBM and the growth factor-rich matrix of T PRF for quicker healing and better esthetic and functional results. It reduces morbidity in patients, does not require an autogenous graft, is biocompatible, and is economical; therefore, both clinical practice and regenerative research in the field of dentistry are advanced. Hence, it is one of the important evidences through this original study. How to cite this article: Patil RT, Dhadse PV, Salian SS, et al.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Yttrium-90 plays a significant role in managing drug-resistant inflammatory arthritis through radionuclide synovectomy, where the radioisotope is injected into the affected joint to alleviate pain and inflammation by targeting the synovial tissue. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Yttrium-90 hydroxyapatite radionuclide synovectomy in improving joint functionality, as judged by physicians, in patients with inflammatory arthritis who had not responded to conventional treatments. METHODS: Patients with inflammatory arthritis were recruited from the orthopedics department and referred to the nuclear medicine department for evaluation. A three-phase bone scan was conducted to identify eligible patients, who then received intra-articular injections of Yttrium-90 hydroxyapatite along with triamcinolone. After 48 h, patients underwent PET-CT imaging, followed by two follow-ups at 2 and 6 months to assess improvements in joint functionality and monitor for adverse reactions. RESULTS: Fifteen patients underwent radionuclide synovectomy. Significant improvements were observed between baseline and 2 months in joint restriction ( P  = 0.001), pain severity ( P  = 0.037), visual analog scale (VAS) ( P  = 0.004), and swelling ( P  = 0.002). At 6 months, further improvements were noted in joint restriction ( P  = 0.002), pain severity ( P  = 0.019), VAS ( P  = 0.013), and swelling ( P  = 0.023). However, no significant changes occurred between the 2- and 6-month follow-ups. One patient experienced radiation-induced skin necrosis, which resolved with conservative treatment, and another had self-limited skin rashes. CONCLUSION: Yttrium-90 hydroxyapatite radionuclide synovectomy proved to be an effective and safe treatment for improving joint functionality in patients with drug-resistant inflammatory arthritis of the knee for up to 6 months.",

      "abstract": "Although iron-doped hydroxyapatite (Fe-HAP) and its composites have been reported to immobilize arsenic (As), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd), its practical application is limited by the inefficient release of iron and phosphate. In this study, Ochrobactrum anthropic, a phosphate-solubilizing bacterium isolated from a lead-zinc smelting site, was employed to enhance multi-heavy metal immobilization in Fe-HAP-amended soils. O. anthropic secreted low-molecular-weight organic acids, promoted phosphate (25.6 mg/L) and iron (14.2 mg/L) release from Fe-HAP, and minimally disrupted native bacteria. Compared to CK, the combination of 2 % O. anthropic (v/w) and Fe-HAP (Fe-to-HAP ratio of 1:1) significantly increased the residual fractions of Cd, Pb, and As by 109.09 %, 49.21 %, and 25.00 %, respectively. The combined treatment also improved available phosphorus, available nitrogen, and acid phosphatase activity by 233.24 %, 196.55 %, and 246.45 %, respectively. Furthermore, O. anthropic facilitated the recruitment of phylum Firmicutes and genera Acidovorax, Sedimentibacter, and Brevundimonas, shifting the bacterial community from specialists to generalists. Positive correlations were observed between residual fractions of Pb, Cd, As, well-crystallized As, and the abundance of Firmicutes, Acidovorax, and Sedimentibacte. These findings demonstrate the potential of an O. anthropic-driven Fe-HAP remediation strategy for the eco-friendly restoration of barren and polymetallic-contaminated soils.",

Furthermore, the use of long-term high-dose antibiotics in standard treatment increases the risks of antibiotic resistance. Herein, an antibiotic-free, collagen silver-doped hydroxyapatite (coll-AgHA) scaffold reinforced with a 3D printed polycaprolactone (PCL) framework was developed with enhanced mechanical properties to be used in the repair of load-bearing defects with antimicrobial properties as a preventative measure against osteomyelitis. The AgHA particles were fabricated in varying Ag doses and loaded within freeze-dried collagen scaffolds at two concentrations. The optimised Ag dose (1.5 mol% Ag) and AgHA concentration (200 wt%) within the collagen scaffold demonstratedin vitroosteogenic and antibacterial properties againstS. aureus (S. aureus),the main causative pathogen of osteomyelitis. The addition of the PCL framework to the coll-AgHA scaffolds significantly enhanced the compressive modulus from 4 to 12 MPa while maintaining high porosity as well as both pro-osteogenic and antibacterial properties. The reinforced coll-AgHA scaffolds were implantedin vivoand demonstrated enhanced bone repair, significantly greater vessel formation, and calcified tissue in a load-bearing critical sized defect in rats. Taken together, these results confirm the capacity of this novel biomaterial scaffold as a preventative measure against infection in bone repair for use in load-bearing defects, without the use of antibiotics.",

In the past two decades, numerous biological treatments have been developed to alleviate orthodontic relapse. Pharmacologic bone modulation is a viable approach to mitigate relapse. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether administering nanoemulsion carbonated hydroxyapatite-statin (CHA-statin) would increase Runx-2 expression and decrease Acp 5 expression in rats experiencing experimental orthodontic relapse. MATERIALS & METHODS: Forty-eight rats (n = 48) were assigned to four groups: control, CHA, statin, and CHA-statin, with 12 rats in each group. A 30 g mesial traction was applied for 7 days via a closed-coil spring that connected the first maxillary molar to the maxillary incisor. To maintain the moved teeth, CHA, statin hydrogel, and nanoemulsion CHA-statin were administered intrasulcularly every 3 days for a period of 7 days. The removal of the devices facilitated the occurrence of relapse. The expression of Acp 5 and Runx-2 was evaluated using the immunohistochemistry method. The collected data were evaluated using analysis of variance and post hoc tests, with p < 0.05. RESULTS: A significant reduction in Acp 5-positive cells in the CHA-statin group was observed on days 7 and 14 of relapse movement compared with the other groups (p < 0.05), whereas the average Runx-2 expressions in the CHA-statin groups were significantly higher than in the other groups on days 1, 7, and 14 during the relapse phase (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The nanoemulsion CHA-statin increased Runx-2 expression and decreased Acp 5 expression, thereby potentially preventing orthodontic relapse in rats."

Due to its properties HA is studied for various applications such as bone graft, drug carrier, heterogeneous catalyst or sorbent for waste water treatment. HA can be synthesized or valorized from bone wastes, as the food industry produce billions of kilograms of animal bones. The oxidative hydrothermal treatment presented in this work offers an alternative to the conventional calcination in order to remove the organic matter contained in bones. The impact of adding dioxygen into the hydrothermal system on the degradation of organic matter was studied by varying the partial O2 pressure from 0 to 30 bar. In addition, the influence of temperature (220, 250, and 280 °C) and dwelling time (0 and 2 h) at these temperatures was investigated. The degradation of the organic matter was proved by TGA-DSC and FTIR. The presence of organic compounds dissolved in water was assessed by TOC measurements and the production of CO2 was followed by Raman spectroscopy. A hydroxyapatite powder with an organic content <1 wt% has been successfully recovered at a lower temperature, for a shorter duration and with a lower production of CO2 compared to calcination. In addition, the recovered HA has a much higher specific surface area (up to 164 m2/g) compared to calcined bones (up to 83.1 m2/g), which is favorable for biomedical and sorbent applications.",

The nHA is also a well-known biomaterial which has chemical and structural similarities to bone minerals. Hence, we aim to explore the use of the nHA as a potential nanocarrier for the TRF. Methods: In this study, we develop and optimize the formulation of an nHA-encapsulating TRF (nHA/TRF) by employing the response surface methodology (RSM). Results: RSM outcomes reveal that the mass of the nHA, the concentration of the TRF, and the incubation time have a significant effect on the particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of the nHA/TRF. The outcomes for the optimized formulation are not significantly different from the predicted RSM outcomes. The optimized nHA/TRF formulation is freeze-dried and results in an average particle size of ~270 nm, a negative zeta potential value of ~-20 mV, a polydispersity index of <0.4, and an encapsulation efficiency of ~18.1%. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the freeze-dried nHA/TRF has a spherical structure. Conclusions: Taken together, the above findings indicate that the nHA may be established as a nanocarrier for efficient delivery of the TRF, as demonstrated by the promising physical properties."

      "abstract": "The repercussions of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and bisphosphonates pose serious clinical challenges and warrant novel therapies for osteoporosis in menopausal women. To confront this issue, the present research aimed to design and fabricate daidzein (DZ); a phytoestrogen-loaded hydroxyapatite nanoparticles to mimic and compensate for synthetic estrogens and biomineralization. Hypothesizing this bimodal approach, hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAPNPs) were synthesized using the chemical-precipitation method followed by drug loading (DZHAPNPs) via sorption. The developed nanoparticles were optimized by \"Design-Expert\" software and underwent comprehensives in-vitro and in-vivo characterizations. The particle sizes of HAPNPs and DZHAPNPs were found to be 118.9 ± 0.15 nm and 129.3 ± 0.65 nm, respectively, consistent with their FESEM and TEM images. A notable entrapment efficiency of 87.23 ± 0.97% and drug release of 91 ± 0.85% from DZHAPNPs was observed over 90 h at pH 7.4. Moreover, the XRD and FTIR results confirmed the amorphization and compatibility of DZHAPNPs. TGA analysis indicated that the thermal stability of blank and drug-loaded nanoparticles was up to 900 °C. In an in vivo pharmacokinetic investigation, three-fold increased bioavailability of DZHAPNPs (AUC0-∞ = 7427.6 µg/mL*h) was obtained in comparison to daidzein solution (AUC0-∞ = 2299.7 µg/mL*h). The comprehensive results of the study indicate that bioceramic nanoparticles are potential carriers for DZ delivery.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare remineralisation efficacy between silver diamine fluoride (SDF) combined with potassium iodide (KI) and sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish using hydroxyapatite (HAP) artificial white spot lesions (AWSLs) demineralisation model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 HAP disks was randomly divided into five groups (n = 5): baseline, AWSLs, deionized water (DW), SDF-KI or F-varnish. After AWSLs were developed, the specimen was treated with either deionized water, SDF-KI or F-varnish. These specimens were then subjected to pH-cycling for 7 days. The remineralisation potential was assessed by measuring changes in Vickers hardness (VHN). Morphological and compositional analyses were conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) were utilised to measure calcium and fluoride release. RESULTS: SDF-KI treatment demonstrated statistically significant remineralisation potential in restoring VHN values vs baseline levels (p 0.001). SEM, EDX, and XRD analyses confirmed the mineral deposits to indicate remineralisation. The uptake of calcium was higher in SDF-KI than in F-varnish (p = 0.011). The fluorapatite (FAP) and fluoride-substituted apatite formation were validated by FTIR and XRD analyses. CONCLUSION: SDF-KI and F-varnish applications are both effective in promoting remineralisation on HAP disks. The application of SDF-KI affected the physicochemical and mechanical properties of demineralised HAP. The SDF-KI showed more formation of fluoride-substituted apatite and is effective in the hardening of demineralised HAP.",

      "abstract": "Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a well-known medically renowned bioactive material known for its excellent biocompatibility and mechanical stability, but it lacks fast bioactivity. The restricted release of ions from hydroxyapatite encourages the search for a faster bioactive material that could replicate other properties of HAP. A new sol-gel-mediated potentially bioactive glass material that could mimic the structure of HAP but can surpass the performance of HAP bioactively has been formulated in this study. Lefebvre et al. suggested that the silicorhenanite phase with the formula Na2Ca4(PO4)2SiO4 is isostructural to hydroxyapatite; however, data in support of this hypothesis are scant. This study succeeds in developing fast apatite-growth-inducing bioactive glass particles similar to the structure of hydroxyapatite. Also, for the first time, the existence and evolution of two forms of silicorhenanite (α- and β-Na2Ca4(PO4)2SiO4) have been unraveled, and their properties have been explored. The effect of calcination temperature on the phase formation of the biomaterial is notified by looking into the result that heat treatment to 900 °C resulted in α-Na2Ca4(PO4)2SiO4 (Sili 900) and 1000 °C yielded β-Na2Ca4(PO4)2SiO4 (Sili 1000). This study conveys a new finding that the hydroxyapatite is isostructural to β-Na2Ca4(PO4)2SiO4 but not to α-Na2Ca4(PO4)2SiO4. Raman spectroscopic analysis proved this structural similarity of Sili 1000 and c-HAP, with relative spectra possessing phosphate bands and the irrelevance of Sili 900 to Sili 1000 and c-HAP. The in vitro MTT assay using NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and in vivo wound healing study confirm the enhanced bioactivity and compatibility of Sili 900 and Sili 1000 compared to c-HAP, favored by the presence of a silica matrix and semicrystallinity. pH analysis proved the rapid ionic leaching out from Sili 900 and Sili 1000 and the faster reactivity of Sili 1000 with the fluid. This rapid burst of ions enhances the clotting ability of the Sili 1000 bioactive material and can be a good ibuprofen drug carrier, which is a potential challenger to hydroxyapatite.",

This study aimed to characterize HANPs, examine their influence on kidneys, and explore the potential protective effects of naturally extracted red pigment (RP) from Monascus purpureus against HANPs-induced renal toxicity. To this aim, forty eight adult male rats were randomly divided into 8 equal groups: a control group receiving 4% dimethyl sulfoxide (the solvent for HANPs), three groups receiving extracted RP at different doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, a group receiving HANPs at a dose of 88.3 mg/kg, and three more groups receiving a double treatment of HANPs associated with RP. The respective treatment was given daily by oral gavage to animals for 50 days which is the duration of the whole experiment. The renal toxicity caused by HANPs was manifested by aberrations in kidney function parameters, intensification of oxidative stress markers, and a decrease in the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, an increase in inflammatory (TNF-α and TGF-β) and apoptotic (caspace-3) markers, an elevation in gene-based kidney injuries markers (Kim-1 and lipocalin-2), and pathological tissue changes were determined. Meanwhile, co-treatment with different doses of biopigment and HANPs have reduced oxidative stress via their potent antioxidant effect. This was confirmed by pronounced improvement in the measured parameters along with the histological structural enhancement in a dose dependent manner compared to controls. To sum up, RP from M. purpureus has potential protective benefits in mitigating the adverse effects of HANPs.",

      "abstract": "Hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanocoatings on titanium alloys (e.g. Ti6Al4V) have been used for prosthetic orthopaedic implants in recent decades because of their osseointegration, bioactivity, and biocompatibility. HAp is brittle with low mechanical strength and poor adhesion to metallic surfaces, which limits its durability and bioactivity. Surface modification techniques have alleviated the imperfections in biomaterials by coating the substrate. Several methods for improving the characteristics of implants, such as physical vapour deposition, the thermal spray method, the sol-gel method, microarc oxidation, and electrochemical deposition methods, have been discussed in this review. These processes provide mechanical strength without sacrificing biocompatibility and may lead to the development of new ideas for future research. This review discusses various selective additives, including carbon allotropes, ceramic materials, metallic materials, and multiple materials, to enhance tribological characteristics, biocompatibility, wear resistance, and mechanical strength. This review focuses on the fabrication of nano-HAps as coatings using selective deposition methods with controlled deposition parameters, paying special attention to recent developments in bone tissue engineering. This report is organized in such a way that it may inspire further research on surface modifications during medical treatment. The present review may help prospective investigators understand the importance of surface modifications for obtaining excellent implantation performance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are benign, blood-filled neoplasms causing bone destruction, often requiring en bloc resection. However, challenges arise, especially at the cranio-cervical junction, where proximity to critical structures limits en bloc removal. Non-surgical options include selective arterial embolization (SAE) as main treatment, while Denosumab and centrifugated bone marrow emerge as experimental alternatives. We report a case of C2 ABC in a young woman successfully treated with a single injection of biphasic ceramic bone substitute (BCBS) containing hydroxyapatite (HA) and calcium sulfate. CASE DESCRIPTION: En bloc resection was deemed unnecessary due to the absence of neurological deficits or deformities, as reported throughout literature evidences. Denosumab administration showed interval tumor change, while SAE was hindered by arterial anastomosis, limiting the possibility of obtaining complete embolization, while significantly increasing cerebral ischemic risks. Repeated intralesional iliac crest bone marrow injection proved ineffective. Subsequently, a single BCBS injection was attempted. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed complete cyst ossification, cortical bone remodeling without artifacts, and spinal canal restoration. CONCLUSIONS: HA and calcium sulfate BCBS vertebroplasty emerges as a promising alternative to SAE and denosumab when surgery is not indicated or feasible. Its benefits include effectiveness after a single injection, complete ossification, cortical bone restoration, and artifact-free imaging. These features make it valuable also in cases of pathological fractures."

Intra-arterial administration of particulates labeled with beta-emitting radionuclides is one of the non-surgical promising modalities for the treatment of liver cancer. METHODS: In this work, the radiation absorbed dose of 166Ho-hydroxyapatite (166Ho-HA) radiopharmaceutical was estimated for adult men based on biodistribution data in normal Wistar rats. The MIRD dose calculation method and the Sparks and Aydogan methodology were applied. RESULTS: The results show that more than 84% of the absorbed dose is localized in liver tissue (7.35 mGy MBq-1). Also, radiation absorbed doses of 166Ho-HA for red bone marrow, osteogenic cells, and spleen tissues were estimated to be about 0.18, 0.38, and 0.24 mGy MBq-1, respectively. The maximum administrated activity was obtained at 87.5 MBq kg-1 of body weight with an effective dose of 0.39 mSv MBq-1. The maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for liver tissue was 6.13 GBq (165.56 mCi).

We determined the mean length and volume of these teeth in dogs in the weight ranges of 1-5 kg, 5-10 kg, 10-20 kg, and over 20 kg. The obtained values given showed a correlation between tooth length and alveolar volume in a specific weight range. A review of the commercially available hydroxyapatite-based bone substitute materials was then conducted. A table is presented which shows how to calculate the volume of bone substitute material required to fill a post-extraction alveolus with a given material. Statistics were used to assess significant differences between the mass of the bone substitute product used (μL) for specific weight ranges and to demonstrate the correlation between tooth length and alveolar volume for a specific weight range. The data obtained in this study can serve as reference values for tooth crown length and alveolar volume, allowing operators to plan a specific volume of bone substitute material for filling post-extraction alveoli. This research is interesting because it shows that the weight of an animal is an important aspect in planning the amount of bone substitute material for tooth extraction. In clinical work, it is much easier to weigh an animal than it is to make calculations based on the length of the tooth root."

      "abstract": "Modern dentistry is turning towards natural sources to overcome the immunological, toxicological, aesthetic, and durability drawbacks of synthetic materials. Among the first biomaterials used as endosseous dental implants, mollusk shells also display unique features, such as high mechanical strength, superior toughness, hierarchical architecture, and layered, microporous structure. This review focusses on hydroxyapatite-a bioactive, osteoconductive, calcium-based material crucial for bone healing and regeneration. Mollusk-derived hydroxyapatite is widely available, cost-effective, sustainable, and a low-impact biomaterial. Thermal treatment coupled with wet chemical precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis are the most common methods used for its recovery since they provide efficiency, scalability, and the ability to produce highly crystalline and pure resulting materials. Several factors, such as temperature, pH, and sintering parameters, modulate the size, purity, and crystallinity of the final product. Experimental and clinical data support that mollusk shell-derived hydroxyapatite and its carbonated derivatives, especially their nanocrystaline forms, display notable bioactivity, osteoconductivity, and osteoinductivity without causing adverse immune reactions. These biomaterials are therefore highly relevant for specific dental applications, such as bone graft substitutes or dental implant coatings. However, continued research and clinical validation is needed to optimize the synthesis of mollusk shell-derived hydroxyapatite and determine its applicability to regenerative dentistry and beyond."

      "abstract": "Clinically, infectious bone defects represent a significant threat, leading to osteonecrosis, severely compromising patient prognosis, and prolonging hospital stays. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a bone graft substitute that combines broad-spectrum antibacterial efficacy and bone-inductive properties, providing an effective treatment option for infectious bone defects. In this study, the precision of digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technology was utilized to construct a scaffold, incorporating zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) modified barium titanate (BT) with hydroxyapatite (HA), resulting in a piezoelectric ceramic scaffold designed for the repair of infected bone defects. The results indicated that the addition of ZnO-NPs significantly improved the piezoelectric properties of BT, facilitating a higher HA content within the ceramic scaffold system, which is essential for bone regeneration. In vitro antibacterial assessments highlighted the scaffold's potent antibacterial capabilities. Moreover, combining the synergistic effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) and piezoelectricity, results demonstrated that the scaffold promoted notable osteogenic and angiogenic potential, enhancing bone growth and repair. Furthermore, transcriptomics analysis results suggested that the early growth response-1 (EGR1) gene might be crucial in this process. This study introduces a novel method for constructing piezoelectric ceramic scaffolds exhibiting outstanding osteogenic, angiogenic, and antibacterial properties under the combined influence of LIPUS, offering a promising treatment strategy for infectious bone defects."

The results confirmed the successful integration of Sm3+ ions into the hydroxyapatite. Our findings revealed the influence of the Sm3+ content and thermal treatment on the emission properties, obtaining a maximum emission at Sm = 0.05 thermally treated at 800 °C. The SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell viability study revealed a Sm3+ concentration-and particle size-dependent response.

      "abstract": "Comminuted fractures associated with tissue loss can adversely affect bone regeneration. Biomaterials enriched with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) employed for supporting osteosynthesis and potentiating osteoconduction are necessary to fill these bone defects. Natural compound biomaterials, similar to bone tissue, have been extensively tested in animal models for clinical use. Bone tissue engineering studies have used critical-size defects in ovine tibia monitored by imaging and histological examinations to evaluate the regenerative process. This study aimed to monitor the regenerative process in ovine tibial defects with or without chitosan, carbon nanotubes, or hydroxyapatite biomaterials, enriched or not enriched with MSCs. A 3-cm ostectomy was performed in 18 female Suffolk sheep. A 10-hole 4.5 mm narrow locking compression plate was used for osteosynthesis. The animals were randomly divided into three groups (n = 6): control (CON); defects filled with chitosan, carbon nanotubes, and hydroxyapatite biomaterial (BIO); and the same biomaterial enriched with bone marrow MSCs (BIO + CELL). The animals were evaluated monthly using radiographic examinations until 90 postoperative days, when they were euthanized. The limbs were subjected to micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and bone specimens were subjected to histological evaluations. The radiographic examinations revealed construction stability without plate deviation, fracture, or bone lysis. Micro-CT evaluation demonstrated a difference in bone microarchitecture between the CON and biomaterial treatment groups (BIO and BIO + CELL). In the histological evaluations, the CON group did not demonstrate bone formation, and in the treatment groups (BIO and BIO + CELL), biocompatibility with sheep tissue was noted, and bone formation with trabeculae interspersed with remnants of the biomaterial was observed, with no differences between the groups. In conclusion, biomaterials present osteoconduction with beneficial characteristics for filling bone-lost fractures, and MSCs did not interfere with bone formation.",

This issue is exacerbated in countries with high aquaculture production and inefficient fish scale (FS) utilization. This study prepared and compared highly crystalline hydroxyapatite (HAp) from the FS of an anadromous fish, Tenualosa ilisha (I-HAp), and a freshwater fish, Labeo rohita (R-HAp). Acid-alkali treatment followed by high-temperature calcination was employed for HAp synthesis. XRD analysis indicated a monoclinic crystal structure for I-HAp and a hexagonal structure for R-HAp, with both containing β-TCP as a secondary phase. Rietveld refinement quantified β-TCP at 8% for I-HAp and 7.2% for R-HAp. Crystallite size of the samples was estimated by various methods (Scherrer's method, Scherrer equation average method, linear straight-line method, straight line passing the origin method, Monshi-Scherrer method, Halder-Wagner method, Williamson-Hall method, and size-strain plot method), consistently indicating microcrystalline HAp. FESEM and TEM analyses revealed larger particle sizes for I-HAp, confirmed by DLS measurements. Surface elemental analysis by XPS confirmed the presence of Na and Mg as impurities along with the elements of the HAp structure. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy identified expected functional groups, while EDX determined elemental composition. Both HAp samples exhibited bioactivity through apatite layer formation in simulated body fluid. Furthermore, the combined results of the cell viability and hemocompatibility studies indicate the biocompatibility of the prepared samples."

In this paper, the authors deposited HAp synthetic microparticles by means of matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) on Ti6Al4V alloy plate substrates and obtained uniform HAp coatings without further treatment or modifications. The authors utilized a tunable pulsed laser to adjust its wavelength to the selected solvents, in order to optimize the process for deposition speed and quality. The following solvents were used as matrices: deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, and a 3:2 mixture of isopropanol:acetonitrile. Obtained coatings were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and profilometry in order to evaluate coating quality, uniformity, and structural integrity. MAPLE deposition allowed the acquisition of approx. 200 nm thick coatings for water and isopropanol matrices and approx. 320 nm for isopropanol:acetonitrile matrix, which indicates an increase in deposition rate by 37%. The obtained coatings meet requirements for further biocompatibility testing, material modification, and composite synthesis."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experimental toothpastes were prepared with different concentrations of nano-HAp (5% nano-HAp, 10% nano-HAp) and a fixed concentration of basil leaf extract (5% extract). 24 bovine tooth enamel samples were divided into 4 treatment groups. After 6 days of pH cycling, surface microhardness was tested using Vickers Microhardness Test and microporosity was observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The pitting diffusion method was used to test the antibacterial activity of toothpaste against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. RESULTS: Enamel surface microhardness showed an increase with increasing nano-HAp concentration, while fluoride toothpaste showed the highest level of surface microhardness. Microporosity observation showed the disappearance of microporosity as nano-HAp concentration increased, while fluoride toothpaste still left microporosity. Antibacterial activity of the toothpaste showed that the mean inhibition zone of each group was not significantly different with a very strong inhibition zone. CONCLUSIONS: Rice snail shell nano-HAp toothpaste combined with 5% basil leaf extract is effective as a remineralizing agent by reducing the level of tooth enamel microporosity but cannot match 1450 ppm fluoride toothpaste in increasing surface hardness. In addition, nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste of paddy field snail shell combined with 5% basil leaf extract is effective as an antibacterial agent for preventing dental caries because it has antibacterial activity equivalent to 1450 ppm fluoride herbal toothpaste.

Using confocal imaging and RT-PCR analysis, our results showed effective gene delivery and expression in both mouse myotubes and patient-derived cells, with sustained expression evident up to 5 days post transfection.

The synthesized Ss/nHAp was subjected to characterization using various techniques, including XRD, XPS, FTIR, Raman, BET, FESEM etc. in order to understand the material thoroughly. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to establish the optimal conditions for removing the dye, considering variables such as adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH and initial dye concentration. 85% of the CR dye was eliminated within a short span of 10 minutes using a minimal adsorbent dose of 0.1 g, under neutral pH and room temperature, showcasing its efficiency. The adsorption process adhered to pseudo second order kinetics and was best fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model, with a maximum adsorption capacity (q max) of 24 mg g-1. The material's reusability was demonstrated through regeneration studies, with efficiency slightly decreasing to 74% by the fifth cycle due to adsorbent loss. This study establishes Ss/nHAp as a low-cost, eco-friendly, and effective adsorbent for dye-contaminated water treatment, paving the way for future applications in industrial wastewater remediation."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Precursors for the study include di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, with sodium hydrogen carbonate added to achieve different levels of carbonate substitution. The synthesized CHA samples are characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe morphology. For 14 days at 37°C, samples were submerged in simulated body fluid to assess their mineral induction capabilities. SEM was used to confirm apatite formation on sample surfaces. The cytotoxicity assay was used to assess the vitality of the cells following their exposure to various concentrations of CHA. RESULTS: The Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards data for HA aligned well with the results from X-ray diffraction analysis of CHA across 3 different concentrations, indicating strong agreement. Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated the presence of phosphate, hydroxyl, and carbonate groups within the samples. SEM and Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis show agglomerated and flaky nanoparticles. All the samples are bioactive, but the formation of apatite differs from one another. In vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that over 70% of cells maintain viability. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study may provide insight into the potential use of carbonated HA as a dental pulp-capping material for vital pulp therapy."

Forty Wistar albino rats, with an average weight of 200-220 g, aged 16-18 weeks, and all male, were used in the study. The rats were randomly assigned to five groups, each containing 8 rats, as follows: group C1 (no procedure applied to the mandible), group C2 (surgical defect created in the mandible but no treatment applied), group nHA (nano hydroxyapatite applied to the surgical defect area), group nHA + B1 (nano hydroxyapatite + 1% boron applied to the surgical defect area), and group nHA + B2 (nano hydroxyapatite + 2% boron applied to the surgical defect area). A standard 4 × 4 mm full-thickness transosseous bone defect was created in the mandibular corpus of all rats, except for those in group C1. The bone defect in the rats in group C2 was left to heal naturally. Nano hydroxyapatite (nHA), nano hydroxyapatite + 1% boron, and nano hydroxyapatite + 2% boron were applied to the surgical defect areas of the other three groups, respectively. Bone scintigraphy was performed on all rats on days 0 (following the surgical procedure) and 28 of the experimental period. At the end of the 28th day, the animals were sacrificed, and tissue samples were collected for histological examination. A standard grading system was used to evaluate fracture healing. When the groups were compared in terms of bone healing histopathological scores, a statistically significant difference was observed between group C1 and the other groups (p < 0.005). In the statistical evaluation made according to the histopathological mean scores, the least improvement was observed in group C2. No statistically significant difference was observed between group nHA and group nHA + B1 and group C2 and between group nHA and group nHA + B1 in terms of bone healing scores (p > 0.005). A statistically significant difference was found between group nHA + B2 and group C2 (p = 0.026). Although there was no statistically significant difference in histopathological scores, the mean score closest to group C1 was observed in group nHA + B2. A statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in the scintigraphic evaluation performed on the 28th day of the experimental procedure, and the difference was between group C1 and group nHA + B1 and between group nHA and group nHA + B1 (p = 0.004; p = 0.028, p < 0.005). In the comparison of the values obtained on days 0 and 28 within the group, a statistically significant change was observed in group nHA + B1 and group nHA + B2 (p < 0.005). When the results of the present study were evaluated, it was thought that the boron-doped nHA graft biomaterials may have positive effects on bone healing. Providing a different perspective for the development of an alternative new treatment modality that can be locally applied in the treatment of fractures a serious and common health problem can be interpreted as an important outcome of the present study. We believe that this study will serve as a preliminary study for more comprehensive future studies on this subject."

      "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy has been recognized as a viable approach for lung cancer treatment. Some photosensitizer agents are known as X-ray sensitive and could improve radiotherapy efficacy. The use of nanoparticles for drug delivery and as photosensitizer agents offers various advantages because of their rapid cellular accumulation and distribution into target organs. On the other hand, several nanoparticles could trigger adverse effects during cancer treatment. In this article, the biological study of hydroxyapatite zirconium nanoparticles (HApZr) as photosensitizer candidates for X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. This nanoparticle increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels after the delivery of ionizing radiation at 5 Gy to a cancer cell line and showed higher cytotoxicity compared to non-irradiated treatment. In vitro cellular uptake based on cell imaging also indicated a promising intake and an ability to kill cancer cells. Subsequently, an in vivo evaluation using orthotopic lung cancer mouse models also showed their good accumulation in target organs, with lower accumulation in normal lung tissue. Moreover, studies of acute toxicity showed that a dose of 50 μg/mL yielded minor pathological changes on histological evaluations, which were supported by a biochemical analysis. In addition, HApZr nanoparticles also increase TNF-α which enhancing the cytotoxic effect after irradiation. Finally, these findings were important for further investigation of the clinical application of these HApZr nanoparticles for the treatment of patients with lung cancer.",

      "abstract": "An acute wound is the most common type of skin injury. Developing wound dressings with excellent mechanical properties, wound protection, comfort, angiogenic capacity and therapeutic effects is significant for effective treatments, yet remains challenging. Herein, we have designed a novel HAP-Alg composite dressing comprising a complementary ultralong hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanowire bio-paper and calcium alginate hydrogel. The HAP bio-paper assembled by ultralong HAP nanowires, in contrast to typical brittle HAP bio-ceramics, exhibits a highly flexible and interwoven structure to enhance the mechanical and protective performance of an alginate hydrogel, and the alginate matrix creates a moist environment for skin regeneration. Therefore, the HAP-Alg composite dressing presents good mechanical properties and high resistance to swelling and shrinkage, along with a reliable bacterial shielding ability. In addition, its moisturizing effect can deliver bioactive calcium ions to promote angiogenesis, accelerate re-epithelialization and reduce scar formation. In vitro studies reveal that the HAP-Alg composite dressing has excellent biocompatibility, promotes cell migration and angiogenesis, and enhances calcium ion influx. In vivo wound models further prove the ability of the HAP-Alg composite dressing to accelerate wound closure, enhance collagen deposition, and induce neovascularization. This work demonstrates that the HAP-Alg composite dressing offers a promising wound dressing for acute wound treatment and protection.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate that the ColII-HA-CS-HAP scaffolds with BMSCs could repair cartilage defects of knee. METHODS: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were extracted from rabbits, identified using immunofluorescence staining, and successfully induced into chondrocytes. Type II collagen (ColII) was isolated from bovine cartilage and constructed into scaffolds with hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and hydroxyapatite. Then BMSCs were seeded on the ColII-HA-CS-HAP scaffold to detect biocompatibility. RESULTS: The results of DAPI fluorescence staining showed that the number of BMSCs on the ColII-HA-CS-HAP scaffolds increased rapidly after culturing for 12 d. The rabbit knee cartilage defect model with a diameter of approximately 3 mm and a thickness of approximately 4 mm was selected to evaluate the regenerative potential of the scaffolds using histological and immunohistochemical analyses. At 6 months, the regenerated cartilage in the ColII-HA-CS-HAP scaffolds with BMSCs was more similar to that of native cartilage than the ColII-HA-CS-HAP scaffold group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study proved that the ColII-HA-CS-HAP scaffolds with differentiated BMSCs can produce an excellent healing response and repair cartilage defects successfully in a rabbit model.",

      "abstract": "Biological hydroxyapatite (BHA) is widely used in the treatment of clinical bone defects due to its good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. The clinical application of mateiral size is based on the principle of bone defect area adaptation, which contributes to diversity of BHA sizes. However, different sizes correspond to different hierarchical levels of bone biomimicry. As the size changes, the bone biomimicry hierarchy evolves accordingly and influences the process of bone repair and regeneration through osteo-coagulo-immunomodulation, leading to unstable bone graft outcomes. Therefore, this paper reviews the size effect of clinical BHA, analyzes the multilevel structure of natural bone, proposes the evolution of bone biomimetic hierarchy triggered by the size of BHA, and further analyzes the size-media-ted osteo-coagulo-immunomodulation. Based on the hierarchical levels of bone and its osteo-coagulo-immunomodulation effect, we provide a new understanding of the biological principle of the size effect of biomaterials and a theoretical basis for the basic research and clinical application of different size BHA materials.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteomyelitis is a challenging condition caused by infection and inflammation of the bone, presenting a significant economic burden to healthcare systems. Calcium sulfate/hydroxyapatite (CaS/HA) is a bone void filler composed of 60% calcium sulfate and 40% hydroxyapatite. This case series aimed to report the efficacy and infection-related outcomes of CaS/HA combined with Gentamicin (CaS/HA-G) in treating osteomyelitis. METHODS: Patients aged 18 and older diagnosed with osteomyelitis requiring surgical intervention and treated with CaS/HA-G during their procedure were included in the study, with a median (Q1-Q3) = 10 (7-16)-month follow-up period of time. Data collected included demographic, surgical, and outcome information. Infection eradication was determined by the normalization of the C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels, or the absence of clinical infection symptoms. RESULTS: The case series involved 21 patients (twelve male, nine female) with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (16.6) years. Vancomycin or/and Tobramycin were used as an additional antibiotic in 17 patients. At the last follow-up, 20 out of 21 patients (95.2%) had eradicated the infection, with a median (Q1-Q3) eradication time of 128 (71.8-233.5) days. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that CaS/HA-G is effective in controlling osseous infection in osteomyelitis while acting as an absorbable bone void filler."

However, the efficacy of such treatments is increasingly compromised by the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, underscoring an urgent need for innovative approaches. This study introduces a novel composite material designed to offer dual functionality: robust antimicrobial activity and promotion of bone regeneration. The composite integrates biocompatible hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HA) with a titanium(IV)-metal-organic framework, MIL-125(Ti)-NH2, impregnated with gentamicin (GM). The solvothermally synthesized MIL-125-NH2@HA composite demonstrates high cytocompatibility, as evidenced by assays using osteoblasts (U2-OS) and fibroblasts (L929), alongside an absence of hemolytic activity at concentrations of up to 1000 μg/mL. Importantly, the introduction of GM into the composite significantly amplifies its antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additionally, nanoindentation assessments reveal enhanced mechanical properties of the MIL-125-NH2@HA composite, indicating the superior elastic performance relative to unmodified HA. The findings of this research are poised to generate significant interest in the development of metal-organic framework (MOF)-based composites for antimicrobial implant applications, presenting a promising avenue for addressing the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance in bone infections.",

      "abstract": "Bioreactor can provide a dynamic culture environment for the in vitro construction of osteochondral tissue engineering. They facilitate more efficient exchange of nutrients and provide mechanical and other beneficial stimulation. Previous findings demonstrated that rotary flask (RF) bioreactor, rotary cell culture system (RCCS), or electromagnetic field (EMF) mediated scaffold culture could create a favorable dynamic environment for osteochondral tissue engineering. However, it is still unclear whether there is an optimal bioreactor or if bioreactors under multi-parameter coupling conditions are conducive to osteochondral tissue engineering. Based on this, the application of static T-flask (TF), RF, RCCS, and coupling environment of RCCS and EMF for osteochondral tissue engineering were systematically compared. The results showed that the RCCS/EMF culture system achieved the highest level of cellular proliferation and directed differentiation. Compared with the static culture group, the expression levels of chondrogenic factors of Sox9, Col II, and ACAN and osteogenic factors of Runx2, OCN, and Col I in RCCS/EMF culture system were 2.90 ± 0.10, 3.53 ± 0.05, 3.15 ± 0.08, 7.16 ± 0.15, 5.01 ± 0.21 and 3.99 ± 0.17 folds, respectively. The 'Active osteochondral' constructs (The construct is composed of chitosan/gelatin/nano-hydroxyapatite and bone-derived scaffolds) were prepared under different culture modes in vitro and implanted into the femoral condylar defect of New Zealand rabbits. After 12 weeks, all culture modes could effectively promote the repair of osteochondral defects, in which the RCCS/EMF intervention had the best effect on the in vivo in-situ repair of osteochondral tissues. Furthermore, the fabricated cartilage and subchondral bone in the RCCS/EMF treatment group were most similar to the surrounding natural tissues, providing a new therapeutic idea for osteochondral tissue engineering.",

Customized hydroxyapatite porous ceramics are an excellent option for covering skull bone defects. The authors illustrate the surgical technique and investigate the effectiveness of the \"one-step\" procedure in terms of aesthetic results and early degree of osteointegration. METHOD: A prospective study was conducted, including all patients operated on for skull bone infiltrating lesions at our center between January 2020 and June 2022. Stereolithography was the technique used for shaping the epoxy-resin model, suitable for both designing the craniotomy and manufacturing the custom-made hydroxyapatite prosthesis. Clinical outcome, results of early (6-week) and late (3-month) osteointegration evaluated on CT and MRI, and level of patient satisfaction measured by the FACE-Q questionnaire were reported. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (13 adults and a 7-year-old boy) and a total of 15 implants were included. The average percentage of early osteointegration calculated at the edge of the prosthesis, was 72.2%, that increased to 82.6% after 3 months. Patient-reported outcomes indicated a high level of satisfaction across all patients. CONCLUSIONS: \"One-step\" resection and reconstruction using customized hydroxyapatite porous implants for treatment of skull infiltrating tumors is a safe, simple and effective technique, in particular when the bone defect is large. Bone regeneration around and inside the prosthesis seems to start early after surgery.",

Early detection of lesions is crucial, with non-invasive methods preferred in the initial stages of caries for enamel remineralization and demineralization prevention. This study aimed to assess the impact of varying contents of boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite on the microhardness of demineralized enamel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composites at concentrations of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% were prepared using the sol-gel method. Thirty intact human premolars were collected to evaluate tooth remineralization. The teeth were divided into buccal and lingual halves, subjected to pH cycling for 14 days to demineralize the enamel surface. Subsequently, the specimens were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15) based on the application of remineralizing materials: Group 1 - Hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite (HApC); Group 2 - Boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite (B@HApC) with 5% boron concentration; Group 3 - Boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite (B@HApC) with 10% boron concentration; and Group 4 - Boron-doped hydroxyapatite-chitosan nano-composite (B@HApC) with 15% boron concentration. Microhardness was measured at three points using a Vickers hardness test (300 g force for 10 s). RESULTS: The study revealed a significant difference between the nano-composite groups containing 5%, 10%, and 15% boron compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The highest microhardness was observed in the 15% boron group (49.42), with the control group showing the lowest microhardness (20.15). Pairwise comparisons of microhardness indicated a significant difference between Group 4 and the control group (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found between Groups 2 and 3, Groups 2 and 4, and Groups 3 and 4 (p > 0.05). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results supported the microhardness findings, showing a mineral layer covering the porous structure resulting from enamel surface demineralization in the intervention groups, highlighting the effectiveness of boron in enhancing the microhardness of demineralized enamel. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that a content of 15% boron in B@HApC and higher led to increased microhardness of demineralized enamel. Additionally, content of 5% and 10% boron in the nano-composite also improved microhardness, although not to a statistically significant extent.",

Herein we report the synthesis of 1 mmol/gcat of urea with a selectivity of 97 % under strictly mild conditions (95-120 °C and 1 bar of CO2; without applying any electrical currents or UV irradiation) which represents an efficiency of ~2 % and ~30 % with respect to the NH3 and CO2 content, respectively. The study of the NH3 content, products adsorbed in the catalyst, presence of intermediates and temperature of the reaction allows unveiling the great potential of upp-HAp as a green catalyst for sustainable Bazarov reactions. Results suggest that the double-step approach could be more advantageous for both synthesizing urea and as a CO2-revalorization strategy, which in turn promotes the development of specific technologies for the independent synthesis of green NH3."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis is a significant public health concern due to its association with fragility fractures. Despite experiencing such fractures, many patients remain at high risk of future fractures due to inadequate management and treatment of their underlying osteoporosis. This research presents a comprehensive intervention to enhance osteoporosis management in patients with fragility fractures. The intervention involves a thorough personalized assessment of fracture risk using clinical factors and bone density testing, followed by customized treatment based on the individual's fracture risk level. It also addresses non-compliance through patient education, counseling, reminders, and improved care coordination among acute, primary, and specialty providers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim is to create and characterize sodium alginate/hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds reinforced with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) for bone tissue engineering. Freeze-drying was used to produce scaffolds with 0-15% ZnO-NP. Analyses confirmed the composite structure, uniform ZnO-NP distribution, and decreasing pore size with higher ZnO-NP content. Mechanical testing showed increased compressive strength with greater ZnO-NP. RESULTS: The scaffolds exhibited over 70% porosity, neutral pH, and increased apatite deposition and bioactivity with higher ZnO-NP. They also demonstrated decreased swelling and strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, making them a promising candidate for bone regeneration. CONCLUSION: Additionally, the researchers used an artificial neural network (ANN) to better understand the relationships between various scaffold properties, and the ANN-based predictions showed that changes in pore size and porosity affect the other properties, with acceptable error compared to experimental results."

      "abstract": "The solid-state reaction between a stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (HA) and CuO at temperatures above 1100 °C produces pure Cux-HA phases for x ≤ 0.7 with the general formula Ca10CuIx(PO4)6(OH)2-xOx. The Cu atoms are located at the center of the hexagonal tunnels between two hydroxyl ligands, as determined by Fourier analysis based on XRD data. During heat treatment, the reduction of Cu2+ ions into Cu+ is concomitant with the stabilization of copper in HA in the hexagonal tunnel. The incorporation of monovalent copper within the apatite, as revealed by XANES spectroscopy, explains the violet color of the samples. The incorporation of Cu+ ions, by substitution of a hydrogen atom by copper(I), results in the formation of linear O-Cu-O chains where the majority of which are isolated for x ≤ 0.3. In addition, the EXAFS investigation showed, thanks to the linear geometry of these clusters that results in multiple diffusion effects, the existence of [CuO]n chains with n ≥ 2, which only appear clearly for higher copper contents x ≥ 0.5. The strong covalency of the Cu-O bond in such a dumbbell configuration would lead to strong hybridization between the 3d and 4s orbitals of copper and the 2p orbitals of oxygen, as illustrated by ESR signals. In the case of Cu-doped HA prepared by coprecipitation and annealed at a lower temperature (T ≤ 600 °C), copper substitutes calcium according to the theoretical formula Ca10-xCux(PO4)6(OH)2, mainly at the Ca(2) site. This local environment is in line with the Jahn-Teller distortion induced by the Cu2+ ion (as evidenced by UV-vis-NIR, XPS, and XANES-EXAFS spectroscopy analyses) and also allows copper-copper interactions from one site to another, as observed by ESR spectroscopy. This versatility of copper in HA gives it optical properties that change from a violet color with near-IR absorption to a blue hue. In all cases, Cu-O-Cu interactions persist whatever the valence state, and heat treatment induces a redox phenomenon, with copper exchanging between two sites close to each other."

      "abstract": "The remediation of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soil using biochar (BC) derived from agricultural and forestry waste has gained significant attention due to its ability to convert active soil Cd components to stable forms, reduce bioavailability, decrease Cd absorption by pepper plants, and enhance the nutritional benefits of soil. However, there is limited research on the effects of different passivating agents on soil Cd during various growth stages (seedling, flowering, and maturity) of peppers. In this study, we investigated the cyclic changes in soil physicochemical properties, Cd chemical forms, and their effects on pepper growth by applying different biochar-supported nano-hydroxyapatite. Our results revealed a decreasing trend in the physical and chemical indicators of soil during the flowering stage, following an initial peak. Notably, in the mature stage, the application of nBC3 at an 11 % mass ratio significantly reduced soil Cd content by 57.6 % and fixed it by 77 %. This treatment also increased soil Cd by 48.1 % compared with the control (CK, without any treatment) and reduced its accumulation in the pepper plant by 36.6 %. pH, organic matter, and phosphorus were identified as the main factors influencing Cd fixation in the soil. These findings showed that the in situ application of nBC3 composite material throughout the entire cultivation cycle effectively remediated Cd-contaminated soil and enhanced the quality of agricultural products. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of passivating agents on soil Cd dynamics and offers a theoretical basis for practical remediation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Improving the adsorption efficiency of porous adsorbent materials for organic liquids with high viscosity is crucial for addressing oil spill incidents. In this study, a high-performance aerogel adsorbent composed of polyimide (PI), hydroxyapatite nanowires (HAPnws), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been fabricated, which leverages reduced flow tortuosity through anisotropic structures and solar-assisted viscosity reduction via photothermal materials. The prepared anisotropic PI/HAP/rGO aerogel, with directional channels, shows unique mechanical properties with high stiffness along the axial direction and compressibility along the radial direction. PI/HAP/rGO, featuring vertically aligned channels, demonstrated superior adsorption efficiency (the adsorption coefficient K s reached 0.37 kg m-1 s-1/2 for an engine oil with a viscosity of ~144 mPa·s) for oil of varying viscosities compared to similar aerogels with uniform pores, because of the substantially reduced flow tortuosity. The photothermal properties of rGO further enhance the adsorption speed of PI/HAP/rGO for viscous oil under sunlight, including crude oil with ultrahigh viscosity. In addition, PI/HAP/rGO exhibits excellent fire resistance, allowing for reusability via both adsorption-compression and adsorption-combustion cycles. The robust and compressible PI/HAP/rGO aerogels with high adsorption efficiency for viscous oil and fire resistance represent an ideal solution for practical oil spill treatment, and this approach also offers inspiration for the development of advanced adsorbent materials."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to update our 3-year-old meta-analysis to include RCTs, in vivo, and in situ clinical evidence that showed hydroxyapatite in oral care products can reduce dental caries. DATA: Using the PICO guide, published clinical trials were searched where subjects (P) of all ages, with primary, mixed or permanent dentitions, using toothpastes, mouthwashes or gels containing hydroxyapatite as an active ingredient (I) were compared to subjects who used placebo or no intervention, or fluoride-containing positive controls (C), and the outcomes (O) were direct measurement of reduced dental caries or suitable proxy for reduced caries risk. SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched using search terms from previous searches. STUDY SELECTION: All authors collectively agreed which studies to include after applying the exclusion/inclusion criteria. Eighteen studies were retrieved and analyzed. The studies were graded according to a National Institutes of Health grading system. Three authors decided on the final list of publications suitable for meta-analysis, and the meta-analysis was carried out using the public domain R statistical program. RESULTS: After applying more specific inclusion criteria and assessment, out of 18 retrieved studies, 5 clinical trials and 8 in situ trials were included in the meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for the effectiveness of fluoride-free, hydroxyapatite-containing oral care products in reducing dental caries, both from RCTs and in situ clinical trials, has expanded. More studies now show that hydroxyapatite is effective as an anti-caries active ingredient in the absence of fluoride. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: As a sole active ingredient, considered safe if swallowed, hydroxyapatite is an ideal substitute for fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash tailored for young children, and new data as presented in this review, demonstrated that hydroxyapatite-based oral care products can be used by people of all ages.",

      "abstract": "In this work, composite materials were obtained for the first time using various methods and the dependences of the resulting surface morphologies were investigated. This involves modifying the surface with cucurbit[n]urils, which are highly promising macrocyclic compounds. The process includes applying cucurbit[6]uril to the hydroxyapatite surface in water using different modification techniques. The first method involved precipitating a dispersion of CB[6] in undissolved form in water. The second method involved using fully dissolved CB[6] in deionized water, after which the composite materials were dried to constant weight. The third method involved several steps: first, CB[6] was dissolved in deionized water, then, upon heating, a dispersion of CB[6] was formed on the surface of HA. The fourth method involved using ultrasonic treatment. All four methods yielded materials with different surface morphologies, which were studied and characterized using techniques such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on these results, it is possible to vary the properties and surface morphology of the obtained materials. Depending on the method of applying CB[6] to the surface and inside the HA scaffold, it is possible to adjust the composition and structure of the target composite materials. The methods for applying CB[6] to the hydroxyapatite surface enhance its versatility and compatibility with the body's environment, which is crucial for developing new functional composite materials. This includes leveraging supramolecular systems based on the CB[n] family. The obtained results can be used to model the processes of obtaining biocomposite materials, as well as to predict the properties of future materials with biological activity."

      "abstract": "Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a bioceramic material widely used as a bone biomimetic substitute and can be synthesized by biomineralization, according to which HA nanoparticles are formed on a polymer template. Nevertheless, little is known about the effect of ion doping and biomineralization on cell metabolism, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. In the present contribution, we report on synthesizing and characterizing biomineralized chitosan as a polymer template with HA nanoparticles doped with magnesium (MgHA) and iron ions (FeHA). The physical-chemical and morphological characterization confirmed the successful synthesis of low crystalline ions-doped HA nanoparticles on the chitosan template, whereas the biochemical activity of the resulting nanoparticles towards human osteoblasts-like cells (MG63 and HOBIT) was investigated considering their effect on cell metabolism, proliferation, colony formation, redox status, and DNA damage extent. Data obtained suggest that particles enhance cell metabolism but partially limit cell proliferation. The redox status of cells was measured suggesting a slight increase in Reactive Oxygen Species production with chitosan biomineralized with iron-doped HA, whereas no effect with magnesium-doped HA and no effect of all formulations on the oxidation level of Peroxiredoxin. On the other hand, DNA damage was investigated by COMET assay, and expression and foci γH2AX. These latter tests indicated that HA-based nanoparticles promote DNA damage which is enhanced by chitosan thus suggesting that chitosan favors the nanoparticles' internalization by cells and modulates their biological activity. The potential DNA damage should be considered - and potentially exploited for instance in anticancer treatment - when HA-based particles are used to devise biomaterials."

In this work, we propose the use of iodine-substituted hydroxyapatite (IHAP) nanomaterials to use iodine (127I) as a proton radiation tracer, providing access to range verification studies in mineralized tissues. For this purpose, the nanomaterials were synthesized at four iodine concentrations via hydrothermal synthesis. The materials were characterized via different microstructural techniques to identify an optimal high iodine concentration and pure apatite phase nanomaterial. Finally, such pure IHAP powders were shaped and irradiated with proton beams of 6 and 10 MeV, and their activation was demonstrated through subsequent decay analysis. The materials could be integrated into phantom structures for the verification of doses and ranges of protons prior to animal testing and clinical proton therapy treatments of tumors located deep under combined soft and calcified tissues.",
