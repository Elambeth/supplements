      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory gynecologic disease characterized by the abnormal implantation of endometrial tissue outside the uterus. The inflammatory microenvironment of endometriosis is dominated by highly migratory endometriotic cells, inflammatory cells, and cytokines. There is no curative treatment other than oral contraceptives, painkillers, and surgery. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an anti-inflammatory compound has been identified as a promising agent for endometriosis. However, it is still unclear how NAC interacts with interferon-gamma (IFN-ɣ) and common cytokines in the endometriotic microenvironment. This study aimed to investigate the effects of NAC, alone and in combination with IFN-ɣ and major cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-⍺) on endometriotic cells. For this purpose, we performed a real time-dependent cell impedance assay, Annexin V/PI and ER tracking by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and metabolomic assays. Our results offered a new insight into the complex relationship between NAC and IFN-ɣ, both of which reduced endometriotic cells' proliferation, induced ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, NAC and IFN-ɣ, alter the metabolism of endometriotic cells, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings suggest that NAC when combined with IFN-ɣ, has the potential to generate innovative therapeutic modalities for the treatment of endometriosis.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Bone infection is one of the most prevalent complications in orthopedic surgery. This pathology is mostly due to bacterial pathogens, among which S. aureus stands out. The formation of a bacterial biofilm makes systemic treatment with antibiotics ineffective. Herein we propose a nanosystem composed of mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (MBGN) loaded with levofloxacin and functionalized with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), aiming to offer an alternative to current treatments. These nanoparticles would present antibacterial activity able to disintegrate the biofilm and regenerate the peri-implantar osseous tissue. Methods: MBGN of composition 82.5 SiO2-17.5 CaO have been synthesized, loaded with levofloxacin, and functionalized with NAC (MBGN-L-NAC). The antimicrobial activity against mature S. aureus biofilms and bioactivity of the nanosystem have been evaluated, as well as its biocompatibility and ability to promote murine pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 differentiation. Results: MBGNs exhibited high surface areas and radial mesoporosity, allowing up to 23.1% (% w/w) of levofloxacin loading. NAC was covalently bound keeping the mucolytic thiol group, SH, available. NAC and levofloxacin combination enhances the activity against S. aureus by disrupting mature biofilm integrity. This nanosystem was biocompatible with pre-osteoblasts, enhanced their differentiation towards a mature osteoblast phenotype, and promoted bio-mimetic mineralization under in vitro conditions. MBGN-L-NAC nanoparticles induced greater osteogenic response of osteoprogenitor cells through increased alkaline phosphatase expression, increased mineralization, and stimulation of pre-osteoblast nodule formation. Conclusions: MBGN-L-NAC exhibits a more efficient antibacterial activity due to the biofilm disaggregation exerted by NAC, which also contributes to enhance the osteoinductive properties of MBGNs, providing a potential alternative to conventional strategies for the management of bone infections."

      "abstract": "Background: New drug classes and regimens have shortened the treatment duration for drug-resistant tuberculosis, but adverse events (AEs) and organ toxicity remain unacceptably common. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has demonstrated potential in reducing kidney and liver toxicity in other clinical settings, but efficacy in drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment has not been rigorously evaluated. Method: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at Kibong'oto Infectious Diseases Hospital in Tanzania to assess the efficacy of NAC in reducing AEs in patients undergoing rifampin-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis treatment. Participants received an all-oral standardized rifampin-resistant regimen alone, with NAC 900 mg daily, or NAC 900 mg twice daily for 6 months. AEs, severe AEs, and renal and liver toxicity were monitored monthly and classified according to the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease criteria and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Incident ratios and Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to compare group event occurrences. Results: A total of 66 patients (mean age 47 ± 12 years; 80% male) were randomized into three groups of 22. One hundred and fifty-eight AEs were recorded: 52 (33%) in the standard treatment group, 55 (35%) in the NAC 900 mg daily group, and 51 (32%) in the NAC 900 mg twice-daily group (p > 0.99). Severe AEs were observed in four patients in the standard group, two in the NAC 900 mg daily group, and three in the NAC 900 mg twice-daily group. Renal toxicity was more prevalent in the standard treatment group compared to those that received NAC (45% vs. 23%; p = 0.058), with a shorter onset of time to toxicity (χ2 = 3.199; p = 0.074). Liver injury events were rare across all groups. Conclusion: Among Tanzanian adults receiving rifampin-resistant tuberculosis treatment, NAC did not significantly reduce overall AEs but demonstrated important trends in reducing renal toxicity."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in preventing nephrotoxicity in critically ill patients receiving colistin. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled clinical trial, eligible participants receiving colistin were divided into two groups: the drug group (n = 24) and the control group (n = 24). In the drug group, 2 g of NAC was administered intravenously daily for 5 days, simultaneously with colistin. The patients in the control group received only colistin. Serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine clearance (CrCl) at baseline and on each day, and the number of cases of acute kidney injury during the study were recorded. Urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) was determined before the start of treatment and on day 5. The study outcomes were the mortality rate, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and NAG levels. Finally, the values were compared between the groups. FINDINGS: It was found that the 28-day mortality rate (P = 0.540) and length of ICU stay (P = 0.699) were not significantly improved by coadministration of intravenous N-acetylcysteine with colistin. SCr and BUN showed no significant reduction, and there were no changes in CrCl at the end of treatment. The changes in urinary NAG levels did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was also no difference in the stages of the RIFLE criteria (P = 0.641), and most patients were in the normal stage (58.3%). CONCLUSION: Concomitant administration of intravenous NAC at a dose of 2 g daily does not prevent colistin-induced nephrotoxicity, 28-day mortality, and length of ICU stay in critically ill patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has antioxidant properties, on healing in a rat femoral diaphysis fracture model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar-Hannover rats were randomly divided into two groups: experimental (n=12) and control groups (n=12). An open femur fracture model (osteotomy) was applied to the right femora of both groups. Fixation was performed with Kirschner wire. While intraperitoneal NAC treatment was given to the experimental group for 21 days after surgery, an equal volume of intraperitoneal saline injection was administered to the control group. At the end of this period, the femurs obtained from the sacrificed animals were examined histopathologically, radiologically, and biomechanically. Huo scoring was used for histopathological examination. The samples were examined radiologically according to the Radiographic Union Scale in Tibial Fractures (RUST) scoring system. The three-point bending test was used for the biomechanical examination. RESULTS: According to the third-week results, NAC could histopathologically contribute positively to fracture healing in rats (p=0.003 and p<0.05, respectively). Considering radiological and biomechanical parameters, no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of healing (p>0.05). However, a positive significant correlation (67.7%) was found between histopathological results and radiological findings (p=0.016 and p<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study results indicate that NAC may have a histopathologically positive effect on the healing process in rat traumatic fractures. Based on these findings, NAC preparations may be used as a supportive agent in the treatment of fractures. Further clinical studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "Type 4 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS-4) is a pathology in which chronic kidney disease (CKD) triggers the development of cardiovascular disease. CKD pathophysiology produces alterations that can affect the bioenergetics of heart mitochondria, causing oxidative stress and reducing antioxidant glutathione (GSH) levels. GSH depletion alters protein function by affecting post-translational modifications such as S-glutathionylation (RS-SG), exacerbating oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant GSH precursor that modulates oxidative stress and RS-SG. Moreover, recent studies have found that NAC can activate the Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) deacetylase in diseases. However, the role of NAC and its effects on mitochondrial function, redox signaling, and SIRT3 modifications in the heart during CRS-4 have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the role of NAC in mitochondrial function, redox signaling, and SIRT3 in the hearts of animals with CRS-4 at two months of follow-up. Our results showed that the oral administration of NAC (600 mg/kg/day) improved blood pressure and reduced cardiac fibrosis. NACs' protective effect was associated with preserving cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics and decreasing these organelles' hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Additionally, NAC increased GSH levels in heart mitochondria and regulated the redox state, which coincided with an increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized (NAD+) levels and a decrease in mitochondrial acetylated lysines. Finally, NAC increased SIRT3 levels and the activity of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD-2) in the heart. Thus, treatment with NAC decreases mitochondrial alterations, restores redox signaling, and decreases SIRT3 disturbances during CRS-4 through an antioxidant defense mechanism."

      "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a significant cause of testicular damage, leading to infertility and other reproductive dysfunctions. Antioxidant therapies have emerged as a potential intervention to mitigate oxidative stress and cellular damage. This study investigates the effects of somatostatin (SST) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on testicular damage induced by I/R, focusing on their antioxidant and cellular protective effects. Twenty-four male rats were divided into four groups, as follows: sham operated, I/R injury, I/R + somatostatin treatment, and I/R + NAC treatment. A testicular I/R injury was induced surgically, followed by either SST or NAC administration. Testicular tissues were assessed histopathologically using hematoxylin and eosin staining and employing Johnson's biopsy scoring. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed for caspase- 3, 8-hydroxy- 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), testis-specific histone 2B, and testosterone to evaluate apoptosis, oxidative DNA damage, cellular proliferation, and steroidogenesis, respectively. Serum levels of testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured by biochemical analysis. The results showed that both SST and NAC treatments significantly ameliorated histopathological damage and reduced the levels of caspase- 3 and 8-OHdG, indicating reduced apoptosis and oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, increased testis-specific histone 2B positivity suggested enhanced cellular proliferation. Notably, administration of SST decreased testosterone positivity in the testis, whereas NAC treatment increased it. However, no significant differences in serum testosterone levels were observed between the NAC and SST groups. In addition, serum FSH levels of the I/R + SST group were found to be significantly higher than those of the control group. SST and NAC exhibit protective effects against testicular damage induced by I/R, as evidenced by their antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. The differential impact on testosterone positivity in the testis tissue highlights distinct underlying mechanisms, warranting further investigation. Despite these promising findings, the lack of significant changes in serum hormone levels calls for additional studies to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential and mechanistic pathways of SST and NAC in the context of testicular I/R injury."

The study aim is to determine the effect of a high dose of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on biochemical and inflammatory markers of neuronal damage and clinical outcomes in patients with moderate to severe TBI. METHODS: A randomized open label-controlled trial was conducted on 40 patients with moderate to severe TBI patients presented to the emergency unit within < 24 h since the trauma occurred and randomized into NAC and control groups 20 patients each. Serum samples for evaluation of biomarkers: malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and S100B were withdrawn at baseline and on day 7. The patients were followed for 7 days and evaluated clinically by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in NSE and MDA levels on day 7 from baseline in NAC group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). Also, S100B and IL-6 decreased significantly in NAC group on day 7 from baseline (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001 consequently) compared to control group. Moreover, patients in NAC group showed a significantly shorter length of stay at intensive care unit (ICU) (p = 0.038). There was a significant increase in GCS in NAC group on day 7 from baseline (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive early use of high-dose NAC significantly reduced inflammatory and oxidative markers and had neuroprotective effect which may be a novel treatment option for moderate to severe TBI patients.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is scarce information about the most used mucolytic drug in bronchiectasis N-acetylcysteine (N-AC). Our objective was to analyze the effect of N-AC with respect to some outcomes in bronchiectasis. METHODS: Ambispective, longitudinal, observational, multi-center (43 centers) study of a cohort of 2461 adult patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis. Those patients treated in a stable situation with at least 600mg/d of N-AC (368; 15%) for at least 6 months were compared with patients not receiving this treatment. The variables analyzed and compared were those available two years before and after treatment. ANCOVA analysis was used to analyze the effect of N-AC as the inter-group difference of the basal intra-group difference for each variable, adjusted for relevant covariables. RESULTS: The N-AC group showed a full adjusted improvement of 27% in exacerbations, 17% in hospitalizations, and 31% in total exacerbation rates compared with the no-N-AC group. Moreover, a decrease in the volume of sputum production of 59.7% was observed as well as a decrease of 12% of patients with bronchial infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The use of 1200mg/d (n=116) resulted in only a mild, albeit significative improvement in the exacerbation rate compared with the use of 600mg/d (-11% in absolute number). Both doses were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: N-AC (in most cases at a dose of 600mg/d) is safe and effective and sufficient to reduce both the number of exacerbations and hospitalizations and the purulence and volume of sputum, as well as the isolation rate of PA in patients with bronchiectasis.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate safety, tolerance, and therapeutic potential of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in lowering disease-associated biomarkers in sequence variation carriers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2a open-label clinical trial was conducted from March 2019 to December 2021 at a single study center at Landspitali University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, and included 17 confirmed carriers of the L68Q-CST3 sequence variation. INTERVENTION: High-dose NAC treatment was administered at 2400 mg daily for 9 months. Participants underwent regular monitoring for hemorrhages and disease progression, including blood and skin biopsy samples obtained every 3 months for biomarker testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were drug tolerability and safety, cognitive status, and reduction in disease-associated biomarkers in skin biopsies. Secondary outcomes included changes in blood and plasma biomarker levels. RESULTS: Of 17 carriers treated, 6 were male and 11 were female, and mean (SD) participant age was 40.0 (4.2) years. Analysis of the primary outcomes showed that NAC was safe and well tolerated. Five cerebral bleeds occurred during the treatment period without permanent neurological sequela; no death occurred. There was significant reduction in median (IQR) disease-specific biomarker levels in skin after treatment, including collagen IV (baseline: 3.69% [2.48%-5.16%]; after treatment: 2.60% [1.99%-2.97%]; P < .001), fibronectin (baseline: 3.17% [2.09%-5.05%]; after treatment: 2.37% [1.87%-3.42%]; P = .01), vimentin (baseline: 1.60% [1.24%-2.37%]; after treatment: 1.31% [0.97%-1.68%]; P < .001), and SMAD (baseline: 2.25% [0.55%-4.36%]; after treatment: 1.56% [0.20%-2.54%]; P < .001) via Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Secondary outcomes included a significant increase in reduced glutathione levels and decreased high-molecular-weight cystatin C aggregate levels in plasma after NAC treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center nonrandomized clinical trial, NAC was safe and well tolerated and decreased disease-associated biomarker and amyloid deposition, suggesting NAC may offer a preventive strategy against HCCAA.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may help in the treatment of organophosphates poisoning, including Pirymiphos methyl (PM). However, there is no information on the effect of NAC on target cholinesterases during the core treatment with atropine and obidoxime after acute and chronic exposure to PM. The impact was investigated of NAC on the functional status of target cholinesterases in the brain and blood during treatment with atropine (ATR) and/or obidoxime (OBID) in PM-induced toxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All experiments were performed on Male Swiss mice. The animals were intoxicated with PM and treated with OBID and/or ATR with or without and NAC, in various combinations (with 2-3 drugs) used simultaneously after intoxication. Total acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) in brain and blood and plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity (BChE) were monitored at 2 and 72 h after intoxication. Enzyme activity was determined using Ellman's colorimetric method. RESULTS: The applied therapies with OBID, ATR and NAC in various configurations significantly reactivated PM-inhibited AChE in the brain and erythrocytes and the BChE in the plasma. The benefits of NAC administration in combination with ATR and/or OBID therapy have also been reported to restore AChE activity in the brain. NAC may reduce the dose of ATR in the treatment of PM poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive treatment offered by NAC can reduce or prevent the deleterious effects against PM-induced toxicity. Therefore, NAC remains a strong candidate for adjunct treatment for OP-poisoning, including PM, although additional preclinical and clinical studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "Cataracts, the leading cause of blindness globally, are caused by oxidative stress and inflammation, which disrupt lens transparency due to increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as protein and DNA damage during aging. Using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we determined the protective efficacy of N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) against oxidative stress-induced and aging-induced cataractogenesis. We found that lens epithelial cells exposed to the oxidative stress inducers hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide showed significant ROS accumulation and reduced cellular viability. These effects were inhibited by NACA via the suppression of ROS and thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) expression, a regulator of oxidative stress-related cellular damage and inflammation. In ex vivo lens experiments, NACA significantly reduced H2O2-induced lens opacity and preserved lens integrity. Similarly to NACA-treated lenses ex vivo, the integrity and opacity of aged mouse lenses, when topically instilled with NACA, were preserved and reduced, respectively, and are directly related to reduced Txnip and increased thioredoxin (Trx) expression levels. Overall, our findings demonstrated the protective ability of NACA to abate aberrant redox-active pathways, particularly the ROS/TRX/TXNIP axis, thereby preventing cataractogenesis and preserving eye lens integrity and ultimately impeding aging-related cataracts.",

      "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is a common type of pain that causes disability and impairs cognitive function. With over 80% of adults estimated to experience LBP during their lifetime, this type of pain not only has a significant impact on the individual, but also on public health systems and national economies. Unfortunately, there is no single standard of care for patients with LBP. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is used clinically to treat acetaminophen overdose, has recently been tested as a potential treatment for LBP. NAC is inexpensive and commercially available, and it has an established tolerance and safety profile. However, NAC's efficacy in LBP has not been established. This scoping review presents a summary of studies investigating the effects of NAC and the potential benefits in LBP treatment, and highlights its potential molecular mechanisms and side effects. A systematic literature search in Pubmed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cinahl, and Lilacs databases was conducted. The PRISMA-ScR checklist was used to ensure integrity of the review. The scoping review protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework. No limit was set on study language and publication date. In total, 2357 articles were located, of which 16 were included. The studies show that NAC has potential for LBP treatment, but data are derived only from a few clinical trials and preclinical studies. Thus, there is much to learn and more clinical studies should be performed before NAC can be clinically recommended for the treatment of LBP.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the early effects of N-acetylcysteine, which has antioxidant, inflame-modulatory, and cytoprotective properties, on tendon healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five male Wistar Hannover rats were divided into five groups: first-week treatment (Group 1T), first-week control (Group 1C), third-week treatment (Group 3T), third-week control (Group 3C), and native tendons (Group N). Bilateral Achilles tenotomy was performed on all rats except Group N. After tenotomy, 150 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine was administered daily intraperitoneally to treatment groups, while isotonic saline was given to the control groups. Tendons were evaluated histopathologically, immunohistochemically, and biomechanically after sacrifice in the first and third weeks. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the first week (p > 0.05). Movin and Bonar scores (lower scores reflect improved histologic healing) were significantly lower in Group 3T than in Group 3C (p = 0.002). Collagen type-I/type-III ratios were higher in Group 3T compared to Group 3C (p = 0.001). Fmax (N) values were similar across Group 3T, Group 3C, and Group N (p = 0.772). However, cross-sectional areas (mm2) were significantly smaller in Group 3T than in Group 3C (p = 0.001), with the smallest areas observed in native tendons. Thus, tensile strength (MPa, load per unit area) and toughness (J/103 mm3, energy absorbed per unit volume) were significantly higher in Group 3T than in Group 3C (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: N-acetylcysteine supplied some improved results on early markers of tendon healing. Although our findings support the potential of NAC as a therapeutic adjunct in tendon injuries, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects and underlying mechanisms."

Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups of 10 animals each. Saline was administered intragastrically to control group for 14 days. In NAC group, 150 mg/kg NAC was injected intraperitoneally for 21 days. In TiO2NP group, TiO2NP at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day, dissolved in saline, was administered intragastrically for 14 days. TiO2NP + NAC group received 50 mg/kg/day TiO2NP for 14 days and 150 mg/kg NAC for 21 days, starting 7 days before TiO2NP administration. At the end of experiment, rats were anesthetized, serum samples were collected for biochemical analysis, and kidney tissue was removed for histological and immunohistochemical analyses. There was no significant change in body weight, kidney weight, or serum urea-creatinine levels between the groups. TiO2NP caused a significant increase in vacuolization and brush border loss scores in tubular cells, as well as scores for congestion and leukocyte infiltration. However, NAC supplementation significantly ameliorated these impairments. Additionally, TiO2NP significantly increased NF-kB, TNF-α, and caspase-3 immunoreactivities, as well as the number of PCNA-positive and TUNEL-positive cells. NAC treatment decreased all immunoreactivities and TUNEL-positive cells, but did not change the number of PCNA-positive cells after TiO2NP exposure. The results of the study showed that the toxic effects of TiO2NP on the kidneys, commonly encountered in daily life, can be mitigated by the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of NAC.",

For faster recovery of patients with complicated hemoprotozoan diseases, whole blood transfusion or bone marrow stimulating agents to produce more red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets might be helpful. Unfortunately, canine specific transfusion procedures are expensive and even not available in many developing countries. Development of alternate therapeutic modality by bone marrow stimulation to augment the production of RBCs and platelets and thus, to treat the critical pancytopenic patients is and an urgent necessity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), acts as a precursor of reduced glutathione and increases the production of bone marrow B cells. It also improves viability and self-renewal capacity of stem cells and thus, boosts hematopoietic differentiation by protecting induced pluripotent stem cells. This study envisaged to develop alternate therapeutic approach to combat pancytopenia secondary to canine hemoprotozoan diseases. Bone marrow mediated aplastic pancytopenia was induced experimentally by administration of cyclophosphamide in rats. Bone marrow stimulating property of NAC was compared with desmopressin, another bone marrow stimulator, which revealed better in terms of hematobiochemical and histopathological changes. Results of rat model study were extrapolated in clinical canine hemoprotozoan cases having pancytopenia. Dogs treated with hemoprotozoan disease specific therapy along with NAC rendered favorable changes by haltering the progression of critical anemia and thrombocytopenia. Study revealed that supplementation of NAC along with canine hemoprotozoan specific therapy is beneficial to alleviate pancytopenia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with cocaine use disorder experience heightened motivation to pursue rewards tied to cocaine, often triggered by associated cues. Cue reactivity and subsequent craving significantly elevate the risk of substance use, creating a pressing need for treatments that can help alleviate cravings. However, no pharmaceutical therapies for treating cocaine use disorder have been approved. Preclinical findings reveal dysfunctions in the glutamatergic pathway connecting prefrontal regions with the nucleus accumbens, which are correlated with cue-induced substance-seeking behaviour. These alterations, at both molecular and behavioural levels, can be reversed in rodents with N-acetylcysteine, a modulator of glutamatergic signalling. In contrast, the therapeutic potential for humans remains uncertain. METHODS: Here, we assessed the impact of a short-term challenge with N-acetylcysteine on neural responses to cocaine cues and cue-induced craving in a randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial using a fMRI cue reactivity paradigm. In total, 44 fMRI cue reactivity scans of 22 individuals with cocaine use disorder were recorded-once after the administration of 2,400 mg of N-acetylcysteine/day for 2 days and once after placebo intake. RESULTS: In the placebo condition, participants showed increased cue reactivity towards cocaine pictures, accompanied by significantly higher cravings as compared to neutral images. In accordance with recent meta-analyses, cue reactivity was evident in parietal regions such as the posterior cingulate and precuneus, temporal regions like the hippocampus, the bilateral insula, and medial prefrontal regions, namely the inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyrus. Cue-induced activity in the superior frontal gyrus was strongly predicted by the individual duration of cocaine use. While N-acetylcysteine showed no impact on subjectively rated cocaine craving, neural cue reactivity in the superior frontal gyrus was significantly decreased under N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that prefrontal reactivity to cocaine cues can be reduced even by a brief pharmacological challenge with N-acetylcysteine. Since neural drug cue reactivity has been shown to be a precursor of relapse behaviour, N-acetylcysteine's therapeutic potential should be further investigated in future studies by extending treatment periods.

Outcomes of adhering to this more conservative approach are not well studied. We sought to determine if an approach conforming to guidelines is noninferior to a previously practiced more liberal approach. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 2,272 subjects receiving mechanical ventilation ≥48 h within 5 adult ICUs between June 2020 and August 2023. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days at day 28 (VFD28). Secondary outcomes included ventilator days, ICU days, hospital stay, re-intubation rates, and mortality. Analysis was stratified by before and after policy implementation (see intervention) and by receiving HTS/NAC or not (ϕHTS/NAC). The latter was examined before and after propensity matching. The Δ for noninferiority was -0.5 days for VFD28 and +0.5 days for other continuous variables. As outcomes were not normally distributed, we analyzed them using Mann-Whitney U statistics. Results: Two thousand two hundred seventy-two subjects were evaluated. The mean age was 58.70 + 16.13 years and 929 (40.9%) subjects were women. HTS/NAC administration was reduced after policy implementation (40.2% before policy and 8.9% after policy; a reduction of 77.9%). The post-policy group and ϕHTS/NAC before and after propensity matching groups were all noninferior to the comparators. Subjects had significantly more VFD28 in the post-policy group, median (IQR), post 21 (0-25), pre: 20 (0-24), P = .02; and in the ϕHTS/NAC group, before matching ϕHTS/NAC: 21 (0-25), HTS/NAC: 18 (0-23), P < .001 and after propensity matching ϕHTS/NAC: 21 (0-25), HTS/NAC; 18 (0-23), P < .001. Conclusions: Restricting practice to conform to the AARC Clinical Practice Guideline was noninferior to more liberal use. The use of HTS/NAC in mechanically ventilated subjects does not appear efficacious and is both costly and time-consuming."

We proposed that maternal N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) supplementation during lactation, a critical period for neurodevelopment, potentially protects offspring from developing cognitive impairment in adulthood. Fifteen young female ICR mice were randomly allocated to different experimental groups: high-fat diet (HFD; 60.3% fat before mating, during pregnancy and lactation), HFD-NAC of 300 mg/kg/day during lactation, CD (high-fat diet before mating, during pregnancy, and regular chow control diet of 8.2% fat during lactation), CD-NAC of 300 mg/kg/day during lactation and control group consuming regular chow diet. The serum inflammatory markers of the offspring were evaluated post-weaning, while metabolic markers, microglial density, and cognitive performance were assessed in adulthood using the novel Object Recognition and Morris Water Maze tests. Our results demonstrate maternal obesity during gestation and lactation increased body weight, hepatic steatosis, and microglial cell density in the dentate gyrus (DG) and cortex. Furthermore, these offspring exhibited reduced spatial learning abilities in adulthood, regardless of sex. However, maternal NAC administration during lactation and maternal diet intervention significantly reduced brain microglial density and improved both male and female offspring metabolic profiles. More importantly, NAC supplementation during lactation, regardless of maternal diet, enhanced male offspring's learning ability in adulthood. Our findings indicate that administering NAC to obese mothers during the critical lactation period may offer protection against metabolic disturbances and cognitive deficits in adult offspring previously exposed to maternal obesity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder that results from a microdeletion of 25 to 27 genes on chromosome 7q11.23. Individuals with WS often exhibit comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially anxiety. To our knowledge, nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSIB) has not been reported in WS. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a safe and readily available drug that may modulate glutamate activity in the brain. NAC is effective for treating various neuropsychiatric symptoms and disorders. There are limited reports in the literature where NAC has been used to treat NSSIB effectively, but none in WS. METHODS: This report describes using NAC to treat NSSIB in 3 adults with WS. FINDINGS: Nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior was successfully treated in 3 adults with WS using NAC in doses ranging from 2400 to 3600 mg a day, resulting in significant improvement in their daily functioning. Additionally, NAC was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: NAC was effective for treating NSSIB in 3 adults with WS. By addressing these challenging behaviors, NAC offers a promising pharmacological intervention that can significantly improve the quality of life for patients with WS who engage in NSSIB. Further research and clinical trials are necessary."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Contrast-induced acute renal injury is the third leading cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury. Our trial aimed to compare high-dose statin versus statin plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized control trial included patients who undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at Alshifa Hospital in Gaza, the first group (statin: 50 patients) received 80 mg of atorvastatin orally once daily for 3 days. The second group (statin + NAC: 50 patients) received 80 mg of atorvastatin orally once daily for 3 days, plus NAC 1200 mg orally twice daily every 12 h for 2 days. All patients underwent measurement of serum creatinine and urea level before PCI and 2-3 days after the procedure. The primary endpoint was to compare development of contrast-induced nephropathy between the two groups. RESULTS: The total group comprised 100 patients: 71 male patients and 29 female patients. Mean age was 59 ±9.8 years. After intervention serum creatinine decreased from 1.02 ±0.27 mg/dl to1.01 ±0.29 mg/dl in the statin group, while it decreased from 1.08 ±0.36 mg/dl to 0.92 ±0.13 mg/dl in the statin + NAC group. The difference between the two groups was significant (p = 0.048). Also, the urea plasma level in the statin group decreased from 34.5 ±9.7 mmol/l to 30.6 ±8.7 mmol/l after PCI, while in the statin + NAC group it decreased from 36.4 ±9.9 mmol/l to 26.2 ±10.6 mmol/l; the difference between the two groups was significant (p = 0.017). Contrast-induced nephropathy was seen in 9 (18%) patients in the statin group and in 2 (4%) patients in the statin + NAC group (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of high-dose atorvastatin plus NAC compared to atorvastatin alone was associated with a significant reduction of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing PCI."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely prescribed and effective chemotherapeutic drug, but its cardiotoxic side effects pose a significant challenge to its use. Identifying a protective agent that does not affect its anticancer efficacy is essential. Our study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) against 5-FU-induced cardiac injury and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Materials and Methods: This study included four experimental groups, each with eight rats (n = 8): Group I (control group), Group II (NAC group), Group III (5-FU group), and Group IV (combined group 5-FU+NAC). Cardiac enzymes, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers were investigated, and cardiac sections from the different groups were histologically examined. Results: Co-treatment of 5-FU with NAC resulted in significantly lower levels of cardiac enzymes (alanine transaminase (ALT) by 62.1%, aspartate transaminase (AST) by 73.6%, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by 55.8%, and creatine kinase (CK) by 57.3%) compared to the 5-FU group, along with marked improvements in heart tissue histology. Additionally, NAC enhanced the activity of cardiac antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 295.6%, catalase (CAT) by 181%, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) by 320.9%) while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) by 51.1%, a marker of membranous lipid peroxidation. This might be due to significant upregulation of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway at the gene and protein levels. The combined treatment significantly decreased the gene expression of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cell (NF-κB) pathway. Furthermore, it downregulated the protein levels of inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) by 29.9%, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) by 21.9%, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by 49.3%. Moreover, it upregulated the antiapoptotic marker B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein levels by 269% and decreased apoptotic indicators Bcl-2-associated protein x (Bax) by 57.9% and caspase-3 by 30.6% compared to the 5-FU group. Conclusions: This study confirmed that NAC prevented the cardiotoxic effect of 5-FU through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, suggesting its potential application as an adjuvant therapy in chemotherapy to alleviate 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "The etiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is intricate, leading to its classification as an autoimmune metabolic disorder. T1DM often coexists with various visceral diseases. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is widely acknowledged for its potent antioxidant properties. Studies have demonstrated that the combination of NAC and insulin can effectively alleviate iron-induced nephropathy in T1DM and mitigate oxidative stress injury in skeletal muscle associated with the condition. However, the potential impact of NAC alone on liver disease in individuals with T1DM remains uncertain. In this study, a beagle model was established to simulate T1DM, enabling investigation into the role of NAC in liver disease using RNA-seq biogenic analysis and subsequent validation through molecular biological methods. The findings revealed suppressed expression of CXCL12 chemokine in the livers of individuals with T1DM, while treatment with NAC induced specific activation of CXCL12 within the liver affected by T1DM. These results suggest that CXCL12 may serve as a regulatory factor involved in the therapeutic effects of NAC on liver disease associated with TIDM. This discovery holds significant implications for utilizing NAC as an adjunctive therapy for managing complicated liver diseases accompanying type 1 diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A sense of loss of control over eating, such that eating occurs despite the intent not to, is common in people with obesity and eating disorders such as binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa. Currently, options for management of loss of control eating are limited. We recently determined that the pro-drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduces compulsive-like eating in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. We will now conduct a single site, open-label pilot study to examine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NAC for loss of control eating in humans. METHODS: Thirty-six adult volunteers with loss of control eating will be enrolled. All participants will receive NAC at a dose of 1200 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks. Eating behaviors and triggers will be assessed before and after the NAC treatment period using questionnaires (Eating Loss of Control Scale, Palatable Eating Motives Scale: Coping Subscale, Food Craving Inventory, Reward-Based Eating Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Emotional Eating Scale) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The primary outcomes of this feasibility study are recruitment rate, participant retention rate at week 12, and medication adherence. The secondary outcome is change in Eating Loss of Control Scale score from baseline to week 12. Exploratory data will be collected on the change in eating behaviors from baseline to week 12. Although EMA can provide real-time data on eating behaviors compared with retrospective questionnaires, it relies on repeated daily measurement for long periods which can affect participant's adherence to study protocol. Therefore, this feasibility study will assess the performance of EMA versus retrospective questionnaires and will determine which approach suits the purposes of the research. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will inform the feasibility of a RCT of NAC for loss of control eating using EMA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was prospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry in June 2022 (ACTRN12622000902796)."

      "abstract": "We previously showed that antioxidants induced an impairment of negative feedback of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in rats, in parallel to a down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression in the pituitary gland. This study evaluated the role of the Nrf2-heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway on the impairment of the negative feedback of the HPA axis induced by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Male Swiss-Webster mice were orally supplemented with NAC for 5 consecutive days. The Nrf2-HO-1 pathway activator cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) was injected intraperitoneally on days 2 and 5 after the starting of NAC supplementation. NAC reduced the expression of Nrf2 in the pituitary of mice. Furthermore, NAC induced adrenal enlargement and hypercorticoidism, along with a decrease in the GRα expression and an increase of GRβ expression in the pituitary gland. Treatment with CoPPIX reduced adrenal enlargement, systemic corticosterone levels, and GRβ expression in the pituitary gland of mice supplemented with NAC, besides increasing the expression of GRα. CoPPIX treatment also restored the failure in the negative feedback of the HPA axis induced by NAC. In conclusion, these findings showed that NAC reduced the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway activation in the pituitary gland, in a mechanism probably related to a local downregulation of GRα and an up-regulation of GRβ, leading to a failure of negative feedback of the HPA axis and consequently to the hyperactivity of this neuroendocrine axis.",

AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of chitosan, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and Aegle marmelos as intracanal medicaments against E. faecalis biofilm. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: Minimum inhibitory concentration and susceptibility of medicaments determined. Two hundred and forty dentin disc specimens were prepared and inoculated with E. faecalis for 21 days. Samples were divided into four groups (A - N-acetylcysteine; B - Aegle marmelos; C - Chitosan; D -Control) (n = 60), and two subgroups (n = 30) based on the duration of medicament placed (subgroup 1: 24 h, subgroup 2: 7 days). Thereafter, dentinal shavings were retrieved, incubated in agar plate, visible colonies counted, and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: At 24 h Group C1 exhibited the lowest CFUs, followed by Group A1, Group B, and Group D1. On the 7th day, Group B2 showed the lowest CFUs, followed by Group A2, Group C2, and Group D2. CONCLUSIONS: Against E. faecalis, NAC has the highest antimicrobial properties closely followed by Aegle marmelos and both provide promising novel possibilities for use as intracanal medicaments."

This study investigated the potential effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, on primary and recurrent mouse brain tumors. METHODS: We measured reactive oxygen species (ROS)/ glutathione (GSH) levels in human GBM. Additionally, we conducted NAC trials on primary mouse brain tumor models (GL261-Luc, CT2A-Luc) and a recurrent mouse GBM model (GL261-iCasp9-Luc). After brain tumor inoculation, mice received a daily 100 mg/kg NAC treatment, and the tumor volume was monitored via IVIS imaging. The efficacy of NAC was evaluated through survival time, tumor volume, ROS/GSH levels, M1/M2 macrophages, immune cells infiltration, and tumor vascularization. RESULTS: Human GBM suffered from significant oxidative stress. With NAC treatment, mouse brain tumors exhibited a lower ROS level, more M1-like tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs), more CD8 + T cell infiltration, and a normalized vascular character. NAC inhibited tumor growth and suppressed recurrence in mouse brain tumor models. CONCLUSION: NAC is a promising adjunctive drug to remodel the brain tumors microenvironment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of sulfur-containing drugs, disulfiram (DSF) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), in alleviating neuroinflammation is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of DSF and NAC on memory and on the metabolism of L-cysteine and inflammation-related parameters in the cerebral cortex of rats in a model of neuroinflammation induced by the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: All the treatments were administered intraperitoneally for 10 days (LPS at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg b.w., DSF at a dose of 100 mg/kg b.w, and NAC at a dose of 100 mg/kg b.w.). Behavior was evaluated by the novel object recognition (NOR) test and object location (OL) test, and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was assayed to evaluate neuronal functioning. Cerebral cortex homogenates were tested for hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfane sulfur, sulfates, non-protein sulfhydryl groups (NPSH), nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Neither DSF nor NAC alleviated LPS-induced memory disorders estimated by the NOR test and OL test. The studied compounds also did not affect significantly the levels of BDNF, ROS, NO, H2S, and sulfane sulfur in the cerebral cortex. However, we observed an increase in sulfate concentration in brain tissues after LPS treatment, while DSF and NAC caused an additional increase in sulfate concentration. On the other hand, our study showed that the administration of DSF or NAC together with LPS significantly enhanced the cortical level of NPSH, of which glutathione is the main component. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not confirm the suggested potential of DSF and NAC to correct memory disorders; however, it corroborated the notion that they reduced oxidative stress induced by LPS by increasing the NPSH level. Additionally, our study showed an increase in sulfate concentration in the brain tissues after LPS treatment, which means the upregulation of sulfite and sulfate production in inflammatory conditions.",

Prior trials of N-acetylcysteine, added to contingency management as a platform behavioral intervention, yielded positive findings in youth but not in adults. This trial sought to rigorously evaluate whether N-acetylcysteine is efficacious in youth when not paired with a robust behavioral treatment platform. Treatment-seeking youth with cannabis use disorder (N = 192, ages 14-21) were randomized to receive a double-blind 12-week course of oral N-acetylcysteine 1200 mg or placebo twice daily; all received weekly medical management and brief behavioral counseling. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of negative urine cannabinoid tests during treatment, compared between groups. An array of self-report and urine testing measures were examined secondarily to assess cannabis use reduction and cessation outcomes. The N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups did not differ in proportion of negative urine cannabinoid tests (RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.53, 1.64; p = 0.80) or self-reported cannabis abstinence (RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.63, 1.65; p = 0.93) during treatment. The mean percentage of cannabis use days and grams of cannabis used per using day decreased over time during treatment but did not differ between groups. More N-acetylcysteine than placebo treated participants reported gastrointestinal adverse events (63/98 versus 37/94, χ21 = 11.9 p < 0.001); adverse events were otherwise similar between groups. Findings indicate that N-acetylcysteine is not efficacious for youth cannabis use disorder when not paired with contingency management, highlighting the potentially crucial role of a robust behavioral treatment platform in facilitating prior positive efficacy findings with N-acetylcysteine.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03055377.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Effective preventive strategies for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in T2DM patients are limited. Recent studies have explored the cardiovascular benefits of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant with endothelial protective properties. This study investigates the long-term effects of NAC on MACE risk in T2DM patients, focusing on its potential as an adjunctive therapy. METHODS: This population-based cohort study used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and included 46,718 T2DM patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2018, with follow-up until December 31, 2021. Propensity score matching (PSM) ensured balanced comparisons between NAC users and non-users. Cox regression and time-dependent Cox hazards models assessed MACE risk, adjusting for multiple covariates. RESULTS: In the matched cohort of 23,359 NAC users and 23,359 non-users, NAC users had a significantly lower incidence of MACE (41.74 % vs. 46.87 %, P < .0001). Adjusted Hazard Ratios (aHRs) indicated a consistent protective effect of NAC against overall MACE (aHR: 0.84; 95 % CI: 0.81-0.86, P < .0001). Higher cumulative defined daily doses (cDDD) of NAC correlated with reduced MACE risk, with the highest quartile (Q4) showing an aHR of 0.61 (95 % CI: 0.58-0.64, P < .0001). CONCLUSION: This study underscores the significant reduction in MACE risk among T2DM patients with long-term NAC therapy. Notably, the findings emphasize NAC's dose-dependent effectiveness in diminishing MACE incidence, indicating its potential as a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing cardiovascular risk in T2DM patients.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Paracetamol poisoning can be serious and require treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A dose of 300 mg/kg is usually given in 3 fractions over 21 hours. An alternative regimen, the Scottish and Newcastle Acetylcysteine Protocol (SNAP), specifies the same total dose given in 2 intravenous injections over 12 hours. This study aimed to compare the 2 regimens in terms of effectiveness, adverse events, and lengths of emergency department (ED) and hospital stays. METHODS: Prospective multicenter study to compare outcomes associated with the traditional NAC regimen vs SNAP. We enrolled all patients with paracetamol poisoning requiring NAC treatment in the participating hospital EDs from 2021 through 2023. Data related to referrals, poisoning episodes, and discharge destinations were collected. Patients were studied in 2 groups according to the protocol assigned in the EDs. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients were treated (SNAP, 103; traditional protocol, 62). The mean (SD) age was 28.1 (19.7) years, and most were female (70.5%). No differences in peak transaminase levels were observed. SNAP-treated patients had significantly fewer adverse effects as well as shorter stays both in the ED (17.8 [15.2] hours vs 25.9 [17.1] hours; P = .001) and on the ward (2.6 [2.3] days vs 4.4 [3.6] days; P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Fewer adverse events occurred with the SNAP approach. The 2 protocols were similarly effective. The SNAP-treated patients spent less time in the ED, and those who were admitted to hospital had shorter stays.",

This study aims to investigate the effect of ND with or without N -acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment on oxidative damage and TLR4/NF-κB /NLRP3 signaling pathway in the heart of male rats. Eighteen male Wistar rats with a weight range of 220 ± 10 g were selected. They were divided into three groups (n = 6): control (C) group, ND group, NAC + ND group. After six weeks of treatment, the TUNEL staining indicated that ND increased the number of apoptotic cells in the hearts of male rats. The molecular analysis demonstrated that ND exposure resulted in increased protein levels of cytochrome c, c-Caspase-3/p-Caspase-3 ratio, p53, TLR4, NF-κB, NLRP3, and 8-OHdG with a concomitant up-regulation of LDH and CK-MB enzymes activity in the heart tissue compared to the C group. Our findings suggested that ND can cause damage to heart tissue via induction of DNA damage, apoptosis, and probably TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in this process. It also demonstrates that these negative effects of ND can be reduced by using NAC treatment as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.",

      "abstract": "Effective root canal disinfection is crucial for the success of endodontic treatment. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), known for its antimicrobial properties, has recently been investigated as a potential endodontic irrigant or intracanal medication. This systematic review aims to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of NAC in comparison to sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and calcium hydroxide against endodontic pathogens. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and LILACS databases up to April 2024, without language or date restrictions. The PICO strategy for this review were as follows: population-teeth requiring endodontic treatment; intervention-NAC used as an endodontic irrigant or intracanal medication; comparison-sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and calcium hydroxide; Outcomes: reduction in microbial load, encompassing clinical and in vitro studies. Risks of bias assessment and data extraction were conducted with two reviewers independently selecting studies, extracting data, and assessing risk of bias. A general meta-analysis was performed across all included studies, with additional meta-analyses evaluating different exposure times, NAC concentrations, control groups and evaluation methods. After removing duplicates, 9170 studies were initially identified, and seven in vitro studies were included in the systematic review, of which five were included in the meta-analysis. Data were compared using standardized mean differences within a random-effects model. No clinical studies using NAC as an antimicrobial agent were identified. The overall meta-analysis demonstrated that NAC effectively reduced Enterococcus faecalis. Further meta-analyses revealed that exposure time, NAC concentration and choice of control group significantly influenced NAC's effectiveness. NAC effectively reduced Enterococcus faecalis, showing comparable antimicrobial activity to CHX and NaOCl, especially at concentrations of 25-50 mg/mL over a 7-day exposure. Despite significant heterogeneity across studies, NAC demonstrated satisfactory antimicrobial effects in vitro. This suggests that NAC merits reconsideration as an effective intracanal medication for clinical use."

Although these cases are scarce, they are extremely serious and may lead to liver transplantation or death. Management of toxic hepatitis, once the causative agent has been discontinued, is essentially symptomatic, based on clinical and biological monitoring and prevention of complications related to acute hepatitis. CASE DETAILS: We present a case of a 28-year-old woman admitted to the emergency department for acute hepatitis due to cocaine intoxication. In addition to a sharp rise in her liver enzymes, the patient also presented metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. Treatment consisted of administering N-acetylcysteine (NAC), dialysis, and additional supportive measures. An improvement in the liver function with a decrease in transaminases occurred after the NAC administration. The toxicokinetics of major cocaine metabolites and clinical chemistry concentrations were monitored. CONCLUSION: In addition to the usual management measures for acute hepatitis, the administration of N-acetylcysteine should be investigated further, although it is currently used only in cases of acetaminophen acute toxic hepatitis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age and requires better treatment. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is known to be beneficial under such conditions owing to its antioxidant potential and insulin-sensitizing properties. The effect of NAC on the reproductive outcomes of PCOS patients was examined in this meta-analysis. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA standards, this meta-analysis included studies that compared N-acetylcysteine, metformin, clomiphene citrate, and a placebo in patients with POCS. The main indicators were follicular growth, endometrial thickness, and hormone level. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane ROB2 tool. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies (n = 2515) were included. NAC was associated with a statistically significant increase in progesterone (SMD 0.95, 95% CI: 0.13-1.77, p = 0.02) and endometrial thickness (SMD 0.58, 95% CI: 0.10-1.06, p = 0.02) compared to the placebo and other drugs (SMD 0.71, 95% CI: 0.48-0.94, p < 0.0001). LH levels were significantly increased by NAC compared to metformin (SMD 0.67, 95% CI: 0.23-1.12, p = 0.003). However, no significant differences were observed in the estradiol, SHBG, or FSH levels. CONCLUSIONS: NAC had a major effect on progesterone, endometrial thickness, and LH levels in women with PCOS. Therefore, it may be a potential treatment option.",

However, the eye's complex physiological environment reduces its bioavailability, and repeated use can lead to significant systemic toxicity and side effects. This study introduces a novel conjugate of chitosan (CS) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a bioadhesive material, which was grafted onto the surface of a Dex-supported nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) to develop an innovative nanoparticle lipid ocular drug delivery system (CS-NAC@Dex-NLC). The enhancements afforded by CS-NAC, such as adhesion, osmotic, and targeting properties, address the limitations of traditional eye drops. NMR characterization confirmed the successful synthesis of the copolymer (CS-NAC). Particle size (PS), zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) verified the proper formation of the CS-NAC@Dex-NLC system. Cytotoxicity tests confirmed its excellent biocompatibility and safety. Cellular uptake studies showed that CS-NAC@Dex-NLC achieved the highest efficiency. Pharmacokinetic assessments revealed a significant increase in Dex's bioavailability in tears and aqueous humor. In vitro corneal penetration and in vivo imaging experiments demonstrated effective corneal penetration and retention, enhancing the drug's duration on the ocular surface and overcoming the barrier effect. Pharmacodynamic studies in rabbits with dry eye syndrome indicated that CS-NAC@Dex-NLC effectively alleviates symptoms, repairs corneal damage, and stabilizes the tear film. ELISA results showed a reduction in inflammation caused by dry eye. These findings suggest that CS-NAC@Dex-NLC is a promising vector for dry eye treatment, offering significant clinical relevance.",

Studies suggest that in nerve agents poisoning, non-cholinergic effects are also responsible for damage in peripheral tissues including long term damage in brain. Present study reports cholinergic and non-cholinergic effects of VX poisoning and their prevention by use of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in addition to conventional antidotes atropine sulphate and 2-PAM chloride as an antioxidant. NAC was chosen being an approved drug for medical conditions including oxidative damage and as mucolytic. RESULTS: Results of the study showed that after 1x LD 50 exposure to VX and standard atropine and oxime therapy resulted in recovery of cholinesterase activity up to 51%, while additional NAC administration resulted in increased recovery up to 89% in brain cholinesterase activity. NAC also helped in maintaining intracellular and tissue GSH level, reduced ROS generation and lipid peroxidation. NAC treatment could able to reduce the lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels in liver of NAC administered groups as compared to standard treatment of atropine sulphate and PAM chloride at 10 LD 50 VX. Likewise, a 20% higher level of GSH was found in NAC treated group at 1x LD 50 dose in brain. Cell cycle analysis and histopathological results showed that NAC prevents VX induced damage. CONCLUSION: it was found that use of antioxidant agent NAC along with standard atropine-oxime treatment is helpful in reducing the cholinergic and oxidative stress mediated toxicity induced by VX."

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion in cases of acute AP poisoning. METHODS: This randomized, single-blinded, parallel-group, controlled, clinical trial enrolled 96 patients with acute AP poisoning. The patients were allocated to two groups and received either conventional treatment (control group) or conventional treatment plus NAC infusion (NAC group). The patients were subjected to full clinical evaluation, routine laboratory investigations, silver nitrate test, and evaluation of the oxidative markers, malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), at admission and after 24 h treatment. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the arterial blood pressure, the length of hospital stay, and the need for intubation or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the NAC group showed significantly lower MDA (median [interquartile range (IQR)]: 4.6 [1.9-10.6] vs. 6.8 [3.5-17.4] nmol/mL, P = 0.014) and higher TAC levels (median [IQR]: 0.7 [0.6-0.7] vs. 0.6 [0.6-06] mM/L, P < 0.001). The mortality rate and the need for mechanical ventilation were comparable in both groups (P = 0.601 and 0.505, respectively). However, the NAC group showed significant improvements of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (both P = 0.030). The duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the NAC group (P = 0.017). No adverse events were reported in patients who received NAC infusion. CONCLUSION: In patients with acute AP poisoning, the use of NAC mitigates oxidative stress and partially enhances clinical manifestations without inducing noticeable adverse effects."

As it may be present before airway obstruction, its early treatment may have a preventive role. This narrative review of the literature presents the role of mucus dysfunction in COPD, its pathophysiology, and the rationale for the use of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC can modify mucus rheology, improving clearance and reducing damage induced MUC5AC expression. It exerts a direct and indirect (glutathione replenishment) antioxidant mechanism; it interferes with inflammatory molecular pathways, including inhibition of nuclear factor-kB activation in epithelial airway cells and reduction in the expression of cytokine tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10. Some clinical experiences suggest that the adjunctive use of NAC may reduce symptoms and improve outcomes for patients with COPD. In conclusion, NAC may be a candidate drug for the early treatment of subjects at risk of COPD development."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is the main indication for the treatment of end-stage liver disease but have to face organ shortages. Using marginal donors is an option to increase the donor pool. Previous studies showed that the graft procured using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) provides a longer survival compared to perfusion with standard solutions, especially in marginal liver donors. We now evaluate the effect of NAC perfusion compared to control (no NAC protocol) at a 5-year follow-up, with a special focus on the overall survival (OS) and graft survival. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective review of the OS and graft survival among NAC and control group, with a sub-stratification based on the LT indication. RESULTS: 140 donors were enrolled: 69 in the NAC protocol and 71 in the control group. The 5-year OS was 84% in the NAC protocol compared to 63% in the control (P = .0045). In LT for HCC, the OS at 5 years was 80% and 55% in the study group and control group, respectively (P = .04), with no statistical difference in the RFS (P = .46). Furthermore, in cost analysis, the resources needed for the NAC protocol is negligible compared to the control group. Beneficial tendency of NAC protocol application has been seen in the other organs (lungs, hearts, pancreas, kidney and intestine) CONCLUSION: The application of NAC infusion in liver donors improves the overall survival of the recipient, especially in the HCC and HCV LT indications.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of acute organophosphate (OP) poisoning has steadily increased in developing countries. Many studies showed that oxidative stress could have a significant role in its mechanism. The current study aimed to evaluate the role of N acetylcysteine (NAC) as an antioxidant in acute OP poisoned. A randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted in the period from the beginning of January 2022 to the end of June 2022. The study included 56 acute OP poisoned patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Poison Control Center of Ain Shams University Hospitals within 6 h after the exposure. The patients were randomly allocated in two equal groups; group (A): received the standard treatment plus NAC in a total dose of 300 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) while group (B) received the standard treatment. Then both groups were compared as regards clinical parameters, laboratory investigations, ECG, and outcomes. Baseline parameters were comparable between the groups. However, NAC treatment significantly elevated concentrations of both serum catalase and glutathione peroxidase levels at 24 h, it did not significantly affect the total dose of atropine required, duration of atropine and oximes treatment or need for mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Mortality was lower in the NAC group (2 out of 28) than the standard treatment-only group (5 out of 28) but the difference was not statistically significant. This trial found that NAC improved antioxidant enzyme levels including serum CAT and GPX but did not affect clinically relevant outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Half the global tuberculosis health burden is due to post-tuberculosis lung disease. Host-directed therapies have been proposed to reduce this burden. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) provides the conditionally essential amino acid cysteine required for synthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant thiol. We recently reported clinical outcomes of a trial of adjunctive NAC in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, finding that NAC improved the secondary endpoint of recovery of lung function. Here we report the effects of NAC on biomarkers of oxidation, inflammation, and infection in that trial. METHODS: 140 adults with moderate or far-advanced pulmonary tuberculosis were randomly assigned to standard tuberculosis treatment with or without NAC 1200 mg twice daily for months 1-4. Sputum and blood samples were obtained at specified intervals to measure total glutathione, MTB-induced cytokines, hemoglobin, whole blood mycobactericidal activity (WBA), and sputum MTB burden. RESULTS: NAC treatment rapidly increased total glutathione (P<.0001), but levels did not reach those of healthy volunteers (P<.001). NAC reduced MTB-induced TNF-α (P =.011) without affecting IL-10, and accelerated the recovery of hemoglobin in participants with low values on entry. NAC did not affect killing in ex vivo whole blood culture but did slow the clearance of MTB from sputum (P=0.003). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive NAC showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects consistent with the amelioration of immunopathology seen in preclinical models. Two biomarkers of antimicrobial activity showed discordant results; neither demonstrated the enhanced antimicrobial effects seen preclinically. The reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation by NAC may explain its effects on the recovery of lung function post-TB.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on testicular hypoxia caused by varicocele, focusing specifically on the regulation of genes related to apoptosis and oxidative stress in the testes of mature Wistar rats. Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups: Control (Sham), hypoxia, testicular hypoxia treated with NAC (Hypoxia + NAC), and healthy animals treated with NAC. After the 8-week treatment period, testicular histopathology and the levels of oxidative stress markers-superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA)-in serum were examined. The expression of Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA was analyzed using immunocytochemistry and RT-qPCR assays, while the apoptosis rate was determined using the TUNEL method. Histopathological evaluations showed that parameters such as Johnsen's score, epithelium width, and seminiferous tubule diameter indicated significant improvement in the Hypoxia + NAC group compared to the Hypoxia group. NAC administration resulted in elevated serum levels of GPx and SOD, accompanied by a reduction in MDA levels (p < 0.003). Furthermore, the study revealed that NAC decreased Bax expression and enhanced Bcl-2 gene and protein expression compared to the varicocele group (p < 0.05). Additionally, NAC administration significantly decreased the rate of apoptosis in germ cells (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that NAC administration can mitigate testicular damage induced by hypoxia from varicocele in rats, primarily due to its antioxidant properties."

Azithromycin and Doxycycline sensitivity and the ability of biofilm formation of C. acnes isolated from all patients were assessed before and after adding the 3 agents. Azithromycin and Doxycycline sensitivity was improved after adding the 3 agents and the ability of biofilm formation of C. acnes was also reduced. Isotretinoin, salicylic acid, and NAC can be promising adjuvants in treating acne vulgaris by their anti-microbial effect in reducing biofilm formation and improving antibiotic sensitivity.

Regularly using ADAMTS13-containing products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for long-term prophylaxis is the most important treatment to prevent thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) episodes. Here, we identified novel pathogenic mutations of ADAMTS13 in our patients who experienced severe acute renal failure. Infections can trigger acute hemolytic episodes, and if the initiation of FFP therapy is delayed, this leads to severe organ dysfunction, as in our case. We have shown that regular use of products containing ADAMTS13 can reverse TMA episodes and long-term morbidity and mortality.

Since most drugs are metabolized by liver enzymes, the liver is at risk for hepatotoxicity. Although DILI has a low incidence in clinical practice, it remains a critical consideration for patients on potentially hepatotoxic medications. Acetaminophen is the most commonly implicated drug in DILI cases and is prioritized in toxicology screenings. Effective management of DILI requires the prompt discontinuation of the offending drug and supportive care. This case report discusses a 65-year-old male patient who developed elevated liver enzymes three weeks after starting tuberculosis treatment, raising suspicion of DILI. This report explores the diagnostic process, management strategies, and therapeutic role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), emphasizing its mechanism of action, current clinical applications, and potential future uses in treating DILI."

A critical disparity in the CRCI field is that most pre-clinical studies have been conducted on young cancer-free male rodents, although CRCI predominantly affects breast cancer and ovarian cancer women survivors. Since oxidative stress is widely implicated in the development of CRCI, we developed an ovarian cancer xenograft rat model of CRCI in Cr:NIH-RNU female rats to examine whether administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevents cisplatin-induced CRCI without altering its anti-cancer efficacy. In vitro, delayed treatment with NAC (10 h) following cisplatin treatment in the human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3.ip1 did not decrease cisplatin's anti-cancer efficacy while mitigating hippocampal dendritic branching damage and neuronal apoptosis. Rats received subcutaneous and intraperitoneal implantation of SKOV3.ip1 cells. Rats received one cisplatin (5 mg/kg) injection every two weeks for a total of four cycles, with or without NAC (250 mg/kg/day), given for five consecutive days during cisplatin treatment. NAC was administered 10 h after cisplatin, based on our in vitro data. Cognitive testing was performed six to seven weeks after treatment cessation. In vivo, cognitive impairments were observed in tumor-bearing rats in the vehicle and cisplatin-treatment groups, while delayed NAC prevented cognitive impairments. Delayed NAC administration did not affect cisplatin-induced tumor volume reduction. Our study supports using NAC to mitigate cisplatin-induced CRCI through the novel development of an ovarian cancer rodent model. This study highlights the importance of developing clinically relevant tumor-bearing models to elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with CRCI, which will aid in identifying potential therapeutic agents for preventing CRCI."

      "abstract": "Cisplatin (CIS) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent primarily used to treat hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, including lymphomas, sarcomas, and some carcinomas. Patients receiving this treatment for tumors outside the nervous system develop cognitive impairment. Alterations in the kynurenine pathway (KP) following CIS treatment suggest that certain KP metabolites may cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to increased production of the neuromodulator kynurenic acid (KYNA), which is associated with cognitive impairment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of modulating brain KYNA levels by the administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an inhibitor of kynurenine aminotransferase II (KATII), an enzyme responsible for KYNA biosynthesis on the cognitive and neuromuscular deficits induced by CIS. Female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, NAC (300 mg/day/8 days), CIS (3 mg/kg i.p/5 days), and NAC + CIS (both treatments co-administered in parallel). Seven days after the last CIS administration, cognitive performance, muscle strength, brain KYNA levels, KATII activity, and brain tissue redox profile (lipid peroxidation and oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio) were assessed. CIS did not affect short-term memory but induced long-term memory deficits and reduced muscle strength, effects which were prevented by NAC co-administration. CIS decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio and the number of cells in the brain cortex while it increased lipid peroxidation, KYNA levels, and marginal KATII activity. All these effects were attenuated by the co-administration of NAC. These findings suggest that NAC mitigates the side effects of CIS, such as chemo-brain and muscle weakness, by improving the redox imbalance and modulating KYNA levels by limiting its non-enzymatic production by reactive oxygen species (ROS).",

This study investigated the effects of different N-acetylcysteine (NAC) concentrations on the cryopreservation of semen from Qianbei Ma goats. Semen samples were collected from five bucks with motility rates above 80 %. The treatment groups were diluted 20-fold in extenders containing 3 or 9 mM NAC and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, whereas the control group did not include NAC. After thawing, the sperm motility, antioxidant gene expression, enzyme activity, and cell structure were analysed. The NAC-treated groups showed improved post-thaw sperm motility. The 9 mM NAC group presented the highest catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase activities, lowest ROS levels, and fewest apoptotic sperms. Moreover, the 3 mM NAC group presented the highest superoxide dismutase activity and L-cysteine levels and the lowest malondialdehyde levels. Additionally, sperm membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly higher in the NAC-treated group than that in the control. Further analysis of antioxidant and apoptotic gene expression in the treated sperm revealed that the 9 mM NAC group presented significantly greater CAT and GPX4 expression than the control and 3 mM NAC groups, whereas the apoptotic genes BAX and Caspase3 were elevated in the control group compared to both the NAC groups. In summary, adding NAC to semen extenders enhanced antioxidant gene expression, increased enzyme activity, and improved post-thaw semen quality, with the 9 mM NAC treatment showing the optimal effects.",

It also poses a risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, underscoring the importance of identifying effective treatments. N-acetylcysteine, an inhibitor of glutathione depletion, shows promise in modulating intracellular glutathione biosynthesis and combating oxidative stress, making it a potentially beneficial therapy for liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This study assesses the impact of N-acetylcysteine on HepG2 cells which were induced into fatty liver cells was evaluated. HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM and seeded onto six-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells. Following a 24-h incubation period, the cells were exposed to a medium inducing fat accumulation. Subsequently, the cells were treated with varying concentrations of N-acetylcysteine for 48 h. Some plates were utilized for Real-Time-PCR tests, while others underwent Oil Red staining. The findings indicated a significant increase in the expression of fatty acid β-oxidation genes in the group treated with 10mM N-acetylcysteine (p < 0.05), along with reduced expression of lipogenesis-related genes (p < 0.05) in N-acetylcysteine-treated groups. Analysis of apoptotic gene expression revealed decreased BAX expression but increased BCL2 expression in the N-acetylcysteine-treated groups. Oil Red staining demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in lipid droplets compared to the control group. This study's results suggest that N-acetylcysteine has the potential to decrease lipid droplets and modulate lipid metabolism effectively.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is associated with systemic complications, including the development of pulmonary injury, characterized mainly by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue. This process is driven by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, both caused and exacerbated by hyperglycemia. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glycine, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, offer potential therapeutic benefits in mitigating diabetes-induced lung injury. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the effects of supplementation by either NAC or glycine or their combination on reducing lung injury in rats with type 1 diabetes Materials and methods: The study used 30 adult Wistar albino rats (10 weeks old, weighing between 180 g and 380 g). Six of them were used as controls, while 24 adult rats (10 weeks old, 180-380 g) with type 1 diabetes, induced through a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 55 mg/kg, were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: control (CTL), diabetic (Db), NAC treatment (diabetic+NAC), glycine treatment (diabetic+glycine), and combined NAC and glycine treatment (diabetic+NAC+glycine). NAC (100 mg/kg) and glycine (250 mg/kg) were administered orally for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, lung tissues were collected for histopathological examination. Qualitative, semi-quantitative, and stereological histological analysis was used to analyze structural changes in the lung tissue. Semi-quantitative scoring was carried out to evaluate the extent of inflammation, while stereological analysis was performed to determine the volume density of alveolar spaces and septal connective tissue. The semi-quantitative scoring included scores ranging from 0 (absent), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). RESULTS: Qualitative histological analysis revealed pronounced inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs of untreated diabetic rats, characterized by thickened alveolar septa and immune cell infiltration. Both treatments with NAC and glycine individually reduced inflammation and fibrosis compared to untreated diabetic rats. The greatest improvement was observed in the NAC+glycine group, where the alveolar structure appeared almost normal, with minimal inflammation. Semiquantitative analysis showed statistically significant differences in peribronchial and peribrochiolar infiltrates between the diabetic group (2.16±0.47) and the control group (0.33±0.21, p=0.026). The combination of NAC and glycine significantly reduced peribronchial and peribronchiolar infiltrates (0.33±0.33, p=0.026) compared to the diabetic group. Similarly, septal inflammatory infiltrates were significantly lower in the NAC+glycine group (1±0.36) compared to diabetic rats (3.33±0.33, p=0.004). Total airway inflammatory infiltration was also significantly reduced in the NAC+glycine group (1.33±0.33, p=0.002) compared to the diabetic group (5.5±0.5). CONCLUSION: As the combination of NAC and glycine demonstrated protective effects against lung inflammation and fibrosis in diabetic rats, a synergistic effect of NAC and glycine in mitigating pulmonary complications associated with type 1 diabetes may be suggested. These findings warrant further exploration of the combination for managing diabetic lung disease and potentially other fibrotic conditions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Postmenopausal women are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, which are aggravated by obesity. Although estrogen provides cardiometabolic protection, chronic high-dose treatment could be harmful. This study investigated the efficacy of combined N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and low-dose estrogen treatment against cardiometabolic dysfunction in female estrogen-deprived obese rats with cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. METHODS: Bilateral ovariectomized (O) female Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet (H) for 12 weeks. Then, rats were treated for 4 weeks with one of the following: vehicle (OH; sesame oil), regular-dose estrogen (E; 50 μg/kg/d), low-dose estrogen (e; 25 μg/kg/d), NAC (N; 100 mg/kg/d), or combined low-dose estradiol with NAC (eN). All rats then underwent cardiac I/R injury, and the left ventricle (LV) function and mitochondrial function were investigated (n = 6/group). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's least significant difference post hoc test. RESULTS: Body weight, visceral fat, plasma glucose, and plasma cholesterol were significantly increased with impaired LV function and heart rate variability in OH rats. OH-E rats had decreased plasma insulin and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance index. Both OH-E and OH-eN rats had similarly improved heart rate variability and LV function. During cardiac I/R, OH-E and OH-eN rats had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and attenuated arrhythmias. Impaired cardiac mitochondrial function and infarct size were similarly reduced in OH-E and OH-eN rats. CONCLUSIONS: Combined NAC and low-dose estrogen treatment shares similar efficacy as regular-dose estrogen in attenuating cardiac dysfunction, cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction, and protecting the heart against I/R injury in estrogen-deprived obese insulin-resistant rats.",

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of NAC as an adjuvant therapy for RA. Methods A systematic search was conducted across five databases from inception to 1 August 2024, including CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Sensitivity analysis was performed when significant heterogeneity was identified. Results Four studies involving 204 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The results indicated that NAC alleviated disease activity in RA patients (Disease Activity Score 28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR): mean difference (MD) = 0.54). Additionally, NAC reduced inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): MD = 3.00). However, the beneficial effects of NAC on oxidative stress in RA patients were not observed. Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrated the efficacy of NAC in reducing inflammatory markers, improving joint tenderness, and swelling in patients with RA.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on oxidative stress (OS), intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) load, apoptosis, and autophagy of macrophages infected with H37Rv MTB. In addition, we explored the possible mechanism of action, to provide a rationale for the use of NAC in the treatment of tuberculosis. METHODOLOGY: We divided THP-1 macrophages into four groups: control, control + NAC, H37Rv, and H37Rv + NAC. OS, apoptosis, autophagy and intracellular MTB colony-forming unit (CFU) indexes were measured at 0, 4, 24, and 48 hours, respectively. Then, various indicator changes were systematically compared. RESULTS: The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), apoptosis rate, and LC3II/ β-actin ratio in the H37Rv group increased at 4 hours and reached their peak at 48 hours. The ROS and MDA in the H37Rv + NAC group were lower than those in the H37Rv group. CFU in the H37Rv + NAC group increased at 24 hours and decreased at 48 hours after treatment with NAC, relative to the H37Rv group. In addition, the H37Rv + NAC group showed a decrease in LC3II/β-actin ratio 48 hours after NAC treatment, compared to the H37Rv group. CONCLUSIONS: MTB infection can lead to an increase in macrophage OS, apoptosis, and autophagy levels. However, after treatment with NAC, the growth of MTB in macrophages is inhibited, and OS and autophagy levels are reduced. The antioxidant effect and inhibitory effect of NAC on MTB are related to MTB-mediated macrophage OS and autophagy.",

      "abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has established use as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose and treatment for pulmonary conditions and nephropathy. It plays a role in regulating oxidative stress and interacting with various cytokines including IL-1β, TNFα, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and NF-κB p65. The overexpression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is believed to contribute to chronic pain states by inducing inflammation and accelerating disease progression, favoring pain persistence in neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain conditions. Through a comprehensive review, we aim to explore the mechanisms and inflammatory pathways through which NAC may manage neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. Evidence suggests NAC can attenuate neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain through mechanisms such as inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhancing glutamate transport. Additionally, NAC may synergize with opioids and other pain medications, potentially reducing opioid consumption and enhancing overall pain management. Further research is needed to fully elucidate its therapeutic potential and optimize its use in pain management. As an adjuvant therapy, NAC shows potential for chronic pain management, offering significant benefits for public health."

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes a range of neurodevelopmental disabilities characterized by social interaction deficits, communication impairments, and repetitive behaviors. Previous studies have shown that pro-inflammatory conditions play a key role in ASD. Despite this, how oxidative stress and inflammation may contribute to ASD-related behaviors is still poorly understood. Here, we reported that increased levels of molecules related to inflammation are present in the cerebellum and peripheral blood (PB) of mice lacking Shank3b, an established model of syndromic ASD. In parallel, immune dysfunction was documented in the bone marrow (BM) and spleens of mutant mice. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment rescued inflammation in the cerebellum and PB and impaired the production of pro-inflammatory molecules in the BM and spleen. In addition, social impairment was counteracted in NAC-treated Shank3b-/- animals. Taken together, our results provide clear evidence of the key role of cerebellar oxidative stress and inflammation in the establishment of ASD-related behaviors. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of considering ASD as a systemic disorder."

      "abstract": "Smoking is one of the major contributors to airway injuries. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been proposed as a treatment or preventive measure for such injuries. However, the exact nature of the smoking-induced injury and the protective mechanism of NAC are not yet fully understood. Here, patient tissue-derived airway organoids for modeling smoking-induced injury, therapeutic investigation, and mechanism studies are developed. Airway organoids consist mainly of ciliated cells, together with basal cells, goblet cells, and myofibroblast-like cells. The organoids display apical-out and basal-in polarity and are enriched in beating cilia, which are sensitive to smoking challenge and NAC treatment. An algorithm is developed to measure ciliary beating activity by analyzing the altered beating pattern of cilia in response to nicotine challenge and NAC treatment. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed by airway organoids are involved in the mechanisms of nicotine-induced injury through the nicotine-nAChR pathway. In contrast to the common understanding that NAC has an antioxidative effect that mitigates airway damage, it is elucidated that NAC binding to nicotine can abolish the binding capacity of nicotine to nAChRs and thus prevent nicotine-induced injury. This study focuses on the advances and potential of humanized organoids in understanding biological processes, mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets.",

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has emerged as a potential adjunctive therapy with minimal side effects for patients with cytokine storm due to COVID-19. However, evidence supporting high-dose intravenous NAC in severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation is limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 who were admitted for acute respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300) with SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Queen Elizabeth Hospital from fifth July 2020 to 31st October 2022. Inclusion was limited to patients who required mechanical ventilation. High-dose NAC refers to a dosage of 10 g per day. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 28 days. Propensity-score matched analysis using logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Among the 136 patients analyzed, 42 (40.3%) patients received NAC. The unmatched NAC patients displayed a higher day-28 mortality (12 (28.6%) versus 4 (6.5%), p = 0.005) and fewer ventilator-free days (18.5 (0-23.0) versus 22.0 (18.3-24.0), p = 0.015). No significant differences were observed in ICU and hospital length of stays among survivors. In patients who were not treated with tocilizumab, those receiving NAC exhibited a trend toward a quicker reduction in C-reactive protein compared to those who did not receive NAC.After propensity score matching which included 64 patients with 33 (51.6%) receiving NAC, no significant differences were found in 28-day mortality, ventilator-free days, or ICU and hospital length of stay. After adjusting for potential confounders, logistic regression of the propensity score-matched population did not demonstrate that the use of NAC independently affected 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and receiving standard COVID-19 treatment, the addition of high-dose NAC did not lead to improved clinical outcomes."

Though prior meta-analyses generally support NAC's efficacy in reducing symptoms of craving, individual trials have found mixed results. The aims of this updated meta-analysis were to (1) examine the efficacy of NAC in treating symptoms of craving in individuals with SUD and (2) explore subgroup differences, risk of bias and publication bias across trials. Database searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov were conducted in June and July of 2023 to identify relevant randomized control trials (RCTs). The meta-analysis consisted of 9 trials which analysed data from a total of 623 participants. The most targeted substance in the clinical trials was alcohol (3/9; 33.3%), followed by tobacco (2/9; 22.2%) and multiple substances (2/9; 22.2%). Meta-analysis, subgroup analyses and leave-one-out analyses were conducted to examine the treatment effect on craving symptoms and adverse events (AEs). Risk of bias assessments, Egger's tests and funnel plot tests were conducted to examine the risk of bias and publication bias. NAC did not significantly outperform placebo in reducing symptoms of craving in the meta-analysis (SMD = 0.189, 95% CI = -0.015-0.393). Heterogeneity was very high in the meta-analysis (99.26%), indicating that findings may have been influenced by clinical or methodological differences in the study protocols. Additionally, results indicate that there may be publication bias present. Overall, our findings are contrary to those of prior meta-analyses, suggesting a limited impact of NAC on substance craving. However, the high heterogeneity and presence of publication bias identified warrants cautious interpretation of the meta-analytic outcomes.",

METHODS: A 9-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) was conducted on 53 (n=25 NAC, n=28 placebo) inpatients with AUD. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers, and hepatic parameters were analyzed in three-time moments. RESULTS: Seventeen (60.7%) subjects in placebo and sixteen (64%) in the NAC group completed the RCT. Levels of hepatic biomarkers significantly changed over time (p<0.001). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels at admission were lower in NAC group ((ppairwise=0.043). By the end of the study, both groups had similar GSSG levels (p=0.868), showing a reduction in GSSG levels in the placebo group. In the NAC group, a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and an increase in NPY levels in the end of the intervention were observed. Both groups showed similar mean survival time to relapse, treatment adherence and clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce the alcohol effects on oxidative stress and NPY parameters. However, our sample size may limit the generalizability of the results, especially for clinical outcomes. Future RCTs with less severe alcoholics and longer follow-up may be necessary to test if NAC could be helpful to reduce the mental health burden related to AUD."

      "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung condition and a leading cause of physical decline and death. COPD prevalence is expected to increase steadily in the coming years, and as a result, the healthcare and social burden of this condition will intensify. In this scenario, a patient-centric approach, the treatable trait (TT) strategy, based on the identification of traits that are clinically relevant, identifiable, monitorable and treatable, has emerged. The TT strategy, which considers behavioral/risk factors, as well as pulmonary and extrapulmonary traits, has shown to be a promising strategy in COPD management. This work reviews the TT strategy in COPD, giving special attention to the most relevant pulmonary traits, such as frequent productive cough, chronic bronchitis, type 2 inflammation, neutrophilic inflammation, lung hyperinflation, bronchiectasis, exacerbations and non-reversible airflow limitation. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a widely used mucolytic agent, might be a major player in this strategy. Indeed, through a thorough review of the literature, it has been possible to highlight that, besides being essential in the treatment of frequent productive cough, NAC could bring benefits in case of airflow limitations, airways inflammation, exacerbations and bronchiectasis. A clinical case in which the TT strategy was able to reduce symptoms and improve lung function and quality of life, minimizing unnecessary medication and side effects, is also presented. The identification of TTs and their proper treatment through personalized medicine remarkably ameliorates COPD management. Of note, the mucolytic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of NAC might have beneficial effects on several TTs.",

So far it has been described in nine pediatric and one adult patient. Therapeutic trials with copper histidinate failed to achieve any clinical improvement. Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of two novel patients, one of them diagnosed by gene analysis and his sib postmortally based on clinical characteristics. We demonstrate a therapeutic trial with acetylation therapy, consisting of N-acetylcysteine and ketogenic diet, in one of them. We provide biochemical data on N-acetylated amino acids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma before and after starting this treatment regimen. Our results indicate that ketogenic diet and N-acetylcysteine do not seem to normalize the concentrations of N-acetylated amino acids in CSF or plasma. The overall metabolic pattern shows a trend toward lowered levels of N-acetylated amino acids in CSF and to a lesser extent in plasma. Although there are some assumptions, the function of AT-1 is still not clear and further studies are needed to better understand mechanisms underlying this complex disorder."

Thus, we conducted an uptodated meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of NAC against depression. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials where NAC was used to treat depression. The present study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Embase (Ovid), and Cochrane were searched for relevant articles. A random-effects model was used to evaluate the primary outcome-efficacy of NAC in ameliorating depression. RESULTS: This review included 12 studies (904 patients with depression). The daily dose of NAC in the included studies ranged from 1000 to 3000 mg. The duration of NAC treatment ranged from 8 to 24 weeks. A significant difference was noted between NAC and placebo in terms of the change in mean depression score from baseline to treatment conclusion (standardized mean difference = -0.24; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = -0.44 to -0.05; I2 = 45 %; P = .02). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that adjunctive NAC can ameliorate depressive symptoms in patients with psychiatric problems, particularly bipolar disorder. However, large-scale clinical trials were needed to substantiate our results due to the wide CI value.",

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been proposed as a potential chemoprotective agent against CIPN due to its antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of oral NAC in preventing and controlling taxane-induced neuropathy in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: This randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 80 breast cancer patients undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy. Participants were divided into 2 groups: an intervention group receiving 1200 mg of oral NAC in divided doses per day and a placebo group. Patients were evaluated for neuropathy grade and functional status at 1 and 12 weeks postintervention. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed no significant difference in the incidence and severity of neuropathy between the intervention and placebo groups at 1 ( P =0.328) and 12 weeks ( P =0.569) postchemotherapy. Baseline characteristics such as age, number of treatment cycles, and disease stage were similar between groups, indicating a homogeneous population. CONCLUSIONS: Oral NAC at a dose of 1200 mg per day did not significantly reduce the incidence or severity of taxane-induced neuropathy. These findings suggest that the oral bioavailability of NAC may be insufficient to exert a protective effect and that future studies should consider alternative dosing strategies or routes of administration. The need for further research to optimize NAC's chemoprotective role in CIPN remains evident.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to adverse experiences during early life is associated with an increased risk of psychopathology during adolescence. In a previous study, we demonstrated that neonatal maternal separation (NMS) combined with social isolation led to impulsive and depressive-like behaviors in male adolescents. Additionally, it significantly reduced the expression of excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) in the hippocampus. Building upon this work, we investigated the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor to glutathione, in early-life stress (ELS) model rats and in EAAC1-/- mice. EAAC1 plays a dual role in transporting both glutamate and cysteine into neurons. Our findings revealed that female adolescents subjected to in the ELS model also exhibited behavioral defects similar to those of males. NAC injection rescued depressive-like behaviors in both male and female NMS models, but it improved impulsive behavior only in males. Furthermore, we observed increased reactive oxidative stress (ROS) and neuroinflammation in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and prefrontal cortex of NMS model rats, which were mitigated by NAC treatment. Notably, NAC reversed the reduced expression of EAAC1 in the vHPC of NMS model rats. In EAAC1-/- mice, severe impulsive and depressive-like behaviors were evident, and the NAC intervention improved only depressive-like behaviors. Collectively, our results suggest that ELS contributes to depression and impulsive behaviors during adolescence. Moreover, the cysteine uptake function of EAAC1 in neurons may be specifically related to depression rather than impulsive behavior.",

      "abstract": "Mucus clearance is crucial for airway protection, and its dysfunction leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by mucus hypersecretion (MHS) and impaired clearance. MUC5AC and MUC5B mucin proteins are key components of airway mucus, with MUC5AC being particularly responsive to environmental stimuli, making it a potential COPD biomarker. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a mucolytic agent with known effects on mucus viscosity and clearance, but its precise mechanisms in COPD remain unclear. This systematic review evaluated the impact of NAC on MHS in the airways, reporting significant inhibitory effects on MUC5AC and MUC5B gene and protein expression, as well as a reduction in the number of goblet cells. NAC has demonstrated efficacy in vitro and in animal models of MHS, including COPD models, but data on human bronchial tissue are lacking. This systematic review suggests that NAC acts as a mucolytic and a mucoregulator, directly inhibiting mucus secretion and goblet cell hyperplasia. Given the critical role of MHS in COPD progression, exacerbations, and mortality, these findings highlight the potential of NAC as a targeted therapy for hypersecretion COPD phenotypes. However, further studies are needed to confirm the results of this systematic review, even in human bronchial tissue, to provide translatable evidence in clinical settings. Understanding the intimate mechanism of NAC versus MHS regulation may pave the way for more effective treatments targeting airway mucus dysfunction in COPD, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing morbidity and mortality associated with chronic mucus hypersecretion.",

This study aimed to characterize the extra hepatic biliary tree of Mdr2-/- mice at various ages and to determine if injury can be repaired with the antioxidant and glutathione precursor N-acetyl-L-Cysteine treatment (NAC). We characterized extra hepatic bile ducts (EHBD)s at various ages from 2 to 40 weeks old FVB/N and Mdr2-/- mice. We examined the therapeutic potential of local NAC ex vivo using EHBD explants at early and late stages of injury; and systematic therapy by in vivo oral administration for 3 weeks. EHBD and liver sections were assessed by histology and immunofluorescent stains. Serum liver enzyme activities were analyzed, and liver spatial protein expression analysis was performed. Mdr2-/- mice developed progressive EHBD injury, similar to extrahepatic PSC. NAC treatment of ex vivo EHBD explants led to improved duct morphology. In vivo, oral administration of NAC improved liver fibrosis, and decreased liver enzyme activities. Spatial protein analysis revealed cell-type specific differential response to NAC, collectively indicating a transition from pro-apoptotic into proliferative state. NAC treatment should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic option for human cholangiopathies.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the possible protective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against Indum-tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticle (Nano-ITO) -induced pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) in rats, especially via modulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. Methods: In October 2019, 50 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into five groups (10 rats each) as follows: blank control group, saline control group, NAC control group (200 mg/kg), Nano-ITO group (receiving a repeated intratracheal dose of 6 mg/kg Nano-ITO) and NAC intervention group (pre-treated intraperitoneally with 200 mg/kg NAC 1.5 h before the administration of an intratracheal dose of 6 mg/kg Nano-ITO). The rats were exposed twice a week for 12 weeks. Rats were then euthanized under anesthesia, and their lungs were removed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. The comparison of indicators reflecting oxidative stress and pulmonary inflammation among groups was conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni's test. The effect of NAC on Nano-ITO induced NF-κB signaling pathway in rats was analyzed. Results: Histopathological examination of Nano-ITO exposed rats revealed diffuse alveolar damage, including PAP, cholesterol crystals, alveolar fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and alveolar emphysema. Immunohistochemical results of Nano-ITO exposed rats showed strong positive for nuclear factor κB p65 (NF-κB p65) and nuclear factor Kappa B inhibitory factor kinase (IKK-β) and weak positive for nuclear factor κB inhibitory protein α (IκB-α) in the nuclei of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells. Compared with blank control group, saline control group and NAC control group, the level of total protein (TP) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rats in Nano-ITO group was significantly increased (P<0.05), and the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) content and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were significantly increased (P<0.05), the levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the levels of NF-κB p65, IKK-β, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung tissue were significantly increased (P<0.05). Compared with Nano-ITO group, the levels of TP, T-AOC, MDA and TNF-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rats in NAC intervention group were significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the levels of NF-κB p65 and ROS in lung tissue were significantly decreased (P<0.05). Western blot results showed that compared with the control groups, the protein expressions of NF-κB p65 and IKK-β in the lung tissue of Nano-ITO group were increased, while the protein expression of IκB-α was decreased (P<0.05). Compared with Nano-ITO group, the protein expressions of NF-κB p65 and IKK-β in lung tissue of rats in NAC intervention group were decreased, while the protein expression of IκB-α was increased (P<0.05) . Conclusion: The study demonstrated that Nano-ITO might induce pulmonary toxicity through the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway, and NAC could antagonize the pulmonary toxicity of Nano-ITO by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of opioid addiction mainly involves the medical administration of methadone or other opioids, aimed at gradually reducing dependence and, consequently, the need for illicit opioid procurement. Thus, initiating opioid maintenance therapy with a lower level of dependence would be advantageous. There is compelling evidence indicating that opioids induce brain oxidative stress and associated glial activation, resulting in the dysregulation of glutamatergic homeostasis, which perpetuates drug intake. The present study aimed to determine whether inhibiting oxidative stress and/or neuroinflammation reduces morphine self-administration in an animal model of opioid dependence. METHODS: Morphine dependence, assessed as voluntary morphine self-administration, was evaluated in Wistar-derived UChB rats. Following an extended period of morphine self-administration, animals were administered either the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 40 mg/kg/day), the anti-inflammatory ibudilast (7.5 mg/kg/day) or the combination of both agents. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation were evaluated in the hippocampus, a region involved in drug recall that feeds into the nucleus accumbens, where the levels of the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and xCT were further assessed. RESULTS: Daily administration of either NAC or ibudilast led to a mild reduction in voluntary morphine intake, while the co-administration of both therapeutic agents resulted in a marked inhibition (-57%) of morphine self-administration. The administration of NAC or ibudilast markedly reduced both the oxidative stress induced by chronic morphine intake and the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus. However, only the combined administration of NAC + ibudilast was able to restore the normal levels of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the nucleus accumbens. CONCLUSION: Separate or joint administration of an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent reduced voluntary opioid intake, which could have translational value for the treatment of opioid use disorders, particularly in settings where the continued maintenance of oral opioids is a therapeutic option.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The management of endodontic infections is a complex challenge, mainly due to the involvement of diverse microorganisms and their by-products. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), and their combined application as intracanal medications in combating Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from E. coli. METHODS: A total of 60 single-rooted human teeth were carefully selected and divided into six groups. These tooth canals were deliberately exposed to E. faecalis (ATCC 29212) and E. coli (ATCC 25922) to induce biofilm formation. Subsequently, the specimens were treated with NAC, Ca(OH)2, or a combination of both substances. Three samples of the root canals were collected at three moments: the first sample (S1) was to confirm the initial contamination, the second sample (S2) was immediately post-instrumentation, and the third sample (S3) was collected after the use of the intracanal medication. The antimicrobial efficacy of these intracanal medications was assessed by enumerating colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). In addition to this, the kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay by Lonza was used to quantify LPS from E. coli. Data tested for normality; then, Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests were used, and Dunn's for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: The findings of this study showed significant reductions in the microbial load of E. faecalis and E. coli by S3. Notably, there were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups concerning these microorganisms. However, it was observed that only the combination of NAC and Ca(OH)2 led to a noteworthy decrease in the quantity of E. coli's LPS after 7-days, demonstrating a statistically significant difference from the other treatment groups. NAC + Ca(OH)2 combination, applied for a duration of 7-days, proved to be more suitable in reducing the presence of E. faecalis, E. coli, and LPS from E. coli within the context of endodontic infections.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic application of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as a treatment or adjunct therapy for various medical conditions. While its efficacy in treating acetaminophen overdose, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is well-established, emerging evidence suggests that NAC may also benefit a broader spectrum of illnesses due to its safety, simplicity, and affordability. A comprehensive review was conducted by searching PubMed, relevant books, and conference proceedings for publications discussing NAC about the specified health conditions. The clinically relevant data were analysed using the American Family Physician Evidence-Based Medicine Toolkit, following a standard integrated review methodology. NAC shows potential as an adjunctive treatment for a wide range of medical conditions, particularly chronic diseases. It may be beneficial for polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, male infertility, cataracts, glaucoma, dry eye syndrome, parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, stroke outcomes, non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although evidence for some conditions is less robust, NAC's therapeutic potential warrants further investigation. Given the aging population and the decline in glutathione levels, the use of NAC should be considered across a variety of medical conditions. This paper suggests that NAC supplementation could play a significant role in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with numerous chronic diseases."

      "abstract": "Liver diseases represent a worldwide health problem accountable for two million deaths per year. Oxidative stress is critical for the development of these diseases. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is effective in preventing liver damage, both in experimental and clinical studies, and evidence has shown that the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of NAC are related to its antioxidant nature and ability to modulate key signaling pathways. Here, we provide a comprehensive description of the beneficial effects of NAC in the treatment of liver diseases, addressing the first evidence of its role as a scavenger and precursor of reduced glutathione, along with studies showing its immunomodulatory action, as well as the ability of NAC to modulate epigenetic hallmarks. We searched the PubMed database using the following keywords: oxidative stress, liver disease, epigenetics, antioxidants, NAC, and antioxidant therapies. There was no time limit to gather all available information on the subject. NAC has shown efficacy in treating liver damage, exerting mechanisms of action different from those of free radical scavengers. Like different antioxidant therapies, its effectiveness and safety are related to the administered dose; therefore, designing new pharmacological formulations for this drug is imperative to achieve an adequate response. Finally, there is still much to explore regarding its effect on epigenetic marker characteristics of liver damage, turning it into a drug with broad therapeutic potential. According to the literature reviewed, NAC could be an appropriate option in clinical studies related to hepatic injury and, in the future, a repurposing alternative for treating liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown beneficial effects in both acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in preclinical and clinical studies. Different dosage and administration forms of NAC have specific pharmacokinetic properties that determine the temporal pattern of plasma concentrations of NAC and its active metabolites. Especially in acute situations with short-term NAC administration, appropriate NAC and glutathione (GSH) plasma concentrations should be timely ensured. For oral dosage forms, bioavailability needs to be established for the respective NAC formulation. Kidney function influences NAC pharmacokinetics, including a reduction of NAC clearance in advanced CKD. In addition, mechanisms of action underlying beneficial NAC effects depend on kidney function as well as comorbidities, both involving GSH deficiency, alterations in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent signaling, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disturbed mitochondrial bioenergetics. This also applies to nonrenal NAC mechanisms. The timing of preventive NAC administration in relation to potential injury is important. NAC administration seems most effective either preceding, or preceding and paralleling conditions that induce tissue damage. Furthermore, studies suggest that very high concentrations of NAC should be avoided because they could exert reductive stress. Delayed administration of NAC might interfere with endogenous repair mechanisms. In conclusion, studies on NAC treatment regimens need to account for both NAC pharmacokinetics and NAC molecular effects. Kidney function of the patient population and pathomechanisms of the kidney disease should guide rational NAC trial design. A targeted trial approach and biomarker-guided protocols could pave the way for the use of NAC in precision medicine."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-20% of women worldwide, with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia occurring in 50-70% of patients. Hyperinsulinemia exacerbates oxidative stress, contributing to PCOS pathogenesis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant and insulin sensitizer that shows promise as a therapeutic for PCOS. Our current study aimed to investigate the effects of NAC supplementation on endocrine-metabolic parameters in PCOS mice and its effect on ovulation induction (OI) efficacy in women with PCOS. METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice were orally administered letrozole (LE) to induce PCOS and then randomly divided into groups receiving daily oral administration of 160 mg/kg NAC (PCOS + NAC group), 200 mg/kg metformin (PCOS + Met group), or 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (drug solvent) (pure PCOS group) for 12 days. Healthy female mice served as pure controls. Estrous cycles were monitored during the intervention. Metabolic and hormone levels, ovarian phenotypes, antioxidant activity in ovarian tissues, and oxidative stress levels in oocytes were assessed post-intervention. Furthermore, a pragmatic, randomized, controlled clinical study was conducted with 230 PCOS women, randomly assigned to the NAC group (1.8 g/day oral NAC, n = 115) or the control group (n = 115). Patients in both groups underwent ≤ 3 cycles of OI with sequential LE and urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (uFSH). Cycle characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS: Similar to metformin, NAC supplementation significantly improved the estrous cycles and ovarian phenotypes of PCOS mice; reduced the LH concentration, LH/FSH ratio, and T level; and increased glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity. Notably, NAC significantly reduced oocyte ROS levels and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential in PCOS mice. Additionally, NAC significantly enhanced enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant activities in PCOS mouse ovaries, whereas metformin had no such effect. In the clinical trial, compared to women in the control group, women receiving NAC had significantly lower average uFSH dosage and duration (p < 0.005) and significantly greater clinical pregnancy rates per OI cycle and cumulative clinical pregnancy rates per patient (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: NAC supplementation improved endocrine-metabolic parameters in PCOS mice and significantly enhanced OI efficacy with sequential LE and uFSH in women with PCOS. Therefore, NAC could be a valuable adjuvant in OI for women with PCOS.",

The objective of this work was to observe the effects of NAC in the treatment of neonatal pneumonia, including its ability to reduce the clinical score, shorten the duration of the treatment, and improve the overall health condition of neonatal calves. For this study, calves were divided into two groups: a treatment group that received NAC and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, and a control group that received amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (antimicrobial only). The findings of this study indicate that NAC treatment significantly shortened the time to resolution (p < 0.001), compared to the results in the group without NAC treatment. Generally, NAC-supplemented therapy reduced the recovery time by more than 27 h (or slightly more than one day), compared to that in the antimicrobial-only group. Our study presents the first reported usage of NAC in therapy for respiratory disorders."

Methods: In March 2023, BEAS-2B cells were used as research object, an in vitro airway model exposed to ultrafine carbon black was constructed. A control group and three carbon black exposure groups (50, 100, 200 μg/ml) were set up, and the cells were treated with corresponding concentrations of ultrafine carbon black for 24 hours. In addition, the experiment was divided into control group, NAC+ control group, 100 μg/ml carbon black exposure group and NAC+ exposure group. The corresponding groups were treated with 2 mmol/L NAC for 1 h and 100 μg/ml ultrafine carbon black for 24 h, respectively. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was detected by chemical fluorescence method. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT), as well as the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected by colorimetry. The mRNA and protein expressions of autophagy-related genes[Atg5, Atg7, Beclin1, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B), p62 and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) ] and apoptosis-related genes [B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), Caspase3, Caspase9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) ] were determined by fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blot. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Results: Compared with the control group, the relative survival rates of BEAS-2B cells in 50, 100, 200 μg/ml carbon black exposure groups were significantly decreased, the levels of ROS and MDA were significantly increased, and the activities of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT were significantly decreased (P<0.05). The relative survival rate, ROS and MDA levels, SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities were significantly correlated with the exposure dose of ultrafine carbon black (r(s)=-0.755, 0.826, 0.934, -0.810, -0.880, -0.840, P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the relative expression levels of Atg5, Atg7, Beclin1, LC3B, p62, LAMP2, Bax, Caspase3, Caspase9, PARP1 mRNA and Atg5, Atg7, Beclin1, LC3BⅡ, p62, LAMP2, Bax, cleaved Caspase3 (C-Caspase3), cleaved Caspase9 (C-Caspase9), cleaved PARP1 (C-PARP1) protein and the ratio of LC3BⅡ/LC3BⅠ in 50, 100 and 200 μg/ml carbon black exposure groups were significantly increased, while the relative expression levels of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein were significantly decreased (P<0.05). The changes of the above indexes were significantly correlated with the exposure dose of carbon black (r(s)=0.892, 0.879, 0.944, 0.892, 0.828, 0.880, 0.814, 0.794, 0.931, 0.918, 0.813, 0.866, 0.774, 0.695, 0.918, 0.761, 0.794, 0.944, 0.833, 0.866, 0.905, -0.886, -0.748, P<0.05). Compared with 100 μg/ml carbon black exposure group, the relative survival rate, the activities of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT in NAC+exposure group were significantly increased, while the levels of ROS and MDA were significantly decreased, and the relative expression levels of LC3B, p62 and Caspase3 mRNA and protein as well as the ratio of LC3BⅡ/LC3BⅠ were significantly decreased, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the apoptosis rates of BEAS-2B cells in 50, 100, 200 μg/ml carbon black exposure groups were significantly increased (P<0.05), and there was a significant positive correlation between ultrafine carbon black exposure dose and cell apoptosis rate (r(s)=0.944, P<0.05). While compared with 100 μg/ml carbon black exposure group, the apoptosis rate of NAC+exposure group was significantly decreased, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05) . Conclusion: Cell autophagy and apoptosis may be important pathophysiological mechanisms of ultrafine carbon black-induced oxidative damage in BEAS-2B cells. NAC can alleviate the occurrence of BEAS-2B cell damage caused by ultrafine carbon black by regulating oxidative stress and the cascading autophagy and apoptosis pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) ranks as the fourth most prevalent psychiatric disorder, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as its mainstay pharmacological treatment. However, approximately 40 to 60% of patients do not adequately respond to initial treatment, highlighting the need for alternative options. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is one of the several medications that have been used in augmentation with SSRIs to enhance their efficacy. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of NAC, a glutamate-modulating agent, as an augmentation in the treatment of moderate to severe OCD. METHOD: We conducted a thorough search across PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and ProQuest to identify relevant trials published until December 2023. The primary outcome of interest was the mean difference between the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores before and after administrating augmented NAC among patients with moderate to severe OCD. Furthermore, we compared the occurrence of adverse drug events between the experimental and control groups. RESULTS: We included six randomized controlled trials with 195 patients. The results of our study indicated a positive outcome for the experimental group in terms of the total Y-BOCS score when using the medication for a period of five to eight weeks (p-Value = 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed for durations shorter than five weeks or longer than 12 weeks. Additionally, no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the obsession and compulsion Y-BOCS scores. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in terms of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Augmentation of NAC with SSRIs may benefit patients with moderate to severe OCD. However, it is necessary to conduct additional multi-center trials over extended periods to develop a comprehensive strategy for action.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of NAC for relieving dryness symptoms in SjD. METHODS: In this placebo-controlled double-blind trial, 60 adult SjD females (with low disease activity) were randomised to receive NAC (1,200 mg/day orally) or placebo. At baseline (D0), 30 days (D30) and 90 days (D90), all participants underwent the following evaluations: EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Xerostomia Inventory (XI), Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), unstimulated/stimulated salivary flow, Schirmer's test, and plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione and NAC. RESULTS: At inclusion, both groups were balanced for age, ethnicity, disease duration, ESSPRI, OSDI, XI, Schirmer's test, salivary flow, ESSDAI and topical/systemic treatments (p>0.05). No significant differences were observed between NAC and placebo groups on D30 and D90 regarding ESSPRI, XI, OSDI, LCQ, Schirmer's test, stimulated salivary flow, ESSDAI and topical/systemic treatments (p>0.05). Unstimulated salivary flow was significantly higher in the placebo group on D90 (p=0.018). NAC blood concentrations were significantly higher in the NAC group on D30 (p=0.018) and D90 (p<0.001), however, no differences were found in TBARS and glutathione. Further analysis showed decrease≥1 in ESSPRI in the NAC compared with placebo group on D30 (p=0.045), a result not found on D90 (p=0.696). CONCLUSIONS: NAC is recommended as a rescue therapy for SjD. However, our well-designed study provides novel evidence demonstrating its inefficacy for improving dryness symptoms or reducing oxidative stress. CLINICALTRIALS: gov-NCT04793646.",

      "abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a well-established antioxidant that offers exciting opportunities for intestinal health in weaned piglets, while the effects of NAC on muscle and liver has not been fully characterized. Therefore, the present study was performed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with NAC on muscle and liver in weaned piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Twenty-four piglets (24-day-old) were randomly assigned to three treatment groups, the piglets in the control (CTR) and LPS- challenged (LPS) groups were fed the basal diet and those in the LPS+ NAC group was fed the basal diet supplemented with 500 mg/kg NAC. The animal trial lasted for 21 days. At the end of the trial, piglets in the LPS and LPS+ NAC groups were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (100 μg/kg body weight) and piglets in the CTR group were administrated with an equal volume of normal saline. 3 h later, the blood was collected and tissue samples were obtained after 6 h of LPS or normal saline treatment. The results showed that the level of IL-1β, and the mRNA levels of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in the liver were up-regulated, and the mRNA levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), total glutathione (T-GSH), and the ratio of total protein to DNA in the liver were decreased under LPS challenge (P < 0.05). At the same time, LPS increased the level of H2O2 and decreased the content of T-GSH and DNA in the longissimus dorsi and gastrocnemius muscles (P < 0.05). In addition, the percentage of monocytes and the level of epidermal growth factor (EGF) were down-regulated in the LPS treatment (P < 0.05). Interestingly, dietary NAC supplementation reversed the above changes induced by LPS (P < 0.05). Furthermore, NAC might alleviate the muscle and liver injury in LPS-challenged piglets by regulating the expression of genes related to the type I interferon signaling pathway, as well as hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) and nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf-2). Our findings suggested that dietary supplementation with NAC could benefit the health of muscle and liver in LPS-challenged weaned piglets."

The efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (an antioxidant and mucolytic agent) for patients with mild-to-moderate COPD is uncertain. In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 968 patients with mild-to-moderate COPD to treatment with N-acetylcysteine (600 mg, twice daily) or matched placebo for two years. Eligible participants were 40-80 years of age and had mild-to-moderate COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] to forced vital capacity ratio <0.70 and an FEV1 ≥ 50% predicted value after bronchodilator use). The coprimary outcomes were the annual rate of total exacerbations and the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 24 months in FEV1 before bronchodilator use. COPD exacerbation was defined as the appearance or worsening of at least two major symptoms (cough, expectoration, purulent sputum, wheezing, or dyspnoea) persisting for at least 48 hours. Assessment of exacerbations was conducted every three months, and lung function was performed annually after enrolment. The difference between the N-acetylcysteine group and the placebo group in the annual rate of total exacerbation were not significant (0.65 vs. 0.72 per patient-year; relative risk [RR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.02; P = 0.10). There was no significant difference in FEV1 before bronchodilator use at 24 months. Long-term treatment with high-dose N-acetylcysteine neither significantly reduced the annual rate of total exacerbations nor improved lung function in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD.

      "abstract": "Cognitive deficits frequently arise after traumatic brain injury. The murine closed head injury (CHI) models these deficits since injured mice cannot acquire Barnes maze. Dosing of minocycline plus N-acetylcysteine beginning 12 hours post-CHI (MN12) restores Barnes maze acquisition by an unknown mechanism. Increased hippocampal synaptic efficacy is needed to acquire Barnes maze, synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) models this increased synaptic efficacy in vitro . LTP has an early phase (E-LTP) lasting up to one hour that is mediated by second messengers that is followed by a late phase (L-LTP) that needs new synthesis of protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ). PKMζ has constitutive kinase activity because it lacks the autoinhibitory regulatory domain found in other PKCs. Due to its constitutive activity, the amount of PKMζ kinase activity is determined by PKMζ protein levels. We report that CHI bilaterally decreases PKMζ levels in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampus. MN12 increases CA1 PKMζ expression. CHI inhibits E-LTP in slices from the ipsilesional hippocampus and inhibits L-LTP in slices from both hippocamppi. MN12 treatment reestablishes both E-LTP and L-LTP in slices from the injured MN12-treated hippocampus. The restoration of L-LTP from injured MN12-treated hippocampus is mediated by PKMζ because L-LTP is blocked by the specific PKMζ inhibitor, ζ-stat. Hippocampal ζ-stat infusions also prevents Barnes maze acquisition in injured, MN12-treated mice. These data suggest that post-injury minocycline plus N-acetylcysteine targets PKMζ to improve synaptic plasticity and cognition in mice with closed-head injury."

The pathogenesis of CVB is not fully understood, and effective antiviral therapy is not available. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the classic antioxidant, has been used in clinical practice for several decades to treat various medical conditions. In this study, the anti-CVB effect of NAC was investigated. We show that NAC dramatically suppressed viral replication and alleviated cardiac injury induced by CVB3. To further study the antiviral mechanism of NAC, RNA-sequencing was performed for CVB3-infected cells with NAC treatment. We found that eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) is one of the most upregulated genes in CVB3-infected cells. However, EEF1A2, the highly homologous isoform of EEF1A1, remains unchanged. EEF1A1 expression was significantly suppressed by NAC treatment in CVB3-infected cells, while EEF1A2 was not affected. eEF1A1 knockdown significantly inhibited CVB3 replication, implicating that eEF1A1 facilitates viral replication. Importantly, we show that eEF1A1, which was not expressed in the myocardia of newborn mice, was significantly upregulated by CVB3 infection. NAC markedly downregulated the expression of eEF1A1 but not eEF1A2 in the myocardia of CVB3-infected mice. Furthermore, NAC accelerated eEF1A1 degradation by promoting autophagy in CVB3-infected cells. We show that p62, one of the critical adaptors of autophagic targets, interacts with eEF1A1 and was downregulated in CVB3-infected cells upon NAC treatment. Taken together, this study demonstrated that NAC shows a potent anti-CVB effect through the downregulation of eEF1A1.",

The aim of our research was to investigate the effect of topically applied NAC-enriched hydrogels on wound healing in a leptin-deficient murine wound model. Four excisional wounds were created on the backs of 20 db/db mice and were subsequently treated with hydrogels containing NAC at concentrations of 5%, 10% and 20% or placebo (control). Healing was monitored for 28 days; photographs of the wounds were taken on every third day. Wound tissues were harvested on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 to undergo histological examinations. Wounds treated with 5% NAC showed improved wound closure speed accompanied by an increased dermal proliferation area on microscopic assessment compared with other groups. Higher concentrations of NAC failed to show a beneficial effect on wound healing. 5% NAC improved early stages of wound healing in a murine model of type II DM by increasing wound closure speed, likely mediated by improved dermal proliferation.",

A retrospective single-center study at Bursa City Hospital involves patients over 50 years of age with distal radius fractures treated between January 2021 and December 2023. A total of 60 patients (mean age, 62.8 ± 5.1 years; 26 males and 34 females) were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: the NAC group (31 patients receiving 600-mg NAC daily for 3 months) and the control group (29 patients with no prophylactic medication). CRPS-1 diagnosis was based on Budapest criteria during multiple follow-up visits. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), total oxidant status (TOS), and total antioxidant status (TAS) were measured at baseline and study end point. CRPS-1 positive patients had significantly higher levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1 (P < .001 for all), higher TOS (P < .001) and oxidative stress index (P < .001), and lower TAS (P < .001) compared with CRPS-1 negatives. The incidence of CRPS-1 was significantly lower in the NAC group (9.7%) compared with the control group (31.0%; P = .039). Logistic regression indicated a 78% reduction in CRPS-1 odds ratio with NAC treatment (odds ratio, 0.219 [95% confidence interval, 0.053-0.895]; P = .0322). NAC significantly reduced end-point levels and changes in IL-6 (P < .001), TNF-α (P < .001), and IL-1 (P = .038) and improved oxidative stress markers, showing higher TAS (P < .001), lower TOS (P < .001), and oxidative stress index (P < .001) compared with controls. NAC significantly reduced the risk of developing CRPS-1 by decreasing levels of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. This study highlights NAC's potential as a preventive treatment for CRPS-1 and emphasizes the importance of early intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative damage to the ovaries is the primary cause of impaired reproductive functions in female animals. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in reducing oxidative damage in the ovaries of female rabbits. METHODS AND RESULTS: Female rabbit ovaries were treated in vitro with varying concentrations of D-galactose (D-gal): 0, 5, 10, and 15 mg/mL, and it was found that 10 mg/mL D-gal significantly disrupted follicular structures, causing disarray in granulosa cell arrangements and significantly reducing T-SOD and GSH levels (p < 0.01). Consequently, we selected 10 mg/mL D-gal to establish an ovarian failure model. These models were treated with multiple doses of NAC (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 mg/mL). The results revealed that the disruption in granulosa cell arrangement caused by 10 mg/mL D-gal was effectively alleviated by 0.1 mg/mL NAC compared to the D-gal treatment group. Furthermore, 10 mg/mL D-gal significantly (p < 0.01) reduced GSH, T-SOD, and catalase (CAT) levels in the ovaries. However, 0.1 mg/mL NAC effectively (p < 0.01) suppressed these adverse effects. Moreover, the current results showed that 10 mg/mL D-gal alone significantly (p < 0.01) downregulated the expression of Nrf2, GPX, PRDX4, GSR, SOD1, and TAF4B, whereas 0.1 mg/mL NAC counteracted these suppressive effects (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It could be concluded that NAC may delay ovarian failure by reducing D-gal-induced ovarian oxidative damage in female rabbit, suggested NAC could be a promising therapeutic agent for protecting against ovarian failure and potentially delaying ovarian failure in female rabbits.",

We assessed whether NAC reduce craving rating as compared to a placebo in SUD patients. Secondary outcomes were withdrawal symptoms (WS), side effects (SE) and drop-outs. Estimates are presented as standardized mean differences (SMD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Eleven RCTs were included. NAC reduced craving rating (SMD -0.61 (-1.17, -0.06), p = 0.03, I2 = 85%), with no differences in the subgroup analysis according to the drug addiction (alcohol, cocaine, poly-drugs, amphetamine, nicotine) (p = 0.98). Among the secondary outcomes, for WS data showed no significant difference between groups (SMD -0.18 (-0.43, 0.08), p = 0.17); for SE no substantial difference was observed between the two treatment groups (RR = 1.06 (0.89-1.27), p = 0.52, I2 = 0%); for dropouts the results are in favor of the placebo but no statistically significant (RR 1.17 (0.85, 1.61), p = 0.34; I2 = 0%). CONCLUSION: NAC seem to reduce craving rating in SUD patients, but evidence is weak. More studies are needed to confirm this finding."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced adverse symptoms affect patients' quality of life (QoL) during treatment. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of drug-induced adverse effects could help prevent them. As current drugs have limited effects in halting the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients are required to take these drugs over a long period. The main obstacles to long-term compliance are drug-elicited side effects that deteriorate patient QoL. OBJECTIVE: Donepezil, the most popular acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) drug for AD, induces various side effects, especially at high doses. This study aimed to identify a drug that can attenuate the side effects of donepezil and investigate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Five-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats received daily oral donepezil and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for four weeks. General symptoms following administration were monitored daily to address drug-related adverse effects. Cytosolic calcium influx and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after drug treatment were measured in vitro using C2C12 myotubes. RESULTS: High-dose donepezil induced numerous adverse symptoms in male and female rats, which were markedly attenuated by co-treatment with NAC. NAC significantly reduced both acute and chronic muscle-related symptoms caused by donepezil. Additionally, in vitro studies showed that high-dose donepezil increased ROS and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels in muscle cells, contributing to these adverse effects. NAC co-treatment dramatically reduced ROS and [Ca2+]i levels in muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with NAC effectively diminishes the adverse effects elicited by donepezil by regulating ROS and [Ca2+]i levels in the skeletal muscle, which could contribute to improving donepezil treatment in patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is a serious complication of thoracic tumor radiotherapy that substantially affects the quality of life of cancer patients. Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the occurrence and progression of RIHD, which prompted our investigation of an innovative approach for treating RIHD using antioxidant therapy. METHODS: We used 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats as experimental animals and H9C2 cells as experimental cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used as an antioxidant to treat H9C2 cells after X-ray irradiation in this study. In the present study, the extent of cardiomyocyte damage caused by X-ray exposure was determined, alterations in oxidation/antioxidation levels were assessed, and changes in the expression of genes related to mitochondria were examined. The degree of myocardial tissue and cell injury was also determined. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays, and glutathione (GSH) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) assays were used to assess cell oxidation/antioxidation. Flow cytometry was used to determine the mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used to elucidate the expression of mitochondria-related genes in myocardial tissue induced by X-ray exposure. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to verify the expression of differentially expressed genes. RESULTS: X-ray irradiation damaged myocardial tissue and cells, resulting in an imbalance of oxidative and antioxidant substances and mitochondrial damage. NAC treatment increased cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) levels (P=0.02) and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (P=0.02) in cardiomyocytes. It also reduced the level of ROS (P=0.002) and increased the levels of GSH (P=0.04) and Mn-SOD (P=0.01). The mitochondrial membrane potential was restored (P<0.001), and mPTP opening was inhibited (P<0.001). Transcriptome sequencing and subsequent validation analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of mitochondria-related genes in myocardial tissue induced by X-ray exposure, but antioxidant therapy did not reverse the related DNA damage. CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidants mitigated radiation-induced myocardial damage to a certain degree, but these agents did not reverse the associated DNA damage. These findings provide a new direction for future investigations by our research group, including exploring the treatment of RIHD-related DNA damage."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is an established risk factor for later-life neuropsychiatric vulnerability, including mood- and anxiety-related symptoms. The psychotropic effects of THC on affect and anxiogenic behavioral phenomena are known to target the striatal network, particularly the nucleus accumbens, a neural region linked to mood and anxiety disorder pathophysiology. THC may increase neuroinflammatory responses via the redox system and dysregulate inhibitory and excitatory neural balance in various brain circuits, including the striatum. Thus, interventions that can induce antioxidant effects may counteract the neurodevelopmental impacts of THC exposure. METHODS: In the current study, we used an established preclinical adolescent rat model to examine the impacts of adolescent THC exposure on various behavioral, molecular, and neuronal biomarkers associated with increased mood and anxiety disorder vulnerability. Moreover, we investigated the protective properties of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine against THC-related pathology. RESULTS: We demonstrated that adolescent THC exposure induced long-lasting anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes concomitant with differential neuronal and molecular abnormalities in the two subregions of the nucleus accumbens, the shell and the core. In addition, we report for the first time that N-acetylcysteine can prevent THC-induced accumbal pathophysiology and associated behavioral abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The preventive effects of this antioxidant intervention highlight the critical role of redox mechanisms underlying cannabinoid-induced neurodevelopmental pathology and identify a potential intervention strategy for the prevention and/or reversal of these pathophysiological sequelae."

      "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a significant role in toxicity to the retina in a variety of diseases. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) and the dimeric di-N-acetylcysteine amide (diNACA) were evaluated in terms of protecting retinal cells, in vitro, in a variety of stress models. Three types of rat retinal cell cultures were utilized in the study: macroglial-only cell cultures, neuron-only retinal ganglion cell (RGC) cultures, and mixed cultures containing retinal glia and neurons. Ability of test agents to attenuate oxidative stress in all cultures was ascertained. In addition, capability of agents to protect against a variety of alternate clinically-relevant stressors, including excitotoxins and mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors, was also evaluated. Capacity of test agents to elevate cellular levels of reduced glutathione under normal and compromised conditions was also determined. NAC, NACA and diNACA demonstrated concentration-dependent cytoprotection against oxidative stress in all cultures. These three compounds, however, had differing effects against a variety of alternate insults to retinal cells. The most protective agent was NACA, which was most potent against the most stressors (including oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment by antimycin A and azide, and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity). Similar to NAC, NACA increased glutathione levels in non-injured cells, although diNACA did not, suggesting a different, unknown mechanism of antioxidant activity for the latter. In support of this, diNACA was the only agent to attenuate rotenone-induced toxicity in mitochondria. NAC, NACA and diNACA exhibited varying degrees of antioxidant activity, i.e., protected cultured rat retinal cells from a variety of stressors which were designed to mimic aspects of the pathology of different retinal diseases. A general rank order of activity was observed: NACA ≥ diNACA > NAC. These results warrant further exploration of NACA and diNACA as antioxidant therapeutics for the treatment of retinal diseases, particularly those involving oxidative stress. Furthermore, we have defined the battery of tests carried out as the \"Wood, Chidlow, Wall and Casson (WCWC) Retinal Antioxidant Indices\"; we believe that these are of great value for screening molecules for potential to reduce retinal oxidative stress in a range of retinal diseases.",

Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) nebulizer therapy in COPD patients. We evaluated the effect of nebulized NAC on the improvement of phlegm symptom in COPD patients. METHODS: This was a 12-week, prospective, single-arm, open-label, phase IV multi-center trial (NCT05102305, Registration Date: 20-October-2021). We enrolled patients aged ≥ 40 years with post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) < 0.7 and COPD assessment test (CAT) phlegm score ≥ 2; the patients were current or ex-smoker with smoking pack-years ≥ 10. The primary endpoint was to determine the change in CAT phlegm score at 12 weeks compared to the baseline. Patients were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment using the CAT score. RESULTS: In total, 100 COPD patients were enrolled from 10 hospitals. The mean age of the patients was 71.42 ± 8.20 years, with 19.78% being current-smokers and 80.22% being ex-smokers. The mean smoking pack-years was 40.32 ± 35.18. The mean FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC were 3.94 L (75.44%), 2.22 L (58.50%), and 0.53, respectively. The CAT phlegm score at baseline was 3.47 ± 1.06, whereas after 12 weeks of nebulized NAC it significantly decreased to 2.62 ± 1.30 (p < 0.01). More than half (53.5%) of the patients expressed satisfaction with the effects of nebulized NAC therapy. Adverse events occurred in 8 (8.0%) patients. Notably, no serious adverse drug reactions were reported. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have established the effectiveness and safety of nebulized NAC over 12 weeks.",

METHODS: A total of 98 children with pneumonia were assigned to the control group and observation group by random number table method. NAC was administered to the observation group and AH was given to the control group. The therapeutic effect was observed, the disappearance time of clinical symptoms and levels of inflammatory factors, lung function parameters, blood gas analysis parameters, and immunoglobulin were measured. The incidence of adverse reactions was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A higher effective rate was observed in the observation group than in the control group (p < 0.05). Antipyretic time, cough disappearance time, and lung rale disappearance time in the observation group were shorter than those in the control group (p < 0.05). After treatment, CRP and PCT were lower (p < 0.05), FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC were higher, PaCO2 was lower, PaO2 and SaO2 were higher, and IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 were higher in the observation group than those in the control group (p < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups was not significantly different (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: NAC combined with AH is effective in the treatment of pediatric pneumonia by effectively alleviating clinical symptoms, reducing inflammatory factors, and improving lung function and immune function.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol hangover (veisalgia) is a fairly common phenomenon. The pathogenesis of veisalgia is not understood and treatment has not yet been established. Occasionally, students take N-acetylcysteine (NAC) before binge drinking to alleviate hangover. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of NAC on serum levels of electrolytes, enzymes, oxidative stress biomarkers and symptoms of veisalgia in binge drinking. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy students were randomly assigned into two groups: one receiving NAC and the other receiving a placebo. Blood samples were taken before drinking, 30 min after a 1.5 h long drinking session, and the subsequent morning. Serum levels of electrolytes, urea, enzymes, ethanol, 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and N-epsilon-hexanoyl-lysine were measured. The participants completed the Acute Hangover Severity Scale (AHSS) assessment based on symptoms, and 40 students (20 male), aged 23 ± 2 years, were included in the study. Their mean blood ethanol concentration was 1.4 g/kg. Serum sodium levels were increased after drinking, and urea decreased the following morning compared to their levels before drinking in both groups. Serum 8-OHdG levels were increased after drinking and remained elevated until the following morning, compared to the levels before drinking, in both groups. NAC had no effect on sodium, urea and 8-OHdG levels or the symptoms of veisalgia. In conclusion, binge drinking causes a transient increase in serum sodium and as a prolonged increase in oxidative marker 8-OHdG levels. NAC had no effect on the sodium and 8-OHdG levels."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains a global health concern, and half of cured patients have permanent lung injury. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown beneficial antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects in preclinical tuberculosis models. We examined its effects on tuberculosis treatment outcomes. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial nested within the TB SEQUEL cohort study enrolled 140 adults with moderate or far-advanced tuberculosis. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to standard therapy with or without 1200 mg of oral NAC twice daily for days 1 to 112. Clinical evaluations, sputum culture, and spirometry were performed at specified intervals through day 168, after which participants returned to the TB SEQUEL cohort. The primary outcome was culture conversion. Secondary outcomes included whole-blood glutathione levels and lung function. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly young, male, and human immunodeficiency virus 1-negative and had heavy sputum Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection burdens. NAC increased glutathione levels (NAC × day interaction, 8.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93 to 15.02) but did not increase stable culture conversion (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.20; P=0.33). NAC treatment was associated with improved recovery of lung function (NAC × month, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.95] and 0.42 [95% CI, -0.06 to 0.91] for forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in the first second, respectively, as percentages of predicted values). The effects of NAC on lung function were greatest in participants with severe baseline lung impairment and appeared to persist beyond the period of NAC administration. Rates of serious or grade 3 to 4 nonserious adverse events did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing whole-blood glutathione levels, NAC did not affect eradication of MTB infection in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis that was moderate to far advanced. Secondary outcomes of lung function showed changes that merit further investigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used 16 male Wistar rats, which were divided into treatment and control groups. A standard axonotmesis-type surgical injury was induced in the left sciatic nerves of all rats. The treatment group was given 300 mg/kg of intraperitoneal NAC once a day, whereas the control group received an equal volume of saline solution. After conducting gait analyses, the sciatic functional index (SFI) was used for functional assessment. After gait analysis, all animals were euthanized. Blood samples were examined biochemically. The left sciatic nerves and left triceps surae muscles were examined histopathologically. RESULTS: Histopathologically, the thickness of the perineurium, axonal degeneration, axonolysis, edema, inflammation, muscle atrophy, and muscle degeneration were all significantly lower in the treatment group (p<0.05). Functionally, SFI-1, SFI-2, and SFI-3 were significantly higher in the treatment group (p<0.05). Biochemically, while the native thiol level and native thiol/total thiol ratio were significantly higher in the treatment group (p<0.003), the disulfide/total thiol ratio was significantly higher in the control group (p<0.005). Significant correlations were found between six of the seven gait parameters and the histopathological findings (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that NAC may contribute positively to the histopathological and functional recovery of sciatic nerve injury in rats. Furthermore, NAC may have an antioxidant effect on thiol-disulfide homeostasis at a biochemical level. We believe that NAC has a stimulatory effect on healing following nerve injuries.",

This study aimed to assess the impact of vitrification, utilizing a blend of cryoprotectant agents and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), on the cryopreservation of periodontal ligament tissues, and investigate the underlying mechanisms of NAC on the tooth cryopreservation. Periodontal ligament cells were isolated from freshly-extracted healthy human permanent teeth, and cell sheets of PDLCs were fabricated. The samples including cell sheets, freshly-extracted human and rat teeth were cryopreserved with or without NAC for three months. The viability, ROS level, gene expressions and microstructure of PDLCs within cell sheets were assessed. The expression of SOD-2, Caspase3, LC3A/B and Catalase were evaluated through western blotting. Histological assessments of cryopreserved cell sheets and teeth were conducted. PDLCs were isolated from cryopreserved teeth, and their immunophenotype and differentiation ability were evaluated. The data was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. The vitrification method showed good performance in preserving the viability and differentiation potential of PDLCs. Cryopreservation supplemented with NAC improved the survival rate of PDLCs, enhanced osteogenic differentiation ability, upregulated the expression of SOD-2 and Catalase, and inhibited cell apoptosis. Additionally, mRNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway following cryopreservation via vitrification. Adding a PI3K-AKT activator improved the survival rates of PDLCs post-cryopreservation. The vitrification strategy combining various CPAs and NAC proved to be feasible for tooth cryopreservation. Targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway may improve the efficacy of tooth cryopreservation.",

      "abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is known for its beneficial effects on health due to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties. This study explored the protective effects of NAC against oxidative stress in heat-stressed (HS) skeletal muscle cells and its role in promoting muscle development. NAC reduced the heat shock response by decreasing the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in HS-induced muscle cells during proliferation and differentiation. NAC also mitigated HS-induced oxidative stress via increasing the antioxidant enzyme levels and reducing oxidant enzyme levels. Treatment with NAC at 2 mM increased cell viability from 43.68% ± 5.14%-66.69% ± 14.43% and decreased the apoptosis rate from 7.89% ± 0.53%-5.17% ± 0.11% in skeletal muscle cells. Additionally, NAC promoted the proliferation and differentiation of HS-induced skeletal muscle cells by upregulating the expression of PAX7, MYF5, MRF4 and MYHC. These findings suggest that NAC alleviates HS-induced oxidative damage in skeletal muscle cells and support muscle development.",
