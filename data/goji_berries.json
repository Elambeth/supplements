      "abstract": "Alternaria alternata, as a main decay fungus of goji berry, can produce mycotoxins such as alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), and tenuazonic acid (TeA). Carvacrol (CVR) has exhibited a broad-spectrum antifungal activity in vitro. We assumed that CVR can also be applied to control Alternaria rot on goji berries and mycotoxins produced by the pathogens. To investigate whether CVR impacts the accumulation of mycotoxins and cell membrane damage of A. alternata, the antifungal activity of CVR on the fungal growth and mycotoxin production was evaluated in this study. The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CVR against A. alternata was 0.12 µL/mL. Meanwhile, the destruction of plasma membrane integrity, cytoplasmic leakage, intracellular oxidative damage, and inhibitory effect in vivo were also observed in A. alternata treated with CVR. Moreover, CVR significantly reduced the accumulation of AOH, AME, and TeA. Transcriptomic profiling was performed by means of comparative RNA-Seq analysis to research the gene expression level of A. alternata, which attested to significant changes in nitrogen metabolism, carbon utilization, fatty acid oxidation, and antioxidant enzymes in CVR-treated A. alternata. This study suggests a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of response to CVR treatment in A. alternata, indicating that CVR is a novel antifungal agent with the potential to be applied to various fungi."

      "abstract": "Natural plants contain numerous chemical compounds that are beneficial to human health. The berries from the Lycium genus are widely consumed and are highly nutritious. Moreover, their chemical constituents have attracted attention for their health-promoting properties. In East Asia, there are three varieties of the Lycium genus (Lycium barbarum L., Lycium chinense Miller, and L. ruthenicum Murray) that possess medicinal value and are commonly used for treating chronic diseases and improving metabolic disorders. These varieties are locally referred to as \"red Goji berries\" or \"black Goji berries\" due to their distinct colors, and they differ in their chemical compositions, primarily in terms of carotenoid and anthocyanin content. The pharmacological functions of these berries include anti-aging, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-exercise fatigue effects. This review aims to analyze previous and recent studies on the active ingredients and pharmacological activities of these Lycium varieties, elucidating their signaling pathways and assessing their impact on the gut microbiota. Furthermore, the potential prospects for using these active ingredients in the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated. This review explores the potential targets of these Lycium varieties in the treatment of relevant diseases, highlighting their potential value in drug development."

      "abstract": "Carbon dots (CDs) have been proposed as photosensitizers in photodynamic treatment (PDT), owing to their excellent biological attributes and budding fruit preservation applications. In the present study, CDs (4.66 nm) were synthesized for photodynamic treatment to improve the quality attributes in post-harvest goji berries. The prepared CDs extended the storage time of the post-harvest goji berries by 9 d. The CD-mediated PDT postponed the hardness and decay index loss, reduced the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide anion (O2•-) significantly, and delayed the loss of vital nutrients like the total protein, phenols, and flavonoids. The CD-mediated PDT improved the catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), glutathione reductase (GR), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, but did not improve polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity. In addition, The CD-mediated PDT induced the accumulation of ascorbic acid (ASA) and glutathione (GSH). Overall, a CD-mediated PDT could extend the storage time and augment the quality attributes in post-harvest fresh goji berries by regulating the antioxidant system."

      "abstract": "In the last decades, several nutraceutical substances have received great attention for their potential role in the prevention and treatment of different diseases as well as for their beneficial effects in promoting the health of humans and animals. Goji berries (GBs) are the fruit of Lycium barbarum and other species of Lycium, used in traditional Chinese medicine, and they have recently become very popular in the Occidental world because of their properties, such as anti-aging, antioxidant, anticancer, neuroprotective, cytoprotective, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities. These effects are essentially evaluated in clinical trials in humans; in experimental animal models, such as mice and rats; and in cell lines in in vitro studies. Only recently has scientific research evaluated the effects of GBs diet supplementation in livestock animals, including rabbits. Although studies in the zootechnical field are still limited and the investigation of the GB mechanisms of action is in an early stage, the results are encouraging. This review includes a survey of the experimental trials that evaluated the effects of the GBs supplementation on reproductive and productive performances, immune system, metabolic homeostasis, and meat quality principally in the rabbit with also some references to other livestock animal species. Evidence supports the idea that GB supplementation could be used in rabbit breeding, although future studies should be conducted to establish the optimal dose to be administered and to assess the sustainability of the use of GBs in the diet of the rabbit."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Goji berries (GB), usually marketed as a 'superfruit', are a widely used herbal supplement. As with other herbal remedies, the use of GB might be associated with herb-drug interactions, increasing plasma levels of other drugs and causing adverse events. Here, we present the case of a patient that developed flecainide toxicity secondary to an herb-drug interaction, associated with the use of GB to prevent COVID-19. CASE SUMMARY: A 75-year-old female presented to the emergency department with fainting. She was taking flecainide for the treatment of atrial extrasystoles diagnosed 2 years previously, and she was using a tea of GB for the prevention of COVID-19. The admission electrocardiogram showed a wide complex polymorphic tachycardia that was considered and treated as flecainide toxicity. The patient had a favourable evolution and was discharged 48 h after admission. DISCUSSION: Flecainide toxicity is uncommon and needs timely recognition and treatment; it is usually secondary to overdose and renal or hepatic failure. In our case, toxicity was associated with GB use, probably by inhibition of CYP2D6 which is the main enzyme associated with the metabolism of flecainide. Clinicians need to be aware of the possible interactions between herbal remedies (in this case used for the prevention of COVID-19) and cardiovascular drugs that are used to treat chronic cardiovascular diseases."

      "abstract": "Lycium fruits have a high content of phenolics as bioactive constituents with various pharmacological effects, but there is a lack of comparative analysis and chemical profiling of phenolics in Lycium fruit varieties. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE) combined with chemometrics was developed to characterize the phenolics in fruits from four Lycium species, including Lycium barbarum L. (LBL), L. chinense Mill. (LCM), L. barbarum var. auranticarpum (LBA) and L. ruthenicun Murr. (LRM). 63 phenolics were identified according to reported tandem mass fragmentation patterns and the UNIFI scientific informatics platform. Nine phenolics (5, 18, 20, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 60) were common and predominant components among four types of Lycium fruit. The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were analyzed on the basis of a matrix created from 653 sets of data, and 20 Lycium fruits were classified into four groups. Further analysis identified that phenolics profiles were characteristic for each Lycium species, and five markers (13, 29, 31, 35, 99) could be utilized for fruit identification. Subsequently, inhibitory activity against 5α-reductase of phenolic extracts of Lycium fruits showed that LBL extract was the relative better effective, followed by LCM, whereas LBA and LRM showed no activity, which might be associated with the high contents of marker compounds (29, 31, 35, 43, 71, 99) in LBL. These findings will provide guidance for the development of Lycium phenolics with beneficial properties for the prevention and treatment of Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).",

The aim of this study was to investigate the storability of fresh goji berries treated with high CO2 and low O2 concentrations before air storage at 1 °C for 21 days. RESULTS: Berries harvested without stems were exposed to air (controls) or subjected for 2 days at 1 °C to the following controlled atmosphere (CA) treatments: 21% O2 + 0% CO2 (21+0), 5% O2 + 15% CO2 (5+15), 10% O2 + 10% CO2 (10+10) and 20% O2 + 20% CO2 (20+20). During 14 days of storage, all treatments decreased weight loss, while treatments 5+15 and 20+20 prevented fungal decay. No fermentation was observed. The treatments did not affect color changes, decreases in soluble sugars and increases in total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, total carotenoids, total phenolics and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) during storage, apart from the marginally reduced FRAP by treatment 20+20 on day 7. Treatments 5+15, 10+10 and 20+20 resulted in residual decreases in respiration rates and pH values early during storage. After 14 days of storage, panelists rated the CA-treated samples as sweet, with good acceptance. CONCLUSION: Treatments 5+15 and 20+20 showed the best results after 14 days of storage. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Goji berries (Lycium Barbarum, L.) are known for their nutritional potential as a great source of trace metals (e.g., copper, zinc and manganese) which are present in the form of highly bioaccessible compounds. In order to assess the bioaccessibility of trace elements and to identify compounds responsible for better bioaccessibility of copper and zinc, an in vitro simulation of gastrointestinal digestion was used in this study. The total content of trace metals was evaluated using sample digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Bioaccessibility of trace elements was estimated by size exclusion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These analytical methods were used to analyse samples of goji berries to determine the highest amount of elements. For total trace metal content in goji berries, Zn had the highest level of the three studied (10.6μgg-1), while the total content of manganese and copper was 9.9μgg-1 and 6.1μgg-1, respectively. Additionally, the analysed metals were found to be highly bioaccessible to the human body (about 56% for Mn, 72% for Cu and 64% for Zn in the gastric extract and approximately 35% for Mn, 23% for Cu and 31% for Zn in the case of gastrointestinal extract). To obtain information about metal complexes present in goji berries, extraction treatment using different solutions (ionic liquid, HEPES, SDS, Tris-HCl, ammonium acetate, water) was performed. Enzymatic treatment using pectinase and hemicellulase was also checked. Extracts of berries were analysed by SEC-ICP-MS and μHPLC-ESI-MS/MS techniques. The ionic liquid and pectinase extraction helped efficiently extract copper (seven compounds) and zinc (four compounds) complexes. Compounds identified in goji berries are most likely to be responsible for better bioaccessibility of those elements to the human organism.",

The free-run and the pressed juice of dried and fresh goji berries were used for wine production, whereas glycosidase was applied to wine after fermentation. Dried goji berry fermented wine exhibited much stronger fruity, floral, caramel, and herbaceous odors due to higher levels of esters, β-ionone and methionol. However, fresh berry fermented wine possessed stronger chemical notes due to higher levels of 4-ethylphenol. Pressing treatment reduced the fruity and caramel odors in these fermented wines, and fresh berry free-run juice fermented wine exhibited the least floral aroma. Glycosidase addition did not alter the aromatic composition of wines. The principal component analysis indicated that goji raw material played a primary role in differentiating the aromatic profiles of the wines due to the difference on the content of 20 esters, nine benzenes, eight aldehydes/ketones, three acids, two alcohols and six other volatiles. The content differences on isopentyl alcohol, styrene, benzyl alcohol, 1-octanol, (E)-5-decen-1-ol, 1-hexanol, and β-cyclocitral resulted in the segregation of the wines with and without the pressing treatment, especially for fresh berry fermented wine.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The effects of the addition of cyclodextrins (CDs), β-CD, or HP-β-CD (1%), on the protection of antioxidant compounds of mandarin juices enriched with pomegranate extract and goji berries juice, was studied. Juices were prepared and after their thermal treatment (98 °C, 30 s) they were stored at 4 °C during 75 d. Vitamin C content, CIE L*a*b* color, antioxidant capacity, retinol equivalents, and sensory properties were studied. Losses on vitamin C were higher (6%) for juices with β-CD than juices with HP-β-CD. Retinol equivalents degradation was lower (3.4%) in juices with HP-β-cyclodextrins than in those treated with β-CD. Lower losses were observed for the instrumental and sensory color intensity in juices with HP-β-CD addition. Finally, the antioxidant capacity was also higher in juices treated with HP-β-CD. Finally, the overall sensory quality of juices with HP-β-CD was the best one after 30 d of cold storage. Even though β-CD addition did not cause any improvement compared with control juice (without CD addition), the benefits of adding HP-β-CD to this particular juice were shown in almost all parameters under study. PRACTICAL APPLICATION:  The present study deals with the practical aspects of the utilization of CDs and CD-complexes in the food industry. The molecular encapsulation of lipophilic food ingredients with CD are supposed to improve the stability of flavors, vitamins, colorants, and antioxidant activity, leading to extended product shelf life. The HP-β-CD treated mandarin juice enriched with pomegranate extract and juice of goji berries will have a more intense color, higher vitamin C content, retinol equivalents, and antioxidant activity during storage and shelf life than control juices, with no CD addition.",
