      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional physiotherapy plays a significant role in treating distal radius fractures (DRF), but pain and functional limitations can persist despite treatment. Therefore, additional interventions are needed to improve treatment efficacy. Motor imagery (MI) has been shown to improve pain, function, range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength in musculoskeletal rehabilitation, though studies on its effect on upper extremity injuries are limited. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of MI training applied with the telerehabilitation method on pain, kinesiophobia, and functionality in patients with DRF. STUDY DESIGN: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial with registration number NCT05360836. METHODS: Thirty volunteer patients aged 18-65 years with DRF, who decided to be treated conservatively, were randomly allocated to either the conventional treatment (CT) group (n = 15; 40.28 ± 18.18 years) or the MI group (n = 15; 38.80 ± 14.12 years). The MI group received imagery treatment in addition to traditional rehabilitation, and the CT group received traditional rehabilitation (three times a week for 8 weeks). Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand was our primary outcome measure, while the secondary outcome measures included the Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation, Visual Analog Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, normal ROM in the wrist joint, grip strength of hand and finger, left-right discrimination, and quality of life. RESULTS: The pain intensity, wrist functional status, muscle strength, active ROM, and quality of life were improved in both groups. Group comparisons showed statistically significant changes in Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation-function parameter, wrist extension active ROM, and hand grip strength in favor of the MI group (respectively, Δmean = -13.15, p = 0.034, effect size [ES] = 0.76, Δmean = -9.33, p = 0.019, ES = 0.91, Δmean = -10.96, p = 0.008, ES = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Adding MI to conservative treatment after DRF improved function, wrist extension, and hand grip strength compared to CT alone."

      "abstract": "Action perception, execution, and imagery share motor-cognitive processes. Given prevalent sensory and motor coordination difficulties in autism, the processes of action perception and imagery may also be altered. This study investigated whether autistic adults can engage in motor imagery by testing potential differences in executing, perceiving, and imagining hand movements between autistic and non-autistic adults. Twenty autistic individuals and twenty age- and IQ-matched controls completed execution, imagination, and perception tasks using a Fitts' Law paradigm in an online session. For the execution and imagination tasks, participants performed or imagined making aiming movements between two targets. For the action perception task, participants indicated whether they could perform as accurately as the movements in presented videos. Target size and distance were manipulated into three difficulty levels and systematically varied across all tasks. Results showed Fitts' Law relationships for all tasks for both groups, with significant positive correlations between movement times and difficulty level. Movement times were longest in the imagination task and shortest in the perception task for both groups. These findings suggest motor imagery processes are relatively intact in autistic adults, highlighting that further investigation of motor imagery as a therapy for motor coordination difficulties in autistic individuals is warranted.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Motor imagery (MI) practice has shown substantial benefits on force, but this was mostly demonstrated on force produced by isometric contractions in laboratory settings. Here, we tested a new type of MI intervention to improve force and power in expert athletes. DESIGN: CrossFit® athletes (n = 100) of national level were randomly assigned to experimental groups who completed a 5-week back squat training program (3 resistance training sessions/week, ~1 h per week). A first group (n = 35) received instructions to perform kinesthetic MI of the concentric phase of the back squat concomitant to its physical execution (MICONCENTRIC). A second group (n = 35) performed kinesthetic MI of the eccentric phase concomitant to its physical execution (MECCENTRIC). A control group (n = 30) completed the same amount of physical training without engaging in MI (Control). METHODS: Performance was indexed from the 5 repetition maximum (5 RM) squat workload before and after the intervention. Weekly, we assessed squat power using an accelerometer. RESULTS: MICONCENTRIC and MIECCENTRIC groups outperformed Control regarding pretest vs. posttest improvements in both 5 RM force and power (RP2 = 0.60, both p < 0.001). The MIECCENTRIC group also outperformed the MICONCENTRIC group for the 5 RM workload (RP2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). However, subjective evaluations revealed that athletes in the MIECCENTRIC group experienced higher effort perception and difficulty to complete the experimental task. CONCLUSIONS: MI practice concomitant to physical training was efficient to improve force on a dynamic multi-joint exercise in expert athletes."

      "abstract": "This study investigates whether the combined effect of kinesthetic motor imagery-based brain computer interface (KI-BCI) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on upper limb function in subacute stroke patients is more effective than using KI-BCI or tDCS alone. Forty-eight subacute stroke survivors were randomized to the KI-BCI, tDCS, or BCI-tDCS group. The KI-BCI group performed 30 min of KI-BCI training. Patients in tDCS group received 30 min of tDCS. Patients in BCI-tDCS group received 15 min of tDCS and 15 min of KI-BCI. The treatment cycle was five times a week, for four weeks. After all intervention, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity, Motor Status Scale, and the Modified Barthel Index scores of the KI-BCI group were superior to those of the tDCS group. The BCI-tDCS group was superior to the tDCS group in terms of the Motor Status Scale. Although quantitative EEG showed no significant group differences, the quantitative EEG indices in the tDCS group were significantly lower than before treatment. In conclusion, after treatment, although all intervention strategies improved upper limb motor function and daily living abilities in subacute stroke patients, KI-BCI demonstrated significantly better efficacy than tDCS. Under the same total treatment duration, the combined use of tDCS and KI-BCI did not achieve the hypothesized optimal outcome. Notably, tDCS reduced QEEG indices, possibly indicating favorable future outcomes in future.Trial registry number: ChiCTR2000034730.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that impacts motor planning and control of the upper limbs (UL) and leads to cognitive impairments. Rehabilitation approaches, including motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO), along with the use of brain-machine interfaces (BMI), are essential in the PD population to enhance neuroplasticity and mitigate symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To provide a description of a rehabilitation protocol for evaluating the effects of isolated and combined applications of MI and action observation (AO), along with BMI, on upper limb (UL) motor changes and cognitive function in PD. METHODS: This study provides a detailed protocol for a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. After selection, participants will be randomly assigned to one of five experimental groups. Each participant will be assessed at three points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at a follow-up four weeks after the intervention ends. The intervention consists of 10 sessions, each lasting approximately 60 minutes. EXPECTED RESULTS: The primary outcome expected is an improvement in the Test d'Évaluation des Membres Supérieurs de Personnes Âgées score, accompanied by a reduction in task execution time. Secondary outcomes include motor symptoms in the upper limbs, assessed via the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - Part III and the 9-Hole Peg Test; cognitive function, assessed with the PD Cognitive Rating Scale; and occupational performance, assessed with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. DISCUSSION: This study protocol is notable for its intensive daily sessions. Both MI and AO are low-cost, enabling personalized interventions that physiotherapists and occupational therapists can readily replicate in practice. While BMI use does require professionals to acquire an exoskeleton, the protocol ensures the distinctiveness of the interventions and, to our knowledge, is the first to involve individuals with PD.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Impaired balance leads to loss of function, e.g., the inability to walk safely. Therefore, restoring balance is a common goal of rehabilitation after a stroke. An innovative motor imaging and robotic device, the Erigo®Pro walking table, was used to improve balance in patients who had suffered an acute stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six stroke patients in the acute phase with an average age of 64.85 ± 18.62 years were randomly assigned to one of three groups (22 subjects each) and treated with different therapies (conventional, conventional with Erigo®Pro, and conventional with Erigo®Pro enriched with motor imaging). The duration of therapy was two weeks. Patients were assessed before and after completion of therapy. The study used the trunk stability test and the Berg Balance Scale to assess balance, and the Riablo™ device to measure static balance. In addition, an assessment of the superficial tension of the transversus abdominis and multifidus muscles was performed. The clinical trial registration URL unique identifier was NCT06276075. RESULTS: In each of the groups studied, the therapies applied resulted in significant improvement in functional assessment of trunk stability and balance (TCT < 0.001 and BBS < 0.001). The assessment of balance in the frontal (p = 0.023) and sagittal (p = 0.074) planes with the Riablo™ device confirmed the superiority of motor imaging-enhanced therapy at the level of a statistical trend. The tension of the transversus abdominis was higher at the second measurement (M = 14.41; SE = 3.31). CONCLUSIONS: Motor imagery-enhanced therapy is most important, both for trunk stability and functional improvement of body balance parameters and for increasing transversus abdominis muscle tension."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Guided imagery techniques, which include mentally picturing motions or activities to help motor recovery, are an important part of neuroplasticity-based motor therapy in stroke patients. Motor imagery (MI) is a kind of guided imagery in neurorehabilitation that focuses on mentally rehearsing certain motor actions in order to improve performance. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current evidence on guided imagery techniques and identify their therapeutic potential in stroke motor rehabilitation. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the English language were identified from an online search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, EBSCOhost, and Scopus databases without a specific search time frame. The inclusion criteria take into account guided imagery interventions and evaluate their impact on motor recovery through validated clinical, neurophysiological, or functional assessments. This review has been registered on Open OSF with the following number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/3D7MF. Results: This review synthesized 41 RCTs on MI in stroke rehabilitation, with 996 participants in the intervention group and 757 in the control group (average age 50-70, 35% female). MI showed advantages for gait, balance, and upper limb function; however, the RoB 2 evaluation revealed 'some concerns' related to allocation concealment, blinding, and selective reporting issues. Integrating MI with gait training or action observation (AO) seems to improve motor recovery, especially in balance and walking. Technological methods like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and hybrid models that combine MI with circuit training hold potential for enhancing functional mobility and motor results. Conclusions: Guided imagery shows promise as a beneficial adjunct in stroke rehabilitation, with the potential to improve motor recovery across several domains such as gait, upper limb function, and balance."

      "abstract": "Neurofeedback (NF), an advanced technique enabling self-regulation of brain activity, was used to enhance upper limb motor recovery in chronic stroke survivors. A comparison was conducted between the efficacy of NF versus motor imagery (MI) training without feedback. We hypothesized that employing a bimodal EEG-fMRI based NF training approach would ensure precise targeting, and incorporating progressive multi-target feedback would provide a more effective mean to enhance plasticity. Thirty stroke survivors, exhibiting partial upper-limb motor impairment with a Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity score (FMA-UE) > 21 and partially functional corticospinal tract (CST) were randomly allocated to the NF and MI groups. The NF group (n = 15) underwent a bimodal EEG-fMRI NF training focused on regulating activity in ipsilesional motor areas (M1 and SMA), while the MI group (n = 15) engaged in MI training. Demographic and stroke clinical data were collected. The primary outcome measure was the post-intervention FMA-UE score. Change in bold activations in target regions, EEG and fMRI laterality index (LI) and fractional anisotropy (FA) asymmetry of the CST were assessed after the intervention in both groups (respectively ΔEEG LI, ΔMRI LI and ΔFA asymmetry) and correlated with FMA-UE improvement (ΔFMA). Participants from both groups completed the 5-week training, with the NF group successfully modulating their brain activity in target regions. FMA-UE improvement post-intervention tended to be higher in the NF group than in the MI group (p = 0.048), and FMA-UE increased significantly only in the NF group (p = 0.003 vs p = 0.633 for MI). This improvement persisted at one-month in the NF group (p = 0.029). Eight out 15 patients in the NF group positively responded (i.e., improved by at least for 4 points in FMA-UE) compared to 3 out 15 in the MI group. No significant between-group differences were found in the evolution of ipsilesional M1 (t = 1.43, p = 0.16) and SMA (t = 0.85, p = 0.40) activation maps. The NF group exhibited a more pronounced lateralisation in unimodal EEG LI (t = - 3.56, p = 0.0004) compared to the MI group, but no significant difference was observed for MRI LI. A non-significant difference in ΔFA asymmetry of the CST between the two groups was found (t = 25; p = 0,055). A non-significant correlation between unimodal ΔEEG LI and ΔFMA (r = 0.5; p = 0.058) was observed for the NF group. Chronic stroke survivors can effectively engage themselves in a NF task and can benefit from a bimodal EEG-fMRI NF training. This demonstrates potential for NF in enhancing upper-limb motor recovery more efficiently than MI training.",

We investigated if mental practice techniques (AO vs. combined AO+MI) can improve entry-level healthcare students' ability to locate anatomical structures in the immediate and short-term. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within a randomised control trial design, participants received a traditional anatomy lecture (Control, n = 13), or lecture plus AO (n = 13), or lecture plus combined AO+MI (n = 12). Mental practice involved either watching a physiotherapist's demonstration of (AO), or watching and imagining the feeling of (AO+MI) locating upper-limb anatomical points on a human model. Post intervention, participants located these points on a human model, assessed by diagnostic ultrasound, immediately and at one-week follow-up. RESULTS: Immediately post, accuracy was greater for AO+MI (M = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6-2.4) and AO (M = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.7-2.6), than Control (M = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.0-1.8; ps < 0.05). At the follow-up, AO+MI (M = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.8-2.7) was significantly more accurate than AO (M = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.8-1.8; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: While mental practice groups out-performed the Control immediately post, only the AO+MI group retained this advantage. Educators should therefore consider augmenting traditional anatomy lectures with mental practice as a low-cost resource for enhancing learning."

      "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in engaging the motor cortex for recovery. However, individual responses to MI-based BCIs are highly variable and relatively weak. Conversely, combined action observation (AO) and motor imagery (MI) paradigms have demonstrated stronger responses compared to AO or MI alone, along with enhanced cortical excitability. In this study, a novel BCI called Combined AO, MI, and Steady-State Motion Visual Evoked Potential (SSMVEP) (CAMS) was proposed. CAMS was designed based on gait observation and imagination. Twenty-five healthy volunteers participated in the study with CAMS serving as the intervention and SSMVEP checkerboard as the control condition. We hypothesized the CAMS intervention can induce observable increases in the negativity of the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) associated with ankle dorsiflexion. MRCP components, including Bereitschaftspotential, were measured pre- and post-intervention. Additionally, the signal characteristics of the visual and motor responses were quantified. Finally, a two-class visual BCI classification performance was assessed. A consistent increase in negativity was observed across all MRCP components in signals over the primary motor cortex, compared to the control condition. CAMS visual BCI achieved a median accuracy of 83.8%. These findings demonstrate the ability of CAMS BCI to enhance cortical excitability in relation to movement preparation and execution. The CAMS stimulus not only evokes SSMVEP-like activity and sensorimotor rhythm but also enhances the MRCP. These findings contribute to the understanding of CAMS paradigm in enhancing cortical excitability, consistent and reliable classification performance holding promise for motor rehabilitation outcomes and future BCI design considerations.",

However, due to the inadequacies of longitudinal studies and multimodal assessment methods, the rehabilitation mechanisms of methods such as Acupuncture Treatment (AT) and Motor Imagery (MI) remain unclear. Consequently, this study presents both AT and Acupuncture Synchronized with MI (ASMI) therapies, utilizing a combination of subjective and objective approaches to evaluate the long-term impacts of these two treatment modalities. METHODS: A longitudinal design was adopted for a duration of two weeks. Clinical improvement in patients was assessed using scale data, while Functional Near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected to analyze changes in brain function. This study proposed the Cluster-Span Threshold for Directed Networks (CSTDN) algorithm for identifying key connections within the brain network and conducted in-depth analysis using graph theory metrics. RESULTS: Scale data indicated improvements in behavioral capabilities in both groups post-treatment. EEG and fNIRS data revealed significant variations in specific frequency bands between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study not only validates the efficacy of AT and ASMI in stroke rehabilitation but also unveils the underlying neurobiological mechanisms through multimodal data analysis. The proposed CSTDN algorithm and graph theory analysis offer new perspectives for understanding changes in the brain network. SIGNIFICANCE: This research contributes to the optimization of future rehabilitation treatment strategies and the formulation of personalized treatment plans."

      "abstract": "Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) have significant potential for neurorehabilitation and motor recovery. However, most BCI systems employ multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording devices, during which the pre-experimental preparation and post-experimental hair cleaning are time-consuming and inconvenient for stroke patients, and potentially affect their motivation for rehabilitation training. In this paper, we introduced a wearable MI-BCI system for online MI classification using a wireless headband device with four EEG channels to reduce setup time while enhancing portability. To validate the performance of the system in decoding MI-EEG signals, extensive experiments and comparisons were performed on sixty-six healthy subjects. Specifically, an offline and an online experiment with forty-six subjects were conducted, with the system achieving average offline and online accuracies of 85.21% and 76.54%, respectively. Furthermore, a comparison experiment involving another twenty subjects showed that the online performance of our headband device (77.84%) was comparable to that of a mature commercial Neuroscan device (76.50%). Compared to several existing portable systems, our wearable system achieved superior performance with fewer channels and was validated on a larger number of subjects. These results demonstrated that our wearable BCI system can reduce preparation time, enhance portability, and meet the classification performance requirements for BCI-based rehabilitation intervention, indicating its substantial potential for large-scale clinical applications in enhancing motor recovery of stroke patients."

We examined the feasibility and impact of MP of VC and EMST on pulmonary and cough function in twenty community-dwelling adults. Participants underwent two baseline research evaluations of maximum expiratory and inspiratory pressure (MEP, MIP), forced vital capacity (FVC), voluntary peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), and cough spirometry. After the second research evaluation, participants underwent five weeks of MP of VC or EMST (alternating assignment, 25 repetitions, 70% training load, daily) at home with weekly telehealth sessions. Participants underwent post-treatment research evaluations of MEP, MIP, FVC, PEF, cough spirometry, and the Exercise Therapy Burden Questionnaire (ETBQ). Treatment adherence and telehealth attendance were tracked. Descriptives and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed. MP adherence was 95% and telehealth attendance was 91%. Median (IQR) ETBQ scores were 8 (1, 15), indicating minimal burden. Across both MP groups, increases in PEF from a handheld device (+ 13.7, 95% CI: 1.8, 25.6, p = 0.03) and from cough spirometry (+ 0.71, 95% CI: 0.05, 1.4, p = 0.04) were observed. Increases in PEF from cough spirometry (+ 1.00, 95% CI: 0.12, 1.9, p = 0.04) were observed for the MP VC group. Preliminary data demonstrate MP of VC and EMST is feasible and improves voluntary cough in community-dwelling adults. Future research is needed in larger sample sizes and patient populations with pulmonary, cough, and swallowing impairments."

Few studies have focused on the effects of BCI-VR on attention, executive function, and lower-limb function in stroke. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate feasibility and preliminary efficacy of BCI-VR pedaling training on the attention, executive function, and lower-extremity function in people after stroke. It will also provide data support for future research, especially sample size calculations. DESIGN: A single group before-after trial design was used. All participants had a stable level of function over a 2-week period to ensure that their functional recovery was all attributable to BCI-VR training. SETTING: The study was conducted in a specialized rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve participants with stroke, a certain level of motor imagery ability, capable of walking 10 meters continuously. INTERVENTIONS: All participants received a 4-week BCI-VR pedaling training program, 5 days per week, 30 minutes each session. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes are feasibility and safety. Secondary outcomes were lower-extremity mobility, attention, and executive functions. RESULTS: Twelve patients were recruited from inpatient rehabilitation and nine completed the study (six males/three females; 56.6 ± 11.6 years). Recruitment and retention rates were 34% and 75%, respectively. Excellent adherence rate (97.7%) was obtained. No adverse events or equipment issues were reported. Following the intervention, significant improvements were found in the lower-extremity strength, balance, walking stability, attention, and general cognitive function (p < .05). A significant correlation was found between improved Berg balance scale change values and symbol digit modalities test change values (p < .05, r = 0.677). CONCLUSIONS: BCI-VR pedaling training provides a depth of feasibility and safety data, methodological detail, and preliminary results. This could provide a useful basis for future studies of BCI-VR pedaling training for stroke rehabilitation. CLINICALTRIALS: gov registration number: ChiCTR2300071522 (http://www.chictr.org.cn)."

Upper limb motor dysfunction is a common manifestation of neurological dysfunction after stroke and can exert significant effects on a patient's daily living ability and quality-of-life. Therefore, it is crucial to provide appropriate rehabilitation treatment for upper limb motor function in stroke patients with hemiplegia. Currently, rehabilitation treatment for upper limb motor function in hemiplegic stroke patients in China includes motor therapy, neuro-promoting technology, occupational therapy, physical factor intervention, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy. Motor imagery therapy has also been shown to effectively promote the rehabilitation of upper limb function in stroke patients. Here, we review the concept, classification, mechanism of action, application, and effect of motor imagery therapy for the rehabilitation of upper limb motor function in stroke patients with hemiplegia in China. We summarize the available evidence, arising from Chinese experience, to support the implementation of this method in medical and rehabilitation institutions."

      "abstract": "Purpose: This study evaluates the response to a motor imagery intervention using visual or auditory inputs in patients with persistent pelvic pain. A secondary objective is to assess how patients' mental visualization capacity influences intervention outcomes. Methods: Forty patients diagnosed with persistent pelvic pain were enrolled in a randomized trial with six motor imagery sessions over 2 weeks. Patients were assigned to interventions delivered through images or audio recordings. Pain intensity, attention to pain, and the ability to mentally visualize and perceive movements were assessed. Results: Participants receiving auditory stimulus-based interventions showed a nonsignificant reduction in pain intensity (from 7.1 points [SD: 1.9] to 6.1 points [SD: 2.4]; p=0.091), while those in the visual input group experienced no change. Attention to pain improved in the visual group (from 30.2 points [SD: 6.2] to 27.6 points [SD: 6.8]; p=0.194), whereas it remained stable in the auditory group. Importantly, the participants' ability to mentally visualize and perceive movements did not significantly impact the outcomes. Conclusions: Auditory motor imagery appears to be a promising, less intrusive approach for managing persistent pelvic pain, with home-based interventions showing potential where access to conventional care is limited. This study highlights the importance of personalized motor imagery approaches, demonstrating superior efficacy for auditory interventions compared to visual ones. Limitations include a brief intervention period and recruitment challenges, yet motor imagery remains a viable therapeutic option. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06343649.",

However, their applicability to all pain mechanisms is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare the TPDT, LRJT, motor imagery ability, and PPT of chronic rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (C-RCRSP) patients with asymptomatic and pain-free controls. METHODS: Forty-eight C-RCRSP patients and 45 pain-free controls were assessed using a caliper for TPDT and the Recognize® application for LRJT. Motor ability, PPT, physical function, fear avoidance, pain catastrophizing, and Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) were also evaluated. As part of the subgroup analysis, C-RCRSP patients were divided into two groups based on their CSI (≥40, n = 19; <40, n = 29). RESULTS: C-RCRSP patients demonstrated higher TPDT thresholds [acromion (F = 5.41, p = 0.001) and deltoid (F = 26.67, p < 0.001)] but no significant differences in LRJT performance [recognition accuracy (F = 2.47, p = 0.063) and response time (F = 0.98, p = 0.414)] than pain-free controls in both shoulder joints. C-RCRSP patients had poorer motor imagery abilities (p < 0.001). The deltoid region PPT differed significantly between the groups (F = 17.45, p < 0.001), but it was not significant for the tibialis anterior region (F = 1.16, p = 0.33). C-RCRSP patients with a CSI≥40 reported higher night pain, reduced shoulder range of motion, slower response times, poorer motor imagery ability, and higher scores on pain-related questionnaires compared to those with a CSI<40 (p = 0.043-<0.001). CONCLUSION: C-RCRSP patients demonstrated poorer tactile acuity, mechanical sensitivity, and motor imagery ability especially in those with central sensitization, which should be considered in treatment planning.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: According to people with Parkinson's disease (PD), gait impairments are the most disabling motor symptoms of PD. Recently, motor imagery (MI) has gained notoriety as a gait training technique due to the flexibility of its use, however, it has not been demonstrated that causes a superior effect when included in physiotherapy. This study aims to determine if gait training combined with MI has a greater effect on the gait of people with PD than just gait training. METHODS: The GAITimagery is designed as a double-blind, randomized control trial, including a convenience sample in 2 parallel groups (1:1) with two interventions of 2 sessions per week during 6-week and 8-week follow-up. The initial recruitment will be 88 participants with idiopathic PD and unimpaired cognition state, who will be randomly divided into two groups: GAITimagery (GiG) or the active control Gait group (GaG). Both will perform the same gait exercises but only GiG will include MI training. Gait speed is the primary outcome, while Maximum gait speed (m/s) and Gait speed variability are the secondary results. The tertiary outcomes are related to Quality of life, Daily life activities, Freezing of gait, Balance, Mobility, and Gait performance measures to psychometrics and biomechanics instruments. All results will be measured at baseline (t0), post-training (t1), and follow-up assessment (t2) 8 weeks after finished physiotherapy programs. DISCUSSION: The GAITimagery program standardizes the application of MI exercises related to the improvement of parkinsonian gait at the same time that monitoring the vividness referred by the participants session by session. The effectiveness of this MI-exclusive program includes subjective and objective measurement tools to detect minimal changes after training. This still-to-be-finish study will support the therapeutic decisions on whether or not to allocate session time to imagery exercises depending on the effect size achieved and the comparison with a control gait training."

METHODS: A total of 117 women between the ages of 18-40 were included in the study. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the menstrual pain intensity, the Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) for the menstrual-related symptoms, and the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire-20 (KVIQ-20) for the motor imagery were used. All measurements were conducted on the first or second day of the menstruation, depending on when the subject declared subjectively experiencing most symptoms. RESULTS: The relationship between menstruation symptoms and visual imagery (VI) and kinesthetic imagery (KI) skills was examined. A weak negative correlation was found between MSQ_negative effects/somatic complaints and KVIQ-20_KI (p = .040, r = -.199). The relationship between menstrual pain intensity and KVIQ-20 items was examined. The strongest relationship was found between VAS and KVIQ-20_knee_VI and KVIQ-20_hip_VI (p = 003, r = -.288; p = 005, r = -.270; p = 004, respectively). A weak negative correlation was also found between VAS and KVIQ-20_VI_total and KVIQ-20_KI_total (p = 0.004, r = -.275; p = 0.19, r = -.227, respectively). DISCUSSION: This is the first study to examine menstrual symptoms in women in detail and reveal their relationship with motor imagery skills. Menstrual symptoms, especially negative effects/somatic complaints seen during menstruation, negatively affect kinesthetic imagery ability. In addition; chronic menstrual pain has a negative effect on both kinesthetic and visual imagery abilities. Considering the impairments in motor imagery skills due to negative effects/somatic complaints during menstruation and chronic menstrual pain, adding motor imagery training to treatment programs aimed at improving women's health may have positive effects."

However, the need for long-term intervention can represent a significant burden on patients. Here, we demonstrate that motor imagery (MI) instructions for BMI training, when supplemented with somatosensory stimulation in addition to conventional verbal instructions, can help enhance MI capabilities of healthy participants. METHODS: Sixteen participants performed MI during scalp EEG signal acquisition before and after somatosensory stimulation to assess MI-induced cortical excitability, as measured using the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). The non-dominant left hand was subjected to neuromuscular electrical stimulation above the sensory threshold but below the motor threshold (St-NMES), along with passive movement stimulation using an exoskeleton. Participants were randomly divided into an intervention group, which received somatosensory stimulation, and a control group, which remained at rest without stimulation. RESULTS: The intervention group exhibited a significant increase in SMR-ERD compared to the control group, indicating that somatosensory stimulation contributed to improving MI ability. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that somatosensory stimulation, combining electrical and mechanical stimuli, can improve MI capability and enhance the excitability of the sensorimotor cortex in healthy individuals.",

The research involved a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial with three groups: MIActive, MISham, and Control. Participants engaged in a cognitively demanding obstacle course, with time and prefrontal activation (ΔO2Hb and ΔHHb) measured across three-time points (Baseline, Post-test, 1-week follow-up). Following a pretest, active or sham tDCS was administered during an MI session, while the Control group did not receive this intervention. The MIActive group showed significant improvements in time-to-completion immediately after the intervention and one week later. Additionally, ΔO2Hb levels were lower in the MIActive group than in the other groups. These findings suggest that the combination of MI and tDCS could lead to motor improvements. The study outcomes support the feasibility and initial effectiveness of using MI and tDCS as a non-motor intervention to enhance motor outcomes in short and medium terms. Further research is recommended to explore the impact of this intervention in individuals with existing motor impairments. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the potential of non-motor interventions to induce neuroplastic changes that improve motor function.

However, the effects of BCI training with motor imagery (MI)-contingent feedback versus MI-independent feedback remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether the contingent connection between MI-induced brain activity and feedback influences functional and neural plasticity outcomes. We hypothesized that BCI training, with MI-contingent feedback, would result in greater improvements in upper limb function and neural plasticity compared to BCI training, with MI-independent feedback. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included persons with chronic stroke who underwent BCI training involving functional electrical stimulation feedback on the affected wrist extensor. Primary outcomes included the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale score for muscle strength in the wrist extensor (MRC-WE) and active range of motion in wrist extension (AROM-WE). Resting-state electroencephalogram recordings were used to assess neural plasticity. RESULTS: Compared to the MI-independent feedback BCI group, the MI-contingent feedback BCI group showed significantly greater improvements in MRC-WE scores (mean difference = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.03-1.00, p = 0.036) and demonstrated increased AROM-WE at 4 weeks post-intervention (p = 0.019). Enhanced functional connectivity in the affected hemisphere was observed in the MI-contingent feedback BCI group, correlating with MRC-WE and Fugl-Meyer assessment-distal scores. Improvements were also observed in the unaffected hemisphere's functional connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: BCI training with MI-contingent feedback is more effective than MI-independent feedback in improving AROM-WE, MRC, and neural plasticity in individuals with chronic stroke. BCI technology could be a valuable addition to conventional rehabilitation for stroke survivors, enhancing recovery outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CRIS (KCT0009013).",

      "abstract": "Available evidence suggests that various medical/rehabilitation treatments evoke multiple effects on blood hemostasis. It was therefore the aim of our study to examine whether fascial manipulation, vibration exercise, motor imagery, or neuro-muscular electrical stimulation can activate the coagulation system, and, thereby, expose patients to thrombotic risk. Ten healthy young subject were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were obtained pre and posttreatment. Besides standard laboratory methods, calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) and thrombelastometry (TEM) were used allowing sensitive detection of hyper- and hypocoagulable states. Application of fascial manipulation, motor imagery, or neuro-muscular electrical stimulation had vitually no effect whereas a single bout of vibration exercise caused significant coagulation activation. For example, TEM-derived coagulation times were significantly shortened (209 ± 34 vs. 187 ± 41 s, p = 0.0098) and CAT-derived thrombin peaks were significantly higher (235 ± 88 vs. 268 ± 82 nM, p = 0.0020) in post compared with preexercise samples. Moreover, vibration exercise, motor imagery, and neuro-muscular electrical stimulation caused significant plasma expansion (6.15%, 7.53%, and 3.88% plasma volume changes, respectively). We conclude that vibrational exercise apparently represents a potential procoagulant stimulus, and ongoing studies have to clarify whether VE should be applied particularly to patients with an elevated risk for thrombosis.",

Methods: A pre-post-intervention single-group study was conducted. One hundred forty-eight patients with chronic shoulder pain were included. All participants received a 6-week GMI program in addition to usual care. The primary outcome assessed was pain intensity using visual analog scale (VAS), the secondary outcomes were fear of movement with the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), catastrophization with the pain catastrophization scale (PCS), shoulder flexion active range of motion (AROM) with a goniometer, and central sensitization with the central sensitization inventory (CSI). All outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6-month and 1-year follow-up. Results: At 6 months, GMI showed to be statistically significant for all outcomes assessed (p < 0.001). At 1-year follow-up, the VAS showed a decrease of 3.3 cm (p < 0.001), TSK showed a decrease of 16.1 points (p < 0.001), PCS showed a decrease of 17.4 points (p < 0.001), AROM showed an increase of 29.9° (p < 0.001), and CSI showed a decrease of 17.9 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: At medium- and long-term follow-up, the individuals who received the GMI program in addition to usual care showed a clinically and statistically significant change for all outcomes assessed. Further studies, including clinical trials, are needed to confirm our findings."

PRIMER STUDY OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to examine motor imagery ability and its association with pain, functional status, neck awareness, and depression in individuals with chronic neck pain. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study, single-center. PARTICIPANTS: 60 individuals with chronic neck pain, aged between 18 and 65 years, were recruited. INTERVENTION: Demographic data was recorded, pain and disability were evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale and Neck Disability Index, motor imagery ability using Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire-20, and mental chronometry. Grip strength, cervical muscle endurance, upper limbs' functionality, neck awareness, and depression levels were assessed using a hydraulic hand dynamometer, cervical muscle endurance tests, Upper Extremity Functional Index-15, Fremantle Neck Awareness Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory, respectively. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Motor imagery ability, neck pain, functional status, neck awareness, and depression levels. RESULTS: Of the 60 individuals (mean age 51.60 ± 11.70 years), 83% (n = 50) were female. The Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire-20 score (mean 68.62 ± 27.02) was weakly correlated with Visual Analogue Scale-night (r = 0.332), duration of pain (r = -0.264), cervical extensor muscle endurance (r = -0.270) and Fremantle Neck Awareness Questionnaire (r = -0.295) (P < .05). Weak to moderate correlations were found between the individuals' mental chronometry task scores and Neck Disability Index, Fremantle Neck Awareness Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and grip strength (P < .05). The regression analysis indicates that motor imagery ability can explain pain intensity, cervical extensor endurance, neck awareness, and depression level (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Individuals with chronic neck pain showed an impaired motor imagery ability which was associated with pain, functional status, neck awareness, and depression levels. Thus improving motor imagery ability may contribute to better functional outcomes and psychosocial status in these individuals. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT06502236.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional myoelectric prostheses (myo-prostheses) training involves repetitive grasping and manipulation training, which requires considerable training time. It is necessary to develop a short and efficient myo-prostheses training. This study aimed to verify the immediate and sustained effects of action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) using virtual reality (VR) on myo-prostheses control and clarify the effect of visual feedback of electromyogram (EMG) signals during AOMI using VR. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated 24 healthy right-handed individuals wearing a myo-prostheses simulator in their dominant hands. We divided participants into 3 groups: VR video observation with EMG presentation during manipulation (VR+), VR video observation without EMG presentation (VR), and control group. We evaluated prosthetic control skills using the Grasp Force Adjustment Test (GFAT) and Bowknot task immediately before and after AOMI and 1 week later. In addition, we evaluated the level of immersion during AOMI. RESULTS: The rate of change in the GFAT 1 week after the intervention was significantly greater in the VR+ (P < 0.05, d = 1.32) and VR (P < 0.01, d = 2.34) groups than in the control group. Immersion was significantly higher in the VR+ and VR groups than in the control group. The condition and time required for GFAT had significant effects, although the post-hoc test showed no significant difference between VR+ and VR groups. CONCLUSIONS: AOMI using VR had sustained effects on motor learning of myo-prosthetic control despite EMG presentation. Therefore, AOMI, using VR, manipulates prostheses once learned, and it might be used for future training of myo-prosthetic control."

METHODS: The research involved twenty-three children with DMD and twelve healthy children. DMD cohort were randomized into two groups: treatment [Tele-MI training and telerehabilitation-based physiotherapy program (Tele-PTP), n = 12] and control (Tele-PTP, n = 11). MI ability [Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire-10 (KVIQ-10), Motor Imagery Questionnaire for Children (MIQ-C), mental chronometry tests], motor function [Motor Function Measure (MFM), North Star Ambulation Assessment, Four Square Step Test] and timed performance were assessed at baseline and after 8-week training. RESULTS: MI ability scores of DMD cohort were lower than healthy children. A large interaction effect was found for KVIQ-10 visual and total, MIQ-C internal visual and kinesthetic scores, and delta time of 10-meter walk test of mental chronometry (η2 > 0.14). The small-medium interaction effect was found in motor function and ambulation results (η2<0.14). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that Tele-MI training improved MI ability of DMD cohort. The small-to-medium effects of Tele-MI training on motor function, particularly those involving the trunk, have demonstrated its potential as a complementary approach in rehabilitation to improve motor functions in children with DMD.

DESIGN: Forty-six PwKOA were randomized (1:1) into the GMI and the TENS groups. Both groups participated in home-based and functional exercises. A visual analog scale (VAS), the pressure pain threshold, range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, the Timed Up and Go Test, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were evaluated at baseline, after 8 weeks of treatment, and after a 6-week follow-up period. RESULTS: The within-group comparisons showed significant improvements in outcomes for both treatments. However, the difference between the groups was significant in favor of the GMI group in knee flexion ROM, knee extensor muscle strength, and WOMAC-pain and WOMAC-function parameters at the end of the treatment, and VAS-activity, knee flexor muscle strength, and WOMAC-stiffness values showed greater improvement in the GMI group compared with the TENS group at the end of the 6-week follow-up (for all, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: GMI seems to be a more effective adjuvant than TENS. If applied in PwKOA, pain and functional recovery improved, and results were maintained for up to 6 weeks."

Forty-four healthy women were randomized into three groups: MI, AO, or sham observation (SO) group. The outcome measures included the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) condition (including basal tone and strength), lumbo-pelvic motor control, and pain sensitivity. All women performed six sessions at the rate of 3 s/week (for 2 weeks). An initial assessment was carried out (T0), another one 1-week after starting the study (T1), and a third one at the end (T2). Results showed significant PFM strength gains in MI and AO groups, but not in the SO group. Regarding lumbo-pelvic motor control, both MI and AO groups obtained statistically significant changes between pre- and post-intervention Additionally, only the AO group showed significant improvements already at 1-week of intervention. Finally, all groups showed improved pain sensitivity in the likely area of referred menstrual pain post-intervention, with only the MI group showing changes 1 week after starting the intervention. In conclusion, results showed that adding MI and AO to PE program leads to an improvement of sensorimotor function of PFM and related structures in general. Despite finding no statistically significant inter-group differences, some findings such as strength gains or the lumbo-pelvic motor control improvements were only found in MI and AO groups, and this should be considered clinically.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are common non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods for functional recovery after stroke. Motor imagery (MI) can be used in the rehabilitation of limb motor function after stroke, but its effectiveness remains to be rigorously established. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in the combined application of NIBS with MI, yet the evidence regarding its impact on the recovery of upper limb function after stroke is inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to demonstrate whether combining the two is superior to NIBS alone or MI alone to provide a reference for clinical decision-making. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Science Direct, CNKI, WANFANG, and VIP databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on the effects of MI combined NIBS in motor function recovery after stroke until February 2024. The outcomes of interest were associated with body functions or structure (impairment) and activity (functional). The primary outcome was assessed with the Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper extremity (FMA-UE) for motor function of the upper limbs and the modified Barthel Index (MBI) for the ability to perform daily living activities. For secondary outcomes, functional activity level was measured using wolf motor function test (WMFT) and action research arm test (ARAT), and cortical excitability was assessed using cortical latency of motor evoked potential (MEP-CL) and central motor conduction time (CMCT). The methodological quality of the selected studies was evaluated using the evidence‑based Cochrane Collaboration's tool. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the mean differences (MD) or the standard mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with random-effect models. RESULTS: A total of 14 articles, including 886 patients, were reviewed in the meta-analysis. In comparison with MI or NIBS alone, the combined therapy significantly improved the motor function of the upper limbs (MD = 5.43; 95% CI 4.34-6.53; P < 0.00001) and the ability to perform activities of daily living (MD = 11.07; 95% CI 6.33-15.80; P < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses showed an interaction between the stage of stroke, the type of MI, and the type of NIBS with the effect of the combination therapy. CONCLUSION: The combination of MI and NIBS may be a promising therapeutic approach to enhance upper limb motor function, functional activity, and activities of daily living after stroke.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motor imagery (MI) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease (PD). MI entails mentally rehearsing motor actions without executing them. This cognitive process has garnered attention due to its potential benefits in aiding motor function recovery in patients. The purpose of this review was to highlight the findings observed in motor symptoms, balance, gait, and quality of life. METHODS: A literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), from the first publication to February 2024. Studies with at least one keyword to PD and MI in the title were included. RESULTS: The analysis included 53 studies out of the 262 identified. These comprised 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an average PEDro score of 6.6 out of 10, as well as 41 non-RCT studies. Notably, the majority of the RCTs focused on balance, gait, and lower limb exercises. The experimental group found an 85.2% improvement on the Timed Up and Go (TUG) with a cognitive task (p < 0.02), 5.8% improvement on the TUG (p < 0.05), and 5.1% improvement in walking speed (p < 0.05). Other variables did not show significant improvement. In descriptive and non-RCT studies, there were various tasks and outcomes for the lower and upper limbs. It has been demonstrated that there was no difference in execution time in MI between patients and healthy subjects (HS), whereas motor execution was slower in patients. Several tasks were analyzed for the upper limb, including thumb opposition, joystick movements, and writing tasks with variable results. RCTs were more focused on balance, lower limbs, and walking. There was no specific outcome regarding the upper limb or speech. Additionally, the heterogeneity of tasks and outcomes across studies is also a limitation. CONCLUSION: Current research on walking disorders in PD shows promise, but further investigations are crucial, particularly with an emphasis on upper limb function and speech. Studies with larger sample sizes and more precise methodologies are needed to enhance our understanding of the potential benefits of MI within the framework of comprehensive PD rehabilitation."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Effective therapeutic strategies are crucial for managing genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPPPD), a condition presenting challenges for both patients and health care providers. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of an online graded motor imagery (GMI) program in alleviating pain intensity and improving sexual function in women diagnosed with GPPPD. METHODS: Eighty-seven women were randomly assigned to either an online GMI group or a control group. The online GMI protocol involved engaging participants in 2-week segments of left/right judgment exercises, mental simulation of movements, and gradual exposure therapy. After 6 weeks, we assessed pain intensity and sexual function. The control group gained access to the program upon study completion. RESULTS: The online GMI group demonstrated a significant reduction in pain intensity, coupled with improvements in sexual function. Notably, participants with enhanced movement imagery abilities experienced greater improvements, while those with negative beliefs and thoughts regarding vaginal penetration showed lower sexual function scores. CONCLUSION: An online GMI program is effective in alleviating the pain burden faced by women dealing with GPPPD. IMPACT: Effectively addressing pelvic pain in patients remains a daunting challenge for physical therapists. Therefore, implementing efficient and easily accessible strategies is crucial. The incorporation of GMI intervention proves to be an effective approach for improving both pain and sexual functioning in women with GPPPD.",

      "abstract": "Combination therapy with motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising therapy for poststroke neurorehabilitation. However, with patients' individual differences, the clinical effects vary greatly. This study aims to explore the hypothesis that stroke patients show individualized cortical response to rTMS treatments, which determine the effectiveness of rTMS-induced MI decoding enhancement. We applied four kinds of rTMS treatments respectively to four groups of subacute stroke patients, twenty-six patients in total, and observed their EEG dynamics, MI decoding performance, and Fugl-Meyer assessment changes following 2-week neuromodulation. Four treatments consisted of ipsilesional 10 Hz rTMS, contralesional 1 Hz rTMS, ipsilesional 1 Hz rTMS, and sham stimulation. Results showed stroke patients with different neural reorganization patterns responded individually to rTMS therapy. Patients with cortical lesions mostly showed contralesional recruitment and patients without cortical lesions mostly presented ipsilesional focusing. Significant activation increases in the ipsilesional hemisphere (pre: -15.7% ∓ 8.2%, post: -17.3% ∓ 8.1%, p = 0.037) and MI decoding accuracy enhancement (pre: 76.3 ± 13.8%, post: 86.6 ± 8.2%, p = 0.037) were concurrently found in no-cortical-lesion patients with ipsilesional activation treatment. In the group of patients without cortical lesions, recovery rate in those receiving ipsilesional activation therapy (23.5 ± 10.4%) was higher than those receiving ipsilesional suppression therapy (9.9 ± 9.3%) (p = 0.041). This study reveals that tailoring neuromodulation therapy by recognizing cortical activation patterns is promising for improving effectiveness of the combination therapy with BCI and rTMS.",

DESIGN: Randomized controlled, assessor-blind pilot trial with repeated-measure design. SETTING: Neurology outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two people with MS were randomly allocated to intervention (n=16) and control (n=16) groups. INTERVENTIONS: During the 8-week GMI training period, the first 2 weeks involved implicit MI training while 6 weeks of explicit MI training were conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the general pain intensity over the past 2 days, assessed with a visual analog scale, with a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 23 mm. Secondary outcomes included general pain and specific body parts' pain intensity over the past 7 days, neuropathic pain intensity, MI ability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, quality of life, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and cognitive functions scores. Assessments were conducted at baseline, at weeks 8 (post-treatment) and 12 (follow-up). RESULTS: The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in pain intensity over the past 2 days compared with control group (P<.05). Furthermore, at the 8-week assessment, the intervention group surpassed the MCID in pain intensity over the past 2 and 7 days (P<.05), whereas no significant change was observed in the control group (P>.05). Significant effects were observed post-treatment on general pain over the past 7 days, neuropathic pain, MI ability, fatigue, depression, quality of life, processing speed, and visuospatial memory within intervention group compared with control group (P<.05). However, the effect on anxiety, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and verbal memory between groups was not significant (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Telerehabilitation-based GMI training stands out as viable for the management of chronic pain and pain-related psychosocial symptoms for people with MS.",

Motor imagery (MI) and movement execution share neural pathways, but the relationship between imagined and executed movements in NSCLBP patients remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the temporal congruence between imagined and executed movements in NSCLBP sufferers, with secondary goals of investigating group differences in movement chronometry, psychological well-being, and disability, as well as possible correlations among these factors. Fifty-six participants, including 28 NSCLBP patients and 28 asymptomatic subjects (AS), performed lumbar flexion and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tasks. NSCLBP patients showed significant temporal incongruence in both tasks, executing movements more slowly than imagined, whereas AS displayed incongruence only in the TUG task. NSCLBP patients also took longer to imagine and execute lumbar flexion movements compared to AS, with correlations observed between execution delays, higher disability, and greater fear of movement. The findings highlight a lack of temporal congruence in NSCLBP patients, especially in lumbar flexion, emphasizing the complex relationship between chronic pain, motor ability, and psychological factors. These results suggest that integrated treatment approaches addressing cognitive and emotional aspects are crucial for managing NSCLBP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of numerous treatment modalities for frozen shoulder, spanning from nonsurgical approaches to surgical interventions, a consensus regarding the most effective treatment remains elusive. Current studies emphasize that pain in frozen shoulder affects central nervous system activity and leads to changes in cortical structures, which are responsible for processing sensory information (like pain) and controlling motor functions (like movement). These cortical changes highlight the importance of including the central nervous system in the management of frozen shoulder. It is therefore recommended that treatment should provide more effective management by focusing not only on the shoulder region but also on the cortical areas thought to be affected. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Among patients treated nonsurgically for frozen shoulder, is graded motor imagery added to a multimodal physical therapy program more effective than multimodal physical therapy alone in terms of (1) Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores, (2) pain with activities and QuickDASH (Q-DASH) scores, and (3) ROM after 8 weeks of treatment? METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, we considered the following as eligible for inclusion: (1) ROM < 50% compared with the unaffected shoulder, (2) clinically and radiologically confirmed primary frozen shoulder, and (3) 30% loss of joint ROM in at least two planes compared with the unaffected shoulder. Diagnosis of patients was based on patient history, symptoms, clinical examination, and exclusion of other conditions. A total of 38 patients with frozen shoulder were randomly assigned to either the graded motor imagery group (n = 19) or the multimodal physiotherapy group (n = 19). The groups did not differ in age, height, weight, gender, and dominant and affected side. In both groups, there were no losses to follow-up during the study period, and there was no crossover between groups. The multimodal physiotherapy program encompassed a variety of treatments, including stretching exercises, ROM exercises, joint-oriented mobilization techniques, scapular mobilization, strengthening exercises, and the application of cold agents. The graded motor imagery program, as an addition to the multimodal physiotherapy program, included the following steps: (1) left-right discrimination (identifying left and right body parts), (2) motor imagery (mentally visualizing movements), and (3) mirror therapy training (using mirrors to trick the brain into thinking the affected part is moving). Both groups of patients participated in a program of 12 sessions, each lasting approximately 45 minutes, twice a week for 6 weeks. Participants were assessed at baseline, after 6 weeks, and at 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the SPADI score, which ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values denoting greater disability. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for SPADI scores is reported to be 13.2 points. Secondary outcomes were shoulder ROM, Numeric Pain Rating Scale activity score (scored from 0 points, indicating \"no pain,\" to 10 points, indicating \"worst pain imaginable\"), and Q-DASH score (ranging from 0 to 100 points, with a higher score indicating higher functional disability). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare means between one or more variables based on repeated observations. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, patients treated with graded motor imagery plus multimodal physical therapy experienced greater mean ± SD improvement from baseline in terms of SPADI scores than did the multimodal physical therapy group (65 ± 9 versus 55 ± 12, mean difference 10 points [95% confidence interval 4 to 17 points]; p = 0.01). Graded motor imagery when added to standard therapy did not produce a clinically important difference in pain scores with activity compared with physical therapy alone (7.0 ± 1.3 versus 5.9 ± 1.4, mean difference 1 point [95% CI 0.2 to 2.0 points], which was below our prespecified MCID; p = 0.04). However, improvements in Q-DASH score at 8 weeks were superior in the graded motor imagery group by a clinically important margin (58 ± 6 versus 50 ± 10, mean difference 9 points [95% CI 3 to 14 points], which was below our prespecified MCID; p = 0.01). ROM was generally better in the group that received the program augmented by graded motor imagery, but the differences were generally small. CONCLUSION: Adding graded motor imagery to a multimodal physiotherapy program was clinically superior to multimodal physiotherapy alone in improving function in patients with frozen shoulder. However, no clinically superior scores were achieved in ROM or activity-related pain. Additionally, the follow-up period was short, considering the tendency of frozen shoulder to recur. Although adding graded motor imagery provides superiority in many scores and does not require high-budget equipment, the disadvantages such as the difference in some scores being sub-MCID and the need for expertise and experience should not be ignored. Consequently, while graded motor imagery shows promise, further research with longer follow-up periods is recommended to fully understand its benefits and limitations in the treatment of frozen shoulder.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tetraplegia causes extensive sensorimotor deficits affecting activity, participation and quality of life. People with C6-C7 tetraplegia can learn to grasp objects by performing wrist extension movement (ie, tenodesis grasp), and motor imagery (MI) added to rehabilitation significantly improved tenodesis grasp. We hypothesise that this improvement can be further boosted by adding neurofeedback during MI. Thus, we design a randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of MI training on grasping ability in people with C6-C7 tetraplegia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform a bicentric, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled study. During rehabilitation, 21 inpatients with C6-C7 tetraplegia will be allocated to MI with neurofeedback (MI training with graphical display on a computer screen based on mu (8-13 Hz) and beta (18-25 Hz) frequency rhythms measured with 32-channel electroencephalography), MI alone (only MI training) and control (watching movies and visualisation of geometric shapes). All participants will receive three 45-min training sessions per week for 5 weeks.The primary outcome measure will be wrist extension angle immediately after the intervention during tenodesis grasp measured with a 3D motion analysis system (VICON). Secondary outcomes will include a range of measures: kinematic, grip strength, upper limb range of motion, upper limb strength (manual muscle test and hand-held dynamometer measure), dexterity (box and block test, 9-hole peg test, Jebsen test, capabilities of upper extremity questionnaire), quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), daily life autonomy (Quadriplegic Index of Function), MI capacity and brain reorganisation (magnetoencephalography only available in Lyon, n=15). We will measure all outcomes five times: during weeks 1, 3 and 5 (baseline), week 11 (immediately after the intervention end) and week 18 (8 weeks after the intervention end). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted on 29 September 2017 (CPP Nord-Ouest-IV 17/25, N°2017-A00990-53). Dissemination will occur via presentation of results in scientific meetings and publication in peer-reviewed academic journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03190863 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

AIM: This trial aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of motor imagery based on action observation treatment in the rehabilitation of patients with dysphagia in Wallenberg syndrome. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The setting was in-patient. POPULATION: Thirty patients with dysphagia of Wallenberg syndrome. METHODS: The patients were divided into the experimental group and the control group. Both groups received conventional dysphagia treatment, and the experimental group underwent the addition of motor imagery based on action observation treatment to the control group once a day for 14 days. Overall swallowing function was assessed with specific scales before and after intervention. Meanwhile, the functional near infrared spectroscopy was used to detect changes in cerebral hemodynamics during the execution of volitional swallowing task and swallowing motor imagery. RESULTS: The standardized swallowing assessment score (P=0.030), Murray secretion scale score (P=0.044) and swallowing quality of life score (P=0.011) of the experimental group improved better than those of the control group. In addition, multiple brain regions of the cortical presented extensive activation (P<0.05) during the execution of swallowing motor imagery. Moreover, there were significant differences (P<0.05) in brain regions pre-motor and supplementary motor cortex, right primary motor cortex, and right primary somatosensory cortex of the experimental group before and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that motor imagery based on action observation treatment could improve swallowing function for patients with dysphagia of Wallenberg syndrome as an add-on training. As a top-down rehabilitation training, the mechanism of this therapy may be related to the selective activation of mirror neuron system. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Motor imagery based on action observation treatment can be implemented as part of the therapeutic for dysphagia of Wallenberg syndrome.",

We have developed the MOTor Imagery to Facilitate Sensorimotor re-learning (MOTIFS) training model which integrates dynamic motor imagery into physical rehabilitation. The objective is to report interim analysis results of an adaptive randomised controlled trial regarding the pre-defined continuation criteria. METHODS: Following a 12-week intervention in which participants were randomised to either MOTIFS or Care-as-Usual training, n=42 people undergoing rehabilitation for a traumatic knee injury were assessed for change from baseline to follow-up in psychological readiness to return to activity, using the ACL Return to Sport after Injury Scale (ACL-RSI), and side hop limb symmetry index. Continuation criteria included differences of ≥5 points in ACL-RSI and ≥8 points in side hop limb symmetry index in favour of the MOTIFS group. If these were not met, ≥5 points change in enjoyment was acceptable. RESULTS: Pre-defined continuation criteria were not met for ACL-RSI (mean difference -8.1 (SE 4.1)), side hop limb symmetry index (mean difference 4.4 (SE 7.8)), nor enjoyment (mean difference 3.9 (SE 4.5)), indicating that major modifications are required for continuation of the MOTIFS trial. CONCLUSION: While results of this interim analysis did not show differences in psychological readiness to return to activity or side hop performance, previous research shows that the MOTIFS model is positive and enjoyable. Further research is warranted to evaluate more appropriate outcomes related to the holistic nature of physical and psychological readiness to return to activity.

Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) and Mirror Therapy (MT) have emerged as potential non-invasive treatments; this review evaluates the effectiveness of these therapies in reducing pain, improving function, and managing swelling in CRPS patients. Methods: A systematic review was conducted including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated GMI and MT in CRPS patients. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024535972) to ensure transparency and adherence to protocols. This review included searches of PubMed, Cochrane, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases. Out of 81 studies initially screened, 6 were included in the final review. Studies were assessed for quality using the PEDro and RoB-2 scales. The primary outcomes were pain reduction, functional improvement, and swelling reduction. Results: Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) and Mirror Therapy (MT) reduced pain by an average of 20 points on the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) and resulted in functional improvements as measured by the Task-Specific Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). GMI also contributed to some reduction in swelling. MT, particularly in post-stroke CRPS patients, showed significant pain reduction and functional improvements, with additional benefits in reducing swelling in certain studies. However, the included studies had small sample sizes and mixed designs, which limit the generalizability of the findings. The studies varied in sample size and design, with some risk of bias noted. Conclusions: Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) and Mirror Therapy (MT) have proven to be effective interventions for managing Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), with significant improvements in pain reduction and functional recovery. These non-invasive treatments hold potential for integration into standard rehabilitation protocols. However, the small sample sizes and variability in study designs limit the generalizability of these findings. Future research should focus on larger, more homogeneous trials to validate the long-term effectiveness of GMI and MT, ensuring more robust clinical application."

      "abstract": "QUESTION: In stroke rehabilitation, what is the effect of adding non-stimulation-based priming prior to task-specific practice on activity and motor impairment outcomes compared with task-specific practice alone? DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Adult stroke survivors. INTERVENTION: The experimental groups completed a non-stimulation priming intervention prior to task-specific practice. The priming interventions were: motor imagery; action observation; combined motor imagery and action observation; mirror therapy; movement-based priming; and aerobic exercise-based priming. The control groups completed task-specific practice alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: Upper and lower limb activity and motor impairment. RESULTS: Twenty-four trials involving 803 participants were included in this systematic review. Twenty trials were included in the meta-analyses of activity outcomes and 11 trials in the meta-analyses of impairment outcomes. Four trials examined the effect of motor imagery priming prior to task-specific practice on activity outcomes (SMD 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.82). Three trials examined the effect of motor imagery priming prior to task-specific practice on motor impairment outcomes (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.89). Nine trials examined the effect of action observation priming prior to task-specific practice on activity outcomes (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.41). Two trials examined the effect of movement-based priming prior to task-specific practice on activity outcomes (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.42). Three trials examined the effect of aerobic exercise priming prior to task-specific practice on activity outcomes (SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.80). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. CONCLUSION: In stroke rehabilitation, motor imagery priming implemented prior to task-specific training has a very small to large effect on activity and motor impairment outcomes. Action observation priming implemented prior to task-specific training has a negligible to small effect on activity outcomes. Movement-based and aerobic exercise-based priming do not have any clear effect on outcomes. REGISTRATION: CRD42020093519.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN) occurs as a complication in 88% of all patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The intensity of pain has a direct impact on the function, levels of anxiety, kinesiophobia, fear of pain and fear of hypoglycemia, leading to reduction in the levels of physical activity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study will be to study the effects of Graded Motor Imagery (GMI), Graded exposure and Conventional Therapy on Quality of Life (QoL), pain, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophization and anxiety in participants with PDN. METHODS: This RCT will have three parallel groups with 30 participants in each group, calculated assuming partial eta squared value of 0.14, effect size of 0.403 at 85% power of the study and α error of 0.05 using G-power software. SETTING: The study will be conducted at OPD & IPD of a Tertiary Care Hospital in Goa-India. PARTICIPANTS: Participants with Type 1 or Type II diabetes in the age group of 18-75 years having a score of 3 or more on DN-4 will be included in the study. INTERVENTION: Group A will receive GMI, Group B will be given graded exposure & group C will be undergoing conventional physical therapy treatment. The intervention will last for 8 weeks and follow-up will be done after one month. Primary Outcome Measure: assessment using RAND SF-36, Visual Analogue Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia and Pain catastrophization will be done at 3 time points. CONCLUSION: This high quality RCT will provide important information about the efficacy of GMI on QoL, pain levels, pain catastrophization, kinesiophobia and anxiety. It will provide evidence for the use of cognitive intervention for pain and its associated factors, consistent with the biopsychosocial model of pain.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lower limb motor dysfunction is one of the most serious consequences of stroke; however, there is insufficient evidence for optimal rehabilitation strategies. Improving lower limb motor function through effective rehabilitation strategies is a top priority for stroke patients. Neuroplasticity is a key factor in the recovery of motor function. The extent to which neuroplasticity-based rehabilitation therapy using brain-computer interface (BCI) is effective in treating lower limb motor dysfunction in acute ischemic stroke patients has not been extensively investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of BCI rehabilitation on lower limb motor dysfunction in individuals with acute ischemic stroke by evaluating motor function, walking ability, and daily living activities. METHODS: This study was conducted in a randomized controlled trial, involving 64 patients with acute ischemic stroke who experienced lower limb motor dysfunction. All patients were divided into two groups, with 32 patients assigned to the control group was given conventional rehabilitation once a day for 70 min, 5 times a week for 2 weeks, and the experimental group (n = 32) was given BCI rehabilitation on top of the conventional rehabilitation for 1 h a day, 30 min of therapy in the morning and an additional 30 min in the afternoon, for a total of 20 sessions over a two-week period. The primary outcome was lower extremity motor function, which was assessed using the lower extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer Rating Scale (FMA-LE), and the secondary endpoints were the Functional Ambulation Scale (FAC), and the Modified Barthel index (MBI). RESULTS: After 20 sessions of treatment, both groups improved in motor function, walking function, and activities of daily living, and the improvements in FMA-LE scores (p < 0.001), FAC (p = 0.031), and MBI (p < 0.001) were more pronounced in the experimental group compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Conventional rehabilitation therapy combined with BCI rehabilitation therapy can improve the lower limb motor function of hemiplegic patients with stroke, enhance the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living, and promote the improvement of walking function, this is an effective rehabilitation policy to promote recovery from lower extremity motor function disorders."

Action observation (AO) and motor imagery (MI) therapies appear to facilitate motor planning influencing balance and gait relearning. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of AO and MI in isolation or combined (AO-MI), compared to sham interventions for the improvement of freezing of gait (FOG), speed, physical function and balance among individuals with PD. METHODS: PubMed, Web of science, PEDro, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to January 2024. Studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The study quality and risk of bias were assessed with PEDro scale and the Cochrane tool, respectively. The certainty of evidence was evaluated with GRADEpro GDT. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included, with a methodological quality ranged from fair to high. There were statistically significant results in FOG at follow-up when comparing AO to sham intervention (SMD= -0.50, 95% CI -0.88, -0.11; I2: 0%) 3 studies, 107 participants). Interventions based on MI compared to sham intervention were statistically significant in speed at post-treatment (MD = -0.06, 95% CI -0.04, -0.08; I2: 0%) and balance at post-treatment (SMD = -0.97; 95% CI -1.79, -0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Very low certainty of evidence was found proposing that: AO produce improvements in FOG at follow-up; and MI produce improvements in speed and balance at post-treatment."

      "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) is the mental representation of a movement without its execution. It activates internal representations of the movement without external stimulus through different memory-related processes. Although acute stress is frequent in the population and affects supraspinal structures essential for memory functionality, it is still unknown how that stress affects MI capacity and temporal congruence (TC) between execution and movement imagination. This study aimed to discover how acute stress may influence MI capacity and TC in the subscales of internal and external visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery. A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted. Sixty-two young, healthy subjects (mean age = 20.65 [2.54]; 39 females and 23 males) unfamiliar with the assessment and uses of MI were recruited. Participants were assigned by stratified randomization to the stress group or the control group. Stress was induced by the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST), while the control group performed the MAST control protocol. MI capacity and TC were assessed before (t1) and after (t2) MAST stress or control using the Movement Imagery Questionnaire-3 (MIQ-3). Electrodermal activity and heart rate variability were further recorded as control variables to assess stress induction. Thirty subjects in the stress group and 26 subjects in the control group were analyzed. No significant group differences were observed when comparing MI capacity or TC in any subscales. These findings suggest that acute stress does not significantly affect MI capacity or TC in young, healthy, non-experienced MI subjects. MI could thus be a relevant helpful technique in stressful situations.",

This study examined the influence of action observation (AO) perspective on the effectiveness of AOMI training for novices learning a 'shadow' Osoto Gari judo throw. Thirty novice participants were randomly assigned to AOMI training that displayed egocentric footage (AOMIEGO) or allocentric footage (AOMIALLO) of the Osoto Gari, or Control training. A motor learning design incorporating pre-test (Day 1), acquisition (Days 2-6), post-test (Day 7), and retention-test (Day 14) was adopted. Motor skill performance, self-efficacy, and mental representation structures were recorded as measures of learning. There were mixed effects for motor skill performance across the three training conditions utilized in this study, with AOMIALLO training significantly reducing error scores for final right hip flexion angle and peak right ankle velocity compared to AOMIEGO training. Self-efficacy increased for all training conditions over time. Both AOMIEGO and AOMIALLO training led to improved functional changes in mental representation structures over time compared to Control training. The findings suggest AOMI training led to improved perceptual-cognitive scaffolding, irrespective of AO perspective, and offer some support for the use of AOMIALLO training to facilitate novice learning of complex, serial motor skills in sport.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, motor imagery (MI) has been used as a supplementary treatment approach to regain physical function in patients with stroke. However, the baseline treatment and the quality of study methodology for new treatment approaches have improved. This systematic review examined the evidence published in the past few decades on the effectiveness of MI on upper- and lower-extremity function and functional performance in patients with stroke. A total of 29 randomized controlled and crossover trials that compared MI with other interventions were analyzed. In addition, the outcomes were grouped into upper-, lower-extremity function, and functional performance for data analysis. More than half of the upper-extremity function studies reported improved performance in Fugl-Meyer assessment, Wolf motor function test, and box and block test in both acute and chronic stages. Lower-extremity function and functional performance were primarily investigated using Fugl-Meyer assessment, gait speed and parameters, activities of daily living, and balance ability. When considering only high-quality studies, six of 15 on upper extremity reported significant effects, whereas five of 15 reported nonsignificant effects. In addition, six of 14 studies on gait and balance reported significant effects. This systematic review suggests that both MI training and conventional rehabilitation programs effectively enhance upper limb functional abilities, including improvements in gait speed and balance, in individuals with acute and chronic stroke. Although the studies published during the past few decades showed heterogeneity in onset after stroke, research protocol, training intensity, and research methodology quality, none of them reported the long-term effects.",

It aimed to explore how diaphragmatic breathing exercises influence these effects. Materials and Methods: This study included 30 participants, and Group 1 participated in 12 sessions of diaphragmatic breathing exercises under the supervision of a physiotherapist; Group 2 did not receive any intervention. For all the participants, mental fatigue was induced with motor imagery before and after the intervention, and evaluations were performed before and after mental fatigue. Upper extremity functions were evaluated using isometric elbow flexion strength, hand grip strength, upper extremity reaction time and endurance, finger reaction time, the nine-hole peg test, shoulder position sense, light touch-pressure threshold, and two-point discrimination. Results: The study results showed that after mental fatigue, there was a decrease in isometric elbow flexion strength, nondominant hand grip strength, and nondominant upper extremity endurance, and an increase in nondominant tactile sensation (p < 0.05). No changes were found in two-point discrimination, nine-hole peg test time, and position sense on either side (p > 0.05). The effect of mental fatigue on isometric elbow flexion strength and nondominant grip strength showed significant improvement following diaphragmatic breathing exercises (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study found that mental fatigue from motor imagery can impact elbow flexion, hand grip strength, upper extremity endurance, and tactile sensitivity. Breathing exercises may help improve strength parameters affected by mental fatigue. It is crucial to consider these effects on upper extremity functions in rehabilitation programs.",

The first MI group received MI guidance in addition to the balance training program, while the second Placebo group received only relaxation guidance. One-way ANOVA showed statistically significant results for all variables, both before and 4 weeks after the interventions for both groups. The t-test showed statistically significant differences between the two groups for static balance for the right lower extremity (t = 3.25, S (two-tailed) = 0.002, p < 0.05) and also for heart rate (final value) in all time phases. Further research is needed in order to establish MI interventions in sports trauma recovery using stronger MI treatments in combination with psychophysiological factors associated with sports rehabilitation."

However, the need for the evidence to support influence of imagery on performance is increasing. This study aims to investigate the impact of combining motor imagery with action observation on athletes' performance and performance perception. METHOD: Using a pre-test post-test design with a factorial setup, participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. A pre-research power analysis determined the sample size, resulting in 21 voluntary participants (10 male). Opto Jump device recorded drop jump performance measurements, while participants predicted their performance post-motor imagery and action observation practices. The experimental group underwent an 8-week AOMI intervention program, involving 24-minute motor imagery sessions during video observation thrice weekly. Post-test measurements were taken after the intervention. RESULTS: Results indicated no significant performance increase in the experimental group post-intervention, yet the group showed enhanced performance estimation following the video observation, but not in motor imagery condition. Conversely, this improvement was absent in the control group. DISCUSSION: Although AOMI intervention didn't enhance physical performance, it has positively affected athletes' perception toward their performance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing literature."

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of motor imagery (MI) training on sports performance is now well-documented. Recently, it has been proposed that a single session of MI combined with low frequency sound (LFS) might enhance muscle activation. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unknown. We set up a test-retest intervention over the course of 2 consecutive days to evaluate the effect of (i) MI training (MI, n = 20), (ii) MI combined with LFS (MI + LFS, n = 20), and (iii) a control condition (CTRL, n = 20) on force torque produced across repeated maximal voluntary contractions of the quadriceps before (Pretest), after (Posttest) and at +12 h (Retention) post-intervention. We collected the integrated electromyograms of the quadriceps muscles, as well as brain electrical potentials during each experimental intervention. In the CTRL group, total force torque decreased from Pretest to Retention and from Posttest to Retention. By contrast, there was an increase between Posttest and Retention in both MI + LFS and MI groups (both ηP2 = 0.03, p < 0.05). Regression analyses further revealed a negative relationship between force performance and EEG activity in the MI + LFS group only. The data support a transient interference of LFS on cortical activity underlying the priming effects of MI practice on force performance. Findings are discussed in relation to the potential for motor reprogramming through MI combined with LFS.",

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Izmir Tepecik Education and Research Hospital from August 2023 to January 2024. Seventy-six women with high-risk pregnancies were randomized into two groups: a motor imagery group (n = 38, diaphragmatic-breathing exercise and motor imagery-based physical activity) and a control group (n = 38, diaphragmatic-breathing exercise). Maternal well-being was determined using the Numerical Rating Scale-11. Digital sphygmomanometry was used to measure maternal heart rate and blood pressure, pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation, and cardiotocography for fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Assessments were performed pre-intervention, mid-intervention, and post-intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups (P > 0.05). There was a significant main effect of time in terms of maternal well-being and maternal heart rate (P = 0.001 and P = 0.015). In addition, there was a significant main effect of the group on oxygen saturation (P = 0.025). The overall group-by-time interaction was significant for maternal well-beingm with an effect size of 0.05 (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: The combination of diaphragmatic-breathing exercises and a motor imagery-based physical activity program in women with high-risk pregnancies was determined to have no adverse effects on the fetus, did not induce uterine contractions, and resulted in a significant improvement in maternal well-being and oxygen saturation. Thus, imagery-based physical activity can be used in high-risk pregnancies where physical activity and exercise are not recommended.",

      "abstract": "Research to improve and expand treatment options for motor impairment after stroke remains an important issue in rehabilitation as the reduced ability to move affected limbs is still a limiting factor in the selection of training content for stroke patients. The combination of action observation and peripheral nerve stimulation is a promising method for inducing increased excitability and plasticity in the primary motor cortex of healthy subjects. In addition, as reported in the literature, the use of action observation and motor imagery in conjunction has an advantage over the use of one or the other alone in terms of the activation of motor-related brain regions. The aim of the pilot study was thus to combine these findings into a multimodal approach and to evaluate the potential impact of the concurrent application of the three methods on dexterity in stroke patients. The paradigm developed accordingly was tested with 10 subacute patients, in whom hand dexterity, thumb-index pinch force and thumb tapping speed were measured for a baseline assessment and directly before and after the single intervention. During the 10-min session, patients were instructed to watch a repetitive thumb-index finger tapping movement displayed on a monitor and to imagine the sensations that would arise from physically performing the same motion. They were also repeatedly electrically stimulated at the wrist on the motorically more affected body side and asked to place their hand behind the monitor for the duration of the session to support integration of the displayed hand into their own body schema. The data provide a first indication of a possible immediate effect of a single application of this procedure on the dexterity in patients after stroke.",

The study followed the CARE guidelines. The patient meets the criteria for probable CBD, with neuroimaging evidence of exclusively cortical impairment. The patient underwent a non-invasive neuromodulation protocol involving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and action observation plus motor imagery (AO+MI). The neuromodulation protocol comprised 20 sessions involving tDCS over the primary motor cortex and combined AO+MI. Anodal tDCS was delivered a 2 mA excitatory current for 20 minutes. AO+MI focused on lower limb movements, progressing over four weeks with video observation and gradual execution, both weekly and monthly. The neuromodulation techniques were delivered online (i.e. applied simultaneously in each session). Outcome measures were obtained at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up (1 month later), and included motor (lower limb), cognitive/neuropsychological and functional assessments. Walking speed improvements were not observed, but balance (Berg Balance Scale) and functional strength (Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test) improved post-treatment. Long-term enhancements in attentional set-shifting, inhibitory control, verbal attentional span, and working memory were found. There was neurophysiological evidence of diminished intracortical inhibition. Functional changes included worsening in Cortico Basal Ganglia Functional Scale score. Emotional well-being and general health (SF-36) increased immediately after treatment but were not sustained, while Falls Efficacy Scale International showed only long-term improvement. The findings suggest potential benefits of the presented neuromodulation protocol for CBD patients, highlighting multifaceted outcomes in motor, cognitive, and functional domains."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several changes occur in the central nervous system with increasing age that contribute toward declines in mobility. Neurorehabilitation has proven effective in improving motor function though achieving sustained behavioral and neuroplastic adaptations is more challenging. While effective, rehabilitation usually follows adverse health outcomes, such as injurious falls. This reactive intervention approach may be less beneficial than prevention interventions. Therefore, we propose the development of a prehabilitation intervention approach to address mobility problems before they lead to adverse health outcomes. This protocol article describes a pilot study to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based, self-delivered prehabilitation intervention that combines motor imagery (mentally rehearsing motor actions without physical movement) and neuromodulation (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS; to the frontal lobes). A secondary objective is to examine preliminary evidence of improved mobility following the intervention. METHODS: This pilot study has a double-blind randomized controlled design. Thirty-four participants aged 70-95 who self-report having experienced a fall within the prior 12 months or have a fear of falling will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an active or sham tDCS group for the combined tDCS and motor imagery intervention. The intervention will include six 40-min sessions delivered every other day. Participants will simultaneously practice the motor imagery tasks while receiving tDCS. Those individuals assigned to the active group will receive 20 min of 2.0-mA direct current to frontal lobes, while those in the sham group will receive 30 s of stimulation to the frontal lobes. The motor imagery practice includes six instructional videos presenting different mobility tasks related to activities of daily living. Prior to and following the intervention, participants will undergo laboratory-based mobility and cognitive assessments, questionnaires, and free-living activity monitoring. DISCUSSION: Previous studies report that home-based, self-delivered tDCS is safe and feasible for various populations, including neurotypical older adults. Additionally, research indicates that motor imagery practice can augment motor learning and performance. By assessing the feasibility (specifically, screening rate (per month), recruitment rate (per month), randomization (screen eligible who enroll), retention rate, and compliance (percent of completed intervention sessions)) and acceptability of the home-based motor imagery and tDCS intervention, this study aims to provide preliminary data for planning larger studies.

The current study aims to investigate the feasibility of MI-BCI in upper limb rehabilitation of chronic stroke survivors and also to study the early event-related desynchronization after MI-BCI intervention. METHODS: Changes in the characteristics of sensorimotor rhythm modulations in response to a short brain-computer interface (BCI) intervention for upper limb rehabilitation of stroke-disabled hand and normal hand were examined. The participants were trained to modulate their brain rhythms through motor imagery or execution during calibration, and they played a virtual marble game during the feedback session, where the movement of the marble was controlled by their sensorimotor rhythm. RESULTS: Ipsilesional and contralesional activities were observed in the brain during the upper limb rehabilitation using BCI intervention. All the participants were able to successfully control the position of the virtual marble using their sensorimotor rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results support the feasibility of BCI in upper limb rehabilitation and unveil the capability of MI-BCI as a promising medical intervention. This study provides a strong platform for clinicians to build upon new strategies for stroke rehabilitation by integrating MI-BCI with various therapeutic options to induce neural plasticity and recovery."

Because of their characteristics, AO and MI have been proposed as techniques to facilitate the recovery of post-stroke hemiparesis in the upper extremities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An experimental, longitudinal, prospective, single-blinded design was undertaken. Eleven patients participated, and were randomly assigned to each study group. Both groups received 10 to 12 sessions of physical therapy. Five patients were assigned to the control treatment group, and six patients to the experimental treatment group (AO + MI). All were assessed before and after treatment for function, strength (newtons) and mobility (percentage) in the affected limb, as well as alpha desynchronisation (8-13 Hz) in the supplementary motor area, the premotor cortex and primary motor cortex while performing AO + MI tasks and action observation plus motor execution (AO + ME). RESULTS: The experimental group presented improvement in function and strength. A negative correlation was found between desynchronisation in the supplementary motor area and function, as well as a post-treatment increase in desynchronisation in the premotor cortex of the injured hemisphere in the experimental group only. CONCLUSIONS: An AO + MI-based intervention positively impacts recovery of the paretic upper extremity by stimulating the supplementary motor area, a cortex involved in movement preparation and learning. AO + MI therapy can be used as adjunctive treatment in patients with upper extremity paresis following chronic stroke.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most challenging aspect of rehabilitation is the repurposing of residual functional plasticity in stroke patients. To achieve this, numerous plasticity-based clinical rehabilitation programs have been developed. This study aimed to investigate the effects of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) rehabilitation programs on upper extremity hand function in patients with chronic hemiplegia. DESIGN: A 2010 Consolidated Standards for Test Reports (CONSORT)-compliant randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Forty-six eligible stroke patients with upper limb motor dysfunction participated in the study, six of whom dropped out. The patients were randomly divided into a BCI group and a control group. The BCI group received BCI therapy and conventional rehabilitation therapy, while the control group received conventional rehabilitation only. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) score was used as the primary outcome to evaluate upper extremity motor function. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were performed on all patients before and after treatment, in both the resting and task states. We measured the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), z conversion of ALFF (zALFF), and z conversion of ReHo (ReHo) in the resting state. The task state was divided into four tasks: left-hand grasping, right-hand grasping, imagining left-hand grasping, and imagining right-hand grasping. Finally, meaningful differences were assessed using correlation analysis of the clinical assessments and functional measures. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients completed the study, 20 in the BCI group and 20 in the control group. Task-related blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) analysis showed that when performing the motor grasping task with the affected hand, the BCI group exhibited significant activation in the ipsilateral middle cingulate gyrus, precuneus, inferior parietal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and contralateral middle cingulate gyrus. When imagining a grasping task with the affected hand, the BCI group exhibited greater activation in the ipsilateral superior frontal gyrus (medial) and middle frontal gyrus after treatment. However, the activation of the contralateral superior frontal gyrus decreased in the BCI group relative to the control group. Resting-state fMRI revealed increased zALFF in multiple cerebral regions, including the contralateral precentral gyrus and calcarine and the ipsilateral middle occipital gyrus and cuneus, and decreased zALFF in the ipsilateral superior temporal gyrus in the BCI group relative to the control group. Increased zReHo in the ipsilateral cuneus and contralateral calcarine and decreased zReHo in the contralateral middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, and superior temporal gyrus were observed post-intervention. According to the subsequent correlation analysis, the increase in the FMA-UE score showed a positive correlation with the mean zALFF of the contralateral precentral gyrus (r = 0.425, P < 0.05), the mean zReHo of the right cuneus (r = 0.399, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, BCI therapy is effective and safe for arm rehabilitation after severe poststroke hemiparesis. The correlation of the zALFF of the contralateral precentral gyrus and the zReHo of the ipsilateral cuneus with motor improvements suggested that these values can be used as prognostic measures for BCI-based stroke rehabilitation. We found that motor function was related to visual and spatial processing, suggesting potential avenues for refining treatment strategies for stroke patients.

Robotic devices have also been used by people with more challenging damages, such as Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), using feedback strategies that provide information about the brain activity in real-time. This study proposes a novel Motor Imagery (MI)-based Electroencephalogram (EEG) Visual Neurofeedback (VNFB) system for Lokomat® to teach individuals how to modulate their own μ (8-12 Hz) and β (15-20 Hz) rhythms during passive walking. Two individuals with complete SCI tested our VNFB system completing a total of 12 sessions, each on different days. For evaluation, clinical outcomes before and after the intervention and brain connectivity were analyzed. As findings, the sensitivity related to light touch and painful discrimination increased for both individuals. Furthermore, an improvement in neurogenic bladder and bowel functions was observed according to the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score, and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. Moreover, brain connectivity between different EEG locations significantly ( [Formula: see text]) increased, mainly in the motor cortex. As other highlight, both SCI individuals enhanced their μ rhythm, suggesting motor learning. These results indicate that our gait training approach may have substantial clinical benefits in complete SCI individuals.",

      "abstract": "Combined use of action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) is an increasingly popular motor-simulation intervention, which involves observing movements on video while simultaneously imagining the feeling of movement execution. Measuring and reporting participant imagery-ability characteristics are essential in motor-simulation research, but no measure of AOMI ability currently exists. Accordingly, the AOMI Ability Questionnaire (AOMI-AQ) was developed to address this gap in the literature. In Study 1, two hundred eleven participants completed the AOMI-AQ and the kinesthetic imagery subscales of the Movement Imagery Questionnaire-3 and Vividness of Motor Imagery Questionnaire-2. Following exploratory factor analysis, an 8-item AOMI-AQ was found to correlate positively with existing motor-imagery measures. In Study 2, one hundred seventy-four participants completed the AOMI-AQ for a second time after a period of 7-10 days. Results indicate a good test-retest reliability for the AOMI-AQ. The new AOMI-AQ measure provides a valid and reliable tool for researchers and practitioners wishing to assess AOMI ability.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Phantom limb pain affects 64% of amputees. Graded Motor Imagery comprises three consecutive application techniques designed to reorganize maladaptive changes that have occurred after the amputation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a home-based Graded Motor Imagery intervention, the GraMI protocol, for amputee people with phantom limb pain. METHODS: Twenty individuals over 18 years of age with upper or lower limb amputation, experiencing phantom limb pain, who were pharmacologically stable, and had been discharged from the hospital were recruited. The experimental group followed the GraMI protocol. Primary outcomes included study processes, such as recruitment time and rate, adherence, compliance, and the acceptability of digital technologies as a treatment tool. Secondary outcomes assessed the impact on phantom limb pain, quality of life, functionality, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: On average, seven participants were recruited monthly over a three-month period. No losses were recorded throughout the nine weeks of intervention. Treatment adherence averaged 89.32%, and all participants demonstrated familiarity with the usability of digital technologies. No significant differences were observed between groups (p = .054). However, within the experimental group, intragroup analysis revealed a significant (p = .005) and clinically relevant reduction (>2 points) with a large effect size (0.89) in phantom limb pain. CONCLUSION: Conducting a multicenter study with a home-based intervention using the GraMI protocol is feasible. Future clinical trials are needed to verify its effectiveness in managing phantom limb pain.",

      "abstract": "Since there is an upper limit to skill improvement through the repetition of actual execution, we examined whether motor imagery could be used in combination with actual execution to maximize motor skill improvement. Fingertip dexterity was evaluated in 25 healthy participants performing a force adjustment task using a pinch movement with the left thumb and index finger. In the intervention condition, six sets of repetitions of combined actual execution and motor imagery were performed, while in the control condition, the same flow was performed, but with motor imagery replaced by rest. Changes in the excitability of spinal motoneurons during motor imagery compared to rest were compared in terms of the F/M amplitude ratio. Motor skill changes were compared before and after repeated practice and between the conditions, respectively, using the absolute amount of adjustment error between the target pinch force value and the delivered pinch force value (absolute error) as an index. The results showed that the repetition of exercise practice and motor imagery decreased the absolute error, which was greater than that of exercise practice alone in terms of motor skill improvement. The F/M amplitude ratio for motor imagery compared to rest did not increase. This suggests that motor imagery is involved in the degree of the increase of spinal motoneuron excitability based on the real-time prediction of motor execution and that there may be no need for an increase in excitability during motor skill control."

We developed a novel virtual reality action observation and motor imagery (VR-AOMI) intervention and evaluated whether it could enhance the efficacy of mechanisms of neuroplasticity in the human motor cortex of healthy adults. A secondary question was to explore predictors of the change in neuroplasticity following VR-AOMI. A pre-registered, pilot randomized controlled cross-over trial was performed. Twenty right-handed adults (13 females; mean age: 23.0 ± 4.53 years) completed two experimental conditions in separate sessions; VR-AOMI and control. We used intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) to induce long term potentiation-like plasticity in the motor cortex and recorded motor evoked potentials at multiple timepoints as a measure of corticospinal excitability. The VR-AOMI task did not significantly increase the change in MEP amplitude following iTBS when compared to the control task (Group × Timepoint interaction p = 0.17). However, regression analysis identified the change in iTBS response following VR-AOMI was significantly predicted by the baseline iTBS response in the control task. Specifically, participants that did not exhibit the expected increase in MEP amplitude following iTBS in the control condition appear to have greater excitability following iTBS in the VR-AOMI condition (r = -0.72, p < 0.001). Engaging in VR-AOMI might enhance capacity for neuroplasticity in some people who typically do not respond to iTBS. VR-AOMI may prime the brain for enhanced neuroplasticity in this sub-group.",

METHODS: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Scopus were searched from inception to May 2023. We included randomized controlled trials that examine the effects of MI on individuals with Parkinson's disease. Two reviewers selected articles and extracted study characteristics and results independently. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale was used to assess the methodological quality. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: Thirteen articles with 12 studies were included, involving 320 individuals with Parkinson's disease, with moderate to high methodological quality (mean = 6.62/10). Compared with the control group, 3 articles reported significant greater improvements in cognitive function, 7 reported significant greater improvement in motor function, 1 article reported significant greater improvement in quality of life, and 1 reported significant greater confidence in daily task performance. No statistically significant effects were found in the meta-analyses. Conclusion. Results of individual articles were in favor of the MI intervention. No statistically significant results were found in the meta-analyses. This might be due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures used. MI may be effective in improving some rehabilitation outcomes, but meta-analytic evidence is lacking. More research with larger sample size and less heterogeneous samples, interventions, and outcome measures, is warranted. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number CRD42021230556.",

The study aimed to investigate the effects on manual dexterity of AOMI delivered through immersive VR compared to AOMI administered through a laptop. To evaluate whether VR can enhance the effects of AOMI, forty-five young volunteers were enrolled and randomly assigned to the VR-AOMI group, who underwent AOMI through immersive VR, the AOMI group, who underwent AOMI through a laptop screen, or the control group, who observed landscape video clips. All participants underwent a 5-day treatment, consisting of 12 min per day. We investigated between and within-group differences after treatments relative to functional manual dexterity tasks using the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT). This test included right hand (R), left hand (L), both hands (B), R + L + B, and assembly tasks. Additionally, we analyzed kinematics parameters including total and sub-phase duration, peak and mean velocity, and normalized jerk, during the Nine-Hole Peg Test to examine whether changes in functional scores may also occur through specific kinematic patterns. Participants were assessed at baseline (T0), after the first training session (T1), and at the end of training (T2). A significant time by group interaction and time effects were found for PPT, where both VR-AOMI and AOMI groups improved at the end of training. Larger PPT-L task improvements were found in the VR-AOMI group (d: 0.84, CI95: 0.09-1.58) compared to the AOMI group from T0 to T1. Immersive VR used for the delivery of AOMI speeded up hand dexterity improvements."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were systematically searched in five electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, OVID Nursing and CINAHL) from inception to 30 December 2022. Studies investigating MITs, targeted at individuals after stroke were eligible. Data were extracted related to study and intervention characteristics. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included. Compared with 'routine methods of treatment or training', the meta-analyses showed that MIT was more effective in improving cadence immediately post intervention (SMD: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.85, p = 0.0001, I2 = 25%) and at 1- or 2-months post intervention (SMD: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.35, 1.20, p = 0.0004, I2 = 46%). The results also showed that MIT improves the step length of the affected side and the unaffected side at 1- or 2-months post intervention. Separate meta-analyses were also conducted on different tests of walking endurance (assessed by the 6-Minute Walk Test) and functional mobility (assessed by the Timed-Up-and-Go test). CONCLUSIONS: MIT effectively improved gait performance. The findings in individuals after stroke remain inconclusive due to significant heterogeneity in included studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The therapeutic benefits of motor imagery (MI) are now well-established in different populations of persons suffering from central nervous system impairments. However, research on similar efficacy of MI interventions after amputation remains scarce, and experimental studies were primarily designed to explore the effects of MI after upper-limb amputations. OBJECTIVES: The present comparative study therefore aimed to assess the effects of MI on locomotion recovery following unilateral lower-limb amputation. METHODS: Nineteen participants were assigned either to a MI group (n = 9) or a control group (n = 10). In addition to the course of physical therapy, they respectively performed 10 min per day of locomotor MI training or neutral cognitive exercises, five days per week. Participants' locomotion functions were assessed through two functional tasks: 10 m walking and the Timed Up and Go Test. Force of the amputated limb and functional level score reflecting the required assistance for walking were also measured. Evaluations were scheduled at the arrival at the rehabilitation center (right after amputation), after prosthesis fitting (three weeks later), and at the end of the rehabilitation program. A retention test was also programed after 6 weeks. RESULTS: While there was no additional effect of MI on pain management, data revealed an early positive impact of MI for the 10 m walking task during the pre-prosthetic phase, and greater performance during the Timed Up and Go Test during the prosthetic phase. Also, a lower proportion of participants still needed a walking aid after MI training. Finally, the force of the amputated limb was greater at the end of rehabilitation for the MI group. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data support the integration of MI within the course of physical therapy in persons suffering from lower-limb amputations.",

Due to requirements for imagining before performing a MI intervention and because there are few instruments available for assessing this specific ability in the pelvic floor musculature, we sought to develop and test a new MI questionnaire, the Kinesthetic Motor Imagery of Pelvic Floor Muscle Contraction Questionnaire (KMI-PFQ). We focused in this study on the development and analysis of the instrument's factorial structure and internal reliability in a participant sample of 162 healthy Spanish women (M age = 20.1, SD = 2.2 years). We developed and evaluated the KMI-PFQ's psychometric properties, finding it to have good internal consistency, with Cronbach's α = .838, ω coefficient = .839, and an intraclass correlation coefficient = .809, with two factors (\"ability\" and \"mental effort\") explaining 58.36% of response variance. The standard error of measurement was 3.58, and the minimal detectable change was 9.92. No floor or ceiling effects were identified. There was also good convergent validity as seen by statistically significant positive correlations between KMI-PFQ scores and the revised-Movement Image Questionnaire and Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire. There were no statistically significant correlations between KMI-PFQ scores and the Orientation to Life Questionnaire.

OBJECTIVES: Review of the best-available evidence on the use and efficacy of MI interventions for neurorehabilitation purposes in common and rare childhood neurological disorders. METHODS: systematic literature search conducted according to PRISMA by using the Scopus, PsycArticles, Cinahl, PUBMED, Web of Science (Clarivate), EMBASE, PsychINFO, and COCHRANE databases, with levels of evidence scored by OCEBM and PEDro Scales. RESULTS: Twenty-two original studies were retrieved and included for the analysis; MI was the unique or complementary rehabilitative treatment in 476 individuals (aged 5 to 18 years) with 10 different neurological conditions including, cerebral palsies, stroke, coordination disorders, intellectual disabilities, brain and/or spinal cord injuries, autism, pain syndromes, and hyperactivity. The sample size ranged from single case reports to cohorts and control groups. Treatment lasted 2 days to 6 months with 1 to 24 sessions. MI tasks were conventional, graded or ad-hoc. MI measurement tools included movement assessment batteries, mental chronometry tests, scales, and questionnaires, EEG, and EMG. Overall, the use of MI was stated as effective in 19/22, and uncertain in the remnant studies. CONCLUSION: MI could be a reliable supportive/add-on (home-based) rehabilitative tool for pediatric neurorehabilitation; its clinical use, in children, is highly dependent on the complexity of MI mechanisms, which are related to the underlying neurodevelopmental disorder."

Following the discovery of mirror neurons, new techniques were developed based on the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, such as motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO). We propose a protocol using electromyographic recordings of forearm muscles in people who have suffered a stroke during an MI task and an AO task. Three different experimental conditions will be studied during the electromyographic recordings: control recording, recording during MI, and recording during AO.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motor imagery is a cognitive process that involves mentally simulating movements without physical execution. It has been studied in the context of foot pain to understand the role of motor cortical reorganization and its impact on motor imagery abilities. However, further research is needed to establish consistent evidence regarding the relationship between motor imagery and foot pain. METHODS: This review analyzed five relevant articles that investigated motor imagery in the context of foot pain. The studies involved participants with various conditions, including leg amputation, chronic leg pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and Achilles tendinopathy. Different methodologies were employed, including motor cortical mapping, foot laterality recognition tasks, EEG recordings, and treatment interventions incorporating motor imagery. RESULTS: The findings indicated that individuals with leg amputation exhibited functional reorganization in upper limb motor cortical maps, with a breakdown in the inhibitory relationship between foot and hand representations. Participants with chronic leg pain demonstrated slower and less accurate performance on foot laterality recognition tasks compared to healthy controls. Complex regional pain syndrome patients displayed distinct motor imagery strategies and responded differently to first-person and third-person perspectives. EEG studies revealed differences in brain activity during motor imagery tasks under pain-free and pain conditions. Treatment interventions incorporating motor imagery showed promising outcomes in improving functional outcomes and reducing pain levels. CONCLUSIONS: Motor imagery plays a significant role in foot pain conditions, although the evidence is still emerging. The findings suggest that motor imagery abilities may be affected by leg amputation, chronic pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols for assessing motor imagery, identify specific patient populations that may benefit most from motor imagery interventions, and explore long-term effects. Integrating motor imagery into clinical practice has the potential to enhance rehabilitation approaches and improve outcomes in foot pain management.",

DESIGN: Clinical trial following an AB/BA crossover design with counterbalanced assignment. SUBJECTS: Twenty individuals with subacute (n = 4) or chronic stroke (n = 16). METHODS: Ten consecutive sessions of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation alone (therapy A) were compared vs a combination of10 consecutive sessions of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with 12 non-consecutive sessions of motor imagery-based neurofeedback training (therapy B). Patients received both therapies (1-month washout period), in sequence AB or BA. Participants were assessed before and after each therapy and at 15-days follow-up, using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-upper limb, hand-grip strength, and the Nottingham Sensory Assessment as primary outcome measures. RESULTS: Both therapies resulted in improved functionality and sensory function. Therapy B consistently exhibited superior effects compared with therapy A, according to Fugl-Meyer Assessment and tactile and kinaesthetic sensory function across multiple time-points, irrespective of treatment sequence. No statistically significant differences between therapies were found for hand-grip strength. CONCLUSION: Following subacute and chronic stroke, integrating bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and motor imagery-based neurofeedback training has the potential to enhance functional performance compared with using bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation alone in upper limb recovery.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, mostly affecting balance and motor function caused mainly by a lack of dopamine in the brain. The use of virtual reality (VR) and motor imagery (MI) is emerging as an effective method of rehabilitation for people with Parkinson's disease. Motor imagery and virtual reality have not been compared in patients with Parkinson's disease. This randomized clinical trial is unique to compare the effects of virtual reality with routine physical therapy, motor imagery with routine physical therapy, and routine physical therapy alone on balance, motor function, and activities of daily living in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: A total of sixty patients with Parkinson's disease were randomized into three groups using lottery method; twenty with virtual reality therapy in addition to physical therapy (group A = VR + RPT), twenty with imagery therapy in addition to physical therapy (group B = MI + RPT), and twenty were treated with only routine physical therapy (group C = RPT). All patients were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for motor function and activities of daily living, the Berg balance scale (BBS) for balance, and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABCs) for balance confidence at baseline, six and twelve weeks, and one month after treatment discontinuation. The one-way ANOVA was used to compare the outcomes between three groups, and the repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the outcomes within each of the three groups at a significance level of p-value = 0.05. RESULTS: According to UPDRS III, the VR + RPT group showed significant improvement in motor function, compared to the MI + RPT and RPT groups, as the Mean ± SD at baseline was 33.95 ± 3.501 and at the 12-week assessment was 17.20 ± 9.451 with a p-value = 0.001. In the VR + RPT group, the BBS score at baseline was 37.15 ± 3.437 and at 12th week was 50.10 ± 4.897 with a p-value = 0.019. Among the VR + RPT group, the ABCS score showed significant improvement as the M ± SD at baseline was 57.95 ± 4.629, and at the 12th week was 78.59 ± 6.386 with a p-value = 0.010. At baseline, the UPDRS II for activities of daily living in the VR + RPT group was 25.20 ± 3.036 and at 12th week it was 15.30 ± 2.364 with p-value of 0.000. CONCLUSION: The current study found that the combination of VR and RPT proved to be the most effective treatment method for improving balance, motor function, and activities of daily living in patients with Parkinson's disease when compared to MI + RPT or RPT alone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motor imagery therapy (MIT) showed positive effects on upper limbs motor function. However, the mechanism by which MIT improves upper limb motor function is not fully understood. Therefore, our purpose was to investigate the changes in functional connectivity (FC) within and outside the sensorimotor network (SMN) induced by MIT associated with improvement in upper limb motor function in stroke patients. METHODS: A total of 26 hemiplegic stroke patients were randomly divided into MIT (n = 13) and control (n = 13) groups. Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity Scale (FMA-UL), Modified Barthel Index (MBI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were evaluated in the two groups before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment. The efficacy of MIT on motor function improvement in stroke patients with hemiplegia was evaluated by comparing the FMA-UL and MBI scores before and after treatment in the two groups. Furthermore, the FC within the SMN and between the SMN and the whole brain was measured and compared before and after different treatment methods in stroke patients. The correlation analysis between the improvement of upper limbs motor function and changes in FC within the SMN and between the SMN and the whole brain was examined. RESULTS: The FCs between ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1.I) and contralateral supplementary motor area (SMA.C), M1.I and ipsilesional SMA (SMA.I), and SMA.C and contralateral dorsolateral premotor cortex (DLPM.C) significantly increased in the control group but decreased in the MIT group; while the FC between SMA.C and contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1.C) significantly increased in the control group but showed no significant difference in the MIT group. The FCs between M1.I and the ipsilesional hippocampal gyrus and ipsilesional middle frontal gyrus significantly decreased in the control group but increased in the MIT group; while the FC in the contralateral anterior cingulate cortex significantly increased in the MIT group but there was no significant difference in the control group. The results of the correlation analysis showed that the differences in abnormal intra-FCs within the SMN negatively correlated with the differences in FMA and MBI, and the difference in abnormal inter-FCs of the SMN positively correlated with the differences in FMA and MBI. CONCLUSIONS: MIT can improve upper limb motor function and daily activities of stroke patients, and the improvement effect of conventional rehabilitation therapy (CRT) combined with MIT is significantly higher than that of CRT alone. CRT may improve the upper limb motor function of stroke patients with hemiplegia mainly through the functional reorganization between SMN, while MIT may mainly increase the interaction between SMN and other brain networks."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of permanent movement and posture disorders. Motor imagery (MI) therapy is known to provide potential benefits, but data on MI ability in children and adolescents with CP is lacking. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was performed to explore MI abilities in children and adolescents with CP compared to typically developed (TD) subjects. METHODS: We searched on PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), EBSCO, Google Scholar, and PEDro including observational studies. Methodological quality was assessed with the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and evidence map was created to synthesize the evidence qualitatively and quantitatively. RESULTS: Seven cross-sectional studies were selected, which included 174 patients with CP and 321 TD subjects. Three studies explored explicit MI, two MI-execution synchrony, and four implicit MI domains. Methodological quality ranged from 6 to 8 stars. Moderate evidence supported the absence of differences in vividness between the groups. As there was only limited evidence, establishing a clear direction for the results was not possible, especially for the capacity to generate MI, mental chronometry features, and MI-execution synchrony domains. Moderate evidence supported a lower efficiency in cases for hand recognition, derived from a lower accuracy rate, while reaction time remained similar between the two groups. Moderate evidence indicated that patients with CP and TD controls showed similar features on whole-body recognition. CONCLUSION: Moderate evidence suggests that patients with CP present a reduced ability in hand recognition, which is not observed for whole-body recognition compared to healthy controls. Severe limitations concerning sample size calculations and validity of assessment tools clearly limits establishing a direction of results, especially for explicit MI and MI-Execution synchrony domains. Further research is needed to address these limitations to enhance our comprehension of MI abilities in children, which is crucial for prescribing suitable MI-based therapies in this child population."

METHODS: Twenty-three inpatients with stroke were selected, and 21 right-handed healthy individuals were recruited. EEG signal during hand MI and ME (synergy and isolated movements) was recorded. Correlations between functional brain areas during MI and ME were compared. RESULTS: PMA and MA were significantly and positively correlated during hand MI in all participants. The power spectral density (PSD) values of PMA EEG signals were greater than those of MA during MI and ME in both groups. The functional connectivity correlation was higher in the stroke group than in healthy people during MI, especially during left-handed MI. During ME, functional connectivity correlation in the brain was more enhanced during synergy movements than during isolated movements. The regions with abnormal functional connectivity were in the 18th lead of the left PMA area. CONCLUSION: Left-handed MI may be crucial in MI therapy, and the 18th lead may serve as a target for non-invasive neuromodulation to promote further recovery of limb function in patients with stroke. This may provide support for the EEG theory of neuromodulation therapy for hemiplegic patients."

Early sleep after motor practice represents a strategy to enhance the consolidation of trained skills. Here, we investigated the effects of AOMI followed by early sleep on gait and balance performance in older adults. Forty-five older adults (mean age: 70.4 ± 5.2 years) were randomized into three groups performing a 3-week training. Specifically, AOMI-sleep and AOMI-control groups underwent observation and motor imagery of gait and balance tasks between 8:00 and 10:00 p.m. or between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. respectively, whereas Control group observed landscape video-clips. Participants were assessed for gait performance, static and dynamic balance and fear of falling before and after training and at 1-month follow-up. The results revealed that early sleep after AOMI training sessions improved gait and balance abilities in older adults compared to AOMI-control and Control groups. Furthermore, these benefits were retained at 1-month after the training end. These findings suggested that early sleep after AOMI may represent a safe and easy-applicable intervention to minimize the functional decay in older adults.",

Then, we retrospectively analysed the differences in brain structure of these groups before the MI training, identifying brain regions that may predict the effect of MI on NP. Thirty pediatric CSCI patients were included, including 12 patients who experienced NP during MI and 18 patients who did not experience NP during MI according to the MI training follow-up. The 3D high-resolution T1-weighted images of all subjects were obtained using a 3.0 T MRI system before MI training. A two-sample t-test was performed to evaluate the differences in gray matter volume (GMV) between patients who experienced NP and those who did not experience NP during MI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compute the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging biomarkers for the effect of MI on NP in pediatric CSCI patients. MI evoked NP in some of the pediatric CSCI patients. Compared with patients who did not experience NP, patients who experienced NP during MI showed larger GMV in the right primary sensorimotor cortex (PSMC) and insula. When using the GMV of the right PSMC and insula in combination as a predictor, the area under the curve (AUC) reached 0.824. Our study demonstrated that MI could evoke NP in some pediatric CSCI patients, but not in others. The individual differences in brain reorganization of the right PSMC and insula may contribute to the different effects of MI on NP. Moreover, the GMV of the right PSMC and insula in combination may be an effective indicator for screening pediatric CSCI patients before MI training therapy."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Social disturbance is a significant autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptom. Action representation, which is a fundamental component of social interaction, can be investigated through kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI). KMI has been commonly studied with the well-developed laterality judgment paradigm, wherein participants are required to discriminate the laterality of a hand rotated by different angles along one or more axes. Here, we investigated the KMI processing in individuals with ASD by hand laterality judgment paradigm with eye-tracking methodology. METHODS: The current study included 22 participants with ASD and 22 typical developing (TD) peers matched for age, gender, and intelligence. Participants were asked to judge the laterality of hand-with-tooth brush images. RESULTS: Compared to the TD controls, individuals with ASD performed KMI with lower accuracy and longer response time in both correct and incorrect action conditions. The incorrect action representation had greater effect on KMI for individuals with ASD. Differences in eye-movement patterns were also observed, characterized by individuals with ASD were more focused on the object area while TD peers were more focused on the hand area. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that while altered KMI performance was observed, the incorrect action representation elicited more engagement of KMI in both groups. The object-centered eye-movement pattern may contribute to the refine of motor simulation intervention for individuals with ASD."

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in various electronic databases to identify all relevant studies: PubMed, CINAHL, WOS, PEDro, CENTRAL, and Scopus. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of MI in individuals with CRPS were included. The risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, the methodological quality was evaluated using PEDro scale, and the level of evidence was reported according to the GRADE. Between-groups standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated. RESULTS: Six studies were included. The meta-analysis found moderate-quality evidence that MI improves pain intensity and related disability as immediate (pain: SMD -1.07, 95% CI: -1.53 to -0.60; disability: SMD 1.05, 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.51), short-term (pain: SMD -1.28, 95% CI: -2.14 to -0.42; disability: SMD 1.37; 95% CI: 0.16 to 2.58), and long-term effects (pain: SMD -1.18; 95% CI: -1.89 to -0.46; disability: SMD 1.18; 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.89), as compared with a comparison group. The risk of bias of the trials was relatively low, but the imprecision of the results downgraded the level of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-quality evidence suggests a positive effect of MI for improving pain intensity and disability immediately after and at short-term in individuals with CRPS.",

This narrative review summarizes why, how, and when applying AO and MI training in individual with PD. We report the neural underpinning of AO and MI and their effects on motor learning. We examine the characteristics and the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions and we provide suggestions about their implementation with technologies. Neurophysiological data suggest a substantial correct activation of brain networks underlying AO and MI in people with PD, although the occurrence of compensatory mechanisms has been documented. Regarding the efficacy of training, in general evidence indicates that both these techniques improve mobility and functional activities in PD. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to variety of the study designs, training characteristics, and the modalities in which AO and MI were applied. Finally, results on long-term effects are still uncertain. Several elements should be considered to optimize the use of AO and MI in clinical setting, such as the selection of the task, the imagery or the video perspectives, the modalities of training. However, a comprehensive individual assessment, including motor and cognitive abilities, is essential to select which between AO and MI suite the best to each PD patients. Much unrealized potential exists for the use AO and MI training to provide personalized intervention aimed at fostering motor learning in both the clinic and home setting.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Restorative Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) that combine motor imagery with visual feedback and functional electrical stimulation (FES) may offer much-needed treatment alternatives for patients with severely impaired upper limb (UL) function after a stroke. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine if BCI-based training, combining motor imagery with FES targeting finger/wrist extensors, is more effective in improving severely impaired UL motor function than conventional therapy in the subacute phase after stroke, and if patients with preserved cortical-spinal tract (CST) integrity benefit more from BCI training. METHODS: Forty patients with severe UL paresis (< 13 on Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) were randomized to either a 12-session BCI training as part of their rehabilitation or conventional UL rehabilitation. BCI sessions were conducted 3-4 times weekly for 3-4 weeks. At baseline, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was performed to examine CST integrity. The main endpoint was the ARAT at 3 months post-stroke. A binominal logistic regression was conducted to examine the effect of treatment group and CST integrity on achieving meaningful improvement. In the BCI group, electroencephalographic (EEG) data were analyzed to investigate changes in event-related desynchronization (ERD) during the course of therapy. RESULTS: Data from 35 patients (15 in the BCI group and 20 in the control group) were analyzed at 3-month follow-up. Few patients (10/35) improved above the minimally clinically important difference of 6 points on ARAT, 5/15 in the BCI group, 5/20 in control. An independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test revealed no differences between the two groups, p = 0.382. In the logistic regression only CST integrity was a significant predictor for improving UL motor function, p = 0.007. The EEG analysis showed significant changes in ERD of the affected hemisphere and its lateralization only during unaffected UL motor imagery at the end of the therapy. CONCLUSION: This is the first RCT examining BCI training in the subacute phase where only patients with severe UL paresis were included. Though more patients in the BCI group improved relative to the group size, the difference between the groups was not significant. In the present study, preserved CTS integrity was much more vital for UL improvement than which type of intervention the patients received. Larger studies including only patients with some preserved CST integrity should be attempted.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of graded motor imagery therapy (GMI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on upper extremity function alone and in combination in patients with stroke. DESIGN: This was a prospective randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=56) were randomized into GMI (n=19), rTMS (n=18), or combined groups (n=19). INTERVENTIONS: There were 2 interventions: (1) 20 minutes of 1 Hz rTMS. (2) 30 minutes of GMI. In addition to this, all participants receive conventional rehabilitation including 120 minutes of physical therapy and occupational therapy daily. All treatments were administered once a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer assessment of upper extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), modified Barthel Index (MBI), motor activity log (MAL), and motor evoked potential (MEP) were assessed in a blinded manner at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the improvement from baseline in FMA-UE for stroke patients at 4 weeks. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, the FMA-UE scores in the GMI, rTMS, and combined groups were higher than those at baseline assessment, with statistically significant differences among the 3 groups (P=.009). The efficacy of the combined group was significantly better than that of the GMI and rTMS groups (P=.015, P=.043, respectively). In the motor activity log-amount of use (MAL-AOU) score, the efficacy of the combined group was better than that of the rTMS group (P=.035). CONCLUSIONS: Both GMI and rTMS were effective in improving upper extremity function in patients with stroke, but the combination of the 2 techniques was more effective. However, GMI was better than rTMS in improving the interest of stroke patients in active training.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive training techniques such as motor imagery (MI)-cognitive simulation of movement, has been found to successfully facilitate skill acquisition. The MI literature emphasizes the need to accurately imitate key elements of motor execution to facilitate improved performance outcomes. However, there is a scarcity of MI research investigating how contemporary approaches to motor learning, such as nonlinear pedagogy (NLP), can be integrated into MI practice. Grounded in an ecological dynamics approach to human movement, NLP proposes that skilled action is an emergent process that results from continuous interactions between perceptual information of the environment and movement. This emergent process can be facilitated by the manipulation of key task constraints that aim to encourage learners to explore movement solutions that satisfy individual constraints (e.g., height and weight) and achieve successful performance outcomes. The aim of the present study was to explore the application of a NLP approach to MI approach for skill acquisition. Fourteen weightlifting beginners (two female and 12 male) participated in a 4-week intervention involving either NLP (i.e. analogy-based instructions and manipulation of task constraints) or a linear pedagogy (LP; prescriptive instructions of optimal technique, repetition of same movement form) to learn a complex weightlifting derivative. Performance accuracy, movement criterion (barbell trajectory type), kinematic data, and quantity of exploration/exploitation were measured pre-mid-post intervention. No significant differences (p = .438) were observed in the amount of exploration between LP (EER = 0.41) and NLP (EER = 0.26) conditions. Equivalent changes in rearward displacement (R×D) were observed with no significant differences between conditions for technique assessments 1, 2, or 3 (p = .13 - .67). Both NLP and LP conditions were found to primarily demonstrate 'sub-optimal' type 3 barbell trajectories (NLP = 72%; LP = 54%). These results suggest that MI instructions prescribing a specific movement form (i.e., LP condition) are ineffective in restricting available movements to a prescribed technique but rather the inherent task constraints appear to 'force' learners to explore alternative movement solutions to achieve successful performance outcomes. Although MI instructions prescribing specific techniques have previously supported improved skill development, the current findings indicate that learners may self-organise their movements regardless of MI instructions to satisfy individual and task constraints while achieving improved performance. Therefore, it may be beneficial to consider scripts that are more outcome focused and incorporate task constraints to facilitate learners' inherent exploration of individual task solutions.",

Transcranial electrical stimulation has also demonstrated to improve patient motor and non-motor performance. However, mixed findings from motor imagery studies that involved transcranial electrical stimulation suggest that current experimental protocols can be further improved towards a unified design for consistent and effective results. This paper aims to review, with some clinical and neuroscientific findings from literature as support, studies of motor imagery coupled with different types of transcranial electrical stimulation and their experiments onhealthy and patient subjects. This review also includes the cognitive domains of working memory, attention, and fatigue, which are important for designing consistent and effective therapy protocols. Finally, we propose a theoretical all-inclusive framework that synergizes the three cognitive domains with motor imagery and transcranial electrical stimulation for patient rehabilitation, which holds promise of benefiting patients suffering from neuromuscular and cognitive disorders."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, motor imagery has been proposed as a treatment modality for stroke owing to its feasibility in patients with severe motor impairment. Motor imagery-based interventions can be categorized as open- or closed-loop. Closed-loop intervention is based on voluntary motor imagery and induced peripheral sensory afferent (e.g., Brain Computer Interface (BCI)-based interventions). Meanwhile, open-loop interventions include methods without voluntary motor imagery or sensory afferent. Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) is defined as a significant temporal correlated signal among functionally related brain regions without any stimulus. rs-FC is a powerful tool for exploring the baseline characteristics of brain connectivity. Previous studies reported changes in rs-FC after motor imagery interventions. Systematic reviews also reported the effects of motor imagery-based interventions at the behavioral level. This study aimed to review and describe the relationship between the improvement in motor function and changes in rs-FC after motor imagery in patients with stroke. REVIEW PROCESS: The literature review was based on Arksey and O'Malley's framework. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched up to September 30, 2023. The included studies covered the following topics: illusion without voluntary action, motor imagery, action imitation, and BCI-based interventions. The correlation between rs-FC and motor function before and after the intervention was analyzed. After screening by two independent researchers, 13 studies on BCI-based intervention, motor imagery intervention, and kinesthetic illusion induced by visual stimulation therapy were included. CONCLUSION: All studies relating to motor imagery in this review reported improvement in motor function post-intervention. Furthermore, all those studies demonstrated a significant relationship between the change in motor function and rs-FC (e.g., sensorimotor network and parietal cortex).",

Motor imagery training (MIT), as an emerging rehabilitative intervention, can activate neural basis similar to that in actual exercise, so as to promote motor function in older adults. The complex motor skills rely on the functional integration of the cerebral cortex. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying motor imagery in older adults would support its application in motor rehabilitation and slowing cognitive decline. Based on this, the present study used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record the changes in oxygen saturation in older adults (20 participants; mean age, 64.8 ± 4.5 years) during Baduanjin motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI). ME significantly activated the left postcentral gyrus, while the oxy-hemoglobin concentration in the right middle temporal gyrus increased significantly during motor imagery. These results indicate that advanced ME activates brain regions related to sensorimotor function, and MI increases the activation of the frontal-parietal cortex related to vision. In older adults, MI overactivated the temporo-parietal region associated with vision, and tend to be activated in the right brain.",

METHODS: One hundred eligible stroke patients were randomly divided into a control group and trial group. The control group was given routine rehabilitation therapy, while the trial group was given routine rehabilitation therapy and trunk training using motor imagery. RESULTS: Prior to treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05) in Sheikh's trunk control ability, Berg rating scale (BBS), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), movement length, movement area, average front-rear movement speed, average left-right movement speed, and surface electromyography (sEMG) signal of the bilateral erector spinae and rectus abdominis. After treatment, Sheikh's trunk control ability, FMA, and BBS in the two groups were significantly higher than those before treatment (P < 0.05). The movement length, movement area, the average front-rear movement speed, and the average left-right movement speed in the two groups decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The differences of these indicators between the two groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). After treatment, the rectus abdominis and erector spinae on the affected side of the two groups improved when compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05). The rectus abdominis and erector spinae on the healthy side of the trial group descended after treatment (P < 0.05), while little changes were observed on the healthy side of the control group after treatment (P > 0.05). The rectus abdominis and erector spinae on the affected side of the trial group improved when compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the decline of abdominalis rectus and erector spinal muscle on the healthy side. CONCLUSION: Trunk training using motor imagery can significantly improve the trunk control ability and balance function of stroke patients and is conducive to promoting the recovery of motor function."

      "abstract": "The use of neurofeedback is an important aspect of effective motor rehabilitation as it offers real-time sensory information to promote neuroplasticity. However, there is still limited knowledge about how the brain's functional networks reorganize in response to such feedback. To address this gap, this study investigates the reorganization of the brain network during motor imagery tasks when subject to visual stimulation or visual-electrotactile stimulation feedback. This study can provide healthcare professionals with a deeper understanding of the changes in the brain network and help develop successful treatment approaches for brain-computer interface-based motor rehabilitation applications. We examine individual edges, nodes, and the entire network, and use the minimum spanning tree algorithm to construct a brain network representation using a functional connectivity matrix. Furthermore, graph analysis is used to detect significant features in the brain network that might arise in response to the feedback. Additionally, we investigate the power distribution of brain activation patterns using power spectral analysis and evaluate the motor imagery performance based on the classification accuracy. The results showed that the visual and visual-electrotactile stimulation feedback induced subject-specific changes in brain activation patterns and network reorganization in the [Formula: see text] band. Thus, the visual-electrotactile stimulation feedback significantly improved the integration of information flow between brain regions associated with motor-related commands and higher-level cognitive functions, while reducing cognitive workload in the sensory areas of the brain and promoting positive emotions. Despite these promising results, neither neurofeedback modality resulted in a significant improvement in classification accuracy, compared with the absence of feedback. These findings indicate that multimodal neurofeedback can modulate imagery-mediated rehabilitation by enhancing motor-cognitive communication and reducing cognitive effort. In future interventions, incorporating this technique to ease cognitive demands for participants could be crucial for maintaining their motivation to engage in rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Three-phase graded motor imagery (limb laterality, explicit motor imagery, and mirror therapy) has been successful in chronic pain populations. However, when applied to phantom limb pain, an amputation-related pain, investigations often use mirror therapy alone. We aimed to explore evidence for graded motor imagery and its phases to treat phantom limb pain. DATA SOURCES: A scoping review was conducted following the JBI Manual of Synthesis and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Thirteen databases, registers, and websites were searched. REVIEW METHODS: Published works on any date prior to the search (August 2023) were included that involved one or more graded motor imagery phases for participants ages 18+ with amputation and phantom limb pain. Extracted data included study characteristics, participant demographics, treatment characteristics, and outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty-one works were included representing 19 countries. Most were uncontrolled studies (31%). Many participants were male (75%) and had unilateral amputations (90%) of varying levels, causes, and duration. Most works examined one treatment phase (92%), most often mirror therapy (84%). Few works (3%) reported three-phase intervention. Dosing was inconsistent across studies. The most measured outcome was pain intensity (95%). CONCLUSION: Despite the success of three-phase graded motor imagery in other pain populations, phantom limb pain research focuses on mirror therapy, largely ignoring other phases. Participant demographics varied, making comparisons difficult. Future work should evaluate graded motor imagery effects and indicators of patient success. The represented countries indicate that graded motor imagery phases are implemented internationally, so future work could have a widespread impact.",

Second, determining what prior balance factors can affect the motor adaptation task. Methods: A double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed. Forty-eight healthy subjects were recruited. The balance of all participants during gait and standing was assessed before adapting to the complex, multi-limb motor task of riding an inverse steering bicycle (ISB). Two interventions were carried out interleaved among trials of adaptation to the motor task: the experimental group (n = 24) was asked to perform neuromodulation (EN) by watching first-person ISB riding through immersive VR glasses and, simultaneously, mentally mimicking the movements. The control group (CG) was asked to watch a slideshow video of steady landscape images. Results: The results showed that the EN group did not improve the motor adaptation rate and induced higher adaptation times with respect to the CG. However, while the motor adaptation success showed a significant dependence on the prior proprioceptive participation in balance in the CG, the EN group did not present any relationship between the prior balance profile and motor adaptation outcome. Conclusions: Results point to a benefit of the visually guided neuromodulation for the motor adaptation of the subjects with low participation of proprioception in balance. Moreover, the results from the control group would allow to disclose prognostic factors about the success of the motor adaptation, and also prescription criteria for the proposed neuromodulation based on the balance profile.",

Maximal hip abduction isometric torque, electromyography amplitudes (trained and untrained limbs), handgrip strength, right shoulder abduction (strength and electromyography), and imagery capability were measured before and after the intervention. Post intervention, motor imagery groups of both studies exhibited significant increase in hip abductors strength (∼8%, trained side) and improved imagery capability. Further results showed that imagery training induced bilateral transfer effects on muscle strength and electromyography amplitude of hip abductors. Motor imagery training was effective in creating functional improvements in limb muscles of trained and untrained sides."

      "abstract": "The rehabilitation effect of patients with moderate or severe upper limb motor dysfunction after stroke is poor, which has been the focus of research owing to the difficulties encountered. Brain-computer interface (BCI) represents a hot frontier technology in brain neuroscience research. It refers to the direct conversion of the sensory perception, imagery, cognition, and thinking of users or subjects into actions, without reliance on peripheral nerves or muscles, to establish direct communication and control channels between the brain and external devices. Motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) is the most common clinical application of rehabilitation as a non-invasive means of rehabilitation. Previous clinical studies have confirmed that MI-BCI positively improves motor dysfunction in patients after stroke. However, there is a lack of clinical operation demonstration. To that end, this study describes in detail the treatment of MI-BCI for patients with moderate and severe upper limb dysfunction after stroke and shows the intervention effect of MI-BCI through clinical function evaluation and brain function evaluation results, thereby providing ideas and references for clinical rehabilitation application and mechanism research.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, learning and motor control researchers have examined, in diverse ways, the practical strategies that enhance motor skill acquisition in sport. In this study we investigated the impact of combining Motor Imagery (MI), Feedback (F), and Action Observation (AO) on the quality of archery longbow shooting at a 10-meter target. We randomly assigned 60 young athletes to (a) a Control group (Control), (b) a Feedback and Motor Imagery group (F + MI), and (c) a Feedback, Motor Imagery, and Action Observation group (F + MI + AO). Over an 8-week intervention period athletes performed two training sessions per week. During each session, all participants engaged in two blocks of ten effective shots. Performance improvement was significantly greater in the F + MI + AO group than in the two other groups, confirming the beneficial impact of combining all three methods of improving archery accuracy. These findings suggest practical recommendations for athletes and trainers for delivering optimal mental training to improve shooting accuracy for these archers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We reported a 24-year-old woman who sustained multiple upper limb injuries after a traffic accident in March 2017. She sustained a C7-T1 brachial plexus injury and radial nerve injury on the left side diagnosed in November 2017. The patient underwent radial nerve reconstruction. The patient began her comprehensive therapy program in January 2018. PURPOSE: To describe the use of graded motor imagery (GMI) and outcomes after traumatic brachial plexus palsy. We presented changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity of target muscles during task execution and functional status following 10-session GMI therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: The program included 4 sessions of motor imagery and 6 sessions of a combination of motor imagery and mirror therapy. RESULTS: The patient successfully participated in the program with reported improvements in EMG activity, functional status, emotional well-being, and body awareness. CONCLUSIONS: GMI therapy appears to have peripheral motor effects, including altered surface EMG activity and contributes to a favorable outcome in the functional level of the affected arm. An improved emotional state and awareness of the affected hand could have a positive effect on function. Future long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the cumulative peripheral effects of treatment of graded motor imagery and the effects of variables mediating its effects on functional performance in patients with nerve injury.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Action observation plus motor imagery (AOMI) and somatosensory discrimination training (SSDT) represent sensory input-based approaches to train the motor system without necessarily asking subjects to perform active movements. PURPOSE: To investigate AOMI and SSDT effects compared to no intervention on manual dexterity in healthy subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. METHODS: Sixty healthy right-handed participants were randomized into AOMI, SSDT or Control (CTRL) groups. AOMI observed video-clips including right-hand dexterity tasks and concurrently performed motor imagery, SSDT performed surfaces recognition and 2-point distance discrimination tasks with the right hand, whereas CTRL underwent no intervention. A blinded physiotherapist assessed participants for manual dexterity using the Purdue Pegboard Test (Right hand-R, Left hand-L, Both hands-B, R+L+B and assembly tasks) at baseline (T0) and training end (T1). A mixed-design Analysis of Variance with Time as within-subject factor and Group as between-subject factor was used to investigate between-group differences over time. RESULTS: A Time by Group interaction and Time effect were found for R task, which increased from T0 to T1 in all groups with very large effect sizes for SSDT (d = 1.8, CI95 2.4-1.0, P < .001) and AOMI (d = 1.7, CI95 2.5-1.0, P < .001) and medium effect size for CTRL (d = 0.6, CI95 1.2-0.2, P < .001). Between-group post-hoc comparison for deltas (T1-T0) showed large effect size (d = 1.0, CI95 1.6-0.3, P = .003) in favor of SSDT and medium effect size (d = 0.7, CI95 1.4-0.1, P = .026) in favor of AOMI compared to CTRL. Time effects were found for L, B, R + L + B and assembly tasks (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: AOMI and SSDT induced greater manual dexterity improvements than no intervention. These findings supported the role of visual and somatosensory stimuli in building a motor plan and enhancing the accuracy of hand movements. These non-motor approaches may enhance motor performance in job or hobbies requiring marked manual dexterity.",
