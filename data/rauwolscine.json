      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Glaucoma is the main cause of blindness in the developed countries. Its progress can be diminished by decreasing intraocular pressure (IOP) using pharmacological or surgical treatment. Antiglaucoma agents, alpha 2-adrenergic's receptor agonists have been known for several years as IOP lowering. Due to the fact that the majority of them turned out to be imidazoline receptor agonists, it is worth checking if selective imidazoline receptor (l1) agonists alter IOP. Preliminary animal experiments show that they lower IOP. In our study we examined the influence of rilmenidine, a potent l1 receptor agonist, on IOP in rabbits. Furthermore, we tried to find out whether l1 and alpha 2 receptor antagonists (efaroxan and rauwolscine) counteract the pharmacological effect of rilmenidine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted on adult male White New Zealand rabbits. All the substances were administered topically, and IOP was measured by applanation tonometry after topical anaesthesia before and 1, 3 and 5 hours after drug instillation. RESULTS: Rilmenidine showed the lowering effect on IOP at the concentration of 0.4%. Efaroxan and rauwolscine partly inhibited rilmenidine effect. CONCLUSIONS: Rilmenidine is a potential antiglaucoma agent, though further studies are necessary.",

      "abstract": "Desipramine, like most antidepressants, does not exert clinical benefit until 2-3 weeks after the onset of treatment. It has been suggested that this delay might be due to enhanced autoreceptor activation, counteracting the acute uptake blockade. We therefore tested whether autoreceptor blockade might enhance the response to acute uptake blockade, using voltammetry at carbon fibre microelectrodes to monitor stimulated noradrenaline (NA) efflux in rat bed nucleus of stria terminalis brain slices. Desipramine significantly increased NA efflux and slowed NA uptake. The combination of rauwolscine and desipramine increased NA efflux significantly more than desipramine alone. We suggest that alpha 2 autoreceptor blockade functionally mimics alpha 2 autoreceptor down-regulation and thus may allow the full therapeutic effect of desipramine to be manifested more rapidly.",

      "abstract": "The adrenergic antagonists [3H]prazosin and [3H] rauwolscine were used to identify alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors respectively in the ovine myometrium. Ewes were allocated to four groups according to steroid hormone treatments or physiological status, namely ovariectomized ewes either as untreated controls, treated with oestradiol-17 beta or progestagen plus oestradiol-17 beta, and pregnant ewes at mid-gestation. Binding of both [3H]prazosin and [3H]rauwolscine to membrane preparations from the ovine myometrium was saturable, of high affinity and rapidly reversed by phentolamine (10 mumol/l). Based on the relative order of potency of selected adrenergic agonists and antagonists, the myometrial binding sites labelled by [3H]prazosin and [3H]rauwolscine were characterized as alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors respectively. Saturation binding studies with [3H]prazosin showed that the number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors was low (maximal binding capacity, Bmax, between 19 and 24 fmol/mg protein) and there were no noticeable differences between the animal groups. Moreover, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) did not vary significantly between groups (Kd between 0.10 and 0.17 nmol/l). In contrast, saturation binding studies with [3H]rauwolscine revealed the presence of a high number of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Values of Bmax were far higher in the pregnant ewes (1096 +/- 241 fmol/mg protein; means +/- S.D.) than in any of the non-pregnant ovariectomized ewes. For these latter groups, the highest Bmax values were found in the group treated with both progestagen and oestrogen (382 +/- 77 fmol/mg protein) compared with treatment with oestrogen alone (101 +/- 8 fmol/mg protein) or with controls (82 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the in vivo beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic properties of urapidil, a new antihypertensive alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent. In dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital, the cardioaccelerator nerve was isolated, decentralized and stimulated electrically to elicit adrenergically mediated increases in heart rate. Dobutamine was administered (3-30 micrograms/kg i.v.) to elicit increases in heart rate by the direct stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Urapidil 2 mg/kg i.v. had no significant effect on cardioaccelerator nerve-induced tachycardia, but 5 mg/kg i.v. decreased the response by 27%. Heart rate responses to dobutamine were suppressed slightly by the low dose of urapidil and to a greater degree by the high dose of urapidil, whereas the pressor response to dobutamine was markedly attenuated at both dose levels. Neurally or dobutamine-elicited tachycardia remaining after urapidil treatment was eliminated by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). When the selective alpha 2-antagonist rauwolscine was administered (1000 micrograms/kg i.v.), tachycardic responses to nerve stimulation increased 49% above control, and urapidil (5 mg/kg) given subsequently, caused a 48% reduction in the response. These data indicate that urapidil has weak beta 1-blocking activity more clearly seen after blockade of alpha 2-adrenoceptors.",

      "abstract": "alpha 2-Adrenoceptors located presynaptically on nerve terminals are known to modulate the release of neurotransmitters from noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurons. The pre- and/or postsynaptic localization of binding sites for alpha 2-adrenergic radioligands, the agonist 3H-clonidine and the antagonist 3H-rauwolscine, was investigated in the rat cerebral cortex by the use of specific neurotoxins. Intracerebroventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA) and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) were used to destroy the noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurons, respectively, and the success of the treatment was controlled by measurement of tritium accumulation in cortex slices incubated with 3H-noradrenaline or 3H-serotonin. In cortical membranes, 3H-rauwolscine bound to a single site (KD about 5 nmol/l; Bmax 217-247 fmoles/mg protein), whereas 3H-clonidine bound to a high affinity site (KD 0.6-1.4 nmol/l) and a low affinity site (KD 6-10 nmol/l). The total number of high plus low affinity 3H-clonidine binding sites was about two thirds of the number of 3H-rauwolscine binding sites. 6-OH-DA treatment significantly increased the number of high affinity 3H-clonidine binding sites without reducing the number of high plus low affinity binding sites, indicating a denervation supersensitivity. KD- as well as Bmax-values for 3H-rauwolscine remained unaltered after 6-OH-DA-treatment. Since an increase in postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors due to 6-OH-DA-administration might have masked a loss of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic binding sites, rats were chronically treated with high doses of clonidine in order to prevent a possible supersensitivity of postsynaptic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The central alpha-adrenoceptors responsible for mediating the clonidine-induced central hypotension in anaesthetized cats and sedation in mice have been characterized according to their sensitivities to the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine and its two diastereomeric congeners rauwolscine and corynanthine. Yohimbine and rauwolscine (1-10 microgram/kg) dose-dependently antagonized the central hypotensive response to clonidine (1 microgram/kg) applied 15 min later. Greater amounts of corynanthine (30-100 micrograms/kg) had to be administered to diminish the central depressor effect of clonidine. In these studies the drugs were infused via the left vertebral artery. The prolongation of the hexobarbitone-induced loss of the righting reflex in mice by clonidine (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) was inhibited by previous treatment with yohimbine and rauwolscine (0.04-5 mg/kg, i.p.) in a dose-dependent manner, but not by corynanthine. Binding experiments with rat isolated cerebral membranes demonstrated the higher affinity of yohimbine and rauwolscine for the [3H] clonidine- than for the [3H]prazosin-specific binding sites. The reverse was found for corynanthine. The relative potencies of yohimbine, rauwolscine and corynanthine in inhibiting these central effects of clonidine are comparable to their order of efficacies in blocking peripheral alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Accordingly, clonidine-induced central hypotension and sedation are mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors.",
