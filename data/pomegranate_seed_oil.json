      "abstract": "Aim: This study sought to clarify the therapeutic benefits and mechanisms of action of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) in instances of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) damage in the lower extremities. Materials and Methods: The sample size was determined, then 32 rats were randomly allocated to four groups: Control (C), ischemia-reperfusion (IR), low-dose PSO (IR + LD, 0.15 mL/kg), and high-dose PSO (IR + HD, 0.30 mL/kg). The ischemia model in the IR group was established by occluding the infrarenal aorta for 120 min. Prior to reperfusion, PSO was delivered to the IR + LD and IR + HD groups at doses of 0.15 mL/kg and 0.30 mL/kg, respectively, followed by a 120 min reperfusion period. Subsequently, blood and tissue specimens were obtained. Statistical investigation was executed utilizing Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 (SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results: Biochemical tests revealed significant variations in total antioxidant level (TAS), total oxidant level (TOS), and the oxidative stress index (OSI) across the groups (p < 0.0001). The IR group had elevated TOS and OSI levels, whereas PSO therapy resulted in a reduction in these values (p < 0.05). As opposed to the IR group, TASs were higher in the PSO-treated groups. Histopathological analysis demonstrated muscle fiber degeneration, interstitial edema, and the infiltration of cells associated with inflammation in the IR group, with analogous results noted in the PSO treatment groups. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expressions of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB), cytochrome C (CYT C), and caspase 3 (CASP3) were elevated in the IR group, while PSO treatment diminished these markers and attenuated inflammation and apoptosis (p < 0.05). The findings demonstrate that PSO has a dose-dependent impact on IR injury. Discussion: This research indicates that PSO has significant protective benefits against IR injury in the lower extremities. PSO mitigated tissue damage and maintained mitochondrial integrity by addressing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptotic pathways. Particularly, high-dose PSO yielded more substantial enhancements in these processes and exhibited outcomes most comparable to the control group in biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical investigations. These findings underscore the potential of PSO as an efficacious natural treatment agent for IR injury. Nevertheless, additional research is required to articulate this definitively.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of mushrooms containing α-Amanitin (α-A) can lead to severe liver damage. In this study, toxicological experiments were conducted to confirm the protective effects of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) and black cumin oil (BCO) against α-A-induced hepatotoxicity. Rats exposed once to α-A (3 mg/kg bw, i.p.) or saline alone (0.1 ml, i.p.) were either left untreated or treated with PSO or BCO at a dose of 2 ml/kg bw/day by oral gavage on the same day, and the treatment was continued for 7 days. Serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total protein levels were measured and the active caspase 3 (cl-caspase 3) was evaluated by western blotting in the liver. Serum ALT, AST and ALP levels tended to decrease in the α-A exposed group, but no statistically significant difference was found compared to the saline group (p > 0.05). PSO and BCO did not affect serum liver function tests in rats exposed to saline or α-A. α-A toxicity was demonstrated by a significant decrease in serum total protein level (p < 0.05), a significant increase in liver cl-caspase 3 expression (p < 0.05), and structural liver damage mainly characterized by mononuclear inflammation and steatosis. When α-A exposed rats were treated with BCO, the increase in cl-caspase 3 was not inhibited, on the contrary BCO increased cl-caspase 3 in healthy rats (p < 0.05). PSO significantly ameliorated α-A-induced cl-caspase 3 increase and inflammatory histopathology in the liver. Both PSO and BCO completely prevented α-A-induced protein degradation. The findings indicate that PSO and BCO may protect liver functions against α-A-induced hepatotoxicity, encouraging future comprehensive studies to test them at different doses and frequency.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate how dietary modifications with pomegranate seed oil (PSO) and bitter melon aqueous extract (BME) affect mineral content in the spleen of rats both under normal physiological conditions and with coexisting mammary tumorigenesis. The diet of Sprague-Dawley female rats was supplemented either with PSO or with BME, or with a combination for 21 weeks. A chemical carcinogen (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene) was applied intragastrically to induce mammary tumors. In the spleen of rats, the selected elements were determined with a quadrupole mass spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma ionization (ICP-MS). ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in elemental composition among experimental groups. Multivariate statistical methods were used to discover whether some subtle dependencies exist between experimental factors and thus influence the element content. Experimental factors affected the splenic levels of macroelements, except for potassium. Both diet modification and the cancerogenic process resulted in significant changes in the content of Fe, Se, Co, Cr, Ni, Al, Sr, Pb, Cd, B, and Tl in rat spleen. Chemometric analysis revealed the greatest impact of the ongoing carcinogenic process on the mineral composition of the spleen. The obtained results may contribute to a better understanding of peripheral immune organ functioning, especially during the neoplastic process, and thus may help develop anticancer prevention and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Multifunctional delivery systems capable of modulating drug release and exerting adjunctive pharmacological activity have attracted particular attention. Chitosan (CS) and pomegranate seed oil (PO) appear to be attractive bioactive components framing the strategy of complex therapy and multifunctional drug carriers. This research is aimed at evaluating the potential of CS in combination with PO in studies on topical emulgels containing hydrocortisone as a model anti-inflammatory agent. Its particular goal was to distinguish alterations in anti-inflammatory action followed with drug dissolution or penetrative behavior between the designed formulations that differ in CS/PO weight ratio. All formulations favored hydrocortisone release with up to a two-fold increase in the drug dissolution rate within first 5 h as compared to conventional topical preparations. The clear effect of CS/PO on the emulgel biological performance was observed, and CS was found to be prerequisite for the modulation of hydrocortisone absorption and accumulation. In turn, a greater amount of PO played the predominant role in the inhibition of hyaluronidase activity and enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of preparation E-3. Emulgels showed a negligible reduction in mouse fibroblasts' L929 cell viability, confirming their non-irritancy with skin cells. Overall, the designed formulation with a CS/PO ratio of 6:4 appeared to be the most promising topical carrier for the effective treatment of inflammatory skin diseases among the tested subjects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a growing interest, supported by many experimental and clinical studies, about the benefits of pomegranate in preventing various pathologic conditions, including brain neurodegeneration. The pomegranate seed oil (PSO) contains high levels of fatty acids that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. OBJECTIVE: Due to the lack of clinical trials, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of PSO on cognition of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Eighty people with the diagnosis of MCI were randomized forty to take 5 drops of PSO and follow the Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) and forty just followed MeDi. All were examined with an extensive neuropsychological assessment before and after one year of treatment. RESULTS: The results showed that the participants who took the PSO had statistically significantly better global cognition (p = 0.004), verbal episodic memory (p = 0.009), and processing and executive functions (p < 0.001) in contrast with the participants who did not take it. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the PSO can be beneficial for people with MCI as it is helpful for some important cognitive domains. As PSO is a natural product that does not burden the human body, it can be used by people with MCI and be a significant and promising part of holistic approaches for the prevention of dementia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a common disease with a high mortality. Decreasing the speed is possible with early and intensive therapy. However, most medicines have been tested, but none has proven effective. Therefore, the study aimed to discover the protective and therapeutic effects of pomegranate seed oil (PSO). METHODS: The cecal ligation puncture (CLP) method was used to induce sepsis. The experimental procedure was started with the animals divided haphazardly into four groups: control (C), sepsis (CLP), CLP + low dose PSO (CLP + LD), and CLP + high dose PSO (CLP + HD). First, the cecum was filled with feces. The full cecum was tied under the ileocecal valve for ligation and punctured. At 1 hour after CLP, 0.32 mg/kg and 0.64 mg/kg of PSO were administered. 24 hours after, lung and kidney specimens were collected. RESULTS: Neutrophil infiltration/aggregation and alveolar wall thickness decreased in lung with PSO groups compared with the CLP. The findings for overall lung injury were similar. In renal, all parameters were increased in the CLP compared with C, except for vascular vacuolization and hypertrophy. According to the CLP, all parameters were significantly lower in CLP + HD. Furthermore, glomerular vacuolization, degeneration, and necrosis of tubular cell, dilatation of bowman space, and tubular hyaline cylinders reduced CLP + LD versus CLP. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances decreased in lung, with the PSO groups. In addition, superoxide dismutase increased in PSO groups versus CLP. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the high-dose PSO is especially effective in treating sepsis.",

The various treatments for skin inflammation include medical and cosmetic creams, diet changes, and herbal therapy. In this study, we investigated the effects of Avocom-M and pomegranate seed oil extract (PSOE) against phenobarbital- and formaldehyde-induced skin biochemical changes in rats. We analyzed the constituents of PSOE using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. We also observed biochemical changes in the skin of human volunteers with and without TROSYD and PSOE as a skin cream. We compared the biochemical changes in human volunteers' skin before treatment and 21 days after the treatment stopped. The outcomes showed an improvement in the rats' biochemical status, due to PSOE and Avocom-M treatment. The human volunteers treated with TROSYD and PSOE showed substantial amelioration of skin inflammation. PSOE, Avocom-M, and TROSYD produced beneficial effects by reducing the levels of cyclooxygenase-2, lipid peroxidation, tyrosinase, hyaluronidase, elastase, collagenase, and nitric oxide in the animals tested on and in human volunteers.",

      "abstract": "Pomegranate seed oil with its high levels of phenolic compounds is known to exhibit neuroprotective effects. Delivering hydrophilic drugs to the brain is challenging since blood-brain barrier allows only a few lipophilic molecules into the brain, thus posing an additional barrier for drug delivery to the brain in conditions like Alzheimer's. The present study focuses on the preparation of the stable galantamine hydrobromide (GHBr) microemulsion (ME) using pomegranate seed oil (PSO) as an adjuvant. The developed ME was characterized for various physicochemical properties, cytotoxicity, and protective role against Amyloid Beta (1-42) oligomer-induced toxicity in IMR 32 cell line. GHBr and PSO ratio was optimized based on an in-vitro diffusion study and compatibility study using DSC and FTIR. The ME was prepared by the water titration method and optimized using the one variable at a time (OVAT) strategy. Globule size and PDI of GHBr PSO ME were found to be 200.36 ± 0.01 nm, and 0.219 ± 0.011 nm respectively. GHBr PSO ME showed significantly better results in terms of cell line toxicity, antioxidant activity and protective effect against Aβ induced cell death. The results obtained showed the potential of using PSO as an effective synergistic agent along with the anti-Alzheimer's drug for the treatment of disease.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder in women. Today, medicinal plants have been considered by women, especially in the reproductive and pregnancy ages. Multiple drug treatments and the length of the treatment period often lead to incomplete treatment by patients. Therefore, due to the side effects of chemical drugs, this study was conducted to assess investigate the effect of pomegranate seed oil on polycystic ovary syndrome. The prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome is increasing by 15 to 20% and clinically includes oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, and often infertility. Databases such as Cochran library, Medline, PubMed, SID, and Science Direct were used to access the related articles. To collect the required information, first, the articles that had one of the keywords of medicinal plants, polycystic ovary syndrome, plant, pomegranate extract, and menstrual irregularities in their text were searched in databases. All studies from 1985 to 2021 are included in the study. Conjugated linolenic acid (CLN) is a group of geometric and positional isomers of linolenic acid in which double bonds are conjugated. CLN has been reported to have a very strong cytotoxic effect on tissue tumor cells in the body, preventing cancer, reducing the accumulation of triacylglycerol in the liver, polycystic ovary syndrome, and LDL cholesterol in the blood. So far, seven CLN isomers have been identified, including ponic acid in pomegranate seed oil. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a group of situational and geometric isomers of linoleic acid in which double bonds are conjugated. The positive effects of the two main CLA isomers (cis-9, trans-11, and trans-10, cis-12) include inhibiting the growth of cancer, reducing the risk of atherosclerosis, and reducing body fat.",

The Eudragit RS 100® nanocapsules (PSONC) were prepared by the interfacial precipitation of preformed polymer, whereas the films were produced by the solvent casting method. Pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsions (PSONE) were prepared by the spontaneous emulsification method for comparative reasons. Both nanosystems presented adequate mean diameter (248 ± 16 nm for PSONE and 181 ± 6 nm for PSONC), polydispersity index (below 0.2), zeta potential (-25.63 ± 1.1 mV for PSONE and + 43.13 ± 0.7 mV for PSONC) and pH in the acid range (6.77 ± 0.27 and 5.31 ± 0.17, PSONE and PSONC). By a pre-formulation study, sorbitol (6.5%) and PEG 400 (1.5%) were considered the most suitable plasticizers for developing pullulan films (6%) intending topical application. In general, pullulan films were classified as flexible and hydrophilic, with high occlusive properties, 57.6 ± 0.8%, 64.6 ± 0.8% for vehicle, PSONCF (pullulan film containing PSONC), respectively. All formulations (films and nanocarriers) presented no irritant potential in the chorioallantoic membrane test. In the in vivo model, the treatments with free PSO and PSONCF attenuated the skin injury as well as the mechanical hypernociceptive behavioral induced by DNCB exposure to mice. Importantly, the biochemical analyses provided evidence that only the treatment with PSONCF modulated the inflammatory and the oxidative stress parameters evaluated in this study. In conclusion, these data lead us to believe that PSONC incorporation into a pullulan film matrix improved the biological properties of the PSO in this AD-model.",

Six different wounds 1 cm apart from the midline and each other were formed with a 6 mm punch biopsy instrument. Three wounds were left open (open wound group) whereas 3 wounds were sutured with 4/0 vicryl (closed wound group). Punica granatum seed oil treatment was administered topically to the treatment group, both to open and closed wounds, once a day for 14 days. Parameters for healing were evaluated. Histopathologic examination was performed for the investigation of inflammation, neovascularization, granulation, and fibroblast generation in addition to serologic (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) evaluation of rat malondialchehyche, rat glutathione peroxidase, and rat superoxide dismutase. PeriScan PIM 3 System Laser Doppler Blood Perfusion Imager was used for the calculation of blood perfusion. There was a statistically significant difference between inflammation and neovascularization levels and group type on the 14th day in open wounds(P < .05). On the 21st day, the granulation tissue level in the closed wound group was found to be higher in the pomegranate group (P = 0.000).The results showed that PSE oil is partially effective, although it is not effective in every parameter examined, in the treatment of excised wounds in rats and may be suitable for clinical treatment in humans but large controlled studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Though often neglected, cognitive impairment is a common feature of multiple sclerosis in 43-70% of patients. None of the novel MS treatment seems to substantially affect or restore cognitive disability in MS. GranaGard (Granalix Bio Technologies LTD) is a food supplement shown to prevent neuronal death in several animal models of neurological diseases. Capsules of GranaGard comprise a self-emulsion nano formulation of pomegranate seed oil (PSO). This oil contains 80-90% of Punicic Acid (PA), one of the strongest natural antioxidants. In animal experiments, administration of GranaGard results in conjugation with linoleic acid (CLA), the main metabolite of PA, which is a well-known neuroprotective agent. AIMS: To investigate whether GranaGard administration has an effect on the cognitive state of MS patients. METHODS: This is a single center, randomized double blind clinical trial that started in May 2018. The study included 30 MS patients; half of them (Group-A) were given GranaGard for the first three months and then placebo pills containing soybean oil for additional three months. Patients in Group-B received placebo for the first three months, and GranaGard for the following three months. GranaGard was administrated in addition to their immunomodulatory MS-treatments. Subsequently, all patients received GranaGard for additional six months. Patients were required to visit the neurologist at baseline (inclusion, visit 1) and at 3 months after treatment-initiation at each cycle of the trial (visits 2 and 3). During the follow up visits, clinical and cognitive examinations were performed, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC: 25 ft walking test, 9 PEG hole test & PASAT). Cognitive tests included The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) battery: 1) Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT); 2) California Verbal Learning Test - Second Edition (CVLT-II); 3) and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised (BVMT-R). Cognitive outcomes were normalized to the healthy population and expressed as z-scores, depended on age, gender and education. Short quality of life and fatigue questionnaires (SF-12, MFIS-5) were also provided by the participants. RESULTS: No serious adverse effects, related to the product, were observed during the study period. All patients receiving GranaGard reported a ''positive'' effect in their ADL while using the product. While there were no significant differences in the clinical parameters of disability (EDSS scores) between the treatment groups, there was a trend of beneficial effect of GranaGard, on the verbal testing during the first 3-month period of treatment. The z score for CVLT-II, significantly increased (from 0.891 to 1.415, p = 0.012, Wilcoxon rank test) at 3-months in the group of patients who were treated with GranaGard, as compared to baseline. A similar (but not statistically significant) trend was seen also in the BVMTr testing during the same 3 months-period, whereas there was no change in the SDMT. The overall average z-score of all three cognitive functions was significantly improved in the three months of Granagard treatment (-0.0077 at 3 months vs 0.462 at baseline, p = 0.034, Wilcoxon rank test). During the same 3-months period there were no significant changes in the placebo-treated group. For the patients receiving GranaGard in the initial 3 months, the value of z score of CVLT-II remained high (z = 1.415) also at the following three months (while they received placebo), suggesting a longer lasting effect for at least 3 months after discontinuation of the drug. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in which GranaGard, a brain targeted nano-formulation of PSO, was tested in humans. Our results in this small pilot, controlled trial provide indications that GranaGard administration to MS patients might improve/stabilize cognitive disability. Larger studies with longer duration, are needed to confirm these initial observations.",

No significant differences were observed between treatments for hens' performance, egg weight and yolk weight. In contrast, dietary ALA and PunA resulted in a significant increase in n-3 PUFA, rumenic acid (RmA) and PunA contents in egg yolk, as well as in the liver, heart, muscle and adipose tissue of the hens. Other conjugated dienes resulting from the metabolism of PunA or RmA also accumulated in the egg yolk and tissues. Unlike DHA, which was exclusively distributed in phospholipids, ALA, RmA and PunA were preferably distributed in triglycerides."

In this study, we investigated whether the dietary supplementation of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) exerted a protective effect on liver lipid uptake, fibrosis, and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of obesity and insulin resistance. METHOD: In this in vivo study, eight-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were fed with a high fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks and then were divided into three groups as follows: group (1) Lean; group (n = 6) (2) HF diet; group (n = 6) (3) HF diet treated with PSO (40 mL/kg food) (n = 6) for eight additional weeks starting at 24 weeks. Physiological parameters, lipid droplet accumulation, inflammatory biomarkers, antioxidant biomarkers, mitochondrial biogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic fibrosis were determined to examine whether PSO intervention prevents obesity-associated metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: The PSO group displayed an increase in oxygen consumption, as well as a decrease in fasting glucose and blood pressure (p < 0.05) when compared to the HFD-fed mice group. PSO increased both the activity and expression of hepatic HO-1, downregulated inflammatory adipokines, and decreased hepatic fibrosis. PSO increased the levels of thermogenic genes, mitochondrial signaling, and lipid metabolism through increases in Mfn2, OPA-1, PRDM 16, and PGC1α. Furthermore, PSO upregulated obesity-mediated hepatic insulin receptor phosphorylation Tyr-972, p-IRB tyr1146, and pAMPK, thereby decreasing insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that PSO decreased obesity-mediated insulin resistance and the progression of hepatic fibrosis through an improved liver signaling, as manifested by increased insulin receptor phosphorylation and thermogenic genes. Furthermore, our findings indicate a potential therapeutic role for PSO in the prevention of obesity-associated NAFLD, NASH, and other metabolic disorders.",

Sixteen fatty acids were identified in PSO. WPI treatment was considered the best formulation since it presented the highest fatty acid retention (68.51, 65.47, 47.27, 53.68, 52.95, and 52.28% for linoleic, oleic, punicic, α-eleostearic, catalpic, and β-eleostearic acids after 30 days-storage, respectively) and protected the oil against volatile compound formation (heptanal, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, (Z)-2-heptenal, octanal, pentanal, (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-octenal, nonanal, (E)-2-decenal, and (E,E)-2,4-octadienal), which did not occur with free PSO. Overall, encapsulation protected PSO against oxidation over time, which may allow the development of new functional foods.",

Group 1; Sham Operation, Group 2; Ischemia, Group 3; Ischemia + Reperfusion, Group 4; Ischemia + Pomegranate 0,32 ml / kg (IP), Group 5; Ischemia + Pomegranate 0.64 ml / kg, Group 6; Ischemia + Pomegranate 0,32 ml / kg + reperfusion, Group 7; Ischemia + Pomegranate 0,64 ml / kg + reperfusion. Three hours after ischemia and 3 hours after reperfusion, the study was terminated. RESULTS: While NADPH oxidase activity, MDA and TNF-α levels were significantly increased, SOD activity and GSH levels were reduced in ischemia and I/R groups. Low dose pomegranate seed oil application reduced significantly oxidative stress and NADPH oxidase activity in both ischemic and ischemic/reperfusion groups. At the same time, low-dose pomegranate seed oil extract reduced TNF-α levels and significantly increased antioxidant activity. CONCLUSION: PSO demonstrated an important therapeutic effect in the treatment of ovarian ischemia and reperfusion injury."

Due to the unexpected adverse effects of antidiabetic medicines, the use of nutraceuticals as a complementary therapy has drawn extensive attention by investigators. In this issue, a novel nutraceutical, Punicic acid (PA)-the main ingredient of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) that has potential therapeutic effects in T2DM-has been investigated. PA is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, and unlike synthetic ligands, such as thiazolidinediones, it has no side effects. PA exerts antidiabetic effects via various mechanisms, such as reducing inflammatory cytokines, modulating glucose homeostasis, and antioxidant properties. In this review, we discussed the potential therapeutic effects of PSO and PA and represented the related mechanisms involved in the management of T2DM.",

      "abstract": "The objective was to assess the influence of pomegranate seed oil supplementation on the quality of fresh, cooled and frozen-thawed Arabian breed stallion semen. Eight stallions (n = 4 per group) received their normal diet (control group) or normal diet top dressed with 200 ml of pomegranate seed oil (PSO group). Semen was collected every fifteen days for 90 days. Stallions were reversed across the treatments after a sixty-day interval. In cooled and stored condition (2, 12 and 24 hr), spermatozoa motion characteristics, membrane integrity, viability, morphology and lipid peroxidation were analysed. In frozen-thawed semen, sperm dynamic characteristics were analysed by CASA, acrosome status and mitochondrial activity (evaluated by Flow cytometry) determined. The effects of treatment, time, semen type and their interactions were submitted to PROCMIX (SAS® ), and means compared by the Tukey test. Also, collected semen samples were artificially inseminated to evaluate fertility and pregnancy rate after day 60 of the experiment. The results from fresh condition showed that semen volume, sperm concentration, abnormality and live sperm were not affected by dietary treatment (p > 0.05). In cooled condition, the higher value for sperm plasma membrane integrity and viability was observed in PSO group compared to control after 24 hr cooled and stored in 5°C. In postthawed condition, the higher value for CASA total motility and acrosome status was observed in PSO group compared to control group (p < 0.05). One hundred and twenty-six mares were artificially inseminated for fertility trial using control and PSO groups' fresh semen. The average pregnancy rates were not significantly different between control and treated group (62.88% and 65.90%, respectively) (p > 0.05). We concluded that under the conditions of this study, dietary supplementation of 200 ml pomegranate seed oil seems to relatively improved Arabian horse sperm quality during storage in cooled and frozen condition via increasing plasma membrane integrity, viability and acrosome status, but did not improve the pregnancy rates.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Postmenopausal osteoporosis is mostly caused by increased bone remodeling resulting from estrogen deficiency. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used to prevent osteoporosis, but it increases the risk for breast cancer, thromboembolism, strokes, and heart attacks. Pomegranate seed oil extract (SOE) is rich in phytoestrogen and antioxidant compounds. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the therapeutic role of SOE against bone turnover, resorption and osteoporosis induced in ovariectomized rats as a postmenopausal model and comparing the results with those from Generic CycloProgynova drug (D). DESIGN: The study used western albino rats undergo bilaterally ovariectomization as a model for postmenopausal. SETTING: The study took part in a laboratory setting. ANIMALS: Forty female western albino rats (age: 3-4 months) weighing 150-180 gm. MEASUREMENTS: Rats were divided into four groups, 10 rats each; SC-group: Sham control = untreated and unovariectomized rats; OVX-group = ovariectomized rats; (OVX-SOE) and (OVX-D) groups = OVX rats were treated with SOE and D, respectively. Bone markers (BMs) especially osteocalcin (BGP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tartarate resistance acid phosphatase (TRAcP), bone weight, bone calcium concentration, serum electrolytes (calcium, sodium and potassium) and serum estradiol (E2) level and histopathological examination of bones were determined. Also lipid profile, uric acid, prothrombin time (INR) and liver and kidney functions were measured to evaluate the adverse effects of SOE and D. RESULTS: In OVX group the activities of ALP and TRAcP and the levels of BGP, serum calcium, sodium and body weight were significantly higher (p≤0.05) than SC-group, while bone calcium concentration, bone mass, serum E2 and potassium level as well as uterus mass were significantly lower (p≤0.05). Also histopathological results revealed that the outer cortical bone became thinner, while the cancellous bone trabeculae lost their normal architecture. Moreover in OVX group lipid profile and uric acid levels were significantly higher (p≤0.05) than SC group, but there were no significant changes (p≤0.05) in INR level, liver and kidney functions. Treatment of OVX rats with SOE or D for 12 weeks improved both the architecture of bones as shown from the histopathological results and BMs, serum electrolytes and E2 levels (p≤0.05) which approached SC-group. Moreover after treatment of OVX rats with SOE the levels of lipid profile and uric acid were improved and approached SC-group, while liver function became significant lower (p≤0.05) than SC-group. Also there were no significant changes (p≤0.05) in kidney functions and INR of (OVX-SOE), OVX and SC groups. In contrast in (OVX-D) group the levels of lipid profile, liver and kidney functions, uric acid and INR were significantly higher (p≤0.05) than those of OVX and SC groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that SOE has therapeutic effects on osteoporosis, while it has no adverse effects on lipid profile, uric acid, liver and kidney functions when compared to HRT. SOE offers a promising alternative in the design of new strategies in nutritional management of age-related bone complications.",

      "abstract": "Peak bone mass (PBM) achieved at adulthood is a strong determinant of future onset of osteoporosis, and maximizing it is one of the strategies to combat the disease. Recently, pomegranate seed oil (PSO) has been shown to have bone-sparing effect in ovariectomized mice. However, its effect on growing skeleton and its molecular mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of PSO on PBM in growing rats and associated mechanism of action. PSO was given at various doses to 21-day-old growing rats for 90 days by oral gavage. The changes in bone parameters were assessed by micro-computed tomography and histology. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to analyze the levels of serum insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1). Western blotting from bone and liver tissues was done. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to study the histone acetylation levels at IGF-1 gene. The results of the study show that PSO treatment significantly increases bone length, bone formation rate, biomechanical parameters, bone mineral density and bone microarchitecture along with enhancing muscle and brown fat mass. This effect was due to the increased serum levels of IGF-1 and stimulation of its signaling in the bones. Studies focusing on acetylation of histones in the liver, the major site of IGF-1 synthesis, showed enrichment of acetylated H3K9 and H3K14 at IGF-1 gene promoter and body. Further, the increased acetylation at H3K9 and H3K14 was associated with a reduced HDAC1 protein level. Together, our data suggest that PSO promotes the PBM achievement via increased IGF-1 expression in liver and IGF-1 signaling in bone.",

The present study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of Pomegranate Seed Oil (PSO) on diabetes-induced changes in oxidant/antioxidant balance of the kidney, heart and mitochondria from rats and H9c2 cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In these in vivo and in vitro studies, male rats were divided into four groups (twelve each): group 1 served as control, group 2-4 received a single dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.p), groups 3 and 4 received PSO (0.36 and 0.72 mg/kg/daily, gavage), respectively. After three weeks, six rats of each group and one week later the remaining animals were anaesthetized and the hearts and kidneys were removed and homogenized. Mitochondrial fractions were separated and enzyme activities were measured in each sample. H9c2 cells were pretreated with high levels of glucose (35 mM), and then, incubated with PSO. Finally, cell viability test, reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation were evaluated. RESULTS: Significant reduction in enzymes activity (Superoxide dismutase, Glutathione S-transferase and Paraoxonase 1), compensatory elevation in Glutathione Reductase, Glutathione Peroxidase and Catalase activity followed by reduction after one week and significant elevation in Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) were observed in diabetic group. PSO treatment resulted in a significant increase in enzymes activity and decreased OSI values compared to diabetic group in both tissue and mitochondrial fractions. PSO remarkably decreased glucose-induced toxicity, ROS level and lipid peroxidation in H9c2 cells. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that PSO has a protective effect against diabetes-induced alterations in oxidant/antioxidant balance in tissues, mitochondrial and H9c2 cell line."

New data determined that the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus is chronic low-grade inflammation, resulting insulin resistance. Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) has anti-inflammatory effects; though it may reduce insulin resistance and improve glycemia in diabetes mellitus. The present study has been designed to investigate the effects of PSO as a natural dietary component on metabolic state of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind clinical trial study, 80 patients (28 men) with Type 2 diabetes were randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group consumed PSO capsules, containing 1000 mg PSO twice daily (2000 mg PSO), whereas controls take placebo for 8 weeks. The participants followed their previous dietary patterns and medication use. Dietary factors and metabolic factors including lipid profile, fasting plasma sugar, and insulin and were assayed at the baseline and after 8 weeks. RESULTS: Participants in two intervention and control group were similar regarding anthropometric and the dietary factors at baseline and after trial (P > 0.05). Mean level of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein was not different significantly between groups after trial (P > 0.05). Consumption of PSO did not significantly affect the levels of parameters such as fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, HbA1c, alanine transferase, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of 2000mg PSO per day for 8 weeks had no effect on FBS, insulin resistance and lipid profile in diabetic patients."

Sections of heart and kidneys were used for histopathological studies and the remaining tissues were homogenized for measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and total sulfhydryl groups. RESULTS: Significant elevation of serum creatinine and urea, LDL, triglyceride, glucose levels as well as urine markers, MDA levels in tissue homogenates and a significant decrease in total thiol content and serum HDL were observed in STZ-treated group as compared with control group. PSO treatment resulted in a significant decrease in tissue MDA content, serum creatinine and urea levels as well as urine markers as compared with STZ-treated group. Lipid profile was ameliorated with PSO treatment. PSO also significantly reversed STZ-induced depletion in thiol content and histological abnormality. Effect of PSO was more specific at 28th than 21th days of study. CONCLUSION: The results showed that PSO has a protective effect against diabetes complications in rats.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Glioma is a malignant brain tumor with rapid proliferation, infiltrative growth, poor prognosis and it is chemoresistent. Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. This study showed the optimization of PSO nanoemulsions (NEs) as an alternative for glioma treatment. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate PSO NEs cytotoxicity on human blood cells and antiglioma effects against C6 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NEs were prepared by the spontaneous emulsification method, using PSO at 1.5 and 3.0%, and were evaluated regarding their physical stability and antioxidant activity. Toxicity evaluations in human blood cells were performed in terms of cell viability, genotoxicity, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, catalase activity and hemolysis at 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL PSO, after a 72-h incubation period. In vitro antitumor effect was determined against glioma cells after 24 and 48 h, and astrocytes were used as a non-transformed cell model. RESULTS: Formulations presented droplet size below 250 nm, low polydispersity index, negative zeta potential and pH in the acid range. NEs and PSO had scavenging capacity around 30% and promoted a proliferative effect in mononuclear cells, increasing about 50% cell viability. No genotoxic and oxidative damage was observed in lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation and catalase activity evaluations for NEs. Hemolysis study showed a hemolytic effect at high concentrations. Moreover, formulations reduced only tumor cell viability to 47%, approximately. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Formulations are adequate and safe for intravenous administration. Besides, in vitro antitumor activity indicates that NEs are promising for glioma treatment.",

The formulations showed adequate characteristics and improved ketoprofen's photostability against UVC radiation exposure. The dialysis bag technique showed that 100% of the drug was released from the nanoemulsions after 3h and the oil amount had no influence on the releasing. Furthermore, time- and dose-response curves were obtained to determine the antinociceptive effect of the formulations. In the post-test, the nanoemulsion containing ketoprofen significantly reduced abdominal constrictions in time-response curve, showing effect up to 12h while the free ketoprofen showed effect up to 3h. In addition, the blank nanoemulsion presented a reduction of abdominal constriction up to 1h of pre-treatment. Regarding the dose-response curve, the free ketoprofen presents effect at 0.5mg/Kg dose and nanoemulsion at 1.0mg/Kg dose. Time- and dose-response curves were performed to determine the antinociceptive effect in inflammatory pain. After the evaluation of mechanical allodynia testing at the Von Frey Hair, the free ketoprofen showed effect up to 6h while nanoemulsions presented effect up to 10h. Moreover, acute toxicity was performed with ALT and AST activity evaluations and urea levels. After 7 days of treatment, no toxic effects for nanoemulsions were found. In conclusion, ketoprofen-loaded pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsions presented adequate characteristics and a high antinociceptive activity in the animal models tested.",

The separation of plasma phospholipids was carried out on an Acquity U-HPLC BEH C18 column (2.1mm×50mm, 1.7μm, Waters) by linear gradient elution using a mobile phase consisting of 10mM ammonium formate in water and acetonitrile: isopropanol (1:1, v/v) mixed solution added by 0.25% water and 10mM ammonium formate. The method demonstrated a good precision and reproducibility. Linear regression analysis showed a good linearity. And potential biomarkers were discovered based on their mass spectra and chemometrics methods. The results demonstrated that the proposed U-HPLC/Q-TOF-MS method was successfully applied to analyze the dynamic changes of phospholipids components in plasma of T2DM mice after drug treatment and could provide a useful data base for meriting further study in humans and investigating pharmacological actions of drugs.",

Nanoemulsions were able to delay the photodegradation profile of ketoprofen under UVC radiation, regardless of the concentration of pullulan. In vitro release study indicates that nanoemulsions were able to release approximately 95.0% of ketoprofen in 5h. Free ketoprofen and formulations were considered hemocompatible at 1 μg/mL, in a hemolysis study, for intravenous administration. In addition, a formulation containing the highest concentration of pullulan was tested against C6 cell line and demonstrated significant activity, and did not reduce fibroblasts viability.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seed oils are used as cosmetics or topical treatment for wounds, allergy, dandruff, and other purposes. Natural antioxidants from plants were recently reported to delay the onset or progress of various neurodegenerative conditions. Over one thousand cultivars of Punica granatum (Punicaceae) are known and some are traditionally used to treat various ailments. AIM: The effect of pomegranate oil on 3-nitropropionic acid- (3-NP) induced cytotoxicity in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) neuronal cells was analyzed in this study. Furthermore, the analysis of unsaturated fatty acid composition of the seed oil of pomegranate by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was done. RESULTS: GC-MS study showed the presence of 6,9-octadecadiynoic acid (C18:2(6,9)) as a major component (60%) as 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivative. The total extractable oil with light petroleum ether by Soxhlet from the dry seed of P. granatum was 4-6%. The oil analyzed for 48.90 ± 1.50 mg gallic acid equivalents/g of oil, and demonstrated radical-scavenging-linked antioxidant activities in various in vitro assays like the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl, % IP = 35.2 ± 0.9%), ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), % IP 2.2 ± 0.1%), and β-carotene bleaching assay (% IP = 26 ± 3%), respectively, which could be due the possible role of one methylene interrupted diynoic acid system for its radical-scavenging/antioxidant properties of oil. The oil also reduced lipid peroxidation, suppressed reactive oxygen species, extracellular nitric oxide, lactate/pyruvate ratio, and lactase dehydrogenase generated by 3-NP- (100 mM) induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, and enhanced the levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants at 40 μg of gallic acid equivalents. CONCLUSION: The protective effect of pomegranate seed oil might be due to the ability of an oil to neutralize ROS or enhance the expression of antioxidant gene and the exact mechanism of action yet to be elucidated.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neurodegenerative diseases generate the accumulation of specific misfolded proteins, such as PrP(Sc) prions or A-beta in Alzheimer's diseases, and share common pathological features, like neuronal death and oxidative damage. To test whether reduced oxidation alters disease manifestation, we treated TgMHu2ME199K mice, modeling for genetic prion disease, with Nano-PSO, a nanodroplet formulation of pomegranate seed oil (PSO). PSO comprises large concentrations of a unique polyunsaturated fatty acid, Punicic acid, among the strongest natural antioxidants. Nano-PSO significantly delayed disease presentation when administered to asymptomatic TgMHu2ME199K mice and postponed disease aggravation in already sick mice. Analysis of brain samples revealed that Nano-PSO treatment did not decrease PrP(Sc) accumulation, but rather reduced lipid oxidation and neuronal loss, indicating a strong neuroprotective effect. We propose that Nano-PSO and alike formulations may be both beneficial and safe enough to be administered for long years to subjects at risk or to those already affected by neurodegenerative conditions. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: This team of authors report that a nanoformulation of pomegranade seed oil, containing high levels of a strong antioxidant, can delay disease onset in a mouse model of genetic prion diseases, and the formulation also indicates a direct neuroprotective effect.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of pomegranate seed oil (PGS) on menopausal symptoms. METHODS: The prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial was completed by 81 postmenopausal women, who received two daily doses of either 30 mg PGS containing 127 μg of steroidal phytoestrogens per dose or a placebo for 12 weeks. The participants reported their number of hot flashes and completed the Menopause Rating Scale II at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. At baseline and after 12 weeks, hormonal status was determined. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, PGS reduced the number of hot flashes per day by 4.3 (38.7%), whereas placebo reduced it by 2.5 (25.6%). Both groups were significant compared with baseline, but the treated group was not significant compared with the placebo group (P = 0.17). After 24 weeks, the treated group showed a mean of 7.1 (interquartile range, 4.0) hot flashes per day compared with the placebo group with a mean of 8.8 (interquartile range, 5.0; P = 0.02). Although the overall sum score of the Menopause Rating Scale II parameters at week 12 decreased in the treated group from 16.0 to 9.0 at week 12 and in the placebo group from 18.0 to 14.5 (P = 0.08), the sum score of the vegetative somatic symptoms subgroup decreased strongly versus placebo (P < 0.03), attributable mainly to an improvement in sleeping disorders. PGS did not affect the hormone status, and no adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women, PGS does not significantly reduce hot flashes within a 12-week observation period, but further studies are needed to investigate the long-term effect.",

      "abstract": "In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that punicic acid, a type of conjugated fatty acid and the main constituent of pomegranate seed oil (PSO), has anti-atherogenic effects. The present study aimed at determining the effect of PSO treatment on serum lipid profiles. This double-blind placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial included fifty-one hyperlipidaemic subjects, diagnosed according to National Cholesterol Education Program definition, and randomly assigned to the PSO and the control groups. The PSO and placebo groups received 400 mg PSO and placebo twice daily, respectively and were followed up for 4 weeks. Serum concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins were measured before and 4 weeks after intervention. Mean concentration of TAG and the TAG:HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio were significantly decreased after 4 weeks in the PSO group as compared with baseline values (2.75 (sd 1.40) v. 3.45 (sd 1.56) mmol/l, P = 0.009 and 5.7 (sd 4.6) v. 7.5 (sd 5.0), P = 0.031, respectively). The treatment effect was statistically significant in the PSO group as compared with controls in diminution of cholesterol:HDL-C ratio (5.4 (sd 1.5) v. 5.9 (sd 1.4), P < 0.05) adjusted for baseline values. We found a mean difference for PSO v. placebo in HDL-C concentration (0.13 v. - 0.02 mmol/l) and cholesterol:HDL-C ratio ( - 0.42 v. 0.01, P < 0.05). Serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and glucose concentrations and body composition variables remained unchanged. It is concluded that administration of PSO for 4 weeks in hyperlipidaemic subjects had favourable effects on lipid profiles including TAG and TAG:HDL-C ratio.",

      "abstract": "Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) seed oil (PGO) contains more than 70% cis(c)9,trans(t)11,c13-18:3 as conjugated linolenic acids (CLN). Our previous short-term experiment demonstrated that seed oil from bitter melon (Momordica charantia) (BMO), which is rich in c9,t11,t13-CLN, inhibited the occurrence of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) induced by azoxymethane (AOM). In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary PGO on the development of AOM-induced colonic malignancies and compared it with that of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). To induce colonic tumors, 6-week old male F344 rats were given subcutaneous injections of AOM (20 mg/kg body weight) once a week for 2 weeks. One week before the AOM treatment they were started on diet containing 0.01%, 0.1%, or 1% PGO or 1% CLA for 32 weeks. Upon termination of the bioassay (32 weeks) colon tumors were evaluated histopathologically. AOM exposure produced colonic adenocarcinoma with an incidence of 81% and multiplicity of 1.88 +/- 1.54 at week 32. Administration of PGO in the diet significantly inhibited the incidence (AOM + 0.01% PGO, 44%, P < 0.05; AOM + 0.1% PGO, 38%, P < 0.01; AOM + 1% PGO, 56%) and the multiplicity (AOM + 0.01% PGO, 0.56 +/- 0.73, P < 0.01; AOM + 0.1% PGO, 0.50 +/- 0.73, P < 0.005; AOM + 1% PGO, 0.88 +/- 0.96, P < 0.05) of colonic adenocarcinomas, although a clear dose-response relationship was not observed at these dose levels. CLA feeding also slightly, but not significantly, reduced the incidence and multiplicity of colonic adenocarcinomas. The inhibition of colonic tumors by PGO was associated with an increased content of CLA (c9,t11-18:2) in the lipid fraction of colonic mucosa and liver. Also, administration of PGO in the diet elevated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma protein in the non-tumor mucosa. These results suggest that PGO rich in c9,t11,c13-CLN can suppress AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis, and the inhibition is associated in part with the increased content of CLA in the colon and liver and/or increased expression of PPARgamma protein in the colon mucosa.",

      "abstract": "Pomegranate seed oil was investigated for possible skin cancer chemopreventive efficacy in mice. In the main experiment, two groups consisting each of 30, 4-5-week-old, female CD(1) mice were used. Both groups had skin cancer initiated with an initial topical exposure of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene and with biweekly promotion using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The experimental group was pretreated with 5% pomegranate seed oil prior to each TPA application. Tumor incidence, the number of mice containing at least one tumor, was 100% and 93%, and multiplicity, the average number of tumors per mouse, was 20.8 and 16.3 per mouse after 20 weeks of promotion in the control and pomegranate seed oil-treated groups, respectively (P <.05). In a second experiment, two groups each consisting of three CD(1) mice were used to assess the effect of pomegranate seed oil on TPA-stimulated ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, an important event in skin cancer promotion. Each group received a single topical application of TPA, with the experimental group receiving a topical treatment 1 h prior with 5% pomegranate seed oil. The mice were killed 5 h later, and ODC activity was assessed by radiometric method. The experimental group showed a 17% reduction in ODC activity. Pomegranate seed oil (5%) significantly decreased (P <.05) tumor incidence, multiplicity, and TPA-induced ODC activity. Overall, the results highlight the potential of pomegranate seed oil as a safe and effective chemopreventive agent against skin cancer.",
