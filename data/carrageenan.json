      "abstract": "Terephthalic acid (TPA) is widely used in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics and is one of PET's degraded products. However, TPA poses environmental health risks due to its persistence and potential toxicity, and thus, it is referred to as one of the major environmental pollutants. The present study describes the application of immobilized Rhodococcus erythropolis MTCC 3951 cells for TPA biodegradation to develop a viable bioprocess. Kappa carrageenan (KC) matrix was used to immobilize the cells. The entrapment conditions were modified for maximum TPA degradation and minimum cell leakage. The entrapped cells were cryofreeze at -20 °C for 24 h, followed by thawing at 24 °C for 4 h. Cryofreezing was introduced to enhance the cell's stability and mechanical strength, required for effective reusability. The stability of the matrix was confirmed by FTIR, TGA, and FESEM. The cryofreeze entrapped cells completely degrade 5 mM TPA within 14 h of treatment. The immobilized cells could be reused for at least 10 repeated cycles without loss in degradation efficiency. The cryofreezing of immobilized cells in KC is a novel technique to enhance the system's stability. The developed bioprocess could be used efficiently to alleviate TPA pollution from the environment."

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has a poor clinical prognosis, where conventional treatment offers therapeutic limitations. Therefore, the current study introduces a first-of-its-kind sorafenib (SOR) nanoemulsion (SNE) loaded with poloxamer-carrageenan nanoemulgel (SPCNEG), a novel dual-functional and natural polymer-based payload system for effective intranasal chemotherapeutic administration. The nanoformulation was developed using carrageenan (a natural gelling agent), poloxamer (a mucoadhesive agent), glyceryl caprate as lipid, and Cremophor EL:PEG 400 blend as surfactant system. The improved biopharmaceutical attributes of developed formulations were confirmed from the release experiments, revealing augmentation in drug release from SNE (84.56 ± 3.78 %) and SPCNEG (68.62 ± 4.11 %) up to 3.41- and 8.12-fold compared to plain SOR. The ex vivo experiments showed a similar enhancement in drug permeation. Moreover, the SNE also showed superior performance on glioma cell lines, as indicated by lower IC50 (2.23 μg/mL) than plain SOR (16.61 μg/mL). The pharmacokinetic study revealed a 2.52- and 3.24-fold increase in SNE and SPCNEG brain concentration, respectively, compared to Soranib®. Additionally, a high correlation was also observed between in vitro drug release and in vivo absorption at prespecified time intervals for developed formulations. In conclusion, the current research promising and non-invasive alternative to existing interventions for enhanced brain targeting potential."

      "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the combined effect of κ-carrageenan (KC, 0.2 %, w/w) coupled with different ultrasound (US) treatment duration times (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 min) on the gelling properties, sensory attributes and in vitro digestibility of frankfurters. The results indicated that the combination of US and KC exhibited effective outcomes in diminishing cooking loss and enhancing emulsion stability of frankfurters (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the 20-min US treatment combined with KC demonstrated optimal enhancement of the textural characteristics of frankfurters, accompanied by the development of a denser meat protein gel network as compared to the incorporation of KC alone. Furthermore, US treatment for 10-30 min significantly improved the interior colour, springiness and flavour intensity of frankfurters compared to control. Moreover, the primary molecular forces in frankfurters treated with US treatment and KC were hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds. In addition, US combined with KC compensated for the reduced in vitro digestibility of frankfurters caused by the addition of KC alone, mainly because the cavitation and mechanical oscillation effects induced by US promote the occurrence of hydrophobic groups of meat proteins and contribute to the binding of proteins to digestive enzymes. In conclusion, moderate US treatment (20 min) was identified as optimal, with extended treatment durations (40 and 50 min) leading to protein aggregation, which was detrimental to the quality of frankfurters."

      "abstract": "Sustainable water management is crucial for reducing environmental impact, improving public health, and contributing to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study introduces a novel hydrogel composite membrane for wastewater treatment and desalination. The membrane was fabricated by cross-linking kappa-carrageenan (κC) with nano-zerovalent iron (nZVI) using polyethyleneimine (PEI) to produce a porous structure hydrogel membrane of high water flux and contaminant rejection via adsorption and reduction processes, leveraging the properties of kappa carrageenan and nZVI. Experiments showed an increased water flux and rejection rate for the hydrogel membrane by increasing the pressure from 10 psi to 30 psi. In initial tests with 2 g/L of NaCl or MgSO4, the membrane exhibited 98 % rejection of divalent Mg2 + ions and 90 % rejection of Na+ ions at 30 psi and 17.98 L/M2H water flux. The hydrogel's contaminant separation mechanisms involve a combination of size exclusion, electrostatic repulsion, and hydrophilic-hydrophobic polarity rejection. Leachate wastewater treatment by the membrane achieved 11 L/m2h water flux at 30 psi and an outstanding rejection rate of more than 98 % for divalent ions, such as Li+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Co2+, and Cu2+, and 61 % rejection of organic matter of 165.68 mg/L initial concentration. Due to membrane fouling, the water flux decreased in the second and third filtration cycles, while membrane rejection remained unchanged. The dead-end filtration mode facilitated metal ions recovery at the end of the experiments, recording 68.32 % and 66.31 % recovery for lead and lithium ions. This novel hydrogel provides a promising and sustainable solution for water purification and valuable heavy metals recovery from solutions to support the circular economy."

      "abstract": "Food safety and security are now among the most urgent problems to be resolved as the world's population continues to grow. Intensive agriculture is required to meet the demands of a growing population and guarantee greater agricultural yield. Chemical pesticides and fertilizers are an essential part of intensive farming. Their extensive use accelerates the depletion of other important and minor nutrients, resulting in poor soil fertility and nutritional imbalance. There are serious health and environmental hazards associated with several of these hazardous agricultural chemicals. In context, for the first time, this study represents an innovative experiment exploring the impact of exogenously applied k-carrageenan on plant growth, physiological parameters, phytochemical content, macronutrients, and essential oil percentage in Ocimum basilicum plants. The investigation assessed the effect of varying k-carrageenan levels; 0.30, 0.60, 0.90, and 1.20 mM versus untreated control. The findings revealed that all k-carrageenan treatments significantly enhanced growth indicators compared to the control. The phytochemical analysis demonstrated that foliar application of k-carrageenan, particularly at 1.20 mM, significantly enhanced total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total carbohydrate and essential oil percentage compared to the untreated control. O. basilicum essential oils show rich, nuanced flavors with higher levels of Methyl cinnamate, Camphor, trans-methyl cinnamate, Eucalyptol, Linalool, and β-Caryophyllene among treatments. Treatment effects were also observed in the macroelements content of Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). k-carrageenan-induced alterations were noted in the contents of essential oil compounds. These results suggest that k-carrageenan can be a growth-promoting agent and significantly enhance essential oil yield, particularly in O. basilicum plants.",

Despite the prevailing emphasis on these aspects in their applications, the potential of iCOs as a prebiotic agent for gut health and its subsequent impact on intestinal disorders such as colitis remains largely unexplored. A DSS-induced colitis model was employed in C57BL/6 male mice to analyze the gut microbiota via 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to assess the therapeutic effects of iCOs on colitis. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) identified pathways and genes affected by iCOs. ELISA measured inflammatory cytokines, while western blot and RT-qPCR evaluated protein and gene expressions, respectively. The iCOs increased beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia. They enhanced short-chain fatty acid production and upregulated GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A mRNA, influencing cytokine secretion. The iCOs reduced mRNA of SPHK1, BDKRB1, LCN2, and so on, potentially through PI3K-Akt pathway inhibition, and promoted tight junction protein expression. Our findings highlight the novel therapeutic potential of iCOs in colitis, indicating a multifaceted approach to treatment that includes gut microbiota modulation, intestinal barrier restoration, and the suppression of inflammatory responses."

      "abstract": "Metal oxide nanoparticles synthesized via green routes are increasingly recognized for their potential in water treatment applications due to their enhanced photocatalytic properties. This study presents a novel approach for the synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using κ-carrageenan derived from alkali-treated Kappaphycus striatus (Katunay itum) as a capping agent during ZnO NP formation and as a source of nonmetal dopants, carbon, and sulfur. The resulting carrageenan-mediated ZnO NPs (car-ZnO NPs) were thoroughly characterized using physicochemical techniques to evaluate their morphological, optical, and chemical properties. The findings revealed that κ-carrageenan incorporation significantly reduced the band gaps and crystallite sizes of ZnO NPs. Specifically, the 0.75 car-ZnO NPs exhibited the most uniform particle size distribution and demonstrated superior photocatalytic efficiency in degrading methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) under UV light, outperforming unmodified ZnO NPs (0.00 car-ZnO). The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the narrowed band gap and effective doping with carbon and sulfur, which improved charge carrier separation and extended their lifetime. Additionally, car-ZnO NPs showed excellent photostability and high efficiency in repeated photocatalytic cycles, emphasizing their eco-friendly nature and practicality for water treatment. This study highlights the dual role of κ-carrageenan as a promising, sustainable material for synthesizing ZnO NPs with advanced photocatalytic properties, offering a green alternative for effective wastewater treatment and environmental remediation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: No animal models fully replicate the pathogenesis and clinical features of sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which hinders mechanistic understanding and treatment development. Kappa-carrageenan (KCG) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induce thrombosis and systemic inflammation in mice, respectively. The combination of LPS and KCG provides a promising method for establishing a mouse model of sepsis-associated DIC. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish a standardized mouse model of sepsis-associated DIC using KCG and LPS. METHODS: Kunming (KM) mice were intraperitoneally injected with KCG (25-200 mg/kg) alone or in combination with LPS (50-1250 μg/kg) to determine optimal dose. The effects of ambient temperature, gender and mouse strains on the mouse model were evaluated. Time-dependent changes in the model were examined. RESULTS: The combined injection of KCG (100 mg/kg) and LPS (50 μg/kg) effectively induced tail thrombosis and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. Mice housed at 16 ± 1℃ exhibited more severe thrombosis and hypocoagulability than those at 24 ± 1℃. Male and female mice exhibited similar responses. Time-course analysis revealed inflammation and blood hypocoagulability beginning from 1.5 to 24 h, with fibrinolysis inhibition occurring within 1 h. Tail thrombosis and auricle petechial developed at 3 and 6 h, respectively, and stabilized by 12 h. Thrombi in the tail, lung and liver along with organ dysfunction were obeserved at 12 h. KM and BALB/c mice exhibited longer tail thrombi than Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. KM mice showed more severe blood hypocoagulability than ICR and BALB/c mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a standardized mouse model of sepsis-associated DIC using KCG and LPS, which more accurately replicates the key clinical and pathological characteristics of sepsis-associated DIC compared to existing models. This model serves as a novelty and valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms of sepsis-associated DIC and therapeutic evaluation."

      "abstract": "Inflammation is a fundamental physiological reaction that leads to the development of many diseases, including tissue damage, asthma, diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. The enzyme COX is a vital mediator in inflammatory processes. Interestingly, the COX enzyme possesses multiple structural similarities to the carbonic anhydrase enzyme. SLC-0111, a molecule known for its potent and selective inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, has not yet been studied for its potential effects on acute inflammation, proinflammatory cytokine levels, or oxidative stress parameters. Our study seeks to assess the binding affinity of SLC-0111 to the COX enzyme, as well as its possible anti-inflammatory properties. We treated rats SLC-0111 at dosages of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for 3 days before generating inflammation with carrageenan (CAR). Following CAR delivery, paw thickness was evaluated at 4-h intervals to assess inflammatory levels. Additionally, protein extravasation in paw tissue has been examined using Evans Blue (EB) dye. MDA and glutathione (GSH) levels in paw tissue were measured to assess oxidative stress. Carrageenan enhanced edema, protein extravasation, and proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-13. SLC-0111 decreased all of these, except for IL-4. Similarly, the histological findings of our research indicated that SLC-0111 had an anti-inflammatory effect at a dose of 200 mg/kg. However, SLC-0111 had no significant effect on MDA or GSH levels. These data represent that SLC-0111 may have anti-inflammatory properties and could be used as a treatment for inflammation-related disorders.",

While various physiochemical and/or enzymatic approaches have been employed to enhance the cryoprotective efficacy of saccharides, potential synergistic effects between different saccharide candidates remain largely unexplored. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that the combinational use of β-cyclodextrin (CD) and carrageenan oligosaccharide (CGO) exhibit significant synergistic cryoprotective effects on surimi myofibrillar proteins (MP) during freeze-thaw cycles. At 1 wt% concentration, the CD-CGO complex exhibited significantly greater cryoprotective efficiency than the commercial surimi cryoprotectant (4 % sucrose with 4 % sorbitol). Specifically, the CD-CGO co-treatment mitigated surimi MP denaturation over six freeze-thaw cycles, as evidenced by increased solubility (2.17 times), Ca2+-ATPase activity (3.91 times), and sulfhydryl content (2.55 times), along with reduction in surface hydrophobicity (0.42 times). In addition, freezing-induced MP aggregation and conformational changes, e.g., α-helix loss and disulfide bond destabilization, were effectively inhibited. Consequently, MP treated with CD-CGO complex demonstrated more ordered microstructures, uniform water distribution, and significantly improved viscoelasticity and mechanical strengths. This study provides a novel synergistic paradigm to boost saccharide cryoprotection performance, which also exhibits the potentials to elevate the FT stability of MP gel products."

In this study, a new three-layer dressing was designed for the first time, specifically for pressure ulcers. Collagen/carrageenan sponge as a porous absorbent in the upper layer, reduces pressure and repairs the wound. Stearic acid was used in the middle layer to minimize adhesion, and gelatin and levofloxacin were electrospun to the middle layer to improve cell behavior and create bacteriostatic properties. Comparative evaluations showed that three-layer EI dressing achieved the highest wound closure and healing rate within 10 days and outperformed two-layer dressings. The three-layer dressing showed antibacterial activity, cell viability, and fluid retention. In addition, it showed excellent cell compatibility and homeostatic properties in a rat liver injury model. The presence of stearic acid in the three-layer dressing effectively prevents wound adhesion under pressure. The comprehensive findings of this study show that three-layer dressings act as a biological factor in bed wound management strategies and bring us closer to the fact that the healing of these wounds will have a smoother path and help countless people."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Jasminum humile is widely used in traditional medicines to treat hard lumps, mouth inflammation, ringworms, and other infections. Leaf decoction of the plant is known to be effective in treating various skin conditions. In addition, root juice is traditionally utilized as a remedy for ringworm infections. Studies have reported that J. humile contains various antioxidant metabolites with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, J. humile chloroform extract (JHC) was investigated for anti-inflammatory effects against carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rat models. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography was used to examine phenolic compounds present in JHC. The in-vivo anti-inflammatory activities were investigated using carrageenan-induced paw oedema rat models, while indomethacin was referred to as positive control. Therapeutic properties of JHC were examined by assessing paw volumes, motility score, and inflammatory proteins in serum. The anti-inflammatory nature of JHC was further investigated by biochemical and hematological profiles along with genetic expression of inflammatory and antioxidant genes through qRT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Indomethacin at 10 mg/kg and JHC at 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg doses decreased the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) while upregulating the concentration of albumin and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Moreover, JHC administration reduced the expression levels of inflammatory markers, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) compared to the Carr-treated control. However, a significant rise was induced in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) levels after JHC treatment as compared to Carr-treated rats. CONCLUSION: These results showed significant anti-inflammatory potential of J. humile by increasing the activity levels of enzymatic antioxidants and lowering inflammatory markers. These results confirm the beneficial use of natural plants in the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs.",

Here, we report the facile route for the fabrication of the bio-sourced pH-responsive hydrogels based on κ-carrageenan and gelatin, with properties desirable for the treatment of versatile skin disorders. The extensive characterization revealed differences in physicochemical properties due to chemical modifications of the hydrogels. Porosity ranged from 21.67% to 95.81%. By modifying κ-carrageenan hydrogels with gelatin, the Young's modulus values increased proportionally with the gelatin content, ranging from 0.23 to 2.90 MPa, while native κ-carrageenan hydrogels had the lowest values (0.12-0.42 MPa) and native gelatin hydrogels had the highest (10.85-18.03 MPa). Native κ-carrageenan hydrogels exhibited the most pronounced swelling (18.6-27.0), followed by gelatin-modified κ-carrageenan hydrogels (6.5-23.0) and native gelatin hydrogels (7.8-9.0). The native κ-carrageenan hydrogels also displayed the highest water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) (259.99 ± 16-279.91 ± 19 g m-2 day-1), while the presence of gelatin lowered it. The hydrogels were preliminary exposed to human fibroblasts (MRC-5 cell line) and then to Caenorhabditis elegans to reveal the effects on whole living organisms. The summarized results suggest that the hydrogels represent advantageous and versatile biocompatible biomaterials set for further investigation as delivery platforms for bioactive molecules suitable for skin tissue regeneration.",

Here, we present novel tumor-targeted, stimuli-responsive nanomicelles (D@CGO-G) through a straightforward supramolecular self-assembly method, incorporating targeting peptide GE11, doxorubicin (DOX), and a labile carrageenan (CG) linkage. Mechanistic insights into nanomicelles assembly process are thoroughly investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. D@CGO-G exhibit superior targeting capability both in vitro and in vivo, while the released DOX induces tumors apoptosis and ICD, stimulating macrophage polarization and enhancing the infiltration of tumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Furthermore, D@CGO-G effectively suppress both primary and distant tumors in vivo through combined apoptosis and anti-tumor immune responses. Our results highlight a simple, cost-effective approach to develop responsive CG-based nanomicelles for precise tumor targeting and robust multimodal therapeutic effects, advancing their clinical potential in cancer therapy."

This study investigates the inhibitory effects of 'Arnica montana extract hydrogel patch (AHP)' on Carrageenan-induced paw edema and hot plate-induced pain models. AHP exhibited transdermal permeability without the occurrence of issues like crystal precipitation. This study employed two animal model assessments using AHP, in comparison with Arnicare Gel (AG), to evaluate anti-inflammatory and pain relief effects. AHP treatment for 2 days showed a decrease in paw edema thickness in mice as compared to vehicle or AG groups; Carrageenan-induced swelling increased maximally at 1 h with the AHP group demonstrating a higher reduction. Thus, the AHP group exhibited a lower ratio of right/left paw thickness and a superior reduction in swelling, supportive of its ability to diminish edema. A histological analysis showed that AHP treatment reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. Consistently, the mRNA levels of inflammatory markers (tnfa, il1b, and il6) were decreased to a greater extent than the AG group. Particularly, tnfa inhibition was better in the AHP group, and the levels of il1b and il6 transcripts showed ~80% and 40% lower. Likewise, AHP reduced pain scores in a hot plate-induced rat model, although AG failed to do so. Together, these results demonstrate that AHP has long-lasting inhibitory effects on fluid effusion and edema formation, the production of inflammatory mediators, and pain-sensation, supporting its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving pharmacological effects."

GFP01, characterized by a molecular weight of 97.8 kDa, exhibits a linear backbone composed of 4-O-sulfated-β-D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-α-D-galactose. In a murine model subjected to PM2.5-induced high IOP, GFP01 treatment significantly mitigated IOP compared to the PM2.5 group (n = 12, p < 0.01). In vitro assays revealed a 27.7 % increase in cell viability in human trabecular meshwork cells (HTMCs) treated with GFP01 compared to controls exposed to PM2.5 (p < 0.001, n = 5 cell lines). Additionally, GFP01 decreased PM2.5-induced transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of angular aqueous plexus (AAP) cells by 35.8 % at 48 h post-treatment (p < 0.05, n = 3 cell lines). Western blot analysis further demonstrated GFP01's role in inhibiting NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD/IL-1β axis in ocular tissues and HTMCs. Cytotoxicity assessment and slit-lamp imaging confirmed the safety of GFP01. In conclusion, GFP01 demonstrates a significant protective effect against PM2.5-induced IOP elevation, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for clinical applications.",

To overcome these obstacles, oligosaccharide derivatives (λ-COS) have been successfully applied to the synthesis of stable NP incorporating both, ferrite cores and divalent manganese (Mn2+) releasable ions. The acute pro-inflammatory behavior and anticoagulant activity of native λ-CAR were significantly reduced in the case of λ-COS and λ-COS NP, rendering possible their use for medical applications. In vivo MRI studies in mice showed that the λ-COS NP framework is promising for two applications. The first is partial Mn2+ release into the plasma to achieve intracellular Mn2+-based contrast of the myocardium and imaging of the hepatobiliary system. Second, it serves as a novel sugar-based coating that confers suitable pharmacokinetic properties to NP, making it promising for further targeted therapy applications.",

      "abstract": "The present study aims to structurally and rheologically characterize the cold plasma-induced degradation product of κ-carrageenan and explore its application as a thaw stabilizer in plant-based patties. κ-CG was exposed to cold plasma of input voltage 170, 200, and 230 V for 10, 20, and 30 min, followed by characterization. Intrinsic viscosity reduced by ∼40 % at the extreme treatment condition of 230-30 which demonstrates depolymerization following a zeroth order kinetics. The depolymerized κ-CG was found with lower viscosity (∼639.51 Pa·s), elastic (G'-53.41 Pa), and viscous (G″-23.66 Pa) modulus compared to that of untreated one (1053.70 Pa·s; 171.26 Pa; 88.60 Pa respectively). The structural degradation affected the thermal stability of κ-CG indicated by a drop in melting point (from ∼54.21 °C to ∼41.11 °C). The 1H NMR and FT-IR revealed that the sulfate esters at the C-4 position of galactose-4-sulfate are substituted with hydroxyl groups thus desulfating the polysaccharide. These phenomena synergistically prevent aggregation of κ-CG to reduce syneresis of water from the κ-CG gels by almost ∼83.33 %. Cold plasma degraded κ-CG increased the thaw stability of plant patties with reduced hardness due to better water uptake capacity. This proves cold plasma is a prospective green modification technology for commercial polysaccharides.",

MCNF outperformed free κ-carrageenase in terms of optimal temperature, thermostability (45-55 °C), stability (pH 6.0 and 12.0), and storage stability. Furthermore, MCNF was extremely reusable and easy to separate from the reaction system. MCNF's enzymatic breakdown of κ-carrageenan resulted in a tetrasaccharide that competitively inhibited pancreatic lipase (PL). Fluorescence titration experiments showed that κ-carrageenan tetrasaccharide altered the microenvironment of PL by causing static bursting of its intrinsic fluorescence. The circular dichroism experiment demonstrated that adding κ-carrageenan tetrasaccharide reduced α-helix content and increased β-sheet content in PL's secondary structure. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation research suggested that the κ-carrageenan tetrasaccharide could form a stable complex with PL, entering its hydrophobic cavity and occupying its active site, reducing PL's catalytic activity. κ-Carrageenan tetrasaccharide could inhibit PL, making it a promising therapeutic agent for obesity prevention and treatment.",

Our results firstly found that only the combination of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) pre-treatment and dialysis could realize successful purification of OIC due to the strong electrostatic attractions between positive copper ions and negative sulphate ions. The introduction of copper ions could effectively speed up the oxidation of OIC, enhancing the content of aldehyde and carboxyl groups, resulting in the hydrolysis of the ether bonds in IC, inhibiting the detachment of sulphate, decreasing the molecular weight, thermal stability, characteristic temperature (i.e. gelling and melting temperature). It was worth mentioning that K+ and Zn2+ could also inhibit the de-sulfation during the oxidation via the chelating interactions. In addition, purified OIC samples possessed excellent cytocompatibility and blood compatibility, which could also promote the proliferation and migration of fibroblast cells. Meanwhile, all OIC samples possessed antibacterial activity. In summary, our investigations shed new lights on OIC synthesis, purification, properties and potential applications.",

Rats were injected with 3 % carrageenan into the masseter muscle. These rats exhibited acute and chronic hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli for 6 weeks after injection. Pre-treatment with meloxicam prevented carrageenan-induced chronic hypersensitivity. Furthermore, minocycline and dexamethasone, but not acetaminophen, suppressed carrageenan-induced hypersensitivity in the chronic phase. Microglial reactivity in the trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) was assessed by immunohistochemistry 3 days after treatment. The reactivity of microglial cells in the Vc was increased in carrageenan-treated rats compared with vehicle-injected rats. Meloxicam and dexamethasone, but not acetaminophen, prevented carrageenan-induced microglial hyperreactivity in the Vc. These results suggest that early prevention of peripheral/spinal inflammation suppresses microglial reactivity in the Vc and inhibits the development of orofacial chronic pain."

Hydrogels may represent a good tool to treat AD due to their high water content, making them excellent candidates for drug delivery vehicles in skin research. This work aimed to develop and characterize hybrid hydrogels composed of gel-forming polymers (k-carrageenan and polyvinyl alcohol) for cutaneous delivery of betamethasone (up to 0.2 mg mL-1) widely used to manage AD, with high skin retention. Bergamot oil and menthol essential oils were also incorporated into the hydrogels to study their effects on penetration and retention of the corticosteroid. Rheological properties revealed the pseudoplastic behavior of the hydrogels, a favorable characteristic for skin application. Cytocompatibility towards fibroblasts and keratinocytes was determined, revealing safe usage of the hydrogel blends up to 100 mg mL-1, corresponding to 20 µg mL-1 in betamethasone, but was compromised by the presence of the essential oils in the higher hydrogel tested concentrations (50 and 100 mg mL-1). The ex vivo pig ear skin permeation assay showed that hydrogels promote betamethasone retention up to 20 % of the added dose (c.a. 10 µg) even after 24 h of permeation, independently of the use of essential oils' use in the composition, showing that they might be a good strategy to treat AD skin.",

The results showed that particulate matter significantly increased the cellular levels of the pollutant metal ions, stimulated ROS production and cellular inflammatory response, and inhibited enzyme precursors for ceramide synthesis and interfered with lipid synthesis. In contrast, κ-carrageenan tetrasaccharide treatment can downregulate pro-inflammatory factors by chelating metal ions to reduce ROS levels and revert the action of PM on STAT3 and PI3K/AKT pathways and PPAR-γ expression. The beneficial roles of κ-carrageenan tetrasaccharide in protection of dehydration and inflammation suggest that it can be used as a cosmetic ingredient for skincare.",

In the present work, the preparation of novel PES membranes incorporated with carrageenan (CAR), which is a natural polymer derived from edible red seaweed, is reported for the first time. The PES/CAR membranes were prepared by using the nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) method at 0.1-4.0 wt.% CAR loadings in the casting solutions. The use of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which is a bio-based and low-toxic solvent, is reported. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, water contact angle, porosity, and zeta potential measurements were used to evaluate the surface morphology, structure, pore size, hydrophilicity, and surface charge of the prepared membranes. The filtration performance of PES/CAR membranes was tested with bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions. It was shown that CAR incorporation in the casting solutions notably increased hydrophilicity, porosity, pore size, surface charge, and fouling resistance of the prepared membranes compared with plain PES membranes due to the hydrophilic nature and pore-forming properties of CAR. The PES/CAR membranes showed a significant reduction in irreversible and total fouling during filtration of BSA solutions by 38% and 32%, respectively, an enhancement in the flux recovery ratio by 20-40%, and an improvement in mechanical properties by 1.5-fold when compared with plain PES membranes. The findings of the present study indicate that CAR can be used as a promising additive for the development of PES UF membranes with enhanced properties and performance for water treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown great promise as pH-responsive drug delivery systems, with considerable potential for targeted cancer therapy. In this study, we synthesized a novel curcumin-loaded MOF, named UWO-2 (CUR@UWO-2), and developed its biocomposite form, CS-κ-Cr/CUR@UWO-2, by coating it with chitosan (CS) and κ-carrageenan (κ-Cr). Structural analysis through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirmed the successful synthesis of UWO-2 and the incorporation of CUR within the MOF structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed two distinct peaks at approximately 1021.15 eV and 1044.23 eV, corresponding to the Zn 2p₃/₂ and Zn 2p₁/₂ states, respectively. These peaks confirm the presence of the expected Zn2+ oxidation state in UWO-2, further validating its successful synthesis. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in surface area (367.4 m2/g) and pore volume (0.296 cm3/g), validating the entrapment of CUR within the UWO-2 MOF structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that UWO-2 particles are spherical with a smooth surface, while CUR@UWO-2 exhibited a larger particle size, indicating successful curcumin loading. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated enhanced thermal stability due to CUR loading, while swelling experiments revealed increased water absorption at neutral pH, supporting effective drug release under physiological conditions. Biodegradation studies showed sustained degradation of CUR@UWO-2 in the presence of lysozyme, confirming its suitability for in-vivo applications. The drug delivery system achieved 21.9 % drug loading and 75.1 % encapsulation efficiency. Drug release experiments indicated accelerated release under acidic conditions, with the Korsmeyer-Peppas model identifying Fickian diffusion as the primary release mechanism. Cytotoxicity assessments showed increased cell death with CUR@UWO-2, enhanced by the synergistic effect of UWO-2, while the CS-κ-Cr coating enabled controlled, prolonged curcumin release. Confocal microscopy confirmed cellular uptake of CUR, underscoring the potential of the biocomposite for tumor-targeted chemotherapy applications in cancer treatment. This study highlights the potential of CUR@UWO-2, especially in its biocomposite form, for tumor-targeted drug delivery applications.",

      "abstract": "The discharge of oil-laden wastewater from industrial processes and the frequent occurrence of oil spills pose severe threats to the ecological environment and human health. Membrane materials with special wettability have garnered attention for their ability to achieve efficient oil-water separation by leveraging the differences in wettability at the oil-water interface. These materials are characterized by their simplicity, energy efficiency, environmental friendliness, and reusability. Among them, superhydrophilic-underwater superoleophobic membranes inspired by biomimetic fish scale structures have become a focal point of oil-water separation research due to their ability to repel oil contaminants effectively and maintain self-cleaning properties during the separation process. In this study, a stainless steel microporous two-dimensional metal mesh was employed as the substrate, coated with a carrageenan solution, and gelled in situ using sodium periodate as a crosslinking agent to fabricate a membrane with oil-water separation capabilities. The robust hydrophilicity of the carrageenan hydrogel imparts the coated stainless steel mesh with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity (underwater oil contact angle ≥ 158°), along with excellent antifouling properties and recyclability. Experimental results demonstrate that the membrane achieved separation efficiencies of 98.87%, 98.08%, 98.14%, and 97.98% for silicone oil, canola oil, cyclohexane, and liquid paraffin, respectively, with a water flux of 1380.75 L/m2·h. Remarkably, the membrane retained its initial separation efficiency even after 20 cycles. Additionally, the hydrogel exhibited exceptional stability under highly alkaline conditions, making it suitable for the treatment of complex oil-contaminated wastewater. PRACTITIONER POINTS: This study extracted a biocompatible and renewable hydrogel from marine red algae for application in oil-water separation. A superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic oil-water separation membrane was developed based on biomimetic fish scale structures. The membrane exhibited exceptionally high separation efficiency under pure gravity-driven conditions. The resulting material exhibits excellent oil repellency, self-cleaning capability, and recyclability.",

      "abstract": "To date, less attention has been paid to λ-carrageenases and their enzymatic hydrolysates than to κ- and ι-carrageenases and their hydrolysates. In this study, a Gram-negative strain Polaribacter sp. NJDZ03 was isolated from the surface of an Antarctic macroalga, Desmarestia sp., and a novel λ-carrageenase gene car3193 was isolated from it. The car3193 gene was 2832 bp long, and encoded an enzyme consisting of 943 amino acids. Although Car3193 had the typical PQQ structure at the N-terminal, its predicted active sites, Arg93 and Asn361, differed from those of other reported λ-carrageenases. The optimum temperature and pH of recombinant Car3193 towards λ-carrageenan were 50 °C and 7.0, respectively. The degradation products of λ-carrageenan produced by Car3193 were λ-neocarrabiose-, λ-neocarratetraose-, and λ-neocarraoctose-saccharides. Two products of enzymatic hydrolysis, λ-COs-1 (degree of polymerization 2; DP2) and λ-COS-2 (DP8), showed excellent anti-inflammatory activity towards lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. Treatment with λ-COs-1 (DP2) and λ-COS-2 (DP8) significantly inhibited the secretion of the pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and NO by RAW264.7 macrophages, and stimulated the secretion of the anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β1 and IL-10. The anti-inflammatory activity of λ-COs-1 was stronger than that of λ-COS-2, and λ-COs-1 had a dose-dependent bioactive effect, whereas λ-COS-2 did not. Further analyses showed that these carrageenan oligomers stimulated an anti-inflammatory response by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. Car3193 has potential applications in industry because of its high activity and strong stability, and its ability to generate bioactive products.",

The results indicate that SE treatment did not alter the species of carrageenan, but it significantly elevated the content of characteristic carrageenan groups, with the sulfate group content and 3,6-anhydrogalactose (3,6-AG) content increasing by 15.86% and 45.08%, respectively. The jellies prepared with κ-carrageenan following SE treatment demonstrated a more stable gel network structure, with an 80.9% increase in gel strength at a 1.5% κ-carrageenan concentration; the water precipitation rate of these jellies was minimized to 7.96 ± 0.69% when κ-carrageenan was added at a 1.7% concentration. These results suggest that SE treatment provides useful information for the application of κ-carrageenan in jelly."

The present work is the first attempt to utilize hydrogel-loaded carvacrol-based chemotherapy with fractionated photothermal therapy (F-PTT) using a 635 nm laser for its treatment. Gold nanobipyramids (AuNBPs) were used as drug carrier and photosensitizer. A marine-derived hydrogel (AuNBP-HG) was fabricated and physicochemically characterized. A 635 nm NIR light was used for the fractionated PTT in three cycles of treatment on different days at varying power densities for 5 min. The efficiency of single and dual treatments was experimented in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the dual therapy imparted a better effect than monotherapy. The AuNBP-CVL synthesized was nearly 50 nm and efficiently loaded within AuNBP-HG, displaying thermal responsiveness, a good sol-gel transition, a controlled drug release rate, and high stability. In vitro evaluation demonstrated that the F-PTT evinced stability during temperature rise without damaging healthy surrounding tissue. In vivo study revealed that a stable temperature rise up to 60 °C by the 635 nm NIR light due to photosensitization of AuNBP and sustained CVL release from AuNBP-HG into the tumor microenvironment exhibited successful thermal ablation of the cancer cells. Histological analysis confirmed that the uniform suspension of AuNBP within cancer tissues might have enhanced tumor cell lysis during the dual therapy. Western blot analysis exhibited that the cellular death could result from the upregulation of pJNK and p53 protein. In conclusion, the current study illustrated that dual therapy could be a feasible alternative to non-target specific and invasive traditional therapies against prostate cancer.",

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the protective effect of a sulfated iota-carrageenan isolated from the marine alga Solieria filiformis (IC-Sf) against naproxen-induced gastrointestinal injury. Methods: Parameters of gastrointestinal injury, secretory and motor functions, and toxicity were evaluated. Results: The results demonstrated that IC-Sf significantly reduced naproxen-induced gastrointestinal macroscopic injury, with a maximum effect observed at 30 mg/kg. IC-Sf also preserved gastrointestinal antioxidant defense and prevented lipid peroxidation, with a reduction in the non-protein sulfhydryl group (NP-SH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations induced by naproxen. Additionally, IC-Sf mitigated naproxen-induced gastrointestinal inflammation, as evidenced by reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). IC-Sf did not alter gastric secretion or gastrointestinal motility. In addition, the animals treated with IC-Sf did not present toxic effects. Conclusions: In conclusion, IC-Sf protected the gastrointestinal tract against the harmful effects of naproxen by inhibiting the inflammatory response and lipid peroxidation, suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic agent or food additive."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The potential impact of specific food additives, common in Western diets, on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is not well understood. This study focuses on carrageenan, a widely used food additive known to induce insulin resistance and gut inflammation in animal models, and its effects on human health. METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial conducted at a university hospital metabolic study centre, 20 males (age 27.4 ± 4.3 years, BMI 24.5 ± 2.5 kg/m2) participated. The intervention involved oral intake of carrageenan (250 mg) or placebo in the morning and in the evening and each intervention lasted 2 weeks. The primary outcome measured was insulin sensitivity (using oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp). Additional end-points included whole body and hepatic insulin sensitivity, MRI-measured brain inflammation and insulin resistance, intestinal permeability (via lactulose-mannitol test and plasma zonulin levels), and gut microbiome composition. Immune-cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. RESULTS: Overall insulin sensitivity did not show significant differences between the treatments. However, interactions between BMI and treatment were observed (OGTT-based insulin sensitivity index: p=0.04, fasting insulin resistance: p=0.01, hepatic insulin sensitivity index: p=0.04). In overweight participants, carrageenan exposure resulted in lower whole body and hepatic insulin sensitivity, a trend towards increased brain inflammation, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels compared to placebo. Additionally, carrageenan was associated with increased intestinal permeability. In vitro natural killer (NK-)cell activation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine release were found after carrageenan exposure in the participant's peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that carrageenan, a common food additive, may contribute to insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation in overweight individuals through pro-inflammatory mechanisms in the gut. Further investigation into the long-term health impacts of carrageenan and other food additives is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02629705.",

Kappaphycus alvarezii, predominantly cultivated in tropical countries, is the primary source of kappa-carrageenan. Traditional industrial extraction methods involve alkaline treatment for up to three hours followed by heating, which is inefficient and generates substantial waste. Thus, developing improved extraction techniques would be helpful for enhancing efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, solvent costs, energy consumption, and the required processing time. In this study, we explored innovative extraction methods, such as ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and supercritical water extraction (SFE), together with other extraction methods to produce kappa-carrageenan from a new strain of K. alvarezii from the Philippines. FTIR-ATR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the structure of the different carrageenan fractions. We also examined the physicochemical properties of isolated phycocolloids, including viscosity, and the content of fatty acids, proteins, and carbohydrates. For refined carrageenan (RC), both the traditional extraction method and the UAE method used 1 M NaOH. Additionally, UAE (8% KOH) was employed to produce semi-refined carrageenan (SRC). UAE (8% KOH) produced a high yield of carrageenan, in half the extraction time (extraction yield: 76.70 ± 1.44), and improved carrageenan viscosity (658.7 cP), making this technique highly promising for industrial scaling up. On the other hand, SFE also yielded a significant amount of carrageenan, but the resulting product had the lowest viscosity and an acidic pH, posing safety concerns as classified by the EFSA's re-evaluation of carrageenan as a food additive.",

      "abstract": "In order to solve the problem of poor adhesion of polysaccharide coatings in meat storage and inconvenient secondary spraying, which leads to poor preservation effect, this study was inspired by the property of mussels to adhere firmly to surfaces and design a bioactive composite coating. Here, curcumin-loaded zein nanoparticles (CZ NPs) were successfully prepared and incorporated into carrageenan-based biocomposite coatings for chilled meat preservation. The prepared curcumin-zein-riboflavin-carrageenan (CZRC) coating featured smooth spherical morphology and the solubility of hydrophobic substances, the adhesion and stability of the composite coating were respectively improved to 3.8 and 6 times compared to CZ NPs. The CZRC coating also shows desirable antioxidant activity (89.78 ± 4.8 % on DPPH and 91.40 ± 2.1 % on ABTS+) and the treatment based on CZRC coating under light irradiation reduced Pseudomonas fragi (by 2.02 log CFU/mL) and Brochothrix thermosphacta (by 4.35 log CFU/mL), which prolonged the shelf life of lamb and pork to 1.8 and 2.3 times at 4 °C storage condition. This work provides a viable strategy for the development of highly adhesive coatings with self-activation enhanced activity to achieve long-lasting preservation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transsynaptic degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) likely plays a role in progressive loss of vision in glaucoma. Carrageenan (Carr), obtained from seaweed (Rhodophyceae), a sulphated polysaccharide extracted from a species of red algae (Chondrus crispus), is a reversible gel mostly used in eye-drop preparation due to its hydrocolloid nature. But Carr-induced inflammation causing oxidative stress in animals has not yet been evaluated. It was reported that amlodipine (AML) can inhibit inflammatory cytokines by lowering intracellular calcium concentration and increasing antioxidant defences. PURPOSE: In this study, we examined the impact of AML administration on Carr-induced oxidative stress, causing free radial-mediated neurodegeneration and behavioural alteration in zebrafish. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate the behavioural alteration in zebrafish using the novel tank diving test (NTDT) and the light-dark preference test (LDPT) as invaluable tools for analysing visual functions. To understand the role of the antioxidant defence system, oxidative stress biomarkers such as lipid peroxidation and CAT activity were analysed. RGCs of the retina of the eye and neurons of the optical tectum (TeO) in the brain were investigated by histopathological studies. RESULTS: Carr-treated groups swam in random patterns and showed an increased number of transitions and spent more time in alter zones, whereas controls prefer perceived motion. AML significantly attenuates the increased lipid peroxidation level and decreased CAT activity with Carr administration. Histopathological analysis showed an increase in the percentage of pyknotic cell counts after Carr treatment, whereas AML supplementation significantly reduced the pyknotic RGC cell count in the retina and TeO of the brain. CONCLUSION: Findings showed the effectiveness of AML as an antioxidant and neuroprotective agent by reducing pyckonsis in developmental RGCs and possible repair mechanisms against Carr-induced oxidative stress. This study may be useful to know the underlying mechanisms of weakening and eliminating central neurons for synaptic connections in the visual system of zebrafish."

The administered treatments included OA, KCA + OA, KCA + DEO, KCA + DEO + OA, and control. Treating the trout fillets with DEO-loaded coating and/or using OA packaging was found to be more effective in restricting the growth of total mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and lactic acid bacteria. The aforementioned treatments were more efficient in slowing down the rate of increase in pH, total volatile nitrogen, conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein carbonyls, electric conductivity, and organoleptic deterioration in the trout fillets. Notably, the most effective treatment in this context was KCA + DEO + OA. The shelf-life of trout fillets was established through the assessment of multiple parameters. It was determined to be 4 days in both the control and KCA groups, 8 days in the OA and KCA + OA groups, 16 days in the KCA + DEO group, and a minimum of 20 days in the KCA + DEO + OA group. Consequently, our recommendation is to apply an active coating based on KCA, incorporating DEO in conjunction with OA packaging, for the preservation of fish fillets stored in refrigeration.",

METHODS: The efficacy of the nasal spray components was tested in vitro by barrier function, virus replication inhibition, and water absorption assays. The decongestant effectiveness was assessed in a randomized, controlled, crossover environmental chamber trial, where participants with a history of seasonal grass pollen AR were exposed to grass pollen allergens under controlled conditions. Forty-one adults were randomized to receive either carrageenan- and sorbitol-containing nasal spray (CS) or saline solution (SS). After 1 week, participants repeated the exposure with the treatment they had not received before. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in nasal congestion symptom score (NCSS). Secondary efficacy endpoints were nasal airflow, nasal secretion, total nasal symptom score (TNSS), total ocular symptom score (TOSS) and total respiratory symptom score (TRSS). RESULTS: Preclinical assays demonstrated barrier-building, virus-blocking, and water-withdrawing properties of the CS components. In the clinical study, there was no significant difference in mean NCSS change from pre- to post-treatment between CS and SS. However, nasal airflow increased over time after treatment with CS, while it declined after SS, leading to a growing difference in airflow between CS and SS (p = 0.04 at 6:00 h). Mean nasal secretion over 2-6 h was reduced by ~25% after CS (p = 0.003) compared to pre-treatment, while it was reduced by only ~16% after SS (p = 0.137). No significant differences in TNSS, TOSS and TRSS were observed between CS and SS. CONCLUSION: CS improves nasal airflow and reduces nasal secretion in adults with AR. We propose CS as a safe and effective adjuvant to baseline pharmacological treatments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04532762."

      "abstract": "Sulfated polysaccharide lambda carrageenan (λ-CGN) was evaluated for its antiviral effect against IPNV using the in vitro infection model of CHSE-214 salmonid cells. A plaque reduction lysis assay revealed that λ-CGN has an IC50 of 0.9 μg⋅mL-1, CC50 > 128 μg⋅mL-1 and a Selectivity Index (SI) > 142. In comparison, iota, kappa carrageenans and lambda oligo-carrageenan (λ-OC) were less effective than λ-CGN against IPNV. λ-CGN showed no virucidal activity when applied directly to viral particles. Time of addition experiments showed that pre-treatment, co-treatment, and post-treatment with λ-CGN significantly reduced viral RNA copies in the cell supernatant. Additionally, a decrease in intracellular viral RNA was observed with pre-treatment and post-treatment, indicating an impact on different stages of viral replication. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of IPNV genomic RNA in presence of λ-CGN showed a reduction in the level of viral genomic RNA. Confocal microscopy confirmed the intracellular localization of λ-CGN, suggesting that λ-CGN may inhibit the synthesis of IPNV genomic RNA. Moreover, cells pre-treated with λ-CGN showed an increased expression of innate immunity genes CXCL11, IL1β, IFNa, and IRF3. These findings highlight the need for further research to confirm the in vivo pharmacological potential of λ-CGN as a new antiviral agent in salmonids.",

To resolve this problem, herein, a synergistic co-strengthening strategy was designed. The negatively charged polysaccharide carrageenan (CG) was introduced into MP simultaneously with wheat gluten, followed by 120 °C thermal treatment for 30 min. A substantial enhancement in mechanical strength, up to four times greater (from 9.86 to 42.38 g·cm), was observed for MP gels, which even surpassed that subjected to conventional gelation processes at 90 °C (36.53 g·cm). Gels that were concurrently added with gluten and CG exhibited porous networks, uniform water distribution, and improved water holding capacity. Accordingly, over-aggregation behaviors of MP were restricted, as evidenced by their reduced particle sizes and polymer dispersity index. Other heat-induced protein deteriorations at 120 °C, i.e., changes of secondary structures and disulfide bonding conformations, were also alleviated. By varying the CG types, it was shown that the κ-CG/gluten-added MP achieved highest gel strength, while the ι-CG/gluten combination may better stabilize the moisture in gel networks. This study introduces a co-reinforcement paradigm and scientific insights to the quality improvement of ready-to-eat meat products.",

The microcapsules realize the slow-release duration of OEO to over 80 h. More importantly, due to the slow-release effect of OEO, OEO-GE/CRG microcapsules demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against B. cinerea with an EC50 value of 0.18 mg/mL. The microcapsule treatment significantly prolonged the preservation period of cherry tomatoes in infection models with B. cinerea.

      "abstract": "Bitter melon (Momordica charantia L.) is well-known for its high protein, steroid, alkaloid, mineral, lipid, triterpene, and phenolic compound content, as well as its medicinal properties, particularly its anti-diabetic effects. To investigate the impact of elicitors on the morphology and phytochemical characteristics of bitter melon (Jounpouri cultivar) over two consecutive years (2018 and 2019), we conducted a field experiment. The study aimed to determine the effects of Ethrel, brassinosteroids (BRs), and k-carrageenan on yield and the production of anti-diabetic agents in M. charantia farm crops. The elicitors included ten levels, ranging from a control group to Ethrel (100, 300, and 600 mg l- 1), brassinosteroids (BRs) (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg l- 1), and k-carrageenan (200, 400, and 600 mg l- 1). These characteristics included leaf area, leaf length, leaf width, fruit parameters, carbohydrate content, total phenols and flavonoid accumulation, antioxidant activity, total acid, ascorbic acid, momordicine, and charantin. Across both years, we observed the highest flavonoid accumulation and antioxidant activity in the Ethrel treatment group. Specifically, applying 0.5 mg l- 1 BRs and 300 mg l- 1 Ethrel led to an 18.8% and 14.8% increase in momordicine content, respectively. All elicitor treatments, particularly at 0.1 mg l- 1 BRs, significantly increased leaf area, leaf length, and leaf width compared to the control group in both cropping years. Additionally, the application of all elicitors resulted in increased fruit weight, dimensions, and yield over the two consecutive years. Notably, in 2018, 600 mg l- 1 Ethrel contributed to enhanced fruit weight and yield, while in 2019, 0.5 mg l- 1 BRs exhibited the same effect. Metabolic and physiological changes in bitter squash induced by employed elicitors over two different years (2018-2019) are strongly dependent on a variety of environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall. In conclusion, using BRs as an elicitor has the potential to optimize the health benefits of bitter melon by increasing the content of two bioactive molecules, momordicine and charantin.",

The incorporation of potato starch was successfully confirmed through XRD, FT-IR, and SEM analysis, while TGA highlighted the hydrogel's thermal stability. Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated excellent MB removal efficiency, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 116.1 mg/g under optimal conditions (initial dye concentration: 100 mg/L, contact time: 180 min, temperature: 20 °C, adsorbent dosage: 1.6 g/L, and pH: 11). FT-IR analysis indicated that electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding primarily govern the adsorption process. The adsorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption was exothermic and spontaneous. A key feature of this bio hydrogel is its selective affinity for the cationic dye MB, in a mixture with Acid Orange (AO) and other cationic dyes (Rhodamine B (Rh B) and crystal violet (CV)). The adsorbent also demonstrated impressive reusability, maintaining 93 % of its efficiency after five cycles, highlighting its potential for sustainable and cost-effective water treatment.",

In this study, the wound healing potential of bioactive marine sulfated polysaccharides ulvan and carrageenan formulated in gels at concentrations of 1.5%, 5.0%, and 10% w/w was evaluated. Hairless female SKH-hr2 mice (n = 7 per treatment) with burn-inflamed skin were treated with the polysaccharide-based gels, and the therapeutic efficacy was assessed using a comprehensive array of evaluation methods, including a histopathological analysis, clinical observation, photo-documentation, an image analysis, an evaluation of biophysical skin parameters, and FT-IR spectroscopy. Our findings indicate that the 10% w/w carrageenan gel exhibited significant enhancement in wound healing, particularly in the early stages of the healing process. This was evidenced by the restoration of the α-helix structure of collagen and the configuration of glycosaminoglycans, as demonstrated by FT-IR absorption bands of the skin both in vivo and ex vivo. Furthermore, the 5% w/w ulvan gel also demonstrated notable efficacy in promoting wound healing, particularly in the later stages of the healing process. These results suggest that carrageenan and ulvan gels hold promise for improving the efficiency of wound healing in second-degree burn wounds. Our study contributes to the understanding of the therapeutic potential of marine polysaccharides and provides insights into their mechanism of action in promoting wound healing."

Conventional physical and chemical processes for Perfluorooctanoic acid are either expensive or inefficient. This study developed an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective gravity-driven kappa-carrageenan (kC)-based hydrogel for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) removal from synthetic and actual wastewater. Two kC filters were prepared by mixing activated carbon (AC) or vanillin (V) with the kC hydrogel to optimize the hydrogel selectivity and water permeability. Experimental work revealed that the PFOA rejection and water permeability increased with the AC and V concentrations in the kC hydrogel. Experiments also evaluated the impact of feed pH, PFOA concentration, hydrogel composition, and hydrogel thickness on its performance. Due to pore size shrinkage, the AC-kC and V-kC hydrogels achieved the highest PFOA rejection at pH 4, whereas the water flux decreased. Increasing the PFOA concentration reduced water flux and increased PFOA rejection. For 2 cm hydrogel thickness, the water flux of 3%kC-0.3%AC and 3%kC-3%V hydrogels was 25.6 LMH and 21.5 LMH, and the corresponding PFOA rejection was 86.9% for 3%kC-0.3%AC and 85.7% for 3%kC-3%V. Finally, the kC-0.3%AC hydrogel removed 81.1% of PFOA from wastewater of 179 mg/L initial concentration compared to 79.3% for the kC-3%V hydrogel. After three filtration cycles, the water flux decline of 3%kC-0.3%AC was less than 10%. The gravity dead-end kC hydrogel provides sustainable PFOA wastewater treatment with biodegradable and natural materials.",

Quercetin has been tried as an alternative therapy and was found effective. This study aims to optimize quercetin pulmospheres using combination polymers and study its characteristics as an inhalation delivery system. Combination polymers provide the advantages of safe, mucoadhesive, and compact pulmospheres. Pulmospheres were made as formula F1, F2, and F3 (polymer ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3), respectively. Pulmospheres were made with quercetin 0.2%, alginate-carrageenan (total concentration of 1.8%), and CaCl2 0.5 M. Characterization of particle size, morphology, moisture content (MC), yield, drug loading, and entrapment efficiency (EE) were conducted. The yield range was from 83.89 to 86.30% ± 4.59%. MC range was from 4.23 to 5.12% ± 0.05%. Particle size was <3 µm (between 2.19 and 2.76 ± 0.149 µm), spherical shape and smooth surface. EE range was 60.69% ± 4.45% to 77.86% ± 1.74% and the drug loading range was 1.66-2.09% ± 0.15%. F2 formula with a polymer ratio of 1:2 was the best quercetin pulmospheres. Potential pulmospheres will then be recommended for in vitro release and in vivo study."

In this study, nano-in-micro hydrogels (microbeads) of chitosan and κ-carrageenan (CCMBs) containing curcumin-loaded rhamnosomes (Cur-R) were developed. The potential of Cur-R-CCMBs for improving the antibacterial activity and sustained release of curcumin was evaluated. Curcumin-loaded rhamnosomes (rhamnolipids functionalized liposomes) had a mean particle size of 116 ± 7 nm and a surface-charge of -24.5 ± 9.4 mV. The encapsulation efficiency of curcumin increased from 42.83 % ± 0.69 % in Cur-R to 95.24 % ± 3.61 % respectively after their embedding in CCMBs. SEM revealed smooth surface morphology of Cur-R-CCMBs. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of weak electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions among curcumin, rhamnosomes, and microbeads. Cur-R-CCMBs had demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against multi-drug resistant chronic wound pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cur-R-CCMBs also exhibited significantly higher anti-oxidant (76.85 % ± 2.12 %) and anti-inflammatory activity (91.94 % ± 0.41 %) as well as hemocompatibility (4.024 % ± 0.59 %) as compared to pristine microbeads. In vivo infection model of mice revealed significant reduction in the viable bacterial count of S. aureus (∼2.5 log CFU/mL) and P. aeruginosa (∼2 log CFU/mL) for Cur-R-CCMBs after 5 days. Therefore, nano-in-micro hydrogels can improve the overall efficacy of hydrophobic antimicrobials to develop effective alternative-therapeutics against resistant-pathogens associated with chronic wound infections.",

The effect of pressure (400, 500 and 600 MPa), holding time (10, 20 and 30 min) and concentration of κ-CG (0.8%, 1.0% and 1.2%, w/v) on the swelling rate, gel strength, the stability of curcumin in the emulsion gel, water distribution and its mobility, as well as the contents of interface protein were characterized. The results showed that the addition of κ-CG significantly reduced the protein concentration required for the formation of emulsion gel induced by HPP and greatly reduced the swelling rate of the emulsion gel. The gel strength and storage stability of the composite emulsion gels increased with the increase in pressure (400-600 MPa) and holding time (10-30 min). When the pressure increased to 500 MPa, the stability of curcumin in the emulsion gel significantly improved. When the ratio of WPI to κ-CG was 12:1 (the κ-CG concentration was 1.0%), both the photochemical and thermal stability of curcumin were higher than those of the other two ratios. The HPP significantly increased the mobility of monolayer water in the system, while the mobility of multilayer water and immobilized water was significantly reduced. Increasing the holding time and the concentration of κ-CG both can result in an increase in the interfacial protein content in the oil/water system, and the HPP treatment had a significant effect on the composition of the interfacial protein of the emulsion gel."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the adsorption of Oxytetracycline (OTC) from pharmaceutical wastewater using a kappa carrageenan based hydrogel (KPB). The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of KPB for long-term pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. A sustainable adsorbent was developed to address oxytetracycline (OTC) contamination. The hydrogel's structural and adsorption characteristics were examined using various techniques like Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and kinetic models. The results revealed considerable changes in the vibrational modes and adsorption bands of the hydrogel, suggesting the effective functionalization of Bentonite nano-clay. Kappa carrageenan based hydrogel achieved the maximum removal (98.5%) of OTC at concerntration of 40 mg/L, pH 8, cotact time of 140 min and adsorbent dose of 0.1 g (KPB-3). Adsorption of OTC increased up to 99% with increasing initial concentrations. The study achieved 95% adsorption capacity for OTC using a KPB film at a concentration of 20 mg/L and a 0.1 g adsorbent dose within 60 min. It also revealed that chemisorptions processes outperform physical adsorption. The Pseudo-Second-Order model, which emphasized the importance of chemical adsorption in the removal process, is better suited to represent the adsorption behavior. Excellent matches were found that R2 = 0.99 for KPB-3, R2 = 0.984 for KPB-2 and R2 = 0.989 for KPB-1 indicated strong chemical bonding interactions. Statisctical analysis (ANOVA) was performed using SPSS (version 25) and it was found that pH and concentration had significant influence on OTC adsorption by the hydrogel, with p-values less than 0.05. The study identified that a Kappa carrageenan-based hydrogel with bentonite nano-clay and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) can efficiently remove OTC from pharmaceutical effluent, with a p-value of 0.054, but weak positive linear associations with pH, temperature, and contact time. This research contributed to sustainable wastewater treatment and environmental engineering.",

Insulin amyloid (IA), sharing structural resemblances with amyloids linked to neurological disorders, acts as a prototype, while compounds capable of degrading these fibrils hold promise as therapeutic agents for amyloidosis intervention. In this research, liposomal nanoformulated iota carrageenan (nCG) was formulated to disrupt insulin amyloids, demonstrating about a 17-20 % higher degradation efficacy compared to conventional carrageenan through thioflavin T fluorescence, dynamic light scattering analysis, and turbidity quantification. The biocompatibility of the nCG and nCG-treated insulin amyloids was evaluated through MTT assay, live-dead cell assay on V79 cells, and hemolysis testing on human blood samples to establish their safety for use in vitro. Zebrafish embryos were utilized to assess in vivo biocompatibility, while adult zebrafish were employed to monitor the degradation capacity of IA post subcutaneous injection, with fluorescence emitted by the fish captured via IVIS. This demonstrated that the formulated nCG exhibited superior anti-amyloid efficacy compared to carrageenan alone, while both materials demonstrated biocompatibility. Furthermore, through docking simulations, an exploration was conducted into the molecular mechanisms governing the inhibition of the target protein pancreatic insulin by carrageenan.",

      "abstract": "Natural and renewable polymers are gradually replacing petroleum-based plastics, mostly as a result of environmental concerns. Moreover, upcycling industrial food waste into new added-value products is a creative approach that is crucial for cleaner and more sustainable manufacturing. The aim of this study was to obtain an environmentally friendly biodegradable film using a combination of k-carrageenan (KCAR) and chicken gelatin (CGEL), which obtained from poultry by-products. The effects of varying concentrations of KCAR (0-2%) on the physical, permeability, textural, thermal, and microstructural properties of CGEL/KCAR composite films were evaluated. The findings demonstrated that an increase in KCAR enhanced the lightness and opacity levels of the films. Water vapor permeability (WVP) values reduced as the KCAR concentration increased. The lowest WVP value (0.0012 g.mm/h.m2.kpa) was seen in the treatment with 2% KCAR. Tensile strength (TS) values increased with increasing KCAR. The films' thermal stability was increased by the addition of KCAR. Microstructure assessments revealed a more compact and smooth structure in the KCAR-containing treatments, indicating improvements in WVP, thermal stability, and TS. Compared to the commercial cattle gelatin film, the CGEL film had higher TS and lower water solubility (WS). Overall, this study showed that the physical, mechanical, barrier and thermal and microstructural qualities of gelatin-based films may be enhanced by combining CGEL and KCAR to create an effective biodegradable film. Moreover, the comparison study between commercial cattle and chicken gelatin films revealed that cross-linked chicken gelatin films would be a suitable alternative for bovine gelatin films in the production of biodegradable film.",

In this regard, we design a pH-controlled nanocarrier based on magnetic layered double hydroxides/copper metal-organic framework-chitosan crosslinked к-carrageenan hydrogel nanoparticles (LDH-Fe3O4/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR) for targeted release from DOX to breast cancer cells. FT-IR, EDX, XRD, FE-SEM, VSM, and Zeta potential investigated the chemical structure of hydrogel nanoparticles. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading capacity of the DOX were obtained to be 96.1 % and 9.6 %, respectively. The cumulative release of DOX from LDH-Fe3O4/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR at pH 5.5 and 7.4 after 72 h was 60.3 % and 22.6 %, respectively. These in vitro release results confirmed the controlled release and pH-response behavior of hydrogel nanoparticles. Also, the mechanism of DOX release from LDH-Fe3O4/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR hydrogel nanoparticles showed that the Korsmeyer-Peppas model with Fickian diffusion is the best-fitting model for describing the release behavior of DOX from hydrogel nanoparticles. The cellular cytotoxicity and DAPI tests of the prepared LDH and LDH-Fe3O4/Cu MOF toward L929 non-cancerous cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells confirm its relative biocompatibility and safety. Whereas, LDH-Fe3O4/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR hydrogel nanoparticles toward MCF-7 breast cancer cells had higher cytotoxicity effects due to the targeted and controlled release of DOX to MCF-7 cells. The in vitro DPPH, hemolysis assay, colloidal stability, and enzymatic degradation proved the excellent antioxidant activity (71.81 %), blood compatibility (less than 5 %), better stability, and biodegradation behavior of hydrogel nanoparticles. On these findings, the present study suggests the potential of the prepared LDH-Fe3O4/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR hydrogel nanoparticles as a pH-controlled drug delivery system for cancer treatment and various biomedical uses.",

In clinical practice, second-generation histamine H1 -receptor blockers are routinely used as the first-line symptomatic treatment for urticaria. Nevertheless, not much research has directly examined the second-generation histamine H1-receptor blockers' ability to reduce edema. In this study, we directly evaluated the anti-edematous activities of three second-generation histamine H1-receptor blockers available in the market (epinastine hydrochloride, cetirizine hydrochloride, and levocetirizine hydrochloride) using a λ-carrageenan-induced footpad edema model. One hour before the induction of edema with 1% λ -carrageenan injection, all second-generation histamine H1 -receptor blockers (5, 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg) were subcutaneously administered to rats. At 0.5 and 3 hours after λ -carrageenan administration, the edema volume was evaluated using a Plethysmometer. Epinastine hydrochloride significantly suppressed the edema growth in a dose-dependent manner. Cetirizine hydrochloride showed a slight anti-edematous effect, while levocetirizine significantly inhibited the development of edema in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, dextrocetirizine did not prevent edema from growing. In summary, second-generation histamine H1 -receptor blockers, at least those examined in this study, may be able to reduce the clinical symptoms of urticaria associated with edema. Levocetirizine hydrochloride is also anticipated to have stronger anti-edematous effects than cetirizine hydrochloride because levocetirizine is responsible for cetirizine's anti-edematous activity.",

US combined with pre-addition of KC facilitated the binding between MP and KC, which enhanced the gel strength and WHC of the mixed MP gels and significantly improved the rheological behavior of MP. This was also confirmed by the highest surface hydrophobicity, disulfide bonds and β-sheet content of the MP gels with US combined with pre-addition of KC. Moreover, microstructural results reflected a denser structure for the pre-addition of KC in combination with US. However, US combined with post-addition of KC resulted in limited MP unfolding and relatively weak hydrophobic interactions in the composite gels, which were less effective in improving the gel properties of the MP gels. This study provides potential strategies for enhancing the gelling properties of low-salt meat products via application of US and KC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the progression of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), fibrosis of the infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) is a key pathological change. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) inhibits IFP fibrosis by decreasing the gene expression and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), which is a protein involved in IFP fibrosis in KOA rat models. On the other hand, macrophages play an important role in the progression of fibrosis in various tissues, and LIPUS irradiation suppresses macrophage infiltration and inflammatory cytokine secretion. However, whether LIPUS suppresses macrophage polarity and IFP fibrosis in KOA remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of LIPUS on macrophage polarity and IFP fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A KOA model was created by injecting carrageenin into the bilateral knee joints of Wistar rats (eight weeks old). Tissues were harvested over time for histological and molecular biological analysis. The KOA model was also subjected to LIPUS irradiation for two weeks following the injection of carrageenin. RESULTS: RM-4-positive cells were widely distributed in IFP two weeks after carrageenin administration, but M2 macrophages were significantly increased, and the Sirius red area was decreased in the LIPUS-irradiated group compared with those in the non-irradiated group. The gene expression of M1 macrophage markers was significantly decreased and that of M2 macrophage markers was significantly increased in the LIPUS-irradiated group. The expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and type 1 collagen was also significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LIPUS may serve as a novel approach for the treatment of KOA through its effect on M1 macrophages and suppression of TGF-β expression."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of treatments with κ-carrageenan (κ-CAR), egg white powder (EWP), wheat gluten (WG), soy isolate protein (SPI), and a combination of these treatments on the gel properties and protein structures of minced pork. The cooking loss and trapped water within minced pork increased when additives were incorporated; in particular, the SPI group reached 1.31 ± 0.01% and 91.42 ± 0.20%. The hardness and chewiness of minced pork reached their maximum values (38.91 ± 0.80 N, 14.73 ± 0.41 N) when the WG was added. The κ-CAR/WG-minced pork gel network structure was the densest and most stable, characterized by increased hydrophobic interactions, disulfide bonds in the mince gel, and enthalpy value. The α-helix content with κ-CAR/WG treatment decreased from 27% to 7.8%, transforming into other secondary structures. This suggests that the addition of κ-CAR/WG can be a more effective combination for improving the quality of minced pork."

This study investigates the anti-inflammatory properties of a polyphenolic fraction derived from GP, obtained by ultrasound-microwave hybrid extraction and purified using ion-exchange chromatography. In the inflammation model, mice were divided into six groups: intact, carrageenan, indomethacin, and three GP polyphenols treatment groups. Paw edema was induced by subplantar injection of carrageenan, and the GP polyphenols were administered intraperitoneally at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg. The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by measuring paw volume, and expression of inflammatory markers: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6), along with lipid peroxidation levels. The GP polyphenols significantly reduced paw edema and expression levels of COX-2, MPO, and cytokines in a dose-dependent manner effect, with the highest dose showing the greatest reduction. Additionally, lipid peroxidation levels were also decreased by GP polyphenols treatment at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. These findings suggest that ultrasound-microwave extraction combined with amberlite purification proved to be effective in obtaining a polyphenolic-rich fraction from GP. Thus, GP polyphenols may serve as a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent for treating inflammation and oxidative stress-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Hydrogels based on natural polysaccharides have demonstrated efficacy in epithelial recovery from cutaneous burn wounds. Here, we prepared a double-network hydrogel consisting of galactomannan (from Cassia grandis seeds) and κ-carrageenan (commercially sourced), cross-linked with CaCl2, as a matrix for immobilizing lactoferrin and/or Cramoll, aiming at its applicability as dressings for second-degree burn wounds. The formulations obtained [H - hydrogel, HL - hydrogel + lactoferrin, HC - hydrogel + Cramoll and HLC - hydrogel + lactoferrin + Cramoll] were analyzed rheologically as well as in terms of their stability (pH, color, microbial contamination) for 90 days. The burn was created with an aluminum bar (97 ± 3 °C) in the dorsal region of Wistar rats and subsequently treated with hydrogels (H, HL, HC, HLC) and control saline solution (S). The burn was monitored for 3, 7 and 14 days to evaluate the efficacy of the hydrogels in promoting wound healing. The hydrogels did not reveal significant pH or microbiological changes; there was an increase in brightness and a reduction in opacity for H. The rheological analysis confirmed the gel-like viscoelastic signature of the systems without substantial modification of the basic rheological characteristics, however HLC proved to be more rigid, due to rheological synergy when combining protein biomolecules. Macroscopic analyses confirmed centripetal healing with wound contraction: S < H < HC < HL < HLC. Histopathological analyses showed that hydrogel-treated groups reduced inflammation, tissue necrosis and fibrosis, while promoting re-epithelialization with focal acanthosis, especially in HLC due to a positive synergistic effect, indicating its potential as a promising therapy in the repair of burns.",

      "abstract": "CNCs are intensively studied to reinforce biocomposites. However, it remains a challenge to homogeneously disperse the CNC in biocomposites for a smooth film surface. Mechanochemical treatment via ultrasonication in deep eutectic solvent (DES) generated a stable dispersion of CNC before incorporation into carrageenan biocomposite. Shifted peaks of choline chloride (ChCl) methylene groups to 3.95-3.98 ppm in 1H NMR indicated a formation of eutectic mixture between the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD) at the functional group of CH3···OH. The swelling of CNC in the DES was proven by the formation of intermolecular H-bond at a length of 2.46 Å. The use of DES contributed to a good dispersion of CNC in the solution which increased zeta potential by 43.2 % compared to CNC in deionized water. The ultrasonication amplitude and feed concentration were varied for the best parameters of a stable dispersion of CNC. The crystallinity of 1 wt% of CNC at 20 % sonication amplitude improved from 76 to 81 %. The high crystallinity of CNCDES resulted in an increase in film tensile and capsule loop strength of Carra-CNCDES by 20.7 and 19.4 %, respectively. Improved dispersion of CNCDES reduced the surface roughness of the biocomposite by 21.8 %. H-bond network in CNCDES improved the biocomposite properties for an ingenious reinforcement material.",

In this paper, we developed a biopolymer-based filtration system using sodium alginate (NaAlg) and carrageenan (Car) for the removal of the toxic cationic dye, methylene blue (MB). The membrane's properties were assessed using FTIR, TGA, UTM, FESEM, EDS, XRD, and water uptake, revealing commendable thermomechanical stability (5.79 MPa), good hydrophilicity, and compatibility. The experimental results further revealed that lambda Car/calcium alginate (λ-Car/CaAlg) exhibited superior dye rejection (100%) and flux (11.67 L m-2 h-1) compared to kappa Car/CaAlg (κ-Car/CaAlg) (99.22% and 11.19 L m-2 h-1) and plain alginate (CaAlg) (99.63% and 9.79 L m-2 h-1). The high MB rejection rate was attributed to the sieving mechanism and electrostatic interaction. A rejection rate of 100% was achieved at an initial MB concentration of 10 mg/L, pressure of 0.1 MPa, pH of 7, and temperature of 25°C. Furthermore, the hydrogel membranes demonstrated excellent recyclability over nine cycles, indicating their potential for water treatment applications.",

Sperm kinematics were assessed immediately after thawing (AT) and post-incubation for 120 min. The viability, acrosome integrity, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and intracellular caspase activity were measured AT. The results indicated that 0.2 mg/mL κ-Carrageenan increased total and progressive motility AT and post-incubation for 120 min (p < 0.05). Moreover, the viable sperm percentage and MMP after 0.2 mg/mL treatment were higher than those after control and other κ-Carrageenan concentration treatments. The proportion of acrosome-intact spermatozoa was significantly higher after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/mL κ-Carrageenan treatment than that after control and other κ-Carrageenan concentration treatments. The intracellular caspase activity was not significantly different among the experimental groups. However, the MDA concentration after 0.2 mg/mL κ-Carrageenan treatment was lower (p < 0.05) than that after the control treatment. Taken together, adding κ-Carrageenan to the porcine semen freezing extender improved the FT sperm quality mainly by influencing membrane stability and protecting against oxidative stress."

The results of optical imaging, particle size distribution, and rheology exhibited that with the addition of crosslinking agents, denser and more homogeneous emulsion gels were formed, along with a relative decrease in the droplet size and a gradual increase in viscosity. Especially when the concentration of citric acid (CA) was 0.09 wt%, KC was 0.8 wt%, and K+ was present in the system, the double-network emulsion gel was stable at high temperatures and in freezing environments, and the swelling ratio was the lowest (9.41%). Gastrointestinal tract digestive treatments and pasteurization revealed that the probiotics encapsulated in the double-network emulsion gel had a higher survival rate, which was attributed to the synergistic cross-linking of CA and K+ biopolymers to construct the emulsion gels.

      "abstract": "Selenium-containing compounds have emerged as promising treatment for redox-based and inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of a novel diselenide named as dibenzyl[diselanediyIbis(propane-3-1diyl)] dicarbamate (DD). DD reacted with HOCl (k = 9.2 x 107 M-1s-1), like glutathione (k = 1.2 x 108 M-1s-1), yielding seleninic and selenonic acid derivatives, and it also decreased HOCl formation by activated human neutrophils (IC50=4.6 μM) and purified myeloperoxidase (MPO) (IC50=3.8 μM). However, tyrosine, MPO-I and MPO-II substrates, did not restore HOCl formation in presence of DD. DD inhibited the oxidative burst in dHL-60 cells with no toxicity up to 25 µM for 48h. Next, an intraperitoneal administration of 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg DD decreased total leukocyte, neutrophil chemotaxis, and inflammation markers (MPO activity, lipid peroxidation, albumin exudation, nitrite, TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL1/KC, and CXCL2/MIP-2) on a murine model of carrageenan-induced peritonitis. Likewise, 50 mg/kg DD (i.p.) decreased carrageenan-induced paw edema over 5h. Histological and immunohistochemistry analyses of the paw tissue showed decreased neutrophil count, edema area, and MPO, carbonylated, and nitrated protein staining. Furthermore, DD treatment decreased the fMLP-induced chemotaxis of human neutrophils (IC50=3.7 μM) in vitro with no toxicity. Lastly, DD presented no toxicity in a single-dose model using mice (50 mg/kg, i.p.) over 15 days and in Artemia salina bioassay (50 to 2000 µM), corroborating findings from in silico toxicological study. Altogether, these results demonstrate that DD attenuates carrageenan-induced inflammation mainly by reducing neutrophil migration and the resulting damage from MPO-mediated oxidative burst.",

To investigate carrageenan's lack of protective effect, we compared the change in anal HPV16 and HPV18 viral loads following carrageenan use against placebo. We restricted our analysis to participants who completed the first four study visits and had a valid baseline sample (n = 161, 54 HIV-positive). Samples were tested for HPV detection using the linear array PCR assay. HPV16- and/or HPV18-positive samples were tested for viral load using real-time PCR. For participants who tested HPV16- (n = 29) or HPV18-positive (n = 10) at least once across visits 1-4, we compared the change in type-specific viral load between study arms using the Mann-Whitney U test. Although the median net change in HPV16 and HPV18 viral loads across visits 1-4 was higher in the treatment than placebo arm (HPV16: 0.68 vs. 0.18 copies/cell, p = 0.60; HPV18: 18.32 vs. 10.12 copies/cell, p = 0.52), these differences were not statistically significant. Results were similar by HIV status. Carrageenan use did not impact anal HPV16 or HPV18 viral loads, which may further explain its lack of protective effect in gbMSM.",

      "abstract": "κ-Carrageenan (KC) is a polysaccharide widely used in food industry. It has been widely studied for its excellent physicochemical and beneficial properties. However, the high molecular weight and high viscosity of KC make it difficult to be absorbed and to exert its' biological activities, thus limit its extensive industrial application. In order to solve this problem, five low molecular weight κ-carrageenans (DCPs) were prepared by the degradation of KC using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ascorbic acid (AH2). The chemical compositions and structure characteristics of the DCPs were then determined. The results showed that H2O2 and AH2 could effectively degrade KC to DCPs, and DCPs remained the basic skeletal structure of KC. DCPs showed good antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of DCPs with the highest antibacterial effects were 5.25, 4.5, 5.25, and 4.5 mg/mL, respectively. This is due to the underlying mechanism of DCPs that bind to the bacterial membrane proteins and change the membrane permeability, thus exerting antibacterial activity. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation and Ridge regression analysis revealed that the molecular weight and the contents of 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose, aldehyde group, carboxyl, and sulfate were the main structural characteristics affecting the antibacterial activity. Our findings reveal that the H2O2-AH2 degradation treatment could significantly improve the antibacterial activity of KC and provide insights into the quantitative structure-activity relationships of the antibacterial activity of DCPs.",

The results demonstrated that simply adding KC enhanced the gel strength and water holding capacity (WHC) of MP gels. Moreover, the gel strength and WHC of MP gels were increased by 56.67 % and 76.19 % via 20 min US treatment synergized with KC, which was mainly attributed to the changes in sulfhydryl content, surface hydrophobicity, and fluorescence intensity of MP gels. Based on the results of molecular docking and secondary structure, it can be hypothesized that the synergistic effect resulted in the rearrangement of the proteins, which altered the interaction site between MP gels and KC, accompanied by stronger binding. Furthermore, the microstructural results indicated that moderate US treatment (20 min) facilitated the production of a more compact and denser MP gels matrix with uniformly sized and distributed pores. However, excessive US treatment (40 and 50 min) caused the MP gels to form looser and disordered gel structure, which reduced the gel strength and WHC. This study suggested that combining of US and KC was a potential tactic to enhance the gelling properties of heat-induced MP gels.",

In this study, the borax-crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol/k-carrageenan (kC) conducting hydrogels (BPKKOH) were prepared by a simple one-pot method, and KOH treatment was used instead of the cumbersome and time-consuming freeze-thaw cycle to improve the comprehensive properties. The KOH treatment increased the hydrogel hydrogen bonding content by 7.72 % and synergized with the induction of kC by K+ to enhance the tensile and compressive strengths by 8.12 and 34.6 times, respectively. Meanwhile, the BPKKOH hydrogel's fatigue resistance and shape recovery after water loss were improved. Additionally, the BPKKOH hydrogels can be monitored for finger bending, showing clear and stable differences in electrical signals. BPKKOH hydrogels combined with Morse code realize applications in information transmission and encryption/decryption. Notably, introducing KOH ensures the molding and preparation of BPKKOH hydrogel fibers while having good signal responsiveness and monitoring ability. More importantly, it can be woven into fabrics that can be loaded with heavy weights, which has the potential to be directly applied in smart wearables.

      "abstract": "Water scarcity and contamination have emerged as critical global challenges, requiring the development of effective and sustainable solutions for the treatment of contaminated water. Recently, functionalized polymer biomaterials have garnered significant interest because of their potential for a wide range of water treatment applications. Accordingly, this paper highlights the design of a new adsorbent material based on a cellulosic nonwoven textile grafted with two extracted biopolymers. The layer-by-layer grafting technique was used for the polyelectrolyte multi-layer (PEM) biosorbent production. Firstly, we extracted a Suaeda fruticosa polysaccharide (SFP) and confirmed its pectin-like polysaccharide structure via SEC, NMR spectroscopy, and chemical composition analyses. Afterward, the grafting was designed via an alternating multi-deposition of layers of SFP polymer and carrageenan crosslinked with 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA). FT-IR and SEM were used to characterize the chemical and morphological characteristics of the designed material. Chemical grafting via polyesterification reactions of the PEM biosorbent was confirmed through FT-IR analysis. SEM revealed the total filling of material microspaces with layers of grafted biopolymers and a rougher surface morphology. The assessment of the swelling behavior revealed a significant increase in the hydrophilicity of the produced adsorbent system, a required property for efficient sorption potential. The evaluation of the adsorption capabilities using the methylene blue (MB) as cationic dye was conducted in various experimental settings, changing factors such as the pH, time, temperature, and initial concentration of dye. For the untreated and grafted materials, the greatest adsorbed amounts of MB were 130.6 mg/g and 802.6 mg/g, respectively (pH = 4, T = 22 C, duration = 120 min, and dye concentration = 600 mg/L). The high adsorption performance, compared to other reported materials, was due to the presence of a large number of hydroxyl, sulfonate, and carboxylic functional groups in the biosorbent polymeric system. The adsorption process fitted well with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and Langmuir/Temkin adsorption isotherms. This newly developed multi-layered biosorbent shows promise as an excellent adsorption resultant and cheap-cost/easy preparation alternative for treating industrial wastewater."

Four distinct samples, with carrageenan to activated carbon ratios of 1:0 (CAR), 2:1 (CAC2), 4:1 (CAC4), and 10:1 (CAC10), were prepared. These polymeric beads underwent comprehensive evaluation for their methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity, gel content (GC), and swelling ratio (SR). Increasing activated carbon content up to 50 % of carrageenan mass significantly enhanced GC and SR by 20.57 % and 429.24 %, respectively. Various analytical techniques were employed to characterize the composites, including FTIR, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and EDS-Mapping. Batch adsorption tests investigated the effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration, and temperature on MB adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities for CAR, CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2 were 475.48, 558.54, 635.93, and 552.35 mg/g, respectively, under optimal conditions. Kinetic models (Elovich and pseudo-second-order) and isotherm models (Temkin for CAR and Freundlich for CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2) fitted well with the experimental data. Thermodynamic analysis showed spontaneous, exothermic MB adsorption. Primary mechanisms include electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, n-π, and π-π stacking.

These films possess better UV barrier and mechanical and antimicrobial properties with 1 mM AgNO3 solution. The presence of silver nanoparticles in the carrageenan matrix was evident from FESEM. The mechanical properties were analysed by a Universal testing machine (UTM) and different properties like water vapour permeability (WVP), moisture content (MC) and total soluble matter (TSM) important for food packing applications were also analysed. The antimicrobial properties of the synthesized film samples were studied against E. coli and S. aureus pathogenic bacteria.

      "abstract": "Inflammation is a part of the body's intricate biological reaction to noxious stimuli and defensive reactions. So, the aim of this investigation was to study the anti-inflammatory activity of exopolysaccharide (EPSSM) using carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats. A halophilic bacterial strain was isolated from marine sediments in the Red Sea in Egypt. The isolate has been visually and physiologically recognized, as well as by analyzing its 16S rRNA gene, which confirms Kocuria sp. clone Asker4. This particular isolate can be referenced using the accession number OL798051.1. EPSSM was subjected to purification and fractionation by a DEAE-cellulose column. Preliminary chemical analysis of EPSSM indicated that the monosaccharides were fructose, glucuronic acid, and xylose, with 2.0, 0.5, and 1.0, respectively. The antioxidant potential of EPSSM was investigated, and it was discovered that the level of activity increased independently of the concentrations, reaching a maximum threshold of 94.13% at 100 µg/mL of EPSSM for 120 min. Also, EPSSM at 50 mg/kg orally produced a significant anti-inflammatory effect on the carrageenan model at 2, 3, and 4 intervals. The EPSSM intervention resulted in reductions in the levels of catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes, as well as a decrease in glutathione. Furthermore, the levels of nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species resulting from carrageenan-induced edema showed a significant reduction subsequent to the administration of EPSSM. Moreover, the findings indicated that the protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-6 were reduced following treatment with EPSSM, resulting in a reduction of paw edema.",

Plastic particles are classified into fifteen groups representing various shapes: disks, rods, blades, spheres, and materials: PS, POM, PET, PA6. The sinking of individual particles in a settling tank was visualized using the shadowgraph method and images were recorded using a camera with macro lenses. Next, Particle Tracking Velocimetry was applied to retrieve the time-resolved position of MPs and their orientation and to calculate instantaneous sinking velocity. Non-Newtonian properties of solutions were measured using a rheometer. Shear-dependent viscosity, shear stress amplitude sweeps, the first normal stress difference, and gelling time were assessed. Datasets may find application in a range of scientific and engineering areas including fluid mechanics, chemical engineering, food engineering, petroleum industry, wastewater treatment, rheology, and environmental hydrodynamics, e.g. in research on particle dynamics in complex fluids, modeling of microplastics fate in aqueous systems, and to develop numerical models on the hydrodynamics of solid particles in complex liquids."

Compared with composite nanoparticles without ultrasound treatment, the encapsulation efficiency of nanoparticles was increased (90.36 %) after ultrasound treatment (320 W, 15 min). Ultrasound treatment reduced the particle size and PDI of nanoparticles and improved the stability and solubility of nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the nanoparticles treated with ultrasound were smooth spherical and uniformly distributed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results showed that the main forces that form nanoparticles are hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence and CD chromatography showed that ultrasound treatment alters the secondary structure of zein and maintains nanoparticle stability. Encapsulation of daidzein in nanocarriers with ultrasound treatment can effectively scavenge DPPH and ABTS free radicals, improve antioxidant activity, and realize the slow release of daidzein in the gastrointestinal tract. The results showed that ultrasonication helps the construction of hydrophobic bioactives delivery carriers and provides better protection for unstable bioactives.",

We aim to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Callergin (investigational product, IP), a nasal spray containing barrier-forming iota-carrageenan, in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, crossover trial, adults with grass pollen allergy underwent a treatment sequence with IP, VisAlpin (comparator product, CP), and no treatment in random order. Treatment blocks consisted in prophylactic administration of the assigned treatment or no treatment, followed by a 3-hr allergen exposure, and were separated by a washout period of 7 days. Primary endpoint was a mean change from baseline in \"Total Nasal Symptom Score\" (TNSS, sum of rhinorrhea, itching, sneezing, and congestion scores) over 3 hr, recorded every 15 min during the challenge period. RESULTS: A total of 42 participants underwent randomization. Exposure to grass pollen for 3 hr induced a notable TNSS increase from baseline in all participants at all times. Mean TNSS change from baseline over 3 hr was lower when participants received IP compared to no treatment, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (untreated 6.96 ± 2.30; IP 6.59 ± 1.93; difference 0.37 points [95% CI (confidence interval) -0.17 to 0.91]; p=0.170). In a post-hoc analysis, mean TNSS at 3 hr was significantly reduced after IP treatment compared to no treatment (untreated 8.29 ± 2.64; IP 7.70 ± 2.56; difference 0.60 points [95% CI -0.10 to 1.29] p=0.028). While all individual nasal symptoms contributed to this effect, rhinorrhea (p=0.013) and congestion (p=0.076) contributed most. Consistently, nasal secretion weight was slightly reduced with IP treatment (p=0.119). IP was safe and well-tolerated, with similar incidence of adverse events across treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with the iota-carrageenan nasal spray IP is safe, well-tolerated, and alleviates nasal allergy symptoms in adults with grass pollen-induced AR.

Here, we demonstrate the visible-light-induced photo-crosslinking of methacrylate-κ-carrageenan (MA-κ-CA) mixed with bioactive silica nanoparticles (BSNPs) to fabricate 3D composite hydrogels using digital light processing (DLP) printing. The 3D printing of complex bone structures, such as the gyroid, was demonstrated with high precision and resolution. DLP-printed 3D composite hydrogels of MA-κ-CA-BSNP were prepared and systematically assessed for their macroporous structure, swelling, and degradation characteristics. The viscosity, rheological, and mechanical properties were also investigated for the influence of nanoparticle incorporation in the MA-κ-CA hydrogels. The in vitro study performed with MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast-laden scaffolds of MA-κ-CA-BSNP revealed high cell viability, no cytotoxicity, and proliferation over 21 days with markedly enhanced osteogenic differentiation compared to neat polymeric scaffolds. Furthermore, no inflammation was observed in the 21-day study involving the in vivo examination of DLP-printed 3D composite scaffolds in a Wistar rat model. Overall, the observed results for the DLP-printed 3D composite scaffolds of MA-κ-CA and BSNP demonstrate their biocompatibility and suitability for bone tissue engineering.",

DESIGN: Rat masseter muscles were injected with saline or carrageenan. Seventy-seven adult male rats were divided into six groups: Sal, saline; Car, carrageenan; Ibup + Sal, ibuprofen and saline; Ibup + Car, ibuprofen and carrageenan; O3 + Sal, ozone and saline; and O3 + Car, ozone and carrageenan. The mixture of 5% ozone and 95% oxygen (20 µg/mL) was administered three times in the course of a week. Nociceptive responses in the masseter muscles were measured using a head withdrawal threshold, determined by an electronic von Frey anesthesiometer. The animals were euthanized one or eight days after the carrageenan injection, and the masseters were submitted to histological and histomorphometric analyses. RESULTS: Mechanical allodynia and inflammation levels were reduced in the Ibup + Car group compared to the other groups. Myonecrosis was similar among carrageenan-treated groups. Picrosirius red stained sections showed more collagen fibers and more regenerating myofibers in the O3 + Car group compared to the other groups. Eight days after carrageenan injection, the O3 + Car group showed neutrophils close to the regenerating myofibers. CONCLUSIONS: Intramuscular ozone therapy did not alleviate mechanical allodynia, and it did not protect the masseter muscle against the deleterious effects produced by carrageenan, probably due to the mode of administration of this therapeutic agent.",

Using RAW264.7 macrophages, we investigated the proliferation and migration capacity of different extracts along with their immunomodulatory activities, including nitric oxide (NO) production, phagocytosis, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Polysaccharides from C. crispus and S. gaudichaudii effectively mitigated inflammation and improved scratch-wound healing. Polysaccharide fractions extracted under cold conditions (25 °C), including CC-1A, SG-1A and SG-1B stimulated cell proliferation, while fractions extracted under hot conditions (95 °C), including CC-3A, CC-2B and A. devoniensis (AD-3A), inhibited cell proliferation after 48 h. Furthermore, RAW264.7 cells treated with the fractions CC-3A, AD-1A, and SG-2A significantly reduced LPS-stimulated NO secretion over 24 h. Phagocytosis was significantly improved by treatment with C. crispus (CC-2B, CC-3B) and A. devoniensis (AD-3A) fractions. RAW264.7 cells treated with the CC-2A and SG-1A fractions showed elevated TGF-β1 expression without affecting TNF-α expression at 24 h. Polysaccharide fractions of A. devoniensis (ι/κ hybrid carrageenan; AD-2A, AD-3A) showed the highest anti-coagulation activity. CC-2A and SG-1A fractions enhanced various bioactivities, suggesting they are candidates for skin-health applications. The carrageenan fractions (CC-3A: λ-, μ-carrageenan, SG-2A: ν-, ι-carrageenan) tested herein showed great potential for developing anti-inflammatory and upscaled skin-health applications.",

      "abstract": "Bacteriophages are employed as cost-effective and efficient antibacterial agents to counter the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other host bacteria in phage therapy. The increasing incidence of skin wounds is a significant concern in clinical practice, especially considering the limitations of antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, the lack of an effective delivery system that preserves the stability of bacteriophages hampers their clinical implementation. In recent years, there has been a growing amount of research on bacteriophage applications in veterinary and biomedical sciences. In our study, lytic coliphage vB_Eco2571-YU1 was isolated against pathogenic Escherichia coli host bacteria, and hydrogel wound dressing materials were fabricated with marine polysaccharide carrageenan (carr-vB_Eco2571-YU1) for their antibacterial activity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) morphology identified it as a Myoviridae coliphage with an icosahedral head length and width of approximately 60 and 56.8 nm, respectively, and a tail length of 119.7 nm. The one-step growth curve of coliphage revealed a latent period of 10 min, a rise period of 15 min, and a burst size of 120 virions per cell. The bacteriolytic activity of unimmobilized coliphages was observed within 2 h; however, strain-specific phage resistance was acquired after 9 h. In contrast, carr-vB_Eco2571-YU1 showed a sharp decline in the growth of bacteria in the log phase after 2 h and did not allow for the acquisition of phage resistance by the E. coli strain. The stability of coliphage under different pH, temperature, osmolarity, detergents, and organic solvents was evaluated. We also studied the long-term storage of carr-vB_Eco2571-YU1 hydrogels at 4 °C and found that the titer value decreased during a time-dependent period of 28 days. These hydrogels were also found to be hemocompatible using a hemolysis assay. The addition of plasticizer (0.6 % (w/v)) to the carrageenan (2 % (w/v)) to prepare carr-vB_Eco2571-YU1 hydrogels showed a decrease in compressive strength with enhanced elasticity. This phage therapy using polymeric immobilization of bacteriophages is a promising next-generation wound dressing biomaterial alternative to conventional wound and skin care management.",

Water extraction of protein is environmentally friendly and could prevent the loss of protein functionality due to extreme pH changes. This study demonstrates an aqueous extraction method, coupled with ultrasound as pre-treatment, to obtain buckwheat protein (BWPE) and assess its gelling property and composited gel with kappa-carrageenan (k-carr). Textural and rheological analyses showed that the hardness and storage modulus of the composited gel containing 1 % w/w BWPE and 1 % w/w k-carr was 4.2-fold and 100-fold, respectively, higher than k-carr gel at 1 % w/w. Light microscopy showed a mixed bi-continuous gel system, with k-carr reinforcing the protein gel network. Besides volume exclusion effects, chemical bond and FTIR analyses revealed that adding k-carr to BWPE altered the protein's secondary structure and mediated protein denaturation during heating. This results in greater β-sheet content, which creates a more organised gel structure. These results demonstrated that ultrasound-assisted water-extracted BWPE, together with varying concentrations of k-carr, can be used to develop composited gels of tailorable textural and rheological properties to suit different food applications.",

The NCs, encompassing various ratios of k-carrageenan and linseed mucilage polymers (8:2, 7:3, and 5:5 w/w) with 1.25 mg of macela extract/g of gel, underwent in vitro assessment, emphasizing viscosity, degradation speed, release of herbal actives from macela nanoemulsion and antimicrobial activity. The NCs exhibited thermoreversible characteristics, transitioning from liquid at 60°C to a gel at 25°C. NCs allowed a gradual release of phenolic compounds, reaching approximately 80% of total phenolics release (w/v) within 72 h. NCs inhibited the growth of MRSA (ATCC 33592) until 8 h of incubation. No toxic effect in vitro of NCs was found on MAC-T cells. Thus, the developed materials are relevant for the treatment of bovine mastitis, especially in the dry period, and the data support future evaluations in vivo.",

To confirm the structure of the produced matrix, characterization methods such as XRD, SEM, FTIR, and EDX were used. Batch experiments were employed in order to further evaluate the adsorption efficiency of Pb2+ ions. Additionally, various variables, including contact time, solution pH, adsorbent dosage, and initial concentration of Pb2+ ions were investigated using atomic absorption. The results of this study showed that the adsorption equilibrium increased as Pb2+ ions concentration increased at pH = 5.3 after a contact time of 120 min, with 0.3 g of Ts-Car/Alg that having the best adsorption capacity at 74 mg/g. The adsorption progression was further examined using the kinetic and isothermal models. With a correlation coefficient of 0.975, the Freundlich model was thought to better fit Pb2+ ions adsorption from the isotherm investigation. Also, the adsorption kinetics were investigated using a pseudo-second-order model with 1/n ratio of 0.683. This Ts-Car/Alg adsorbent is regarded as an effective candidate to be used for water treatment because the reusability process of produced beads was successfully completed twice, and the adsorbent maintained its ability to remove Pb2+ ions. The prepared Ts-Car/Alg beads are therefore excellent candidates to be used as potent Pb2+ ions adsorbents from their aqueous solutions. The Ts-Car/Alg beads' regeneration and reusability investigation for the removal of heavy metal ions was completed in at least two successful cycles."

The application of shear led to a notable reduction in non-sedimentable proteins, resulting in an increase in the average particle size and apparent viscosity of the dispersions, particularly at high concentrations of k-carrageenan and elevated temperatures. This indicates that shear forces induced prominent protein aggregation, especially at higher κ-carrageenan concentrations. This aggregation was primarily attributed to the destabilisation of micelles and presence of loosely bound caseins within the κ-carrageenan network, which exhibited increased susceptibility to aggregation as collision frequencies increased due to shear."

The results indicated that incorporation of either CP or CW significantly increased turbidity, surface hydrophobicity, particle size and rheological behaviour of MP. In contrast, the protein solubility and fluorescence intensity of MP decreased when added with each form of κ-carrageenan (P < 0.05). These observed effects improved MP's gelling properties and produced a more compact and homogenous gel network after heating treatment. Moreover, the addition of CW rendered higher gel strength, water holding capacity and intermolecular interactions, such as ionic, hydrogen and disulphide bonds and hydrophobic interactions in MP gel compared with those added with CP, especially for 0.3 M NaCl (P < 0.05). Furthermore, addition of CW significantly decreased the α-helix content of MP gels (P < 0.05), which mainly contributing to the transformation from a random structure to an organised configuration. In addition, a higher NaCl concentration (0.6 M) enhanced the gelling properties of MP gels compared with 0.3 M NaCl concentration in the presence of each form of κ-carrageenan. Therefore, our present study indicated that incorporation form of κ-carrageenan and ionic strength have distinctive effects on regulating physicochemical characteristics and improves gelling properties of MP.",

Challenges in treatment include adverse effects and resistance to standard antimicrobial agents. Given this context, a sesame seed oil nanoemulsion (SONE) was developed and showed anti-Trichomonas vaginalis activity. To facilitate the local application of SONE, a polysaccharide film was developed using xanthan gum (XG) and κ-carrageenan gum (CG). A blend of XG and CG (at 2 %, ratio 1:3) plasticized with glycerol produced a more promising film (XCF) than using the gums individually. The film containing SONE (SONE-XCF) was successfully obtained by replacing the aqueous solvent with SONE via solvent evaporation technique. The hydrophilic SONE-XCF exhibited homogeneity and suitable mechanical properties for vaginal application. Furthermore, SONE-XCF demonstrated mucoadhesive properties and high absorption capacity for excessive vaginal fluids produced in vaginitis. It also had a disintegration time of over 8 h, indicating long retention at the intended site of action. Hemolysis and chorioallantoic membrane tests confirmed the safety of the film. Therefore, SONE-XCF is a biocompatible film with a natural composition and inherent activity against T. vaginalis, possessing exceptional characteristics that make it appropriate for vaginal application, offering an interesting alternative for trichomoniasis treatment.",

      "abstract": "This work aimed to investigate the combined effect of ultrasound (US) treatment and κ-carrageenan (KC) addition on the gelling properties and rheological behaviors of myofibrillar protein (MP). Without US treatment, the KC incorporation promoted the gel strength and water-holding capacity (WHC) of MP gels. These properties were further improved by 20 min US treatment with gel strength of 98.61 g and WHC of 79.87 %, which was mainly attributed to changes associated with hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds and the transformation from α-helix to β-sheet in MP gels. In addition, US treatment for 20 min effectively resulted in a more homogeneous polymer distribution of the MP-KC mixed system, leading to lower particle size and the largest G' and G″ values of the MP-KC mixed gels. However, longer US treatment times (30, 40 and 50 min) rendered lower gel strength, WHC, storage modulus and loss modulus of MP-KC mixed gels, which was mainly due to the formation of loose and disordered gel structures. Our present results indicated that the application of US to MP for an intermediate treatment time (20 min) combined with KC provides a potential and novel strategy to promote the gel qualities of heat-induced MP gels.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Inflammation has been identified as a key factor contributing to the development of numerous diseases. Several anti-inflammatory drugs have been developed to treat inflammation-related diseases. However, some of such drugs are associated with varying degrees of side effects. Therefore, it is imperative to develop new anti-inflammatory drugs with reducing side effects for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. Natural anti-inflammatory drugs have emerged as an important area of research in recent years. The study was to determine the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Paridis rhizoma extract (PRE) in rat models of acute inflammation induced by carrageenan and RAW264.7 cells models induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: PRE was investigated using the carrageenan-induced paw oedema model on rats in vivo. Histopathology examined the extent of inflammatory infiltration and tissue damage. The effect of PRE on the levels of specific cytokines was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay evaluated the cytotoxic effects of PRE on Raw264.7 cells. The mRNA expression levels of cytokines were quantified using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Western blot measured TNF-α, IL6, TLR4, p-P65, p-IKB, HO1, SOD1 and SOD2. Fluorescence measured the cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: PRE treatment reduced interstitial edema and structural damage in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. PRE inhibited inflammatory responses in vivo and in vitro, as evidenced by the decreased expression of inflammatory factors, production of ROS, and increased expression of SOD1, SOD2, and HO1. Moreover, PRE inhibited the activity of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory activity and potential mechanism of PRE were demonstrated according to the results. PRE reduced LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells by inhibiting the NF-KB signaling pathway and ROS production in vitro. PRE alleviated interstitial edema and structural damage in the carrageenan-induced paw edema model on rats in vivo. This study provided an idea for future development of PR-based anti-inflammatory drugs.",

However, the cell-surface receptor and related signaling pathways remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of KCG-induced platelet activation using light-transmittance aggregometry, flow cytometry, western blotting, and surface plasmon resonance assays using platelets from platelet receptor-deficient mice and recombinant proteins. KCG-induced tail thrombosis was also evaluated in mice lacking the platelet receptor. We found that KCG induces platelet aggregation with α-granule secretion, activated integrin αIIbβ3, and phosphatidylserine exposure. As this aggregation was significantly inhibited by the Src family kinase inhibitor and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor, a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway is required. Platelets exposed to KCG exhibited intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, linker activated T cells, and phospholipase C gamma 2. KCG-induced platelet aggregation was abolished in platelets from C-type lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2)-deficient mice, but not in platelets pre-treated with glycoprotein VI-blocking antibody, JAQ1. Surface plasmon resonance assays showed a direct association between murine/human recombinant CLEC-2 and KCG. KCG-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia were significantly inhibited in CLEC-2-deficient mice. Our findings show that KCG induces platelet activation via CLEC-2.",

The framework consists of gallic acid functionalized copper oxide nanoparticles (Ga@CuO) loaded with paclitaxel (PTX). To control the release of PTX, Ga@CuO NPs were coated with a red seaweed, Kappa carrageenan (K-carr) layer, and embellished with folic acid (FA) to enhance the targeted chemotherapy approach. Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of PTX loaded Ga@CuO@K-carr/FA NPs were estimated to be 84.58 ± 1.85 % and 13.2 ± 0.22 %, respectively. Moreover, the presence of strong cytotoxicity with an IC50 value of 12 ± 2.0 μg/mL and a high percentage of apoptotic cells (40.25 %) within the treated MCF-7 cells provided further evidence of the effective release of PTX from the loaded Ga@CuO@K-carr/FA. Consequently, it was discovered that the altered metabolic activity of cancer cells and the inhibition of cell proliferation are distinct features of apoptotic cell death induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Also, it was noted that treatment of MCF-7 cells with Ga@CuO-PTX@K-carr/FA caused a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential that resulted in cellular apoptosis. Taken together, this study sheds light on the rational design of Ga@CuO-PTX@K-carr/FA, which offers a suitable candidate to transport drugs at an intracellular level for targeted chemotherapy.",

The as-prepared PPEKC aerogel possessed a robust structure and good compressible resilience. As expected, this aerogel presented remarkable efficacy in eliminating both anionic and cationic dyes. The experimental maximum adsorption capacities were 2016.7 mg g-1 for congo red (CR) at pH = 5 and 1176.6 mg g-1 for methylene blue (MEB) at pH = 11, following with ultra-fast adsorption rates. The adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption isotherms exhibited a stronger alignment with the Langmuir isotherm model for CR at 308 K and MEB at 288, 298, 308 K. The Freundlich isotherm model yielded a suitable fit for the adsorption of CR at 288 and 298 K. Thermodynamic analyses indicated that the removal of CR and MEB was spontaneous and endothermic. The adsorption mechanisms involved electrostatic interactions, π-π interactions, and hydrogen bonds. Intriguingly, it could achieve bidirectional selective adsorption of anionic and cationic dyes in the designed pH values, due to pH-tunable surface charge. Additionally, it also exhibited favorable reusability and antibacterial activity. Therefore, the as-prepared PPEKC aerogel could be a promising biosorbent for dye wastewater treatment."

In addition, algae species are a potential reservoir of metabolites and polymers with potential to be utilized for biomedicine, healthcare and industrial purposes. Carrageenan is one such medicinally and industrially significant polysaccharide which is extracted from red algae species (Kappaphycus alvarezii and Eucheuma denticulatum, among the common species). The extraction process of carrageenan is affected by different environmental factors and the source of biomass, which can vary and significantly impact the yield. Diverse applications of carrageenan include hydrogel beads, bio-composites, pharmacological properties, application in cosmetics, food and related industries. Carrageenan biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antitumor activities are significantly influenced by sulfation pattern, yield percentage and molecular weight. In addition to natural biomedical potential of carrageenan, synergetic effect of carrageenan- nanocomposites exhibit potential for further improvisation of biomedical applications. Nanotechnology driven bio-composites of carrageenan remarkably improve the quality of films, food packaging, and drug delivery systems. Such nano bio-composites exhibit enhanced stability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, making them suitable alternatives for drug delivery, wound-healing, and tissue engineering applications. The present work is a comprehensive study to analyze biomedical and other applications of Carrageenan along with underlying mechanism or mode of action along with synergetic application of nanotechnology.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Animal models have provided some evidence of the pro-inflammatory effects of the commonly used emulsifier carrageenan. However, the effects of food-grade carrageenan among people with ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study comparing high molecular carrageenan and oat-based beta-glucan preparation (placebo) among patients (n = 7) with quiescent UC was performed. Primary endpoint was Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) at the end of the treatment (7th day). Secondary analyses included biochemical biomarkers of inflammation, intestinal permeability, detoxification of intestinal lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and gastrointestinal symptoms measured by visual analog scale. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in SCCAI or any biochemical markers between carrageenan and placebo periods, nor were there any significant differences when comparing either period to baseline. Gastrointestinal symptoms were higher during the placebo period; the sum of all symptoms and borborygmi was statistically significantly higher at the end of the placebo period than at the end of the carrageenan period (20.8 ± 18.6 vs. 13.3 ± 16.4; P = 0.031, and 29.7 ± 28.6 vs. 17.9 ± 23.6; P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that at least short-term usage of food-grade carrageenan is safe among people with UC, but given the limitations of the current study, robust human studies are still urgently needed."

Participants collected nasal swabs when symptomatic. Results: Regular daily carrageenan prophylaxis resulted in consistent but nonsignificant reductions in URTI symptoms versus the placebo group. Saline placebo decreased and increased some cold symptoms compared with no treatment. Conclusion: Daily prophylactic administration of antiviral carrageenan may not significantly reduce URTI symptoms. Due to low compliance, use in a population with specific reasons to avoid URTIs may be more appropriate. Disease-specific outcomes may be more useful than symptom reporting.",

      "abstract": "Oral cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Oral precancerous lesions (OPL) are the precursors of oral cancer, with varying degrees of progression. Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) is a major metabolite of curcumin with superior anticancer properties against various types of cancer. However, THC's clinical outcome is limited by its poor aqueous solubility. Herein, we developed novel mucoadhesive biopolymer-based composite sponges for buccal delivery of THC, exploiting nanotechnology and mucoadhesion for efficient prevention and treatment of oral cancer. Firstly, THC-nanocrystals (THC-NC) were formulated and characterized for subsequent loading into mucoadhesive composite sponges. The anticancer activity of THC-NC was assessed on a human tongue squamous carcinoma cell line (SCC-4). Finally, the chemopreventive activity of THC-NC loaded sponges (THC-NC-S) was examined in DMBA-induced hamster OPL. The selected THC-NC exhibited a particle size of 532.68 ± 13.20 nm and a zeta potential of -46.08 ± 1.12 mV. Moreover, THC-NC enhanced the anticancer effect against SCC-4 with an IC50 value of 80 µg/mL. THC-NC-S exhibited good mucoadhesion properties (0.24 ± 0.02 N) with sustained drug release, where 90% of THC was released over 4 days. Furthermore, THC-NC-S had a magnificent potential for maintaining high chemopreventive activity, as demonstrated by significant regression in the dysplasia degree and a decline in cyclin D1 (control: 40.4 ± 12.5, THC-NC-S: 12.07 ± 5.2), culminating in significant amelioration after 25 days of treatment. Conclusively, novel THC-NC-S represent a promising platform for local therapy of OPL, preventing their malignant transformation into cancer.",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common chronic neurodegenerative disease, characterized by cognitive and memory impairment accompanied by nerve cell damage. Microglia activation causing enhancement of proinflammatory effects and neurotoxicity is one of the early events in AD disease. In this study, whether KOS have therapeutic or preventive effects in the AD model prepared from APP/PS1 transgenic mice was determined. Learning and memory of AD mice were detected by water maze experiments, and microglial activation-related protein expression and deposition of APP and Aβ1-42 in the brain were examined. The effects of KOS on expressed inflammatory factors and inflammation-related proteins by microglia were tested by cell experiments. Transwell coculture was used to investigate the effect of microglia on neural cell activity after KOS treatment. The results showed that KOS could relieve the clinical symptoms in AD mice, and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory factors and inflammation-related proteins in brain tissue was detected. KOS alleviated nerve cell apoptosis by inhibiting the overactivation of microglia, thus exhibiting neuroprotective effects. Exploring the protective effect of KOS inhibition of microglia inflammation is expected to provide a theoretical basis for KOS as a therapeutic drug for neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Jellyfish venoms have long been recognized as a potentially rich source of natural bioactive compounds with pharmacological potential for the creation of innovative drugs. Our previous study demonstrated that Nemopilema nomurai jellyfish venom (NnV) has a chymotrypsin-like serine protease with fibrinolytic activity in vitro. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the potential effect of NnV on cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC; A7r5 cells) involved in the probable mechanism pathways. We also determined its anti-thrombotic effect through κ-carrageenan-induced Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat tail thrombus model. NnV inhibits on Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-stimulated A7r5 cells migration and proliferation by decreasing matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) level and phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in a dose-dependent manner, but not p38. Furthermore, NnV regulates the phenotype transition of differentiation in PDGF-BB-stimulated A7r5 cells via ɑ-SMA and calponin in a dose-dependent manner. In an in vivo study, NnV treatment demonstrated clear anti-thrombotic activity in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with decreased thrombus formation and length in κ-carrageenan-induced SD rat tail. These findings suggested that NnV has a novel fibrinolytic enzyme that can be used to prevent and/or treat thrombosis-related cardiovascular disorders.",

      "abstract": "Cell sheet tissue engineering requires prolonged in vitro culture for the development of implantable devices. Unfortunately, lengthy in vitro culture is associated with cell phenotype loss and substantially higher cost of goods, which collectively hinder clinical translation and commercialisation of tissue engineered medicines. Although macromolecular crowding has been shown to enhance and accelerate extracellular matrix deposition, whilst maintaining cellular phenotype, the optimal macromolecular crowding agent still remains elusive. Herein, we evaluated the biophysical properties of seven different carrageenan molecules at five different concentrations and their effect on human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cell morphology, viability, metabolic activity, proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition and surface marker expression. All types of carrageenan (CR) assessed demonstrated a hydrodynamic radius increase as a function of increasing concentration; high polydispersity; and negative charge. Two iota CRs were excluded from further analysis due to poor solubility in cell culture. Among the remaining five carrageenans, the lambda medium viscosity type at concentrations of 10 and 50 μg/ml did not affect cell morphology, viability, metabolic activity, proliferation and expression of surface markers and significantly increased the deposition of collagen types I, III and IV, fibronectin and laminin. Our data highlight the potential of lambda medium viscosity carrageenan as a macromolecular crowding agent for the accelerated development of functional tissue engineered medicines.",
