      "abstract": "High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity represents a significant challenge to male reproductive health, affecting approximately 13% of the global adult population. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence regarding mulberry (Morus alba L.) fruit extract's therapeutic potential for HFD-induced male reproductive dysfunction. Through comprehensive analysis of the peer-reviewed literature from multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar; 2005-2024), we evaluated mulberry extract's effects on testicular morphology, spermatogenesis, sperm parameters, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mechanistic studies reveal that standardized mulberry extract mediates protective effects through multiple pathways: enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD: +45%, Catalase: +38%, GPx: +35%), reduced inflammatory markers (TNF-α: -64%, IL-6: -58%), and modulated NF-κB signaling (-42.3%). These effects are facilitated by mulberry's rich phytochemical profile, particularly anthocyanins (2.92-5.35 mg/g dry weight) and polyphenols (4.23-6.38 mg/g). The extract demonstrates particular efficacy in preserving seminiferous tubule integrity and maintaining blood-testis barrier function, with treated groups maintaining up to 85% of normal tubular architecture compared to HFD controls. Key molecular mechanisms include AMPK/SIRT1 pathway activation (2.3-fold increase), enhanced mitochondrial function (67% increase in mtDNA copy number), and epigenetic regulation of metabolic pathways. Temporal analysis indicates optimal therapeutic effects after 28 days of treatment, with initial improvements observable within 14 days. While current evidence is promising, limitations include predominant reliance on rodent models and lack of standardized extraction protocols. Future research priorities include well-designed human clinical trials, standardization of preparation methods, and investigation of potential synergistic effects with other therapeutic agents. This comprehensive review indicates that mulberry extract is a promising therapeutic candidate for obesity-related male infertility, warranting further clinical investigation.",

      "abstract": "Extracts of mulberry have been shown to reduce post-prandial glucose (PPG) and insulin (PPI) responses, but reliability of these effects and required doses and specifications are unclear. We previously found that 1·5 g of a specified mulberry fruit extract (MFE) significantly reduced PPG and PPI responses to 50 g carbohydrate as rice porridge, with no indications of intolerance. The trials reported here aimed to replicate that work and assess the efficacy of lower MFE doses, using boiled rice as the carbohydrate source. Two separate randomised controlled intervention studies were carried out with healthy Indian males and females aged 20-50 years (n 84 per trial), with PPG area under the curve over 2 h as the primary outcome. Trial 1 used doses of 0, 0·37, 0·75, 1·12 and 1·5 g MFE in boiled rice and 0 or 1·5 g MFE in rice porridge. Trial 2 used doses of 0, 0·04, 0·12, 0·37 g MFE in boiled rice. In trial 1, relative to control, all MFE doses significantly decreased PPG (-27·2 to -22·9 %; all P ≤ 0·02) and PPI (-34·6 to -14·0 %, all P < 0·01). Breath hydrogen was significantly increased only at 1·5 g MFE (in rice porridge), and self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms were uniformly low. In trial 2, only 0·37 g MFE significantly affected PPG (-20·4 %, P = 0·002) and PPI (-17·0 %, P < 0·001). Together, these trials show that MFE in doses as low as 0·37 g can reliably reduce PPG and PPI responses to a carbohydrate-rich meal, with no apparent adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, always clinically manifesting with memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Over the past decade, the extensive accumulation of Aβ plaques and the related neuroinflammation such as the activation of glial cells have been frequently demonstrated to contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. However, drugs promoting Aβ plaques degradation and modulating the neuroinflammation remain undeveloped for AD treatment. Mulberry (or Morus alba Linn.) fruit, a common folk medicine, has been demonstrated to exhibit a considerable neuroprotective effect such as promoting memory impairment and enhancing cognitive ability on Parkinson's-disease-related animal models. Whether mulberry fruit can treat or alleviate AD-related symptoms are unclear so far. In the present study, we estimated the neuroprotective effects of mulberry fruit ethanol extract (MFE) using APP/PS1 transgenic mice, a widely used AD animal model. We found that daily oral MFE (100 mg/kg body weight, for 1.5-3 weeks) remarkably improved the spatial memory and learning ability of APP/PS1 mice, determined by behavioral tests including the Rotarod, Elevated plus maze and Morris water maze test. In histological, we observed that MFE reduced Aβ plaques and neuron apoptosis both in the cortex and hippocampus tissues of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, MFE treatment noticeably alleviated the neuroinflammation, indicated by the decreased number of astrocytes in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. These results were further confirmed by the elevation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4) and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) in the cortex and hippocampus tissues of MFE-treated APP/PS1 mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that MFE exhibits a good neuroprotective effect on APP/PS1 mice. Therefore, MFE may be a promising therapeutic drug in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, especially like AD.",

      "abstract": "Mulberry is known to have pharmacological effects against cholesterol, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Many studies have revealed that mulberry leaf possesses hepatoprotective properties against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, mulberry fruit is less studied in this context. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the preventive effects of mulberry fruit against high fat diet- (HFD-) induced NAFLD. To evaluate the effects of mulberry fruit on NAFLD, two doses of mulberry fruit ethanol extracts [MB, 100, and 200 mg/kg BW (body weight)] were given to HFD-fed rats for 10 weeks. MB dramatically prevented liver damage as shown by biochemical analysis of the liver injury markers, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase. MB treatment significantly inhibited the increased levels of total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol but restored the level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in HFD-fed rats. Notably, histological analysis of liver tissues demonstrated that MB substantially ameliorated lipid accumulation. Expression of cholesterol-regulating genes was also suppressed by MB treatment. For its underlying mechanisms, MB suppressed hepatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and mitochondrial oxidative stress in HFD-fed rats. MB potentially protects liver tissue against NAFLD by inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative stress, suggesting its possible use as a therapeutic agent for treatment of NAFLD."

      "abstract": "Ethyl carbamate (EC) is a food and environmental toxicant and is a cause of concern for human exposure. Several studies indicated that EC-induced toxicity was associated with oxidative stress. Mulberry fruits are reported to have a wide range of bioactive compounds and pharmacological activities. The present study was therefore aimed to investigate the protective property of mulberry fruit extract (MFE) on EC-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Chemical composition analysis showed that total phenolic content and total flavonoid content in MFE were 502.43 ± 5.10 and 219.12 ± 4.45 mg QE/100 g FW. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside were the major anthocyanins in MFE. In vitro antioxidant studies (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays) jointly exhibited the potent antioxidant capacity of MFE. Further study indicated that MFE protected human liver HepG2 cells from EC-induced cytotoxicity by scavenging overproduced cellular ROS. EC treatment promoted intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion and caused mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, as well as mitochondrial membrane lipid peroxidation, whereas MFE pretreatment significantly inhibited GSH depletion and restored the mitochondrial membrane function. Overall, our study suggested that polyphenolic-rich MFE could afford a potent protection against EC-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress.",

This has clinical implications in the onset of type 1 diabetes, which is triggered by the destruction of pancreatic β-cells and is associated with oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the protective and antioxidative effects of mulberry extract (ME) in insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. We found that ME protects pancreatic β-cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress and the associated apoptotic cell death. ME treatment significantly reduced the levels of H2O2-induced 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, and lipid peroxidation and intracellular ROS accumulation. In addition, ME inhibited DNA condensation and/or fragmentation induced by H2O2. These results suggest that ME protects pancreatic β-cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress.",
