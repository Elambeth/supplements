      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is common in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). There is an urgent need to identify/develop novel therapies that can help cognitive function in MS. Insulin is critical for helping with regulation of multiple CNS functions, including learning and memory. Insulin administrated intranasally has shown to improve memory and learning in healthy people and in those with some neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, there was rationale for investigating intranasal insulin in PwMS who experience cognitive impairment. We completed a phase Ib/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial; participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion, stratified by relapsing versus progressive MS, to intranasal insulin 10 ​international units (IU) twice a day, 20 IU twice a day, or placebo for 24 weeks. One-hundred and five PwMS were enrolled, 69 of whom had at least one follow up visit during the active treatment phase of the trial (baseline to week 24). The cohort's mean age was 52.4 ​± ​9.7years, 62 ​% were female, and ∼60 ​% had relapsing-remitting MS. The most common side effects amongst treatment groups included headache, rhinorrhea, and dizziness. There were 13 SAEs which were not deemed study drug related; there were no deaths. The main clinical outcome measure, SDMT, did not demonstrate any difference between intranasal insulin and placebo. Similar findings were noted for all secondary outcome measures. Intranasal insulin appeared safe and well-tolerated in PwMS. However, it was not superior to placebo in any of the clinical outcome measures assessed, which could have been impacted by the duration of the trial, small sample size for a three-arm trial design, data missingness (particularly during COVID-19), outcome measure insensitivity to change, baseline cognitive reserve, or other factors. Nonetheless, intranasally-administered therapeutics may be of interest to develop further as a way to get across the blood brain barrier."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. Evidence suggests that AD shares pathophysiological similarities with type 2 diabetes. Intranasal insulin (INI) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for AD by directly targeting the brain and modulating insulin signaling pathways. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of INI therapy for AD through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: A search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase, was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to June 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed original research articles focused on humans, investigating the therapeutic effects of INI administration on cognitive impairment associated with AD, and reporting quantitative data on cognitive outcomes, biomarkers, or pathological markers relevant to AD. A meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively synthesize the effects of INI on cognitive outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 647 articles were identified, and eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall odds ratio was 3.75 (95%CI 1.49-9.40). The test for overall effect showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). However, the I2 value indicated a high level of heterogeneity (85.5%), suggesting significant variability among the studies. CONCLUSION: While the current data is not yet conclusive enough to definitively establish INI as a standard treatment for AD, the evidence supporting its safety, efficacy, and reduced risk of systemic side effects suggests potential cognitive benefits for improving global cognition in patients with AD."

      "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction has emerged as a prominent symptom of post viral (COVID 19) rhinitis, persisting in a subset of patients even after recovery. Insulin (IN)receptors are found in the olfactory mucosa, and it has been noticed that IN treatment promotes olfactory sensory neuron regeneration, so it is included in the list of possible methods for treating olfactory impairment. To compare the effect of intranasal insulin films on improving post viral olfactory dysfunction in one group of patients and improving the prepared formulation by addition of another active ingredient (Budesonide) and study the percentage of recovery from this combination on another group of patients. The study included 250 patients of both sexes with post viral (COVID 19) olfactory dysfunction and divided into 2 groups Group A (n = 125 patients) received 100 IU of insulin combined with 10 mg budesonide and Group B (125 patients) received 100 IU of insulin only. Olfactory improvement in both groups after intranasal insulin fast dissolving film application were observed, olfactory scores were recorded in the group which received combined films containing Budesonide added to the insulin, signifying the important role of Budesonide together with insulin in improving Post viral olfactory dysfunction. Intranasal insulin therapy is a viable technique to treating post viral olfactory impairment since it improves both olfactory threshold and discrimination. Furthermore, combining Budesonide with insulin in the unique fast dissolving intranasal films produced significantly better results (p value < 0.001) in the therapy of post viral olfactory dysfunction."

This phase I, open-label adaptive dose-escalation study explores the maximum tolerated dose of intranasal insulin in healthy human participants. Placebo or insulin at doses from 0 to 1000 units was given to healthy participants intranasally on repeated weekly visits. Serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were measured serially at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after administration. Twenty-four participants (12 female, median age 53, IQR 35-61) were enrolled. There was minimal change in average serum glucose after administration of intranasal insulin. Average serum insulin increased slightly in a dose-dependent manner, reaching maximum concentrations at 15 min. C-peptide decreased over time from administration in all groups. One participant had severe hypoglycemia (24 mg/dL at 45 min) and a different participant had mild hypoglycemia (51 mg/dL at 30 min), both after receiving 600 U intranasal insulin. Hypoglycemic episodes were associated with increases in serum insulin. Both participants continued in the study without hypoglycemia after additional doses. High-dose intranasal insulin up to 1000 U was generally well tolerated, with minimal measurable systemic absorption and without significant aggregate changes in mean glucose. Idiosyncratic episodic systemic absorption and hypoglycemia require further study and additional caution in potential clinical application. Further study of its target engagement and efficacy as a neuroprotective therapy after cardiac arrest at these doses is warranted.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a prevalent nasal affliction that has detrimental effects on the patients' quality of life and safety. Conventional therapeutic strategies have various limitations such as high costs, prolonged treatment durations and adverse side effects. Intranasal insulin is a novel intervention for the management of OD. To date, few systematic reviews have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention. This study aims to critically assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of intranasal insulin administration in patients with OD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic literature search will be performed on several databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, SinoMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), to identify studies investigating the efficacy of intranasal insulin in treating OD. The search will span from database inception to 1 April 2024, including publication in Chinese and English languages. Data will be retrieved from the literature by two independent investigators. Subsequently, the data will be processed using RevMan V.5.3.5. The meta-analysis will be performed in line with the Cochrane Handbook guidelines. The clinical efficacy and safety of intranasal insulin for OD will be appraised based on various outcomes, including overall symptom improvement, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center score, variations in serum glucose levels, body mass index variations and the incidence of adverse events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This will be a systematic review of available literature; thus, no ethical clearance is required. The results of this study will be shared through journal publication or presented at an academic conference. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: According to the guidelines, our systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 16 May 2024 (registration number CRD42024543438).",

This scoping review aims to explore the potential of intranasal insulin as a treatment modality for persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to gather relevant studies examining the role of intranasal insulin in treating olfactory dysfunction, particularly in post-COVID-19 cases. Studies were included investigating intranasal insulin's mechanisms, efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes. The review synthesizes findings from various studies suggesting the therapeutic potential of intranasal insulin in improving olfactory function. Research highlights the influence of intranasal insulin on neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity within the olfactory system, providing insights into its mechanisms of action. Furthermore, preliminary clinical evidence suggests improvements in olfactory sensitivity and intensity following intranasal insulin administration in post-COVID-19 patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction. While initial findings are encouraging, further rigorous investigations, including clinical trials with larger cohorts, are essential to validate these observations, ascertain optimal dosage regimens, and establish the safety and efficacy of intranasal insulin. This review provides a foundation for future research directions aimed at harnessing the therapeutic potential of intranasal insulin in addressing olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19."

We studied how intranasal insulin impacts memory and neural oscillations in an Alzheimer's disease rat model induced by STZ. MAIN METHODS: Male Wistar rats were intracerebroventricularly injected with STZ, followed by intranasal insulin therapy. Electrophysiological recordings were conducted in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex to assess local field potentials. Memory was assessed using novel object recognition and Y-maze tests. Amyloid and tau pathology and neuronal loss were also evaluated in the hippocampus. KEY FINDING: Alterations in theta-gamma oscillations following insulin treatment were not significant. However, insulin administration ameliorated hippocampal sharp-wave ripples deficit and augmented hippocampal-prefrontal theta coherence. Concurrently, insulin therapy enhanced spatial memory and object recognition memory performance in behavioral tests. Insulin mitigated tau and amyloid pathology and hippocampal neuronal loss. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings underscore the potential of intranasal insulin to enhance memory function by modulating hippocampal-prefrontal cortical synchronization and alleviating impairments in hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive impairment are common neural complications in older surgical patients and exacerbate the burden of medical care on families and society. METHODS: A total of 140 older patients who were scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery or pancreatic surgery with general anaesthesia were randomly assigned to Group S or Group I with a 1:1 allocation. Patients in Group S and Group I received intranasal administration of 400 μL of normal saline or 40 IU/400 μL of insulin, respectively, once daily from 5 minutes before anaesthesia induction until 3 days postoperatively. Perioperative cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B) at 1 day before and 3 days after surgery and postoperative delirium (POD) incidence was assessed using the 3-minute Diagnostic Interview for CAM (3D-CAM) on postoperative days 1-3. Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), S100-β and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on the first day after surgery. RESULTS: Insulin treatment significantly increased postoperative MMSE and MoCA-B scores in group I than in group S (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, respectively), decreased the incidence of POD within the 3-day postoperative period in Group I than in Group S (10.9% vs 26.6%, P = 0.024), and inhibited postoperative IL-6 and S100-β levels in Group I compared to Group S (P = 0.034, P = 0.044, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal insulin administration is thus suggested as a potential therapy to improve postoperative cognition in older patients undergoing surgery. However, a more standardized multi-centre, large-sample study is needed to further validate these results.",

Some of these include the genetic predisposition of the apolipoprotein E4 genotype, consuming a high-fat diet (HFD), and the female sex. Brain insulin receptor resistance and deficiency have also been shown to be associated with AD and cognitive impairment. Intranasal (INL) insulin enhances cognition in AD, but the response varies due to genotype, diet, and sex. We investigated here the combination of these risk factors in a humanized mouse model, expressing E3 or E4, following a HFD in males and females on cognitive performance and the brain distribution of insulin following INL delivery. The HFD had a negative effect on survival in male mice only, requiring sex to be collapsed. We found many genotype, diet, and genotype x diet effects in anxiety-related tasks. We further found beneficial effects of INL insulin in our memory tests, with the most important findings showing a beneficial effect of INL insulin in mice on a HFD. We found insulin distribution throughout the brain after INL delivery was largely unaffected by diet and genotype, indicating these susceptible groups can still receive adequate levels of insulin following INL delivery. Our findings support the involvement of brain insulin signaling in cognition and highlight continuing efforts investigating mechanisms resulting from treatment with INL insulin.",

Preoperative sleep disturbance is a risk factor for POD development, and nasal insulin modulates the sleep-wake cycle. This study investigated the beneficial effects of intranasal insulin pretreatment on preoperative sleep quality and reducing POD in patients undergoing valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 76 adult patients aged 18-65 years undergoing valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass who were randomly allocated to receive intranasal insulin or normal saline interventions two days before surgery. POD incidence was on postoperative days 1 (T3), 2 (T4), and 3 (T5). Before the first intervention (T0), 1 d before surgery (T1), and before anesthesia on the day of surgery (T2), sleep quality was assessed and serum cortisol concentrations were measured. At T1 and T2, sleep quality related indicators monitored by sleep monitoring watches from the previous night were recorded. RESULTS: Compared with the normal saline group, 3 days after surgery, the insulin group showed a significantly reduced incidence of POD; significantly increased deep sleep, REM sleep, deep sleep continuity, and total sleep quality scores at T1 and T2; and significantly reduced serum cortisol concentration, PSQI scale, light sleep ratio, and wakefulness at T1 and T2. CONCLUSION: The administration of 20 U of intranasal insulin twice daily, from 2 days preoperatively until 10 minutes preanesthesia on the day of surgery, can improved preoperative sleep quality significantly and reduced POD incidence in patients with rheumatic heart disease undergoing valve replacement. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn, with the unique identifier ChiCTR2100048515; July 9, 2021)."

This study examined whether intranasal delivery of insulin (INI) at low (0.875 U) or high (1.750 U) doses would ameliorate these deficits compared to saline in 10-month-old female 5xFAD and B6SJL wildtype (WT) mice. INI increased forelimb grip strength in the wire hang test in 5xFAD mice in a dose-dependent manner but did not improve the performance of 5xFAD mice on the balance beam. High INI doses reduced frailty scores in 5xFAD mice and improved spatial memory in both acquisition and reversal probe trials in the Morris water maze. INI increased swim speed in 5xFAD mice but had no effect on object recognition memory or working memory in the spontaneous alternation task, nor did it improve memory in the contextual or cued fear memory tasks. High doses of insulin increased the liver, spleen, and kidney weights and reduced brown adipose tissue weights. P-Akt signaling in the hippocampus was increased by insulin in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether, INI increased strength, reduced frailty scores, and improved visual spatial memory. Hypoglycemia was not present after INI, however alterations in tissue and organ weights were present. These results are novel and important as they indicate that intra-nasal insulin can reverse cognitive, motor and frailty deficits found in this mouse model of AD.",

The rats were divided randomly into the following five groups (n = 10): Sham, TBI, TBI with HT treatment for 3 h (TBI + HT), TBI with INS (ten microliters of insulin) treatment daily for 7 days (TBI + INS), and TBI with combining HT and INS (TBI + HT + INS). At the end of the 7th day, the open field and the Morris water maze tests were done for evaluation of anxiety-like behavior and memory performance. Then, after sacrificing, the brain was removed for stereological study. TBI led to an increase in the total volume of hippocampal subfields CA1 and DG and a decrease in the total number of neurons and non-neuronal cells in both sub-regions, which was associated with anxiety-like behavior and memory impairment. Although, the combination of HT and INS prevented the increased hippocampal volume and cell loss and improved behavioral performances in the TBI group. Our study suggests that the combined treatment of HT and INS could prevent increased hippocampal volume and cell loss in CA1 and DG sub-regions and consequently improve anxiety-like behaviors and memory impairment following TBI.",

Despite these medicinal effects, they have the drawback of causing metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance etc., which is known to be a key indicator of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a major predisposing factor to type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy. This study was designed to compare and evaluate the effects of saxagliptin, metformin and intranasal insulin (when used singly or in combination) on dexamethasone induced insulin resistance. Fifty-six female rats were randomly assigned into eight groups. Group 1 represented the control; Group 2 was administered with dexamethasone (1mg/kg) (untreated); Group 3 received dexamethasone + intranasal insulin (2IU); Group 4 received dexamethasone + intranasal insulin + metformin (40mg/kg); Group 5; received dexamethasone + intranasal + saxagliptin (8mg/kg); Group 6 received dexamethasone + metformin (40mg/kg); Group 7 received dexamethasone + saxagliptin (8mg/kg); Group 8 received dexamethasone + saxagliptin(8mg/kg) + metformin(40mg/kg). Treatments were given for one week. At the end of the study, blood samples were collected for biochemical assays and pancreas excised for histological examination. Dexamethasone (1mg/kg) induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance and disrupted the structural integrity of the pancreas. Treatment with saxagliptin, metformin and their combination significantly decreased blood glucose level, decreased LDL Level and improved glucose tolerance. The selected hypoglycemic agents used in present study ameliorate the dexamethasone induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance of which the combination of metformin with saxagliptin showed greater efficacy.",

New evidence suggests that insulin could be neuroprotective. This study aimed to investigate whether intranasal insulin attenuates HI-induced brain damage and neurobehavioral dysfunction in neonatal rats. Postnatal day 10 (P10), Sprague-Dawley rat pups were randomly divided into Sham + Vehicle, Sham + Insulin, HI + Vehicle, and HI + Insulin groups with equal male-to-female ratios. Pups either had HI by permanent ligation of the right common carotid artery followed by 90 min of hypoxia (8% O2) or sham surgery followed by room air exposure. Immediately after HI or Sham, pups were given fluorescence-tagged insulin (Alex-546-insulin)/vehicle, human insulin (25 μg), or vehicle in each nare under anesthesia. Shortly after administration, widespread Alex-546-insulin-binding cells were detected in the brain, primarily co-localized with neuronal nuclei-positive neurons on double-immunostaining. In the hippocampus, phospho-Akt was activated in a subset of Alex-546-insulin double-labeled cells, suggesting activation of the Akt/PI3K pathway in these neurons. Intranasal insulin (InInsulin) reduced HI-induced sensorimotor behavioral disturbances at P11. InInsulin prevented HI-induced increased Fluoro-Jade C+ degenerated neurons, cleaved caspase 3+ neurons, and volume loss in the ipsilateral brain at P11. There was no sex-specific response to HI or insulin. The findings confirm that intranasal insulin provides neuroprotection against HI brain injury in P10 rats associated with activation of intracellular cell survival signaling. If further pre-clinical research shows long-term benefits, intranasal insulin has the potential to be a promising non-invasive therapy to improve outcomes for newborns with HIE."

Since both INI and dulaglutide have beneficial effects on the cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we anticipate that improved CVD will underlie the hypothesized cognitive benefits. METHODS: This 12-months trial will include 80 older adults aged > 60 with MetS and MCI, randomized to 4 groups: INI/oral semaglutide, intranasal placebo/oral semaglutide, INI/oral placebo, and intranasal placebo/oral placebo. Feasibility of combining INI with semaglutide will be tested by examining the ease of use of INI (20IU, twice/day) with semaglutide (14 once daily), adherence, and safety profile are the efficacy of combination therapy on global cognition and neurobiological markers: cerebral blood flow, cerebral glucose utilization, white matter hyperintensities, Alzheimer's related blood biomarkers and expression of insulin signaling proteins measured in brain-derived exosomes. Efficacy will be assessed for the intent-to-treat sample. DISCUSSION: This feasibility study is anticipated to provide the basis for a multi-center large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the cognitive benefits of the combination of INI with semaglutide in individuals enriched for CVD and at high dementia risk.",

We investigated the possible protective effect of intranasal insulin intake with exercise on amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced neuronal damage. The level of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) were analyzed to understand the involvement of BDNF-TrkB pathway in this modulation. In this study, we induced AD-like pathology by amyloid-β (Aβ) administration. Then, we examined the impact of a 4-week pretreatment of moderate treadmill exercise and intranasal intake of insulin on working and spatial memory in male Wistar rats. We also analyzed the mechanisms of improved memory and anxiety through changes in the protein level of BDNF and TrkB. Results showed that animals received Aβ had impaired working memory, increased anxiety which were accompanied by lower protein levels of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus. The exercise training and intranasal insulin improved working memory deficits, decreased anxiety, and increased BDNF, and TrkB levels in the hippocampus of animals received Aβ. Our finding of improved memory performance after intranasal intake of insulin and exercise may be of significance for the treatment of memory impairments and anxiety-like behavior in AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Quantitative (hyposmia and anosmia) and qualitative (phantosmia and parosmia) olfactory disorders are common consequences of COVID-19 infection found in more than 38% of patients even months after resolution of acute disease. SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the respiratory system, suggesting that it is the mechanism of damage to the olfactory neuroepithelium and of involvement at the central nervous system. The olfactory bulb is the organ with the highest insulin uptake in the central nervous system. Insulin increases the production of Growth Factors (GF); therefore, in this study, the administration of intranasal insulin is proposed as a viable treatment for olfactory disturbances. The aim of this study was to obtain improvement in olfaction after 4 weeks of intranasal insulin administration in a group of patients presenting chronic olfactory disturbances secondary to COVID-19 infection, quantified using the Threshold, Discrimination, and Identification (TDI) score based on the Sniffin Sticks®. METHODS: Experimental, longitudinal, prolective and prospective study of patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 in the last 3-18 months and who persisted with anosmia or hyposmia. The sample size was calculated with \"satulator\". The intervention was performed from January to May 2022. Throughout four appointments, a baseline olfactory measurement was obtained using the TDI score based on the Sniffin Sticks® test. In the first three appointments, Gelfoam® cottonoids soaked in 40 IU of NPH insulin were placed on the nasal roof of each nostril for 15 min. Descriptive statistics, student's paired t test and a multiple linear regression were utilized to ascertain statistical significance of the outcome on the TDI score obtained on the fourth and final appointment. RESULTS: 27 patients were included in the study. Table 1 summarizes the sample characteristics. The results exhibit that 93% of the sample had an improvement. The initial mean TDI score was 67% (63-71) compared to the final mean of 83% (80-86, p < 0.01). TDI subsection analysis is shown in Table 2. There was no significant difference in pre-intervention and post-intervention glucose measurements after the intranasal insulin administration. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of intranasal insulin has promising results, pointing towards an alternative of treatment for chronic olfactory disturbances secondary to neuroepithelial damage caused by upper respiratory tract infections. Furthermore, this is the first study to use a three-point assessment of olfaction in post-COVID-19 patients, while using the Sniffin Sticks® TDI score adapted to Latin Spanish.",

To objective was to assess the effects of intranasal insulin administration intranasal insulin administration on the hippocampal transcriptome in a developing rat model of perinatal FeD. Perinatal FeD was induced using low-iron diet from gestational day 3 until postnatal day (P) 7, followed by an iron sufficient (FeS) diet through P21. Intranasal insulin was administered at a dose of 0.3 IU twice daily from P8 to P21. Hippocampi were removed on P21 from FeS control, FeD control, FeS insulin, and FeD insulin groups. Total RNA was isolated and profiled using next-generation sequencing. Gene expression profiles were characterized using custom workflows and expression patterns examined using ingenuity pathways analysis (n = 7-9 per group). Select RNAseq results were confirmed via qPCR. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that mitochondrial biogenesis and flux, oxidative phosphorylation, quantity of neurons, CREB signaling in neurons, and RICTOR-based mTOR signaling were disrupted with FeD and positively affected by intranasal insulin treatment with the most benefit observed in the FeD insulin group. Both perinatal FeD and intranasal insulin administration altered gene expression profile in the developing hippocampus. Intranasal insulin treatment reversed the adverse effects of FeD on many molecular pathways and could be explored as an adjunct therapy in perinatal FeD.",

METHODS: A literature search was conducted for PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception until August 2022. Documents were screened for qualified articles, and all concerned outcomes were pooled as risk ratios or mean difference (MD) in the meta-analysis models using Review Manager (RevMan version 5.4). RESULTS: Our results from 12 studies favored intranasal insulin over placebo in terms of Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) 20 IU, (MD = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.22, -0.05], P = 0.003). The overall effect did not favor either of the two groups for ADAS-cog 40 IU, memory composite 20 IU and 40 IU, and adverse events (MD = -0.08, 95% CI [-0.16, 0.01], P = 0.08), (MD = 0.65, 95% CI [-0.08, 1.39], P = 0.08), (MD = 0.25, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.6], P = 0.15), and (MD = 1.28, 95% CI [0.75, 2.21], P = 0.36), respectively. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, this meta-analysis showed that intranasal insulin in small doses (20 IU) significantly affects patients with AD. Further studies are recommended on reliable insulin delivery devices to increase insulin in the central nervous system. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Intranasal insulin has shown promising results in treating patients with AD. The lower doses (20 IU) can play a positive role in improving the disease. As research continues, it is likely that this treatment will become more widely accepted and utilized in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Intranasal insulin (IN) administration is a promising way to deliver the peptide to the central nervous system (CNS), bypassing the blood-brain-barrier and gastrointestinal absorption inhibition. IN receptors are localized in the olfactory mucosa and the brain, mainly in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. The pleiotropic mechanism of insulin action is characterized by its anti-inflammatory properties, antithrombotic, vasodilatory, and antiapoptotic effects. It prevents energy failure and has regenerative properties, affects neuro-regeneration and counteracts insulin resistance. Hence, insulin has been suggested for various pathological states including neurocognitive disorders, obesity, and as a therapeutic option for smell loss. A sharply increased prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was observed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also emphasized the lack of therapeutic options for smell loss. Intranasal insulin administration has therefore been suggested to serve as potential treatment, influencing the regenerative capacities of the olfactory mucosa. This narrative review summarizes current knowledge on possible effects of intranasal insulin on the sense of smell."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aberrant brain insulin signaling has been posited to lie at the crossroads of several metabolic and cognitive disorders. Intranasal insulin (INI) is a non-invasive approach that allows investigation and modulation of insulin signaling in the brain while limiting peripheral side effects. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effects of INI on cognition in diverse patient populations and healthy individuals. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL were systematically searched from 2000 to July 2021. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that studied the effects of INI on cognition. Two independent reviewers determined study eligibility and extracted relevant descriptive and outcome data. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (pooled N = 1,726) in healthy individuals as well as those with Alzheimer's disease (AD)/mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, among others, were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. Patients with AD/MCI treated with INI were more likely to show an improvement in global cognition (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.38 p = <0.00001, N = 12 studies). Among studies with healthy individuals and other patient populations, no significant effects of INI were found for global cognition. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates that INI may be associated with pro-cognitive benefits for global cognition, specifically for individuals with AD/MCI. Further studies are required to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms and differences in etiology to dissect the intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to the treatment response of INI.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Insulin has an effect on neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role and mechanism of insulin in vascular dementia (VD) and its underlying mechanism are unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of insulin on VD. Methods: Experimental rats were randomly assigned to control (CK), Sham, VD, and insulin (INS) + VD groups. Insulin was administered by intranasal spray. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris's water maze. Nissl's staining and immunohistochemical staining were used to assess morphological alterations. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL-staining. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), respectively. Results: Insulin significantly improved cognitive and memory functions in VD model rats (p < 0.05). Compared with the VD group, the insulin + VD group exhibited significantly reduced the number of Nissl's bodies numbers, apoptosis level, GFAP-positive cell numbers, apoptosis rates, and p-tau and tau levels in the hippocampal CA1 region (p < 0.05). Transcriptomic analysis found 1,257 and 938 DEGs in the VD vs. CK and insulin + VD vs. VD comparisons, respectively. The DEGs were mainly enriched in calcium signaling, cAMP signaling, axon guidance, and glutamatergic synapse signaling pathways. In addition, metabolomic analysis identified 1 and 14 DEMs between groups in negative and positive modes, respectively. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that DEGs and DEMs were mostly enriched in metabolic pathway. Conclusion: Insulin could effectively improve cognitive function in VD model rats by downregulating tau and p-tau expression, inhibiting astrocyte inflammation and neuron apoptosis, and regulating genes involved in calcium signaling, cAMP signaling, axon guidance, and glutamatergic synapse pathways, as well as metabolites involved in metabolic pathway."

Since both INI and dulaglutide have beneficial effects on the cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we anticipate that improved CVD will underlie the hypothesized cognitive benefits. METHODS: This 12-months trial will include 80 older adults aged > 60 with MetS and MCI, randomized to 4 groups: INI/dulaglutide injection, intranasal placebo/dulaglutide injection, INI/placebo injection, and intranasal placebo/placebo injection. Feasibility of combining INI with dulaglutide will be tested by examining the ease of use of INI (20IU, twice/day) with dulaglutide (1.5 mg/week), adherence, and safety profile are the efficacy of combination therapy on global cognition and neurobiological markers: cerebral blood flow, cerebral glucose utilization, white matter hyperintensities, Alzheimer's related blood biomarkers and expression of insulin signaling proteins measured in brain-derived exosomes. Efficacy will be assessed for the intent-to-treat sample. DISCUSSION: This feasibility study is anticipated to provide the basis for a multi-center large-scale randomized clinical trial of the cognitive benefits of the combination of INI with dulaglutide in individuals enriched for CVD and at high dementia risk.",

This article suggests that curing AD may be achieved by combination therapy as follows. First, with intranasal insulin to augment the body's natural counter-reaction to the changes in brain cell-types that produced the dementia. Second, with edaravone to decrease free radicals, which are increased and causal in AD. Third, as described elsewhere, with one or two drugs from among pioglitazone, fluoxetine, and lithium, which address the brain cell-types whose changed functions cause the dementia. Insulin restores cerebral glucose, which is the main nutrient for brain neurons whose depletion is responsible for the dementia; and edaravone decreases ROS, which are intrinsic causes of neuropathology in AD. This combination of drugs is a potential cure for many patients with AD, and should be tested in a clinical trial."

In humans, studies have shown conflicting results, with some studies suggesting that intranasal insulin (INI) in relatively high doses may decrease appetite, body fat, and weight in various populations. These hypotheses have not been tested in a large longitudinal placebo-controlled study. Participants in the Memory Advancement with Intranasal Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes (MemAID) trial were enrolled in this study. This study on energy homeostasis enrolled 89 participants who completed baseline and at least 1 intervention visit (42 women; age 65 ± 9 years; 46 INI, 38 with type 2 diabetes) and 76 completed treatment (16 women, age 64 ± 9; 38 INI, 34 with type 2 diabetes). The primary outcome was the INI effect on food intake. Secondary outcomes included the effect of INI on appetite and anthropometric measures, including body weight and body composition. In exploratory analyses, we tested the interaction of treatment with gender, body mass index (BMI), and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. There was no INI effect on food intake or any of the secondary outcomes. INI also showed no differential effect on primary and secondary outcomes when considering gender, BMI, and type 2 diabetes. INI did not alter appetite or hunger nor cause weight loss when used at 40 I.U. intranasally daily for 24 weeks in older adults with and without type 2 diabetes.",

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective interventional cohort with a single group. SETTING: Sixteen volunteers with anosmia, severe hyposmia, or moderate hyposmia for more than 60 days as sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections were selected for the study. All volunteers reported that standard therapies, such as corticosteroids, have failed to improve their olfactory function. METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed by the Chemosensory Clinical Research Center test of olfaction (COT) before and after the intervention. Changes in qualitative, quantitative, and global COT scores were investigated. The insulin therapy session consisted of placing into each olfactory cleft 2 pieces of gelatin sponge soaked with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, 40 IU on each side. The procedure was repeated twice a week for 1 month. Glycaemic blood level was measured before and after each session. RESULTS: The qualitative COT score rose 1.53 points, p = .0001, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-2.12 to -0.94). The quantitative COT score increased by 2.00 points, p = .0002, 95% CI (-3.59 to -1.41). Global COT score had an improvement of 2.01 points, p = .00003, 95% CI (-2.7 to -1.3). Glycaemic blood level dropped on average 10.4 mg/dL, p < .00003, 95% CI (8.1-12.8). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the administration of NPH insulin into the olfactory cleft yields a rapid improvement in the sense of smell of patients suffering from persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. Moreover, the procedure seems to be safe and tolerable.",

      "abstract": "A decrease in the activity of the insulin signaling system of the brain, due to both central insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, leads to neurodegeneration and impaired regulation of appetite, metabolism, endocrine functions. This is due to the neuroprotective properties of brain insulin and its leading role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the brain, as well as in the regulation of the brain signaling network responsible for the functioning of the nervous, endocrine, and other systems. One of the approaches to restore the activity of the insulin system of the brain is the use of intranasally administered insulin (INI). Currently, INI is being considered as a promising drug to treat Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. The clinical application of INI is being developed for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases and improve cognitive abilities in stress, overwork, and depression. At the same time, much attention has recently been paid to the prospects of using INI for the treatment of cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injuries, and postoperative delirium (after anesthesia), as well as diabetes mellitus and its complications, including dysfunctions in the gonadal and thyroid axes. This review is devoted to the prospects and current trends in the use of INI for the treatment of these diseases, which, although differing in etiology and pathogenesis, are characterized by impaired insulin signaling in the brain.",

METHODS: The MemAID trial consisted of 12 visits during 24 weeks of intranasal insulin or placebo treatment and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up in older people with and without diabetes. Enhanced retention strategies were implemented mid study to address high drop-out rate. Baseline variables used in Cox regression models to identify dropout risk factors were: demographics and social characteristics, functional measures, metabolic and cardiovascular parameters, and medications. RESULTS: 244 participants were randomized; 13 (5.3%) were discontinued due to adverse events. From the remaining 231 randomized participants, 65 (28.1%) dropped out, and 166 (71.9%) did not. The Non-retention group included 95 participants not exposed to retention strategies, of which 43 (45.2%) dropped out. The Retention group included 136 participants exposed to enhanced retention strategies, of which 22 (16.2%) dropped out. Dropout risk factors included being unmarried, a longer diabetes duration, using oral antidiabetics as compared to not using, worse executive function and chronic pain. After adjusting for exposure to retention strategies, worse baseline executive function composite score (p = 0.001) and chronic pain diagnosis (p = 0.032) were independently associated with a greater risk of dropping out. The probability of dropping out decreased with longer exposure to retention strategies and the dropout rate per month decreased from 4.1% to 1.8% (p = 0.04) on retention strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline characteristics allow prediction of dropping out from a clinical trial in older participants. Retention strategies has been effective at minimizing the impact of dropout-related risk factors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials.gov NCT2415556 3/23/2015 (www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov).",

This systematic review summarized effects of cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to intranasal insulin to assess brain insulin sensitivity in healthy and diseased populations. We also explored relationships between changes in brain insulin sensitivity and cognitive performance. METHODS: A systemic literature search (PROSPERO: CRD42022309770) identified 58 randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated effects of intranasal insulin on (regional) CBF, cognitive performance, and systemic spill-over in adults. RESULTS: Acute intranasal insulin did not affect whole-brain CBF in healthy adults, but increased regional CBF of the inferior frontal gyrus, dorsal striatum, and insular cortex, and reduced CBF around the middle frontal gyrus and hypothalamus. Obese adults showed increased CBF responses following internasal insulin for the middle frontal gyrus but decreased CBF for hypothalamic and cortico-limbic regions. Furthermore, increased CBF responses were reported for the insular cortex in T2D patients and for occipital and thalamic regions in older adults. The spray also improved memory and executive function, but a causal relation with regional CBF still needs to be established. Finally, intranasal insulin resulted in only a small amount of systemic spill-over, which is unlikely to have an impact on the observed findings. CONCLUSIONS: Region-specific changes in CBF after intranasal insulin administration were affected by obesity, T2D, and normal aging, indicating altered brain insulin sensitivity. Future RCTs should investigate longer-term effects of intranasal insulin and explore potential associations between effects on CBF and cognitive performance.",

Some small, single-site studies indicated that intranasal insulin can enhance memory in patients with MCI or dementia.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of IN insulin on cognition in patients with MCI or dementia. METHODS: We searched the electronic database for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that verified the effects of insulin on patients with MCI or dementia.16 studies (899 patients) were identified. RESULTS: The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) showed no significant difference between IN insulin and placebo groups; however, statistical results suggested a difference between study groups in the effects of ADCS-ADL; AD patients with APOE4 (-) also showed improved performance in verbal memory; other cognitions did not improve significantly. CONCLUSION: In view of IN insulin's promising potential, more researches should be conducted at a larger dose after proper selection of insulin types and patients.

      "abstract": "Hyperglycemia due to relative hypoinsulinism is common in extremely preterm infants and is associated with hippocampus-mediated long-term cognitive impairment. In neonatal rats, hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia leads to oxidative stress, altered neurochemistry, microgliosis, and abnormal synaptogenesis in the hippocampus. Intranasal insulin (INS) bypasses the blood-brain barrier, targets the brain, and improves synaptogenesis in rodent models, and memory in adult humans with Alzheimer's disease or type 2 diabetes, without altering the blood levels of insulin or glucose. To test whether INS improves hippocampal development in neonatal hyperglycemia, rat pups were subjected to hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia by injecting streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 80 mg/kg i.p. on postnatal day (P) 2 and randomized to INS, 0.3U twice daily from P3-P6 (STZ + INS group), or no treatment (STZ group). The acute effects on hippocampal neurochemical profile and transcript mRNA expression of insulin receptor (Insr), glucose transporters (Glut1, Glut4, and Glut8), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp1, a marker of oxidative stress) were determined on P7 using in vivo 1H MR spectroscopy (MRS) and qPCR. The long-term effects on the neurochemical profile, microgliosis, and synaptogenesis were determined at adulthood using 1H MRS and histochemical analysis. Relative to the control (CONT) group, mean blood glucose concentration was higher from P3 to P6 in the STZ and STZ + INS groups. On P7, MRS showed 10% higher taurine concentration in both STZ groups. qPCR showed 3-folds higher Insr and 5-folds higher Glut8 expression in the two STZ groups. Parp1 expression was 18% higher in the STZ group and normal in the STZ + INS group. At adulthood, blood glucose concentration in the fed state was higher in the STZ and STZ + INS groups. MRS showed 59% higher brain glucose concentration and histochemistry showed microgliosis in the hippocampal subareas in the STZ group. Brain glucose was normal in the STZ + INS group. Compared with the STZ group, phosphocreatine and phosphocreatine/creatine ratio were higher, and microglia in the hippocampal subareas fewer in the STZ + INS group (p < 0.05 for all). Neonatal hyperglycemia was associated with abnormal glucose metabolism and microgliosis in the adult hippocampus. INS administration during hyperglycemia attenuated these adverse effects and improved energy metabolism in the hippocampus.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded trial consisted of 24-week INI or placebo treatment once daily and 24-week follow-up. Safety outcomes were: 1) Short-term effects on glycemic variability, hypoglycemic episodes on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) at baseline and on-treatment. 2) Long-term effects on glucose metabolism and weight on INI/placebo treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Of 86 screened subjects, 14 were randomized, 9 (5 INI, 4 Placebo) completed CGM at baseline and on-treatment, and 5 (2 INI, 3 Placebo) completed treatment and follow-up. RESULTS: INI was safe and was not associated with serious adverse events, hypoglycemic episodes or weight gain. INI administration did not acutely affect capillary glucose. Glycemic variability on CGM decreased with INI, compared to baseline. On INI treatment, there was a long-term trend toward lower HbA1c, plasma glucose and insulin. No interactions with subcutaneous insulins were observed. CONCLUSIONS: INI is safe in older people with diabetes treated with systemic insulins, and it is not associated with adverse events, hypoglycemia or weight gain. Future studies are needed to determine whether INI administration can reduce glycemic variability, improve insulin sensitivity and thus potentially lessen diabetes burden in this population."

      "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating subtype of stroke associated with high morbidity and mortality that is considered a medical emergency, mainly managed with adequate blood pressure control and creating a favorable hemostatic condition. However, to date, none of the randomized clinical trials have led to an effective treatment for ICH. It is vital to better understand the mechanisms underlying brain injury to effectively decrease ICH-associated morbidity and mortality. It is well known that initial hematoma formation and its expansion have detrimental consequences. The literature has recently focused on other pathological processes, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, edema formation, and neurotoxicity, that constitute secondary brain injury. Since conventional management has failed to improve clinical outcomes significantly, various neuroprotective therapies are tested in preclinical and clinical settings. Unlike intravenous administration, intranasal insulin can reach a higher concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid without causing systemic side effects. Intranasal insulin delivery has been introduced as a novel neuroprotective agent for certain neurological diseases, including ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury. Since there is an overlap of mechanisms causing neuroinflammation in these neurological diseases and ICH, we believe that preclinical studies testing the role of intranasal insulin therapy in ICH are warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed at assessing the long-term effects of intranasal insulin (INI) on cognition and gait in older people with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded trial consisted of 24 week treatment with 40 IU of INI (Novolin® R, off-label use) or placebo (sterile saline) once daily and 24 week follow-up. Primary outcomes were cognition, normal (NW), and dual-task (DTW) walking speeds. Of 244 randomized, 223 completed baseline (51 DM-INI, 55 DM-Placebo, 58 Control-INI, 59 Control-Placebo; 109 female, 65.8 ± 9.1; 50-85 years old); 174 completed treatment (84 DM, 90 Controls); 156 completed follow-up (69 DM). RESULTS: DM-INI had faster NW (~ 7 cm/s; p = 0.025) and DTW on-treatment (p = 0.007; p = 0.812 adjusted for baseline difference) than DM-Placebo. Control-INI had better executive functioning on-treatment (p = 0.008) and post-treatment (p = 0.007) and verbal memory post-treatment (p = 0.004) than Control-Placebo. DM-INI increased cerebral blood flow in medio-prefrontal cortex (p < 0.001) on MRI. Better vasoreactivity was associated with faster DTW (p < 0.008). In DM-INI, plasma insulin (p = 0.006) and HOMA-IR (p < 0.013) decreased post-treatment. Overall INI effect demonstrated faster walking (p = 0.002) and better executive function (p = 0.002) and verbal memory (p = 0.02) (combined DM-INI and Control-INI cohort, hemoglobin A1c-adjusted). INI was not associated with serious adverse events, hypoglycemic episodes, or weight gain. CONCLUSION: There is evidence for positive INI effects on cognition and gait. INI-treated T2DM participants walked faster, showed increased cerebral blood flow and decreased plasma insulin, while controls improved executive functioning and verbal memory. The MemAID trial provides proof-of-concept for preliminary safety and efficacy and supports future evaluation of INI role to treat T2DM and age-related functional decline.",

Several studies have reported that intranasal insulin administration ameliorates memory in AD patients and animal models. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet completely elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether insulin is involved in regulating the expression of AD-related microRNAs. Pursuing this objective, we first investigated the therapeutic effect of intranasal insulin on Aβ oligomer (AβO)-induced memory impairment in male rats using the Morris water maze task. Then, molecular and histological changes in response to AβO and/or insulin time course were assessed in the extracted hippocampi on days 1, 14, and 21 of the study using congo red staining, western blot and quantitative real-time PCR analyses. We observed memory impairment, Aβ aggregation, tau hyper-phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, insulin signaling dys-regulation, and down-regulation of miR-26a, miR-124, miR-29a, miR-181b, miR-125b, miR-132, and miR-146a in the hippocampus of AβO-exposed rats 21 days after AβO injection. Intranasal insulin treatment ameliorated memory impairment and concomitantly increased miR-132, miR-181b, and miR-125b expression, attenuated tau phosphorylation levels, Aβ aggregation, and neuroinflammation, and regulated the insulin signaling as well. In conclusion, our study suggest that the neuroprotective effects of insulin on memory observed in AD-like rats could be partially due to the restoration of miR-132, miR-181b, and miR-125b expression in the brain.",

In a recent phase 2 trial, participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD who were treated with INI with one of two delivery devices showed improved cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiles and slower symptom progression compared with placebo. In the cohort which showed benefit, we measured changes in CSF markers of inflammation, immune function and vascular integrity and assessed their relationship with changes in cognition, brain volume, and CSF amyloid and tau concentrations. The insulin-treated group had increased CSF interferon-γ (p = 0.032) and eotaxin (p = 0.049), and reduced interleukin-6 (p = 0.048) over the 12 month trial compared to placebo. Trends were observed for increased CSF macrophage-derived chemokine for the placebo group (p = 0.083), and increased interleukin-2 in the insulin-treated group (p = 0.093). Insulin-treated and placebo groups showed strikingly different patterns of associations between changes in CSF immune/inflammatory/vascular markers and changes in cognition, brain volume, and amyloid and tau concentrations. In summary, INI treatment altered the typical progression of markers of inflammation and immune function seen in AD, suggesting that INI may promote a compensatory immune response associated with therapeutic benefit.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 64 female Wistar rats received either distilled water, norethindrone (NOR), COC, intranasal insulin (INI), metformin (MET), saxagliptin (SAX), INI+MET, and INI+SAX. After 8 weeks of exposure to COC, the animals were sorted into the therapeutic groups. Several parameters were assayed for, such as body weight changes, fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, insulin levels, inflammatory cytokines, and glycated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac). RESULTS: The levels of FBG, insulin, and Hb1Ac were increased consequent upon COC treatment. Treatment with INI+SAX and INI+MET reduced significantly the levels of FBG and Hb1Ac; in addition, the level of insulin was significantly increased in the INI+MET groups (p ≤ 0.05). Serum lipid profile analysis showed a statistical reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level; this reduction was also significantly reversed in the INI+SAX group. Reduced catalase activity observed in the COC group was reversed in the INI+MET group (p ≤ 0.05). A nonsignificant increase in the level of TNF-α as a result of COC treatment was reversed by INI and INI+MET treatment. Liver GLUT4 and G-6-phosphate levels were significantly increased by COC treatment, and this effect was reversed by INI+SAX in both assays, respectively (p ≤ 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The use of MET and SAX in combination with INI has been shown to reverse some indices of MetS. This study proposes a clinical phase to backup and ascertain these preclinical findings."

Recent research has identified cerebral glucose hypometabolism as a pathophysiological mechanism offering a therapeutic target in delirium. Insulin, delivered via the intranasal route, acts directly on the central nervous system and has been shown to enhance cerebral metabolism and improve cognition in patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. This trial will determine whether intranasal insulin can reduce the duration of delirium in older hospitalised patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with 6 months follow-up. One hundred patients aged 65 years or older presenting to hospital with delirium admitted under geriatric medicine will be recruited. Participants will be randomised to intranasal insulin detemir or placebo administered twice daily until delirium resolves, defined as Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) negative for 2 days, or discharge from hospital. The primary outcome measure will be duration of delirium using the CAM. Secondary outcome measures will include length of hospital stay, severity of delirium, adherence to treatment, hospital complications, new admission to nursing home, mortality, use of antipsychotic medications during hospital stay and cognitive and physical function at 6 months postdischarge. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the South Eastern Sydney Human Research and Ethics Committee. Dissemination plans include submission to a peer-reviewed journal for publication and presentation at scientific conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12618000318280.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus continues to be a disease that affects a good percentage of our population. The majority affected need insulin on a day-to-day basis. Before the invention of the first manufactured insulin in 1978, dealing with diabetes took a significant toll on patient's lives. As technology and human innovation prevail, significant advancements have taken place in managing this chronic disease. Patients have an option to decide their mode of insulin delivery. Intranasal insulin, one such form, has a rapid mode of action while effectively controlling postprandial hyperglycemia. It has also been proven to reduce hypoglycemia and insulin resistance problems, which seem to be the main adverse effects of using conventional insulin regularly. However, due to the large dosages needed and high incurring costs, Intranasal Insulin is currently being used as adjunctive therapy along with conventional insulin.  We conducted a literature search in PubMed indexed journals using the medical terms \"Intranasal insulin,\" \"diabetes,\" and \"cognitive impairment\" to provide an overview of the mechanism of action of Intranasal Insulin, its distinctive cognitive benefits, and how it can be compared to the standard parenteral insulin therapy. One unique feature of intranasal insulin is its ability to directly affect the central nervous system, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Not only does this help in reducing the peripheral side effects of insulin, but it has also proven to play a role in improving the cognitive function of diabetics, especially those who have Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment, as decreased levels of insulin in the brain has been shown to impact cognitive function negatively. However, it does come with its limitations of poor absorption through the nasal mucosa due to mucociliary clearance and proteolytic enzymes, our body's natural defence mechanisms. This review focuses on the efficacy of intranasal insulin, its potential benefits, limitations, and role in cognitive improvement in people with diabetes with pre-existing cognitive impairment."

      "abstract": "Long-lasting cognitive impairment in juveniles undergoing repeated general anesthesia has been observed in numerous preclinical and clinical studies, yet, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown and no preventive treatment is available. We found that daily intranasal insulin administration to juvenile mice for 7 days prior to repeated isoflurane anesthesia rescues deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity in adulthood. Moreover, intranasal insulin prevented anesthesia-induced apoptosis of hippocampal cells, which is thought to underlie cognitive impairment. Inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a major intracellular effector of insulin receptor, blocked the beneficial effects of intranasal insulin on anesthesia-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking mTORC1 downstream translational repressor 4E-BP2 showed no induction of repeated anesthesia-induced apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that intranasal insulin prevents general anesthesia-induced apoptosis of hippocampal cells, and deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory, and suggests that the rescue effect is mediated via mTORC1/4E-BP2 signaling.",

MEASUREMENTS: Changes from baseline in global and regional white matter hyperintensity volume and gray matter volume were analyzed and related to changes in cerebral spinal fluid biomarkers, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition, Clinical Disease Rating-Sum of Boxes, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale, and a memory composite. RESULTS: The insulin-treated group demonstrated significantly reduced changes in white matter hyperintensity volume in deep and frontal regions after 12 months, with a similar trend for global volume. White matter hyperintensity volume progression correlated with worsened Alzheimer's disease cerebral spinal fluid biomarker profile and cognitive function; however, patterns of correlations differed by treatment group. CONCLUSION: Intranasal insulin treatment for 12 months reduced white matter hyperintensity volume progression and supports insulin's potential as a therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease.",

      "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke, intranasal insulin can act as a neuroprotective agent. However, whether intranasal insulin has a neuroprotective effect in intracerebral hemorrhage and its potential mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, a mouse model of autologous blood-induced intracerebral hemorrhage was treated with 0.5, 1, or 2 IU insulin via intranasal delivery, twice per day, until 24 or 72 hours after surgery. Compared with saline treatment, 1 IU intranasal insulin treatment significantly reduced hematoma volume and brain edema after cerebral hemorrhage, decreased blood-brain barrier permeability and neuronal degeneration damage, reduced neurobehavioral deficits, and improved the survival rate of mice. Expression levels of p-AKT and p-GSK3β were significantly increased in the perihematoma tissues after intranasal insulin therapy. Our findings suggest that intranasal insulin therapy can protect the neurological function of mice after intracerebral hemorrhage through the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the North Sichuan Medical College of China (approval No. NSMC(A)2019(01)) on January 7, 2019."

      "abstract": "The intranasal (IN) administration of neuropeptides, such as insulin and orexins, has been suggested as a treatment strategy for age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). Because dysfunctional neuropeptide signaling is an observed characteristic of ARCD, it has been suggested that IN delivery of insulin and/or orexins may restore endogenous peptide signaling and thereby preserve cognition. IN administration is particularly alluring as it is a relatively non-invasive method that directly targets peptides to the brain. Several laboratories have examined the behavioral effects of IN insulin in young, aged, and cognitively impaired rodents and humans. These studies demonstrated improved performance on various cognitive tasks following IN insulin administration. Fewer laboratories have assessed the effects of IN orexins; however, this peptide also holds promise as an effective treatment for ARCD through the activation of the cholinergic system and/or the reduction of neuroinflammation. Here, we provide a brief overview of the advantages of IN administration and the delivery pathway, then summarize the current literature on IN insulin and orexins. Additional preclinical studies will be useful to ultimately uncover the mechanisms underlying the pro-cognitive effects of IN insulin and orexins, whereas future clinical studies will aid in the determination of the most efficacious dose and dosing paradigm. Eventually, IN insulin and/or orexin administration may be a widely used treatment strategy in the clinic for ARCD.",

      "abstract": "Brain insulin signaling contributes to memory function and might be a viable target in the prevention and treatment of memory impairments including Alzheimer's disease. This short narrative review explores the potential of central nervous system (CNS) insulin administration via the intranasal pathway to improve memory performance in health and disease, with a focus on the most recent results. Proof-of-concept studies and (pilot) clinical trials in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease indicate that acute and prolonged intranasal insulin administration enhances memory performance, and suggest that brain insulin resistance is a pathophysiological factor in Alzheimer's disease with or without concomitant metabolic dysfunction. Intranasally administered insulin is assumed to trigger improvements in synaptic plasticity and regional glucose uptake as well as alleviations of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology; additional contributions of changes in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activity and sleep-related mechanisms are discussed. While intranasal insulin delivery has been conclusively demonstrated to be effective and safe, the recent outcomes of large-scale clinical studies underline the need for further investigations, which might also yield new insights into sex differences in the response to intranasal insulin and contribute to the optimization of delivery devices to grasp the full potential of intranasal insulin for Alzheimer's disease.",

Recently, insulin treatment through intranasal (IN) approach has gained attention in PD, although the underlying mechanism of its potential therapeutic effects is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of insulin treatment in a rat model of PD with emphasis on mitochondrial function indices in striatum. METHODS: Rats were treated with a daily low dose (4IU/day) of IN insulin, starting 72 h after 6-OHDA-induced lesion and continued for 14 days. Motor performance, dopaminergic cell survival, mitochondrial dehydrogenases activity, mitochondrial swelling, mitochondria permeability transition pore (mPTP), mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm ), reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and glutathione (GSH) content in mitochondria, mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the gene expression of PGC-1α, TFAM, Drp-1, GFAP, and Iba-1 were assessed. RESULTS: Intranasal insulin significantly reduces 6-OHDA-induced motor dysfunction and dopaminergic cell death. In parallel, it improves mitochondrial function indices and modulates mitochondria biogenesis and fission as well as activation of astrocytes and microglia. CONCLUSION: Considering the prominent role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathology, IN insulin as a disease-modifying therapy for PD should be considered for extensive research.",

      "abstract": "Although it is well established that diabetes impairs mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, little is known of the effects of intranasal insulin (INI) on the mitochondrial respiratory chain and structure-function of mitoBKCa channel in diabetes. We have investigated this mechanism in an STZ-induced early type 2 diabetic model. Single ATP-sensitive mitoBKCa channel activity was considered in diabetic and INI-treated rats using a channel incorporated into the bilayer lipid membrane. Because mitoBKCa channels have been involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, a study was undertaken to investigate whether the NADH, complexes I and IV, mitochondrial ROS production, and ΔΨm are altered in an early diabetic model. In this work, we provide evidence for a significant decrease in channel open probability and conductance in diabetic rats. Evidence has been shown that BKCa channel β2 subunits induce a left shift in the BKCa channel voltage dependent curve in low Ca2+ conditions,; our results indicated a significant decrease in mitoBKCa β2 subunits using Western blot analysis. Importantly, INI treatment improved mitoBKCa channel behaviors and β2 subunits expression up to ~70%. We found that early diabetes decreased activities of complex I and IV and increased NADH, ROS production, and ΔΨm. Surprisingly, INI modified the mitochondrial respiratory chain, ROS production, and ΔΨm up to ~70%. Our results thus demonstrate an INI improvement in respiratory chain activity and ROS production in brain mitochondrial preparations coming from the STZ early diabetic rat model, an effect potentially linked to INI improvement in mitoBKCa channel activity and channel β2 subunit expression.",

      "abstract": "Olfactory perception and learning play a vital role in the animal's entire life for habituation and survival. Insulin and insulin receptor signaling is well known to modulate the olfactory function and is also involved in the regulation of neurogenesis. A very high density of insulin receptors is present in the olfactory bulb (OB), the brain area involved in the olfactory function, where active adult neurogenesis also takes place. Hence, our study was aimed to explore the effect of intranasal insulin treatment and the involvement of the subventricular zone-olfactory bulb (SVZ-OB) neurogenesis on olfactory discriminative learning and memory in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV STZ) rat model. Our findings revealed that intranasal insulin treatment significantly increased ICV STZ-induced decrease in the olfactory discriminative learning. No significant change was observed in the post-treatment olfactory memory upon ICV STZ and intranasal insulin treatment. ICV STZ also caused a substantial decline in the SVZ-OB neurogenesis, as indicated by the reduction in the number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU+) cells, BrdU+ Nestin+ cells, and Doublecortin (DCX+) cells, which was reversed by intranasal insulin treatment. Intranasal insulin treatment also increased the number of immature neurons reaching the olfactory bulb (OB) as indicated by an increase in the DCX expression in the OB as compared to the ICV STZ administered group. ICV STZ administration also resulted in the modulation of the expression of the genes regulating postnatal SVZ-OB neurogenesis like Mammalian achaete scute homolog 1 (Mash 1), Neurogenin 2 (Ngn 2), Neuronal differentiation 1 (Neuro D1), and T box brain protein 2 (Tbr 2). Intranasal insulin treatment reverted these changes in gene expression, which might be responsible for the observed increase in the SVZ-OB neurogenesis and hence the olfactory discriminative learning.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Insulin modulates aspects of brain function relevant to Alzheimer disease and can be delivered to the brain using intranasal devices. To date, the use of intranasal insulin to treat persons with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia remains to be examined in a multi-site trial. OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of intranasal insulin for the treatment of persons with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease dementia in a phase 2/3 multisite clinical trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized (1:1) double-blind clinical trial was conducted between 2014 and 2018. Participants received 40 IU of insulin or placebo for 12 months during the blinded phase, which was followed by a 6-month open-label extension phase. The clinical trial was conducted at 27 sites of the Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute. A total of 432 adults were screened, and 144 adults were excluded. Inclusion criteria included adults aged 55 to 85 years with a diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease (based on National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association criteria), a score of 20 or higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination, a clinical dementia rating of 0.5 or 1.0, and a delayed logical memory score within a specified range. A total of 289 participants were randomized. Among the first 49 participants, the first device (device 1) used to administer intranasal insulin treatment had inconsistent reliability. A new device (device 2) was used for the remaining 240 participants, who were designated the primary intention-to-treat population. Data were analyzed from August 2018 to March 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 40 IU of insulin (Humulin-RU-100; Lilly) or placebo (diluent) daily for 12 months (blinded phase) followed by a 6-month open-label extension phase. Insulin was administered with 2 intranasal delivery devices. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome (mean score change on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 12) was evaluated at 3-month intervals. Secondary clinical outcomes were assessed at 6-month intervals. Cerebrospinal fluid collection and magnetic resonance imaging scans occurred at baseline and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 289 participants (155 men [54.6%]; mean [SD] age, 70.9 [7.1] years) were randomized. Of those, 260 participants completed the blinded phase, and 240 participants completed the open-label extension phase. For the first 49 participants, the first device used to administer treatment had inconsistent reliability. A second device was used for the remaining 240 participants (123 men [51.3%]; mean [SD] age, 70.8 [7.1] years), who were designated the primary intention-to-treat population. No differences were observed between treatment arms for the primary outcome (mean score change on ADAS-cog-12 from baseline to month 12) in the device 2 ITT cohort (0.0258 points; 95% CI, -1.771 to 1.822 points; P = .98) or for the other clinical or cerebrospinal fluid outcomes in the primary (second device) intention-to-treat analysis. No clinically important adverse events were associated with treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, no cognitive or functional benefits were observed with intranasal insulin treatment over a 12-month period among the primary intention-to-treat cohort.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intranasal administration of insulin to the brain bypasses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and can increase cerebral glucose uptake and prevent energy failure. Intranasal insulin treatment has shown neuroprotective effects in multiple central nervous system (CNS) lesions, but the effects of intranasal insulin on the metabolic and pathological process of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are not clear. This study is designed to explore the effects of intranasal insulin treatment on metabolic distress and early brain injury (EBI) after experimental SAH. METHODS: SAH model was built by endovascular filament perforation method in adult male C57BL/6J mice, and then, insulin was administrated via intranasal route at 0, 24, and 48 h post-SAH. EBI was assessed according to the neurological performance, BBB damage, brain edema, neuroinflammatory reaction, and neuronal apoptosis at each time point. To evaluate metabolic conditions, microdialysis was used to continuously monitor the real-time levels of glucose, pyruvate, and lactate in interstitial fluid (ISF) in living animals. The mRNA and protein expression of glucose transporter-1 and 3 (GLUT-1 and -3) were also tested by RT-PCR and Western blot in brain after SAH. RESULTS: Compared to vehicle, intranasal insulin treatment promoted the relative mRNA and protein levels of GLUT-1 in SAH brain (0.98 ± 0.020 vs 0.33 ± 0.016 at 24 h, 0.91 ± 0.25 vs 0.21 ± 0.013 at 48 h and 0.94 ± 0.025 vs 0.28 ± 0.015 at 72 h in mRNA/0.96 ± 0.023 vs 0.36 ± 0.015 at 24 h, 0.91 ± 0.022 vs 0.22 ± 0.011 at 48 h and 0.95 ± 0.024 vs 0.27 ± 0.014 at 72 h in protein, n = 8/Group, p < 0.001). Similar results were also observed in GLUT-3. Intranasal insulin reduced the lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR) and increased ISF glucose level. It also improved neurological dysfunction, BBB damage, and brain edema and attenuated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as neuronal apoptosis after SAH. CONCLUSIONS: The intranasal insulin treatment protects brain from EBI possibly via improving metabolic distress after SAH.",

However, finding the most efficient way to improve brain insulin resistance remains challenging. Peripheral administration of insulin does not have the desired therapeutic effect and may induce adverse reactions, such as hyperinsulinemia, but intranasal administration may be an efficient way. In the present study, we established a brain insulin resistance model through an intraventricular injection of streptozotocin, accompanied by cognitive impairment. Following intranasal insulin treatment, the learning and memory functions of mice were significantly restored, the neurogenesis in the hippocampus was improved, the level of insulin in the brain increased, and the activation of the IRS-1-PI3K-Akt-GSK3β insulin signal pathway, but not the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway, was markedly increased. The olfactory bulb-subventricular zone-subgranular zone (OB-SVZ-SGZ) axis might be the mechanism through which intranasal insulin regulates cognition in brain-insulin-resistant mice. Thus, intranasal insulin administration may be a highly efficient way to improve cognitive function by increasing cerebral insulin levels and reversing insulin resistance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Down syndrome are likely to develop clinical and neuropathological brain changes resembling Alzheimer's disease dementia by the ages of 35-40 years. Intranasal insulin is a potential treatment for neurodegenerative disease that has been shown to reduce amyloid plaque burden and improve verbal memory performance in normal as well as memory-impaired adults. Investigations have shown that rapid-acting insulins may result in superior cognitive benefits compared with regular insulin. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to measure the safety and feasibility of intranasal rapid-acting glulisine in subjects with Down syndrome. Secondarily, we estimated the effects of intranasal glulisine on cognition and memory in Down syndrome. METHODS: A single-center, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study was performed to test the safety of intranasal glulisine vs placebo in 12 subjects with Down syndrome aged ≥ 35 years. Intranasal administration utilized the Impel NeuroPharma I109 Precision Olfactory Delivery (POD®) device. The primary outcomes were the occurrence of any or related adverse and serious adverse events. Secondary post-treatment cognitive outcome measures included performance on the Fuld Object-Memory Evaluation and Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test. RESULTS: Intranasal glulisine was safe and well tolerated in the Down syndrome population. No adverse or serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations are necessary to better evaluate the potential cognitive-enhancing role of intranasal insulin in the Down syndrome population. CLINICALTRIALS.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accelerates brain aging and increases the risk for dementia. Insulin is a key neurotrophic factor in the brain, where it modulates energy metabolism, neurovascular coupling, and regeneration. Impaired insulin-mediated brain signaling and central insulin resistance may contribute to cognitive and functional decline in T2DM. Intranasal insulin (INI) has emerged as a potential therapy for treating T2DM-related cognitive impairment. METHODS/DESIGN: Ongoing from 2015, a prospective, two-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 210 subjects (120 T2DM and 90 non-diabetic older adults) randomized into four treatment arms (60 T2DM-INI, 60 T2DM-Placebo, 45 Control-INI, and 45 Control-Placebo) evaluating the long-term effects of daily intranasal administration of 40 International Units (IU) of human insulin, as compared to placebo (sterile saline) over 24 weeks and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Study outcomes are: 1) long-term INI effects on cognition, daily functionality, and gait speed; 2) identifying a clinically relevant phenotype that predicts response to INI therapy; 3) long-term safety. CONCLUSION: This study addresses an important knowledge gap about the long-term effects of intranasal insulin on memory and cognition in older people with T2DM and non-diabetic controls, and may provide a novel therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of cognitive and functional decline and dementia.

      "abstract": "Addiction to substances such as alcohol, cocaine, opioids, and methamphetamine poses a continuing clinical and public challenge globally. Despite progress in understanding substance use disorders, challenges remain in their treatment. Some of these challenges include limited ability of therapeutics to reach the brain (blood-brain barrier), adverse systemic side effects of current medications, and importantly key aspects of addiction not addressed by currently available treatments (such as cognitive impairment). Inability to sustain abstinence or seek treatment due to cognitive deficits such as poor decision-making and impulsivity is known to cause poor treatment outcomes. In this review, we provide an evidenced-based rationale for intranasal drug delivery as a viable and safe treatment modality to bypass the blood-brain barrier and target insulin to the brain to improve the treatment of addiction. Intranasal insulin with improvement of brain cell energy and glucose metabolism, stress hormone reduction, and improved monoamine transmission may be an ideal approach for treating multiple domains of addiction including memory and impulsivity. This may provide additional benefits to enhance current treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "Insulin receptors are present in brain areas that are involved in the control of hunger and satiety, and intranasal insulin is assumed to have an anorexigenic effect. This known influence of insulin on satiety encouraged us to investigate the effect of intranasal insulin on feeding-related behaviors. The aim of the current study was to explore the influence of 40 IU of intranasal insulin on the grocery shopping behavior and cookie consumption in a group of 30 healthy young men, using a crossover randomized double-blind design. Using a virtual mock supermarket, we tested whether the intranasal administration of insulin influences purchase behavior in comparison to a placebo or control condition. The participants also provided hedonic ratings of food pictures, as well as their subjective feeling of hunger. We calculated an objective measure of hunger from the amount of cookies eaten. In contradiction to our hypotheses, no significant differences regarding ratings, calorie content of purchased food products, and cookie consumption were found between the treatment conditions. Our conclusion is that 40 IU intranasal insulin had no influence on the evaluation of pictured foods in healthy young men in our task. Acknowledging that previous studies have found effects for intranasal insulin and food cue processing, we suggest that future research should focus on chemosensory stimulation or cognitive tasks in behavioral experiments and carefully consider the doses of intranasal insulin.

      "abstract": "The inflammatory process plays a critical role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Insulin is used in preclinical and clinical studies of neurological disorders. Its intranasal (IN) administration directly in the brain allows for its peripheral metabolic effects to be avoided. Swiss male mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.1 mg/kg) to induce low-grade inflammation. IN insulin treatment was initiated 4 h later at a dose of 1.7 IU once daily for 5 days. LPS induced cognitive deficits, which the IN insulin treatment reversed. LPS significantly decreased, whereas IN insulin significantly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor-β in the cortex. In the hippocampus, IN insulin significantly decreased the BDNF level. LPS significantly increased the interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the cortex, while IN Insulin significantly decreased its levels in the hippocampus. The tumor necrosis factor-α levels were significantly decreased by IN insulin both in the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, IN insulin significantly increased the IL-10 levels in the cortex. The levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress were significantly higher in the LPS-treated mice; however, IN insulin had a modulatory effect on both. LPS significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activity both in the cortex and hippocampus, whereas IN insulin significantly increased the activity of both superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus and that of catalase in the cortex. The hydrogen peroxide levels revealed that LPS significantly affected the electron transport chain. Therefore, IN insulin could be useful in the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.",

However, the impact of different formulations and the duration of treatment on insulin's efficacy and the cellular processes targeted by the treatment remain unclear. Here, we tested whether intranasal insulin aspart, a short-acting insulin formulation, could alleviate memory decline associated with aging and whether long-term treatment affected regulation of insulin receptors and other potential targets. Outcome variables included measures of spatial learning and memory, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of the insulin receptor, and hippocampal microarray analyses. Aged Fischer 344 rats receiving long-term (3 months) intranasal insulin did not show significant memory enhancement on the Morris water maze task. Autoradiography results showed that long-term treatment reduced insulin binding in the thalamus but not the hippocampus. Results from hippocampal immunofluorescence revealed age-related decreases in insulin immunoreactivity that were partially offset by intranasal administration. Microarray analyses highlighted numerous insulin-sensitive genes, suggesting insulin aspart was able to enter the brain and alter hippocampal RNA expression patterns including those associated with tumor suppression. Our work provides insights into potential mechanisms of intranasal insulin and insulin resistance, and highlights the importance of treatment duration and the brain regions targeted.",

We aimed to examine the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on cognitive decline, and of cognitive impairment on food intake and body-weight, and explore efficacy of chronic intranasal insulin (INI) therapy. We used control (C) and triple transgenic mice (3×Tg, a model of Alzheimer's pathology) to measure cerebral mass, glucose metabolism, and the metabolic response to acute INI administration (cerebral insulin sensitivity). Y-Maze, positron emission-computed tomography, and histology were employed in 8 and 14-month-old mice, receiving normal diet (ND) or HFD. Chronic INI therapy was tested in an additional 3×Tg-HFD group. The 3×Tg groups overate, and had lower body-weight, but similar BMI, than diet-matched controls. Cognitive decline was progressive from HFD to 3×Tg-ND to 3×Tg-HFD. At 8 months, brain fasting glucose uptake (GU) was increased by C-HFD, and this effect was blunted in 3×Tg-HFD mice, also showing brain insulin resistance. Brain mass was reduced in 3×Tg mice at 14 months. Dentate gyrus dimensions paralleled cognitive findings. Chronic INI preserved cognition, dentate gyrus and metabolism, reducing food intake, and body weight in 3×Tg-HFD mice. Peripherally, leptin was suppressed and PAI-1 elevated in 3×Tg mice, correlating inversely with cerebral GU. In conclusion, 3×Tg background and HFD exert additive (genes*lifestyle) detriment to the brain, and cognitive dysfunction is accompanied by increased food intake in 3×Tg mice. PAI-1 levels and leptin deficiency were identified as potential peripheral contributors. Chronic INI improved peripheral and central outcomes."

We previously proposed insulin signaling mediators in plasma neuronal-enriched extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers of brain insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: We sought to demonstrate the capacity of neuronal-enriched EV biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement in response to intranasal insulin and their ability to track treatment-associated cognitive changes in AD. METHODS: We isolated neuronal-enriched EVs from plasma samples of participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or probable AD involved in a 4-month duration placebo-controlled clinical trial of 20 or 40 IU intranasal insulin. We measured insulin signaling mediators as biomarkers and examined treatment-associated changes and their relationship with cognitive performance (ADAS-Cog). RESULTS: There were no EV biomarker changes from baseline in any of the treatment groups. In participants treated with 20 IU insulin, EV biomarkers of insulin resistance (pS312-IRS-1, pY-IRS-1) showed strong positive correlations with ADAS-Cog changes, especially in ApoE ɛ4 non-carriers. CONCLUSION: Neuronal EV biomarkers of insulin resistance (pS312-IRS-1, pY-IRS-1) were associated with cognitive changes in response to low dose intranasal insulin suggesting engagement of the insulin cascade in neurons of origin.",

Intranasal insulin therapy improves cognition in Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. Here we tested intranasal insulin therapy in a model of HIV-NCI in EcoHIV-infected conventional mice. DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin pharmacokinetics following intranasal administration to mice was determined by ELISA. Mice were inoculated with EcoHIV to cause NCI; 23 days or 3 months after infection they were treated daily for 9 days with intranasal insulin (2.4 IU/mouse) and examined for NCI in behavioral tests and HIV burdens by quantitative PCR. Some animals were tested for hippocampal neuronal integrity by immunostaining and expression of neuronal function-related genes by real time-quantitative PCR. The effect of insulin treatment discontinuation on cognition and neuropathology was also examined. RESULTS: Intranasal insulin administration to mice resulted in μIU/ml levels of insulin in cerebrospinal fluid with a half-life of about 2 h, resembling pharmacokinetic parameters of patients receiving 40 IU. Intranasal insulin treatment starting 23 days or 3 months after infection completely reversed NCI in mice. Murine NCI correlated with reductions in hippocampal dendritic arbors and downregulation of neuronal function genes; intranasal insulin reversed these changes coincident with restoration of cognitive acuity, but they returned within 24 h of treatment cessation. Intranasal insulin treatment reduced brain HIV DNA when started 23 but not 90 days after infection. CONCLUSION: Our preclinical studies support the use of intranasal insulin administration for treatment of HIV-NCI and suggest that some dendritic injury in this condition is reversible.",

      "abstract": "Insulin modulates dopamine neuron activity in midbrain and affects processes underlying food intake behaviour, including impulsivity and reward processing. Here, we used intranasal administration and task-free functional MRI in humans to assess time- and dose-dependent effects of insulin on functional connectivity of the dopaminergic midbrain - and how these effects varied depending on systemic insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA-IR. Specifically, we used a repeated-measures design with factors dose (placebo, 40 IU, 100 IU, 160 IU), time (7 time points during a 90 min post-intervention interval), and group (low vs. high HOMA-IR). A factorial analysis identified a three-way interaction (with whole-brain significance) with regard to functional connectivity between midbrain and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. This interaction demonstrates that systemic insulin sensitivity modulates the temporal course and dose-dependent effects of intranasal insulin on midbrain functional connectivity. It suggests that altered insulin sensitivity may impact on dopaminergic projections of the midbrain and might underlie the dysregulation of reward-related and motivational behaviour in obesity and diabetes. Perhaps most importantly, the time courses of midbrain functional connectivity we present may provide useful guidance for the design of future human studies that utilize intranasal insulin administration.",

      "abstract": "Insulin signaling in the brain plays a critical role in metabolic control and cognitive function. Targeting insulinergic pathways in the central nervous system via peripheral insulin administration is feasible, but associated with systemic effects that necessitate tight supervision or countermeasures. The intranasal route of insulin administration, which largely bypasses the circulation and thereby greatly reduces these obstacles, has now been repeatedly tested in proof-of-concept studies in humans as well as animals. It is routinely used in experimental settings to investigate the impact on eating behavior, peripheral metabolism, memory function and brain activation of acute or long-term enhancements in central nervous system insulin signaling. Epidemiological and experimental evidence linking deteriorations in metabolic control such as diabetes with neurodegenerative diseases imply pathophysiological relevance of dysfunctional brain insulin signaling or brain insulin resistance, and suggest that targeting insulin in the brain holds some promise as a therapy or adjunct therapy. This short narrative review gives an overview over recent findings on brain insulin signaling as derived from human studies deploying intranasal insulin, and evaluates the potential of therapeutic interventions that target brain insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that elderly individuals are at increased risk of cognitive decline after general anesthesia. General anesthesia is also believed to be a risk factor for Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Intranasal administration of insulin, which delivers the drug directly into the brain, improves memory and cognition in both animal studies and small clinical trials. However, how insulin treatment improves cognitive function is poorly understood. METHODS: Aged mice were pretreated with intranasal insulin or saline before anesthesia. Propofol was added intraperitoneally to the mice from 7th day of insulin/saline treatment, and general anesthesia was induced and maintained for 2 hours/day for 5 consecutive days. Mice were evaluated at 26th day when the mice were continued on insulin or saline administration for another 15 days. RESULTS: We found that intranasal insulin treatment prevented anesthesia-induced cognitive impairments, as measured by novel object recognition test and contextual-dependent fear conditioning test. Insulin treatment also increased the expression level of Post-synaptic Density Protein 95 (PSD95), as well as upregulated Microtubule-associated Protein-2 (MAP-2) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we found that insulin treatment restored insulin signaling disturbed by anesthesia via activating PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathway, and attenuated anesthesia-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau at multiple AD-associated sites. We found the attenuation of tau hyperphosphorylation occurred by increasing the level of GSK3β phosphorylated at Ser9, which leads to inactivation of GSK-3β. CONCLUSION: Intranasal insulin administration might be a promising therapy to prevent anesthesiainduced cognitive deficit in elderly individuals.",

      "abstract": "Obesity constitutes a global health care problem, and often eating habits are to blame. For intervention, a thorough understanding of energy intake and expenditure is needed. In recent years, the pivotal role of insulin in connection to energy intake was established. Olfactory sensitivity may be a target of cerebral insulin action to maintain body weight. With this experiment, we aimed to explore the influence of intranasal insulin on olfactory sensitivity for the odors n-butanol and peanut in a placebo-controlled, double-blind setting in a within-subject design. All subjects participated in two experimental sessions on separate days and received either intranasal insulin or placebo in a pseudorandomized order. Application was followed by two olfactory threshold tests for n-butanol and peanut in a pseudorandomized order. After a single dose of intranasal insulin (40 IU) or placebo (0.4 ml), olfactory sensitivity for the odorants n-butanol and peanut were examined in 30 healthy normosmic participants (14 females). Measured blood parameters revealed no decrease in plasma glucose, however, insulin, leptin and cortisol levels were affected following intranasal application. Females' but not males' olfactory sensitivity for n-butanol was lower after intranasal insulin administration vs. placebo. In contrast, olfactory sensitivity for peanut was not influenced by intranasal insulin application. Our results indicate that the effects of cortical insulin levels on processing of specific odors is likely modulated by gender, as central increase of insulin concentration led to a reduced olfactory sensitivity for n-butanol in women only, which might be due to differentially regulated insulin and leptin signaling in men and women."

Intranasal insulin (INI) administration is under evaluation as a strategy to alleviate brain insulin resistance; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying INI beneficial effects are still unclear. We show that INI improves insulin signaling activation in the hippocampus and cortex of adult and aged 3×Tg-AD mice by ameliorating BVR-A activation. These changes were associated with a reduction of nitrosative stress, Tau phosphorylation, and Aβ oligomers in brain, along with improved cognitive functions. The role of BVR-A was strengthened by showing that cells lacking BVR-A: (i) develop insulin resistance if treated with insulin and (ii) can be recovered from insulin resistance only if treated with a BVR-A-mimetic peptide. These novel findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying INI treatment effects and suggest BVR-A as potential therapeutic target to prevent brain insulin resistance in AD.",

Study Design This is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Setting Intervention. Subjects and Methods This study was administered on 38 patients with hyposmia according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly divided into 2 parallel groups. The intervention and placebo groups underwent endoscopic placement of intranasal insulin gel foam (40 IU) and saline-soaked gel foam into the olfactory cleft, respectively. The procedure was performed twice a week for 4 weeks with butanol threshold testing initially and 4 weeks after treatment. Results The Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center score in the intervention group was significantly higher compared to that of the placebo group after 4 weeks ( P = .01). Moreover, no adverse effects were reported in both groups. Conclusion Our findings indicated that intranasal insulin (40 IU) administration may trigger the improvement in the olfactory sense and also appears to be free of significant adverse events in this small cohort.

A safe alternative of IV insulin is intranasal (IN) insulin. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of IN insulin on cognitive function of patients with either AD or MCI. METHODS: A literature search of the electronic databases Medline, Scopus and CENTRAL was performed to identify RCTs investigating the effect of IN insulin administration on cognitive tasks, in patients with AD or MCI. RESULTS: Seven studies (293 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Most studies showed that verbal memory and especially story recall was improved after IN insulin administration. Sometimes the effect was restricted for apoe4 (-) patients. Intranasal insulin did not affect other cognitive functions. However, there were some positive results in functional status and daily activity. Data suggested that different insulin types and doses may have different effects on different apoe4 groups. In addition, the effects of treatment on Αβ levels differed from study to study. Finally, IN insulin resulted in minor adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal insulin improved story recall performance of apoe4 (-) patients with AD or MCI. Other cognitive functions were not affected, but there were some positive results in functional status and daily activity. Since IN insulin is a safe intervention, future studies should be conducted with larger doses and after proper selection of patients and insulin types.",

      "abstract": "Rapid-acting, non-irritating nasal treatment options for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy are lacking. The halt in development is due, in part, to difficulty in delivering compounds across the blood brain barrier. Recently, in both human and animal models, insulin was shown to be capable of being transported to the cerebrospinal fluid and various brain regions via the \"nose-to-brain\" pathway, which bypasses the blood brain barrier, but is not free of its own unique, though different from blood brain barrier, challenges. This review will first evaluate and critique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evidence of intranasal insulin (i.e., nose-to-brain) delivery. As intranasal insulin has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in reducing nicotine cravings, in the remainder of the review, hypothesis-generating literature for additional mediators (i.e., other than the already shown nicotine craving) of smoking persistence will be reviewed. In particular, weight gain, impulsive behavior, and anhedonia have been shown to contribute to the inability to quit smoking. For each of these, after reviewing how the mediator promotes smoking, intranasal insulin literature from animal and clinical models will be critiqued in assessing whether a hypothesis may be generated that intranasal insulin may alleviate it, thereby potentially contributing to a successful smoking cessation outcome."

IN insulin treatment (0.5IU/day, for 7days after MA discontinuation) attenuated MA-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze task, and significantly decreased the levels of glial cell markers (GFAP and Iba1), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) as well as COX2 and NF-κB players of neuroinflammation, in the hippocampus of MA-treated animals. These findings introduce insulin as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of MA aversive symptoms.",

Recently, it has been reported insulin signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis are involved in cognitive processes. This study aimed to examine whether MA induces cognitive deficits concomitant with insulin signaling impairment and mitochondrial dysfunctions and also intranasal (IN) insulin treatment can reverse cognitive deficits caused by MA. Rats were repeatedly treated with increasing doses of MA (1-10 mg/kg) twice a day for 10 days, and their cognitive functions were assessed using Y-maze, novel object recognition and passive avoidance tasks. The expression of components involved in insulin signaling (IR/IRS2/PI3K/Akt/GSK3β) and mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, NRF1, and TFAM) was measured in the hippocampus. Therapeutic effects of IN insulin delivery (0.5- IU/day, for 7 days after MA discontinuation) were also investigated in MA-treated animals. Our results showed that repeated MA exposure induced cognitive deficits, and led to insulin signaling impairment and mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, IN insulin treatment reduced MA-induced cognitive impairments possibly through activating insulin signaling, particularly PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus, insulin and insulin signaling pathway can be considered as useful targets for the treatment of abnormalities associated with MA abuse.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse effects in diabetic mothers offspring (DMO) are a major concern of increasing incidence. Among these, chronic central complications in DMO remain poorly understood, and in extreme cases, diabetes can essentially function as a gestational brain insult. Nevertheless, therapeutic alternatives for DMO are limited. METHODS: Therefore, we have analyzed the central long-term complications in the offspring from CD1 diabetic mothers treated with streptozotozin, as well as the possible reversion of these alterations by insulin administration to neonates. Brain atrophy, neuronal morphology, tau phosphorylation, proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed in the short term (P7) and in the early adulthood (10 weeks) and cognitive function was also analyzed in the long-term. RESULTS: Central complications in DMO were still detected in the adulthood, including cortical and hippocampal thinning due to synaptic loss and neuronal simplification, increased tau hyperphosphorylation, and diminished cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Additionally, maternal diabetes increased the long-term susceptibility to spontaneous central bleeding, inflammation and cognition impairment in the offspring. On the other hand, intracerebroventricular insulin administration to neonates significantly reduced observed alterations. Moreover, non-invasive intranasal insulin reversed central atrophy and tau hyperphosphorylation, and rescued central proliferation and neurogenesis. Vascular damage, inflammation and cognitive alterations were also comparable to their counterparts born to nondiabetic mice, supporting the utility of this pathway to access the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: Our data underlie the long-term effects of central complications in DMO. Moreover, observed improvement after insulin treatment opens the door to therapeutic alternatives for children who are exposed to poorly controlled gestational diabetes, and who may benefit from more individualized treatments.",

      "abstract": "General anesthesia increases the risk for cognitive impairment post operation, especially in the elderly and vulnerable individuals. Recent animal studies on the impact of anesthesia on postoperative cognitive impairment have provided some valuable insights, but much remains to be understood. Here, by using mice of various ages and conditions, we found that anesthesia with propofol and sevoflurane caused significant deficits in spatial learning and memory, as tested using Morris Water Maze (MWM) 2-6 days after anesthesia exposure, in aged (17-18 months old) wild-type (WT) mice and in adult (7-8 months old) 3xTg-AD mice (a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD)), but not in adult WT mice. Anesthesia resulted in long-term neurobehavioral changes in the fear conditioning task carried out 65 days after exposure to anesthesia in 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, daily intranasal administration of insulin (1.75 U/mouse/day) for only 3 days prior to anesthesia completely prevented the anesthesia-induced deficits in spatial learning and memory and the long-term neurobehavioral changes tested 65 days after exposure to anesthesia in 3xTg-AD mice. These results indicate that aging and AD-like brain pathology increase the vulnerability to cognitive impairment after anesthesia and that intranasal treatment with insulin can prevent anesthesia-induced cognitive impairment."

Intranasal insulin administration has been reported to improve memory and attention in healthy participants and in AD patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we treated intracerebroventricular streptozotocin-injected (ICV-STZ) rats, a commonly used animal model of sporadic AD, with daily intranasal delivery of insulin (2 U/day) for 6 consecutive weeks and then studied their cognitive function with the Morris water maze test and biochemical changes via Western blotting. We observed cognitive deficits, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation in the brains of ICV-STZ rats. Intranasal insulin treatment for 6 weeks significantly improved cognitive function, attenuated the level of tau hyperphosphorylation, ameliorated microglial activation, and enhanced neurogenesis in ICV-STZ rats. Additionally, our results indicate that intranasal delivery of insulin probably attenuates tau hyperphosphorylation through the down-regulation of ERK1/2 and CaMKII in the brains of ICV-STZ rats. Our findings demonstrate a beneficial effect of intranasal insulin and provide the mechanistic basis for treating AD patients with intranasal insulin.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and elevated circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are common characteristics of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In rodents, brain insulin signaling controls both hepatic triglyceride secretion and BCAA catabolism. Whether brain insulin signaling controls similar metabolic pathways in humans is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Here we assessed if intranasal insulin, a method to preferentially deliver insulin to the central nervous system, is able to modulate hepatic lipid content and plasma BCAAs in humans. DESIGN/SETTING: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at the Medical University of Vienna. PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTION: We assessed if a chronic 4-week intranasal insulin treatment (40 IU, 4 times daily) reduces hepatic triglyceride content and circulating BCAAs in 20 healthy male volunteers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hepatic lipid content was assessed noninvasively by 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and BCAAs were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry at defined time points during the study. RESULTS: Chronic intranasal insulin treatment did not alter body weight, body mass index, and hepatic lipid content but reduced circulating BCAA levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the notion that brain insulin controls BCAA metabolism in humans. Thus, brain insulin resistance could account at least in part for the elevated BCAA levels observed in the insulin-resistant state.",

      "abstract": "Intranasal insulin delivery is currently being used in clinical trials to test for improvement in human memory and cognition, and in particular, for lessening memory loss attributed to neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have reported the effects of short-term intranasal insulin treatment on various behaviors, but less have examined long-term effects. The olfactory bulb contains the highest density of insulin receptors in conjunction with the highest level of insulin transport within the brain. Previous research from our laboratory has demonstrated that acute insulin intranasal delivery (IND) enhanced both short- and long-term memory as well as increased two-odor discrimination in a two-choice paradigm. Herein, we investigated the behavioral and physiological effects of chronic insulin IND. Adult, male C57BL6/J mice were intranasally treated with 5μg/μl of insulin twice daily for 30 and 60days. Metabolic assessment indicated no change in body weight, caloric intake, or energy expenditure following chronic insulin IND, but an increase in the frequency of meal bouts selectively in the dark cycle. Unlike acute insulin IND, which has been shown to cause enhanced performance in odor habituation/dishabituation and two-odor discrimination tasks in mice, chronic insulin IND did not enhance olfactometry-based odorant discrimination or olfactory reversal learning. In an object memory recognition task, insulin IND-treated mice did not perform differently than controls, regardless of task duration. Biochemical analyses of the olfactory bulb revealed a modest 1.3 fold increase in IR kinase phosphorylation but no significant increase in Kv1.3 phosphorylation. Substrate phosphorylation of IR kinase downstream effectors (MAPK/ERK and Akt signaling) proved to be highly variable. These data indicate that chronic administration of insulin IND in mice fails to enhance olfactory ability, object memory recognition, or a majority of systems physiology metabolic factors - as reported to elicit a modulatory effect with acute administration. This leads to two alternative interpretations regarding long-term insulin IND in mice: 1) It causes an initial stage of insulin resistance to dampen the behaviors that would normally be modulated under acute insulin IND, but ability to clear a glucose challenge is still retained, or 2) There is a lack of behavioral modulation at high concentration of insulin attributed to the twice daily intervals of hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin IND administration without any insulin resistance, per se.",

      "abstract": "Many cigarette smokers express a desire to quit smoking, but ~85% of cessation attempts fail. In our attempt to delineate genetic modulators of smoking persistence, we have earlier shown that a locus within an ~250 kb haplotype block spanning the 5' untranslated region region of insulin-degrading enzyme is associated with serum cotinine levels; the study's measure of smoking quantity. Based on our findings, and coupled with recent preclinical studies showing the importance of multiple neuropeptides in reinstatement of drug use, we formulated intranasal insulin to evaluate its efficacy during acute abstinence from smoking. Our original study was a crossover trial including 19 otherwise healthy smokers who abstained from smoking for 36 h. The morning following their second night of abstinence, in random order, study participants received intranasal insulin (60 IU) or placebo (8.7% sodium chloride). The goal of our second study was to replicate the craving findings from the original trial and expand this research by including additional stress-related measures. Thirty-seven study participants abstained from smoking overnight. The next day, they were administered either intranasal insulin (60 IU) or placebo, following which they participated in the Trier Social Stress Test Task. This was a parallel design study focusing on the standard stress subjective, hormonal and cardiovascular measures. We also evaluated any changes in circulating glucose, insulin and c-peptide (a marker of endogenous insulin). In the original study, intranasal insulin significantly reduced morning nicotine craving (b=3.65, P⩽0.05). Similarly, in the second study, intranasal insulin reduced nicotine cravings over time (b=0.065, P⩽0.05) and the effect lasted through the psychosocial stress period. Intranasal insulin also increased circulating cortisol levels (F=12.78, P⩽0.001). No changes in insulin or c-peptide were detected. A significant treatment × time interaction (P⩽0.05) was detected for glucose, but subjects remained well within the euglycemic range. Previous studies have shown that heightened nicotine cravings and blunted response to stress are independent and significant predictors of relapse to smoking. In our study, intranasal insulin normalized the subjective and hormonal response to stress. As such, intranasal insulin should further be studied in a larger clinical trial of smoking cessation. In support of this, we provide evidence that the treatment is safe and effective and, based on absence of peripheral insulin changes, conclude that the pharmacodynamic effect is centrally driven.",

This study has been designed to evaluate the effects of intranasal insulin regimen, as a bypass system of BBB, on spatial memory in amyloid-beta (Aβ) model of AD in rat. Unilateral infusion of Aβ25-35 (10 nmol/2 µl/rat) into the lateral ventricular region of brain was used to produce a rat model of AD. After a 24-h recovery period, rats received insulin or vehicle via intraperitoneal or intranasal route (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 IU) for 14 days. Memory function in rats was assessed by Morris water maze test, with 5 days of training and consequent probe test protocol. Different doses of intraperitoneal insulin did not have a significant effect on learning and memory in AD rats. However, intranasal insulin at doses of 0.2 and 0.3 IU improved the learning and memory in Aβ-received rats. In conclusion, intranasal insulin as a non-invasive strategy improves spatial learning and memory in AD model.",

Cognitive deficits result from cellular and metabolic dysfunction after injury, including decreased cerebral glucose uptake and inflammation. This study assessed the ability of intranasal insulin to increase cerebral glucose uptake after injury, reduce lesion volume, improve memory and learning function and reduce inflammation. Adult male rats received a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury followed by intranasal insulin or saline treatment daily for 14 days. PET imaging of [18F]-FDG uptake was performed at baseline and at 48 h and 10 days post-injury and MRI on days three and nine post injury. Motor function was tested with the beam walking test. Memory function was assessed with Morris water maze. Intranasal insulin after CCI significantly improved several outcomes compared to saline. Insulin-treated animals performed better on beam walk and demonstrated significantly improved memory. A significant increase in [18F]-FDG uptake was observed in the hippocampus. Intranasal insulin also resulted in a significant decrease in hippocampus lesion volume and significantly less microglial immunolabeling in the hippocampus. These data show that intranasal insulin improves memory, increases cerebral glucose uptake and decreases neuroinflammation and hippocampal lesion volume, and may therefore be a viable therapy for TBI.",

We examined whether intranasal insulin offered a beneficial effect across measures of cognitive function in adults with MDD. METHODS: Thirty-five adults (18-65 years of age: 47.09±9.89) meeting criteria for a major depressive episode as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV-Treatment Revised were included in this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study. Subjects were not stratified based on baseline cognitive deficit. Subjects were randomized to 4 weeks of either intranasal insulin 40 International Units (IU) taken four times a day (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening, and before bed) (QID) (n=19) or placebo (n=16). RESULTS: No between group differences were observed in change from baseline on total Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (25.98±2.81), in either of the Positive or Negative subscales of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), or on a global index of neurocognition. The possibility of practice and/or carry over effect could not be excluded. Methodological refinement (e.g., stratification of subjects based on baseline cognitive deficit) may have augmented assay sensitivity.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with reduced insulin level and impairment of insulin receptor (IR) signaling in the brain, which correlates to amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and synaptic neurotoxicity. Clinical studies show that intranasal insulin improves memory in AD patients without peripheral hypoglycemia. However, neuroprotective molecular mechanism of the beneficial effect of intranasal insulin in AD pathology is unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the role of intranasal insulin on intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory impairment in rats as evaluated in the Morris water maze test. STZ (ICV) treated rats had shown memory impairment along with a significant decrease in IR signaling molecules (IR, pIRS-1, pAkt, and pGSK-3α/β expression) and IDE expression in both hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Intranasal insulin delivery prevented these changes. Moreover, intranasal insulin was found to inhibit significantly glial cell activation (GFAP and Iba-1 expression), neuroinflammation (COX-2 expression, NFκB translocation, TNF-α, and IL-10 level) and amyloidogenic protein expression (BACE-1 and Aβ1-42 expression) in STZ (ICV)-injected rats. STZ (ICV)-induced caspase activation and postsynaptic neurotoxicity were also prevented by treatment with intranasal insulin. Our findings reveal that insulin has the neuroprotective effect and clearly signifies the potential use of intranasal insulin delivery for the treatment of AD.

      "abstract": "AIMS: Insulin/insulin receptor signaling is involved in cognitive functions. Clinical studies have shown that intranasal insulin administration improves memory functions. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with improvement in memory functions are largely unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the protective effect of intranasal insulin in intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impairment in rats. MAIN METHODS: Rats were injected with STZ (3mg/kg, ICV) bilaterally twice, on days 1 and 3 and intranasal insulin (2IU/rat/day) was given for 14days. Memory was assessed by Morris water maze test. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. The biochemical and molecular studies were done in cortex and hippocampus of rat brain. KEY FINDINGS: STZ (ICV) administration caused memory impairment along with the reduction of CBF, ATP level, and Nrf-2 expression. Treatment with intranasal insulin significantly improved memory functions as well as restored CBF, ATP content and Nrf-2 expression in STZ injected rats. STZ administration stimulated oxidative-nitrosative stress as evidenced by a significant increase in ROS, malondialdehyde, NO level and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and the decrease in glutathione level; which was normalized by intranasal insulin delivery. STZ-induced cholinergic dysfunction (AChE activity and α7-nAChR expression), and mitochondrial hypofunction was largely prevented by treatment with intranasal insulin. Intranasal insulin delivery successfully restored BDNF level and pCREB expression in STZ injected rats. SIGNIFICANCE: The study shows the beneficial effects of intranasal insulin against STZ-induced memory impairment, which attributed to improved CBF, cholinergic function, brain energy metabolism, BDNF, Nrf-2 expression and antioxidative action.",

      "abstract": "Brain insulin signaling deficits contribute to multiple pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although intranasal insulin has shown efficacy in patients with AD, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unillustrated. Here, we demonstrate that intranasal insulin improves cognitive deficits, ameliorates defective brain insulin signaling, and strongly reduces β-amyloid (Aβ) production and plaque formation after 6 weeks of treatment in 4.5-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. Furthermore, c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, which plays a pivotal role in insulin resistance and AD pathologies, is significantly inhibited. The alleviation of amyloid pathology by intranasal insulin results mainly from enhanced nonamyloidogenic processing and compromised amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and from a reduction in apolipoprotein E protein which is involved in Aβ metabolism. In addition, intranasal insulin effectively promotes hippocampal neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice. This study, exploring the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of intranasal insulin on Aβ pathologies in vivo for the first time, highlights important preclinical evidence that intranasal insulin is potentially an effective therapeutic method for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "In the last years intranasally administered insulin (II) is widely used to treat Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders. Meanwhile, it is little used to treat the type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2); which is due to insufficient knowledge of molecular mechanisms of its action on hormonal and metabolic status of an organism. The effect of II on the activity of hypothalamic signaling systems, which plays a key role in the central regulation of energy metabolism, is still poorly understood. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of five-week treatment of male rats with neonatal model of DM2 using 11 (0.48 IU/rat) on metabolic parameters and on functional activity of the hypothalamic signaling systems. It was shown that treatment of diabetic rats with II'(Group DI) normalized plasma glucose level, restored glucose tolerance and its utilization. In the hypothalamus of rats of the Group DI the-regulatory effects of agonists of type 4 melanocortin receptors (MC4R), type 2 dopamine receptor (D2-DAR) and subtype 1B serotonin receptor (5-HTIBR) on adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, which were reduced in DM2, restored. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of 5-HTIR agonists even was increased as compared to control. In the Group DI, the res- toration of AC regulation by hormones was accompanied by a significant increase in the expression of genes encoding 5-HTIBR and MC4R. Along with this, the attenuation of the AC stimulating effect of D1-DAR agonists and the decreased expression of Drdl gene were found, promoting the enhancement of the negative dopamine effect on AC activity. The II treatment did not significantly affect the expression of genes encoding insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 2, which was reduced, though to a small extent, in the hypothalamus of diabetic rats. Thus, the II treatment of rats with the neonatal model of DM2 partially restores the hypothalamic AC signaling pathways regulated by melanocortins, serotonin and do- pamine, which is one of the mechanisms of positive influence of II on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues.",

Here, we treated mice with daily intranasal administration of insulin (1.75 U/day) for one week before anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of propofol and maintained by inhalation of sevoflurane for 1 hr. We found that the insulin treatment prevented anesthesia-induced deficit in spatial learning and memory, as measured by Morris water maze task during 1-5 days after exposure to anesthesia. The insulin treatment also attenuated anesthesia-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau and promoted the expression of synaptic proteins and insulin signaling in the brain. These findings show a therapeutic potential of intranasal administration of insulin before surgery to reduce the risk of anesthesia-induced cognitive decline and AD.",

      "abstract": "Protection of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) neurons by neurotrophic factors (NTFs) is one of the promising strategies in Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy. A major clinical challenge for NTF-based therapy is that NTFs need to be delivered into the brain via invasive means, which often shows limited delivery efficiency. The nose to brain pathway is a non-invasive brain drug delivery approach developed in recent years. Of particular interest is the finding that intranasal insulin improves cognitive functions in Alzheimer's patients. In vitro, insulin has been shown to protect neurons against various insults. Therefore, the current study was designed to test whether intranasal insulin could afford neuroprotection in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-based rat PD model. 6-OHDA was injected into the right side of striatum to induce a progressive DA neuronal lesion in the ipsilateral SN pars compact (SNc). Recombinant human insulin was applied intranasally to rats starting from 24h post lesion, once per day, for 2 weeks. A battery of motor behavioral tests was conducted on day 8 and 15. The number of DA neurons in the SNc was estimated by stereological counting. Our results showed that 6-OHDA injection led to significant motor deficits and 53% of DA neuron loss in the ipsilateral side of injection. Treatment with insulin significantly ameliorated 6-OHDA-induced motor impairments, as shown by improved locomotor activity, tapered/ledged beam-walking performance, vibrissa-elicited forelimb-placing, initial steps, as well as methamphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Consistent with behavioral improvements, insulin treatment provided a potent protection of DA neurons in the SNc against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity, as shown by a 74.8% increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons compared to the vehicle group. Intranasal insulin treatment did not affect body weight and blood glucose levels. In conclusion, our study showed that intranasal insulin provided strong neuroprotection in the 6-OHDA rat PD model, suggesting that insulin signaling may be a novel therapeutic target in broad neurodegenerative disorders.",

The AC stimulatory effects of β-agonist isoproterenol in animals with obesity and DM2 was shown to be practically unchanged. The respective effects of norepinephrine on the AC activity were attenuated in the brain of young and mature rats and in the myocardium if mature rats, and the I-I treatment led to their partial recovery. In the brain and myocardium of mature rats with obesity and DM2, the enhancement of the AC stimulatory effects of β3-AR agonists was observed, white in young rats the influence of the same pathological conditions was lacking. The I-I treatment decreased the AC stimulatory effects of β3-agonists to their levels in the control. Since functional disruption of the adrenergic agonist-sensitive ACSS can lead to metabolic syndrome and DM2, the recovery of this system by the I-I treatment offers one of the ways to correct these diseases and their complications in the nervous and cardiovascular systems.",

There has also been some correlation between the morbidities associated with central nervous system (CNS) insulin resistance, such as type II diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, and impaired odour recognition. Given that impaired odour recognition is an important component of olfactory performance, mechanisms that govern these effects may account for impaired olfactory functions in anosmic patients. METHODOLOGY: Ten patients with post-infectious olfactory loss received intranasal administration of 40 IU insulin or a placebo solution, as well as olfactory performance tests before and after administration. RESULTS: When administered insulin, patients exhibited an immediate performance improvement with regard to olfactory sensitivity and olfactory intensity ratings. In addition, more odours were correctly identified. Furthermore, an improvement in the odour identification task was detected in patients with higher body mass index. CONCLUSION: Results of this pilot study shed light on the link between cerebral insulin level and an impaired sense of smell. This research line might provide a better understanding of olfactory loss in relation to eating and dietary behavior, and could offer opportunities to develop faster therapeutic intervention for patients with olfactory dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Treatment options for stroke remain limited. Neuroprotective therapies, in particular, have invariably failed to yield the expected benefit in stroke patients, despite robust theoretical and mechanistic background and promising animal data. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) play a pivotal role in critical brain functions, such as energy homeostasis, neuronal growth, and differentiation. They may exhibit neuroprotective properties in acute ischemic stroke based upon their vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects, as well as improvements of functional connectivity, neuronal metabolism, neurotransmitter regulation, and remyelination. Intranasally administered insulin has demonstrated a benefit for prevention of cognitive decline in older people, and IGF-1 has shown potential benefit to improve functional outcomes in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. The intranasal route presents a feasible, tolerable, safe, and particularly effective administration route, bypassing the blood-brain barrier and maximizing distribution to the central nervous system (CNS), without the disadvantages of systemic side effects and first-pass metabolism. This review summarizes the neuroprotective potential of intranasally administered insulin and IGF-1 in stroke patients. We present the theoretical background and pathophysiologic mechanisms, animal and human studies of intranasal insulin and IGF-1, and the safety and feasibility of intranasal route for medication administration to the CNS.",

It was shown that the basal AC activity in rats with obesity and DM2 was increased in the myocardium, and to the lesser extent in the brain, the treatment with II reducing this parameter. The AC stimulating effects of forskolin are decreased in the myocardium, but not in the brain, of rats with obesity and DM2. The treatment with II restored the AC action of forskolin in the 7-month-old animals, but has little effect on it in the 5-month-old rats. In obesity the basal AC activity and its stimulation by forskolin varied insignificantly and weakly changed in treatment of animals with II. The AC inhibitory effects of SST and 5-NOT in the investigated pathology are essentially attenuated, the effect of SST to the greatest extent, which we believe to be associated with a reduction in the functional activity of Gi-proteins. The II treatment of animals with obesity and with a combination of obesity and DM2 restored completely or partially the AC inhibiting effects of hormones, to the greatest extent in the brain. Since impaired functioning of ACSS is one of the causes of the metabolic syndrome and DM2, their elimination by treatments with II can be an effective approach to treat these diseases and their CNS and cardiovascular system complications.",

      "abstract": "The functions of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are attenuated in type 1 diabetes mellitus due to insulin deficiency. The use of intranasally administered insulin is of considerable interest for treatment of diabetes and cognitive disorders, but its effect on the thyroid system has not been investigated yet. We studied the influence of long-term treatment with intranasal insulin on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis of nondiabetic rats and diabetic animals with streptozotocin models of acute and mild type 1 diabetes mellitus. This treatment was carried out for 28 days in acute (daily does of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.5 IU of insulin per rat) and for 135 days in mild diabetes (daily dose of 0.45 IU/rat). Nondiabetic rats were treated in a similar manner. Intranasal insulin in both models of diabetes resulted in the improvement of thyroid status; manifested as increase of thyroid hormones levels and restoration of response to thyroliberin. In acute diabetes, a daily dose of 0.6 IU/rat was the most effective. Twenty eight days treatment of nondiabetic rats with intranasal insulin at a dose of 0.3 IU/rat resulted in a significant increase of free and total thyroxine levels. Longer treatment of rats with mild diabetes and nondiabetic animals significantly increased thyrotropin level. Thus, long-term intranasal insulin treatment restored the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function in type 1 diabetes, but led to a significant increase in the thyrotropin level, which must be considered when designing a strategy for the use of intranasal insulin in clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral insulin resistance is a key component of metabolic syndrome associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. While the impact of insulin resistance is well recognized in the periphery, it is also becoming apparent in the brain. Recent studies suggest that insulin resistance may be a factor in brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) whereby intranasal insulin therapy, which delivers insulin to the brain, improves cognition and memory in AD patients. Here, we tested a clinically relevant delivery method to determine the impact of two forms of insulin, short-acting insulin lispro (Humalog) or long-acting insulin detemir (Levemir), on cognitive functions in aged F344 rats. We also explored insulin effects on the Ca(2+)-dependent hippocampal afterhyperpolarization (AHP), a well-characterized neurophysiological marker of aging which is increased in the aged, memory impaired animal. Low-dose intranasal insulin improved memory recall in aged animals such that their performance was similar to that seen in younger animals. Further, because ex vivo insulin also reduced the AHP, our results suggest that the AHP may be a novel cellular target of insulin in the brain, and improved cognitive performance following intranasal insulin therapy may be the result of insulin actions on the AHP.",

A subject-specific linear mixed effects model for the primary outcome developmental age in a longitudinal setting with five time points was assumed. Monte Carlo simulation studies with small sample sizes were applied since the rare disorder prohibits large trials. The stepped wedge designs, which were initially preferred for ethical reasons, appear to be competitive in power to other designs and were in some settings even the best. The assumed statistical model also demonstrates that all of the designs can be viewed as a stepped wedge or delayed treatment design. Our results show that the stepped wedge design is an appropriate alternative for randomized controlled trials on developmental growth with small numbers of participants under the formulated statistical conditions.",

      "abstract": "Previous trials have shown promising effects of intranasally administered insulin for adults with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These trials used regular insulin, which has a shorter half-life compared to long-lasting insulin analogues such as insulin detemir. The current trial examined whether intranasal insulin detemir improves cognition or daily functioning for adults with MCI or AD. Sixty adults diagnosed with MCI or mild to moderate AD received placebo (n = 20), 20 IU of insulin detemir (n = 21), or 40 IU of insulin detemir (n = 19) for 21 days, administered with a nasal drug delivery device. Results revealed a treatment effect for the memory composite for the 40 IU group compared with placebo (p < 0.05). This effect was moderated by APOE status (p < 0.05), reflecting improvement for APOE-ε4 carriers (p < 0.02), and worsening for non-carriers (p < 0.02). Higher insulin resistance at baseline predicted greater improvement with the 40 IU dose (r = 0.54, p < 0.02). Significant treatment effects were also apparent for verbal working memory (p < 0.03) and visuospatial working memory (p < 0.04), reflecting improvement for subjects who received the high dose of intranasal insulin detemir. No significant differences were found for daily functioning or executive functioning. In conclusion, daily treatment with 40 IU insulin detemir modulated cognition for adults with AD or MCI, with APOE-related differences in treatment response for the primary memory composite. Future research is needed to examine the mechanistic basis of APOE-related treatment differences, and to further assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal insulin detemir.",

Intranasal insulin has emerged as a promising intervention for treatment of cognitive impairment. We evaluated the acute effects of intranasal insulin on resting-state brain functional connectivity in older adults with T2DM. This proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of a single 40 IU dose of insulin or saline in 14 diabetic and 14 control subjects. Resting-state functional connectivity between the hippocampal region and default mode network (DMN) was quantified using functional MRI (fMRI) at 3Tesla. Following insulin administration, diabetic patients demonstrated increased resting-state connectivity between the hippocampal regions and the medial frontal cortex (MFC) as compared with placebo (cluster size: right, P = 0.03) and other DMN regions. On placebo, the diabetes group had lower connectivity between the hippocampal region and the MFC as compared with control subjects (cluster size: right, P = 0.02), but on insulin, MFC connectivity was similar to control subjects. Resting-state connectivity correlated with cognitive performance. A single dose of intranasal insulin increases resting-state functional connectivity between the hippocampal regions and multiple DMN regions in older adults with T2DM. Intranasal insulin administration may modify functional connectivity among brain regions regulating memory and complex cognitive behaviors.",

We found that intranasal insulin restored insulin signaling, increased the levels of synaptic proteins, and reduced Aβ40 level and microglia activation in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. However, this treatment did not affect the levels of glucose transporters and O-GlcNAcylation or tau phosphorylation.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether central nervous insulin delivery suppresses lipolysis in healthy humans. DESIGN: Placebo-controlled, balanced within-subject comparisons were performed in both a main and an independent corroborative experiment. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTION: Two groups of healthy volunteers were examined at the German University Clinics of Lübeck and Tübingen, respectively, with molecular analyses taking place at Mt Sinai School of Medicine (New York, New York). The 14 healthy male subjects of the main study and the 22 women and 5 men of the corroborative study each received 160 IU of human insulin intranasally. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In the main study, we measured systemic levels of free fatty acids (FFAs), triglycerides, and glycerol and the rate of appearance of deuterated glycerol as an estimate of lipolysis before and after intranasal insulin administration. We also analyzed the expression of key lipolytic enzymes in sc fat biopsies and measured blood glucose and glucoregulatory hormones. In the corroborative study, FFA concentrations were assessed before and after intranasal insulin administration. RESULTS: In the main experiment, intranasal insulin suppressed circulating FFA concentrations and lipolysis (rate of appearance of deuterated glycerol) in the absence of significant changes in circulating insulin levels. Lipolytic protein expression in sc adipose tissue was not affected. The corroborative study confirmed that intranasal insulin lowers systemic FFA concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that brain insulin controls systemic lipolysis in healthy humans by predominantly acting on non-sc adipose tissue.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence supports the concept that insulin resistance plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration, including in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The metabolic hypothesis has led to the development and utilization of insulin- and insulin agonist-based treatments. Therapeutic challenges faced include the ability to provide effective treatments that do not require repeated injections and also the ability to minimize the potentially hazardous off-target effects. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the role of intranasal insulin therapy for cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration, particularly AD. The literature reviewed focuses on data published within the past 5 years as this field is evolving rapidly. The review provides evidence that brain insulin resistance is an important and early abnormality in AD, and that increasing brain supply and utilization of insulin improves cognition and memory. Emphasis was placed on discussing outcomes of clinical trials and interpreting discordant results to clarify the benefits and limitations of intranasal insulin therapy. EXPERT OPINION: Intranasal insulin therapy can efficiently and directly target the brain to support energy metabolism, myelin maintenance, cell survival and neuronal plasticity, which begin to fail in the early stages of neurodegeneration. Efforts must continue toward increasing the safety, efficacy and specificity of intranasal insulin therapy.",
