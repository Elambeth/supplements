      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the effects of probiotic implantation to the dorsum of the tongue against halitosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 participants were randomly divided into three groups as tongue back scraping (TS), probiotic implantation to the dorsum of the tongue (PB) and mouthwash alone as the control group (MW). Measurements were taken before the treatment, after the first month of treatment and one month after the cessation of treatment. RESULTS: Halimeter, winkel and woodlight scores were evaluated initially, in the first month and after the cessation of the treatment. All of MW measurements showed no difference throughout the study. All of TS measurements decreased significantly in the first month (p < 0.05) but rose again in the final count. All of PB measurements significantly decreased in the first month and kept their low levels after the cessation of the treatment (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Probiotics and tongue scraping are widely used against halitosis but they are not intended to be used together. In this study, we proposed and proved an effective method of probiotic implantation by tongue scraping and showed that halitosis did not recur after the cessation of the treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Halitosis is used to describe any disagreeable odour of expired air regardless of its origin. Mouthwashes which disguise oral malodor are more socially acceptable and generally more popular than tongue scrapers. OBJECTIVES: To provide reliable evidence regarding the effectiveness of tongue scraping versus other interventions (including mouthwashes) to control halitosis. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 15th September 2005); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3 2005); MEDLINE 1966 to September Week 1 2005; EMBASE 1974 to September 2005 (searched September 19th 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing different methods of tongue cleaning to reduce mouth odour in adults with halitosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Clinical heterogeneity between the two included trials precluded pooling of data, therefore a descriptive summary is presented. MAIN RESULTS: This review included two trials involving 40 participants. Both trials were methodologically sound but included no data for the primary outcomes specified in this review. Secondary outcomes expressed as volatile sulfur compound (VSC) levels were assessed by a portable sulfide monitor in both trials. One trial showed reductions of VSC levels of 42% with the tongue cleaner, 40% with the tongue scraper and 33% with the toothbrush. Reduced VSC levels persisted longer with the tongue cleaner than the toothbrush and could not be detected for more than 30 minutes after the intervention in any of the groups. Differences were assessed by the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank tests with the level of significance set at P < 0.05. The second trial, in which differences in totaled rank values between groups were compared by the Dunn method alpha = 0.01, showed a reduction of VSC levels compared with baseline measurements of 75% with the tongue scraper and 45% with the toothbrush. Adverse effects in one trial were nausea (60%) and trauma (10%) with the toothbrush and all participants receptive to using the tongue scraper. Based on the independent data from these two trials there was a statistically significant difference between the effectiveness of either the tongue cleaner or the tongue scraper in reducing VSC levels when compared with the toothbrush. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is weak and unreliable evidence to show that there is a small but statistically significant difference in reduction of VSC levels when tongue scrapers or cleaners rather than toothbrushes are used to reduce halitosis in adults. We found no high level evidence comparing mechanical with other forms of tongue cleaning.",

      "abstract": "Mutans streptococci (MS) are one of the most virulent cariogenic pathogens in the oral cavity. The effects of three oral hygiene techniques on salivary mutans streptococci levels were evaluated to see which mechanism would be most efficient in reducing salivary MS levels. Sixty patients, all in the permanent dentition, were selected and randomly distributed into three groups. Group I was asked to use a tongue scraper to brush the tongue once daily in the morning after normal tooth brushing routine. Group II was asked to place and let dissolve a Listerine Oral Care Strip on the tongue once daily after normal oral hygiene routine. Group III was asked to rinse once every morning, for thirty seconds, with a saturated saline solution after routine tooth brushing. The instructions were done for a period of seven days. Baseline, one hour, three day, and seven day saliva samples were obtained and plated on CRT\" by Vivadent MS-sensitive agar. All treatments groups show a significant reduction in colony counts from baseline and one or more post treatment periods and at one or more time periods between treatment groups. The most effective treatment in reducing colony counts was seen within Group I \"Tongue Scraping\" which demonstrated the greatest change from baseline to each of the post treatment periods. The least effective was Group II \"Listerine Strip\" which showed a statistically insignificant increase in colony count from baseline to 1-Hour and a significant decrease from baseline at the 7-day period only.",
