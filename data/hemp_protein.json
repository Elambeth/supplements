      "abstract": "This study investigated the covalent conjugation of hemp protein isolate (HPI) with curcumin induced by ultrasound-generated free radicals and its impact on HPI's structural and functional properties. Ultrasound treatment unfolded the protein structure, increased free amino and sulfhydryl groups, and altered the secondary structure. Curcumin addition enhanced free radical scavenging capacity. Conjugation with curcumin significantly improved emulsifying activity index (+ 2.6-fold), foam stability (+ 1.8-fold), and solubility (+ 0.9-fold) and further enhanced free radical scavenging capability (+ 2.4 or 2.7-fold). Conjugation with curcumin also enabled gel formation, as evidenced by a continuous increase in the storage modulus of HPI during heating and cooling. These findings highlight the potential of HPI-curcumin conjugates as healthy ingredients in functional food applications."

      "abstract": "To improve the emulsion gel system of single soybean isolate protein (SPI) and to broaden the application field of hemp protein isolate (HPI), ultrasonic treatment and HPI were introduced to improve the properties of SPI emulsion gel and to explore the mechanism. The results showed that the gel strength (218.6 g) and water-holding capacity (86.24 %) of the emulsion gels were improved under ultrasonic treatments when the ratio of SPI:HPI was >6:4, and the reticulation structure of the gels was enhanced. When the ratio of SPI:HPI was <6:4, the gel structure was loose and formless. Ultrasonic treatment has a significant effect on the emulsion gel with the ratio of SPI:HPI was >6:4. Appropriate ultrasonic treatment (400 W) changed the protein structure, improved the rheological properties of emulsion gels to form the protein-oil-coated network structure. However, excessive ultrasonic treatment (600 W) will destroy the conformation of the protein, reducing the stability of the structure. The effect of ultrasonic treatment on emulsion gels with the ratio of SPI:HPI was <6:4 is low, but improved the gel protein digestibility. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of ultrasonic in composite protein emulsion gels systems and the development and application of HPI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The process of Maillard conjugation occurs with plant proteins and sugars and can be influenced by several factors, such as processing time, pH, and shear force. By utilizing cavitation processes such as high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and pH-shifting, it is possible to regulate the degree of grafting, functional characteristics, and structural changes in the formation of conjugates. The present study aimed to improve the hemp protein concentrate (HPC) through two different conjugation techniques: HPH and pH-shifting-assisted processes. RESULTS: The best conjugation conditions for the conventional method were identified as a 1:2 HPC to xylose ratio, a pH of 10, and 3 h of treatment at 70 °C. The use of HPH and pH 12-shifting methods resulted in a remarkable 2.5-fold increase in grafting degree, requiring less processing time. Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed the formation of conjugates. Conjugates produced through HPH with pH 12-shifting (MPHX) transformed into soluble glycoproteins with a particle size of 74 nm. MPHX solubility increased by 5.7-fold than HPC, reaching 85.7%, with a more negatively charged surface at -32.4 mV. Microimages showed cracked and sharp forms for conjugated proteins compared to untreated HPC. Additionally, MPHX conjugates demonstrated superior properties in emulsion stability, foaming capacity, and antioxidant activity compared to HPC and classical conjugates. CONCLUSION: The use of HPH and pH-shifting-assisted Maillard conjugation was highly effective in enhancing the functional attributes of hemp protein conjugates. © 2024 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Plant protein is considered a sustainable health-promoting strategy to prevent metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes (including dietary patterns and exercise) have been demonstrated to exert an effect on human health by modulating the biochemical status in humans. The objective of this study was to assess whether supplementation with hemp protein within a Mediterranean diet context together with exercise could help to ameliorate the metabolic statuses of patients prone to developing metabolic syndrome. For this study, 23 patients followed with Mediterranean diet and engaged in aerobic exercise according to the WHO's recommendations, while also being supplemented with hemp protein, for 12 weeks. A comparison of anthropometric, biochemical, and mineral data as well as amino acid values was made between the start and the end of the study, with the subjects acting as their own control group. Statistical analyses included a paired t-test, Wilcoxon paired test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis to evaluate significant differences and correlations among parameters. There were statistically significant changes in total cholesterol, HDL-C (+52.3%), LDL-C (-54.0%), and TAG levels (-49.8%), but not in glucose plasma levels. Following the intervention, plasma concentrations of some amino acids, including α-aminoadipic acid, phosphoethanolamine, and 1-metylhistidine, increased, whereas those of asparagine and alanine declined. Different correlations between amino acids and the other parameters evaluated were reported and discussed. A Mediterranean diet combined with regular aerobic exercise, together with protein supplementation, can highly improve the metabolic parameters and anthropometric parameters of subjects with obesity and impaired glucose levels, ameliorating their health status and likely delaying the development of metabolic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is well known that hemp proteins have the disadvantages of poor solubility and poor emulsification. To improve these shortcomings, an alkali covalent cross-linking method was used to prepare hemp protein isolate-epigallocatechin-3-gallate biopolymer (HPI-EGCG) and the effects of different heat treatment conditions on the structure and emulsifying properties of the HPI-EGCG covalent complex were studied. RESULTS: The secondary and tertiary structures, solubility, and emulsification ability of the HPI-EGCG complexes were evaluated using particle size, zeta potential, circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy indices. The results showed that the absolute value of zeta potential of HPI-EGCG covalent complex was the largest, 18.6 mV, and the maximum binding amount of HPI to EGCG was 29.18 μmol g-1 . Under heat treatment at 25-35 °C, the α-helix content was reduced from 1.87% to 0%, and the β-helix content was reduced from 82.79% to 0% after the covalent binding of HPI and EGCG. The solubility and emulsification properties of the HPI-EGCG covalent complexes were improved significantly, and the emulsification activity index (EAI) and emulsion stability index (ESI) were increased by 2.77-fold and 1.21-fold, respectively. CONCLUSION: A new HPI-EGCG covalent complex was developed in this study to provide a theoretical basis for the application of HPI-EGCG in food industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "A prolonged inflammatory response can lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Enzymatic hydrolysis is a sustainable way to increase the value of protein sources by obtaining peptides that can exert bioactivity. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) protein hydrolysates have been proven to exert anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, two hemp protein hydrolysate (HPHs), obtained with Alcalase as sole catalyst, or with Alcalase followed by Flavourzyme, were evaluated as inflammatory mediators (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10), microglial polarization markers (Ccr7, iNos, Arg1, and Ym1), and genes related to inflammasome activation (Nlrp3, Asc, Casp1, and Il18), employing the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation model in murine BV-2 microglial cells. A significant decrease of the expression of proinflammatory genes (e.g., Tnfα, Ccr7, inos, and Nlrp3, among others) and increase of the expression anti-inflammatory cytokines in microglial cells was observed after treatment with the test HPHs. This result in the cell model suggests a polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Our results show that the evaluated HPHs show potential neuroprotective activity in microglial cells via the inflammasome."

      "abstract": "Research investigating hemp protein consumption on glycemic response is limited. The effects of hemp protein consumption on blood glucose (BG), insulin, and satiety compared with soybean protein and a carbohydrate control were examined. Two acute randomized repeated-measures crossover experiments were conducted. In both, participants consumed the following isocaloric treatments: 40 g of hemp protein (hemp40), 20 g of hemp protein (hemp20), 40 g of soybean protein (soy40), 20 g of soybean protein (soy20), and a carbohydrate control. In experiments 1 (n = 27) and 2 (n = 16), appetite and BG were measured before (0-60 min, pre-pizza) and after a pizza meal (80-200 min, post-pizza). In experiment 1, food intake was measured at 60 min by ad libitum meal; in experiment 2 a fixed meal was provided (based on body weight) and insulin was measured pre-pizza and post-pizza. In both experiments, BG response was affected by treatment (p < 0.01), time (p < 0.001) and time-by-treatment (p < 0.001) from 0-200 min. Protein treatments lowered 0-60-min BG overall mean and area under the curve compared with control (p < 0.05) dose-dependently. In experiment 2, hemp40 and soy40 lowered (p < 0.05) overall mean insulin concentrations compared with hemp20, soy20, and control pre-meal. Results suggest that hemp protein, like soybean, dose-dependently lowers postprandial BG and insulin concentrations compared with a carbohydrate control. Clinical trial registry: NCT02366598 (experiment 1) and NCT02458027 (experiment 2). Novelty: Hemp protein concentrate dose-dependently leads to lower postprandial BG response compared with a carbohydrate control. No differences were seen between hemp and soy protein.",
