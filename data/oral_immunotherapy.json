      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) has shown great potential for the treatment of food allergy. However, there is no global consensus on best practices for OIT. Parents of allergic children often struggle with concerns regarding OIT methodology, safety and lack of accessible educational resources. ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognized for its ability to formulate human-like conversations. While applications of AI in medical settings continue to be explored, the effectiveness of ChatGPT as an educational resource remains unknown for OIT. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of ChatGPT as a self-guided educational resource for parents with children undergoing OIT. METHODS: Fourteen common questions from parents regarding OIT were entered into ChatGPT-3.5, and answers were copied verbatim. These responses were then categorized into basic, advanced, or medical and evaluated by Allergy-Immunology healthcare practitioners from North America and the United Kingdom using a 10-point Likert scale. Response readability, understandability and reproducibility were assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade level scores, the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool and natural language processing tools, respectively. RESULTS: The average median rankings by the practitioners per category were 8.6, 8.4 and 7.8 for basic, advanced and medical, respectively. ChatGPT responses exhibited low readability scores, corresponding with a high-grade reading level. Understandability was between 73-84%, with scores decreased due to response complexity. When assessing reproducibility, ChatGPT responses achieved rates between 83 to 93%. CONCLUSION: Our results show that ChatGPT provides intelligible and comprehensive responses to patient questions. Healthcare practitioners polled were generally positive, but identified important limitations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) has shown effectiveness in achieving desensitization of children; however, evidence in adults is lacking. METHODS: This phase II trial evaluated peanut OIT in peanut-allergic adults using real-world peanut products. A Simon's minimax two-stage design, incorporating a stop:go for futility, was employed. A separate untreated control group was also recruited for comparison of mechanistic parameters. Participants underwent baseline double-blind placebo-control food challenges (DBPCFC) with peanut protein doses of 0.3 to 300 mg. Reacting participants were initiated on daily OIT with 2-weekly updosing until reaching a maintenance dose of 1000 mg (four large peanuts). The primary outcome was the proportion of OIT participants who tolerated a cumulative dose of 1.4 g peanut protein during exit DBPCFC (doses provided 0.3-3000 mg). RESULTS: Twenty-one adults (8 female; mean age 24.2 years [SD 4.9]) were enrolled in the OIT group, with 67% achieving the daily maintenance dose and meeting the primary endpoint. Three withdrew due to adverse reactions, and a further three did not complete the trial for reasons unrelated to OIT. The median tolerated dose increased from 30 mg (equivalent to approximately 1/8th of a peanut) to 3000 mg (12 peanuts) at the exit challenge, representing a 100-fold increase (p < 0.0001). OIT was associated with an improvement in QoL measures. Suppression of peanut skin prick test sizes and induction of peanut-specific IgG were observed in OIT but not in control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Peanut OIT appears to be an efficacious treatment for adults with peanut allergy. Further studies are needed for confirmation and to characterize safety profiles in different adult subgroups.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is increasingly popular as a treatment strategy for food allergy. Unfortunately, there is significant heterogeneity in reported outcomes, specifically in the dose-thresholds selected for evaluation and the symptoms used to define a \"tolerated dose\". These considerations are often investigator-driven and do not consider patient perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review by the EAACI CO-FAITH taskforce recently flagged the need to better standardize and harmonize outcomes used in clinical trials of food-AIT. Using less objective symptoms to define dose-limiting symptoms can underestimate the reaction threshold determined at baseline food challenge. As a consequence, this can overestimate the efficacy of food-AIT by 15%. In this review, we perform an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis using data from three randomized-controlled trials and one real-world registry, to evaluate how the definition of dose \"tolerance\" impacts upon reported desensitization rates. SUMMARY: This analysis provides insight into how clinical efficacy rates for food-AIT are impacted by using different dose thresholds and definitions for when a dose might be consider tolerated. Using more patient-centric outcomes may be a more useful metric to harmonize reporting of outcomes and inform clinical practice, paving the way towards reaching a consensus on outcome reporting in trials of food-AIT.",

      "abstract": "Background: Food allergies are a growing global health concern, particularly among children, with no widely approved curative treatment beyond strict allergen avoidance. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has emerged as a promising strategy to induce desensitization, yet its implementation is limited due to high rates of allergic reactions and patient non-compliance. Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, has been proposed as an adjunct to OIT to enhance safety and efficacy. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in combination with OIT for IgE-mediated food allergy in children. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Central databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and observational studies assessing omalizumab as an adjunct to OIT in pediatric food allergy. Studies were evaluated for desensitization rates, immunological changes, adverse events, and quality-of-life improvements. Results: OIT combined with omalizumab led to significantly higher rates of desensitization, allowing patients to tolerate higher doses of allergens in a shorter timeframe compared to OIT alone. Omalizumab was associated with a reduction in adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, and improved treatment adherence. However, the long-term sustainability of tolerance post-omalizumab discontinuation remains uncertain. Conclusions: Omalizumab facilitates rapid and effective desensitization in pediatric food allergy, enhancing the safety of OIT. Further research is needed to determine optimal treatment duration, long-term outcomes, and cost-effectiveness before widespread clinical adoption."

This combined strategy aims to enhance both the safety and effectiveness of the process, which seeks to induce immunological tolerance to food allergens, while reducing the risk of severe allergic reactions during treatment. The use of omalizumab helps prevent anaphylaxis and improves the patient's ability to tolerate the allergen. Rapid desensitization offers significant time and cost savings. As more scientific evidence supports rapid food desensitization, it could become a valuable tool for clinicians managing food-induced anaphylaxis, offering a promising avenue for the treatment of food allergies, especially in complex cases."

Current Canadian clinical practice guidelines for OIT recommend this form of therapy as an option in patients with food allergy. The intervention should be prioritized in the infant and toddler population, in which it is particularly well tolerated and can lead to sustained unresponsiveness (also sometimes referred to as remission).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approved therapeutics for peanut allergy are not designed for the many patients with allergic reactions to more than one peanut. METHODS: We randomly assigned (1:1) participants 4 to 14 years of age reacting to a challenge of between 443 mg and 5043 mg of peanut protein to peanut oral immunotherapy (P-OIT) using home-measured peanut butter versus peanut avoidance. The primary end point was the difference between groups in the proportion tolerating a two-dose-level increase or 9043 mg of peanut protein. For ingestion participants tolerating 9043 mg, sustained unresponsiveness (tolerance off treatment) was tested after 16 weeks of ad lib ingestion followed by 8 weeks of abstinence. RESULTS: Of 73 participants, 38 were randomly assigned to P-OIT and 35 to avoidance. Thirty-two of 38 participants in the ingestion group (84.2%) and 30 of 35 in the avoidance group (85.7%) underwent the primary outcome food challenge. The primary analysis with prespecified multiple imputation for missing values showed 100% success for ingestion versus 21.0% for avoidance (between-group difference, 79.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 64.6 to 93.5; P<0.001). All 32 treated and 3 out of 30 avoiders (10%) tolerated 9043 mg. In the intention-to-treat analysis, sustained unresponsiveness occurred in 68.4% (26/38) on P-OIT versus 8.6% (3/35) tolerating 9043 mg among those avoiding (between-group difference, 59.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 42.4 to 77.3). No dosing reactions were greater than grade 1 severity, and no serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial of P-OIT using store-bought, home-measured peanut versus peanut avoidance in high-threshold peanut allergy, those treated achieved significantly higher rates of desensitization with a durable response off treatment.

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous, sublingual, oral specific immunotherapy in patients who suffer from allergic conditions to pollen from trees, grasses and weeds, house dust mites and Alternaria alternata spores. A literature search was performed separately for each type of allergen and each administration route of the drug. As a result, it was found that all administration routes were quite effective. However, each type of immunotherapy was most effective for certain allergens. Subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy have proven effective for aeroallergens such as pollen from grass, trees, weeds and house dust mites. Despite this, subcutaneous immunotherapy had a number of disadvantages in the form of the duration of treatment and a greater prevalence of side effects. Some authors suggest that for allergies to house dust mites, the most effective method of immunotherapy was the subcutaneous method of administration, compared with sublingual and nasal. Sublingual therapy was safe enough for all types of allergens under study, however, to achieve the same effect as the subcutaneous method of administration. In addition, oral immunotherapy has been shown to be effective for food allergies with obvious symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders. In addition, oral immunotherapy is the only approved treatment for allergies in the elderly, due to the low risk of side effects. The time-accelerated and dosage-enhanced immunotherapy was also effective and safe. These data prove the effectiveness and safety of each administration route of specific allergens for specific immunotherapy in patients suffering from allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma and even atopic dermatitis.",

Treatment with oral immunotherapy (OIT) has shown efficacy, but high rates of adverse reactions. The aim of this study was to determine whether baked milk OIT (BMOIT) could reduce adverse reactions while still inducing desensitization, and to identify immunological correlates of successful BMOIT.METHODSThis phase II, randomized trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of BMOIT in milk-allergic children 3-18 years old. After the initial placebo-controlled first year of treatment, placebo-treated participants crossed over to active BMOIT. Double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenges (OFCs) were conducted with BM after year 1 and to both BM and unheated milk (UM) after year 2. IgG and IgE antibodies were measured along with CM-specific (CM+) CD4+ memory T cell populations, profiled using flow cytometry and scRNA-Seq.RESULTSTwenty-one of 30 (70%) reached the primary endpoint of tolerating 4044 mg of BM protein at month 24, and 11 of 30 tolerated 2000 mg or more of UM protein. Dosing symptoms were common, but more than 98% were mild, with no severe reactions. Immunological changes associated with desensitization included increased CM IgG4, CM+ FOXP3+ cells, and Tregs and corresponding decreases in CM IgE, CM+ Th2A cells, and CD154+ cells. T cell and antibody measurements were combined to build a model that predicted UM OFC outcomes.CONCLUSIONBMOIT was well tolerated and induced desensitization to BM and UM. This desensitization corresponded to redistribution within antigen-specific antibody and T cell compartments that provided insight into the mechanistic changes that occur with OIT treatment.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT03462030.FUNDING: Myra Reinhardt Family Foundation (grant number 128388), NIH/NIAID (U19AI135731, T32AI125179, S10OD025052).",

Early initiation of OIT in infants and toddlers has been embraced as an approach to increase the likelihood of remission. However, there is no high-quality evidence supporting younger age as an independent factor driving remission; available studies are limited by small samples of younger subjects and lack of adjustment for confounding covariates, particularly peanut-specific IgE (sIgE) levels which is closely correlated with age. METHODS: This study examined relationships between peanut sIgE and age at baseline and remission, in children aged 1-10 who completed 18 months of OIT in the PPOIT-003 RCT (n = 162). Remission was defined as absence of clinical reactivity to peanut after 8 weeks of allergen avoidance/treatment discontinuation. Age and sIgE were examined as continuous variables in univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Higher peanut sIgE was consistently predictive of lower likelihood of remission, independent of age. In contrast, there was no independent association between age and remission after adjusting for baseline sIgE (OR 0.94 [0.79-1.12], p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Findings do not support age as an independent predictor of remission following OIT. Additional studies examining safety and efficacy of OIT in infants and younger children are urgently needed, ahead of widespread adoption of early intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Egg oral immunotherapy (OIT) can induce desensitization or remission of egg allergy in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of OIT for raw egg allergy in school-age children compared with egg avoidance, and the most cost-effective age at which to commence treatment. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model estimated the health and cost outcomes of 1,000 children aged 4 years with egg allergy, comparing different ages of OIT commencement (ages 4-12, inclusive) versus ongoing egg avoidance. Years lived with egg allergy, egg tolerance or remission (natural and OIT-induced), and desensitization to egg were captured, with rates of allergic reactions and utility values assigned to each health state. Treatment effects were derived from published randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the Australian health care payer perspective (costs in Australian dollars per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained), with a 20-year time horizon, 5% annual discounting, and an AU $50,000/QALY willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. RESULTS: Without OIT, 858 children attained natural resolution before age 24. Under conservative assumptions, with OIT-induced remission set at zero and 84% achieving desensitization, ICERs were below the WTP threshold for treatment commencement at age 8 or older, with the smallest ICER observed at age 12 (AU $43,233/QALY; 95% CI, 32,025-73,350). However, the cost-effectiveness of OIT was achieved at all ages (ICER less than the WTP threshold) when OIT-induced remission increased to ∼40% of treated children. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current published evidence, the cost-effectiveness of egg OIT improves with increased age of treatment commencement. Cost-effectiveness increases when the proportion of children achieving OIT-induced remission increases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peanut allergy is a common, life-threatening food allergy in children. We evaluated whether dupilumab, which blocks the activity of interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13, enhances the efficacy of oral immunotherapy (OIT) AR101 in pediatric patients with peanut allergy. METHODS: A Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in the USA (NCT03682770) in pediatric patients (6-≤ 17 years old) with confirmed peanut allergy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive dupilumab + OIT or placebo + OIT during a 28-40-week up-dosing period. Patients in the dupilumab + OIT group were re-randomized 1:1 and received dupilumab + OIT or placebo + OIT during 24-week OIT maintenance, undergoing a 2044 mg (cumulative) of peanut protein double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) following up-dosing, maintenance, and at 12-week post-treatment follow-up. RESULTS: The study enrolled 148 patients, 123 of whom were included in the modified full analysis set, with a mean age of 11.1 years. Dupilumab + OIT treatment (n = 84) led to a 20.2% increase (p < 0.05) in the number of patients who passed a DBPCFC to 2044 mg (cumulative) of peanut protein following the up-dosing period versus placebo (OIT alone, n = 39). Following the OIT maintenance period, continuous dupilumab treatment improved the number of patients who passed a DBPCFC to 2044 mg (cumulative) of peanut protein versus patients continuously on OIT alone (16.6% difference [95% CI -9.7, 42.8], p = 0.2123). Safety was consistent with known dupilumab safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: Dupilumab provided a modest increase efficacy of OIT in children and adolescents with peanut allergy, though it did not provide protection against OIT-related anaphylaxis.

      "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is increasingly used for the treatment of childhood food allergies, with limited data available on cashew nut OIT. This real-life study investigated the safety and feasibility of cashew nut OIT, comparing it with peanut OIT, with a focus on the up-dosing process. METHODS: We analysed cashew nut (n = 24) and peanut (n = 38) OIT cases with treatment initiated between 2018 and 2022 at the University Children's Hospital Basel. All patients who commenced therapy within this time frame were enrolled without prior selection. Two different starting protocols were used. Within the up-dosing protocol, the nut intake was incrementally increased by 20-30% every 2 weeks until reaching a maintenance dose of 1 g of nut protein. After consuming the maintenance dose regularly for 18-24 months, a second oral food challenge was performed. Patients who passed this challenge were considered desensitised. The safety of the therapy was evaluated based on the severity of adverse reactions during the up-dosing phase. Symptom severity was evaluated using the validated ordinal food allergy severity scale (o-FASS-5). RESULTS: Over the study period, 33% of cashew nut-allergic and 63% of peanut-allergic patients experienced mild to moderate allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions occurred in five peanut-allergic children with high baseline allergen-specific IgE levels. Six patients with peanut, and none with cashew nut OIT, discontinued the therapy due to adverse reactions. The mean duration to reach the maintenance phase was longer for children with asthma or another food allergy. Among children who already underwent the second oral food challenge, desensitisation was achieved in 91% (11 out of 12) of cashew nut- and 73% (11 out of 15) of peanut-allergic patients. CONCLUSION: Cashew nut OIT had a low severity of adverse reactions and was generally well-tolerated. However, patient characteristics influenced side effect risk and treatment duration, emphasising the need for individualised OIT strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The immunometabolic mechanisms underlying variable responses to oral immunotherapy (OIT) in patients with IgE-mediated food allergy are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify novel pathways associated with tolerance in food allergy, we used metabolomic profiling to find pathways important for food allergy in multiethnic cohorts and responses to OIT. METHODS: Untargeted plasma metabolomics data were generated from the VDAART healthy infant cohort (N = 384), a Costa Rican cohort of children with asthma (N = 1040), and a peanut OIT trial (N = 20) evaluating sustained unresponsiveness (SU, protection that lasts after therapy) versus transient desensitization (TD, protection that ends immediately afterward). Generalized linear regression modeling and pathway enrichment analysis identified metabolites associated with food allergy and OIT outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with unaffected children, those with food allergy were more likely to have metabolomic profiles with altered histidines and increased bile acids. Eicosanoids (e.g., arachidonic acid derivatives) (q = 2.4 × 10-20) and linoleic acid derivatives (q = 3.8 × 10-5) pathways decreased over time on OIT. Comparing SU versus TD revealed differing concentrations of bile acids (q = 4.1 × 10-8), eicosanoids (q = 7.9 × 10-7), and histidine pathways (q = .015). In particular, the bile acid lithocholate (4.97 [1.93, 16.14], p = .0027), the eicosanoid leukotriene B4 (3.21 [1.38, 8.38], p = .01), and the histidine metabolite urocanic acid (22.13 [3.98, 194.67], p = .0015) were higher in SU. CONCLUSIONS: We observed distinct profiles of bile acids, histidines, and eicosanoids that vary among patients with food allergy, over time on OIT and between SU and TD. Participants with SU had higher levels of metabolites such as lithocholate and urocanic acid, which have immunomodulatory roles in key T-cell subsets, suggesting potential mechanisms of tolerance in immunotherapy.",

A total of 183 children with FA and 27 non-allergic siblings were recruited to date in the Zéro allergie cohort (ZAC) to better understand biological mechanisms underlying FA and OIT prognosis. The primary aims are to (a) better understand the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and microbial diversity associated with FA; (b) establish the multi-omics and microbial diversity profiles of children following OIT to identify predictive prognosis biomarkers, (c) make OIT more accessible to the population of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, and (d) build a biobank of data and biological material. RESULTS: The ZAC constitutes a unique and rich biobank of biological samples (blood, buccal swabs, microbiota samples [intestinal, buccal, nasal, and cutaneous]) combined with clinical data and more than 75 phenotypic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: This represents an innovative interdisciplinary initiative by researchers, allergists, and paediatricians to make FA care accessible to a greater number of children with IgE-mediated FA. Ultimately, it will contribute to provide more accessible treatment options with greater chances of success through a better understanding of the biological nature of FA and OIT."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an increasingly utilized management strategy for IgE-mediated food allergy. Despite promising efficacy and effectiveness, there is still a lack of data surrounding the reasons for discontinuation of OIT. The primary reason stated in the literature for discontinuation is adverse gastrointestinal effects. Social factors contributing to OIT discontinuation have not been well reported. We hypothesize that social considerations are significant contributors to treatment discontinuation. METHODS: We completed a retrospective chart review of 50 patients treated in community pediatric allergy practices who discontinued OIT out of 507 patients who were started on OIT between October 1, 2017-October 27, 2022. Reasons for discontinuation were identified and classified into five main categories: unsafe care decisions, anxiety, adverse effects of OIT, uncontrolled comorbidity and social factors. Categories were not exclusive. RESULTS: 507 patients were started on OIT, with data available for 50 patients who discontinued OIT, aged 10 months to 18 years and 2 months. The overall discontinuation rate was 9.8%, of which 40 patients (80%) discontinued during buildup, 9 patients (18%) discontinued during maintenance and one patient on two food OIT discontinued one food during buildup and one during maintenance (2%). Thirty-four patients (68%) had multiple reasons for discontinuing OIT. Social factors were the most common reason for discontinuation and were identified in 32 patients (64%). Twenty-four patients (48%) discontinued OIT due to adverse effects. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most prevalent, while anaphylaxis contributed to discontinuation in 15 patients (30%). Anxiety led to discontinuation in 17 patients (34%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlights the importance of social factors and anxiety in the success of OIT completion. Our results support the need to consider not only the patient's medical history, but also their social history and support networks when selecting patients who are good candidates for OIT to optimize the successful completion of OIT."

The effect of OIT on the quality of life in adults, however, has been studied to a much lesser degree. METHODS: Patients with food allergy aged ≥ 18 years who underwent OIT at Shamir Medical Center completed the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Adult Form (FAQLQ-AF) before and at the end of treatment. Adults with FA not undergoing OIT who completed the FAQLQ-AF at 2 time points, served as controls. RESULTS: A total of 44 adults, median age 23.4 years, who underwent OIT for milk (n = 19), egg (n = 2), peanut (n = 9), sesame (n = 6), and tree nuts (n = 8), and 11 controls were studied. The median OIT starting dose was 23.8 mg protein. 33 patients (75%) reached full desensitization within a median of 10.3 months. The FAQLQ-AF baseline scores were comparable between the study and control groups for all items except for Food Allergy related Health (FAH) item in which the study group had a significantly better score (p = 0.02). At the second time point, the study group had significantly better scores in all items (Allergen Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions (AADR), p = 0.02; and Emotional Impact (EI), Risk of Allergen Exposure (RAE), FAH and the Total Score, p < 0.01). The change in scores for the study group was significantly better, statistically and clinically, in AADR, p = 0.04; EI, p < 0.01; RAE, p = 0.01, and in the total score, p = 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: OIT significantly improves quality of life of adults with FA. This finding adds important support for providing OIT in this population."

No current tool covers all foods, forms, and pediatric ages for which OIT is offered. METHODS: In compliance with International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria, this pediatric decision-aid comparing OIT versus avoidance was developed in three stages. Nested qualitative data assessing OIT decisional needs were supplemented with evidence-synthesis from the OIT literature to create the prototype decision-aid content. This underwent iterative development with food allergy experts and patient advocacy stakeholders until unanimous consensus was reached regarding content, bias, readability, and utility in making a choice. Lastly, the tool underwent validated assessment of decisional acceptability, decisional conflict, and decisional self-efficacy. RESULTS: The decision-aid underwent 5 iterations, resulting in a 4-page written aid (Flesch-Kincaid reading level 6.1) explaining therapy choices, risks and benefits, providing self-rating for attribute importance for the options and self-assessment regarding how adequate the information was in decision-making. A total of n = 135 caregivers of food-allergic children assessed the decision-aid, noting good acceptability, high decisional self-efficacy (mean score 85.9/100) and low decisional conflict (mean score 20.9/100). Information content was rated adequate and sufficient, the therapy choices wording balanced, and presented without bias for a \"best choice.\" Lower decisional conflict was associated with caregiver-reported anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: This first pediatric OIT decision-aid, agnostic to product, allergen, and age has good acceptability, limited bias, and is associated with low decisional conflict and high decisional self-efficacy. It supports SDM in navigating the decision to start OIT or continue allergen avoidance.",

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the differences in attitudes toward, familiarity with, and utilization of OIT among non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB), and Hispanic or Latino (H/L) caregivers of children with FA. METHODS: Surveys were administered to the caregivers of children enrolled in Food Allergy Outcomes Related to White and African American Racial Differences, a prospective, multisite cohort of children with FA. The distribution of responses by caregiver-reported race and ethnicity was described using an analysis of variance for continuous outcomes and χ2 tests for categorical outcomes. A logistic regression model was used to determine associations between familiarity with OIT as a treatment option and various other covariates. RESULTS: The NHB and H/L respondents were more frequently not familiar with OIT compared with NHW responders (54.3% and 62.5% vs 9.2%, P < .001). This finding remained true, even after adjusting for household income (odds ratio: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.1-0.4 for NHB participants and odds ratio: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.0-0.3 for H/L participants). NHB and H/L participants more frequently reported that they had never heard of OIT before the survey compared with NHW participants (76.7% and 50.0% vs 26.7%, P < .001). None of the NHB and H/L respondents initiated OIT compared with 14.8% of NHW participants (P < .001). CONCLUSION: In the Food Allergy Outcomes Related to White and African American Racial Differences cohort, familiarity with OIT was lower among caregivers of minoritized racial and ethnic groups, even after adjusting for household income.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sesame allergy, though with low prevalence, can result in severe, potentially life-threatening reactions and poses challenges in allergen avoidance due to hidden sources. In the majority of patients, sesame allergy persists and there is currently no effective long-term treatment available. Therefore, oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a promising alternative approach to managing sesame allergy. In this study protocol, we present a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of OIT with low-dose sesame protein in paediatric patients. The study's aim is to compare OIT with a 300 mg maintenance dose of sesame protein against controls. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 39 participants aged 3-17 with IgE-mediated sesame allergy confirmed by oral food challenge will be enrolled into the study. The trial will be conducted at the Paediatric Hospital of the Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. The study comprises two arms-sesame OIT and control. In the sesame OIT group, interventions will be administered once daily for up to 18 months. During the first phase, the dose will be escalated every 2-4 weeks, and in the second phase, the maintenance dose of 300 mg sesame protein will continue for 3 months. Members of the control group will receive standard treatment, which includes an elimination diet and will remain under observation for 1 year. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants tolerating a single dose of 4000 mg of sesame protein during the final oral food challenge in the experimental group versus the control group. Secondary outcomes assess adverse events, changes in immunological parameters and the maximum tolerated doses of sesame protein in each group. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw (approval number: KB/269/2023). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated via presentations at international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06261554.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined long-term outcomes following oral immunotherapy (OIT); none have examined long-term risks and benefits associated with distinct clinical outcomes (desensitization, remission). METHODS: Participants completing the probiotic and peanut oral immunotherapy (PPOIT) -003 randomized trial were enrolled in a follow-on study, PPOIT-003LT. Peanut ingestion, reactions, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were monitored prospectively. Outcomes at 1-year and 2-years post-treatment were examined by treatment group and by post-OIT clinical outcome (remission, desensitization without remission [DWR], allergic). RESULTS: 86% (151/176) of eligible children enrolled. Post-treatment peanut ingestion at 2-years post-treatment were similar for PPOIT (86.7%) and OIT (78.7%) groups, both higher than placebo (10.3%). Reactions reduced over time for all treatment and clinical outcome groups (PPOIT 31.7% to 23.3%, OIT 37.7% to 19.7%, placebo 13.8% to 6.9%; remission 27.5% to 15.9%; DWR 57.9% to 36.8%; allergic 11.6% to 7%). At 2-years post-treatment, similar proportions of remission and allergic participants reported reactions (RD 0.09 (95%CI -0.03, 0.20), p = .127), whereas more DWR participants reported reactions than remission (remission vs DWR: RD -0.21 (95%CI -0.39; -0.03), p = .02) and allergic (DWR vs allergic: RD 0.30 (95%CI 0.13, 0.47), p = .001) participants. At 2-years post-treatment, 0% remission versus 5.3% DWR versus 2.3% allergic participants reported adrenaline injector usage. Remission participants had significantly greater HRQOL improvement (adjusted for baseline) compared with both DWR (MD -0.54 (95%CI -0.99, -0.10), p = .017) and allergic (MD -0.82 (95%CI -1.25, -0.38), p < .001). CONCLUSION: By 2-years post-treatment, remission participants reported fewer reactions, less severe reactions and greater HRQOL improvement compared with DWR and allergic participants, indicating that remission is the patient-preferred treatment outcome over desensitization or remaining allergic.",

Because the gut microbiome is linked to food allergy, we sought to identify fecal microbial predictors of POIT efficacy and to develop mechanistic insights into treatment response. Longitudinal functional analysis of the fecal microbiome of children (n=79) undergoing POIT in a first double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, identified five microbial-derived bile acids enriched in fecal samples prior to POIT initiation that predicted treatment efficacy (AUC 0.71). Failure to induce disease remission was associated with a distinct fecal microbiome with enhanced capacity for bile acid deconjugation, amino acid metabolism, and increased peanut peptide degradation in vitro . Thus, microbiome mechanisms of POIT failure appear to include depletion of immunomodulatory secondary bile and amino acids and the antigenic peanut peptides necessary to promote peanut allergy desensitization and remission."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) are emerging therapies for food allergy. With several recently published exploratory trials and randomized controlled clinical trials that support these procedures, there is a clear progress and interest toward making these treatment options available for allergist/immunologists and patients with food allergies entrusted to their care. However, there still remain many questions and concerns to be addressed before these procedures can be fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present report is to trace some of the important historical milestones in the development of OIT and EPIT that have contributed to their evolving clinical application to the treatment of food allergy, to describe some of the current understandings of the immunologic mechanisms by which these procedures elicit desensitization, and to provide some areas for future inquiry and research. METHODS: An extensive research was conducted in the medical literature data bases by applying terms such as food allergy, desensitization, tolerance, unresponsiveness, Treg cells, allergen immunotherapy (AIT), oral immunotherapy (OIT), and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT). RESULTS: OIT and EPIT take their origins from AIT (also called desensitization), a procedure first reported for the treatment of hay fever over a 100 years ago in which slowly increasing doses of a specifically relevant allergen were administered until a maintenance dosage was achieved when the patient was free of symptoms. OIT and EPIT differ from AIT in certain aspects including the route of administration of the allergen as well as their relative shorter period of sustained unresponsiveness. CONCLUSION: The origins and important historical landmarks that have been made in the field of food allergy immunotherapy are presented in the context of the immunologic mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years toward making these treatment options available for allergist/immunologists and patients with food allergies, there still remain many questions and concerns to be addressed before these procedures can be fully understood, which can be illuminated by future research."

      "abstract": "Food allergy oral immunotherapy (OIT) has demonstrated efficacy in promoting clinically relevant immunomodulation that leads to desensitization (reduced reactivity while on OIT) in the majority of treated individuals; however, sustained unresponsiveness after OIT cessation for a specified interval has only been observed in a subset. The potential therapeutic benefits of OIT must be balanced with the risk for adverse events. These adverse events may range from self-limited or easily treated oropharyngeal, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms to persistent abdominal symptoms that lead to cessation of therapy and to anaphylaxis. To date, the majority of studies have evaluated single-allergen OIT approaches; however, multi-allergen OIT has demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy outcomes, and is the subject of ongoing investigation. Recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the first licensed OIT product for peanut allergy challenges the long-standing paradigm of dietary food avoidance as the sole option for individuals with food allergy. Yet, the limitations of this \"first-generation\" treatment support the need for continued research and development of next-generation therapies to improve efficacy, minimize risk, and allow for broad applicability to both individuals with single-food allergy and those with multifood allergies. Optimizing future therapies will require developing novel approaches that maximize both efficacy and safety and/or tolerability outcomes, potentially through the combination with biologic therapies or adjuvants. Shared decision-making among patients, physicians, and parents and/or caregivers is critical to select optimal candidates for treatment with OIT by balancing the potential therapeutic benefit and possible risk reduction with a realistic consideration of OIT treatment burden and the risk of treatment-related adverse events."

      "abstract": "Oral immunotherapy (OIT) protocols are not standardized, and a wide heterogeneity exists in the literature. OIT protocol variables include the initiation approach (fixed dose versus oral food challenge), buildup speed (slow versus fast), target maintenance dose (low versus high target dose), type of food used, and use of adjuvants among other variables. Most protocols start with an initial escalation day, which is a series of extremely low doses to safely identify the patients who are most allergic, followed by a buildup period over several months to years until the final target maintenance dose is achieved. Doses are generally increased every 1-2 weeks by a factor of 1.25 to 2 and are adapted based on the patient's symptoms. Protocols are increasingly favoring low-maintenance doses over traditional high maintenance doses, although this needs to be discussed and adapted based on the patient's preferences. Accelerated OIT schedules with using a short treatment of omalizumab can be considered in severe food allergy cases."

      "abstract": "Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an office-based procedure that offers potential treatment of immunoglobulin E mediated food allergy. OIT has multiple benefits, e.g., the ability to desensitize the individual with food allergy, which shifts the eliciting dose threshold required in that individual to trigger an allergic reaction, and also potentially to decrease the severity of any resulting reactions. However, OIT is not a cure and has distinct risks, including the risk of allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) from the therapy itself, the potential risk of developing eosinophilic esophagitis (or similar clinical symptoms without a formal biopsy), and logistical issues in coordinating when to give the daily dose, and there are still uncertain intermediate-to-long-term outcomes with regard to OIT. The decision to start OIT is complex and potentially nuanced. Shared decision-making is a process that allows the patient and family and the clinician to undergo a mutual discussion of the risks, benefits, alternatives, and other considerations with regard to a medical decision (such as starting OIT) whereby there is an exchange of information that allows the patient and family to formally clarify and express their values and preferences with regard to facets of the decision in this particular context. The goal is for the patient to be able to make a fully informed decision that is reflective of his or her goals, values, preferences, and desires. This article outlined some of the key considerations to discuss with parents and patients before enrolling in an OIT program with regard to the risks and benefits, to assist in engaging in shared decision-making and obtaining informed consent."

In young children, cow's milk is one of the most frequent food triggers in anaphylactic episodes, and fatalities have also been described as a result of unintentional exposures, which reinforces the notion that milk allergy can be severe in some individuals. The natural history of CMA is favorable, with the allergy resolving over time in the majority of individuals, although some will have persistent allergy that does not resolve. The standard management approach for CMA consists of strict avoidance of milk and carriage of emergency medication for use in accidental exposures. Recently, a novel approach has emerged as an alternative option for management in patients with CMA in the form of oral immunotherapy (OIT). The aim of milk OIT is to protect patients from accidental exposures to milk-containing foods and allow patients to introduce larger amounts of milk into their diet. The goal of this article was to review the available evidence, discuss key studies that focused on milk OIT, and provide practical information and useful tips related to this novel treatment."

Most of the clinical research about OIT focuses on the products and protocols used for OIT. However, to safely and effectively integrate this into clinical practice, there are many practical aspects that need to be considered. Proper staffing, office space, scheduling, and on-call responsibilities all need to be considered because OIT will impact all of these aspects of practice. We provide suggestions and considerations as you think through these vital logistics in your office. These are practical considerations that must be determined to effectively handle OIT in an office setting. OIT products and protocols are one aspect of OIT.

The same RN may serve as a nurse clinician, patient and family educator, case manager, research collaborator, and OIT program manager. Allergy/immunology practices use diverse staffing models, which thus require adaptation of presented descriptions per clinical team needs and resources."

Those patients with more than one food allergy have the option of sequential courses of single-food OIT or, in the right situation, combining several foods as part of multifood OIT. The time and cost savings can be substantial. Treatment protocols used with multiple foods are basically the same as with single-food courses, so clinics proficient with single-food OIT can easily transition to multifood OIT. Outcomes have been shown to be similar between the two approaches, so patients should be offered the opportunity to address their food allergies in one, more convenient OIT course."

      "abstract": "Egg allergy usually develops in the first year of life, with an estimated prevalence of 2.6%-9%. Rates of resolution and timing vary, with approximately one-third of patients outgrowing their egg allergy by age 6 years. Persistent egg allergy has been associated with high egg white specific immunoglobulin E levels and sensitization to the egg allergen component Gal d 1, which is resistant to heat and digestion. These individuals seem to have a more severe and persistent phenotype of egg allergy. Recently, an active approach has emerged for patients with food allergy, including those with egg allergy, in the form of oral immunotherapy. Egg oral immunotherapy consists of the administration of gradually increasing doses of egg, with the aim to enable patients to consume small amounts of egg without having allergic reactions, which thus provides protection from accidental exposures to egg-containing foods. This article aims to discuss published evidence on egg oral immunotherapy, provide practical information on dosing protocols, and address special challenges associated with this intervention."

However, OIT is not known to lead to a cure, and it carries a risk for allergic reactions. Adjunct therapies to OIT are currently being investigated to evaluate their effect on safety and outcome. Of these therapies, omalizumab is the most evaluated biologic. There is mounting evidence that omalizumab is effective in inducing rapid desensitization of OIT in both single-food and multiallergen OIT, while diminishing the rate of adverse reactions. Evaluation of other adjunct biologics, such as dupilumab and bacterial therapy, is underway."

This is a narrative review of research in which we also provide expert opinion due to the small number of studies addressing the role of dietitians and psychologists in oral immunotherapy to foods. Dietitians support patient education with instructions on how to measure and prepare the immunotherapy dose, incorporate the dose into the daily diet, and transition to equivalent foods to meet dosing needs. Dietitians play an important role in assessing the impact of oral immunotherapy on nutritional health. Psychological distress in food allergy is largely driven by the persistent fear of an adverse reaction, therefore the principal objective of food allergy treatment is to improve patient outcomes, e.g., quality of life. Psychologists must be involved in the design of patient related outcome measures in clinical trials to inform clinical decision-making and health-care policy; an important step in selecting and supporting patients who will benefit most from a particular treatment. Psychologists and dietitians can play a critical role during all phases of oral immunotherapy to foods."

Few reports assessed the benefits and risks of sesame OIT in children with sesame allergy. OBJECTIVE: To study the adverse events and quality of life (QoL) on sesame OIT in a U.S. population. METHODS: Twenty-three patient charts were retrospectively reviewed from 2017 to 2020. The patients received a validated Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire and a survey on adverse reactions during maintenance therapy. Patients who were 8.5 ± 4.7 years of age (30% girls and 70% boys) with a documented history of sesame allergy and who had undergone sesame OIT were reviewed. RESULTS: The buildup phase was 293.7 ± 87.1 days. Twenty-one of the 23 patients (91.3%) reached maintenance therapy. Twenty-one patients (91.3%) had at least one gastrointestinal reaction; 18 (78.3%) had at least one cutaneous reaction; 6 (26%) had at least one respiratory reaction. Age raised the odds of gastrointestinal reactions more than fivefold (odds ratio [OR] 5.653 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.409 - 13.269); p = 0.0009). Asthma boosted the odds of respiratory reactions of more than ninefold (OR 9.206 [95% CI, 1.535 - 55.211]; p = 0.0187). Female gender increased the odds of having a respiratory reaction by more than sevenfold (OR 7.545 [95% CI, 1.207 - 47.153]; p = 0.0330). Asthma amplified the odds of cutaneous reactions (OR 11.725 [95% CI, 2.390 - 57.517]; p = 0.0053). Three patients ultimately discontinued therapy. Food-related anxiety (-0.773) and social/dietary limitation (-0.687) improved significantly in QoL. CONCLUSION: Sesame OIT may be safe and easily adaptable to private practice and significantly improves QoL. Further prospective studies would be helpful to fully assess these relationships."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wheat allergy is one of the most prevalent allergens in Korea, decreasing quality of life and causing nutritional repercussions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the home-based wheat oral immunotherapy (OIT) using wheat noodles in children with a wheat allergy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving 72 children aged 3 to 17 years diagnosed with a wheat allergy. Patients received wheat OIT using wheat noodles (n = 50) and were compared with a historical control group (n = 22). Baseline characteristics, adverse events, and immunological changes were assessed. Predictors of successful desensitization were identified using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 50 patients completing the up-dosing phase, 82.0% achieved desensitization to 2,400 mg of wheat protein, compared to 4.5% in the control group (p < 0.001). During the up-dosing period, the median number of adverse reactions per person was 2, and anaphylaxis occurred in 30.0% (15/50). However, there were no life-threatening adverse events. In multivariable analysis, the presence of asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-71.97; p = 0.041) and a higher ratio of specific IgE (sIgE) to ω-5-gliadin and total IgE (aOR 19.09, 95%CI 1.21-300.80, p = 0.036) were significantly associated with treatment outcomes of wheat OIT. CONCLUSION: Our study showed the safety and efficacy of home-based wheat OIT using boiled noodles in Korean children with wheat allergies. Careful consideration is warranted for patients with elevated baseline sIgE to ω-5-gliadin to total IgE ratio and a history of asthma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The immunometabolic mechanisms underlying variable responses to oral immunotherapy (OIT) in patients with IgE-mediated food allergy are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify novel pathways associated with tolerance in food allergy, we used metabolomic profiling to find pathways important for food allergy in multi-ethnic cohorts and responses to OIT. METHODS: Untargeted plasma metabolomics data were generated from the VDAART healthy infant cohort (N=384), a Costa Rican cohort of children with asthma (N=1040), and a peanut OIT trial (N=20) evaluating sustained unresponsiveness (SU, protection that lasts after therapy) versus transient desensitization (TD, protection that ends immediately afterwards). Generalized linear regression modeling and pathway enrichment analysis identified metabolites associated with food allergy and OIT outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with unaffected children, those with food allergy were more likely to have metabolomic profiles with altered histidines and increased bile acids. Eicosanoids (e.g., arachidonic acid derivatives) (q=2.4×10 -20 ) and linoleic acid derivatives (q=3.8×10 -5 ) pathways decreased over time on OIT. Comparing SU versus TD revealed differing concentrations of bile acids (q=4.1×10 -8 ), eicosanoids (q=7.9×10 -7 ), and histidine pathways (q=0.015). In particular, the bile acid lithocholate (4.97[1.93,16.14], p=0.0027), the eicosanoid leukotriene B4 (3.21[1.38,8.38], p=0.01), and the histidine metabolite urocanic acid (22.13[3.98,194.67], p=0.0015) were higher in SU. CONCLUSIONS: We observed distinct profiles of bile acids, histidines, and eicosanoids that vary among patients with food allergy, over time on OIT and between SU and TD. Participants with SU had higher levels of metabolites such as lithocholate and urocanic acid, which have immunomodulatory roles in key T-cell subsets, suggesting potential mechanisms of tolerance in immunotherapy. KEY MESSAGES: - Compared with unaffected controls, children with food allergy demonstrated higher levels of bile acids and distinct histidine/urocanic acid profiles, suggesting a potential role of these metabolites in food allergy. - In participants receiving oral immunotherapy for food allergy, those who were able to maintain tolerance-even after stopping therapyhad lower overall levels of bile acid and histidine metabolites, with the exception of lithocholic acid and urocanic acid, two metabolites that have roles in T cell differentiation that may increase the likelihood of remission in immunotherapy. CAPSULE SUMMARY: This is the first study of plasma metabolomic profiles of responses to OIT in individuals with IgE-mediated food allergy. Identification of immunomodulatory metabolites in allergic tolerance may help identify mechanisms of tolerance and guide future therapeutic development."

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the long-term adherence rates to OIT protocol and the associated risk of allergic reactions. METHODS: Patients who completed milk OIT and reached a maintenance dose of 200 mL of milk were surveyed biannually on their dairy consumption and occurrence of allergic reactions. A survival analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the risk of reaction and the adherence to OIT maintenance protocol. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 50 patients. Only 56% of the cohort adhered to the protocol, which consisted of ingesting a minimum of 200 mL of milk at least 3 times per week. Adherent patients had a significantly reduced risk of allergic reactions as well as a reduced incidence of anaphylaxis, health care/emergency room visits, and epinephrine/antihistamine administration. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the importance of consistent maintenance dose consumption in the management of food allergies, with regular milk consumption contributing to the maintenance of unresponsiveness and decreased risk of allergic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an increasingly acceptable therapeutic option for peanut-allergic (PA) children, despite significant side effects. Major peanut allergenic proteins are heat-resistant and are not rendered hypoallergenic after baking or cooking. Lyophilized peanut protein-MH (LPP-MH) is a novel composition from developing peanuts, enabling cooking-induced reduction in allergenicity. We aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of OIT, with extensively heated and baked (EHEB) LPP-MH in PA children. METHODS: In a single-arm, single-center, pilot study, PA children with a single highest tolerated dose of <100 mg peanut protein were placed on a 40-week OIT protocol with 300 mg daily of heat-treated LPP-MH. A repeat open peanut food challenge was performed after 40 weeks of treatment and at a 6-12 months of follow-up visit. RESULTS: Thirty-three children with PA were enrolled, with a mean cumulative tolerated dose (MCTD) of 71.2 mg PP (95% CI 45-100 mg). After 40 weeks, 32/33 patients were able to consume more than 300 mg of natural PP, with MCTD of 1709 mg (CI 365-3675 mg). There were no severe allergic reactions requiring epinephrine, during any of the observed LPP-MH challenges or any treatment related doses at home. After 6-12 months on daily maintenance, the MCTD was 8821 mg (95% CI 1930-13,500 mg). This enabled most children age-appropriate dietary inclusion of peanuts. CONCLUSION: An OIT protocol with heat-treated LPP-MH, a novel composition from developing peanuts, seems a potentially safe and efficacious OIT modality for PA children, enabling the introduction of dietary levels of peanut proteins in highly allergic PA children. Validation in randomized controlled studies is mandated.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OIT using enteric-coated capsules for AR induced by house dust mites. METHODS: A total of 49 patients with AR were enrolled, including 25 who received subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and 24 who received OIT. The clinical efficacy and safety in both groups were evaluated. RESULTS: After 1 year of treatment, both SCIT and OIT demonstrated significant therapeutic effects. OIT was found to be more effective than SCIT in reducing the total AR symptom score and improving the results of nasal provocation tests. Local and systemic adverse reactions were observed in the SCIT group, while none were reported in the OIT group. CONCLUSION: OIT is an effective and safe treatment for mite-induced AR."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a promising treatment for food allergy. Prior studies demonstrate significant differences among food-allergic individuals across race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic groups. Disparities in OIT have not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We assessed disparities in the use of OIT in patients with peanut allergy based on race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status at a single academic medical center. METHODS: We identified 1028 peanut-allergic patients younger than 18 years receiving care in the University of Michigan food allergy clinics. Of these, 148 patients who underwent peanut OIT (treatment group) were compared with the 880 patients who avoided peanut (control group). Pertinent demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were compared. RESULTS: There were no differences in gender or ethnicity between the OIT and control groups. However, Black patients comprised 18% of the control group but only 4.1% of the OIT treatment group (P < .0001). The proportion of patients with private insurance was significantly higher in the treatment group compared with the control group (93.2% vs 82.2%, P = .0004). Finally, the neighborhood affluence index, a census-based measure of the relative socioeconomic prosperity of a neighborhood, was significantly higher in the OIT group than the control group (0.51 ± 0.18 vs 0.47 ± 0.19, P = .015), whereas the neighborhood disadvantage index, a census-based measure of the relative socioeconomic disadvantage of a neighborhood, was significantly lower (0.082 ± 0.062 vs 0.10 ± 0.093, P = .020). CONCLUSIONS: Significant racial and economic disparities exist at our institution between peanut-allergic individuals who receive OIT and those who do not. Efforts to understand the basis for these disparities are important to ensure that patients have equitable access to OIT.",

Recent technological advances including single-cell sequencing are transforming the ways in which the transcriptional landscape is understood. The application of these technologies is still in its infancy in food allergy but here we summarize current understanding of gene expression changes following oral immunotherapy for food allergy and specific signatures underpinning the different clinical outcomes of desensitization and remission (sustained unresponsiveness). T helper 2A cells have been identified as a cell type which correlates with disease activity and is modified by treatment. Molecular features at study entry may differentiate individuals who achieve more positive outcomes during OIT. Recent findings point to T cell anergy and Type 1 interferon pathways as potential mechanisms supporting redirection of the allergen-specific immune response away from allergy towards remission. Despite these developments in our understanding of immune mechanisms following OIT, there are still significant gaps. Additional studies examining immune signatures associated with long term and well-defined clinical outcomes are required to gain a more complete understanding of the pathways leading to remission of allergy, in order to optimize treatments and gain improved outcomes for patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a rod-shaped, gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that can be identified by gram staining. Its relationship with cancer is significant since it is involved in approximately 80% of gastric cancers and 5.5% of all malignant cancers. Two lines of treatment have been defined for H. pylori, but almost 40% of patients do not respond to the first line. Recent trials have investigated oral Immunotherapy as a new treatment method. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the potential effects of oral Immunotherapy on eradication rate of H. pylori in human studies. METHODS: The systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. We searched online databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (ISI). Our search strategy was limited to English articles and studies on human populations that use oral immunotherapy for H. pylori. RESULTS: The total number of primary research records in different databases was 2775. After removing duplicate articles (n = 870), we excluded 1829 for reasons including non-human studies, irrelevance to our study objective, non-English language, or lack of information. Of the remaining 76 articles, only seven had sufficient information, and the rest were excluded. The studies were divided into two groups: those that used bovine antibody and those that used immunoglobulin Y to eradicate H. pylori. CONCLUSION: In the group of Immunoglobulin Y, three out of four studies suggest that using Immunoglobulin Y for the treatment of H. pylori infection is significant. However, the group using bovine antibody for the treatment of H. pylori infection has various results, as two out of three studies concluded that bovine antibody therapy is not significant.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergy is a reasonable treatment option, barriers to this procedure's implementation have not been extensively evaluated from a patient perspective. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the barriers patients face during OIT administration, including anxiety and taste aversion, and the role of health care professionals, especially dietitians. METHODS: A survey in Canada and the United States involved families currently enrolled in food OIT programs. RESULTS: Of responses from 379 participants, fear of reaction was the most common barrier to OIT initiation, with 45.6% reporting it being a \"very significant\" barrier with other fears reported. However, taste aversion represented the prominent obstacle to continuation. Taste aversion was associated with a slower buildup (P = .02) and a reduction in dose (P = .002). Taste aversion was a strongly age-dependent barrier for initiation (P < .001) and continuation (P < .002), with older children over 6 years of age reporting it as a very significant barrier (P < .001). Boredom was reported as a concern for specific allergens such as peanut, egg, sesame, and hazelnuts (P < .05), emphasizing the need for diverse food options. Notably, 59.9% of respondents mixed OIT foods with sweet items. Despite these dietary concerns, dietitians were underutilized, with only 9.5% of respondents having seen a dietitian and the majority finding dietitian support helpful with greater certainty about the exact dose (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Taste aversion and anxiety represent primary patient-related barriers to OIT. Taste aversion was highly age dependent, with older patients being more affected. Dietitians and psychology support were underutilized, representing a critical target to improve adherence and OIT success.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Milk and egg allergies significantly impact the quality of life, particularly in children. In this regard, food oral immunotherapy (OIT) has emerged as an effective treatment option; however, the occurrence of frequent adverse reactions poses a challenge, necessitating close monitoring during treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the ability of a new mobile/web app called OITcontrol to monitor milk and egg OIT. METHODS: Patients undergoing milk or egg OIT were recruited and divided into 2 groups: the active group used the OITcontrol app in conjunction with standard written monitoring methods, whereas the control group relied solely on written diaries. Investigators documented hospital doses, hospital reactions, and administered treatments on the website. Patients recorded their daily allergen home-dose intake, home reactions, and administered treatments using the app. The following variables were compared between both groups: number and severity of hospital and reported home reactions, patient's adhesion to the OITcontrol app or written diary or both in terms of daily home-dose intake and home reactions recording, and treatment and dose adjustment compliance at home in case of reaction. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were assigned to be monitored using the OITcontrol app along with additional written methods (active group), while 14 patients relied solely on a written paper diary (control group). A similar distribution was observed in terms of sex, age, basal characteristics, allergen treated in OIT, premedication, and sensitization profile. Active patients reported a comparable number of hospital and home reactions compared with the control group. In terms of recording system usage, 13/16 (81%) active patients used the OITcontrol app, while 10/14 (71%) control patients relied on the written diary. Among active patients, 6/16 (38%) used both methods, and 1 active patient used only written methods. However, control patients recorded home reactions more frequently than active patients (P=.009). Among active patients, the app was the preferred method for recording reactions (59/86, 69%), compared with the written diary (15/86, 17%) or both methods (12/86, 14%; P<.001). Treatment compliance in home-recorded reactions was similar between both groups (P=.15). However, treatment indications after an adverse reaction were more frequently followed (P=.04) in reactions recorded solely in the app (36/59, 61%) than in the written diary (29/71, 41%) or both systems (4/12, 33%). Moreover, compliance with dose adjustments after a moderate-severe reaction in home-recorded reactions was higher in the active group than in the control group (P<.001). Home reactions recorded only in the app (16/19, 84%) were more likely to follow dose adjustments (P<.001) than those recorded in the written diary (3/20, 15%) or using both methods (2/3, 67%). CONCLUSIONS: The OITcontrol app appears to be a valuable tool for monitoring OIT treatment in children with food allergies. It proves to be a suitable method for recording daily home dose intakes and reactions, and it seems to enhance adherence to treatment indications following an adverse reaction as well as compliance with dose adjustments in home reactions. However, additional studies are necessary to comprehensively grasp the benefits and limitations of using the OITcontrol app in the management of OIT."

      "abstract": "Background: Seafood allergy is a significant global health concern that greatly impacts a patient's quality of life. The intervention efficacy of oral immunotherapy (OIT), an emerging intervention strategy, for seafood allergy remains controversial. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of slightly processed allergen/meat from fish and crustacea in OIT, both in mouse models and clinical patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in four mainstream databases and the EBSCOhost database to identify all relevant case-control and cohort studies. The aim was to elucidate the intervention efficacy, encompassing various processing methods and assessing the efficacy of multiple major allergens in OIT. Results: The meta-analysis included five case-control studies on crustacean allergens in mouse models and 11 cohort studies on meat from fish and crustacea in clinical patients for final quantitative assessments. In mouse models, crustacean allergen substantially decreased the anaphylactic score after OIT treatment (mean difference (MD) = -1.30, p < 0.01). Subgroup analyses with low-level heterogeneities provided more reliable results for crab species (MD = -0.63, p < 0.01, I2 = 0), arginine kinase allergen (MD = -0.83, p < 0.01, I2 = 0), and Maillard reaction processing method (MD = -0.65, p < 0.01, I2 = 29%), respectively. In clinical patients, the main meta-analysis showed that the slightly processed meat significantly increased the incidence rate of oral tolerance (OT, incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 2.90, p < 0.01). Subgroup analyses for fish meat (IRR = 2.79, p < 0.01) and a simple cooking treatment (IRR = 2.36, p = 0.01) also demonstrated a substantial increase in the incidence rate of OT. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses successfully identified specific studies contributing to heterogeneity in mouse models and clinical patients, although these studies did not impact the overall significant pooled effects. Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence for the high intervention efficacy of slightly processed allergen/meat from fish and crustacea in OIT, both in mouse models and clinical patients. The Maillard reaction and cooking processing methods may emerge as potentially effective approaches to treating allergen/meat in OIT for clinical patients, offering a promising and specific treatment strategy for seafood allergy. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously, and further supporting evidence is necessary.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to highlight key published oral immunotherapy (OIT) protocols and post-desensitization strategies for the major food allergens and to cover important concepts to consider when evaluating OIT for food-allergic patients. Shared decision-making should help identify patient and family values which will help influence the type of evidence-based protocol and maintenance strategy to use. RECENT FINDINGS: With food OIT emerging as a treatment option, there is a pressing need for patients, physicians, and other providers to have a nuanced understanding of the management choices available to them. There are now randomized controlled trials (RCT) of OIT for peanut, egg, milk, and wheat, and reports of cohorts of patients who have undergone OIT for tree nuts and sesame clinically. The current published protocols contain significant diversity in terms of starting dose, build-up schedule, maintenance dose, and even the product used for desensitization. Emerging data can help direct the long-term maintenance strategy for patients on OIT. Based on patient and family values elicited through the shared decision-making process, an OIT protocol may be selected that balances the level of desensitization, potential side effects, frequency of clinic visits, and potential to induce sustained unresponsiveness, among other factors. Once maintenance dosing is reached, most patients will need to maintain regular exposure to the food allergen to remain desensitized. The option to transition to commercial food products with equivalent amounts of food protein as the OIT maintenance dose would simplify the dosing process and perhaps improve palatability as well. Less frequent or decreased OIT dosing can provide practical benefits but may affect the level of desensitization and safety for some patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of peanut allergy is about 2% and mostly lifelong. Studies of oral immunotherapy (OIT) with peanut (the daily oral intake of an initially low and then increasing dose of peanut) often show problematic side effects, but there are indications of better safety and effect in younger children compared with older children and adults. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and effectiveness of peanut OIT with a slow up-dosing strategy and low maintenance dose in children aged 1 to 3 years who were allergic to peanut, through a 1-year interim analysis. METHOD: In a randomized controlled trial (2:1 ratio), 75 children, median age 31 months (interquartile range [IQR], 23-40 months) were assigned to receive peanut OIT (n = 50) or peanut avoidance (n = 25). RESULTS: In the OIT and avoidance groups, 43 of 50 and 20 of 25 children, respectively, performed the 1-year open oral peanut challenge. A cumulative dose of 750 mg peanut protein after 1 year was tolerated by 72% (36 of 50 children) in the OIT group compared with 4% (1 of 25) in the avoidance group (P < .001). Median tolerated cumulative dose was 2,750 mg (IQR, 275-5,000 mg) peanut protein in the OIT group compared with 2.8 mg (IQR, 0.3-27.8 mg) in the avoidance group (P < .001). Of the doses administered at home during the first year of OIT, 1.4% resulted in adverse events and 79% were mild, and three doses of epinephrine were given at home to two individuals. CONCLUSION: In children aged 1 to 3 years, peanut OIT with the combination of slow up-dosing and low maintenance dose seems safe and effective after 1 year.",

METHODS: Patients aged 4 to 18 years were offered (multi)food SLIT. Patients built up to 2 mg protein SLIT maintenance over the course of 3 to 5 visits under nurse supervision. After 1 to 2 years of daily SLIT maintenance, patients were offered a low-dose oral food challenge (OFC) (cumulative dose, 300 mg protein) with the goal of bypassing OIT buildup. RESULTS: Between summer 2020 and winter 2023, 188 patients were enrolled in SLIT (median age, 11 years). Four patients (2.10%) received epinephrine during buildup and went to the emergency department, but none experienced grade 4 (severe) reaction. A subset of 20 patients had 50 low-dose OFCs to 300 mg protein and 35 (70%) OFCs were successful, thereby bypassing OIT buildup. CONCLUSIONS: In combination with very favorable safety of SLIT, with no life-threatening reactions and few reactions requiring epinephrine, we propose that an initial phase of SLIT to bypass supervised OIT buildup be considered for children in whom OIT is considered to be of higher risk.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral immunotherapy is an effective treatment for food allergies; however, its use in clinical practice is limited by resources and lack of standardized protocols for foods other than peanut. Previous studies have suggested that shrimp has a higher threshold for reaction than other allergenic foods, suggesting it may be safe to directly administer maintenance doses of immunotherapy. METHODS: Children aged 3-17 years who had 1) skin prick test ≥3 mm and/or specific IgE level ≥0.35 kU/L and convincing objective IgE-mediated reaction to shrimp, or 2) no ingestion history and specific IgE level ≥5 kU/L, underwent a low-dose oral food challenge to 300 mg shrimp protein, with the goal of continuing daily ingestion of the 300 mg maintenance dose as oral immunotherapy. RESULTS: Between January 2020 and April 2023, 17 children completed the low-dose oral food challenge. Nine (53%) tolerated this amount with no reaction, and 8 (47%) had a mild reaction (isolated oral pruritis or redness on chin). Sixteen (94%) continued maintenance low-dose oral immunotherapy eating 300 mg shrimp protein daily. None of the patients developed anaphylaxis related to the immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: Our case series suggests that some shrimp allergic patients being considered for oral immunotherapy should be offered a low-dose oral food challenge, to potentially bypass the build-up phase of immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Food allergy affects a large population throughout the world. Recently, oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been reported as an effective treatment for severe food allergy. Although OIT was successful in numerous trials in desensitisation, adverse events including anaphylaxis during OIT frequently occur. Additionally, some patients fail to be desensitised after OIT and the response to treatment is often not sustained. As a further adjunctive therapy to facilitate OIT, the role of biological agents has been identified. For example, efficacy and safety of omalizumab as an adjuvant therapy of OIT has become apparent through some RCTs and observational studies. Interest towards this topic is growing worldwide, and ongoing trials will provide additional data on the biologics in food allergy.We aim to systematically analyse the efficacy and safety of OIT combined with biological agents for food allergy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This paper provides a protocol for a systematic review of the relevant published analytical studies using an aggregate approach following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. Two authors will perform a comprehensive search for studies on MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. Subsequently, two independent authors will perform abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction. A meta-analysis will be conducted as appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol of this systematic review will be provided in a peer-reviewed journal. As the researchers will not identify the individual patients included in the studies, they do not need to acquire ethics approval. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42022373015.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peanut allergy is a common childhood allergy, and the only approved treatment for children 4 to 17 years of age is peanut allergen powder-dnfp (PTAH) oral immunotherapy. METHODS: For this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled peanut-allergic children 1 to <4 years of age who experienced dose-limiting symptoms from ≤300 mg peanut protein during a screening double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Participants received PTAH or placebo, randomized in a 2:1 ratio, for approximately 12 months. At the trial conclusion, all participants underwent an exit BDPCFC. The primary end point was desensitization (i.e., tolerating a ≥600-mg single dose of peanut protein with only mild allergy symptoms). RESULTS: In the PTAH-treated group (n=98), 73.5% of participants tolerated a single dose of ≥600 mg peanut protein at exit DBPCFC compared with 6.3% in the placebo group (n=48). Most participants experienced an adverse event (98.0% of PTAH-treated and 97.9% of placebo-treated participants), which was mild or moderate in grade for 93.2% of participants (92.9% in PTAH-treated and 93.8% in placebo-treated participants). Treatment-related adverse events, which were mild to moderate, were experienced by 75.5% of PTAH-treated and 58.3% of placebo-treated participants. Three treatment-related systemic allergic reactions, none of which were severe or serious in grade, were noted in two PTAH-treated participants (2%). CONCLUSIONS: In peanut-allergic children 1 to <4 years of age treated with PTAH for approximately 12 months, the majority tolerated all peanut protein dose levels assessed. PTAH-treated patients had more treatment-related adverse events, which were mild to moderate severity. (Funded by Aimmune Therapeutics; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03736447.)",

Allergen-specific immunotherapy is known for modifying both IgE and IgG4. Peanut oral immunotherapy may influence these serological parameters. METHODS: Exploratory analyses of serological data from participants receiving peanut (Arachis hypogaea) allergen powder-dnfp (PTAH) and placebo in the double-blind, randomized, phase 3 PALISADE trial were conducted to evaluate potential relationships between peanut-specific and peanut component-specific (Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, Ara h 6, Ara h 8, and Ara h 9) IgE and IgG4 levels and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 269 participants (PTAH, n = 202; placebo, n = 67) were analyzed. No relationship was observed between specific IgE and IgG4 levels at screening and maximum tolerated peanut protein dose during screening or response status during exit double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). In PTAH-treated participants, no relationship was observed between IgE and IgG4 levels at screening and maximum symptom severity during exit DBPCFC. Postscreening ratios (ie, postscreening/screening) in the PTAH group were significant at the end of updosing and exit visit for most components. Postscreening changes in specific IgE levels were more pronounced with PTAH versus placebo for most components. CONCLUSIONS: Specific IgE and IgG4 levels at screening are not correlated with screening or exit DBPCFC results, and are not predictive of clinical response to PTAH. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) allergen powder-dnfp contains the relevant and immunodominant allergens, inducing immunological changes with the treatment.

      "abstract": "Food allergy has been increasing in prevalence in most westernised countries and poses a significant burden to patients and families; dietary and social limitations as well as psychosocial and economic burden affect daily activities, resulting in decreased quality of life. Food oral immunotherapy (food-OIT) has emerged as an active form of treatment, with multiple benefits such as increasing the threshold of reactivity to the allergenic food, decreasing reaction severity on accidental exposures, expanding dietary choices, reducing anxiety and generally improving quality of life. Risks associated with food immunotherapy mostly consist of allergic reactions during therapy. While the therapy is generally considered both safe and effective, patients and families must be informed of the aforementioned risks, understand them, and be willing to accept and hedge these risks as being worthwhile and outweighed by the anticipated benefits through a process of shared decision-making. Food-OIT is a good example of a preference-sensitive care paradigm, given candidates for this therapy must consider multiple trade-offs for what is considered an optional therapy for food allergy compared with avoidance. Additionally, clinicians who discuss OIT should remain increasingly aware of the growing impact of social media on medical decision-making and be prepared to counter misconceptions by providing clear evidence-based information during in-person encounters, on their website, and through printed information that families can take home and review.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen egg-allergic children received egg powder with short up--dosing and they maintained tolerance using egg in daily diet. Seventeen egg-allergic children served as a control group. Component-resolved analysis of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), IgA1, IgA2, and IgG4 levels were determined at inclusion, after up-dosing and after 1 year of immunotherapy. Skin-prick tests were performed at inclusion and after 1 year of therapy. RESULTS: All 18 patients in the egg OIT group were successfully desensitized. Desensitization was achieved on average in 4.5 months. In the control group, only two children tolerated egg in oral food challenge after 1 year. Of the measured immune markers, smaller wheal diameters in skin-prick testing, reduction in component-specific IgE levels, and increase in component-specific IgA1, IgA2, and IgG4 levels were associated with desensitization. CONCLUSION: A lightened egg OIT is effective and safe in children with egg allergy. Increase in all egg component-specific IgA1, IgA2 and IgG4 levels and decrease in all egg component--specific IgE levels were observed after 12 months of OIT.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess factors associated with difficulties in wheat OIT. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from children under 18 years of age with history of IgE-mediated wheat allergy who underwent wheat OIT. The initial specific IgE (sIgE) of wheat and omega-5-gliadin, wheat skin prick test (SPT) sizes, eliciting doses, and adverse reactions during the OIT were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 81 children were enrolled, with a mean age of 7.0 ± 2.7 years at the initiation of wheat OIT. The median follow-up duration was 2 years (IQR 1.2 -3.0 years). Difficulties in wheat OIT included patients who experienced frequent reactions (at least grade 2 or exercise-induced reactions) or deviated from the up-dosing protocol, which we defined as 'Complicated cases.' Twenty-six patients (32.1%) were complicated cases. Initial wheat-sIgEs were significantly higher in complicated cases than in noncomplicated cases (median of 192.3 kUA/L (IQR 30.4-590.0) vs 6.9 kUA/L (IQR 1.9-100.0) (p = 0.001)). Initial omega-5-gliadin-sIgEs in the complicated group were also significantly higher, with a median of 15.0 kUA/L (IQR 6.3-69.8) vs 1.6 kUA/L (IQR 0.2-11.4) (p < 0.001). The risk factors for complicated cases include higher omega-5-gliadin-sIgEs and anaphylaxis during the oral food challenge test (aOR 1.035 and 5.684, respectively). CONCLUSION: The initial wheat and omega-5-gliadin-sIgEs were significant risk factors for complicated OIT patients and could be used to monitor these patients carefully during the OIT period."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Probiotic Peanut Oral Immunotherapy-003 multicenter randomized trial found that both probiotic peanut oral immunotherapy (PPOIT) and peanut OIT alone (OIT) were effective compared with placebo in inducing clinical remission after 18 months of treatment, and improving health-related quality of life (HRQL) at 12 months after treatment. Understanding treatment effect modifiers can optimize outcomes through precision care. OBJECTIVES: This post hoc study examined baseline clinical and demographic participant factors that modified treatment effects. METHODS: The study sample included 201 children (aged 1-10 years) with challenge-confirmed peanut allergy. Exposure variables were baseline clinical and demographic factors. Outcomes were remission (double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge, cumulative 4,950-mg peanut protein at 8 weeks after treatment) and HRQL (change in Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Parent Form score). Interactions between baseline factors and treatment effects on remission and HRQL were explored with regression models. RESULTS: A higher degree of peanut sensitivity (large peanut skin prick test, high peanut specific IgE, and low reaction-eliciting dose at study entry challenge) and other concurrent allergic conditions (multiple food allergies, asthma, or wheeze) were associated with the decreased likelihood of attaining remission after both PPOIT and OIT treatment. History of anaphylaxis was associated with the reduced likelihood of remission after PPOIT compared with OIT. For the HRQL outcome, there was evidence that sex, history of anaphylaxis, and age modified treatment effects. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline participant factors modify PPOIT and OIT effects on remission and HRQL. Considering modifiers of treatment effect during participant selection may optimize treatment success and clinical trial design toward specific outcomes, such as the achievement of remission.",

OBJECTIVE: Here we assessed shifts in IgE and IgG4 binding to peanut allergens and their epitopes recognized by United States (US) peanut allergic participants (n = 20) enrolled in phase 3 PTAH OIT clinical trials. METHODS: Pre- and post- trial participant sera were collected approximately 12 months apart and tested for IgE binding to intact peanut proteins via ImmunoCAP ISAC immunoassays. IgE and IgG4 linear epitopes were identified based on binding to synthetic overlapping 15-mer linear peptides of 10 peanut allergens (Ara h 1-11) synthesized on microarray slides. RESULTS: Statistically significant decreases in IgE binding were identified for intact Ara h 2, 3, and 6, and known and newly identified IgE epitopes were shown to exhibit shifts towards IgG4 binding post-OIT, with most linear peptides having increased IgG4 binding after treatment with PTAH. While PTAH does not seem to alter the actual peptide binding patterns significantly after one year of treatment, the IgE and IgG4 binding ratios and intensity are altered. CONCLUSION: At a population level, the linear IgE and IgG4 epitopes of 10 peanut allergens overlap and that increase in IgG4 with OIT results in displacement of IgE binding to both conformational and linear epitopes. Furthermore, it appears as though the increase in IgG4 is more important to achieve desensitization at the 12-month timepoint than the decrease in IgE. This type of knowledge can be useful in the identification of IgE and IgG4-binding allergen and peptide biomarkers that may indicate desensitization or sustained unresponsiveness of allergic individuals to peanut."

Effectiveness outcomes included rate of sustained unresponsiveness (SU) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The cost-effectiveness of PPOIT versus placebo was analysed using patient-level data. Time horizon was 10 years from commencement of PPOIT treatment, comprising 1.5 years of treatment (actual data), 4 years of post-treatment follow-up (actual data), and 4.5 years of extrapolation thereafter (modelling). RESULTS: Healthcare cost per patient over 10 years was higher for PPOIT compared with placebo ($A9355 vs $A1031, p<0.001). Over half of the per patient healthcare cost (53%) in the PPOIT group was attributable to treatment delivery, while the remaining cost was attributable to adverse events. Both measures of effectiveness were superior in the PPOIT group: the average SU rate over 10 years was 54% for PPOIT versus 6% for placebo (p<0.001); QALYs over 10 years were 9.05 for PPOIT versus 8.63 for placebo (p<0.001). Overall, cost per year of SU achieved was $A1694 (range $A1678, $A1709) for PPOIT compared with placebo, and cost per additional QALY gained was $A19 386 (range $A19 024, $A19 774). CONCLUSIONS: Cost per QALY gained using PPOIT compared with no treatment is approximately $A20 000 (£10 000) and is well below the conventional value judgement threshold of $A50 000 (£25 000) per QALY gained, thus deemed good value for money ($A1= £0.5 approximately).

      "abstract": "The worldwide rising prevalence of food allergy is a major public health concern. Standard care consists of allergen avoidance and rescue medication upon accidental exposure. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is increasingly being studied as a treatment option. Although desensitization (an increased reaction threshold) is often achieved during OIT, sustained unresponsiveness (SU; clinical nonreactivity after finishing OIT) is not achieved in most patients. A few studies have investigated the effectiveness of OIT in children younger than 4 years of age (early = e-OIT) and have shown a much more favorable outcome in terms of SU development. Together with food allergy prevention studies, which have demonstrated high efficacy of early oral allergen exposure, the outcomes of e-OIT studies indicate an early-life window of opportunity to achieve SU, allowing unrestricted dietary intake. However, the underlying mechanism of the high effectiveness of e-OIT is not understood yet. Both cohort and OIT studies indicate early-life immune plasticity. An immature food-allergic response in the first years of life seems to be a major driver of this immune plasticity, along with a higher tolerogenic immunological state. Allergy maturation can likely be disrupted effectively by early intervention, preventing the development of persistent food allergy. Upcoming studies will provide important additional data on the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of e-OIT. Combined with immune mechanistic studies, this should inform the implementation of e-OIT.",

      "abstract": "Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has gained popularity recently for IgE-mediated food allergy. Omalizumab (OMZ) has been used in patients (10-20%) who have too severe/frequent allergic reactions (AR) to continue OIT, to reduce these reactions. In this study, it was aimed to compare two groups of patients who completed OIT with and without OMZ and to seek determinants predicting the need of this treatment. It was also aimed to share the clinical findings regarding the long-term use of OMZ and the withdrawal process. Forty-one patients were started OIT and 93% could be desensitized. Two groups were similar in means of demographic characteristics, and clinical and laboratory findings. The patients who needed OMZ during OIT had also lower reaction doses during oral challenge (p = 0.037). Higher AR rate in this group declined after starting OMZ (p < 0.001). The injection intervals of OMZ were gradually extended. Most patients were able to discontinue OMZ (81%). There were no severe reactions during drug withdrawal attempts. The low reaction thresholds during oral food challenge may give a clue about OMZ requirement during OIT. It may be an option to start the treatment before OIT if reaction was seen in the first few steps of the oral food challenge. For the sake of safety, extension of injection intervals should be preferred instead of abruptly stopping OMZ.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Food allergy is a major public health challenge in Australia. Despite widespread uptake of infant feeding and allergy prevention guidelines the incidence of peanut allergy in infants has not fallen, and prevalence of peanut allergy in school-aged children continues to rise. Therefore, effective and accessible treatments for peanut allergy are required. There is high-quality evidence for efficacy of oral immunotherapy in children aged 4-17 years old; however, few randomised trials have investigated peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) in young children. Furthermore, the use of food products for OIT with doses prepared and administered by parents without requiring pharmacy compounding has the potential to reduce costs associated with the OIT product. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Early Peanut Immunotherapy in Children is an open-label randomised controlled trial of peanut OIT compared with standard care (avoidance) to induce desensitisation in children aged 1-4 years old with peanut allergy. n=50 participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention (daily peanut OIT for 12 months) or control (peanut avoidance). The primary outcome is the proportion of children in each group with a peanut eliciting dose >600 mg peanut protein as assessed by open peanut challenge after 12 months, analysed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes include safety as assessed by frequency and severity of treatment-related adverse events, quality of life measured using age-appropriate food allergy-specific questionnaires and immunological changes during OIT. ETHICS: The trial is approved by the Child and Adolescent Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee and prospectively registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. DISSEMINATION: Trial outcomes will be published in a peer-review journal and presented and local and national scientific meetings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12621001001886.",

However, tahini is often not palatable to children, and high-maintenance doses may not be possible for preschoolers. OBJECTIVE: We studied the safety and effectiveness outcomes of preschoolers with sesame allergy who underwent low-dose S-OIT of 200 mg protein. METHODS: Preschoolers with sesame allergy, with a history of objective reaction to sesame, and with either a positive skin prick test result (wheal diameter ≥3 mm) or sesame-specific IgE level ≥0.35 kU/L were included. Doses were escalated every 2 to 4 weeks until the maintenance dose of 200 mg of sesame protein was reached. The maintenance dose was continued daily for 1 year, followed by exit oral food challenge (OFC). Primary safety outcomes included allergic reactions grade 2 or higher and the need for epinephrine therapy during buildup. The primary effectiveness outcome was proportion of patients tolerating a minimum of 2000 mg sesame protein at exit OFC. RESULTS: Twenty-eight preschoolers (median age, 33.5 months) were enrolled to receive S-OIT. During the buildup phase, 9 subjects (32.1%) had no reaction, and 8 (28.6%) and 11 (39.3%) had grade 1 and 2 reactions, respectively. One patient (3.57%) received epinephrine for a grade 2 reaction. Twenty-one (91.3%) of 23 eligible subjects underwent exit OFC; 18 (85.7%) of these 21 patients successfully completed exit OFC. One (4.8%) and 2 (9.5%) subjects had grade 1 and 2 reactions, respectively, during OFC. CONCLUSIONS: A lower and age-appropriate maintenance dose is safe and effective in desensitizing preschoolers with sesame allergy."

      "abstract": "The increasing food allergy incidence has led to significant interest in developing therapies for allergic diseases. Oral allergen-specific immunotherapy (OIT) is a recently FDA-approved therapeutic to treat peanut allergies. OIT utilizes daily allergen dosing to reduce allergic reactions to peanuts. However, there is diminished enthusiasm for daily OIT, potentially due to the strict regimen required to induce desensitization and the risks of severe adverse events. Thus, there remains a need for safe and effective food allergy treatments that are well-received by allergic individuals. Preclinical research studies investigate methods to induce allergen desensitization in animals and support clinical studies that address the limitations of current food allergy OIT. Because allergic reactions are triggered by allergen doses above an individual's activation threshold, immunotherapy regimens that induce allergen desensitization with lower allergen doses or without the requirement of daily administrations may expand the use of food allergy immunotherapy. Administering allergen immunotherapy by alternative routes is a strategy to induce desensitization using lower allergen doses than OIT. Several animal models have evaluated oral, sublingual, epicutaneous, and intranasal immunotherapy routes to treat food allergies. Each immunotherapy route may require different allergen doses, formulations, and treatment schedules to induce desensitization. This article will discuss scientific findings from food allergy immunotherapy animal studies that utilize various immunotherapy routes to induce allergen desensitization to support future clinical studies that enhance the safety and efficacy of allergen immunotherapy to treat food allergies."

      "abstract": "Peanut allergy is a growing health concern that can cause mild to severe anaphylaxis as well as reduced quality of life in patients and their families. Oral immunotherapy is an important therapeutic intervention that aims to reshape the immune system toward a higher threshold dose reactivity and sustained unresponsiveness in some patients. From an immunological point of view, young patients, especially those under 3 years old, seem to have the best chance for therapy success. To date, surrogate markers for therapy duration and response are evasive. We provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature state regarding immune signatures evolving over the course of oral immunotherapy as well as baseline immune conditions prior to the initiation of treatment. Although research comparing clinical and immune traits in the first years of life vs. later stages across different age groups is limited, promising insights are available on immunological endotypes among peanut-allergic patients. The available data call for continued research to fill in gaps in knowledge, possibly in an integrated manner, to design novel precision health approaches for advanced therapeutic interventions in peanut allergy."

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe additional long-term pooled safety data and changes in peanut sensitization markers from baseline through approximately 5 years of treatment. METHODS: The results from 6 clinical trials of PTAH (3 controlled and 3 open-label extension studies [N = 1227]) were pooled, and analysis of safety outcomes and immunologic data was performed. The PTAH doses were administered sequentially as follows: initial dose escalation (dose increased to 6 mg over 2 days), updosing (dose increased every 2 weeks to 300 mg for a minimum of 6 months), and maintenance dosing (300 mg per day). RESULTS: There was a trend toward decreased adverse events (AEs) at years 1 and 2 that was maintained up to 5 years, with 94% of patients experiencing mild or moderate AEs and only 13% discontinuing PTAH use because of AEs overall. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most commonly reported treatment-related AEs. A downward trend in systemic allergic reactions was also reported. PTAH treatment resulted in reduced levels of peanut-specific IgE after the first year and increased levels of peanut-specific IgG4, with a lowered peanut-specific IgE:IgG4 ratio. A reduction in median peanut skin prick test wheal diameter was observed (11.50 mm at baseline vs 5.75 mm at year 5). CONCLUSION: Long-term immunomodulation without any new safety signals was reported with PTAH immunotherapy in the largest safety data set and longest treatment duration for oral immunotherapy published to date."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) may induce eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are an effective treatment for EoE. However, the effect of PPI treatment is not well established in patients with EoE induced by OIT. Our primary aim was to compare the clinical, endoscopic, and histological response rates to PPIs in children with EoE induced by OIT (EoE+OIT) versus EoE patients without OIT (EoE-OIT). The secondary aims are to describe the clinical and histological features of EoE+OIT. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and histological findings of patients with EoE in the gastroenterology clinic at Shamir Medical Center between March 2015 and December 2022 were collected. Comparisons were performed between EoE+OIT and EoE-OIT patients. The study included 42 children (74% male, mean age 11.2), of whom 31 had EoE-OIT and 11 had EoE+OIT. There were no significant differences between groups regarding sex, comorbidities, symptoms, or endoscopic and histological characteristics at diagnosis. All 42 children were treated with PPIs after diagnosis with or without diet changes. The rates of any clinical response were 83.9% and 90.1% in the EoE-OIT group and EoE+OIT group, respectively (p = 1.0). The rate of any endoscopic response was 74.2% for EoE-OIT and 81.8% for EoE+OIT (p = 0.54). Histologically, PPIs were even more effective in the EoE+OIT group, where only 18.2% had no histological response at all compared to 51.6% in the EoE-OIT group (p = 0.1). CONCLUSION: PPI treatment is as effective in EoE with OIT as it is in EoE due to other etiologies. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is effective for achieving clinical response and histologic remission in some patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). • EoE has also been reported to be triggered by oral immunotherapy (OIT). WHAT IS NEW: • PPI treatment in EoE with OIT is as effective as treatment for EoE due to other etiologies.",

However, the optimal therapeutic period for obtaining SU remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to retrospectively investigate the association between the OIT treatment period and achievement of SU. METHODS: We enrolled patients who received OIT for peanut allergy between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022. OIT comprised the build-up phase, maintenance phase, complete avoidance, and an oral food challenge (OFC) for confirming SU. The peanut dose in the OFC was gradually increased to 3,000 mg (peanut protein: 795 mg), which was subsequently maintained for ≥5 months. SU was defined as a negative response to 795 mg of peanut protein after ≥2 weeks of complete avoidance. We evaluated the therapeutic OIT period for achieving SU using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients underwent peanut OIT. The starting age at OIT initiation was 8 (interquartile range [IQR], 7-10) years. Forty-one (85%) patients had a history of anaphylaxis. The median specific immunoglobulin E concentration to peanut and Ara h 2 at OIT initiation was 85.3 (IQR, 33.7-100) and 57.6 (IQR, 21.9-100) UA/mL, respectively. The median observational period was 2.1 (IQR, 1.6-3.0) person-years (PY). Thirty-four (71%) patients achieved SU, with the rate of SU achievement gradually increasing with the therapeutic period. The median period until SU achievement was 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.6-2.5) PY. The rate of SU achievement slowed down after 2.7 PY. CONCLUSION: OIT for at least 2.7 PY can increase the rate of SU achievement. The protocol No. 3107."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) imposes a burden on parents and their children with food allergies (FAs). We already developed a questionnaire for OIT-related Parental Burden (OIT-PB) scale. However, the previous questionnaire had some problems. This study modified OIT-PB and verified its reliability and validity. METHODS: A 20-item draft covering the physical and mental burdens caused by OIT was prepared jointly with multiple allergists. The Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Parental Burden (FAQLQ-PB) and Stress Response Scale-18 (SRS-18) were used to verify concurrent validity. A questionnaire survey was administered during treatment to parents of FA children who had started OIT for the first time. An additional OIT-PB survey was performed at one specific institution 1 week after the posttreatment survey. RESULTS: The responses of 64 of the 76 recruited parents were analyzed. Of the 20 questions, 1 item was excluded owing to the floor effect, 1 was excluded because its commonality was less than 0.2, and 2 were excluded because their factor loading values were less than 0.4. Factor analysis was used to classify the OIT-PB into the following 4 subscales: \"burden caused by adherence to treatment plan,\" \"anxiety about symptom-induced risk,\" \"burden due to patient's eating behavior,\" and \"anxiety about treatment effect.\" The Cronbach's α for all 16 items of the OIT-PB was 0.893; Cronbach's α for each subscale was 0.876, 0.898, 0.874, and 0.717. The re-test reliability coefficient was 0.864 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.720-0.937, p &lt; 0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between the OIT-PB and FAQLQ-PB (R = 0.610 [95% CI: 0.422-0.747], p &lt; 0.001) and the SRS-18 (R = 0.522 [95% CI: 0.306-0.687], p &lt; 0.001). A significant negative correlation was found between the rate of increase in OIT food intake and the \"anxiety about treatment effect\" score (R = -0.355 [95% CI: -0.558-0.112], p &lt; 0.001). Parents of children on the hen's egg OIT treatment scored higher on the \"burden due to patient's eating behavior\" subscale than did parents of children on the milk and wheat OIT treatment. CONCLUSION: The burden of OIT experienced by parents can be broadly classified into four categories. The modified OIT-PB was able to evaluate them individually and was shown to have reliability and validity. This scale is expected to be useful in the development of OIT that considers not only therapeutic effect but also the burden experienced by FA children and their parents.",

      "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic inflammatory disease requiring maintenance therapy. Traditionally, EoE has been a contraindication to oral immunotherapy (OIT) and a rationale for discontinuing treatment because OIT may induce EoE. Most, but not all patients with OIT-induced EoE experience symptom resolution and histologic remission after discontinuing OIT. Recent studies report OIT continuation even after EoE onset, despite the previously accepted standard of care. This creates clinical as well as ethical challenges for allergists treating these patients. Considering the published literature on EoE and OIT and the primary medical ethics principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice, we discuss the ethical implications of pursuing desensitization despite the potential complications associated with EoE. When ethical principles are in opposition, shared decision-making should be employed to determine whether OIT should be continued after an EoE diagnosis. This article highlights the ethical dilemmas allergists face when determining whether patients with a diagnosis of EoE should continue OIT.",

Our aim was to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of a novel red meat (RM) OIT in galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) allergy in adults. METHODS: Out of 20 patients with confirmed RM allergy, five (41.66%) underwent an early OIT, seven (58.33%) underwent a delayed protocol and eight patients who were not desensitized formed the patient control group. 15 and 27 day RM OIT for early-onset and delayed-onset alpha-gal allergy were administered, respectively. Desensitized patients were recommended to continue eating at least 100 g RM every day for 6 months and every other day in the following 6 months. After a year, the consumption was recommended 2/3 times in a week. Patients were followed up with skin tests with commercial beef and lamb extracts, fresh raw/cooked beef and lamb and cetuximab and also with serum alpha-gal specific Immunoglobulin-E (sIgE) in the first and fifth years. RESULTS: All patients who underwent OIT became tolerant to RM. During the 5 year follow-up, the median alpha-gal sIgE concentration gradually decreased in nine patients who consumed RM uneventfully while remained unchanged in the control group (p = .016). In two patients, rare tick bites acted as inducers of hypersensitivity reactions with concomitant elevation of alpha-gal sIgE concentrations whereas one patient with low follow-up alpha-gal sIgE concentrations consumed RM uneventfully after frequent tick bites. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the long-term safety and efficacy of alpha-gal OIT. Additionally, alpha-gal sIgE seems to be a potential biomarker to monitor OIT.",

We synthesized evidence from the best randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on efficacy/safety of OIT for desensitization (DS) and remission (sustained unresponsiveness (SU)) in IgE mediated allergy to peanut, hen's eggs, and cow's milk. BODY: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (Until Oct 22) identifying 16 eligible RCTs published in English measuring food allergy by food challenge at the beginning and at the end of the study. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess study quality. We found 18 eligible studies. There was evidence of efficacy for DS for all allergens: peanut (RR 11.32; 95% CI 5.93, 21.60, I2 49%, 8 studies); hen's egg (RR 4.67; 2.66, 8.21, I2 0%, 5 studies); cow's milk (RR 13.98; 3.51, 55.65, I2 0%, 4 studies) and evidence for SU for peanut (RR 7.74; 2.90, 20.69, I2 0%, 3 studies) and hen's egg (RR 6.91; 1.67, 28.57, I2 0%, 2 studies). Allergic events were increased with intervention, and risk of adrenaline use increased for peanut RR 2.96; 1.63, 5.35, I2 0%, 8 studies; egg RR 1.71; 0.42, 6.92, I2 0%, 6 studies; and milk RR 8.45; 2.02, 35.27, I2 0%, 4 studies. CONCLUSION: We found strong evidence that peanut, hen's egg, and cow's milk OIT can induce DS and some evidence for remission. There was a high risk of allergic reactions. Generalizability to the entire food allergic population is not known."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: While oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been shown to promote the remission of mild peanut allergy in young children, there is still an unmet need for a disease-modifying intervention for older patients and those with severe diseases. In mice models, abatacept, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) immunoglobulin fusion protein, has been shown to promote immune tolerance to food when used as an adjuvant to allergen immunotherapy. The goal of this study is to explore the potential efficacy of abatacept in promoting immune tolerance to food allergens during OIT in humans. METHODS: In this phase 2a proof-of-concept study (NCT04872218), 14 peanut-allergic participants aged from 14 to 55 years will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to abatacept vs. placebo for the first 24 weeks of a peanut OIT treatment (target maintenance dose of 300 mg peanut protein). The primary outcome will be the suppression of the OIT-induced surge in peanut-specific IgE/total IgE at 24 weeks, relative to the baseline. Sustained unresponsiveness will be assessed as a secondary outcome starting at 36 weeks by observing incremental periods of peanut avoidance followed by oral food challenges. DISCUSSION: This is the first study assessing the use of abatacept as an adjuvant to allergen immunotherapy in humans. As observed in preclinical studies, the ability of abatacept to modulate the peanut-specific immune response during OIT will serve as a proxy outcome for the development of clinical tolerance, given the small sample size. The study will also test a new patient-oriented approach to sustained tolerance testing in randomized controlled trials."

OIT should be monitored by pediatric allergists specializing in OIT and oral food challenge tests to manage allergic reactions. Although a previous history of anaphylaxis or multiple food allergies is not a contraindication to OIT, it is contraindicated if the patient has uncontrolled asthma, a malignancy, active systemic autoimmune disorders, or diseases requiring treatment with beta-blockers. A variety of OIT protocols have been de veloped to ensure better outcomes and safe up-dosing, including adjunctive therapies with biologics. This review provides insight into the practical issues of various immunotherapy options for children with HE or CM allergies."

Although research in this area has been ongoing for many years, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved product for peanut allergy treatment became available only in January 2020. Limited data exist on OIT services offered by physicians in the United States. OBJECTIVE: This workgroup report was developed to evaluate OIT practices among allergists practicing in the United States. METHODS: The authors developed an anonymous 15-question survey and was subsequently reviewed and approved by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Practices, Diagnostics and Therapeutics Committee before distribution to the membership. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology electronically distributed the survey to a random sample of 780 members in November 2021. In addition to questions specific to food OIT, the survey included questions on demographics and professional characteristics of the responders. RESULTS: A total of 78 members completed the survey, yielding a 10% response rate. Fifty percent of responders were offering OIT in their practice. There was a significant difference in experience in OIT originating from research trials in academic versus nonacademic centers. Generally, OIT practices were similar in both settings for the number of foods offered, the performance of oral food challenges before initiating treatment, the number of new patients to whom OIT was offered to per month, and age groups OIT to whom was offered. Almost all of the reported barriers to OIT were similar between settings: staff and time limitations, concerns about safety and anaphylaxis, the need for more education on how to perform, inadequate compensation, and that it was not a significant demand from patients. Clinic space limitations were significantly different and more prominent in academic settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey revealed interesting trends in the practice of OIT across the United States, with some significant differences arising when academic and nonacademic settings were compared.",

Here, we review existing data on the clinical and immunological outcomes of pOIT that inform best practices for pOIT candidate selection. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we describe the natural history of peanut allergy, summarize immunological and clinical outcomes of pOIT at different ages, discuss the optimization of pOIT in key age groups, and finally suggest an ideal age range at which to initiate pOIT for best outcomes. EXPERT OPINION: pOIT is currently underutilized by patients and allergist-immunologists. Developing guidelines for selecting appropriate patients and optimizing treatment may help to increase access to pOIT. Many aspects of pOIT need additional study to further our understanding of the optimal timing to start pOIT, with careful consideration to clinical, immunological, and quality of life outcomes.",

However, the safe use of retail foods depends on the ability to establish the specific allergen protein content of these foods. OBJECTIVE: To develop a systematic approach to estimate the protein content of peanut, milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut, and walnut in a variety of retail food equivalents for each allergen and associated patient education materials. METHOD: We created an algorithm that used a multistep process with information from product food labels, nutrient databases, independent weighing and measuring of foods, and information provided by manufacturers, including certificates of analysis, and e-mail communication to estimate the allergen protein content of multiple retail foods for each of seven allergens. Once a variety of retail food equivalents for each allergen and allergen serving size was determined, we developed participant education handouts, which were reviewed by study teams at 10 food allergy centers, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Consortium for Food Allergy Research coordinating center. After 1 year of use, multiple queries were addressed and the retail food equivalents and educational materials were reviewed and edited. RESULTS: We identified a variety of retail food equivalents for seven allergens at six serving sizes, and created 48 unique patient education materials. CONCLUSION: Our results provide extensive guidance on a variety of retail equivalents for seven foods, and a method to estimate retail food protein equivalents systematically with ongoing reassessment.",

Although oral immunotherapy (OIT) is effective at inducing desensitization to food allergens, it has several limitations that weaken its success. Limitations include a long duration of build-up, especially when used for multiple allergens, and a high rate of reported adverse events. Furthermore, OIT may not be effective in all patients. Efforts are underway to identify additional treatment options, either as monotherapy or in combination, to treat FA or enhance the safety and efficacy of OIT. Biologics such as omalizumab and dupilumab, which already have US Food and Drug Administration approval for other atopic conditions have been the most studied, but additional biologics and novel strategies are emerging. In this review, we discuss therapeutic strategies including immunoglobulin E inhibitors, immunoglobulin E disruptors, interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 inhibitors, antialarmins, JAK1 and BTK inhibitors, and nanoparticles, and the data surrounding their application in FA and highlighting their potential.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of enhanced, butanol purified Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2 (E-B-FAHF-2) for inducing remission in subjects undergoing omalizumab-facilitated multiallergen OIT (multi-OIT). METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either E-B-FAHF-2 or placebo, starting 2 months before OIT and continuing throughout OIT. All subjects received a 4-month course of omalizumab, starting 2 months before OIT through the 2-month OIT build-up phase. After 24 months of multi-OIT (maintenance dose of 1000 mg of each allergen), desensitization and remission were assessed. The primary objective was to determine if subjects in the E-B-FAHF-2 group (EOIT) were more likely than the placebo group (OIT) to develop remission to all 3 allergens treated with multi-OIT, as defined by the absence of dose-limiting symptoms to a cumulative dose of 4444 mg of protein after discontinuing treatment for 3 months. RESULTS: Thirty-three subjects were randomized. A total of 63.6% were desensitized to 4444 mg of protein for each allergen at 26 months, and 24.2% met the primary outcome of remission at 29 months, with no difference between the treatment groups. There was good adherence (>85%) with study medications, with no difference between the treatment groups. There was no difference in reported overall adverse events between the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Omalizumab-facilitated multifood OIT was safe and effective, and remission was achieved in about a quarter of subjects. However, outcomes were not improved by the addition of E-B-FAHF-2.",

      "abstract": "Food allergy (FA) has become more prevalent and problematic in the last 2 decades, and it poses important individual, social, and economic burdens. Besides treating reactions induced by accidental exposure and periodic evaluation for acquiring natural tolerance, the primary management approach is still allergen avoidance as a global standard. However, an active therapeutic approach that can raise the reaction threshold or accelerate tolerance is needed. This review aimed to provide an overview and the latest evidence of oral immunotherapy (OIT), which has recently been used in the active treatment of FA. FA immunotherapy, particularly OIT, is gaining considerable interest, and substantial effort has been made to integrate this active treatment into clinical practice. Consequently, growing evidence has been obtained regarding the efficacy and safety of OIT, particularly for allergens such as peanuts, eggs, and milk. However, several issues need to be addressed regarding the availability, safety, and long-term effects of this intervention. In this review, we summarize currently available information regarding tolerance-inducing immune mechanisms of OIT, data on efficacy and safety, gaps in current evidence, and ongoing research to develop new therapeutic molecules in order to enhance safety."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Food allergy remains a common problem and a lifelong condition for many children. In recent years, food allergy management has increasingly involved conversations about food oral immunotherapy (OIT). Although ethical considerations of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice implicitly inform these conversations, applying these principles can be complex, particularly in young children. Families of young children assume a role of surrogate decision-maker and must balance immediate risks with the hope of longer-term benefits. OBJECTIVE: To explore implementation of OIT in children through an ethical lens. METHODS: To evaluate OIT through an ethical lens, we conducted a literature search to explore currently published frameworks in this area. RESULTS: Evaluation of the harm principle, the basic interest principle, and the best interest principle of parental decision-making can be informative. Shared decision-making continues to be central to the process of engaging with patient-family units to individualize the best care, at the right time, and minimize decisional discord. Although OIT is well-positioned to promote health and well-being, challenges to equity, sustainability, and organizational support must be considered to improve access for appropriate patients. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas approaches to food OIT may be tailored to the individual context of each patient-family unit, ethical principles must guide decisions to initiate and continue therapy. Traditional ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice remain cornerstones when considering the ethical context of OIT.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Peanut allergy and its current management, involving peanut avoidance and use of rescue medication during instances of accidental exposure, are burdensome to patients and their caregivers and can be a source of stress, uncertainty, and restriction. Physicians may also be frustrated with a lack of effective and safe treatments other than avoidance in the current management of peanut allergy. Efficacy, determined using double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs), of oral immunotherapy with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) allergen powder-dnfp (PTAH; Palforzia®) was demonstrated versus placebo in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years in multiple phase 3 trials; continued benefit of PTAH was shown in a follow-on trial. The DBPCFC is a reproducible, rigorous, and clinically meaningful assessment accepted by regulatory authorities to evaluate the level of tolerance as an endpoint for accidental exposures to peanut in real life. It also provides useful clinical and patient-relevant information, including the amount of peanut protein an individual with peanut allergy can consume without experiencing dose-limiting symptoms, severity of symptoms, and organs affected upon ingestion of peanut protein. We explored symptoms of peanut exposure during DBPCFCs from phase 3 and follow-on trials of PTAH to further characterize treatment efficacy from a perspective relevant to patients, caregivers, and clinicians. METHODS: Symptom data recorded during screening and/or exit DBPCFCs from participants aged 4 to 17 years receiving PTAH or placebo were examined post hoc across three PTAH trials (PALISADE [ARC003], ARC004 [PALISADE follow-on], and ARTEMIS [ARC010]). The maximum peanut protein administered as a single dose during DBPCFCs was 1000 mg (PALISADE and ARTEMIS) and 2000 mg (ARC004). Symptoms were classified by system organ class (SOC) and maximum severity. Endpoints were changes in symptom severity and freedom from symptoms (ie, asymptomatic) during DBPCFC. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for symptom severity by SOC and freedom from symptoms between groups; descriptive statistics were used to summarize all other data. RESULTS: The risk of any respiratory (RR 0.42 [0.30-0.60], P < 0.0001), gastrointestinal (RR 0.34 [0.26-0.44], P < 0.0001), cardiovascular/neurological (RR 0.17 [0.08-0.39], P < 0.001), or dermatological (RR 0.33 [0.22-0.50], P < 0.0001) symptoms was significantly lower in participants treated with PTAH versus placebo upon exposure to peanut at the end of the PALISADE trial (ie, exit DBPCFC). Compared with placebo-treated participants (23.4%), the majority (76.3%) of PTAH-treated participants had no symptoms at the exit DBPCFC when tested at the peanut protein dose not tolerated (ie, reactive dose) during the screening DBPCFC. Significantly higher proportions of PTAH-treated participants were asymptomatic at doses ≤ 100 mg in the exit DBPCFC compared with placebo-treated participants (PALISADE: 69.35% vs 12.10%, RR 5.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.55-9.26]; P < 0.0001; ARTEMIS: 67.42% vs 13.95%, RR 4.83 [95% CI 2.28-10.25]; P < 0.0001); findings were similar at peanut protein doses ≤ 1000 mg (PALISADE: RR 15.56 [95% CI 5.05-47.94]; P < 0.0001; ARTEMIS: RR 34.74 [95% CI 2.19-551.03]; P < 0.0001). In ARC004, as the period of PTAH maintenance became longer, greater proportions of participants were asymptomatic at doses of peanut protein ≤ 1000 mg in the exit DBPCFC (from 37.63% after ~ 6 months of maintenance treatment [exit DBPCFC of PALISADE] to 45.54% after ~ 13 months and 58.06% after ~ 20 months of overall PTAH maintenance treatment). CONCLUSIONS: PTAH significantly reduced symptom severity due to exposure to peanut, which is clinically relevant. When exposed to peanut, participants with peanut allergy treated with PTAH rarely had moderate or severe respiratory or cardiovascular/neurological symptoms. Oral immunotherapy with PTAH appears to reduce frequency and severity of allergic reactions in individuals with peanut allergy after accidental exposure to peanut and may enable them and their families to have an improved quality of life.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: SLIT for the treatment of plant food allergies has been demonstrated to be safe but less effective than OIT, but the latter is associated with more adverse reactions. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new protocol starting with SLIT-peach followed by OIT with commercial peach juice in patients with LTP syndrome. METHODS: This was a prospective, noncontrolled, open study on patients with LTP syndrome who are not sensitized to storage proteins. SLIT peach ALK was followed by OIT with Granini® peach juice after 40 days of the SLIT maintenance phase. At home, the Granini® juice dose was progressively increased during the 42 days until reaching 200 ml. After achieving the maximum dose, an open oral food challenge was carried out with the food that had caused the most severe reaction. If negative, the patient was instructed to progressively introduce the foods that were avoided before starting immunotherapy at home. Patients were reviewed 1 month later. The quality-of-life questionnaire FAQLQ-AF was completed at the beginning of the study and one month after the final challenge. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included, most of them with LTP anaphylaxis. Peach SLIT was well tolerated in 80.5%, and OIT with Granini® was well tolerated in 85%, with no severe adverse reactions. The final provocation was successful in 39/45 (86.6%). One month after the final provocation, 42/45 (93.3%) patients had no dietary restrictions. FAQLA-AF was significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This combination of peach SLIT and OIT with commercial peach juice provides a new, fast, effective, and safe immunotherapy option for selected patients with LTP syndrome who are not allergic to storage proteins, improving their quality of life. This study suggests that cross-desensitization relative to the nsLTPs of several plant foods can be achieved by using Prup3."

      "abstract": "Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is now recognized as an alternative active treatment to strict food avoidance in certain patients with IgE-mediated food allergy. Studies have confirmed the efficacy of OIT to desensitize children with allergy to cow's milk, eggs, and peanuts. The benefits, risks, and constraints of OIT are becoming increasingly well understood. However, there is no consensual criteria to select patients to whom OIT could be proposed, and many issues remain to address including the definitions of desensitization and long-term efficacy, the assessment of patient's experience in real life, the optimization of buildup and maintenance protocols, and the utility of multiple food OIT. The recent authorization by medical agency concerning the first medicine for peanut OIT is a step forward towards higher standardization in the practice of OIT. This article summarizes in comprehensive narrative format data on efficacy, tolerance, impact on quality of life and adverse effects of OIT and discuss elements to consider in clinical practice before starting OIT."
