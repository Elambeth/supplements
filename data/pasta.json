      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Legume seeds, such as chickpeas, are a rich source of resistant starch (RS) and have a low glycemic index (GI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cooking and cooling chickpea pasta on the RS content, glycemic response, and GI in healthy subjects. Methods: Twelve healthy subjects of both sexes, aged 18-65 years, participated in this study. Each person consumed two standardized portions of chickpea pasta: (i) freshly cooked (FCP) and (ii) cooked chickpea pasta which was cooled for 24 h at 4 °C and reheated before consumption (CCP). Glucose solution was provided as a reference food. Participants consumed chickpea pasta in a random order. GI measurements were completed using the standard methodology and calculated according to the ISO 2010 standard. Results: The cooling and reheating process significantly increased the RS content of boiled chickpea pasta (from 1.83 g/100 g to 3.65 g/100 g) and had a beneficial effect on postprandial glycemia in healthy individuals. The CCP pasta had a significantly lower GI value than the FCP pasta (33 vs. 39, p = 0.0022). A significant difference in the glucose, as identified by the incremental area under the curve (IAUC), was observed between the CCP and FCP (1327.9 ± 414.8 mg/dL/min vs. 1556.1 ± 456.9 mg/dL/min, p = 0.0022). The cooling-reheating process did not affect the sensory attributes of the chickpea pasta. In general, the overall acceptability of the CCP pasta was similar to that of the FCP pasta. Conclusions: The results of our study support the hypothesis that a reduced glycemic response after simple changes in technological intervention leads to a decrease in postprandial blood glucose and GI. This can be helpful for people who need to control postprandial glycemia."

The \"mini-incision\" transtendon double-pulley suture bridge presented in the study is a pragmatic technique in treatment of PASTA lesion. The 4 suture strands on the medial-row anchor provide enough biomechanical strength on the reattached articular layer, the \"mini-incision\" minimizes iatrogenic trauma on the bursal layer, and double-pulley suture-bridge smoothly covers the \"mini-incision\" so as to achieve anatomical reduction of articular and bursa side of supraspinatus tendon. The surgical technique is described, as well as pearls, pitfalls, advantages, and disadvantages."

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that produces inflammation in the gut mucosa, affecting nutrient digestion and absorption. CD affects 0.3% to 1.0% of the world's population and only 15% have a clinical diagnosis. The only effective treatment is a gluten-free diet. The objective of this study was to develop a dough for gluten-free pasta prepared with mixtures of flours from corn, amaranth, soy, and rice. According to the FAO standard of 1975, the resultant mixtures should have a protein content greater than 11.0% and a chemical rating of not less than 70. Three mixtures were obtained: corn‒soy (81-19), corn‒rice‒soy (48-37-15), and corn‒rice‒amaranth (49-32-14). To improve the handling of the pasta and its physical characteristics (sedimentation, degree of absorption, and cracked shaped pasta) compared to a control (commercial) gluten-free pasta, carboxymethylcellulose, an emulsifier (distilled monoglycerides), and egg albumin were added at concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, and 5.0%, respectively. The corn flour was pregelatinized, and the extrusion was repeated twice. The experimental pasta had a protein content of 14.0%, which was higher than the commercial pasta (4.5%), and a gluten content of less than 20 mg/kg which, according to the Codex Alimentarius International Food Standard (2015), it is considered gluten-free. The corn‒rice‒soy pasta obtained had an acceptance and liking similar to a commercial brand. This pasta may widen the gluten-free products commercially available to CD patients in Mexico, which nowadays is limited and expensive. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Raw materials available in our country were selected to promote their consumption and diversify the ingredients used in the production of gluten-free products. The pasta obtained presented a higher nutritional content than a commercial gluten-free pasta and was comparable to that of a pasta made with wheat.",

However, the relationship between BNP levels and stroke severity in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unelucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between stroke severity at admission and BNP levels. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we used data from 513 patients with AF and acute ischemic stroke treated with oral anticoagulants (OAC) registered in the Multicenter Prospective Analysis of Stroke Patients Taking Oral Anticoagulants study. The patients were divided into two groups: high-BNP (≥200 pg/mL) and low-BNP level (<200 pg/mL) groups. We compared the clinical characteristics between the two groups and determined the effect of BNP levels on stroke severity on admission. RESULTS: Among the 513 enrolled patients, 248 (females, n = 30; median age, 82 years) and 265 (females, n = 76; median age, 71 years) were assigned to the high- and low-BNP level groups, respectively. The high-BNP level group had a higher proportion of patients with severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ≥10) on admission (49.2% vs. 32.8%, p = 0.002) and major vessel occlusion (57.5% vs. 39.2%, p < 0.0001) than that had by the low-BNP level group. Multivariate analysis showed that high BNP level was independently associated with severe stroke on admission (odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.15; p = 0.0478). CONCLUSIONS: High BNP level compared with low BNP level was associated with severe stroke and major vessel occlusion, even before OAC treatment.",

We investigated the association between pre-stroke CHADS2 score and outcome at discharge in patients with acute cardioembolic (CE) stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF) who were prescribed OAC. METHODS: The data of 548 OAC-treated patients with AF and CE stroke who were registered in the multicenter Prospective Analysis of Stroke patients Taking oral Anticoagulants (PASTA) study were analyzed. High CHADS2 score was defined as a pre-stroke CHADS2 score ≥2. Unfavorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 3-6. The impacts of pre-stroke CHADS2 score on outcome at discharge were evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULT: A high CHADS2 score was found in 472/548 patients and unfavorable outcome was found in 330/548 patients. In patients with unfavorable outcome, age, male sex, pre-stroke CHADS2 score, initial National Institute Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and glucose level on admission were significantly higher, whereas creatinine clearance and body weight were significantly lower, than those with favorable outcome (each p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that high CHADS2 score (OR 2.18, 95 %CI 1.08-4.42, p = 0.031), pre-stroke mRS (OR 2.21, 95 %CI 1.69-2.67, p < 0.001), and initial NIHSS score (OR 1.19, 95 %CI 1.17-1.24, p < 0.001) were independently associated with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: Pre-stroke CHADS2 score was associated with poor outcome in patients with cardioembolic stroke due to AF, even in those taking OAC.",

The latter observations are not quantified and provide only the information that they are below a laboratory-specific threshold value. Besides deterministic approaches, which simplify the treatment through the substitution of non-detected values with fixed threshold or null values, a growing interest has been shown in the application of stochastic approaches to the treatment of unquantified values. In this study, a multiple imputation procedure was applied in order to analyze contamination data on deoxynivalenol, a mycotoxin that may be present in pasta and pasta substitute products. An application of the proposed technique to censored deoxynivalenol occurrence data is presented. The results were compared to those attained using deterministic techniques (substitution methods). In this context, the stochastic approach seemed to provide a more accurate, unbiased and realistic solution to the problem of left-censored occurrence data. The complete sample of values could then be used to estimate the exposure of the general population to deoxynivalenol based on consumption data.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the rate and timing of oral anticoagulant (OAC) resumption and its safety in patients after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in current clinical practice in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a sub-analysis of the PASTA registry, an observational, multicenter registry of 1043 patients with stroke receiving OACs in Japan, by including patients with ICH on OAC treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The clinical characteristics of the patients in the resumption and non-resumption groups, rate and timing of OAC resumption, its safety, and switching of OACs after ICH were investigated. RESULTS: Of the 160 patients (women, n = 52; median age, 77 years) included, OACs were resumed in 108 (68%) at a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 4-11) after acute ICH onset. The non-resumption group had higher rates of hematoma expansion (21.2% vs. 7.4%; P = 0.0118) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at discharge (4 (Suda et al., 2019; Steiner et al., 2014 [3, 4]) vs. 4 (Suda et al., 2019; Steiner et al., 2014; Pasquini et al., 2014 [3-5]); P = 0.0302}. The resumption rate in the mRS 0-4 group was higher than that in the mRS 5 group (75.2% vs. 46.5%; P = 0.00006). The number of days to resumption after ICH onset was longer in the mRS 5 than that in the mRS 0-4 group (median 12 days vs. 7 days, P = 0.0065). There were no significant differences in new-onset ICH, symptomatic hematoma expansion, or gastrointestinal bleeding between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early resumption of OAC for NVAF in patients after ICH appeared to be safe. Expected functional outcomes at discharge were associated with OAC resumption and with the timing of resumption.

      "abstract": "Wheat is one of the main crops that is cultivated and consumed in the world. Since durum wheat is less abundant and more expensive than other types, pasta producers can use common wheat by applying various techniques to achieve the desired quality. A heat moisture treatment was applied to common wheat flour, and the effects on dough rheology and texture, and pasta cooking quality, color, texture, and resistant starch content were evaluated. The results revealed that heat moisture treatment temperature and moisture content induced a proportional increase in visco-elastic moduli, dough firmness, pasta cooking solids loss, and luminosity, as they were higher compared to the control. The breaking force of uncooked pasta decreased when the flour moisture content increased, while the opposite trend was observed for resistant starch content. The highest resistant starch values were obtained for the samples treated at the lowest temperature (60 °C). Significant correlations (p < 0.05) were obtained between some of the textural and physical characteristics analyzed. The studied samples can be grouped in three clusters characterized by different properties. Heat moisture treatment is a convenient physical modification of starch and flours that can be employed in the pasta industry. These results underline the opportunity to enhance common pasta processing and final product functionality by using a green and non-toxic technique to develop new functional products."

Three brands of commercial pasta were submitted to different cooking times (7, 10 and 13 min). Subsequently, the in vitro bioaccessibility trials, permeation across the intestinal membrane and estimation of daily exposure were carried out. The lowest cooking time (7 min) resulted in high reductions of TCTB (88%) and AA + HMF (76.7%) contents found on the raw pasta. The concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON) and AA were higher after the digestion (bioaccessibilities >100%) than after the pasta cooking. About 25.6% of DON and 100% of AA found in the small intestine digestible fraction were able to permeate the intestinal membrane. The risk of exposure was below the recommended safe limits since the estimated daily exposure values were 0.22 µg/kg per body weight/day for DON and 0.26 µg/kg per body weight/day for AA. Therefore, cooking pasta for 7 min at a pasta:water ratio of 1:10 (w/v) mitigates the contaminants and promotes the greater formation of resistant starch.",

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the safety of recanalization therapy in patients receiving DOACs. METHODS: We assessed data from a prospective multicenter registry of patients with stroke, including those with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with rtPA and/or MT who were administered DOACs. We evaluated the safety of recanalization considering the DOACs dosage and interval between the last DOAC intake and recanalization. RESULTS: The final analysis included 108 patients (women, n = 54; median age, 81 years; DOAC overdose, n = 7; appropriate dose, n = 74; and inappropriate low dose, n = 27). The rate of any ICH differed significantly among overdose-, appropriate dose-, and inappropriate-low dose DOACs groups (71.4, 23.0, and 33.3%, respectively; P = 0.0121), whereas no significant difference was observed in respect of symptomatic ICH (P = 0.6895). Multivariate analysis showed that the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.11; P = 0.0267) and overdose-DOAC (OR: 8.40, 95% CI: 1.24-56.88; P = 0.0291) were independently associated with any ICH. No relationship was observed between the timing of the last DOAC intake and occurrence of ICH in patients treated with rtPA and/or MT (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Recanalization therapy during DOAC treatment may be safe in selected patients with AIS, if it is performed >4 h after the last DOAC intake and the patient is not overdosed with DOACs.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prior concomitant use of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and antiplatelet (AP) therapy increase the hematoma volume and mortality compared with VKA monotherapy in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). However, the prior concomitant use of non-vitamin K oral antagonists (NOACs) and AP has not been clarified. METHODS: We conducted a PASTA registry study, which was an observational, multicenter, registry of 1043 patients with stroke receiving oral anticoagulants (OACs) in Japan. In the present study, ICH from the PASTA registry was used to analyze the clinical characteristics including mortality among the four groups (NOAC, VKA, NOAC and AP, and VKA and AP) using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Among the 216 patients with ICH, 118 (54.6%), 27 (12.5%), 55 (25.5%), 16 (7.4%) were taking NOAC monotherapy, NOAC and AP, VKA, and VKA and AP, respectively. In-hospital mortality rates were the highest in VKA and AP (31.3%) than in NOACs (11.9%), NOACs and AP (7.4%), and VKA (7.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the concomitant use of VKA and AP (odds ratio [OR], 20.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-241.75, p = 0.0162), initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR, 1.21; 95%CI, 1.10-1.37, p < 0.0001), hematoma volume (OR, 1.41; 95%CI, 1.10-1.90, p = 0.066), and systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.31; 95%CI, 1.00-1.75, p = 0.0422) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although VKA in addition to AP therapy could increase the in-hospital mortality, NOAC and AP did not increase the hematoma volume, stroke severity, or mortality compared to NOAC monotherapy.",

In this work, fifteen different commercial gluten-free pasta samples made from cereals, pseudocereals, and pulses, alone or in mixed combinations, were analyzed to assess their nutritional value, essential amino acids composition, and protein chemical score. The occurrence of the Maillard reaction was investigated, and the levels of heat treatment markers (furosine, maltulose, hydroxymethylfurfural, and glucosylisomaltol) were determined. Analysis of the furosine values showed that pasta made with the same raw materials can have different degrees of thermal damage. There was no evidence of the Maillard reaction progressing in the advanced phase in any of the samples tested. Finally, the correlation between maltulose and furosine levels demonstrated the usefulness of combining the two markers to assess the extent of thermal damage."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Complex intra-articular calcaneal fractures often resulted in secondary pain and deformity, requiring subsequent subtalar arthrodesis1-3. The literature suggests that primary subtalar arthrodesis in the acute period has good functional results2,3. The literature also demonstrates that posterior arthroscopic subtalar arthrodesis for chronic arthritis has favorable results5. Thus, we propose an approach to treating these difficult intra-articular calcaneal fractures that utilizes a posterior arthroscopic primary subtalar arthrodesis technique-aptly named Calcaneus Fracture and Posterior Arthroscopic Primary Subtalar Arthrodesis (C-PASTA). DESCRIPTION: The procedure begins with the patient in the prone position. The subtalar joint is visualized with a 1.9-mm flexible camera through a standard posterior arthroscopic approach. With the help of the C-arm, position in the subtalar joint space is confirmed. The joint space is debrided with use of a 4-0 shaver and then prepared for arthrodesis arthroscopically with use of an osteotome and a burr. Next, we inject allograft demineralized matrix-based bone putty under direct arthroscopic visualization to fill residual gaps or defects. The arthrodesis is performed under fluoroscopic guidance with use of 2 guidewires followed by 2 to 3 titanium compression screws. The first screw is inserted along the posteromedial calcaneus and into the talar dome medially. The second is placed laterally into the head-neck junction of the talus. The third screw is placed distal to proximal from the plantar anterior process to the talar head. Finally, images are obtained in multiple views to ensure proper screw placement, and the screws are tightened sequentially to ensure equal compression across the joint. ALTERNATIVES: Nonoperative treatment of calcaneal fractures includes cast immobilization with non-weight-bearing, although this treatment is typically reserved for nondisplaced, small extra-articular fractures6. Operative treatment of calcaneal fractures includes open reduction and internal fixation, which is traditionally performed via a sinus tarsi approach or extensile lateral approach. Primary subtalar arthrodesis has been utilized primarily for Sanders type-IV fractures6. RATIONALE: Displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures are associated with alarmingly high rates of posttraumatic arthritis (30% to 70% within 1 year of injury), and surgical outcomes are inversely proportional to the severity of the fracture pattern, with Sanders III and IV having the worst outcomes1. Treating these most severe fracture patterns with primary open subtalar arthrodesis has shown favorable results in terms of union rates, pain scores, and functional outcomes throughout the literature2,3. However, some authors have reported rates of revision as high as 60%4. Thus, the PASTA procedure has been established, resulting in significantly better time to union, return to work, activities of daily living, and sports activities compared with open techniques5. Thus, given the favorable results of primary open subtalar arthrodesis and the proven results with use of an arthroscopic technique in the non-acute setting, we propose that C-PASTA can serve as an alternative treatment option in the acute setting for patients with Sanders type-III and IV calcaneal fractures. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect the outcomes of this procedure to mirror those found throughout the literature, which shows favorable results for open primary subtalar arthrodesis1-3. With use of an arthroscopic approach, we expect better time to union, return to work, activities of daily living, and sports activities than if the procedure were performed in an open fashion5. In addition, minimizing soft-tissue damage through an arthroscopic approach may decrease the risk of infection and stimulate postoperative healing, perhaps accounting for the more favorable postoperative recovery period compared with an open procedure. IMPORTANT TIPS: In the arthroscopic approach to the subtalar joint, identify the flexor hallucis longus, making sure to stay lateral to that tendon to remain in the \"safe zone.\"Utilizing the TRIMANO device (Arthrex) to distract the ankle longitudinally in addition to a solid bump placed on the anterior aspect of the ankle allows for optimal subtalar joint visualization.Fish-scaling with an osteotome followed by bone grafting allows for a good fill between cancellous fragments to stimulate an optimal environment for fusion.Divergent screws should be placed and tightened sequentially to ensure equal compression across the joint.

      "abstract": "Iodized table salt provides iodide that is essential for health. However, during cooking, we found that chloramine residuals in tap water can react with iodide in table salt and organic matter in pasta to form iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs). While naturally occurring iodide in source waters is known to react with chloramine and dissolved organic carbon (e.g., humic acid) during the treatment of drinking water, this is the first study to investigate I-DBP formation from cooking real food with iodized table salt and chloraminated tap water. Matrix effects from the pasta posed an analytical challenge, necessitating the development of a new method for sensitive and reproducible measurements. The optimized method utilized sample cleanup with Captiva EMR-Lipid sorbent, extraction with ethyl acetate, standard addition calibration, and analysis using gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. Using this method, seven I-DBPs, including six iodo-trihalomethanes (I-THMs) and iodoacetonitrile, were detected when iodized table salt was used to cook pasta, while no I-DBPs were formed with Kosher or Himalayan salts. Total I-THM levels of 11.1 ng/g in pasta combined with cooking water were measured, with triiodomethane and chlorodiiodomethane dominant, at 6.7 and 1.3 ng/g, respectively. Calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of I-THMs for the pasta with cooking water were 126- and 18-fold, respectively, compared to the corresponding chloraminated tap water. However, when the cooked pasta was separated (strained) from the pasta water, chlorodiiodomethane was the dominant I-THM, and lower levels of total I-THMs (retaining 30% of the I-THMs) and calculated toxicity were observed. This study highlights an overlooked source of exposure to toxic I-DBPs. At the same time, the formation of I-DBPs can be avoided by boiling the pasta without a lid and adding iodized salt after cooking.",

However, many alternative gluten-free foods available on the market present nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, the aim of this research was to evaluate the composition and the antioxidant properties of gluten-free pasta enriched with 10% or 15% of tomato waste or linseed meal, two food industry by-products. The traits analysed were protein, lipid, ash and fibre content, heat damage, tocols, carotenoids and phenolics composition (by HPLC), antioxidant capacity, and pasta fracturability. The enriched pastas contained more fibre and lipids than the control, while the protein and ash values were similar. The addition of tomato and linseed waste improved tocols concentration but had no effect on carotenoids content. The free soluble polyphenols increase was similar for both by-products and proportional to the enrichment percentage, while the bound insoluble polyphenols were higher in linseed-enriched pastas. The samples with linseed meal showed the greatest antioxidant capacity and, at 10% addition, the highest fracturability value. In conclusion, the addition of tomato and linseed by-products significantly increases the presence of bioactive compounds (particularly polyphenols), improving the nutritional value of gluten-free pasta.",

Pasta from raw red lentils (R) was prepared by conventional extrusion (C_R) and extrusion-cooking (EC_R), whereas heat-treated red lentils (HT) were processed into pasta by conventional extrusion (C_HT). A \"high protein\" and \"high fiber\" pasta was prepared. Using HT was effective in increasing the luminosity (that was about 88, 91, and 96 for EC_R, C_R, and C_HT, respectively), and decreasing the presence of defects on the pasta surface (heterogeneity was 5%, 36%, and 45% for C_HT, EC_R, and C_R, respectively). Heat treatment on grains or flour significantly increased starch susceptibility to α-amylase (6.6, 7.4, and 8.6% for C_R, C_HT, and EC_R, respectively) and decreased the final viscosity (from 335 BU in C_R to 287 and 291 BU in EC_R and C_HT), resulting in a significant increase in starch digestibility (slowly digestible starch was about 41, 27, and 26% in C_R, C_HT, and EC_R, respectively). As regards proteins, the main effect on their structure was observed in C_HT, where the cooking behavior was much improved and cooking losses were lowest (5.7%). On the other hand, protein and starch organization in EC_R might have accounted for pasta resistance in overcooking."

During the production process of mozzarella cheese, as well as of other pasta-filata cheeses made with pasteurized or raw milk, curd is heated and stretched by addition of hot or boiling water. This step is the critical point for the inactivation of MAP during the production process, but, to our knowledge, no studies have been published about the thermal death time values of MAP in curd. The aim of this study was to determine the inactivation kinetics of MAP in curd used to produce pasta-filata cheese in six independent experiments. The milk was inoculated with a mix of MAP strains (field and registered strains) and, with the aim to simulate the thermal treatment of the curd during the stretching step, samples of 10 g of contaminated curd were vacuum packed and treated separately at six different temperatures from 60°C to 75°C in a water bath. MAP survival was then evaluated by plate count method and inactivation parameters were estimated for determining the thermal resistance of the pathogen directly in the curd. D-values increased from 0.15 min (D75-value) to 4.22 min (D60-value) and the calculated z-value was 10.2°C. These data aid: (i) to design food thermal process treatments defining acceptance limits of critical control points to ensure safety against MAP; (ii) to predict the time/temperature combinations needed to obtain a certain MAP log reduction during the curd stretching step; (iii) to optimize or validate pasta-filata cheese process."

This study aimed at improving the microbial quality, safety, and shelf life of fresh pasta using modified atmosphere composition and packaging with or without the addition of bioprotective cultures (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium spp., and Bacillus coagulans) into semolina. Three fresh pasta variants were made using (i) the traditional protocol (control), MAP (20:80 CO2:N2), and barrier packaging, (ii) the experimental MAP (40:60 CO2:N2) and barrier packaging, and (iii) the experimental MAP, barrier packaging, and bioprotective cultures. Their effects on physicochemical properties (i.e., content on macro elements, water activity, headspace O2, CO2 concentrations, and mycotoxins), microbiological patterns, protein, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) were investigated at the beginning and the end of the actual or extended shelf-life through traditional and multi-omics approaches. We showed that the gas composition and properties of the packaging material tested in the experimental MAP system, with or without bioprotective cultures, positively affect features of fresh pasta avoiding changes in their main chemical properties, allowing for a storage longer than 120 days under refrigerated conditions. These results support that, although bioprotective cultures were not all able to grow in tested conditions, they can control the spoilage and the associated food-borne microbiota in fresh pasta during storage by their antimicrobials and/or fermentation products synergically. The VOC profiling, based on gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS), highlighted significant differences affected by the different manufacturing and packaging of samples. Therefore, the use of the proposed MAP system and the addition of bioprotective cultures can be considered an industrial helpful strategy to reduce the quality loss during refrigerated storage and to increase the shelf life of fresh pasta for additional 30 days by allowing the economic and environmental benefits spurring innovation in existing production models."

However, there is a lack of understanding about temporal profile of digestion of wheat proteins from different food matrices under physiologically relevant conditions. In this study, digestion of three wheat-based foods (bread, pasta and cereal) was conducted based on the INFOGEST semi-dynamic protocol in the absence and presence of a commercial supplemental enzyme preparation (a Glutalytic® based supplement, which will be marketed as Elevase®). Protein hydrolysis (OPA- ortho-phthalaldehyde - assay), molecular weight distribution (SEC-HPLC) and potential toxicity (R5 antibody-based competitive ELISA), were assessed. Our results demonstrated that under normal conditions, the complexity of the food influenced the temporal profile of protein hydrolysis and gluten breakdown throughout simulated gastric and intestinal digestion. However, treatment with the enzyme supplement significantly and acutely increased protein hydrolysis and gluten degradation in the gastric stage, and this enhanced digestion was maintained into the intestinal environment. These findings highlight the limitations of temporal gastric proteolysis and gluten degradation under normal conditions to different food types. They also show that supplemental enzyme mixes can effectively accelerate the breakdown of protein and hydrolysis of toxic gliadin fractions from the early stages of gastric digestion, thereby reducing intestinal exposure and potentially limiting the sensitization of the host."

      "abstract": "Enterococci are opportunistic pathogens that can cause severe bacterial infections. Treatment of these infections is challenging because enterococci possess intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of resistance to commonly used antibiotics, including cephalosporins. The transmembrane serine/threonine PASTA kinase, IreK, is an important determinant of enterococcal cephalosporin resistance. Upon exposure to cephalosporins, IreK becomes autophosphorylated, which stimulates its kinase activity to phosphorylate downstream substrates and drive cephalosporin resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms that modulate IreK autophosphorylation in response to cell wall stress, such as that induced by cephalosporins, remain unknown. A cytoplasmic protein, GpsB, promotes signaling by PASTA kinase homologs in other bacterial species, but the function of enterococcal GpsB has not been previously investigated. We used in vitro and in vivo approaches to test the hypothesis that enterococcal GpsB promotes IreK signaling in response to cephalosporins to drive cephalosporin resistance. We found that GpsB promotes IreK activity both in vivo and in vitro. This effect is required for cephalosporins to trigger IreK autophosphorylation and activation of an IreK-dependent signaling pathway, and thereby is also required for enterococcal intrinsic cephalosporin resistance. Moreover, analyses of GpsB mutants and a ΔireK gpsB double mutant suggest that GpsB has an additional function, beyond regulation of IreK activity, which is required for optimal growth and full cephalosporin resistance. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the mechanism of signal transduction by the PASTA kinase IreK and the mechanism of enterococcal intrinsic cephalosporin resistance. IMPORTANCE Enterococci are opportunistic pathogens that can cause severe bacterial infections. Treatment of these infections is challenging because enterococci possess intrinsic and acquired resistance to commonly used antibiotics. In particular, enterococci are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporin antibiotics, a trait that requires the activity of a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase, IreK, which belongs to the bacterial PASTA kinase family. The mechanisms by which PASTA kinases are regulated in cells are poorly understood. Here, we report that the cytoplasmic protein GpsB directly promotes IreK signaling in enterococci to drive cephalosporin resistance. Thus, we provide new insights into PASTA kinase regulation and control of enterococcal cephalosporin resistance, and suggest that GpsB could be a promising target for new therapeutics to disable cephalosporin resistance.",

For this purpose, enriched wheat pastas from different seaweeds (sea lettuce-Ulva lactuca, nori-Porphyra tenera, and wakame-Undaria pinnatifida) were made and compared with durum wheat pasta as a control treatment. Firstly, optimal cooking times were established by visual and instrumental methods. Then, the technological properties of weight gain (WG), swelling index (SI), cooking losses (CL), and moisture (H%) were determined. Protein and fiber analyses, texture profile analysis (TPA), and color measurements were also performed to evaluate the physicochemical properties. Overall, enriched pasta with seaweed revealed slightly shorter optimal cooking times than control pasta. Texture properties were also modified, with a lower value of hardness, and higher values of adhesiveness and resilience. However, due to the low percentages of seaweed (3%), noticeable effects were not appreciated. Moreover, color variations of enriched pasta were relevant due to the difference among seaweeds. Nonetheless, these additions increased the protein content and soluble fiber in these foods. In conclusion, pasta enriched with marine ingredients improved this nutritional profile, and the changes in technological properties did not have a major impact on the product quality."

      "abstract": "In this study, kiwiberry lyophilizate (KBL) was incorporated into pasta at different levels (5%, 10%, and 15% w/w). Kiwiberry fruits' characteristics (ascorbic acid, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity determination) as well as physical (cooking properties, color, microscopic structure determination, texture, and water molecular dynamics analysis by low-field NMR) and chemical analyses (proximate composition phenolic compounds composition and antioxidant activity) of KBL-enriched pasta were investigated. The replacement of semolina with KBL in the production of pasta significantly changed its culinary properties. Results showed that the addition of KBL leads to a reduction in optimal cooking time and cooking weight (47.6% and 37.3%, respectively). Additionally, a significant effect of the KBL incorporation on the color of both fresh and cooked pasta was observed. A significant reduction in the L* value for fresh (27.8%) and cooked (20.2%) pasta was found. The KBL-enriched pasta had a different surface microstructure than the control pasta and reduced firmness (on average 44.7%). Low-field NMR results have confirmed that the ingredients in kiwiberry fruit can bind the water available in fresh pasta. The heat treatment resulted in increasing the availability of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity (64.7%) of cooked pasta. Sensory evaluation scores showed that the use of 5-10% of the KBL additive could be successfully accepted by consumers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: In recent years, many studies have suggested that ancient wheat products might have beneficial effects on cardiometabolic risk profile, but little is known about their effect on gut microbiota (GM). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a replacement diet with pasta made from ancient wheat (AD) could influence the GM composition and its metabolites' production compared to a replacement diet with pasta made from modern wheat (CD). METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded crossover trial with two intervention phases was conducted on 20 clinically healthy adults (9 females; 11 males; mean age 43.1 ± 12.5 years). Study participants were assigned to consume pasta made using semi-whole flour from organic wheat that was either from ancient or modern control wheat for 8 weeks in a random order. An 8-week washout period was implemented between the interventions. Stool samples were collected from all subjects at the beginning and at the end of each intervention period. GM composition, and short- (SCFAs) and medium- chain fatty acids (MCFAs) production was evaluated. RESULTS: Dietary interventions did not produce significant diversity in the GM composition at higher ranks (phylum, class, order and family), but only at genus level. In detail, the AD significantly (adj. p < 0.05) changed the abundance of Erysipelatoclostridium spp., Bacteroides_pectinophilus_group spp., CAG-873 spp., and Holdemanella spp. The CD significantly affected the abundance of Akkermansia spp., CAG-873 spp., Hungatella spp., Lachnospiraceae_UCG-008 spp., NK4A214_group spp., Frisingicoccus spp., Megasphaera spp., Synergistes spp., and Tyzzerella spp. Regarding the production of SCFAs and MCFAs, AD resulted in a significant increase of fecal acetic (+0.7%), isobutyric (+30.1%), 2-methylbutyric (+64.2%), and isovaleric (+22.5%) acids. On the other hand, CD resulted in increased levels of isobutyric (+71.4%), 2-methylbutyric (+116.2%), isovaleric (+99%), and valeric (+21.4%) acids, and a reduction of butyric (-31.6%) and hexanoic (-66.4%) acids. CONCLUSION: A short-term replacement diet with both ancient and modern wheat pasta determined significant changes in GM composition at the genus level but notably the AD resulted in a greater beneficial impact on anti-inflammatory SCFAs."

Black beans were milled into flour using a commercial Knife or compression/decompression mill (C/D mill). The C/D-mill-derived pastas had medium protein (Combo-MP) and low protein (Cyclone-LP) concentrations. Three black bean flour pastas (Knife, Combo-MP, and Cyclone-LP) were compared to two controls: white bread and whole black beans. Treatments contained 50 g of available carbohydrate. Plasma glucose, serum insulin, and appetite measures were collected at fasting and 30, 60, 90, 150, and 180 min postprandial. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated 10-12 h postprandial. ANOVA (one-way, repeated measures) was used to evaluate satiety, gastrointestinal symptoms, sensory variables, glucose and insulin differences from baseline, and incremental area under the curve (iAUC) by time and/or treatment. Three-hour glucose and insulin iAUCs were lower with whole black beans than white bread. Black bean pasta meals increased satiety, reduced appetite, and produced numerically lower glucose and insulin responses than white bread. However, no differences were observed between pasta types, indicating a similar metabolic response regardless of milling technique. Our results provide evidence for dietary guidance to reduce postprandial glucose and related health risks through pulse food products."

      "abstract": "Pasta is a product that requires culinary processing which can affect the content of minerals in the finished product. The study aimed to examine how cooking pasta (1) in salted water (1 teaspoon-16 g of salt per 1 litre of water) or unsalted water and (2) rinsing cooked pasta with running water affects the content of minerals. Thirty-five samples of six types of pasta were analysed. The content of minerals was determined using the ICP-OES method. Retention of minerals in the cooked pasta was calculated. Taking the culinary treatment into account, the intake of minerals with pasta was assessed for children, adolescents, and adults, and the values were compared with the recommendations for the population of Poland. The analysed culinary factors had a statistically significant influence on the content of minerals. Adding salt to water when cooking pasta significantly increased the content of Na in the product, which in turn was negatively correlated with the content of other minerals. When pasta was cooked in unsalted water, it contained less Na and more other minerals than pasta cooked in salted water. Rinsing of pasta reduced the content of all minerals. Pasta is an important source of Mg, Cu, and Mn in the diet of Poles. These ingredients are particularly important to ensure correct development and functioning of the human body. The best method of culinary treatment of pasta is cooking in unsalted water without rinsing."

Processing of fruits yields a significant number of by-products in the form of pulp, peel and seeds, which are often discarded and major cause of environmental concern. Bitterness in the waste residue of citrus products is one of the leading hindrance in its valorization and supplementation in other food products. Aim of this study was to reduce the bitterness of Citrus reticulata (kinnow) pomace using enzymatic method and its supplementation in production of nutritionally rich pasta. Under optimized conditions (1U/mg enzyme naringinase concentration, temperature 50 °C, at pH 4.5 and treatment time 4 h), the maximum reduction (65.95%) of naringin (bitterness causing compound) was observed coupled with increase (60.13%) in naringenin (non-bitter compound). The debittered kinnow pomace has been further characterized for physio-chemical changes and morphological changes before and after treatment. The debittered kinnow pomace was then supplemented for the preparation of antioxidant and nutrient enriched pasta."

PURPOSE: To introduce a novel \"retensioning technique\" for arthroscopic PASTA repair and to assess the clinical and radiologic outcomes of this technique. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 24 patients whose PASTA lesion was treated using the retensioning technique between January 2011 and December 2015. The mean ± SD patient age was 57.6 ± 7.0 years (range, 43-71 years), and the mean follow-up period was 57.6 ± 23.4 months (range, 24.0-93.7 months). Sutures were placed at the edge of the PASTA lesion, tensioned, and fixed to lateral-row anchors. After surgery, shoulder range of motion (ROM) and functional scores (visual analog scale [VAS] for pain, VAS for function, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score, Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and Korean Shoulder Score) were evaluated at regular outpatient visits; at 6 months postoperatively, repair integrity was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: At 12 months postoperatively, all ROM variables were improved compared with preoperative values, and shoulder abduction was improved significantly (136.00° vs 107.08°; P = .009). At final follow-up (>24 months), the VAS pain, VAS function, and ASES scores improved, from 6.39, 4.26, and 40.09 to 1.00, 8.26, and 85.96, respectively (all P < .001). At 6 months postoperatively, 21 of the 24 patients (87.5%) underwent follow-up MRI; the postoperative repair integrity was Sugaya type 1 or 2 for all of these patients, and 13 patients showed complete improvement of the lesion compared with preoperatively. CONCLUSION: The retensioning technique showed improved ROM and pain and functional scores as well as good tendon healing on MRI scans at 6-month follow-up in the majority of patients. Thus, the retensioning technique appears to be reliable procedure for the PASTA lesion."

Bioprocessed BSG has been used as ingredient to obtain a fortified semolina pasta which can be labeled as \"high fiber\" and \"source of protein\" according to the European Community Regulation No. 1924/2006. Compared to native BSG, the use of bioprocessed BSG led to higher protein digestibility and quality indices (essential amino acid index, biological value, protein efficiency ratio, nutritional index), as well as lower predicted glycemic index. Bioprocessing also improved the technological properties of fortified pasta. Indeed, brightfield and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the formation of a more homogeneous protein network, resulting from the degradation of the arabinoxylan structure of BSG, and the release of the components entrapped into the cellular compartments. The extensive cell wall disruption contributed to the release of phenols, and conferred enhanced antioxidant activity to the fortified pasta. The persistence of the activity was demonstrated after in vitro-mimicked digestion, evaluating the protective effects of the digested pasta towards induced oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells cultures. The fortified pasta showed a peculiar sensory profile, markedly improved by the pre-treatment, thus confirming the great potential of bioprocessed BSG as health-promoting food ingredient."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment (PASTA) trial evaluated an enhanced emergency care pathway which aimed to facilitate thrombolysis in hospital. A pre-planned health economic evaluation was included. The main results showed no statistical evidence of a difference in either thrombolysis volume (primary outcome) or 90-day dependency. However, counter-intuitive findings were observed with the intervention group showing fewer thrombolysis treatments but less dependency. AIMS: Cost-effectiveness of the PASTA intervention was examined relative to standard care. METHODS: A within trial cost-utility analysis estimated mean costs and quality-adjusted life years over 90 days' time horizon. Costs were derived from resource utilization data for individual trial participants. Quality-adjusted life years were calculated by mapping modified Rankin scale scores to EQ-5D-3L utility tariffs. A post-hoc subgroup analysis examined cost-effectiveness when trial hospitals were divided into compliant and non-compliant with recommendations for a stroke specialist thrombolysis rota. RESULTS: The trial enrolled 1214 patients: 500 PASTA and 714 standard care. There was no evidence of a quality-adjusted life year difference between groups [0·007 (95% CI: -0·003 to 0·018)] but costs were lower in the PASTA group [-£1473 (95% CI: -£2736 to -£219)]. There was over 97.5% chance that the PASTA pathway would be considered cost-effective. There was no evidence of a difference in costs at seven thrombolysis rota compliant hospitals but costs at eight non-complaint hospitals costs were lower in PASTA with more dominant cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses indicate that the PASTA pathway may be considered cost-effective, particularly if deployed in areas where stroke specialist availability is limited.Trial Registration: ISRCTN12418919 www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12418919.",

This study comprehensively examined the impact of fermentation on the microbial composition of the culture, pasta, its subsequent effects on glycemic responses and gut microbiota in overweight men and women (>25 kg/m2) compared to a conventional, non-fermented pasta. Two, randomized crossover trials were performed. Study A examined acute feeding responses to each product wherein fasted participants completed a meal tolerance test comprised of 75 g of conventional or sourdough pasta to examine glycemic responses. Results showed enhanced gastric emptying with sourdough, but no difference in overall blood glucose, insulin or satiety hormone responses between the treatments. Study B consisted of three standard oral glucose tolerance tests as well as fecal collection for sequencing at baseline and following each pasta intervention (150 g or 2 serving/d for 5 days) followed by a 2-week washout period. Results showed no differential impact of either pasta treatment on glucose tolerance. Analysis of fecal bacterial and fungal (mycobiome) microbiota showed no change at the individual species or genus levels. However, fungi were adaptive following chronic pasta consumption with decreases in alpha diversity of fungi following sourdough, but not conventional pasta. This was accompanied by reductions in total fecal short chain fatty acid concentrations. In conclusion, sourdough fermentation did not change the overall glycemic properties of the pasta, incretin responses or bacterial gut microbiota, but appears to impact microbiome fungal community structure with chronic consumption."

Since OFI may also have antioxidant and anti-atherogenic properties, we hypothesized that its supplementation might reduce atherogenic lipoproteins, including small, dense low-density lipoproteins (sdLDL). Forty-nine patients (13 men and 36 women, mean age: 56 ± 5 years) with one or two criteria for the metabolic syndrome weekly consumed 500 g of pasta supplemented with 3% OFI extract (30% of insoluble polysaccharides with high antioxidant power) for 1 month. The full LDL subclass profile was assessed by gel electrophoresis (Lipoprint, Quantimetrix, Redondo Beach, CA, USA). After 1 month of pasta supplementation, waist circumference (p = 0.0297), plasma glucose (p < 0.0001), triglycerides (p = 0.0137), plasma creatinine (p = 0.0244), urea and aspartate transaminase (p < 0.0001 for each) significantly decreased. A percentage increase in larger, less atherogenic LDL-1 (p = 0.0002), with a concomitant reduction in smaller, denser LDL-2 (p < 0.0001) and LDL-3 (p = 0.0004), were found. LDL-4 and-5 decreased, although not significantly. This is the first intervention study suggesting that pasta enriched with an OFI extract may have beneficial effects on some metabolic parameters and the LDL particle sizes, reducing atherogenic sdLDL. Future studies will help to establish if these findings impact cardiovascular outcomes."

Although partial rotator cuff tears have a high prevalence, there is still controversy over their proper surgical treatment. Different surgical procedures have been suggested when partial tears involve the articular side of the rotator cuff, such as arthroscopic debridement of the tear with or without acromioplasty, tear completion and repair, and transtendinous in situ repair. Although multiple repair techniques have been described, significant clinical data to definitively support one technique over the others are currently lacking. We describe an arthroscopic technique for repair of a partial articular supraspinatus tendon avulsion that avoids the transtendinous insertion of suture anchors to preserve the tendon integrity."

In this paper, an EU-validation procedure for screening methods was successfully applied to a multivariate FT-NIR spectroscopic method for the screening of durum wheat pasta samples adulterated with common wheat at the screening target concentration of 3%. Good results in terms of the cut-off value (2.32% mass fraction of soft wheat) and false suspect rates (0.1% for blanks; 13% at 1% mass fraction) demonstrated that the present validation approach would be a proof-of-strategy to be used for multivariate infrared methods applied for screening purposes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease is considered a central issue in public health and great attention is payed to nutritional approaches, including consumption of functional foods to reduce CV risk in individuals without indications for anti-atherosclerotic drugs. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) is an important anti-atherogenic property of HDL and a marker of CV risk. We evaluated the effect of a daily consumption of an innovative whole-wheat synbiotic pasta, compared to a control whole-wheat pasta, on serum ATP binding cassette G1 (ABCG1)-mediated CEC in healthy overweight or obese individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Study participants (n = 41) were randomly allocated to either innovative or control pasta, consumed daily for twelve weeks. Serum CEC was measured before and after the dietary intervention, by a well-established radioisotopic technique on Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells transfected with human ABCG1. The innovative synbiotic pasta consumption was associated to a significantly higher post treatment/baseline ratio of ABCG1-mediated CEC values with respect to control pasta (mean ratio 1.05 ± 0.037 and 0.95 ± 0.042 respectively, p < 0.05). Analysis of the relationship between ABCG1-mediated CEC and glycemia, homocysteine, total folates and interleukin-6 showed specific changes in the correlations between HDL function and glycemia, oxidative and inflammatory markers only after synbiotic pasta consumption. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on serum CEC improvement obtained by a new synbiotic functional pasta consumption, in absence of lipid profile modifications, in overweight/obese participants. This pilot study suggests that a simple dietary intervention can be a promising approach to CV preservation through improving of athero-protective HDL function.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of preparation method and particle size on digestion of starch in fresh and dry pasta types. Pasta samples were boiled, refrigerated and re-heated, with samples collected after each stage, and then prepared as small (2 mm) and large (5 mm) particles for subsequent starch digestibility testing and logarithm of slope analyses. There were significant main effects of particle size (F1,24 = 568.895, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.960) and processing treatment (F2,24 = 19.897, p < 0.001 ηp2 = 0.624) on starch digestibility overall, however the main effect of pasta type was not significant at the p < 0.05 level (F1,24 = 2.978, p = 0.097, ηp2 = 0.110). Particle size had the largest effect on digestibility, and the extent of starch digestion was at least 50% lower in samples prepared as large particles compared with small particles. The most digestible sample was the boiled fresh-type pasta prepared as small particles (C∞ = 57.9%) and cold storage alone and/or with subsequent re-heating significantly reduced the extent of digestion in this sample to ∼40.6%. In the dry pasta type, processing treatment had no significant effects on starch digestibility. The rate constant, k, was not significantly altered by processing treatment or pasta type (k = 0.0275 min-1, mean of all samples). These findings suggest that cold-storage and re-heating treatments have limited potential to impact on glycaemic responses and highlight the importance of masticated particle size as a potential rate-limiting factor in digestibility studies.",

This paper investigates the effect of two Mediterranean diets, which differed for lower or higher pasta intake, on body weight change in individuals with obesity. METHODS & RESULTS: Forty-nine volunteers finished a quasi-experimental 6-month two-parallel group dietary intervention. Participants were assigned to a low-energy high pasta (HP) or to a low-energy low Pasta (LP) group on the basis of their pasta intake (HP ≥ 5 or LP ≤ 3 times/week). Anthropometrics, blood pressure and heart rate were measured every month. Weight maintenance was checked at month 12. Body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, BIA), food intake (24-h recall plus a 7-day carbohydrate record) and the perceived quality of life (36-item short-form health survey, SF-36) were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Blood samples were collected at baseline and month 6 to assess glucose and lipid metabolism. After 6-month intervention, body weight reduction was -10 ± 8% and -7 ± 4% in HP and LP diet, respectively, and it remained similar at month 12. Both dietary interventions improved anthropometric parameters, body composition, glucose and lipid metabolism, but no significant differences were observed between treatment groups. No differences were observed for blood pressure and heart rate between treatments and among times. HP diet significantly improved perception of quality of life for the physical component. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of pasta consumption frequency, low-energy Mediterranean diets were successful in improving anthropometrics, physiological parameters and dietary habits after a 6-month weight-loss intervention.

We evaluated performance of our interoperable artificial pancreas system (iAPS) in the at-home setting, running on an unlocked smartphone, with scheduled meal challenges in a randomized crossover trial. Methods: Ten adults with type 1 diabetes completed 2 weeks of AID-based control and 2 weeks of conventional therapy in random order where they consumed regular pasta or extra-long grain white rice as part of a complete dinner meal on six different occasions in both arms (each meal thrice in random order). Surveys assessed satisfaction with AID use. Results: Postprandial differences in conventional therapy were 10,919.0 mg/dL × min (95% confidence interval [CI] 3190.5-18,648.0, P = 0.009) for glucose area under the curve (AUC) and 40.9 mg/dL (95% CI 4.6-77.3, P = 0.03) for peak continuous glucose monitor glucose, with rice showing greater increases than pasta. White rice resulted in a lower estimate over pasta by a factor of 0.22 (95% CI 0.08-0.63, P = 0.004) for AUC under 70 mg/dL. These glycemic differences in both meal types were reduced under AID-based control and were not statistically significant, where 0-2 h insulin delivery decreased by 0.45 U for pasta (P = 0.001) and by 0.27 U for white rice (P = 0.01). Subjects reported high overall satisfaction with the iAPS. Conclusions: The AID system running on an unlocked smartphone improved postprandial glucose control over conventional therapy in the setting of challenging meals in the outpatient setting.

      "abstract": "Of all of the stages in the supply chain, more food waste comes from households than any other sector. A Dutch composition analysis showed that the solid food waste (including sauces, fats, and dairy products) from household waste amounted to 48.0 kg per person per year (in 2013), of which 5.0 kg consisted of cooked rice and pasta. These two product groups were numbers 1 and 3 in terms of relative waste: 34% of the purchased quantity of rice and 23% of that of pasta was wasted. Using questionnaires, we discovered that Dutch consumers mainly throw away food because they prepare too much of it. The same is true for rice and pasta because they increase greatly in volume when cooked. The water uptake ratio of rice is 2.5 (2.3-2.8) and that of pasta is 1.8 (1.5-2.3), which increases the chances of consumers overestimating portions. In 2013, more than half of the people surveyed did not measure pasta and rice portions. In view of this, the Netherlands Nutrition Centre developed a measuring cup called the Eetmaatje, which is marked with the recommended volumes for Dutch adults for different types of pasta and rice in terms of dry weight. The theoretical reduction of food waste the Eetmaatje provides is calculated to be ~6% for pasta and 21% for rice, or 12.5% combined. Between 2014 and 2019, more than 1.6 million Eetmaatje cups were distributed for free among Dutch households. Over that period, the measuring of pasta and rice by Dutch households increased. Most people (85-89%) in a panel of consumers who own an Eetmaatje think it is handy or very handy to use. The majority of those in the panel (50-80%) say that they use the Eetmaatje most times when they prepare a meal. Four out of five of those in the panel (77-87%) are convinced that the Eetmaatje helps them waste less pasta and rice. The Eetmaatje functions as a nudge to change cooking behavior and thus food waste behavior. Consumers who measure their pasta using the Eetmaatje self-reported that they produced less total food waste. The measured household waste of cooked rice and pasta seems to show a downward trend since the introduction of the cup. There is strong evidence that the Eetmaatje has increased the number of Dutch households measuring rice and pasta and thereby reducing food waste."

The primary objective of our study is to test the impact of labeling whole grain pasta with a health message descriptor displayed at the point-of-purchase (POP) on consumer choice in a campus dining setting. The study was conducted in a large US college dining venue during lunch service; data were collected during a nine-week period, for a total of 18 days of observation. Each day, an information treatment (i.e., no-message condition; vitamin message; fiber message) was alternated assigned to whole grain penne. Over the study period, the selection of four pasta options (white penne, whole grain penne, spinach fettuccine, and tortellini) were recorded and compiled for analysis. Logistic regression and pairwise comparison analyses were performed to estimate the impact of health messages on diners' decisions to choose whole grain penne among the four pasta types. Our results indicate that only the message about vitamin benefits had a significant effect on this choice, with a 7.4% higher probability of selecting this pasta than the no-message condition and 6.0% higher than the fiber message condition. These findings suggest that psychological health claims (e.g., reduction of fatigue) of whole grains seem more attractive than physiological health claims (e.g., maintaining a healthy weight) for university students. In line with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, our results suggest that small changes made at the POP have the potential to contribute to significant improvements in diet (e.g., achieving recommended levels of dietary fiber). These findings have important implications for food service practitioners in delivering information with the greatest impact on healthy food choices.",

The intense (up to circa, (ca.) 70%) decrease in the peptide profile area and (up to two-fold) increase in total free amino acids, compared to the untreated raw materials, highlighted the potential of lactic acid bacteria to positively affect their in vitro protein digestibility. Fermented and unfermented ingredients have been characterized and used to fortify pasta made under pilot-plant scale. Due to the high contents of protein (ca. 13%) and fiber (ca. 6%) and according to the Regulation of the European Community (EC) No. 1924/2006 fortified pasta can be labelled as a \"source of fiber\" and a \"source of protein\". The use of non-wheat flours increased the content of anti-nutritional factors as compared to the control pasta. Nevertheless, fermentation with lactic acid bacteria led to significant decreases in condensed tannins (ca. 50%), phytic acid and raffinose (ca. ten-fold) contents as compared to the unfermented pasta. Moreover, total free amino acids and in vitro protein digestibility values were 60% and 70%, respectively, higher than pasta made only with semolina. Sensory analysis highlighted a strong effect of the fortification on the sensory profile of pasta."

Commonly accepted techniques, such as transtendinous repair or tear takedown with primary repair, may violate healthy tendon tissue and increase the suture anchor density. In this note, we describe an outside-in double row-equivalent technique for repair of partial articular-sided rotator cuff tears. A medial row of inverted horizontal mattress stitches is placed percutaneously using spinal needles to shuttle partially absorbable braided sutures into the joint. The technique may incorporate a soft tissue biceps tenodesis into the rotator cuff with a second, oblique medial row mattress stitch. Suture limbs are retrieved and tied in the subacromial space and then secured to a lateral anchor. The result is a side-to-side double row-equivalent rotator cuff repair, anatomically reproducing the footprint of the rotator cuff without removing healthy tissue. We believe this is an efficient and reproducible technique that preserves intact bursal tissue, limits implant costs, and produces reliable healing in partial articular-sided tears of the rotator cuff."

This study is designed to collect data on clinical background characteristics, drug adherence, drug dosage, neurological severity at admission and discharge, infarct or hematoma size, acute therapy including recanalization therapy or reverse drug therapy, and timing of OAC re-initiation. Patient enrollment started in April 2016 and the target patient number is 1000 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The PASTA prospective registry should identify the status of stroke patients taking OAC in the current clinical practice in Japan.",

METHODS: A retrospective review of a consecutive series of arthroscopic trans-tendon suture bridge repair with tenotomized pathologic biceps tendon augmentation was conducted. Total 115 patients (44 men and 71 women) with minimum 2 years follow-up were enrolled in our study. Their mean age was 59.7 ± 7.6 (38-77) years and mean follow-up were 6.9 ± 2.5 (2 ~ 10) years. Clinical assessment and radiological outcomes using post-operative MRI were evaluated at last follow-up. RESULTS: All these tears were high-grade PASTA lesions in which mean cuff tear size (exposed footprint) was anteroposterior length 15.7 ± 6.3 mm (5-25 mm) and mediolateral width 10.1 ± 3.6 mm 6.4 mm (5-16 mm).

ROM such as forward flexion, abduction, and internal rotation to the back were improved from a pre-operative mean of 148° (±24), 144° (±24), L2 (Buttock-T7) to a post-operative mean of 161° (±10), 160.0° (±12), and T12 (L3-T5), respectively (p value < 0.001). Follow-up MRI showed Sugaya classification type I in 24 patients (20.9%), type II in 78 patients (67.8%), type III in 11 patients (9.6%) and type 4 in 2 patients (1.7%) were found. As complications, shoulder stiffness was found in five patients, Popeye deformity in two patients and retear in two patients. Revision surgery of the retear was performed in 2 patients. At the last follow-up, 17% (20/115 patients) reported occasional discomfort at the extremes of range of motion during a heavy work or sports activities. CONCLUSIONS: In high-grade PASTA lesions, arthroscopic trans-tendon suture bridge repair with tenotomized pathologic biceps tendon augmentation could be a useful treatment modality capable of preserving rotator cuff footprint, providing simultaneous biceps tenodesis, inducing better tendon healing and possibly preventing tendon buckling and residual pain of the conventional trans-tendon repair methods. These specific methods showed satisfactory outcomes and decreased residual shoulder discomfort (17%) at mid-term follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, Retrospective case study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Synbiotic foods, which combine the action of prebiotics and probiotics along the gastrointestinal tract, can affect inflammatory and glucose-related markers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on inflammatory and glycemia-related markers of a whole-grain pasta containing barley β-glucans and Bacillus coagulans BC30, 6086 in healthy overweight or obese volunteers. METHODS: A single-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled dietary intervention study was carried out. Forty-one healthy sedentary overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥30) volunteers, aged 30-65 y and low consumers of fruit and vegetables, ate 1 serving/d of whole-grain control (CTR) or innovative (INN) pasta for 12 wk and maintained their habitual diets. Biological samples were collected at baseline and every 4 wk for primary (plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] and fasting plasma lipid profile) and secondary outcomes (glycemia-related markers, blood pressure, fecal microbiota composition, and body weight). Between (CTR compared with INN) and within (among weeks) group differences were tested for the whole population and for subgroups stratified by baseline values of BMI (≥30) and glycemia (≥100 mg/dL). RESULTS: INN or CTR pasta consumption had no effect on primary and secondary outcomes over time, except for a significant increase in plasma γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) after 12 wk of CTR pasta consumption. Comparisons between intervention groups revealed differences only at 12 wk: plasma GGT was higher in the CTR group; plasma hs-CRP, plasma LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, and Bifidobacterium spp. were lower in the INN subgroup of obese volunteers; plasma resistin was lower and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance was higher in the INN subgroup of hyperglycemic volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: A daily serving of a synbiotic whole-grain pasta had limited effects on primary and secondary outcomes in the entire group of volunteers but affected glycemia- and lipid-related markers and resistin in a subgroup of healthy obese or hyperglycemic volunteers. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02236533.",

Some of these lesions can engage on the glenoid during motion, producing instability and potentially affecting the success of a labral repair. The remplissage was developed to address these Hill-Sachs lesions and improve stability. French for \"filling,\" the goal of the remplissage is to fill the Hill-Sachs lesion with the infraspinatus tendon, preventing the margins of the lesion from engaging with the glenoid. Analogous to restoring the rotator cuff footprint during repair, a primary goal of the remplissage is to have the infraspinatus cover the Hill-Sachs lesion. The partial articular supraspinatus tendon avulsion (PASTA) bridge was originally developed for partial-thickness rotator cuff repair in situ, but additional uses have been found in other settings. The PASTA bridge uses a medial row horizontal mattress with a lateral anchor to create a linked construct to effectively distribute force and provide adequate coverage of the lesion. Knotless anchor technology used in this procedure prevents the need for arthroscopic knot tying and potentially damaging knot stacks. This Technical Note describes a remplissage technique using the PASTA bridge configuration to address Hill-Sachs lesions associated with recurrent glenohumeral instability."

METHODS: Of 22 patients, 18 (82%) were available for follow-up evaluation after a mean of 15 ± 2 years (range, 12-17 years). The mean age at time of surgery was 55 ± 9 years (range, 35-66 years). The Constant score was used as the primary outcome instrument to evaluate shoulder function. Furthermore, the University of California-Los Angeles shoulder score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, and the Subjective Shoulder Value were collected. The patients' satisfaction with the outcome was investigated. Tendon integrity of the affected shoulder at final follow-up was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound in 89% of the cohort. RESULTS: Overall, 94% of the patients were very satisfied or satisfied with the outcome. The average Constant score of the affected shoulder was 78 ± 21 points; the University of California-Los Angeles score, 31 ± 7 points; the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 85 ± 24 points; and the Subjective Shoulder Value, 83% ± 21%. Radiologic evaluation showed progression to a full-thickness rotator cuff tear in 6% (1/16), and 60% of the patients (6/10) showed persistent signs of partial tearing evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: At long-term follow-up, arthroscopic treatment of medium-sized PASTA lesions resulted in good clinical results together with a high satisfaction level of the patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite evidence from clinical trials that intravenous (IV) thrombolysis is a cost-effective treatment for selected acute ischaemic stroke patients, there remain large variations in the rate of IV thrombolysis delivery between stroke services. This study is evaluating whether an enhanced care pathway delivered by paramedics (the Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment (PASTA)) could increase the number of patients who receive IV thrombolysis treatment. METHODS: Study design: Cluster randomised trial with economic analysis and parallel process evaluation. SETTING: National Health Service ambulance services, emergency departments and hyper-acute stroke units within three geographical regions of England and Wales. Randomisation: Ambulance stations within each region are the units of randomisation. According to station allocation, paramedics based at a station deliver the PASTA pathway (intervention) or continue with standard stroke care (control). Study intervention: The PASTA pathway includes structured pre-hospital information collection, prompted pre-notification, structured handover of information in hospital and assistance with simple tasks during the initial hospital assessment. Study-trained intervention group paramedics deliver this pathway to adults within 4 h of suspected stroke onset. Study control: Standard stroke care according to national and local guidelines for the pre-hospital and hospital assessment of suspected stroke. PARTICIPANTS: Participants enrolled in the study are adults with confirmed stroke who were assessed by a study paramedic within 4 h of symptom onset. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Proportion of participants receiving IV thrombolysis. SAMPLE SIZE: 1297 participants provide 90% power to detect a 10% difference in the proportion of patients receiving IV thrombolysis. DISCUSSION: The results from this trial will determine whether an enhanced care pathway delivered by paramedics can increase thrombolysis delivery rates.

Size exclusion-HPLC and electrophoresis analysis were used to investigate changes in the gluten network arrangement as affected by the microwave treatment. Rheological properties of dough, cooking quality and sensory properties of pasta were also assessed. Results suggested that the microwave treatment on hydrated durum wheat kernels blocks gluten protein conformation through SS bonds formation and the free -SH are no longer able to create a strong network during pasta processing, due to the conformational changes. Rheological study of dough confirmed that the modifications induced by microwave treatment greatly affected pasta making characteristics of wheat flour, with significant negative consequences on product quality, especially for pasta cooking quality. Pasta from treated durum wheat showed low sensory quality, mainly due to high bulkiness and adhesiveness.",

During pasta-making, kansui (an alkaline salt with reduced sodium) was added at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% (total flour weight basis) to modify semolina gluten aggregation reactions in dough production and pasta cooking. Adding 1.0% kansui enhanced pasta dough elasticity and strength, but cooking quality was changed barely. These consequences may be attributed to more polymeric glutenin incorporated in the network through thiol (SH)/disulfide (SS) exchange or other non-redox reactions/interactions by introducing kansui, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, FTIR, and HPLC results. The protein cross-linking induced by kansui (1.0%) improved the texture properties of pasta without compromising the cooking and coloration characteristics. Considering the process convenience and food safety of reducing sodium chloride with natural alkaline salt reagent in industrial pasta production, this could be a potential approach for sodium reduction.",

      "abstract": "Partial articular-sided supraspinatus tendon avulsion (PASTA) tears are a common clinical problem that can require surgical intervention to reduce patient symptoms. Currently, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal repair technique. The PASTA Bridge technique was developed by the senior author to address these types of lesions. A controlled laboratory study was performed comparing the PASTA Bridge with a standard transtendon rotator cuff repair to confirm its biomechanical efficacy. A 50% articular-sided partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon was created on 6 matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders. For each matched pair, 1 humerus received a PASTA Bridge repair, whereas the contralateral side received a repair using a single suture anchor with a horizontal mattress suture. The ultimate load, yield load, and stiffness were determined from the load-displacement results for each sample. Video tracking software was used to determine the cyclic displacement of each sample at the articular margin and the repair site. Strain at the margin and repair site was then calculated using this collected data. There were no significant differences between the 2 repairs in ultimate load (P = .577), strain at the repair site (P = .355), or strain at the margin (P = .801). No instance of failure was due to the PASTA Bridge construct itself. The results of this study have established that the PASTA Bridge is biomechanically equivalent to the transtendon repair technique. The PASTA Bridge is technically easy, percutaneous, reproducible, and is associated with fewer risks.",

The use of sweet potato flour to replace fractions of wheat flour, regardless of blanching treatment, resulted in significant (p < .05) increase in water holding capacity (WHC), cooked pasta water uptake and solid leaching out and freeze-thaw stability of produced pasta. For instance, treatment containing 40% of nonblanched sweet potato flour and held at 55C resulted in 27% point increase in WHC compared to the control. Sweet potato flour was also contributed to the decrease in treatments pasting viscosities and in cooked pasta hardness. Cooked pasta hardness was significantly (p < .05) decreased from 255.6 N to 187.5, and 152.6 N when using 15% blanched and 40% nonblanched sweet potato flour replacements, respectively. Flow behavior index of wheat flour treatments containing fractions of sweet potato flour were fitted in a shear thinning model. Quality indices of pasta made using fractions of sweet potato were equivalent to or sometimes superior to that of the control sample. Results indicated the possible enhancement of pasta nutritional quality including firmness, cooking loss, and water uptake without impairing consumer acceptability. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The use of sweet potato flour in pasta would enhance the nutritional and physicochemical properties of developed pasta and pasta products. Furthermore, since sweet potato is not cultivated most of the year; sweet potato flour pasta would be better utilized in food processing and is expected to enhance sweet potato consumption year around.",

      "abstract": "Pasta aside from bread is the most consumed cereal-based product in the world. Its taste and cooking ease makes it the basis of many cuisines. The pasta dough formed by mixing flour and water is extruded through an extrusion die to mould the appropriate pasta form and is dried to obtain a stable product. The concentration of moisture in the pasta dough is a one of key parameters determining the final quality of the product. Monitoring the moisture content of pasta after extrusion is also critically important. It enables a selection of suitable drying conditions that ensure the appropriate parameters of pasta, such as texture, color and taste, are met. A method for the quantitative determination of moisture content in pasta dough and in pasta based on the partial least squares treatment of infrared spectra registered using a single-reflection attenuated total reflectance diamond accessory is described. Results of a similar quality were found using models derived from near infrared spectra obtained in a diffuse reflectance mode and slightly worse based on Raman spectra. Relative standard errors of prediction calculated for moisture quantification by ATR/NIR/Raman techniques amounted to 2.54/3.16/5.56% and 2.15/3.32/5.67%, for calibration and validation sets, respectively. The proposed procedures can be used for fast and efficient pasta moisture quantification and may replace the current, more laborious methods used.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The consumption of whole-grain food-including pasta-has been increasing steadily. In the case of whole-grain pasta, given the many different producers, it seems important to have some objective parameters to define its overall quality. In this study, commercial whole-grain pasta samples representative of the Italian market have been characterized from both molecular and electronic-senses (electronic nose and electronic tongue) standpoint in order to provide a survey of the properties of different commercial samples. Only 1 pasta product showed very low levels of heat damage markers (furosine and pyrraline), suggesting that this sample underwent to low temperature dry treatment. In all samples, the furosine content was directly correlated to protein structural indices, since protein structure compactness increased with increasing levels of heat damage markers. Electronic senses were able to discriminate among pasta samples according to the intensity of heat treatment during the drying step. Pasta sample with low furosine content was discriminated by umami taste and by sensors responding to aliphatic and inorganic compounds. Data obtained with this multidisciplinary approach are meant to provide hints for identifying useful indices for pasta quality. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: As observed for semolina pasta, objective parameters based on heat-damage were best suited to define the overall quality of wholegrain pasta, almost independently of compositional differences among commercial samples. Drying treatments of different intensity also had an impact on instrumental sensory traits that may provide a reliable alternative to analytical determination of chemical markers of heat damage in all cases where there is a need for avoiding time-consuming procedures.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Pasta hydration and cooking requirements make in-package microwave pasteurization of pasta a processing challenge. The objective of this study was to assess instrumental and sensory attributes of microwave-treated pasta in comparison to conventionally cooked pasta. Fettuccine pasta was parboiled for 0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 min, pasteurized by microwaves at 915 MHz, then stored under refrigeration for 1 week. Pastas were evaluated by a trained sensory panel and with rheometry. Total pasta heat treatment affected both rheological and sensory behaviors; these differences were attributed to ultrastructure differences. Significant nonlinear behavior and dominant fluid-like behavior was observed in all pastas at strains >1%. Sensory results suggested microwave pasteurization may intensify the attributes associated with the aging of pasta such as retrogradation. A clear trend between magnitude of heat treatment and attribute intensity was not observed for all sensory attributes tested. The microwave pasta with the longest parboil time showed rheological behavior most similar to conventionally cooked pasta. Principal component analysis revealed that no microwave-treated pasta was similar to the control pasta. However, pasta parboiled for 9 min before microwave treatment had the greatest number of similar sensory attributes, followed by pasta parboiled for 6 or 12 min. Further study is needed to determine overall consumer acceptance of microwave-treated pasta and whether the differences in sensory and rheological behavior would impact consumer liking. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of this study may be applied to optimize microwave pasteurization processes for cooked pasta and similar products, such as rice. The measurement and analysis procedures can be used to evaluate processing effects on a variety of different foods to determine overall palatability.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: This study investigated the effects of substituting wheat flour with fractions of different starch types and egg levels on pasta quality. First order mixture response surface model was used where the effects of various starch types and egg levels on pasta quality were evaluated. Coefficients of estimation were determined and fractional contribution of wheat, starch type and egg levels were evaluated. Egg levels negatively (p < .05) impacted treatments pasting viscosities, except in potato starch and rice flour. Stabilized rice bran peak viscosity increased from 215.0 to 3420.0 cP with decrease in egg level from 33 to 0%. Flow behavior index of treatments solution with various fractions of starch types and egg level ranged from 0.34 to 1.42 and was significantly (p < .05) lower than control (i.e., 2.15) indicating a better fit as a shear thinning model. Water holding capacity values of acorn starch and lupine flour were the greatest among treatment ranging from 86.8% to 176.0% and from 83.3% to 152.0%, respectively. Results also showed a possible modification of cooked pasta quality including firmness, stickiness, cooking loss, and water uptake, keeping with consumer acceptability through varying starch type and egg level. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Results show that flour and starch type and egg level interaction play significant role in pasta blends formulation. Moreover, substitution of wheat flour with acorn, native or modified corn and potato starches fractions, as well as with lupine, rice, tapioca, and stabilized rice bran flours would have significant effects on the physical properties and acceptability of various cereal products. For instance, the use of rice bran in potentially developed products would enhance the consumption of whole grain foods, resulting in improved intake of fiber and other healthy components.",

This systematic review aimed at assessing comprehensively and in-depth the potential benefit of pasta on cardio-metabolic disease risk factors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Following a standard protocol, we conducted a systematic literature search of PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled dietary intervention trials that examined pasta and pasta-related fiber and grain intake in relation to cardio-metabolic risk factors of interest. Studies comparing postprandial glucose response to pasta with that to bread or potato were quantitatively summarized using meta-analysis of standardized mean difference. Evidence from studies with pasta as part of low-GI dietary intervention and studies investigating different types of pasta were qualitatively summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Pasta meals have significantly lower postprandial glucose response than bread or potato meals, but evidence was lacking in terms of how the intake of pasta can influence cardio-metabolic disease risk. More long-term randomized controlled trials are needed where investigators directly contrast the cardio-metabolic effects of pasta and bread or potato. Long-term prospective cohort studies with required data available should also be analyzed regarding the effect of pasta intake on disease endpoints.",

      "abstract": "Cooking by boiling dry pasta could have varying degrees of influence on nutritional and functional components. In the present study, its effect on total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity, as well as on the comprehensive profile of free and bound phenolics, was investigated in six commercial gluten-free (GF) pasta products. Overall, the heat treatment caused a significant reduction (P<0.01) of the total phenolic content as well as FRAP reducing power and ORAC radical scavenging, with significant differences among the pasta samples considered. The highest values were recorded in free phenolic fraction remaining in black rice (41mggallic acid equivalents100g-1 and 25mmolTrolox Equivalents100g-1) and quinoa (24mggallic acid equivalents100g-1 and 14mmolTrolox Equivalents100g-1) cooked GF pasta. Significant correlations (P<0.01) could be found between total phenolics and both the antioxidant capacity assays performed. UHPLC-ESI/QTOF-MS mass profiling allowed confirming the spectrophotometric results, while identifying the amount of free and bound fractions. Among phenolic classes, lignans exhibited the highest decrease during the cooking process, followed by stilbenes and flavonoids. However, phenolic acids and other phenolics showed the highest stability. Furthermore, cooking by boiling strongly lowered the bound-to-free ratio of phenolic compounds, by an averaged factor ranging from 14-folds for flavonoids to 5-folds for other classes of phenolics.",

Healthy dietary habits are important modifiable factors that can favor a healthy aging phenotype. Many studies have demonstrated benefits for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus resulting from the traditional Mediterranean foods. Opuntia Ficus Indica (OFI), widespread in the Mediterranean basin, belongs to the Cactaceae family. It is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, products containing extracts from OFI fruits or cladodes have been used to control obesity and other metabolic parameters, such as glycemia and lipid profile. The aim of this study was to analyze the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of pasta with 3% of OFI cladode extracts added to show its beneficial effect in human health. We performed a single arm longitudinal intervention study in 42 healthy volunteers, administrating 500 g/week of this functional pasta for 30 days. Our pasta had antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties with putative effect on the aging process and related metabolic diseases. We also demonstrated a hypoglycemic effect. The results are preliminary, but it is possible to speculate that our pasta could be considered an effective food for the prevention of age-related metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial signaling systems such as protein kinases and quorum sensing have become increasingly attractive targets for the development of novel antimicrobial agents in a time of rising antibiotic resistance. The family of bacterial Penicillin-binding-protein And Serine/Threonine kinase-Associated (PASTA) kinases is of particular interest due to the role of these kinases in regulating resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. As such, small-molecule kinase inhibitors that target PASTA kinases may prove beneficial as treatments adjunctive to β-lactam therapy. Despite this interest, only limited progress has been made in identifying functional inhibitors of the PASTA kinases that have both activity against the intact microbe and high kinase specificity. Here, we report the results of a small-molecule screen that identified GSK690693, an imidazopyridine aminofurazan-type kinase inhibitor that increases the sensitivity of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to various β-lactams by inhibiting the PASTA kinase PrkA. GSK690693 potently inhibited PrkA kinase activity biochemically and exhibited significant selectivity for PrkA relative to the Staphylococcus aureus PASTA kinase Stk1. Furthermore, other imidazopyridine aminofurazans could effectively inhibit PrkA and potentiate β-lactam antibiotic activity to varying degrees. The presence of the 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (alkynol) moiety was important for both biochemical and antimicrobial activity. Finally, mutagenesis studies demonstrated residues in the back pocket of the active site are important for GSK690693 selectivity. These data suggest that targeted screens can successfully identify PASTA kinase inhibitors with both biochemical and antimicrobial specificity. Moreover, the imidazopyridine aminofurazans represent a family of PASTA kinase inhibitors that have the potential to be optimized for selective PASTA kinase inhibition.",

The Flash Profiling method was used to evaluate sensory characteristics. Samples within each set were ranked according to selected descriptors. One hundred volatile compounds were identified by solid-phase microextraction-gas chomatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: For Italian samples, the sensory notes of basil/aromatic herbs, acid and cooked tomato were among those perceived most by the assessors, whereas, in Spanish samples, the sensory attributes of garlic/onion and onion/sweet pepper and, in Italian samples, cooked tomato were among those found most frequently. Data were elaborated using multivariate statistical approaches and interesting correlations were observed among the different sensory attributes and related volatile compounds. CONCLUSION: Spanish samples were characterized by the highest content of volatiles linked to the thermal treatment of tomatoes and to raw and sautéed garlic and onion, whereas the Italian samples were characterized by terpenic compounds typical of basil and volatile molecules derived from fresh tomato. These results confirm the influence of both formulation and production processes on the aromatic profile (sensory attributes and volatile compounds) of tomato products, which is probably related to the different eating habits and culinary traditions in Italy and Spain. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The partial articular supraspinatus tendon avulsion (PASTA) lesion represents a very common type of rotator cuff pathology seen in rehabilitation. When conservative treatment fails, surgery is generally required. Success of recovery depends on several factors, including: repair techniques, healing process related to timing, rehabilitation programs, and patient compliance with home exercises. To date, most treatment modalities and rehabilitation programs are based on clinical experience rather than scientific evidence. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to provide an overview on the PASTA lesion, discuss the common treatment approaches adopted to date and to propose a rehabilitation program based on the available scientific evidence.

DIAGNOSTICS: For the diagnosis of PASTA lesions, arthroscopic evaluation of the supraspinatus tendon is key. Preoperative imaging alone is usually not sufficient to make the treatment decision. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: For non-significant partial tears of less than 50 % of the tendon thickness a simple debridement is indicated. Two basic repair techniques, a transtendon repair technique and a repair after tear completion, can be distinguished. In PASTA lesions, a repair is generally preferred to debridement. RESULTS: Results in the literature do not favor one repair technique over the other. Prospective randomized trials comparing debridement with repair are lacking in the literature. From a technical standpoint tear completion and repair seem to be a bit more reproducible.",

      "abstract": "While β-lactam antibiotics are a critical part of the antimicrobial arsenal, they are frequently compromised by various resistance mechanisms, including changes in penicillin binding proteins of the bacterial cell wall. Genetic deletion of the penicillin binding protein and serine/threonine kinase-associated protein (PASTA) kinase in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been shown to restore β-lactam susceptibility. However, the mechanism remains unclear, and whether pharmacologic inhibition would have the same effect is unknown. In this study, we found that deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the PASTA kinase in Listeria monocytogenes by the nonselective kinase inhibitor staurosporine results in enhanced susceptibility to both aminopenicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. Resistance to vancomycin, another class of cell wall synthesis inhibitors, or antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis was unaffected by staurosporine treatment. Phosphorylation assays with purified kinases revealed that staurosporine selectively inhibited the PASTA kinase of L. monocytogenes (PrkA). Importantly, staurosporine did not inhibit a L. monocytogenes kinase without a PASTA domain (Lmo0618) or the PASTA kinase from MRSA (Stk1). Finally, inhibition of PrkA with a more selective kinase inhibitor, AZD5438, similarly led to sensitization of L. monocytogenes to β-lactam antibiotics. Overall, these results suggest that pharmacologic targeting of PASTA kinases can increase the efficacy of β-lactam antibiotics.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared soy germ pasta with conventional pasta for effects on gastric emptying. Patients (n = 10) with delayed gastric emptying consumed one serving per day of each pasta for 8 weeks, with a 4-week washout. Gastric emptying time (t1/2) was measured using the [(13)C]octanoic acid breath test at baseline and after each period, and blood glucose and insulin concentrations were determined after oral glucose load. RESULTS: Soy germ pasta significantly accelerated the t1/2 in these patients (161.2 ± 17.5 min at baseline vs. 112.6 ± 11.2 min after treatment, P = 0.009). Such change differed significantly (P = 0.009) from that for conventional pasta (153.6 ± 24.2 vs. 156.2 ± 27.4 min), without affecting glucose or insulin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that soy germ pasta may offer a simple dietary approach to managing diabetic gastropathy.",

This protective effect may occur by affecting the release of a number of gut peptides involved in the control of gastrointestinal motility. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of inulin-enriched pasta on the circulating levels of neurotensin (NT), somatostatin (SS), and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in relation to the GE time in young healthy subjects. METHODS: Twenty healthy young male volunteers completed a randomized double-blind crossover study consisting of a 2-week run-in period and two 5-week study periods (11% inulin-enriched/control pasta), with an 8-week wash-out period in between. Gut peptide concentrations were evaluated by radioimmunoassay. GE time was evaluated by ultrasonography. RESULTS: The prebiotic treatment significantly increased the area under the curve (AUC) values of both NT and SS (p < 0.05 Dunn's post-test). With regard to gastric motility, along with a significant delay in both the final time and T (1/2) gastric emptying time, a positive correlation was found between T (1/2) and SS AUC values (r = 0.57, p = 0.009) in the inulin-enriched pasta group. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that inulin plays an active role in mechanisms affecting the release of these gut peptides, which may modulate the gastric emptying of digesta.",

      "abstract": "Different lines of evidence suggest that higher intake of fiber may somehow protect against metabolic syndrome. The prebiotic inulin has widely been studied in relation to its putative beneficial effects on lipid and glucose metabolism. Therefore, adding inulin to diet may be a suitable strategy to prevent metabolic syndrome. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the daily consumption of inulin-enriched pasta on lipid and glucose metabolism as well as on gastrointestinal motility in young healthy subjects. Methods. Twenty-two healthy young male volunteers entered a randomized double blind cross-over study consisting of a 2-weeks a run-in period, two 5-weeks study periods (11% inulin-enriched or control pasta), and an 8-weeks wash-out period in between. Serum lipid and glucose concentrations were evaluated by routine biochemical analyses. Gastric emptying time and electrical activity were non-invasively evaluated by ultrasound and electrogastrography. Data were analyzed by Friedman Repeated Measures ANOVA test. Results. Significant differences among baseline and the treatment group were found for HDL-cholesterol (p=0.004), total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio (p=0.006), triglycerides (p=0.04), fasting glucose level (p=0.044), fructosamine (p=0.0478), HbA1c (p=0.04), and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) (p=0.045). The gastric emptying, expressed as final emptying time, was found significantly delayed in the group that assumed inulin-enriched pasta (p=0.008). Conclusions. Inulin-enriched pasta improved lipidic and glicidic metabolism as well as the insulin resistance in healthy young subjects. In addition, it delayed the gastric emptying time which may represent the physiological counterpart of its metabolic effects.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: PASTA (pacing of the atria in sinus node disease) is a prospective and randomized trial, assessing the effect of different atrial lead positions on the atrial fibrillation (AF) incidence in patients with sinus node disease (SND). METHOD: The atrial lead position is randomized to: (a) free right atrial wall, (b) right atrial appendage (RAA), (c) coronary sinus ostium (CS-Os), or (d) dual site right atrial pacing (CS-Os + RAA). The pacemakers (Vitatron Selection 9000 or Prevent AF, Vitatron B.V., Arnhem, The Netherlands) are programmed in DDDR 70 mode and the total follow-up duration is 24 months. To describe the atrial rhythm state, pacemaker-derived data (arrhythmia counter) were assessed for AF episodes. AF was considered as evident, if the AF burden (time in AF related to follow-up interval) was >1% (i.e., 15 min/d). Follow-up data after 24 months were evaluated. RESULTS: The analysis evaluates 142 patients (77 male, 74.5 +/- 7.8 years). There was no statistical significant difference with respect to the occurrence of AF between the four groups after 24 months (A: 36%; B: 38%, C: 32%, D: 48%). The percentage of atrial/ventricular pacing was in A: 78/76%, in B: 84/81%, in C: 70/65%, and in D: 79/69%. These differences were not significant. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of the AF burden >1% and the total AF burden after 24 months did not show differences in the incidence of AF in patients with dual chamber pacemaker therapy for SND. We were not able to demonstrate a significant influence of right atrial lead position on the incidence of AF recurrence.",

Using a pre-post design, the two groups were compared in terms of illness knowledge, mental health and self-efficacy. RESULTS: Analysis of the results showed a significant increase in knowledge of anxiety among participants of the psychoeducational group (d = 0.80). The effect sizes from 0.12 - 0.60 indicate clinical relevant improvement in depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a tendency towards improved self-efficacy (d = 0.20).

Few data are available about the effects of inulin on Lipoprotein(a), a low-density lipoprotein-like particle considered as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. Adding inulin to pasta could be a preventive strategy for delaying the onset of atherosclerosis. AIM OF THE STUDY: was to evaluate the effects of inulin-enriched pasta on lipid profile and on Lipoprotein(a) in young healthy subjects. METHODS: Twenty-two young healthy male volunteers entered a randomized double blind cross-over study consisting of a 2-weeks run-in period, a baseline assessment, two 5-weeks study periods (11% inulin-enriched or control pasta), and an 8-weeks wash-out period in between. Serum lipid concentrations were evaluated by routine biochemical analyses and plasma Lipoprotein(a) concentrations by ELISA. The size of apolipoprotein(a) isoforms was determined by Western blot and immunodetection. RESULTS: Significant differences at baseline and in the treatment groups were found for HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.004), total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio (P = 0.006), triglycerides (P = 0.04), and Lipoprotein(a) (P = 0.02) concentrations (data analyzed by Friedman test). Dunn's multiple comparison test was used to assess the significance of differences between inulin-enriched pasta diet vs. baseline. HDL-cholesterol concentrations increased by 35.9%; total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, and Lipoprotein(a) concentrations decreased by 22.2, 23.4, and 16.5% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin-enriched pasta administration induced significant effects on lipid pattern parameters in young healthy volunteers, including a significant reduction in Lipoprotein(a) concentrations.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Napkin dermatitis or diaper dermatitis is one of the most frequent cutaneous disease in the pediatric age. The most common type of napkin dermatitis is the irritant contact form, which is frequently complicated by an overinfection with bacteria or Candida albicans. METHODS: In this paper, 25 children (7 males and 18 females), aged between 1 month and 4 years and affected by napkin dermatitis, were treated with a barrier cream containing zinc oxide, vitamin E, panthenol (NoAll Bimbi Pasta Trattante, PSN Rottapharm, Milan, Italy). In 20 patients, a diagnosis of irritant contact diaper dermatitis was made, 3 patients suffered from atopic dermatitis, 1 patient was affected by psoriasis and 1 patient presented to a perianal streptococcal dermatitis. A candidal overinfection was diagnosed in 12 patients and was treated with a topical antifungal agent, applied twice daily for 2 weeks. NoAll Bimbi Pasta Trattante was applied at every diaper change. In all cases, we considered 2 subjective symptoms (burning and itching), and 3 objective parameters (erythema, oedema, exudation/vesiculation), at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: One patient withdrew the study. In 13 patients clinical healing was observed, 9 patients showed marked improvement, in 2 patients we did not observe improvement. Tolerability was considered excellent in 13 patients, good in 9 and sufficient in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained demonstrated that NoAll Bimbi Pasta Trattante, applied at every change of the napkin, is very effective and well tolerated in the treatment of irritant diaper dermatitis. Moreover, NoAll Bimbi Pasta Trattante, applied in association with other pharmacological treatments, may accelerate healing in case of overinfection due to Candida albicans and in case of inflammatory dermatoses localized in the gluteo-perineal area.",

      "abstract": "L-dopa therapy reverses some but not all of the motor deficits in human Parkinson patients. Although a number rat analogues of human Parkinson's disease have been developed for evaluating the efficacy of drug therapies, it is not known whether L-dopa has a similar selective action on the motor symptoms in the rat models. To examine the effectiveness of L-dopa in reversing the motor deficits in rats, we administered 6-OHDA unilaterally to produce hemi-Parkinson rats, which were then trained to reach for food using either their impaired (contralateral to the lesion) limb or their good (ipsilateral to the lesion) limb. To assess the skill, accuracy and range of limb movement, rats reached for pasta from a horizontal array of 260 vertically orientated pieces of pasta. The number and location of pasta pieces taken from this matrix was calculated and the qualitative aspects of the reaching movements were rated. The quantitative data on pasta sticks retrieved indicated that forelimb extension and movement radius around the shoulder joint was reduced by 6-OHDA treatment and did not improve after chronic L-dopa treatment. The qualitative analysis showed that grasping patterns, paw movements and body movements impaired by the lesion were also not improved by L-dopa treatment. These findings are the first in the rat to suggest that whereas L-dopa has a general activating effect on the rat's whole-body movements, as displayed in contralateral rotation, its effectiveness does not extend to skilled forelimb movements. The results are discussed in relationship to the idea that the restoration of some skilled movements may require normal synaptic function.",

      "abstract": "Monsanto's \"Lasagna\" process uses layers of treatment zones spaced between buried electrodes to remove trichloroethylene (TCE) from contaminated soil and groundwater. TCE is used primarily as a metal degreaser as well as in products such as dyes, printing ink, and paint. TCE can eventually make its way into the environment and is prevalent in the water and soil of industrialized nations. Although TCE breaks down in a few days when released into the atmosphere, it degrades much more slowly in soil, taking months or years. Moreover, it is often broken down by microbes into toxic substances such as vinylidene chloride (a suspected human carcinogen) and vinyl chloride (a known human carcinogen). The Lasagna process is based on the principle of electro-osmosis, in which an electric current draws water from low--permeability soils such as clays, silts, and fine sands. To remove TCE from contaminated soils, Monsanto scientists added layers of filtering media, which attack the contaminant as it is pulled from electrode to electrode. The technology has been tested at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in western Kentucky, where it removed over 98% of TCE from contaminated soil.",

      "abstract": "The microbial population present in 49 samples of Italian industrially processed filled pasta was characterized and its changes during refrigerated storage were evaluated. The most frequently isolated species belonged to the genus Bacillus. No pathogenic organisms were isolated from the processed industrial pasta. As a consequence of the diversity of composition and thermal treatment a wide variability was observed (from less than 3 days to more than 1 month) in the shelf life at 4 degrees C of the industrial \"fresh filled pasta.\" However, the results obtained suggested that the shelf life of the processed products depend not only on the number of surviving cells but also on the textural or microstructural changes induced by the heat treatment. Challenge tests using Staphylococcus aureus showed that even pasteurization values (P 70(10), expressed as an equivalent process time, in minutes, necessary to obtain at 70 degrees C the same lethal effect as during the actual process) not exceeding 2 were able to remarkably reduce the cell load of this organism. Subsequent growth of the surviving S. aureus cells occurred only at temperatures > 7 degrees C, particularly when the water activity (aw) values were higher than 0.97.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate whether acute and chronic metformin administration may influence differently the glycaemic and insulin response to foods with high and low glycaemic index (bread and pasta) in twelve non-insulin dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients. Thirty minutes after a random oral administration of either a placebo or a single 850 mg metformin dose, glycaemic and insulin responses to 90 g white bread or 68 g pasta (corresponding to 50 g carbohydrates) were evaluated within 4 h. All the patients were subsequently treated with metformin (850 mg twice a day) for a month and then glycaemic and insulin responses were evaluated again. The acute administration of metformin lowered glycaemic response to bread at 60 and 90 min (P < 0.02 and P < 0.05, respectively) but not to pasta, without affecting insulin response. Chronic metformin treatment significantly lowered glycaemic and insulin response to both bread and pasta. In conclusion, an acute antihyperglycaemic effect of metformin was demonstrable only when a food with high glycaemic index, such as bread, was eaten. On the contrary, the effect of chronic treatment was always present, independent from the glycaemic index of foods, together with a reduction in insulin response, indicating an enhanced sensitivity to endogenous insulin.",

We investigate numerically the time evolution of orbits with initial energy in some few low-frequency linear modes. Our results indicate a transition where, above a critical energy which is independent of N, one can reach equipartition if one waits for a time proportional to N(2). Below this critical energy the time to equipartition is exponentially long. We develop a theory to determine the time evolution and the excitation of the nonlinear modes based on a resonant normal form treatment of the resonances among the oscillators. Our theory predicts the critical energy for equipartition, the time scale to equipartition, and the form of the nonlinear modes below equipartition, in qualitative agreement with the numerical results.

Acute experiments (A, B) were carried out in healthy volunteers and in diabetics, by evaluating plasma glucose, triglyceride and insulin changes after a single meal. Plasma glucose and triglyceride rises were almost completely prevented by the pasta in normal volunteers; plasma insulin levels were modified to a lesser extent. In diabetics, the rise of plasma glucose after the meal was significantly delayed. The pasta was also administered for more prolonged periods of time to diabetic and hyperlipidemic patients (experiments C-E). In the first instance, a significant improvement both in the plasma glucose levels, as well as in the daily glucose profile and glycosuria was observed. In hyperlipidemics, a reduction of triglyceride levels was particularly evident; however, in mixed types of hyperlipidemias, a significant hypocholesterolemic effect was also demonstrated. Guar gum pasta may provide a simple dietary addition for the management of common metabolic disorders.",
