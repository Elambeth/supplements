      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dandruff is a widespread scalp issue that affects many people worldwide, often causing itching and discomfort. It is linked to the presence of certain microorganisms on the scalp, especially Malassezia yeast, which interacts with skin cells to trigger dandruff. This condition can lead patients to experience health concerns and social or emotional distress. Common treatments include antifungal shampoos. Neem leaves have been selected for their natural ability to fight germs, reduce inflammation, and support immune health. They contain beneficial compounds that help treat infections, aid healing, and have long been used in traditional medicine as a natural remedy. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of neem leaf paste in treating scalp dandruff among female students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quasi-experimental pre-test post-test control group study was conducted on female students aged 18-24 with minimal, moderate, and severe dandruff levels. The modified Van Abbe's scale was used to assess the dandruff level. A total of 100 female students were selected using non-probability purposive sampling with no history of allergy to neem leaf formulations. The primary objective was to reduce the dandruff score. The dandruff levels were assessed before and after the application of neem leaf paste at baseline, Week 1, and Week 2. Statistical analysis was performed using frequency and percentage for demographic variables, and a t-test was used to compare dandruff levels between the control and experimental groups. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The study included 50 female students in the experimental group and 50 in the control group. Before applying neem leaf paste, 66% (n=33) in the experimental group and 60% (n=30) in the control group had a moderate level of dandruff, while 10% (n=5) and 14% (n=7) in the respective groups had severe dandruff. After the intervention, 44% (n=22) in the experimental group had no dandruff, compared to just 4% (n=2) in the control group. Additionally, 42% (n=21) in the experimental group had a minimal level of dandruff, whereas 28% (14 participants) in the control group had the same. Only 14% (n=7) in the experimental group still had moderate dandruff, compared to 60% (n=30) in the control group. The control group also had 8% (n=4) with severe dandruff, while none remained at this level in the experimental group. After one week, the mean dandruff score significantly dropped to 0.7 in the experimental group, compared to 1.72 in the control group (p-value = 0.00001), indicating a statistically significant reduction in dandruff severity due to neem leaf paste application. CONCLUSION: The application of neem leaf paste was effective in managing dandruff among the participants. Neem leaf paste, known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, offers a cost-effective and natural alternative for managing dandruff. Its effectiveness in reducing dandruff levels among study participants highlights its potential as a safe and accessible treatment option."

      "abstract": "This study assessed the cardioprotective effects of <1 kDa peptide fractions from neem seed protein hydrolysates (NSPHs) in cardiac tissues ex vivo. Oxidative injury was induced in cardiac tissues from male Wister rats by incubating with 0.1 mM FeSO4 (pro-oxidant) for 30 minutes. Untreated tissues lacked peptide fractions, while normal control tissues lacked peptide and pro-oxidant. Treatment with the peptides increased the activities/levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase, ENTPDase, 5'NTPDase, glutathione, and HDL-cholesterol. Conversely, the levels/activities of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, ACE, acetylcholinesterase, ATPase decreased following treatment with NSPH peptide fractions. Furthermore, the peptides depleted oxidative metabolites, while concomitantly inactivating plasmalogen synthesis and beta-oxidation of long-chain saturated fatty acids. These findings suggest that <1 kDa peptide fractions from neem seed protein hydrolysates have cardioprotective properties, potentially offering a natural therapeutic option for managing oxidative cardiac dysfunction through the regulation of oxidative stress, cholinesterase and purinergic activities, and lipid metabolism."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Hesperidin (HSP) is a potent phytochemical antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that protects against otitis media. However, due to its low solubility and bioavailability, a suitable delivery method is needed to overcome these problems. A hydrogel is a promising nanocarrier for controlled drug delivery in response to external stimuli, such as pH variations. Methods: Graphene oxide (GO)-based nanocarriers that encapsulate hesperidin (HSP) were further coated with a polylactic-co-glycolic acid/alginate (PLGA-Alg) hydrogel before being integrated into a green neem oil (N.O.) double emulsion to produce a synergistic effect and then characterized by different assays. Results: The nanocarriers exhibited a substantial particle size (168 ± 0.32 nm), with high encapsulation (89.86 ± 0.23%) and a zeta potential of 37 ± 0.43 mV. In vitro release studies conducted over 96 h indicated a sustained HSP release of 82% at pH 5.4 and 65% at pH 7.4. The GO-HSP-loaded neem oil double emulsion formulation exhibits substantial antibacterial activity, as evidenced by inhibition zones of 39 ± 0.02 mm against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and considerable antifungal activity against Candida albicans, with an inhibition zone of 43 ± 0.13 mm, along with biofilm inhibition activity. The formulation demonstrated antioxidant activity (5.21 µg/mL) and increased cell viability (90-95%) while maintaining low cytotoxicity in HSE-2 cells. A histopathological analysis confirmed that treatment with the nanocarriers reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, TLR4, IL-6) and raised the levels of antioxidant markers (Nrf-2, SOD) in an in vivo rat model of otitis media. Conclusions: GO-based nanocarriers integrated into a neem oil double emulsion and coated with PLGA-Alg hydrogel deliver hesperidin with sustained release and enhanced antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties. This formulation may be used to treat otitis media and other oxidative stress diseases."

Many dye adsorbents report secondary waste generation, non-biodegradability, high costs and energy. Therefore, in this work, Neem gum (Ng) is utilised as a propitious candidate for water treatment due to its tuneable chemical structure, renewability, biodegradability, sustainability, non-toxicity and low cost. The Ng-g-p(AA)-cl-MBA hydrogel is synthesised via a free-radical polymerization technique to find its efficacy towards the adsorption of cationic dyes rhodamine B(RhB) and methylene blue(MB) and systematically characterized using FT-IR, TGA, XRD, BET and FE-SEM analysis. Various parameters were optimized for achieving the maximum adsorption efficiency including the initial concentration, pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage, and contact time. Adsorption Isotherm, Kinetics and Thermodynamics were studied to understand the adsorption behaviour of Ng-g-p(AA)-cl-MBA towards the dyes. The adsorption behaviour was best simulated by Langmuir's model with a maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) of 552.49 and 421.94 mg/g towards RhB and MB respectively, it obeyed a pseudo-second-order rate of adsorption and followed an exothermic and spontaneous process. It also depicted good regeneration and reusability features making it a promising candidate for dye effluent adsorption."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The existing anticancer drugs in clinical practice show poor efficacy in cervical cancer patients and are associated with multiple side effects. Our previous study demonstrated the strong antineoplastic activity of crude extract prepared from the stem bark of Azadirachta indica (Neem) against cervical cancer. However, the active phytoconstituents of neem stem bark extract and its underlying anticancer mechanism are yet to be investigated. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the active fraction from crude neem stem bark extract to further dissect its anticancer mechanism and determine the active components. METHODS: Dichloromethane (DCM) extract from neem stem bark was prepared and fractionated using thin-layer chromatography. The fractions obtained were screened against HeLa and ME-180 cervical cancer cell lines to identify the most active fraction, which was then selected for further studies. Clonogenic assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay were performed to determine the cytotoxicity of the active fraction. Gene expression was analyzed using real-time PCR and western blot to determine the mechanism. Additionally, the HeLa cells-derived 3D spheroid model was used to determine the antitumor efficacy of the active fraction. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance were used to identify the phytoconstituents of the fraction. RESULTS: Initial screening revealed fraction 2 (F2) as the most active fraction. Additionally, F2 showed the least cytotoxic effect on normal human fibroblast cells. Mechanistically, F2 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. F2 increased ROS levels, induced ER stress, and activated cell survival pathway. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine revealed that F2 induced ROS-independent ER stress and apoptosis. 3D spheroid viability and growth delay experiments demonstrated the strong antitumor potential of F2. Finally, six compounds, including one flavonoid (nicotiflorin) and five limonoids, were identified in the F2 fraction. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to identify the active fraction and its phytoconstituents from neem stem bark and demonstrate the anticancer mechanism against cervical cancer. Our study highlights the importance of investigating neem stem bark-derived limonoids and nicotiflorin as a potential source to develop new anticancer therapeutic agents.",

      "abstract": "Acute hepatitis, characterized by rapid onset and high mortality, can result from infections, toxins, and other factors. However, current treatment options have significant side effects, necessitating further research into alternative therapies. This study investigated the extraction method of neem extract and found that its ethanolic extract effectively reduced mortality and decreased ALT and AST levels in mice serum, improving liver pathology. HPLC analysis identified azadirachtin and nimbolide in the extract. It also downregulated NF-κB, NLRP3, and p62 levels, while upregulating Lc3B and Atg5 levels. Experiments in Atg5 knockout mice showed that the absence of Atg5 weakened the extract's efficacy in reducing liver damage and inflammation and affected the extent of NLRP3 protein downregulation. However, it did not affect the extract's ability to reduce NF-κB. Overall, the ethanolic extract of neem leaves primarily modulates the inflammatory response through the NF-κB signaling pathway. The extract's efficacy in reducing NLRP3 is associated with autophagy. These discoveries offer a new theoretical basis for the role of neem in treating acute hepatitis.",

Aphids were given both residual and direct treatments, i.e. exposed to residues applied by leaf dipping, or by spraying the insects and foliage, while the predator was treated directly with insecticides. Well-established spirotetramat (Movento® 240 SC) was used as standard due to its effectiveness against a wide range of pests, its unique mode of action, and its systemic properties. All insecticides were effective against aphid mostly in concentration-dependent manner, as do exposure time, but at different magnitudes. Spirotetramat and Azatrol induced the highest toxicity to adult aphids, while spirotetramat and Molt-X were more noxious to aphid nymphs. C. subtsugae and Burkholderia were less effective, inducing only moderate levels of aphid mortality. Azatrol and spirotetramat were more detrimental to the fecundity of aphid compared to other products. Insecticides significantly increased the development time of nymphs surviving exposure to insecticides, except Burkholderia. Azatrol were more destructive to eggs, larvae and adult of Coccinella septempunctata, together with spirotetramat for young larvae and adults, relative to other treatment. The development time of predator larvae remained unaffected by treatment. New Betaproteobacteria- and neem-based insecticides except Azatrol seem to be a promising tool to suppress population of Aphis gossypii and integrate pest management programmes."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  One hundred twenty-eight (N = 128) type IV dental cast stone specimens were prepared, and biofilms of microorganisms were cultured. Dental stone samples were subjected to disinfection protocols, including 0.5% chlorhexidine (CHX), 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 20% neem extract, and microwave irradiation for 1 to 5 minutes. Colony forming unit (CFU) counts and scanning electron microscopy were utilized to witness changes in the biofilm, pre- and postdisinfection/sterilization. RESULTS:  For P. aeruginosa, significant (p < 0.05) decrease in CFU counts after 1 minute (from 233 to -215) and 2, 3, and 5 minutes (from 233 to -233) were observed after CHX treatment. After microwave radiation, a significant decrease in CFU counts was also observed after 1 minute (from 233 to -130.3), 2 minutes (from 233 to -229), and 3 and 5 minutes (from 233 to -233). For S. mutans, a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in CFU counts was observed after 1, 2, 3, and 5 minutes (from 212 to -268) after NaOCl treatment and microwave radiation (from 212 to -271 after 1 minute and from 212 to -274.3 after 2, 3, and 5 minutes). For C. albicans, significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the CFU counts (1-5 minutes) was observed after CHX exposure, while NaOCl and microwave radiation demonstrated equal disinfection potency. Neem extract was effective to disinfect the dental stone; however, it was not as potent as the other disinfectants and microwave radiation. CONCLUSION:  It was observed that exposure to CHX, NaOCl, and microwave radiation significantly reduced the microbial CFU counts. Although the use of neem extract also significantly reduced these CFU counts, this reduction was not as much as the other three tested materials. Further research exploring other chemical disinfectants with various concentrations is recommended."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Brain malaria, which results from Plasmodium falciparum infection, is responsible for substantial fatalities and health issues. These processes, including cytoadherence, rosetting, and sequestration, induce an immune response, hypoxia, brain microvascular obstruction, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and cell death. Parasitemia level can reveal the presence of infection and its association with apoptosis-related genes. Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves with antimalarial properties could replace ineffective Indonesian malaria medications. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of neem leaf extract on cerebral malaria-induced parasitemia and neuron cell apoptosis in mice through an in vivo approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 13-16 weeks old C57BL mice received infection by Plasmodium berghei strain ANKA. Parasitemia was estimated daily from the mice's tail blood. 8 mg, 12 mg, and 16 mg of a 96% ethanolic neem leaf extract were orally given for 6 days. Healthy, positive, and negative controls were included for treatment comparisons. On the 7th day, brain tissue was analyzed for (p > 0.05) gene expression. Through immunohistochemistry, both cell apoptosis in neurons expressing caspase-3 within a brain sample and the degree of parasitemia in a blood smear were assessed. The Pearson correlation test and one-way analysis of variance were employed to analyze the data. RESULTS: Neem leaf extract reduces parasitemia and neuron cell apoptosis at multiple dosages (p < 0.000). Apoptosis in brain neurons and parasitemia show a strong positive correlation (r = +0.939). Neem leaf extract at doses of 12 and 16 mg was the most effective in reducing parasitemia levels and causing cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Neem leaf therapy significantly reduced the degree of parasitemia and cell apoptosis in C57BL mice compared with the control group without treatment (p = 0.05). This shows that neem leaves have the potential to be a candidate drug for malaria."

Broilers in group 1 (G1) were infected with only C. psittaci, broilers in group 2 (G2) were infected with only LPAIV H9N2, broilers in group 3 (G3) were infected with C. psittaci and LPAIV H9N2, and broilers in group 4 (G4) remained not challenged and non-treated with any therapeutic or preventive treatment (negative control). At 21 d postinfection (dpi), birds in G1, G2, and G3 were divided into 3 subgroups of 10 birds each: subgroup (A) remained infected and untreated (positive control), subgroup (B) infected and received oxytetracycline for 5 consecutive d, and subgroup (C) infected and received 8% aqueous neem leaf extract for 5 consecutive d. The multiplication of C. psittaci in birds in G1, in various tissues was evaluated using Giemsa staining and the data showed that multiplication was much higher in the lung, spleen, and liver from 6 h to 21 dpi, but low in the heart from 8 to 21 dpi. During simultaneous co-infection in G3, the birds developed significant clinical symptoms and postmortem lesions (PM). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect viral shedding from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs between 2 dpi and 8 dpi, with cycle threshold (CT) values ranging from 22 to 24. In contrast, bacterial shedding began 6 h after infection and continued until 21 dpi, with CT values ranging from 23 to 26. Administration of an aqueous neem leaf extract at an 8% concentration (Group C) resulted in a numerical rise in average body weight across all treatment groups in the third and fourth week, as well as a reduction in LPAIV H9N2 and C. psittaci replication in the respiratory and gut of treated birds compared to those treated with oxytetracycline (Group B). Overall, respiratory co-infections pose a considerable risk to the poultry business, which is a big threat. To control C. psittaci and LPAIV H9N2 in broiler chickens, oral supplementation of 8% aqueous neem leaf extract is recommended. This treatment improves the birds' performance, as evidenced by an increase in their average body weight. In addition, the application of 8% aqueous neem leaf extract lowers C. psittaci replication within tissues and diminishes LPAIV H9N2 shedding.",

      "abstract": "The need to transition to more sustainable agriculture that is adaptable to environmental challenges, reducing dependence on chemical fertilizers and minimizing environmental impact, represents the new paradigm of the moment. In this scenario, studies with the adoption of bioinputs in corn cultivation emerge as a viable option for the sustainability of agricultural activity. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate the effect of doses of neem vegetable cake on the yield components of corn crops. An experimental design was used of randomized blocks was used, consisting of four doses of neem vegetable rendering (3 kg ha-1, 6 kg ha-1, 9 kg ha-1 and 12 kg ha-1) and a treatment control without the presence of organic fertilizer. The result indicates the presence of a significant effect of treatments with the application of neem cake on the main components of corn yield, including grain productivity, suggesting that the high carbon content present in the organic product can induce phytochemical effects and biological changes. in the soil, making it more productive. It was found that, when administering the maximum experimental dose, compared to the control group, there was a significant effect (p≤0.01) of 21.3% on grain productivity, jumping from 2,140 kg ha -1, when did not apply organic fertilizer, to 2,596 kg ha-1 with the application of 12 kg of neem cake per hectare. It is noted that the increase in grain productivity was in the proportion of 38 kg ha-1 of corn for each kilo of neem cake applied. To facilitate interpretation and decision-making, an analysis of the economic viability of neem cake for rainfed corn was also determined, also identifying the maximum experimental dose of 12 kg ha-1, as the most economically viable, providing an increase in profit of around R$ 119.92 per hectare, in relation to the control.",

      "abstract": "Targeting exhausted CD8+ T-cell (TEX)-induced aggravated cancer stem cells (CSC) holds immense therapeutic potential. In this regard, immunomodulation via Neem Leaf Glycoprotein (NLGP), a plant-derived glycoprotein immunomodulator is explored. Since former reports have proven immune dependent-tumor restriction of NLGP across multiple tumor models, we hypothesized that NLGP might reprogram and rectify TEX to target CSCs successfully. In this study, we report that NLGP's therapeutic administration significantly reduced TEX-associated CSC virulence in in vivo B16-F10 melanoma tumor model. A similar trend was observed in in vitro generated TEX and B16-F10/MCF7 coculture setups. NLGP rewired CSCs by downregulating clonogenicity, multidrug resistance phenotypes and PDL1, OCT4, and SOX2 expression. Cell cycle analysis revealed that NLGP educated-TEX efficiently pushed CSCs out of quiescent phase (G0G1) into synthesis phase (S), supported by hyper-phosphorylation of G0G1-S transitory cyclins and Rb proteins. This rendered quiescent CSCs susceptible to S-phase-targeting chemotherapeutic drugs like 5-fluorouracil (5FU). Consequently, combinatorial treatment of NLGP and 5FU brought optimal CSC-targeting efficiency with an increase in apoptotic bodies and proapoptotic BID expression. Notably a strong nephron-protective effect of NLGP was also observed, which prevented 5FU-associated toxicity. Furthermore, Dectin-1-mediated NLGP uptake and subsequent alteration of Notch1 and mTOR axis were deciphered as the involved signaling network. This observation unveiled Dectin-1 as a potent immunotherapeutic drug target to counter T-cell exhaustion. Cumulatively, NLGP immunotherapy alleviated exhausted CD8+ T-cell-induced CSC aggravation. Implications: Our study recommends that NLGP immunotherapy can be utilized to counter ramifications of T-cell exhaustion and to target therapy elusive aggressive CSCs without evoking toxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of avian coccidiosis in the poultry industry has grown, resulting in substantial financial losses from high mortality, stunted growth, reduced productivity, and expensive medical expenses. AIM: The purpose of the current study was to assess the immunological effects of neem leaf extract and toltrazuril on broilers that had contracted coccidiosis. METHODS: In this investigation, 100 one-day-old Cobb broiler chicks without sexes were employed. The chicks were divided into five equal groups, with 20 birds in each. On the 14th day of life, the birds in groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 received an oral inoculation with 1 × 105 sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella (E. tenella) (field isolate). The first group (Gp), which consists of 20 healthy broilers, served as a negative control. Gp (2) contains experimentally infected broilers and nontreated (served as a positive control). Gp (3) contains experimentally infected broilers treated with toltrazuril (1 ml/l drinking water) for two consecutive days. Gp (4) contains experimentally infected broilers treated with neem leaf extract 4% (50 ml/l drinking water) for 5 successive days, and Gp (5) contains experimentally infected broilers treated with toltrazuril (1 ml/l drinking water) and a half dose of neem leaves extract 4% (25 ml/l drinking water) for 5 successive days. For the purpose of estimating body weight growth and feed conversion ratio, each broiler was weighed separately at the start of the trial and again on the 1st and 10th day after treatment. In addition to obtaining intestinal samples for immunohistochemistry, blood samples were also obtained for immunological examination. RESULTS: As compared to the negative control group, the experimentally infested broilers with E. tenella showed significant decreases in serum nitric oxide, lysosome, phagocytic percent, and phagocytic index, along with significant increases in white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocyte, heterophilis, eosinophilis, basophilis, monocyte, serum total protein, γ globulin, fibrinogen, and haptoglobin. When compared to the control positive group, experimentally infested broilers treated with either neem or toltrazuril alone or in combination demonstrated significant increases in serum total protein, nitric oxide, lysozyme, phagocytic percent, and phagocytic index, but significant decreases in WBCs, lymphocytes, heterophile, eosinophile, basophile, and monocyte. The intestinal peroxidase stain of broilers infected with E. tenella exhibited a significant positive expression for CD4, but the infected broilers treated with toltrazuril and half a dosage of neem displayed a negative expression for CD4, identical to the negative control. CONCLUSION: The broiler chickens infested with E. tenella may have a variety of negative impacts on their immune systems and immunohistopathological findings. Nonetheless, toltrazuril and neem extract, either separately or in combination, function as anticoccidial medications that may enhance the broiler chicks' immune state.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Murine tumor growth restriction by neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP) was established in various transplanted models of murine sarcoma, melanoma and carcinoma. However, the role of NLGP in the sequential carcinogenic steps has not been explored. Thus, tongue carcinogenesis in Swiss mice was induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), which has close resemblance to human carcinogenesis process. Interventional role of NLGP in initiation-promotion protocol established during 4NQO mediated tongue carcinogenesis in relation to systemic immune alteration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is investigated. METHODS: 4NQO was painted on tongue of Swiss mice every third day at a dose of 25µl of 5mg/ml stock solution. After five consecutive treatment with 4NQO (starting Day7), one group of mice was treated with NLGP (s.c., 25µg/mice/week), keeping a group as PBS control. Mice were sacrificed in different time-intervals to harvest tongues and studied using histology, immunohistochemistry, flow-cytometry and RT-PCR on different immune cells and EMT markers (e-cadherin, vimentin) to elucidate their phenotypic and secretory status. RESULTS: Local administration of 4NQO for consecutive 300 days promotes significant alteration in tongue mucosa including erosion in papillae and migration of malignant epithelial cells to the underlying connective tissue stroma with the formation of cell nests (exophytic-hyperkeratosis with mild dysplasia). Therapeutic NLGP treatment delayed pre-neoplastic changes promoting normalization of mucosa by maintaining normal structure. Flow-cytometric evidences suggest that NLGP treatment upregulated CD8+, IFNγ+, granzyme B+, CD11c+ cells in comparison to 4NQO treated mice with a decrease in Ki67+ and CD4+FoxP3+ cells in NLGP treated cohort. RT-PCR demonstrated a marked reduction of MMP9, IL-6, IL-2, CD31 and an upregulation in CCR5 in tongues from 4NQO+NLGP treated mice in comparison to 4NQO treated group. Moreover, 4NQO mediated changes were associated with reduction of e-cadherin and simultaneous up-regulation of vimentin expression in epithelium that was partially reversed by NLGP. DISCUSSION: Efficacy of NLGP was tested first time in sequential carcinogenesis model and proved effective in delaying the initial progression. NLGP normalizes type 1 immunity including activation of the CD8+T effector functions, reduction of regulatory T cell functions, along with changes in EMT to make the host systemically alert to combat the carcinogenic threat.",

However, limitations exist due to potential side effects and high costs. Therefore, searching for natural, cost-effective solutions for dandruff and hair loss is crucial. Rosemary herb and neem tree, both cultivated in Egypt, possess well-documented anti-inflammatory properties derived from their rich phenolic phytoconstituents. This study formulated a standardized combined extract of rosemary and neem (RN-E 2:1) into hair gel and leave-in tonic formats. This extract demonstrated superior efficacy against Malassezia furfur (a causative agent of dandruff) and Trichophyton rubrum (associated with scalp disorders) compared to the conventional antifungal agent, ketoconazole. The combined extract (RN-E 2:1) also exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity. Additionally, the suppression of iNOS expression is considered concentration-dependent. Quality control verified formulation stability, and ex-vivo studies confirmed effective ingredient penetration into the epidermis, the primary site of fungal presence. Remarkably, both formulations outperformed the standard treatment, minoxidil in hair growth trials. These findings highlight the potential of natural extracts for scalp and hair health.",

OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to investigate whether nimbolide, an anticancer neem limonoid, targets key components of the DDR signalling pathway in cellular and animal models of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). METHODS: OSCC cells (SCC-4 and SCC-9), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcinoma model, chemoresistant OSCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model established in athymic nude mice, and tissue sections from patients with oral premalignant/malignant disease were used for the study. Key molecules that orchestrate the DDR, including the MRN complex, ATM, DNA-PKcs, H2AX, and p53, were analysed by qRTPCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation and apoptosis indices were evaluated. RESULTS: Nimbolide significantly reduced 8-oxodG levels, expression of MRN, ATMS1891, and γ- H2AX, with an increase in p-p53S15 in OSCC cells as well as in the HBP model. Nimbolide potentiated the effect of KU-55933 in ATM inhibition. In the PDX model, nimbolide suppressed tumor formation, stimulated DDR and apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation, and enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin. Analysis of p-ATM expression revealed a significant increase during the sequential progression of hamster and human OSCC. CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence that nimbolide functions as a DDR inhibitor in cellular and hamster OSCC models and as a DDR activator in the PDX model primarily by targeting ATM. Small molecules like nimbolide that modulate DDR are of immense benefit in cancer therapy. The study has also unveiled p-ATM as a promising biomarker of tumour progression in human OSCCs.",

      "abstract": "With their remarkable bioactivity and evolving commercial importance, plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) have gained significant research interest in recent years. Plant tissue culture serves as a credible tool to examine how abiotic stresses modulate the production of PSMs, enabling clear insights into plant stress responses and the prospects for controlled synthesis of bioactive compounds. Azadirachta indica, or neem has been recognized as a repository of secondary metabolites for centuries, particularly for the compound named azadirachtin, due to its bio-pesticidal and high antioxidant properties. Introducing salt stress as an elicitor makes it possible to enhance the synthesis of secondary metabolites, specifically azadirachtin. Thus, in this research, in vitro callus cultures of neem were micro-propagated and induced with salinity stress to explore their effects on the production of azadirachtin and identify potential proteins associated with salinity stress through comparative shotgun proteomics (LCMS/MS). To induce salinity stress, 2-month-old calli were subjected to various concentrations of NaCl (0.05-1.5%) for 4 weeks. The results showed that the callus cultures were able to adapt and survive in the salinity treatments, but displayed a reduction in fresh weight as the NaCl concentration increased. Notably, azadirachtin production was significantly enhanced in the salinity treatment compared to control, where 1.5% NaCl-treated calli produced the highest azadirachtin amount (10.847 ± 0.037 mg/g DW). The proteomics analysis showed that key proteins related to primary metabolism, such as defence, energy, cell structure, redox, transcriptional and photosynthesis, were predominantly differentially regulated (36 upregulated and 93 downregulated). While a few proteins were identified as being regulated in secondary metabolism, they were not directly involved in the synthesis of azadirachtin. In conjunction with azadirachtin elicitation, salinity stress treatment could therefore be successfully applied in commercial settings for the controlled synthesis of azadirachtin and other plant-based compounds. Further complementary omics approaches can be employed to enhance molecular-level modifications, to facilitate large-scale production of bioactive compounds in the future.",

All these methods required highly toxic oxidizing chemicals, high capital investment in membrane/filter materials, and the installation of sophisticated equipment. Wastewater treatment through an adsorption process using biomass-based adsorbent is economical, user-friendly, and sustainable. Neem tree waste has been explored as an adsorbent for wastewater treatment. The chemical components in the neem biomass include carbohydrates, fat, fiber, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which support the functionalization of neem biomass. Moreover, adsorbent preparation from renewable resources is not only cost-effective and environmentally friendly but also helps in waste management for sustainable growth. Contemporary researchers explored the pre- and post-surface-modified neem biomass adsorbents in scavenging the pollutants from contaminated water. This review extensively explores the activation process of neem biomass, physical and chemical methods of surface modification mechanism, and the factors affecting surface modification. The pollutant removal through pre and post-surface-modified neem biomass adsorbents was also summarized. Furthermore, it also provides a comprehensive summary of the factors that affect the adsorption performance of the neem biomass-derived adsorbents against dyes, metal ions, and other emerging pollutants. Understanding the surface-modification mechanisms and the adsorption efficiency factor of adsorbents will help in harnessing their potential for more efficiently combatting environmental pollution and making strides toward a greener and more sustainable future.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Traumatic oral ulcers are one of the most commonly encountered oral ulcers. Their healing may be delayed due to factors like the presence of opportunistic infectious microbes in the oral cavity, secondary trauma from sharp edges of teeth, and the systemic condition of the patient. AIM: To compare the efficacy of a newly developed neem extract containing herbal ointments (propolis and Hemidesmus indicus) in enhancing the wound contraction of traumatic oral ulcers and to determine the relationship between oxidative stress and oral ulcers. METHOD: Ulcers were inflicted by trauma in the mouths of experimental rabbits using a 5 mm punch biopsy device. Forty-eight animals were randomly put into six groups (n = 12). Group 1 was the control group that did not receive any intervention; Group 2 had a systemic treatment of Hemidesmus indicus extract; Group 3 received a topical application of propolis; Group 4 had a topical application of a neem extract-based herbal ointment; Group 5 was administered a combination of Hemidesmus indicus and propolis; and Group 6 had a combination of a neem-based herbal ointment and Hemidesmus indicus. Oxidative stress levels were calculated by measuring superoxide dismutases and malondialdehyde levels in the blood on days 0, one, seven, and 14. Wound contraction scores of ulcers were also assessed on days seven and 14. RESULTS: Significantly higher wound contraction scores were seen in groups treated with herbal ointment in comparison to groups treated without herbal ointment. Oxidative stress levels increased in all groups after the infliction of ulcers (day one) and then declined as the ulcers healed, reaching near-normal levels on day 14. Groups containing Hemidesmus indicus showed a significant reduction in oxidative stress in comparison to groups without Hemidesmus indicus. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. CONCLUSION: A combined formulation of herbal ointment and Hemidesmus indicus proved to be the most efficacious in enhancing wound contraction of oral ulcers along with significantly reducing oxidative stress in experimental rabbits."

      "abstract": "The neem tree, Azadirachta indica, belongs to the Meliaceae family, and its use in the treatment of medical disorders from ancient times to the present in the traditional medical practices of Asia, Africa and the Middle East is well-documented. Neem oil, extracted from the seeds of the fruit, is widely used, with promising medicinal benefits. Azadiradione, a principal antioxidant component of the seeds of A. indica, is known to reduce oxidative stress and has anti-inflammatory effects. To directly measure the antioxidant ability of neem oil, we used Rotating Ring Disk Electrode (RRDE) hydrodynamic voltammetry to quantify how it can scavenge superoxide radical anions. The results of these experiments show that neem oil is approximately 26 times stronger than other natural products, such as olive oil, propolis and black seed oil, which were previously measured using this method. Next, computational Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods were used to arrive at a mechanism for the scavenging of superoxide radical anions with azadiradione. Our work indicates that azadiradione is an effective antioxidant and, according to our DFT study, its scavenging of the superoxide radical anion occurs through a reaction mechanism in which azadiradione mimics the antioxidant action of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In this mechanism, analogous to the SOD enzymatic reaction, azadiradione is regenerated, along with the production of two products: hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. This antioxidant process provides an explanation for azadiradione's more general and protective biochemical effects."

Antibiotics are the main approach against A. hydrophila infections, while the emergence of resistant bacteria limits the application of antibiotics. Here, quorum-sensing (QS) was defined as the target and the inhibitory effects of neem oil against QS of A. hydrophila was studied. The results showed that neem oil could dose-dependently reduce aerolysin, protease, lipase, acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), biofilm and swarming motility at sub-inhibitory concentrations. Results of real-time PCR demonstrated that neem oil could down-regulate the transcription of aerA, ahyI and ahyR. Moreover, neem oil showed significant protections to A549 cells and a fish infection model. Taken together, these results indicated that neem oil could be chosen as a promising candidate for the treatment of A. hydrophila infections.",

      "abstract": "Farming, food processing, animal husbandry and other agro-based activities contribute to global environmental degradation by producing millions of tons of organic and inorganic solid waste. In terms of sustainable agriculture, agricultural waste management and conversion into useful products are essential. In addition, plants are facing various kinds of biotic stress, which ultimately affects their defense system. Altered defense systems in plants ultimately lead to the death of plants and a reduction in crop production. The present study is designed to keep the abovementioned fact in mind, which mainly focuses on the reuse of agricultural waste and its application to the antioxidant potential and structural components of tomato plants during nematode stress. In the present study, neem leaves were collected and mixed with cattle dung for the preparation of vermicompost. Then, tomato seeds were pre-treated with vermicompost extract before being germinated in earthen pots. After germination, they were transplanted to separate pots and inoculated with freshly hatched juveniles of Meloidogyne incognita. The experiments were conducted for 10 days under glass house conditions, and after that, plants were harvested and various physiological (antioxidant capacity, percent electrolyte leakage) and structural markers (carbohydrate content, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) were analyzed. Results revealed that all physico-chemical properties make vermicompost superior as compared to soil and pre-compost material. Further, nematode stress leads to altered physiological and structural markers as compared to uninfected seedlings. However, treatment with vermicompost significantly increases carbohydrate content and antioxidative capacity in a concentration dependent manner. In addition, electrolyte leakage was found to be decrease with an increase in the concentration of vermicompost. All these findings conclude that vermicompost has strong potential to limit the damage caused by nematodes and boost the antioxidant potential of the host plants. Further, this study provides strong evidence for using vermicompost as an eco-friendly alternative to chemical nematicides and a potential strategy for agricultural waste management. This is the first study in which the tomato plant's structural and physiological markers were assessed during nematode stress after being supplemented with vermicompost under glass house conditions for an initial 10 days of nematode exposure."

One hundred thirty birds were randomly divided into 7 groups. Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were divided into 2 subgroups (G1a, G2a, G3a, G4a, G5a, G6a) and (G1b, G2b, G3b, G4b, G5b, G6b) with 10 birds each. Subgroups (G1a, G2a, G3a, G4a, G5a, G6a) received the (bivalent [AI + ND], Re-H5N1, H5N1, H5N3, monovalent AI, monovalent ND) vaccines, while subgroups (G1b, G2b, G3b, G4b, G5b, G6b) received the same previous vaccination but treated with neem leaf extract administrated 2 d before and after vaccination, and G7 with 10 birds was kept unvaccinated as positive control group. Clinical signs of the challenged group showed conjunctivitis, closed eyes, cyanosis in comb and wattle, ocular discharge, and greenish diarrhea, while postmortem lesions showed congested trachea and lung, hemorrhage on the shank, proventriculus, and pancreas; gelatinous fluid submandibular, congestion of all organs (septicemia), mottled spleen. The clinical signs and lesions were mild in neem leaf extract treated with bivalent vaccine and Re-H5N1 while moderate in monovalent vaccine and H5N3 with or without neem leaf extract treated and reached severe in the group immunized with H5N1 with or without neem leaf extract treatment. The protection levels in the bivalent vaccine (AI + ND), Re-5 H5N1, and H5N3 treated with neem leaf extract, were 80%, 80%, and 60%, respectively, while bivalent vaccine (AI + ND), Re-5 H5N1 and H5N3 without treatment were 60%, 60%, and 40%, respectively. The virus shedding was prevented in groups vaccinated with bivalent vaccine and Re-H5N1 vaccine treated with neem leaf extract, while decreased in the group vaccinated with H5N3 with neem leaf extract and Re-H5N1 without neem leaf extract compared with H5N3, H5N1, and monovalent vaccine. The immunological response after vaccination was stronger in the bivalent vaccine group than in the other commercial vaccine groups treated with neem leaf extract, with geometric mean titer (GMTs) of 315.2 and 207.9 at the third and fourth weeks, respectively. The use of immunostimulant antiviral medicinal plants, such as neem, completely protected chicken flocks against HPAI (H5N8) and prevented AI virus shedding, leading us to the conclusion that the use of bivalent vaccines induces a higher immune response than other different commercial vaccines."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Wound healing is the complex physiological process of replacing damaged cells or tissue layers. The neem (Azadirachta Indica) has a variety of biological activities, which may hasten the rate at which the wound healing mechanism occurs. Silk fibroin is a biomaterial that is reported for its tissue regeneration activity. So, the present study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a hydrogel comprising neem and silk fibroin biomaterials for the treatment of wounds. METHODS: Topical neem hydrogels (N-HG) with and without silk fibroin (N-SFB-HG) were prepared using neem extract, silk fibroin, and guar gum, which act by entrapping the components by forming a gel. Evaluation tests such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), visual emergence, pH, rheological behavior, spreading capacity, drug content, skin irritation, anti-microbial action, in vivo wound healing activity, and stability were carried out. RESULTS: The FT-IR results showed no chemical interaction between the constituents. The formed hydrogels had pH values of 5.87 ± 0.3 for N-HG and 5.76 ± 0.2 for N-SFB-HG. The preferred topical gel viscosity was observed in the N-HG (54.2 ± 3.2cPs) and N-SFB-HG (59.9 ± 4.8cPs) formulations. The formulated hydrogels were sterile and did not irritate the skin. The in vivo wound healing investigation results reveal that the N-SF-HG treatment speeds up the regeneration of the injured area faster when compared to control and N-HG treated groups. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: These results support the efficacy of the topical hydrogel formulation, including neem and silk fibroin. Therefore, the neem-silk fibroin hydrogel formulation is a therapeutically viable choice that, following necessary clinical research, might be utilized in novel formulations for managing chronic wounds."

      "abstract": "Finding eco-friendly alternatives for antibiotics in treating bacterial diseases affecting the aquaculture sector is essential. Herbal plants are promising alternatives, especially when combined with nanomaterials. Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves extract was synthesized using a chitosan nanocapsule. Chitosan neem nanocapsule (CNNC) was tested in-vitro and in-vivo against the Aeromonas sobria (A. sobria) challenge in Nile tilapia. A preliminary experiment with 120 Nile tilapia was conducted to determine the therapeutic dose of CNNC, which was established to be 1 mg/L. A treatment study was applied for seven days using 200 fish categorized into four groups (10 fish/replicate: 50 fish/group). The first (control) and second (CNNC) groups were treated with 0 and 1 mg/L CNNC in water without being challenged. The third (A. sobria) and fourth (CNNC + A. sobria) groups were treated with 0 and 1 mg/L CNNC, respectively, and challenged with A. sobria (1 × 107 CFU/mL). Interestingly, CNNC had an in-vitro antibacterial activity against A. sobria; the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of CNNC against A. sobria were 6.25 and 12.5 mg/mL, respectively. A. sobria challenge caused behavioral alterations, skin hemorrhage, fin rot, and reduced survivability (60%). The infected fish suffered a noticeable elevation in the malondialdehyde level and hepato-renal function markers (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine). Moreover, a clear depletion in the level of the antioxidant and immune indicators (catalase, reduced glutathione, lysozymes, nitric oxide, and complement 3) was obvious in the A. sobria group. Treatment of the A. sobria-challenged fish with 1 mg/L CNNC recovered these parameters and enhanced fish survivability. Overall, CNNC can be used as a new versatile tool at 1 mg/L as a water treatment for combating the A. sobria challenge for sustainable aquaculture production."

      "abstract": "Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.), a versatile evergreen tree recognized for its ethnopharmacological value, is a rich source of limonoids of the triterpenoid class, endowed with potent medicinal properties. Extracts of neem have been documented to display anticancer effects in diverse malignant cell lines as well as in preclinical animal models that has largely been attributed to the constituent limonoids. Of late, neem limonoids have become the cynosure of research attention as potential candidate agents for cancer prevention and therapy. Among the various limonoids found in neem, azadirachtin, epoxyazadiradione, gedunin, and nimbolide, have been extensively investigated for anticancer activity. Azadirachtin, a potent biodegradable pesticide, exhibits profound antiproliferative effects by preventing mitotic spindle formation and cell division. The antiproliferative activity of gedunin has been demonstrated to be mediated primarily via inhibition of heat shock protein90 and its client proteins. Epoxyazadiradione inhibits pro-inflammatory and kinase-driven signaling pathways to block tumorigenesis. Nimbolide, the most potent cytotoxic neem limonoid, inhibits the growth of cancer cells by regulating the phosphorylation of keystone kinases that drive oncogenic signaling besides modulating the epigenome. There is overwhelming evidence to indicate that neem limonoids exert anticancer effects by preventing the acquisition of hallmark traits of cancer, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion, inflammation, invasion, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Neem limonoids are value additions to the armamentarium of natural compounds that target aberrant oncogenic signaling to inhibit cancer development and progression.",

The treatments were performed by spraying the insecticide on the goat's body. The study lasted 56 days, and weekly, the kids underwent louse count, BCS and body weight determination, and FAMACHA score. Data were analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measures. The species of lice identified was Linognathus stenopsis. Kids belonging to NO-200 and NO-300 showed a stronger reduction of louse count throughout the study (>95%). The daily weight gain recorded was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in NO-300 than C. No differences were found for BCS and FAMACHA scores. The results of this trial showed that the administration of neem oil to control caprine pediculosis caused by sucking lice represents an alternative to synthetic compounds."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In root canal treatment, chemical debridement of the root canal with the help of irrigants is important due to the complex internal anatomy of the teeth. Biomechanical root canal preparation produces a smear layer. It covers the dentinal tubules, which may interfere with the penetration of various irrigants and intracanal medicaments, so the smear layer has to be removed. The potential side effects and certain limitations of chemical irrigants for smear layer removal have led to a shift toward herbal alternatives. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the smear layer removal efficacy of Neem leaf extract, Propolis, and Orange oil as endodontic irrigants using the scanning electron microscope. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety samples were taken and then randomly (simple random sampling method) divided into three experimental groups (n = 30) depending upon different endodontic irrigants used: Group 1-Neem leaf extract, Group 2-Orange oil and Group 3-Propolis and smear layer removal evaluation was done under the scanning electron microscope Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at all the levels, i.e., coronal, middle, and apical. RESULTS: The collected data were analyzed using the Chi-square test. Group 1 (Neem leaf extract) showed the highest smear layer removal efficacy, which was followed by Group 2 (Orange oil) and the least efficacy of smear layer removal was shown by Group 3 (Propolis) at coronal, middle, and apical levels. CONCLUSION: Group 1 (Neem leaf extract) performed significantly better in removing the smear layer at coronal, middle, and apical levels as compared to the other two groups."

A total of 150 fish (20 ± 2 g) were alienated into five groups (30 fish/group with three replicates). G1 was assigned as a negative control without any treatments. Groups (2-5) were exposed to lead acetate for 2 weeks at a concentration of 5 mg L-1 (G2 and G3) or 10 mg L-1 (G4 and G5). During the lead exposure period, all groups were reared under the same conditions, while G3 and G5 were treated with 1 g L-1 NLP. Lead toxicity induced DNA fragmentation and lipid peroxidation and decreased the level of glutathione and expression of heme synthesis enzyme delta aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D) in wild tilapia, G2, and G4. NLP could alleviate the oxidative stress stimulated by lead in G3 and showed an insignificant effect in G5. The pathological findings, including epithelial hyperplasia in the gills, edema in the gills and muscles, degeneration and necrosis in the liver and muscle, and leukocytic infiltration in all organs, were directly correlated with lead concentration. Thus, the aqueous application of NLP at 1 g L-1 reduced oxidative stress and lowered the pathological alterations induced by lead toxicity.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to employ GC-MS to assess the chemical composition of MeOH leaf extracts of R. officinalis and A. indica and evaluate their insecticidal, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. Twelve components, representing 98.61% and 100% of the total volatile compounds, were deduced from the extracted R. officinalis and A. indica, respectively, using this method. In R. officinalis extract, limonene is typically positioned as the main component (23.03%), while the main chemicals identified in A. indica extract were methyl (E)-octadec-13-enoate (23.20%) and (2R)-1,3,8-trimethyl-4-propyl-5-ethyl-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-7-methoxycardonylethyl-6-methylenecarbonyl-porphyrin (23.03%). Both extracts of R. officinalis and A. indica exhibited different toxicity against the stored grain pest T. castaneum, with LC50 values of 1.470 and 2.588 mg/ml, respectively. Additionally, after 4 and 5 h of treatment at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, the A. indica extract showed the highest levels of repellent action (81.4% and 93.4%), and the R. officinalis extract showed a good repellent rate (64.9% and 80.7%) against T. castenum larvae. With an IC50 value of 35.83 and 28.68 mg/L and a radical scavenging activity percentage of 67.76% and 72.35%, the leaf extract was found to be the most potent plant extract when tested for DPPH antioxidant activity. Overall results showed that MeOH extracts of R. officinalis and A. indica were more effective against S. aureus than E. coli. To determine how the investigated chemicals attach to the active sites of E. coli DNA gyrase A and S. aureus undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, docking studies were carried out. The consensus score analysis showed that limonene exhibits the best binding energy with both enzymes in docking analysis and more stability in molecular dynamics simulations. The RMSD was obtained at 20.6 and 4.199 (Kcal/mole). The two compounds were successfully used in molecular dynamics simulation research to generate stable complexes with DNA gyrase A."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although chronic wounds are devastating and can cause burden at multiple levels, chronic wound research is still far behind. Chronic wound treatment is often less efficient due to delay in diagnosis and treatment, non-specific treatment mainly due to lack of knowledge of wound healing or healing resistance genes. It's known that chronic wounds do not progress towards healing, because it gets stalled in inflammatory phase of wound healing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use phytoextracts possessing excellent anti-inflammatory properties to regulate the unbalanced levels of cytokines responsible for increased inflammation. METHODS: Evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of selected phytoextracts namely, Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, Acacia catechu (L.f) Willd., Curcuma longa (L.), Allium sativum (L.), Punica granatum (L.) and Azadirachta indica A. hereafter, called as catechin, epicatechin, curcumin, garlic, pomegranate and neem extracts, respectively in Acute wound fibroblasts (AWFs) and Chronic wound fibroblasts (CWFs) using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The phytoextracts exhibited no cytotoxicity below 100 μg/ml on normal Human Dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), while garlic extract showed highest cell viability followed by catechin, epicatechin, curcumin, pomegranate peel and neem based on IC50 value. Garlic, catechin and epicatechin extracts showed highest anti-inflammatory activities for both TGF-β and TNF-α in both AWFs and CWFs treated cells. After treatment of AWFs with catechin, epicatechin and garlic extracts, TGF-β and TNF-α expression was significantly reduced compared to untreated AWFs and reached to almost normal HDFs level. Also, after treatment of CWFs with catechin, epicatechin and garlic extracts, TGF-β and TNF-α expression was significantly reduced compared to untreated CWFs and was lesser than untreated AWFs. CONCLUSION: The present findings reveal the potential of catechin, epicatechin and garlic extracts for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds with excellent anti-inflammatory properties.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of neem seed biochar, poultry manure, and their combinations at varying rates of 15 and 25% (w/w) on potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in soils. Afterward, the suitability of Manihot esculenta and Jatropha curcas in removing Cd, As, Zn, Pb, and Hg from mine spoils were appraised in a 270-day outdoor pot experiment. Using ICP-Mass Spectrometry, the elemental contents of target PTE in the shoot, root, and soil specimens were determined for each treatment. The obtained average values were further subjected to a nonparametric test of samples using IBM SPSS Statistic 29. The applied organic amendments resulted in significant differences p < 0.05 in PTE availability for plant uptake after the Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test was made. Nonetheless, applying a 25% (w/w) mixture of neem seed biochar and poultry manure was efficient in immobilizing more PTEs in soils which caused lower PTEs presence in plants. Organic amendments further significantly enhanced the fertility of the mine soils leading to about a 6- 25.00% increase in the biomass yield (p < 0.05) of both plants. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was however observed between the phytoremediation potentials of both plants after the Independent-Sample Mann-Whitney U test. Even that, Manihot esculenta was averagely more efficient in PTE uptake than Jatropha curcas. Larger portions of the bioaccumulated PTEs were stored in the roots of both plants leading to high bioconcentration factors of 1.94- 2.47 mg/kg and 1.27- 4.70 mg/kg, respectively, for Jatropha curcas and Manihot esculenta. A transfer factor < 1 was achieved for all PTEs uptake by both plants and indicated their suitability for phytostabilization. Techniques for easy cultivation of root-storing PTEs are required to enhance their large-scale use as their biomass could further be used in clean energy production.",

      "abstract": "Multiple drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a serious cause of concern, and they can be observed in hospital settings, natural environment, and animals. Dissemination of multiple drug-resistant (MDR) E. coli can pose a high risk to public health. Moreover, they are hard to control with commercial antibiotics, since they have acquired resistance against most of them. Therefore, to control multiple drug-resistant bacteria, alternative strategies have been adopted such as phage therapy, herbal remedies, nanoparticles etc. In the current study, the combined application of neem leaf extract and bacteriophage is used to control an isolated multiple drug-resistant E. coli E1. We have applied 0.1 mg/ml concentration of neem extract in combination with an isolated phage vB_EcoM_C2 of 1011 titer and found that the combinatorial treatment approach significantly controls the growth of E. coli E1 as compared to a single non-combinatorial treatment. In this study, every E. coli cell is targeted by 2 antimicrobials (phage and neem extract) at the same time, which is more effective as compared to the sole treatment. Implementation of the neem extract with phage opens a new alternative approach to the chemotherapeutics for the control of multiple drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. This approach may be effective, economical, and eco-friendly to combat MDR."

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a common skin disorder with a complicated etiology. Papules, lesions, comedones, blackheads, and other skin lesions are common physical manifestations of Acne vulgaris, but the individual who has it also regularly has psychological repercussions. Natural oils are being utilized more and more to treat skin conditions since they have fewer negative effects and are expected to provide benefits. Using network pharmacology, this study aims to ascertain if neem oil has any anti-acne benefits and, if so, to speculate on probable mechanisms of action for such effects. The neem leaves (Azadirachta indica) were collected, verified, authenticated, and assigned a voucher number. After steam distillation was used to extract the neem oil, the phytochemical components of the oil were examined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The components of the oil were computationally examined for drug-likeness using Lipinski's criteria. The Pharm Mapper service was used to anticipate the targets. Prior to pathway and protein-protein interaction investigations, molecular docking was performed to predict binding affinity. Neem oil was discovered to be a potential target for STAT1, CSK, CRABP2, and SYK genes in the treatment of Acne vulgaris. In conclusion, it was discovered that the neem oil components with PubChem IDs: ID_610088 (2-(1-adamantyl)-N-methylacetamide), ID_600826 (N-benzyl-2-(2-methyl-5-phenyl-3H-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)acetamide), and ID_16451547 (N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(1-phenyltetrazol-5-yl)sulfanylpropanamide) have strong affinities for these drug targets and may thus be used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of acne.",

Recently, Neem oil has been considered a herbal option for the management of superficial wounds. Wound care is a complex process that involves several factors including the patient, caregiver, and medications. Herbal combinations could be an alternative to the chemical counterparts in the wound care area. This report includes an investigation of the possible supportive impacts of the St. John's wort and Neem oil containing ointment (W Cura G Plus ®) in the management of pressure ulcers (PUs) in three intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Materials and Methods: The ointment was administered to individuals once daily for 42 consecutive days. The status of individuals was macroscopically monitored by measuring the PU area and histopathological assessment of the tissue sections taken on the first and last days of wound treatment. Results: The outcomes of the macroscopic and histopathological techniques exhibited that St. John's wort and Neem oil containing ointment provided a remarkable supportive impact on the patients that suffered from PUs in the ICUs. Conclusions: The combination of St. John's wort and Neem oil could be suggested as an efficient active phytoconstituent for the management of PUs.

Different grades of nanofibers mats (NFM) were prepared by combining different ratios of NGP and PVA which were later crosslinked using glutaraldehyde vapors (25 % w/v in 0.5 M HCl), and optimized grade G14 exhibited maximum tensile strength with smooth surface morphology, hemocompatible properties, in-vitro biodegradability and antimicrobial action against S. aureus & E. coli. G14 was analytically characterized using different analytical techniques viz. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which indicated polymer-polymer compatibility. The surface hydrophobicity as detected using Optical contact angle (OCA) confirmed the hydrophobicity of NFM with increased glutaraldehyde vapor for crosslinking when compared to non-crosslinked NFM.

High humidity and temperature during this period can encourage increased seed moisture and pests, thereby lowering seed quality. Following a farm household survey conducted to inform trial design, eighty farmers were engaged in an action research process in which they participated in designing and conducting trials comparing traditional and alternative seed storage methods over 30 weeks. Factorial treatments included comparison of hermetic SuperGrainbags® (Premium RZ) against LDPE bags, both with and without the addition of dried neem tree leaves (Azadirachta indica). SuperGrainbags® were more effective in maintaining seed moisture at acceptable levels close to pre-storage conditions than LDPE bags. Both seed germination and seedling coleoptile length were significantly greater in hermetic than LDPE bags. Neem had no effect on seed moisture, germination, or coleoptile length. SuperGrainbags® were also more effective in abating seed damage during storage, although inclusion of neem within LDPE bags also had significant damage. Quantification of seed predating insects and diseases suggested that SuperGrainbags® also suppressed Coleopteran pests and blackspot, the latter indicative of Fusarium graminearum. Conversely, where farmers used LDPE bags, neem also had an additional though limited pest suppressive effect. Post-storage treatment scoring by farmers revealed a strong preference for SuperGrainbags® and no preference differences for or against neem. This study demonstrates a process by which farmers can be involved in the participatory co-design and testing of alternative wheat storage options, and stresses the need to develop SuperGrainbag® supply chains so hermetic storage can be made widely available."

Four-day static renewal bioassay test was performed where sixteen healthy adult male crabs were exposed to 96-h LC50 values of Nimbecidine Plus (0.006284 ppt) and MOC aqueous extract (7.631 ppt) separately in the laboratory condition. Control groups were maintained throughout the experimental period without any biopesticide exposure. Various haemocyte parameters such as total count (THC), differential count (DHC), haemocyte density, cytomorphological anomalies and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured in the biopesticides-exposed and control crabs after 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of exposure. After treatment with Nimbecidine Plus and MOC, several cytomorphological deformities (cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane disintegration, chromatin condensation, pyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyolysis, nuclear vacuolation, altered cell shape, cellular coagulation, cytoplasmic discharge, vacuolation) were observed in hyalinocytes, small granule haemocytes and large granule haemocytes with modulation of their relative percentages at different exposure times. THC, DHC, haemocyte density and ROS levels were significantly altered (p < 0.05) in biopesticides-exposed crabs at different exposure periods. The toxicity of both biopesticides did not persist throughout the entire exposure time. Nimbecidine Plus exhibited nonlinear toxic impacts on different haemocyte parameters at initial, mid and higher exposure periods whereas MOC showed linear toxic effects mostly at initial exposure time. In comparison to MOC, Nimbecidine Plus showed higher immunotoxic effects in V. litterata. Outcome of this experiment might provide useful information to understand the immune responses of V. litterata against biopesticide toxicity.",

A. indica oil significantly reduced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation compared to the OTA group. In addition, the hepatic histological evaluation showed significant adipose tissue accumulation in OTA-treated tissues, while treatment with 170 mg/kg A. indica oil showed moderate adipose tissue accumulation."

Denture stomatitis's etiology is complex, but there is evidence that it is brought on by Candida albicans growing in biofilms on its surface. Objective This study aimed to examine and assess the effectiveness of several herbal products, such as tea tree oil and neem extracts, on Candida albicans adhesion to denture soft liners. Method Each wall of the tissue culture plate was filled with 30 acrylic blocks lined with soft liners, followed by the addition of 0.1 ml of the standardized Candida albicans suspension, which was then left to incubate for 48 hours. Each specimen was placed in a disinfectant solution for 10 minutes. A colony was counted after 0.1ml of the solution was plated on a sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate and cultured for 72 hours. Data were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Results The mean colony forming units (CFU) per ml for combined tea tree oil and neem extract was least (0.40), followed by tea tree oil (2.30), followed by neem extract (30.33). The treated blocks were effective in reducing the growth of Candida albicans. Conclusion Combining tea tree oil and neem extract significantly reduced the growth of Candida albicans, suggesting a new form of intraoral effective antifungal treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer remains one of the significant causes of mortality in women due to the limitations of current treatment strategies and their associated side effects. Investigation of alternative medicine, including phytomedicine, has shown effective anti-cancer potential with fewer side effects. Azadirachta indica (commonly known as neem) is known for its medicinal properties. The present study investigated the anti-cancer potential of methanolic neem stem bark extract (MNBE) against cervical cancer using HeLa, SiHa, and ME-180 cell lines. METHODS: Cytotoxic effect of MNBE on cultured cell lines was evaluated by MTT and clonogenic assay. The growth-inhibiting effect of MNBE was further confirmed by performing cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay using flow cytometry. The anti-migratory effect of MNBE was evaluated by using wound healing and Boyden chamber assay. Real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression, and western blot and flow cytometry was used to determine the protein levels of growth and migration-related genes. RESULTS: MNBE significantly suppressed the growth and survival of cervical cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, the growth inhibitory effect of MNBE was specific to cervical cancer cells than normal cells. Cell cycle arrest was correlated to transcriptional downregulation of cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cyclin A, and cyclin B. Additionally, MNBE treatment resulted in the upregulation of active caspase-3 protein and downregulation of prosurvival genes, Bcl2, and survivin at mRNA level and NFkB-p65 at the protein level. Furthermore, MNBE inhibited the migration of cervical cancer cells accompanied by modulation of migration-related genes, including zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), N-cadherin, snail, and E-cadherin. CONCLUSION: In summary, the present study provides the first evidence of MNBE in restricting cervical cancer cell growth and migration, which warrants further investigation for developing novel anti-cancer drugs.",

Excess ROS production has detrimental effects on the survival of cells. We examined the protective effect of a semi-natural compound NF2 (deacetylepoxyazadiradione), for its protective activity against free radical-mediated stress and inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using zebrafish larvae. Preliminary antioxidant assays indicated an increase in scavenging of free radicals from NF2 than NF1 (Epoxyazadiradione) in a concentration-dependent manner. Cell cytotoxicity was determined using rat myoblast cell lines (L6), and more than 95 % of cell viability was obtained. Zebrafish developmental toxicity test indicated that NF2 is not toxic even at 150 μM. The percentage of ROS, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide and apoptosis were reduced significantly in NF2 treated LPS-stressed zebrafish larvae. The reduced number of employed macrophages on NF2 treatment was observed in neutral red dye-marked macrophage localization images. Relative expression of antioxidant genes in zebrafish larvae after treatment with NF2 is significantly increased. The RT-PCR quantification of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory gene expression indicated decreased relative folds of pro-inflammatory cytokines, iNOS and increased relative folds of mitochondrial antioxidant genes (GR, GST and GPx) in LPS stressed zebrafish larvae after treatment with NF2. From the overall obtained results, it can be concluded that NF2 reduced the oxidative stress and inflammatory response by scavenging free radicals caused by LPS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Multiple studies have demonstrated the medical potency of plant extracts and specific phytochemicals as therapeutics for prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Of note, the Neem plant known for its role as an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory is underexplored with an untapped potential for further development. This review focuses on extracts and phytochemicals derived from the Neem tree (Latin name; Azadirachta indica), commonly used throughout Southeast Asia for the prevention and treatment of a wide array of diseases including cancer. To date, there are more than 130 biologically active compounds that have been isolated from the Neem tree including azadirachtin, nimbolinin, nimbin, nimbidin, nimbidol, which have demonstrated a wide range of biological activities including anti-microbial, anti-fertility, anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic, hepatoprotective, anti-diabetic, anti-ulcer, and anti-cancer effects. Very few scientific reports focus on the benefits of Neem in PCa, even though this herb has been used to prevent the disease and its progression for years in complementary and alternative medicine. METHODS: We used the search engines like PubMed, InCommon and Google using the key words: \"Neem\", \"Cancer\", \"Prostate Cancer\" and related words to find the information and data within the time frame from 1980-2022 for our article study. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Here, we provide an overview of Neem extracts and phytochemical derivatives with a focus on their known potential and ability to inhibit specific cellular signaling pathways and processes which drive PCa incidence and progression. CONCLUSIONS: The information presented here indicate that Neem and its derivatives have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of PCa when used as a single agent or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics."

      "abstract": "Tick infestation remains one of the major health problems that affect the productivity and comfort of camels. The control of ticks mainly relies on using chemical acaracides. Limited information is available on the potential benefits and activity of various neem extracts on Hyalomma ticks. The present study investigated the acaricidal activity of neem seed extracts at different concentrations against developmental stages of the camel tick Hyalomma dromedarii in comparison to Butox and diazinon. The acaricidal activity of three extracts, namely, hexane extract (HE), methyl chloride extract (MCE), and methanol extract (ME), of neem seeds (Azadirachta indica) were tested at varying concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20% on engorged H. dromedarii female ticks at days 1, 3, 5, 7, 12, 16, 20, 28, 37, and 43 after treatment (DPT). Interestingly, results of applying different neem seed extracts to engorged H. dromedarii female ticks showed that the most effective extract was hexane at concentration 20%, causing 100% mortality at 1st day post-application, while methanol extract at 20% and dichloromethane extract at 20% caused the death of all ticks at 28th day posttreatment as compared to Butox® 5.0 and Diazinon-60, which resulted in mortality of all ticks at 3 and 5 DPT, respectively. In addition, no mortality was reported with the application of aqueous extract (AE), which served as the control group. Furthermore, the neem hexane extract exhibited high efficacy against reproductive performance of female ticks, whereas no fertility or oviposition was reported at all of their concentrations. Additionally, no hatchability occurred using all neem extracts, except the aqueous extract, which showing no effect. In the present study, larvae responded more rapidly to the plant extracts, whereas mortality of all larvae was recorded at 24 h after treatment with 5% hexane. Taken together, this study pointed out that the acaricidal effect of hexane extract of neem seeds was more effective and could be economically used for controlling H. dromedarii ticks."

Materials and Methodology. Fourteen systemically healthy participants with 4-6 mm deep periodontal pockets at least in three quadrants (with no alveolar bony defect amenable to respective or regenerative osseous surgery, as seen in orthopantomograph) were selected for the trial. One week after phase I therapy, 10% absorbable chip of neem (commercially prepared by staff of a pharmacy college, Sheriguda, India) was placed in the periodontal pocket on one site, and soft tissue diode laser pocket sterilization was performed on the other site of the arch. Remaining one site was considered as a control. Parameters recorded clinically were plaque index (PI), papillary bleeding index (PBI), probing pocket depth (PPD), and relative attachment level (RAL) measured at baseline, 21st day, and one month postoperatively. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were observed in all clinical parameters at one month as compared to baseline for both treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Neem chip supplemented with phase I therapy showed best improvement in clinical parameters followed by laser supplemented with phase I therapy in comparison to phase I therapy alone at one month follow-up. Clinical Significance. Neem chips are nature's products, affordable without side effects, with a potential to be used as a local drug delivery agent in treating moderate chronic periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Azadirachta indica (A. Juss), also known as the neem tree, has been used for millennia as a traditional remedy for a multitude of human ailments. Also recognized around the world as a broad-spectrum pesticide and fertilizer, neem has applications in agriculture and beyond. Currently, the extensive antimicrobial activities of A. indica are being explored through research in the fields of dentistry, food safety, bacteriology, mycology, virology, and parasitology. Herein, some of the most recent studies that demonstrate the potential of neem as a previously untapped source of novel therapeutics are summarized as they relate to the aforementioned research topics. Additionally, the capacity of neem extracts and compounds to act against drug-resistant and biofilm-forming organisms, both of which represent large groups of pathogens for which there are limited treatment options, are highlighted. Updated information on the phytochemistry and safety of neem-derived products are discussed as well. Although there is a growing body of exciting evidence that supports the use of A. indica as an antimicrobial, additional studies are clearly needed to determine the specific mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and in vivo safety of neem as a treatment for human pathogens of interest. Moreover, the various ongoing studies and the diverse properties of neem discussed herein may serve as a guide for the discovery of new antimicrobials that may exist in other herbal panaceas across the globe."

A 90-days experimental trial was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary leaf extract of neem tree Azadirachta indica as a feeding supplement on the growth performance and proximate composition of O. mykiss. Four experimental diets were designed as T1 (with 5% A. indica leaf extract), T2 (with 7% of A. indica leaf extract), T3 (with 10% A. indica leaf extract), and T4 (control group feed with a regular diet with 0% A. indica leaf extract). The average initial weight of fry 0.4 ± 0.14 g was stocked at 25 fish/tank with two replicates per treatment (4 × 2 = 8). After 90 days of the experimental trial, One-way ANOVA showed significant differences in final body weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, and survival rate among the treatment groups (p < 0.05). The highest final body weight (48.10 g) and weight gain (47.70 g) was observed in T2 with 7% A. indica leaf extract, which was significantly different from the other treatments (p < 0.05). The lowest FCR was recorded in T2 (1.90), which was significantly different compared to other treatment groups (p < 0.05). Inclusion of A. indica leaf extract in formulated feed for rainbow trout had significant effects in the hepatosomatic index, viscerosomatic index and Fulton's condition factor (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the survival rate of rainbow trout fry treated with different experimental diets (p > 0.05). The phenomenal regression indicates that 7.5% A. indica inclusion is optimum for best growth performance for rainbow trout under a controlled environment. Thus, the present study suggests that the dietary leaf extract has performed an excellent nutritional supplement by enhancing growth performance and health conditions of rainbow trout in the hatchery conditions."

Natural products have shown great promise in the treatment of many viral related diseases. In this work, using in silico methods, bioactive compounds from the neem tree were investigated for their ability to block viral cell entry as spike RBD-ACE2 inhibitors. Azadirachtin H, quentin and margocin were identified as potential compounds that demonstrated viral cell entry inhibition properties. The structural re-orientation of azadirachtin H was observed as the mechanism for viral cell entry inhibition. These compounds possessed good pharmacodynamic properties. The proposed molecules can serve as a starting point towards developing effective anti-SARS-COV-2 drugs targeting the inhibition of viral cell entry upon further in vitro and in vivo validation."

This study has focused on verifying the most effective non-toxic dose of the Neem (Azadirachta indica) and (flubendazole) bath treatment on infested D. labrax fingerlings. METHODS: In the first phase of the experiment, a total of 180 apparently healthy fingerlings were subdivided into six groups for each treatment. The tested concentrations were 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg L-1 for A. indica and 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg L-1 for flubendazole. The second phase was conducted for one week in five groups for each treatment. The first group was untreated healthy. The remaining groups were infested and received different concentrations of 0, 50, 100, and 150 mg L-1 & 0, 10, 20, and 30 mg L-1 for A. indica and flubendazole, respectively. RESULTS: The most toxic dose exhibited high mortality rates at 200 & 250 and 40 & 50 mg L-1 for A. indica and flubendazole, respectively. In the second phase of the experiment, the most effective dose was 150 and 30 mg L-1; for A. indica and flubendazole, respectively. They demonstrated the lowest mortality rates 20.00 & 20.00 %, prevalence rates 43.33 & 23.33%, and mean parasitic intensities were 2.35 & 2.00 accompanied by the highest therapeutic efficacy value 67.85 & 74.6% for both treatments; respectively. CONCLUSION: The most effective anthelmintic efficacy has been assigned for flubendazole and A. indica at 30 and 150 mg L-1.",

During the current study two cultivars of quinoa (V7 and V9) were used. This study revealed that water stress adversely affects the fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots as well as chlorophyll pigments (a and b) of both quinoa cultivars. In contrast, drought stress enhanced glycinebetaine (GB), free proline, phenolic content, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) enzymes, and relative membrane permeability (RMP). However, application of neem leaf extract improved the accumulation of key osmoprotectants like proline, GB and activities of enzymatic antioxidants. Our findings showed 5 % neem leaf extract is an effective treatment in counteracting the oxidative damage caused by water stress, thereby improving overall plant growth. Of both cultivars of quinoa, the response of cv. V9 to stress as well as foliar applied neem was relatively more promising."

Nevertheless, the present circumstances provide the best opening for Covid Associated Mucormycosis (CAM), as the global pandemic is engulfing a large part of human population making them immunocompromised. This drastic increase in Mucormycosis infections has to be addressed as early as possible. There is a growing tendency of relying upon herbal drugs that have minimal side effects and does not compromise our immune system. Recently, the concept of network pharmacology has grabbed the attention of modern science, especially advanced medical sciences.

In this study, Neem and Turmeric was considered as the target plants and an attempt was made to reveal various aspects through which phytocompounds derived from them may effectively manage CAM menace. We have taken a step-by-step approach for identifying the target proteins and ligands associated with Mucormycosis treatment. Functional network analysis and Molecular docking approaches were applied to validate our findings. Quercetin derived from both Neem and Turmeric was found to be one of the main phytocompounds working against Mucormycosis. Along with that, Caffeic acid, Curcumin, Kaempferol, Tetrahydrocurcumin and Myricetin also play a pivotal role in fighting against Black-Fungus. A thorough analysis of our result suggested a triple-front attack on the fungal pathogens and the approaches are necrosis inhibition, iron chelation and immuno-boosting.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

      "abstract": "Plant extracts represent a rich repository of metabolites with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a medicinal plant considered the tree of the 21st century. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of propyl disulfide (PD), a major volatile compound in neem seed, against the pericarp browning (BI), microbial decay incidence (DI), and water loss of longan fruit. Fresh longan cv. Shixia samples were packaged in oriented polypropylene (OPP) and polyethene (PE) packages of different thicknesses (20, 40, and 60 µm). Sterile gauze was fixed inside the packages and 500 uL of PD was placed on them to avoid the direct contact of PD with fruit samples. Packages were sealed immediately to minimize vaporization and stored at 12 ± 1 °C for 18 days. Fruit samples packaged in open net packages served as controls. The results showed that fruit treated with PD in OPP and PE packages significantly prevented losses of water, DI, and BI compared to control treatment. PD also maintained the color, TSS values, TA values, pH values, high peel firmness, high TPC content, and high TFC content, and reduced the activity levels of PPO and POD. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis indicated that the exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp of longan peel were smooth, uniform, and compact with no free space compared to control, where crakes, a damaged and loose structure, and a lot of fungal mycelia were found. The shortest shelf life of 9 days was observed in control as compared to 18 days in OPP-20 and OPP-40; 15 days in OPP-60, PE-20, and PE-40; and 12 days in PE-60 packaging films. Therefore, PD as a natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agent, in combination with OPP-20 and OPP-40 polymeric films, could successfully be applied commercially to extend the postharvest shelf life of longan."

With ~ 15% of the over 2 million new cases each year, there is an unmet need to treat TNBC. MDA-MB-231, human TNBC cells, were treated with neem leaf extract (Neem) and eight, 1200 V/cm, 100 µs electric pulses (EP), and their viability and proteomic profiles were studied. With EP + Neem, a lower viability of 37% was observed after 24 h, compared to 85% in the neem-only samples, indicating the efficacy of the combinational treatment. The proteomics results indicated significant upregulation of 525 proteins and downregulation of 572 proteins, with a number of different pathways in each case. These include a diverse group of proteins, such as receptors, heat shock proteins, and many others. The upregulated TCA cycle and OXPHOS pathways and the downregulated DNA replication and ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathways were associated with effective cell death, demonstrating the potency of this treatment. Viability results reveal the efficacious anticancer effects of the EP + Neem combination, via growth inhibition, on TNBC cells. Proteomics studies could readily identify the effected protein pathways, and their corresponding genes, that are responsible for cell death. This represents a potential therapeutic strategy against TNBC when patients are refractory to standard treatments.",

A single material that fulfills all the requirements of an ideal root canal filling material for primary teeth is yet unavailable. Hence, this study was initiated to evaluate clinically and radiographically, the efficacy of two obturating materials - zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) and zinc oxide mixed with Neem oil (ZON) for 12 months. AIMS: To assess the success rate of a mixture of zinc oxide and neem oil in comparison to zinc oxide-eugenol paste, as an obturating material in primary molars. To compare the efficacy of ZON as an obturating material at the various time interval of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This split-mouth, double-blind study was performed on 24 children aged 5-7 years, who presented with bilaterally infected primary molars. Total 48 infected primary molars were divided into two groups for pulpectomy followed by obturation with ZOE and ZON, respectively. Randomization with the chit-pick method, for the control and experimental drug, was performed. A follow-up for 12 months was performed. The Chi-square test was used for inter-group comparison and the Z test was used for the analysis of data over a period of time. RESULTS: Overall clinical findings in this study revealed 91.7% results in ZOE compared with 100% results in the ZON group. The radiographical findings revealed 91.7% results in ZOE compared with 100% success in the ZON group. CONCLUSION: ZON demonstrated excellent effectiveness as an obturating material in the 12-month follow-up period as compared to ZOE in primary teeth. The efficacy elicited in this study could be a basis to recommend ZON as herbal alternative obturation material."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dermatological disorders are cutaneous infirmities which are frequently occurring and increasing at an alarming rate. These range from mild itching/redness (dermatitis) to fatal skin cancers and has posed a major health concern. Azadirachta indica A. Juss (commonly known as neem), a member of Meliaceae family, is an Indian medicinal plant which has been known for its health promoting effects since ancient times. OBJECTIVE: The review highlights the traditional practices, pharmacological aspects, and formulatory approach of neem for the treatment of dermatological disorders. Further, recent patents and novel delivery systems (developed and in pipeline) improving skin delivery and therapeutic profile of neem are discussed. RESULTS: Neem is a traditional medicinal plant that has been employed for the prevention and treatment of numerous ailments covering systemic and topical disorders. Scientific studies have validated the traditional claims of neem and attributed these health benefits to the presence of more than 300 structurally diverse and complex compounds. It possesses anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, analgesic, antiviral, antifungal, immunomodulatory and antioxidant activities which substantiate its use as skin therapy. Various novel formulations and associated patents that improved the permeability of neem based products across skin could be found in literature. CONCLUSION: Critical appraisal of available literature revealed that neem possesses anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiseptic properties. Thus it has the potential to be developed as a single effective therapy for the management of multimodal skin disorders. Further, pharmaceutical tailoring of neem by implication of novel carriers could enhance its penetrability across skin.",

      "abstract": "Only 2.5% of the world's water is fresh, despite the fact that water covers approximately 70% of the planet. This water is used for several recreational purposes and gets polluted by wastewater disposal directly into freshwater bodies. Effluents dispersed into water bodies could be from various sources like industries, households, and agricultural activities. These effluents comprise heavy metals and chemical wastes directly released into water bodies without treatment and could include major contaminants like nitrates, nitrites, ammonia and phosphates. The present study mainly focuses on removal of four significant pollutants from agriculture wastes, i.e., nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, and phosphates. These pollutants are removed using adsorbents via a process known as adsorption. Adsorbents used in the study are fish scales and neem leaves. Several studies have been carried out to measure the efficiency of adsorbents in the removal of contaminants. These studies include equilibrium studies, kinetic studies and isotherm studies. Based on a complete analysis and results obtained, 95% to 99% of contaminants can be removed effectively with an adsorbent dosage of 0.4g (0.2 g of fish scale and 0.2 g of neem leaves powder), optimum pH of 6 and at 303K constant temperature. The dosage variance stems from changing the dosages of two adsorbents in three ways, i.e., by taking both adsorbents in equal dosages, and increasing the dosage of one adsorbent compared to the other and vice versa. The contact time varied from 0 to 140min and the Initial concentration of pollutants has also been varied from 30 to 70 mg/L. In addition to the above variations, thermodynamic studies were also done, and based on the negative values of ΔG and positive value of ΔH and ΔS, it is evident that the reaction of novel adsorbent (combination of fish scales and neem leaves) is spontaneous and endothermic.",

The standard treatment involves topical and oral antibiotics, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and other synthetic compounds, mostly associated with adverse effects. Hence, herbal skincare products are considered nowadays. AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Purifying Neem Face Wash (PNFW), an herbal skincare product in the prevention and/or reduction of mild-to-moderate acne. METHODS: An open-label, single-center, single-arm, four-week clinical study was conducted with subjects having either mild-to-moderate acne or oily skin and non-existent acne. The performance of PNFW in the reduction and/or prevention of acne was detected by counting cutaneous inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions in each of the four visits. Sebum level and skin hydration of both cheeks were measured via sebumeter and corneometer, respectively. Self-assessment questionnaires were used to assess the subjects' responses toward PNFW. RESULTS: Out of 120 study subjects, 79% and 72% showed either reduction or no new appearance of inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions, respectively, from baseline to Visits 3 and 4. Skin sebum level and skin hydration showed a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.001) and increase (p < 0.001), respectively, in Visits 3 and 4. Self-assessment surveys showed the satisfaction of the subjects about the product in terms of condition improvement, ease in use, and fragrance. CONCLUSION: The present study indicated the beneficial effect of the herbal ingredients (neem and turmeric) of Himalaya's PNFW in the prevention and reduction of mild-to-moderate acne with no side effects.",

All rabbits were inoculated with 5 × 104&nbsp;Eimeria spp. oocysts (E. intestinalis (67%), E. magna (22%), and E. media (11%)) except for the rabbits in the first group (G1), which were inoculated with a sterile solution and served as a negative control. The remaining four groups were treated as follows: G2, no treatment/positive control, G3, treated with neem leaf extract, G4, treated with pomegranate peel extract (PPE), and G5, treated with a combination of neem leaf extract and PPE. For both breeds, our results showed that the use of neem leaf and/or pomegranate peel extract resulted in improved growth performance, with a significant improvement in relative feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to the positive control groups, which recorded the worst values, as well as a significant (p ≤ 0.05) reduction in mean oocyst count compared to the positive control groups. We also observed downregulation of mRNA levels of IL-1βα, IL6, and TNF-α in the herbal treatment groups compared with the mRNA levels of these genes in the positive control groups. Herbal treatment with neem leaf and/or pomegranate peel extracts had positive effects on the NZ and VL rabbits experimentally infected with mixed Eimeria species, as evidenced by their healthy appearance, good appetite, no mortalities, an anticoccidial index > 120, and a significantly higher total return and net profit when compared to the positive control groups of both breeds. In NZ rabbits, the treatment with neem leaf extract alone (G3) or in combination with PPE (G5) recorded the most efficient economic anticoccidial activity."

Hence, the present study evaluated to apply dried neem leaf powder (DNL) as an additive to reduce the usage of salt in skin processing and preservation. To make certain of DNL antimicrobial properties, solvent extracts were performed against proteolytic bacteria isolated from raw skins. Initial characterization of DNL revealed the presence of bioactive compounds nimbolide and dehydro salannol and acetone extract with 16.9-mm, 10-mm and 8-mm zone of inhibition against Salmonella sp., E. coli sp. and Bacillus sp. identified using phenotypic conventional biochemical screening method. Further, skin curing experiments were carried out using four different treatments of DNL (10% 15%, 20% and 25% w/w) along with 15% w/w of conventional salt to obtain an optimum concentration for pilot-scale studies. Thus, the application of optimal DNL (15%) and salt (15%) resulted in no physical changes such as smell and hair slip and was taken for further studies for hydroxyproline activity, pollution load and organoleptic properties along compared with control 40% salt. DNL-aided salt less preservation of freshly flayed goat skins at ambient condition showed no hair slip or putrefaction during the preservation period with significant reduction of TDS (86%) and chloride (71%) in soak liquors compared to conventional salt preservation and enhanced organic load requiring additional treatment. However, the application of the organoleptic, physical and hydrothermal properties of resulting leathers produced from the DNL applied skins was on par with results of leather obtained from conventional salt. Thus, our results demonstrate DNL-aided salt less preservation method is able to reduce the amount of salt for preservation of goat skins significantly, leading to reduced salinity issues during leather processing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Azadirachta indica A. Juss. is an Indian medicinal plant with innumerable pharmacological properties. Studies have proven that the phytochemicals from neem possess remarkable contraceptive abilities with limited knowledge on its mechanism of action. PURPOSE: The present review aims to summarize the efficiency of A. indica treatment as a contraceptive. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Published scientific articles on antifertility, antispermatogenic, antiovulation, hormone altering, contraceptive, and abortifacient activities of A. indica were collected from reputed Journals from 1980 to 2020 using electronic databases. Specific keywords search was completed to collect numerous articles with unique experiment design and significant results. This was followed by the selection of the requisite articles based on the criteria designed by the authors. Data extraction was based on the common research elements included in the articles. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were considered for reviewing, which included key pharmacological investigations. In the beginning, authors evaluated a number of publications on the contraceptive properties of A. indica, in which it was revealed that most of the publications were made between 2005 and 2009. All the collected articles were categorised and reviewed as antifertility, antispermatogenic, antiovulation, hormone altering, contraceptive, and abortifacient. Authors also assessed studies based on the plant parts used for pharmacological evaluations including leaves, seeds, stem-bark, and flowers. The article was primarily divided into different sections based on the previous works of authors on phytochemistry and pharmacological review articles. CONCLUSION: Although A. indica is not reported with the complete alleviation of reproductive system in both male and female animal models, studies have proven its efficacy as a contraceptive. Extracts and phytochemicals from neem neither reduced the libido nor retarded the growth of secondary sexual characters, thus indicating only a temporary and reversible contraceptive activity. However, there is a dearth for clinical studies to prove the efficacy of A. indica as a herbal contraceptive.",

Recently, the use of phytochemicals is suggested in the control and treatment of metabolic syndrome. The Azadirachta indica (neem) is an evergreen tree belonging to the family of Meliaceae. Multiple studies have been confirmed the anti-diabetic and anti-hypertension, anti-hyperlipidemia, and anti-obesity effects of neem. In this review, we reported the protective effects of neem against the complications of metabolic syndrome with a special focus on mechanisms that are involved. It has been shown that neem can control hyperglycemia and hypertension through over-expression of transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and anti-oxidant effects. Neem also reduced the glucose uptake through up-regulation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and inhibition of key intestinal enzymes such as glucosidases. Moreover, neem showed anti-hypertensive effects possibility via the block of calcium channels, up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Anti-oxidant effects play an important role in protective mechanisms of neem against metabolic syndrome and its complications."

In the present review, we are going to classify in vitro and in vivo studies about anti-cancer activity of neem via its hepatic anti-oxidant activity. We also summarize its active ingredients and some therapeutic and toxic dosage forms. METHODS: A systematic search in the literature was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, as well as Google Scholar pre-print database using all available MeSH terms for neem, A. indica, anti-cancer, anti-tumor, carcinogen, liver, antioxidant activity, neem ingredients, and glutathione. Electronic database searches combined and duplicates were removed. RESULTS: The neem plant have been used in herbal medicine for the treatment of various diseases, particularly cancer. The mechanisms of anti-cancer effects of neem are far from clear. Cancerous cells growth can induce imbalance the oxidant and anti-oxidant activity in various organs particularly in the liver. Therefore, it seems that neem have anti-cancer effects via restore of the antioxidant disturbances close to the control ones in the liver. Additionally, administration of neem extract can induce oncostatic potential via several mechanism including; suppression of the NF-κβ pathway, increased expression of tumor suppressor (such as p53 and pTEN), decreased expression of oncogenes (such as c-Myc), and increased apoptosis in cancerous cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for extracts of neem was higher than 2,500 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that neem plays pivotal role in the prevention and treatment of cancer via its hepatic antioxidant activity. Indeed, application of neem extract can decreased tumor growth via restore of the antioxidant disturbances close to the control ones in the liver.",

Nine Omani male sheep (BW; 54.44 ± 8 kg/sheep) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin Square design with three dietary treatments and three periods, with each period lasting 21 days. The animals were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: basal diet without NSO (control); 20 mL/sheep per day NSO (low dose) or 40 mL/sheep per day NSO (high dose). Sheep fed with high dose presented lower (p < 0.05) intake, fiber digestibility, and excreted N in urine. However, diet supplemented with high NSO dose had a lower (p < 0.05) ruminal acetate proportion, while increased (p < 0.05) ruminal propionate compared to the control group. Moreover, sheep offered with NSO showed a linear decrease (p = 0.052) in ruminal ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration. The high dose increased (p < 0.05) blood glucose and cholesterol, while decreased urea nitrogen concentrations. Emission of predicted methane (CH4) reduced (p = 0.007) by 13% for high dose compared to the control group. In conclusion, these results suggested that NSO is a potential feed additive with up to 20 ml/kg of DM alters rumen fermentation profile, decreased CH4 production, feed digestibility, and nitrogen metabolism for sheep.",

The current study focuses on silver nanoparticle synthesis using neem leaf and banana peel extract and its application as an antimicrobial and dye degrading agent for wastewater treatment. The use of these extracts led to a rapid, simple, and environment-friendly method for the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). UV-Vis spectroscopy showed absorption bands at 473 and 423 nm for AgNPs synthesized from neem leaf and banana peel extracts, respectively. The AgNPs were further characterized using XRD, FTIR, ESEM, EDX, and DLS methods. XRD data confirmed the crystalline nature of the synthesized AgNPs. ESEM images revealed the synthesized nanoparticles were spherical. From DLS analysis the average diameter of the AgNPs was found to be 168.7 nm from banana peel and 206.4 nm from neem leaf extract. Antibacterial activity of synthesized nanoparticles at 0.025 mg/ml concentration was tested against Escherichia coli (E.coli), Bacillus subtilis (B.subtilis), Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus), and Klebsiella sp. using disk diffusion method and the zone of inhibitions observed were 10-13, 3-4, 2-3, and 1-3 nm respectively. 99% degradation of model dye malachite green was observed using banana peels-derived nanoparticles at a concentration of 0.06 mg/ml within 4.5 h. This study provides an eco-friendly and economic approach to AgNP synthesis and its potential application in the removal of hazardous dye from wastewater.",

The anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of neem make it a potential agent for COVID-19 prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the prophylactic effects of neem capsules for persons at high risk of COVID-19 infection due to contact with COVID-19 positive patients. DESIGN: The research team designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a single center in India. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 190 healthcare workers at the hospital or relatives of patients with COVID-19 infection. INTERVENTION: Of the 190 participants, 95 were in the intervention group and 95 in the control group. Participants received 50 mg of a proprietary, patent-pending, neem-leaf extract or a placebo orally in capsules, twice a day for 28 days. OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of individuals positive for COVID-19 between baseline and follow-up on day 56 was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures included an evaluation of neem's safety and its effects on quality of life (QOL) and changes in biomarkers. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 36.97 years, and 68.42% were male. Total 13 subjects tested positive during the study. All were asymptomatic. Of the 154 participants who completed the study per-protocol, 11 tested positive, 3 in the intervention group and 8 in the control group. The probability of COVID-19 infection in participants receiving the intervention was 0.45 times that of participants receiving the placebo, a relative risk of 0.45, with the effectiveness of the intervention being around 55%. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in both groups were minimal and were of grade 1 or 2 in severity. Biomarkers and QOL remained stable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study found a reduced risk of COVID-19 infection in participants receiving neem capsules, which demonstrates its potential as a prophylactic treatment for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. The findings warrant further investigation in clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study is to synthesize neem-silver nitrate nanoparticles (neem-AgNPs) using aqueous extracts of Azadirachta indica A. Juss for malaria therapy. Neem leaves collected from FRIM Malaysia were authenticated and extracted using Soxhlet extraction method. The extract was introduced to 1 mM of silver nitrate solution for neem-AgNPs synthesis. Synthesized AgNPs were further characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and the electron-scanning microscopy. Meanwhile, for the anti-plasmodial activity of the neem-AgNPs, two lab-adapted Plasmodium falciparum strains, 3D7 (chloroquine-sensitive), and W2 (chloroquine-resistant) were tested. Red blood cells hemolysis was monitored to observe the effects of neem-AgNPs on normal and parasitized red blood cells. The synthesized neem-AgNPs were spherical in shape and showed a diameter range from 31-43 nm. When compared to aqueous neem leaves extract, the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the synthesized neem-AgNPs showed a four-fold IC50 decrease against both parasite strains with IC50 value of 40.920 µg/mL to 8.815 µg/mL for 3D7, and IC50 value of 98.770 µg/mL to 23.110 µg/mL on W2 strain. The hemolysis assay indicates that the synthesized neem-AgNPs and aqueous extract alone do not have hemolysis activity against normal and parasitized red blood cells. Therefore, this study shows the synthesized neem-AgNPs has a great potential to be used for malaria therapy.",

METHODOLOGY: This parallel, prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with allocation ratio 1:1 was conducted in the out-patient clinic of the Endodontic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University, Egypt. Fifty healthy patients with mandibular molars with necrotic pulps were randomly assigned into two equal groups using computer software. In the intervention group, root canals were irrigated using Neem; whilst 2.5% NaOCl was used in the control group. A standard root canal treatment was performed in two visits using ProTaper Next rotary files, with no intracanal medication. Pain intensity was assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS) 6, 12, 24 and 48 h following instrumentation and canal filling. Endotoxin samples were collected using three paper points before and after canal instrumentation and a sandwich ELISA method was used to quantify the level of endotoxins. Demographic, baseline, and outcome data were collected and analysed using chi-square tests (for the comparisons of categorical variables), Mann-Whitney tests (for non-normally distributed variables) and Student's t tests (for normally distributed variables), A P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean pain scores within the two groups decreased continually over time. The mean pain scores in the Neem group were lower than those in the 2.5% NaOCl group at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h following instrumentation and canal filling with no significant difference between them except at 24 h following instrumentation (P = 0.012). Both irrigants significantly reduced endotoxin levels compared to the pre-instrumentation samples (P < 0.001) by 8% for the NaOCL group and 18% for the Neem group. CONCLUSION: Neem and 2.5% NaOCl were not significantly different in terms of reducing the intensity of post-operative pain during all follow-up periods except at 24 h following instrumentation where Neem was associated with lower pain intensity. Both irrigants significantly reduced endotoxin levels but were not effective in eliminating endotoxins completely from root canals of mandibular molars with necrotic pulps.",

The accumulative dose of radiation for the primary treatment of head and neck cancer treatment is 60 to 70 Gy, depending on the irradiation of the tumor. Ionizing Radiotherapy is used along with concurrent chemotherapy which is the standard treatment in locally advanced head and neck cancers. Radiation treatment is commonly delivered in the form of high energy photons through an external beam. These results in ionization of electrons that cause direct strand breaks of cellular DNA and the release of free radicals, resulting in cellular damage to both normal and tumor cells.

Counts of mange mites, scoring of lesion index, and calculation of rubbing index were done weekly. Topical application of 25% aqueous neem fruit extract had a higher efficacy ratio (p < 0.05) than the other fruit extract concentrations, and performed similarly to an amitraz-based acaricide, suggesting a dose-dependent response. Amitraz (positive control) cured clinical mange on grower pigs after 5 weeks and 25% aqueous neem fruit extract 6 weeks post-treatment.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Neem tree (Azadirachta indica) offers different bioactives ranging from pesticides to therapeutic molecules, depending on which part of the plant is used and the extraction methodology and the solvent used. This study was aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of a standardized aqueous extract of Azadirachta indica leaves and twigs (NEEM) on glycemic control, endothelial dysfunction, and systemic inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study (RCT), 80 T2DM subjects, who have already been on standard metformin therapy, received either 125 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg of NEEM or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Postprandial blood sugar level (PPBS), fasting blood sugar level (FBS), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance (IR), endothelial function, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, IL-6 and TNF-α, platelet aggregation and lipid profile were assessed. Adverse drug reactions, if any, were noted. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to perform statistical analysis. RESULTS: NEEM at the doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg BID significantly reduced PPBS (from 194.4±14 to 173.1±12.8mg/dL, 192.3±17.1 to 161.8±9.7mg/dL, and 205.9±7.2 to 159.3±7.1mg/dL, respectively), FBS (from 119.2±5.0 to 109.2±5.7mg/dL, 115.5±4.4 to 103.7±4.2mg/dL, and 120.7±4.2 to 97.3±3.7mg/dL, respectively), HbA1c (from 6.87 ± 0.4% to 6.64 ± 0.4%, 7.52 ± 0.4% to 6.86 ± 0.3%, and 7.78 ± 0.2% to 6.26 ± 0.4%, respectively), and IR (from 4.5 ± 1.2 to 3.4 ± 0.9, 3.8 ± 1.1 to 2.5 ± 0.6, and 4.6 ± 1.3 to 2.0 ± 0.6, respectively) compared to placebo. Also, NEEM significantly improved endothelial function, decreased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation compared to placebo. The efficacy was significant with all the doses, but no effect on platelet aggregation or lipid profile was observed. CONCLUSION: NEEM may significantly ameliorate hyperglycemia, endothelial dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, on top of what metformin could do, in subjects with T2DM."

      "abstract": "The present investigate was intended for adsorption of heavy metals i.e. Pb, Cu, Cr, Zn, Ni and Cd onto activated charcoal prepared from neem leaf powder (AC-NLP) using batch and column studies. Batch adsorption was performed using different variables like adsorbent dose, temperature and contact duration. Thermodynamic analysis of batch treatment concluded that adsorption is thermodynamically feasible and endothermic. This adsorption followed the Pseudo second-order kinetic model derived from correlation coefficient values of chemical kinetic studies. For column study, interpretation of breakthrough curves and parameters were conducted by varying flow rate, initial concentration and bed height; and reveal that optimum conditions were lower flow rate (5 mL/min) and lower initial concentration (5 mg/L) and higher bed height (20 cm). Comparisons of batch and column study through isotherm models were evaluated and column study is more preferred than batch treatment. Maximum Thomas adsorption capacity was achieved upto 205.6, 185.8, 154.5, 133.3, 120.6, 110.9 mg/g for Pb, Cu, Cd, Zn, Ni and Cr respectively. This removal pattern is elucidated by metal ionic properties. Various adsorbing agents such as acids and bases were utilized for adsorption-desorption of AC-NLP.",

Within the framework of studies on alternative pest management methods, interest has focused on a plethora of plants whose extracts have demonstrated promising action as insecticides. Azadirachta indica and the derived neem oil have been extensively tested against many harmful insect species. In contrast, Cannabis sativa L. and its main compound, CBD, a highly concentrated cannabinoid, have not been investigated much. The present study examined the potential insecticidal activity of CBD and neem oils against 4th instar larvae of Tribolium confusum, Oryzaephilus surinamensis and Plodia interpunctella on wheat, rice and corn seeds. Treatment efficacy was expressed in terms of larval mortality. Mortality was observed in relation to dosage, time exposure intervals and product types. The results showed clear pesticidal activity for both oils, which at high doses induced significant mortality. The treatments produced significantly fewer offspring in the insect species tested than the control. The efficacy of treatment in progeny suppression was, as expected, dose dependent."

Plant extracts, therefore, have been used to improve performance and intestinal health. Here, we conducted a study to evaluate the effects of neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf extracts (NLE) as alternatives to AGPs in broiler chickens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty day-old broiler chicks were assigned to 12-floor pens, each stocked with five birds and divided into three treatment groups of four pens per treatment. The groups were: Negative control, basal diet without additives; positive control, basal diet with antibiotics and vitamins; and NLE treated group, basal diet supplemented with 0.1% aqua extract of neem leaves. RESULTS: Overall feed intake was significantly (p≤0.05) highest in the positive control. Higher body weight, higher dressing percentage, and lower feed conversion ratio were observed in birds treated with NLE compared to the negative control group (p≤0.05) but not the positive control group (p>0.05). There was no significant variation in hematology between different groups. Furthermore, the economic evaluation indicated that the NLE treatment was found cheaper than control and antibiotic treatment in cost-benefit analysis. CONCLUSION: We suggest NLE might be a cheaper alternative to antibiotics in broiler production as indicated by improved body weight and feed efficiency."

The treatment for the severe respiratory illness caused by this virus is primarily symptomatic at this point, although the usage of a broad antiviral drug Remdesivir has been allowed on emergency basis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ever-increasing death toll highlights an urgent need for development of specific antivirals. In this work, we have utilized docking and simulation methods to identify small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) and Envelope (E) proteins, which are essential for virus assembly and budding. A total of 70 compounds from an Indian medicinal plant source (Azadirachta indica or Neem) were virtually screened against these two proteins and further analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations, which resulted in the identification of a few common compounds with strong binding to both structural proteins. The compounds bind to biologically critical regions of M and E, indicating their potential to inhibit the functionality of these components. We hope that our computational approach may result in the identification of effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 assembly.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

In in vivo experiment, 3-days old pre-treated seedlings with both concentrations of neem leaf extract and the highest concentration of commercial product showed a significant reduction in the infection indicating possible systemic effect of neem. When the seedlings were treated following the infection with P. halstedii (i.e., post-treatment), only the highest concentrations of neem leaf extract and the commercial product showed a significant reduction in the infection indicating curative effect of neem.

      "abstract": "Neem Leaf Glycoprotein (NLGP) is a natural immunomodulator, have shown sustained tumor growth restriction as well as angiogenic normalization chiefly by activating CD8+ T cells. Here, we have investigated the direct role of NLGP as a regulator of tumor microenvironmental hypoxia and associated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. We observed a significant reduction in VEGF level in both in vivo murine tumor and in vitro cancer cells (B16Mel, LLC) and macrophages after NLGP treatment. Interestingly, NLGP mediated VEGF downregulation in tumor cells or macrophages within hypoxic chamber was found at an early 4 h and again at late 24 h in mRNA level. Our data suggested that NLGP prevented hypoxia-induced strong binding of HIF1α with its co-factors, CBP/p300 and Sp3, but not with Sp1, which eventually limit the binding of HIF1α-transcriptional complex to hypoxia responsive element of VEGF promoter and results in restricted early VEGF transcription. On the otherhand, suppressed phosphorylation of Stat3 by NLGP results reduction of HIF1α at 24 h of hypoxia that further support sustained VEGF down-regulation. However, NLGP fails to regulate VHL activity as observed by both in vivo and in vitro studies. Therefore, this study for the first time reveals a mechanistic insight of NLGP mediated inhibition of angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF, which might help in vascular normalization to influence better drug delivery."

Neem and clove are known to have antimicrobial properties. AIM: The study aimed at detecting the antibacterial and antifungal activity of neem and clove extract against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Strains of S. mutans and C. albicans and selective media for growing micro-organisms were procured. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using two methods, by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the broth dilution method and determining the zone of inhibition using well diffusion method on mitis salivarius bacitracin selective for S. mutans and Saboraud's dextrose agar plates for C. albicans. One way ANOVA with post hoc analysis was done to compare the antimicrobial activity of extracts and 0.2% chlorhexidine. RESULTS: MIC of neem extract was found to be 4.2 mg/ml and 5.0 mg/ml against S. mutans and C. albicans, respectively. While for cloves, it was 5.5 mg/ml for both. Neem had the highest antibacterial activity with a mean zone of inhibition of 11.4 mm followed by chlorhexidine and cloves whereas antifungal activity was highest for chlorhexidine (14.4 mm) followed by neem and clove. CONCLUSION: The result of the study established that both plant extracts possess antimicrobial activity against common microbes present in the oral cavity."

These were then incorporated into LLDPE by melt blending process to give LLDPE/3ZT-CO/PVA and LLDPE/3ZT-CO/Neem composites. The Neem and PVA stabilized particles showed high zeta potential and dispersed homogeneously in water. The stabilization process altered the shape of the particles due to plane growth along the (002) polar direction. The stabilizers acted as capping agents and initiated the one-dimensional growth. The alkyl chain groups from PVA increased the polarity of the LLDPE/3ZT-CO/PVA and played a dominant role in the water adsorption process to activate the photocatalytic activity. This was further enhanced by the homogeneous distribution of the particles and low degree of crystallinity (20.87%) of the LLDPE composites. LLDPE/3ZT-CO/PVA exhibited the highest photodegradation (93.95%), which was better than the non-stabilized particles. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of a polymer composite can be enhanced by grafting PVA and neem onto couple oxides. The LLDPE/3ZT-CO/PVA composite was further used to treat textile effluent. The results showed the composite was able to remove dye color by 93.95% and to reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) by 99.99%."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The processing and preservation of Irish potato tubers like many other crops has been affected by various pathogens like fungi (particularly storage rot) which causes a major constraint to Irish potato production in Nigeria resulting to enormous post-harvest spoilage. The inhibitory effect of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of neem leaves, stem bark and seeds on fungal rot disease of Solanum tuberosum (Irish potato) as an alternative treatment for fungal storage disease on Irish potato tubers cultivated in Nigeria has been determined in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neem parts were harvested from Wukari, Nigeria and were processed for the experiment. Isolation of fungi and sub-culturing of the isolates was carried out to obtain pure culture. Pathogenicity study was carried out and effect of the plant extracts on mycelia growth of the test fungi was studied using the food poisoning techniques. The qualitative and quantitative phytochemical studies of the neem parts were carried out using standard methods. RESULTS: Qualitative phytochemical screening of the selected parts of neem plant showed the presence of alkaloids, glycoside, flavonoids, carbohydrates, reducing sugar, steroids, tannins and saponins. The quantitative test revealed that the percentage quantity of phytochemicals in these plant parts ranged from 10.17-23.88%. Effect of the extracts on the test organisms was significant (p<0.05). Ethanolic extract of the seed (ESE) exhibited the highest inhibitory effect on Aspergillus niger (88.37%) followed by aqueous extract of stem bark (ABE) (87.21%), while aqueous seed extract (ASE), ethanolic leaves extract (ELE), aqueous leaves extract (ALE) and ethanolic stem bark extract (EBE) exhibited inhibition of 81.78, 77.52, 72.87 and 39.53%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of EBE was significantly (p<0.05) lower than that of other extracts, while there was no significant difference in the inhibitory effects of ESE, ASE and ABE compared to ketoconazole on Aspergillus niger. The ethanolic extracts of the seed and leaves had 100% inhibitory effect on Fusarium oxyporium with 87.60% inhibition by aqueous extract of the leaves. The seed and the leaves ethanolic extracts exhibited the highest inhibitory effects on Pythium spp. and Fusarium oxyporium, while the aqueous leaves extract showed the least inhibition on Fusarium oxyporium. CONCLUSION: The plant extracts in this study were found to be very effective in inhibiting fungal mycelia growth and hence can be potentially effective for preservation during storage of Irish potatoes to minimize post-harvest lost.",

Holoil® was directly applied to skin lesions, while the control group received only standard medication. RESULTS: Application of Holoil® either resulted in crushing and complete resolution of calcium deposits or facilitated sharp excision of calcinosis during wound care sessions in 27/33 cases (81.8%). Complete healing of SU-calc occurred in 15/33 (45%) of cases within a time period of 40.1 ± 16.3 (mean ± SD) days, while 18/33 (55%) of lesions improved in terms of size, erythema, fibrin and calcium deposits. Patients reported a reduction of pain (mean numeric rating scale 7.3 ± 1.9 at baseline versus 2.9 ± 1.4 at follow-up) The control group had longer healing times and a higher percentage of infections.

For what we believe is the first time, that is monitored the efficiency of neem oil (Azadirachta indica) as a repellent against adult Aedes albopictus directly in the field. To test the efficacy of repellency against adults, treatments were performed (5 ml/l) in six different locations. For each location, two closed gardens distance between them 200 m were chosen (one where the treatment was performed, consisting in spraying a mixture of water and Neem oil 5 g/l and one which was used as a control where only water with emulsifier was used). To monitor the treatment efficacy, six ovitraps were used (for each location three for the treated garden and three for the control garden). Data (n° mosquito eggs trapped in each ovitrap) were collected weekly for 6 mo (from May to October) for a total of 900 samplings. Daily temperature and daily rainfall were monitored throughout the trial. The treatment was most effective in June and July. Very high temperatures and high rainfall reduced the efficacy of neem oil over time.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tungiasis is a neglected tropical skin disease caused by the female sand flea (Tunga penetrans), which burrows into the skin causing intense pain, itching and debilitation. People in endemic countries do not have access to an effective and safe home treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a traditionally used and readily available mixture of neem and coconut oil for treatment of tungiasis in coastal Kenya. METHODOLOGY: Ninety-six children aged 6-14 years with at least one embedded viable flea were randomized to be treated with either a mixture of 20% neem (Azadirachta indica) seed oil in coconut oil (NC), or with a 0.05% potassium permanganate (KMnO4) foot bath. Up to two viable fleas were selected for each participant and monitored for 6 days after first treatment using a digital microscope for signs of viability and abnormal development. Acute pathology was assessed on all areas of the feet using a previously established score. Children reported pain levels and itching on a visual scale. RESULTS: The NC was not more effective in killing embedded sand fleas within 7 days than the current standard with KMnO4, killing on average 40% of the embedded sand fleas six days after the initial treatment. However, the NC was superior with respect to the secondary outcomes of abnormal development and reduced pathology. There was a higher odds that fleas rapidly aged in response to NC compared to KMnO4 (OR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.22-9.49, p = 0.019). NC also reduced acute pathology (p<0.005), and there was a higher odds of children being pain free (OR 3.5, p = 0.001) when treated with NC. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst NC did not kill more fleas than KMnO4 within 7 days, secondary outcomes were better and suggest that a higher impact might have been observed at a longer observation period. Further trials are warranted to assess optimal mixtures and dosages. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Scientific and Ethical Review Unit (SERU), Nairobi (Non-SSC Protocol No. 514, 1st April 2016) and approved by and registered with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board's Expert Committee on Clinical Trials PPB/ECCT/16/05/03/2016(94), the authority mandated, by Cap 244 Laws of Kenya, to regulate clinical trials in the country. The trial was also registered with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201901905832601).",

      "abstract": "The brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) is prevalent on canids in Trinidad. It is directly (by causing anaemia) and indirectly (by acting as a vector of tick-borne pathogens) responsible for morbidity and mortalities in the canine population. The most commonly used commercial acaricides available to pet owners in Trinidad are amitraz and fipronil. Often, these acaricides may be abused and misused in a desperate attempt to rid pets of ticks. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of amitraz and fipronil with the herbal alternative, neem (Azadirachta indica). Triplicate in vitro trials utilizing the Larval Packet Test (LPT) were conducted using three concentrations (low, recommended and high) of fipronil (0.025%, 0.05% and 0.1%), amitraz (0.01%, 0.02% and 1%), neem oil (10%, 20% and 40%) and neem leaf extract (0.25%, 0.5% and 2%) for each trial. Statistical analysis using the mixed-effect Poisson regression analysis indicated that there was a significant difference (p < .05) in the survival of ticks pre-treatment versus post-treatment with amitraz, fipronil and all controls when compared to the neem oil. Fipronil and amitraz caused ≥99% mortality for all concentrations used in this study. Mortalities for neem oil and neem leaf extract ranged from 72.7% to 82% and 38% to 95.3%, respectively, with the greatest percentage of mortalities occurring at the lower concentrations. Neem oil and neem leaf extract can be used as alternative acaricides, and however, they are less efficacious against the brown dog tick than amitraz and fipronil.",

      "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a deadly disease that comprises 60% of all head and neck squamous cell cancers. The leaves of the Neem tree (Azadirachta indica) have been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries to treat numerous oral maladies and are known to have significant anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesize that a highly pure super critical CO2 Neem leaf extract (SCNE) prevents initiation and progression of OSCC via downregulation of intra-tumor pro-inflammatory pathways, which promote tumorigenesis. Hence, we investigated the anticancer effects of SCNE using in vitro and in vivo platforms. OSCC cell lines (SCC4, Cal27, and HSC3) were treated with SCNE while inflammation, proliferation, and migration were analyzed over time. SCNE treatment significantly inhibited OSCC cell proliferation and migration and reduced MMP activity in vitro, suggesting its potential to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. The preventive effects of SCNE in ectopic xenograft and 4NQO-1 (4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide) carcinogen-induced mouse models of OSCC were also evaluated. Indeed, xenografted nude mice showed significant reduction of OSCC tumor volumes. Likewise, SCNE significantly reduced the incidence of tongue dysplasia in the 4NQO-1 OSCC initiation model. In both OSCC animal models, SCNE significantly depressed circulating pro-cancer inflammatory cytokines (host and tumor-secreted) including NFkB, COX2, IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ. In addition, we demonstrate that SCNE downregulates STAT3 and AKT expression and activity in vitro. We also demonstrate that the primary active component, nimbolide (NIM), has significant anticancer activity in established OSCC xenografts. Lastly, we show that SCNE induces an M1 phenotype in tumor associated macrophages (TAMS) in vivo. Taken together, these data strongly support SCNE as means of preventing OSCC via downregulation of pro-cancer inflammatory cascades and NIM as a potential new therapy for existing OSCC."

The aim of the present study was to explore a supercritical CO2 extract (SCNE) of neem leaf and a prominent liminoid in neem leaf, nimbolide, for epigenetic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 and HT29) were cultured for 48 h in the presence of neem extract or nimbolide and evaluated for growth inhibition and evidence of suppression of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation. RESULTS: Both SCNE and nimbolide suppressed the proliferation of colon cancer cells by inducing epigenetic modifications.

The cells were grown in 6 well tissue culture plates after treatment with different concentrations of nimbolide and untreated control cells. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were measured using Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide dual staining through a fluorescent microscope and also by staining with annexin V and propidium iodide through flow cytometric analysis. The activity of caspase 3, 8, and 9 was measured by caspases colorimetric assay kits. The number of apoptotic and necrotic cells were significantly higher in all selected cancer cell lines treated with nimbolide as compared with untreated control cells, whereas in normal cell lines no significant difference was observed between nimbolide treated and untreated cells. The activity of caspase 3, 8, and 9 was also significantly higher in all cancer cell lines treated with nimbolide as compared with untreated control cells while it did not change significantly in normal cell lines as compared with untreated control. The results of the present study suggested that nimbolide induced apoptosis only in cancer cells without affecting the normal cells and one of the apoptosis inducing mechanism is through the activation of caspases signaling pathways. Therefore, nimbolide may be a novel promising candidate as an anticancer drug in future."

The study determined the extract concentration that produced the highest efficacy based on the average recorded mean motility time, gross, and microscopic changes of the flukes treated with different concentrations of plant extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study consisted of eight treatments. Every treatment consisted of 10%, 20%, and 40% concentrations of both betel nut extract (BNE) and neem leaf extracts, positive control treatment (Albendazole-treated) and negative control treatment (25 ml nutrient broth). The motility of the flukes on all treatments was based on the established motility criteria scoring. The flukes subjected to all treatments were processed for histopathological analysis. RESULTS: The result of the study revealed that after exposure of Fasciola spp. under 10%, 20%, and 40% extract concentrations, betel nut showed higher efficacy having the recorded mean motility time of 0.22, 0.07 min, and no movement upon contact, respectively, than Albendazole which produced mean motility time of 0.38 min. Nevertheless, the flukes treated with 10%, 20%, and 40% neem leaf extracts obtained the average mean motility time of 220, 151, and 98 min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results gathered showed that 40% BNE concentration showed the highest efficacy based on the recorded mean motility time. All treatments of betel nut extract evidently showed marked changes in the gross and microscopic morphology of the flukes. However, the neem extract was ineffective in all concentrations although changes were observed microscopically. Furthermore, the nutrient broth was proven to be effective as a culture medium since the flukes remained active until 8 h of exposure."

Oils can be polymerized as a polyesteramide to extend their utility as biomaterials. In our studies, we synthesized polyesteramide from neem oil and various compositions of blends were prepared with the drug, chlorohexidine digluconate (CH) to develop a nanomaterial for tissue regeneration. The studies such as cytotoxicity, biodegradable, antibacterial, in vitro drug release, in vivo wound healing, and histopathological studies were performed to identify their potential for tissue regeneration. In vivo wound healing studies of the nanofiber mats with and without CH recorded a faster healing rate as compared to the commercial cream (povidone-iodine). Most importantly, there was no requirement of repeated application of nanofiber mats during the treatment. The histopathology studies also suggested the re-epithelialization of the wounds. Hence, these nanomaterials are considered to be environmentally safe scaffolds for efficient tissue regeneration applications."

For healing myiasis-caused wounds, disinfectant such as creolin is wrongly but currently used in association with insecticides. Though effective, creolin is highly toxic to the patients, is inadequate with respect to the repellent effect, and may delay the healing of treated wounds. In this uncontrolled study, the efficacy of the patented plant-derived formulation 1 Primary Wound Dressing© (1-PWD), composed of neem oil (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) and the oily extract of Hypericum perforatum (L.) flowers, has been investigated. Forty-four domestic animals of different species suffering from wound myiasis lasting for up to 25 days, at different parts of the body, were enrolled in the study. No systemic or local antibiotic or disinfectants' treatment was administered. Larvae recovered on open wounds and adults reared from mature larvae were identified as Wohlfahrtia magnifica. All the treated wounds healed in a range of 10 to 32 days without further infestation. None of the recruited animals presented bacterial complications. Data herein presented indicate that the tested natural plant-derived formulation is able to manage the infestation caused by W. magnifica larvae and the healing process of traumatic infested wounds in several domestic animal species, without any side effect on the living tissue and without the need to use local or systemic chemical or other products.",

      "abstract": "Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a tree from the Meliaceae family native to India, where it is considered as one of the most important plants worldwide. The anticancer effects of neem oil on breast cancer cells have been recently reported; however, its in vivo effects have not been studied. This prompted us to investigate the protective effects of neem oil on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer in high-fat/sucrose-fed Wistar rats. Juvenile female Wistar rats were treated either with neem oil at a dose of 3 mL/kg body weight at 3 different frequencies, 2 times/week (Neem 1), 4 times/week (Neem 2), and every day (Neem 3), or with tamoxifen (3.3 mg/kg body weight), starting 1 week prior to DMBA treatment and lasting 12 weeks. Incidence, burden, volume, and histological analysis of mammary tumors were measured. Further toxicological parameters have been assessed. No tumors were detected in rats from the normal group, while all the rats from the negative control group (100%) developed mammary tumors. The regular consumption of neem oil at a dose of 3 mL/kg (2 or 4 times/week) significantly (p < 0.01) and in a dose-dependent manner reduced tumor incidence (80%), burden [35.78% (2 times/week) and 36.09% (4 times/week)], and weight. Neem consumption protected rats against DMBA-induced breast hyperplasia, with an optimal effect when taken 4 times weekly. Interestingly, all the animals that received a daily dose of 3 mL/kg died at the third week of the experiment. Further, animals that took the neem oil 4 times per week developed hepatotoxicity, evidenced by an increase of liver wet weight, transaminase (ALT and AST) activity, and histological abnormalities in liver. This study brings insight into the use of neem oil, which is greatly appreciated in traditional medicine. In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that the regular consumption of neem oil prevents breast cancer, but its excessive consumption is toxic."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The microspheres are one of the major formulations in the novel drug delivery systems. These days' scientists are predominantly focusing on natural plant products because of the poisonous effect of synthetic drug molecules. From olden days itself, neem has some excellent antibacterial activities. AIMS: The main objective of the research work was to formulate microspheres containing methanolic extract of neem and incorporate it into a gel. The optimized gel was evaluated for its antibacterial activity. METHODS: The methanolic extract of the neem leaves was prepared by maceration process. The microspheres prepared were evaluated for shape, size of particles, and in vitro drug release. Out of all the formulations, the F5 formulation was found to be optimized; therefore, it was incorporated into the gel and evaluated for the in vitro permeation studies, in vivo skin irritation test, in vitro antibacterial activity studies, and accelerated stability studies. RESULTS: The prepared gel formulation showed an acceptable zone of inhibition when compared to the pure drug in in vitro antibacterial activity studies. The skin irritation study on albino Wistar rats showed that the prepared gel formulation was compatible. Based on the stability studies, the gel formulation was found to be stable during the study period. CONCLUSION: The optimized formulation of containing neem extract showed better antibacterial activity, and it could be promising one in the topical delivery of neem for treatment of bacterial infections.",
