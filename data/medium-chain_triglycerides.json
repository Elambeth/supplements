      "abstract": "Presently there has been a growing interest in the development of dietary-based interventions as alternative therapies to combat chronic neurological conditions like epilepsy. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are composed of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone and have shown several beneficial effects in various neurological diseases. The present study investigated MCT supplementation's impact on seizure severity and associated neurobehavioral comorbidities in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) mouse kindling model. Mice were administered 35 mg/kg (i.p.) of PTZ every other day for kindling induction. The kindled mice were then subjected to MCT supplementation for over 25 days with seizure scoring at every 5th day following PTZ exposure. Behavioral analysis was initiated at the end of 25 days of the MCT supplementation. After that, lipid peroxidation assay, and, gene and protein expression studies were performed in the isolated hippocampus. MCT significantly decreased seizure severity scores compared to control. The treatment reduced immobility duration in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, indicating a reversal of seizures-associated depression-like behavior. A significant reduction in the percentage of spontaneous alternation was observed in the kindled control group in the T-maze test, which remained unchanged following MCT supplementation in the treated group. Furthermore, no change was observed in the locomotion and anxiety index of the kindled mice supplemented with MCT compared to the control group. In addition, the supplementation attenuated the altered hippocampal lipid peroxidation, and mRNA and protein levels of mTOR and Gsk-3β. The study concluded that MCT supplementation suppresses epileptic seizures and associated depression-like behavior in kindled mice via interacting mTOR and Gsk-3β signaling.",

      "abstract": "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) have been known to have multiple health benefits in treating metabolic disorders and reducing the incidence of obesity. In the present study, the partial replacement of lard with MCTs assisted by ultrasound treatment on the emulsifying stability and adsorption behavior of myofibrillar protein (MP) was investigated. The results revealed that ultrasound-assisted MCT emulsion had better emulsifying activity and emulsion stability than other groups. MCTs with ultrasound treatment considerably lowered the particle size, facilitated the formation of much smaller and more homogeneous emulsion droplets, and enhanced the oxidative stability of the emulsion. The emulsion had a pseudo-plastic behavior determined through static and dynamic rheological studies, and the MCT emulsion exhibited a larger viscosity and a greater storage modulus (G') compared with the lard emulsion. MCTs could promote protein adsorption levels at the O/W interface, forming a dense interfacial protein film. The surface hydrophobicity and reactive sulfhydryl content increased, accompanied by the transformation of α-helix and β-turn structure to β-sheet and random coil structure, indicating MCTs combined with ultrasound-induced unfolding and crosslinking of MP at the interface. The results suggested that MCTs may have the potential to enhance emulsifying properties in emulsion-type meat products."

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to evaluate effects of MCT and DHA supplementation, alone or in combination, on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. METHODS: A total of 280 MCI participants were randomly assigned to the placebo group, MCT group (14 g/d octanoic acid+10 g/d capric acid), DHA group (800 mg/d) and MCT + DHA (14 g/d octanoic acid, 10 g/d capric acid and 800 mg/d DHA) group, 70 individuals per group for 12 months. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months; blood indicators were analyzed at baseline and 12 months. This study is registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200059641). RESULTS: After 12 months intervention, compared with the placebo group, MCT group, DHA group and MCT + DHA group had statistically significant improvements in full scale IQ (β: 0.107, 95 % CI: 0.006, 0.208; β: 0.135, 95 % CI: 0.034, 0.235; β: 0.136, 95 % CI: 0.035, 0.237), serum total ketone body levels (β: 10.540, 95 % CI: 9.550, 11.531; β: 5.884, 95 % CI: 4.894, 6.875; β: 13.186, 95 % CI: 12.196, 14.176), and decreases in mtDNA deletions (β: -0.370, 95 % CI: -0.648, -0.092; β: -0.335, 95 % CI: -0.613, -0.056; β: -0.427, 95 % CI: -0.705, -0.148) and plasma Aβ42 levels (β: -3.318, 95 % CI: -5.571, -1.064; β: -3.218, 95 % CI: -5.472, -0.965; β: -2.906, 95 % CI: -5.160, -0.653). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of MCT, DHA and their combination for 12 months can significantly improve cognitive function, mitochondria function and increase serum total ketone body levels in MCI individuals. Combined intervention was more beneficial than MCT or DHA alone.",

However, it remains unclear whether the improvement is related to the alterations of gut microbiota and inflammation and the impact of the combined intervention. In this study, we hypothesized that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could modulate gut microbiota, inflammation, and improve cognitive function in APPswe/PS1De9 model mice and senescence-accelerated mouse-prone-8, which are two different mouse models used in neurodegeneration research. The mice were divided into four groups: Control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. The study assessed cognitive function, inflammatory cytokines, and gut microbiota composition. The results showed that supplementation of MCTs + DHA improved spatial learning ability, memory capacity, exploratory behavior; decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria; reduced the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes; decreased the concentrations of serum interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while increasing the concentration of IL-10. Furthermore, supplementation with MCTs + DHA exhibited significantly superior effects compared to MCTs or DHA alone in reducing inflammation, optimizing gut microbiota composition, and improving cognitive function. In conclusion, supplementation with MCTs + DHA improved cognition function, accompanied with favorable alterations in gut microbiota and inflammation in APPswe/PS1De9 and senescence-accelerated mouse-prone-8 mice.",

      "abstract": "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, Cn-3, 22:6) are essential in improving cognitive function and protecting neurocytes. This study explored the effects of the combined intervention of MCTs and DHA on inhibiting neurocyte apoptosis of the brain and improving cognitive function in senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8). Four-month-old male SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups (12 mice/group): DHA, MCT, DHA + MCT, and control groups, which intervened for seven months. Twelve age-matched male senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) was used as the natural aging group. TUNEL assay and HE staining were used to assess neurocyte apoptosis and damage in the brain of mice. Moreover, the cognitive function was analyzed using the Morris water maze (MWM) and open field (OF) tests. The results showed that the cognitive function of 11-month-old SAMP8 mice decreased with age, and further pathological examination revealed the damaged neurocyte structure, karyopyknosis, cell atrophy, and even apoptosis. MCTs combined with DHA supplementation could increase octanoic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), and DHA levels in the serum, inhibit neurocyte apoptosis, improve neurocyte damage, moreover delay age-related cognitive decline after seven-month treatment. Furthermore, combining MCTs and DHA was significantly more beneficial than MCTs or DHA alone. In conclusion, MCTs combined with DHA could delay cognitive decline by inhibiting neurocyte apoptosis of the brain in SAMP8 mice.",

Notably, there is a gap in the distinction between pure MCTs and medium-long-chain triglycerides (MLCTs). METHODS: This meta-analysis investigates the efficacy of MCTs on weight loss and glucolipid metabolism in these populations, explicitly evaluating the differential effects of pure MCTs and MLCTs. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis on relevant studies examining weight loss and glucolipid parameters, incorporating a subgroup analysis conducted based on intervention types, pure MCTs versus MLCTs. RESULTS: Our findings revealed diets enriched with MCTs are more effective in achieving weight reduction (WMD: -1.53%; 95% CI: -2.44, -0.63; p < 0.01), particularly those containing pure MCTs (WMD: -1.62%; 95% CI: -2.78, -0.46; p < 0.01), compared to long-chain fatty acids (LCTs) enriched diets. However, our subgroup analysis indicates that an MLCTs-enriched diet did not significantly reduce weight loss. Additionally, MCTs-enriched diets were associated with significant reductions in blood triglyceride levels and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) scores, compared to LCTs-enriched diets. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, the authors recommend incorporating pure MCTs in dietary interventions for individuals with overweight and obesity, particularly those with comorbidities such as dyslipidemia and impaired glucose metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Pathomechanisms of dementias involve increasing damage to neuronal energy metabolism, resulting in degeneration-related insulin resistance and glucose hypometabolism. In this case, ketone bodies can provide an alternative energy source. Supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which can induce ketogenesis, may alleviate brain energy deficits and improve neuronal function. This review aims to determine the effectiveness of MCT as a symptomatic treatment approach. The systematic literature search was conducted in April 2023 following the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. A total of 21 studies were included, comprising eight uncontrolled trials and 13 RCTs investigating the effects of MCT on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A substantial increase in plasma ketone levels and brain metabolic rates was observed. Cognitive assessments showed only occasional or domain-specific performance improvements. The effects on functional abilities or psychological outcomes have been inadequately studied. Besides gastrointestinal side effects, no harmful effects were observed. However, the evidence was severely weakened by heterogeneous and poorly designed study protocols, bias, and conflicts of interest. In conclusion, the ketogenic properties of MCTs may have beneficial effects on brain metabolism in AD and MCI but do not always result in measurable clinical improvement. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend MCT as a comparable symptomatic treatment option."

It is the most frequent paediatric indication for liver transplantation. The Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) operation is an effective procedure with favourable outcomes when performed before two months of age. The present study aimed to assess the nutritional status of patients with biliary atresia who underwent the Kasai operation and to evaluate the effectiveness of nutritional counselling using medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) formulas and proper supplementation on their nutritional status, growth, and vitamin D levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study included 36 infants with biliary atresia who underwent Kasai portoenterostomy. All patients underwent clinical assessment, anthropometric evaluation, nutritional counselling, and an evaluation of vitamin D levels. Only compliant patients (22/36) were followed up after 3 and 6 months of nutritional counselling. RESULTS: Z-scores for weight, triceps skinfold thickness, and mid-upper arm circumference improved significantly after three months, and the height velocity Z-score improved after six months of nutritional counselling using an MCT-containing formula and supplementations. Patients who showed an improvement in cholestasis had better responses. The initial assessment revealed low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 77.8 %, which increased significantly (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Dietary intervention and supplementation with MCT and micronutrients can improve the nutritional status of children with BA following KPE.",

      "abstract": "Obesity can be associated with significant metabolic disorders. Our previous study found that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) improved lipid metabolism in obese rats. However, scant attention has been given to exploring the impact of MCTs on glucose metabolism in obese rats. This study is designed to examine the effects and mechanisms of three distinct MCTs on glucose metabolism in obese rats. To induce obesity, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a high-fat diet, followed by a 12-week treatment with caprylic triglyceride (CYT), capric triglyceride (CT), and lauric triglyceride (LT). The results showed that three types of MCT intervention reduced the levels of lipids (TC, TG, LDL-c, and HDL-c), hyperglycemia, insulin resistance (insulin, OGTT, HOMA-IR, and ISI), and inflammatory markers (IL-4, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in obese rats (p < 0.01), The above parameters have been minimally improved in the high-fat restoring group (HR) group. MCTs can modulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways to alleviate insulin resistance and improve glucose metabolism in obese rats. Furthermore, MCTs can activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ and reduce the phosphorylation of PPARγser237 mediated by CDK5, which can improve insulin sensitivity without lipid deposition in obese rats. Among the MCT group, CT administration performed the best in the above pathways, with the lowest blood glucose level and insulin resistance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the connection between health benefits and the specific type of MCT employed."

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is projected to be the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and is closely linked to obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Currently, no pharmacological treatments are available to treat NAFLD, and lifestyle modification, including dietary interventions, is the only remedy. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine whether supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), containing a mixture of C8 and C10 (60/40), attenuates NAFLD in obese and insulin-resistant mice. To achieve that, we fed C57BL/6 male mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce obesity and hepatic steatosis, after which obese mice were assigned randomly either to remain on the HFD or to transition to an HFD supplemented with MCTs (HFD + MCTs) or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 6 weeks as another dietary intervention model. Another group of mice was kept on an LFD throughout the study and used as a lean control group. Obese mice that transitioned to HFD + MCTs exhibited improvement in glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and the latter improvement was independent of changes in adiposity when compared with HFD-fed mice. Additionally, supplementation with MCTs significantly reduced hepatic steatosis, improved liver enzymes and decreased hepatic expression of inflammation-related genes to levels similar to those observed in obese mice transitioned to an LFD. Importantly, HFD + MCTs markedly lowered hepatic ceramide and diacylglycerol content and prevented protein kinase C-ε translocation to the plasma membrane. Our study demonstrated that supplementation with MCTs formulated mainly from C8 and C10 effectively ameliorated NAFLD in obese mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Three clinical trials have examined the chronic effects of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) on muscle mass and function in frail older adults (mean age 85 years old). However, significant increases in muscle mass and some muscle function relative to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) have yet to be shown, possibly due to the small number of participants in each trial. OBJECTIVE: We re-analyzed these previous clinical trials to clarify whether MCT supplementation can increase muscle mass and function. ANALYSIS: After adding post hoc tests to the original report, we compared changes in measurement between the MCT and LCT groups in the first 2 trials and conducted a combined data analysis. METHODS: In a combined data analysis, changes from baseline in measurements at the 3 months intervention in the MCTs- and LCTs-containing groups were assessed by analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values of each measurement, age, sex, BMI, allocation to trial, habitual intakes in energy, protein, leucine, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, and vitamin D during the baseline period. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze data on right and left knee extension times. RESULTS: MCT supplementation for 3 months increased muscle function relative to LCT supplementation with and without an L-leucine (1.2 g) and vitamin D (cholecalciferol, 20 μg)-enriched supplement. In a combined data analysis (n = 29 in MCTs, n = 27 in LCTs), relative to supplementation with 6 g LCTs/day, supplementation with 6 g MCTs/day at dinner for 3 months significantly increased body weight (adjusted mean change from baseline: MCTs 1.2 vs. LCTs 0.2 kg, p = 0.023), right arm muscle area (MCTs 1.4 vs. LCTs-0.7 cm2, p = 0.002), left calf circumference (p = 0.015), right-hand grip strength (MCTs 1.6 vs. LCTs 0.3 kg, p = 0.017), right knee extension time (p = 0.021), left knee extension time (p = 0.034), walking speed (p = 0.002), and number of iterations in leg open and close test (p < 0.001) and decreased right triceps skinfold thickness (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: In frail older adults, supplementation for 3 months with a low dose (6 g/day) of MCTs (C8:0 and C10:0) increased muscle mass and function. These findings indicate the potential for the practical use of MCTs in daily life in treating sarcopenia."

      "abstract": "The deterioration of brain glucose metabolism predates the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) positively improve brain glucose metabolism and decrease the expression of AD-related proteins. However, the effects of the combined intervention are unclear. The present study explored the effects of the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA in improving brain glucose metabolism and decreasing AD-related protein expression levels in APP/PS1 mice. The mice were assigned into four dietary treatment groups: the control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. The corresponding diet of the respective groups was fed to mice from the age of 3 to 11 months. The results showed that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could increase serum octanoic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), DHA, and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) levels; improve glucose metabolism; and reduce nerve cell apoptosis in the brain. Moreover, it also aided with decreasing the expression levels of amyloid beta protein (Aβ), amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1) in the brain. Furthermore, the supplementation of MCTs + DHA was significantly more beneficial than that of MCTs or DHA alone. In conclusion, the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could improve energy metabolism in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, thus decreasing nerve cell apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of Aβ.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets, such as ketogenic diets, for cancer patients is of research interest. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in a case study in which medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) or MCT-containing formula (ketogenic formula) was used as a supplement to increase blood ketone bodies. However, little is known about the amounts needed to induce ketogenic effects and about the usefulness of monitoring of breath acetone. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of MCTs and their metabolites, blood ketone bodies and breath acetone, 24 healthy subjects received one of four single oral doses of the ketogenic formula (equivalent to 0, 10, 20, and 30 g of MCTs) under fasting conditions. Total blood ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate, octanoic acid, and decanoic acid were increased in a dose-dependent manner. The ketogenic effect was considered to depend on octanoic and decanoic acids, because a positive correlation was observed between them. A strong positive correlation was also observed between total serum ketone bodies and breath acetone at each time points. Therefore, monitoring breath acetone levels seems a less invasive method to predict blood concentrations of ketone bodies during ketogenic diet therapy.

      "abstract": "Cytotoxicity (i.e. cell death) is the core mechanism by which chemotherapy induces its anti-cancer effects. Unfortunately, this same mechanism underpins the collateral damage it causes to healthy tissues. The gastrointestinal tract is highly susceptible to chemotherapy's cytotoxicity, resulting in ulcerative lesions (termed gastrointestinal mucositis, GI-M) that impair the functional capacity of the gut leading to diarrhea, anorexia, malnutrition and weight loss, which negatively impact physical/psychological wellbeing and treatment adherence. Preventing these side effects has proven challenging given the overlapping mechanisms that dictate chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity. Here, we report on a novel dietary intervention that, due to its localized gastrointestinal effects, is able to protect the intestinal mucosal from unwanted toxicity without impairing the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy. The test diet (containing extensively hydrolyzed whey protein and medium chain triglycerides (MCTs)), was investigated in both tumor-naïve and tumor-bearing models to evaluate its effect on GI-M and chemo-efficacy, respectively. In both models, methotrexate was used as the representative chemotherapeutic agent and the diet was provided ad libitum for 14 days prior to treatment. GI-M was measured using the validated biomarker plasma citrulline, and chemo-efficacy defined by tumor burden (cm3/g body weight). The test diet significantly attenuated GI-M (P = 0.03), with associated reductions in diarrhea (P < 0.0001), weight loss (P < 0.05), daily activity (P < 0.02) and maintenance of body composition (P < 0.02). Moreover, the test diet showed significant impact on gut microbiota by increasing diversity and resilience, whilst also altering microbial composition and function (indicated by cecal short and brained chain fatty acids). The test diet did not impair the efficacy of methotrexate against mammary adenocarcinoma (tumor) cells. In line with the first model, the test diet minimized intestinal injury (P = 0.001) and diarrhea (P < 0.0001). These data support translational initiatives to determine the clinical feasibility, utility and efficacy of this diet to improve chemotherapy treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Reverse transcription followed by quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has become the gold standard in mRNA expression analysis. However, it requires an accurate choice of reference genes for adequate normalization. The aim of this study was to validate the reference genes for qPCR experiments in the brain of rats in the model of mild ketosis established through supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and intermittent fasting. This approach allows to reproduce certain neuroprotective effects of the classical ketogenic diet while avoiding its adverse effects. Ketogenic treatment targets multiple metabolic pathways, which may affect the reference gene expression. The standard chow of adult Wistar rats was supplemented with MCT (2 ml/kg orogastrically, during 6 h of fasting) or water (equivolume) for 1 month. The mRNA expression of 9 housekeeping genes (Actb, B2m, Gapdh, Hprt1, Pgk1, Ppia, Rpl13a, Sdha, Ywhaz) in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus was measured by RT-qPCR. Using the RefFinder® online tool, we have found that the reference gene stability ranking strongly depended on the analyzed brain region. The most stably expressed reference genes were found to be Ppia, Actb, and Rpl13a in the medial prefrontal cortex; Rpl13a, Ywhaz, and Pgk1 in the dorsal hippocampus; Ywhaz, Sdha, and Ppia in the ventral hippocampus. The B2m was identified as an invalid reference gene in the ventral hippocampus, while Sdha, Actb, and Gapdh were unstable in the dorsal hippocampus. The stabilities of the examined reference genes were lower in the dorsal hippocampus compared to the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. When normalized to the three most stably expressed reference genes, the Gapdh mRNA was upregulated, while the Sdha mRNA was downregulated in the medial prefrontal cortex of MCT-fed animals. Thus, the expression stability of reference genes strongly depends on the examined brain regions. The dorsal and ventral hippocampal areas differ in reference genes stability rankings, which should be taken into account in the RT-qPCR experimental design.",

Each group was fed an isocaloric milk formula containing either 0% or 0.35% clofibrate (wt/wt, dry matter basis) with 5% SUC, T2M, TC5 or TC6 for 5 d. Another 6 pigs served as newborn controls. Fatty acid oxidation was examined in fresh homogenates of liver collected on d 6 using [1-14C] palmitic acid (1 mM) as a substrate (0.265 μCi/μmol). Measurements were performed in the absence or presence of L-carnitine (1 mM) or inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (L659699, 1.6 μM) or acetoacetate-CoA deacylase (iodoacetamide, 50 μM). Without clofibrate stimulation, 14C accumulation in CO2 was higher from piglets fed diets containing T2M and TC5 than SUC, but similar to those fed TC6. Under clofibrate stimulation, accumulation also was higher in homogenates from piglets fed TC5 than all other dietary treatments. Interactions between clofibrate and carnitine or the inhibitors were observed (P = 0.0004) for acid soluble products (ASP). In vitro addition of carnitine increased 14C-ASP (P < 0.0001) above all other treatments, regardless of clofibrate treatment. The percentage of 14C in CO2 was higher (P = 0.0023) in TC5 than in the control group. From these results we suggest that dietary supplementation of anaplerotic and ketogenic FA could impact FA oxidation and modify the metabolism of acetyl-CoA (product of β-oxidation) via alteration of TCA cycle activity, but the modification has no significant impact on the hepatic FA oxidative capacity induced by PPARα. In addition, the availability of carnitine is a critical element to maintain FA oxidation during the neonatal period."

Exogenous medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation may induce nutritional ketosis. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the effects of MCTs on memory function in older adults without cognitive impairment. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science was employed from inception until April 2022 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, investigating the impact of MCT oils on components of memory. Risk of bias (RoB2) tool was utilized for quality assessment. RESULTS: Six trials were included for qualitative synthesis, in which two studies examined the effect of MCTs through a ketogenic meal. MCT supplementation compared to controls was associated with improved indices of memory function in 4 out of 6 studies, particularly working memory. A meta-analysis was not employed due to the low number of studies, therefore, a true effect measure of MCT supplementation was not explored. CONCLUSIONS: MCT supplementation may enhance working memory in non-demented older adults. These effects may be more prominent in individuals with lower baseline scores, from short and long-term supplementation. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings in terms of optimal dose and MCTs composition, which may protect from memory decline during aging.",

      "abstract": "It is now widely accepted that ketosis (a physiological state characterized by elevated plasma ketone body levels) possesses a wide range of neuroprotective effects. There is a growing interest in the use of ketogenic supplements, including medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), to achieve intermittent ketosis without adhering to a strict ketogenic diet. MCT supplementation is an inexpensive and simple ketogenic intervention, proven to benefit both individuals with normal cognition and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other cognitive disorders. The commonly accepted paradigm underlying MCT supplementation trials is that the benefits stem from ketogenesis and that MCT supplementation is safe. However, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) may also exert effects in the brain directly. Moreover, MCFAs, long-chain fatty acids, and glucose participate in mutually intertwined metabolic pathways. Therefore, the metabolic effects must be considered if the desired procognitive effects require administering MCT in doses larger than 1 g/kg. This review summarizes currently available research on the procognitive effects of using MCTs as a supplement to regular feed/diet without concomitant reduction of carbohydrate intake and focuses on the revealed mechanisms linked to particular MCT metabolites (ketone bodies, MCFAs), highlighting open questions and potential considerations."

It is reported that medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) can improve immune status and alter the gut microflora. This study investigates MCT effects on immune status and gut microbiota among tunnel workers. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Forty-five workers were randomly divided into an MCT group (n=30) and control group (n=15), where they ingested MCT-milk or a placebo milk for 12 weeks, respectively. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of respiratory infection and diarrhea. Secondary outcomes were changes in serum immune-related markers and changes in gut microbiota. RESULTS: The incidence of diarrhea in MCT group was significantly decreased after 4 weeks (p<0.01), with no significant differences in the control group. MCT reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, CRP, and IL-6) and enhanced the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, C3, C4, IgA, IgG, and IgM), respectively (p<0.01). The Chao index was reduced (p<0.01) and microbiota composition changed significantly after 12 weeks of MCT intervention. MCT reduced the abundance of Bacteroides, Roseburia, Ruminococcus_1, Lachnospira and increased that of Blautia and Fusicatenibacter at the genus level (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of MCT reduces diarrhea occurrence and improves serum immune profiles together with gut microbiomics in tunnel workers.",

      "abstract": "In the 1950s, the production of processed fats and oils from coconut oil was popular in the United States. It became necessary to find uses for the medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) that were byproducts of the process, and a production method for medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) was established. At the time of this development, its use as a non-fattening fat was being studied. In the early days MCFAs included fatty acids ranging from hexanoic acid (C6:0) to dodecanoic acid (C12:0), but today their compositions vary among manufacturers and there seems to be no clear definition. MCFAs are more polar than long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) because of their shorter chain length, and their hydrolysis and absorption properties differ greatly. These differences in physical properties have led, since the 1960s, to the use of MCTs to improve various lipid absorption disorders and malnutrition. More than half a century has passed since MCTs were first used in the medical field. It has been reported that they not only have properties as an energy source, but also have various physiological effects, such as effects on fat and protein metabolism. The enhancement of fat oxidation through ingestion of MCTs has led to interest in the study of body fat reduction and improvement of endurance during exercise. Recently, MCTs have also been shown to promote protein anabolism and inhibit catabolism, and applied research has been conducted into the prevention of frailty in the elderly. In addition, a relatively large ingestion of MCTs can be partially converted into ketone bodies, which can be used as a component of \"ketone diets\" in the dietary treatment of patients with intractable epilepsy, or in the nutritional support of terminally ill cancer patients. The possibility of improving cognitive function in dementia patients and mild cognitive impairment is also being studied. Obesity due to over-nutrition and lack of exercise, and frailty due to under-nutrition and aging, are major health issues in today's society. MCTs have been studied in relation to these concerns. In this paper we will introduce the results of applied research into the use of MCTs by healthy subjects."

      "abstract": "Nutritional supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) has the potential to increase memory function in elderly patients with frailty and dementia. Our aim was to investigate the effects of MCT on cognitive and gait functions and their relationships with focal brain metabolism and functional connectivity even in healthy older adults. Participants were blindly randomized and allocated to two groups: 18 g/day of MCT oil and matching placebo formula (control) administered as a jelly stick (6 g/pack, ingested three times a day). Gait analysis during the 6-m walk test, cognition, brain focal glucose metabolism quantified by 18F-fluorodeocyglucose positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging-based functional connectivity were assessed before and after a 3-month intervention. Sixty-three healthy, normal adults (females and males) were included. Compared with the control group, the MCT group showed better balance ability, as represented by the lower Lissajous index (23.1 ± 14.4 vs. 31.3 ± 18.9; P < 0.01), although no time × group interaction was observed in cognitive and other gait parameters. Moreover, MCT led to suppressed glucose metabolism in the right sensorimotor cortex compared with the control (P < 0.001), which was related to improved balance (r = 0.37; P = 0.04) along with increased functional connectivity from the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. In conclusion, a 3-month MCT supplementation improves walking balance by suppressing glucose metabolism, which suggests the involvement of the cerebro-cerebellar network. This may reflect, at least in part, the inverse reaction of the ketogenic switch as a beneficial effect of long-term MCT dietary treatment.",

However, ketogenic diets are often not standardized and, therefore, results are difficult to interpret. We previously investigated the usefulness of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy, where ketogenic formulas (KF) were used as supplements to enhance blood ketone bodies; however, the amount of KF was determined empirically with reference to blood ketone bodies levels. Here, to determine a standardized optimal amount of KF, we investigated temporal changes in blood ketone bodies (acetoacetic acid (AcAc), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)) and safety in 20 healthy individuals when KF was taken repeatedly under the conditions of a ketogenic diet (UMIN000034216). The diurnal variation in total ketone bodies, and AcAc and BHB levels significantly increased after lunch and after dinner, on the 4th day of KF administration. There were no significant safety issues related to KF in the context of anthropometric, metabolic, nutritional, urological and gastrointestinal parameters. In addition, ketogenic diets lead to changes in gut microbiota. KF showed a decrease in phylum Firmicutes. Our study provides baseline data of the usefulness of KF in a ketogenic diet.",

However, suitable timing of MCT supplementation during the day is unknown. DESIGN: We enrolled 40 elderly nursing home residents (85.9 ± 7.7 years) in a 1.5-month randomized intervention trial. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups: one received 6 g/day of MCTs at breakfast (breakfast group) as a test group and the other at dinnertime (dinner group) as a positive control group. MEASUREMENTS: Muscle mass, strength, function, and cognition were monitored at baseline and 1.5 months after initiation of intervention. RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants completed the study and were included in the analysis. MCT supplementation in breakfast and dinner groups respectively increased right arm muscle area from baseline by 1.1 ± 0.8 cm2 (P<0.001) and 1.6 ± 2.5 cm2 (P<0.001), left arm muscle area by 1.1 ± 0.7 cm2 (P<0.001) and 0.9 ± 1.0 cm2 (P<0.01), right knee extension time by 39 ± 42 s (P<0.01) and 20 ± 32 s (P<0.05), leg open and close test time by 1.74 ± 2.00 n/10 s (P<0.01) and 1.67 ± 2.01 n/10 s (P<0.01), and Mini-Mental State Examination score by 1.5 ± 3.0 points (P=0.06) and 1.0 ± 2.1 points (P=0.06). These increases between two groups did not differ statistically significantly. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with 6 g MCTs/day for 1.5 months, irrespective of ingestion at breakfast or dinnertime, could increase muscle mass and function, and cognition in frail elderly adults.",

      "abstract": "This prospective open-label feasibility study aimed to evaluate acceptability, tolerability and compliance with dietary intervention with K.Vita, a medical food containing a unique ratio of decanoic acid to octanoic acid, in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy. Adults and children aged 3-18 years with drug-resistant epilepsy took K.Vita daily whilst limiting high-refined sugar food and beverages. K.Vita was introduced incrementally with the aim of achieving ≤35% energy requirements for children or 240 ml for adults. Primary outcome measures were assessed by study completion, participant diary, acceptability questionnaire and K.Vita intake. Reduction in seizures or paroxysmal events was a secondary outcome. 23/35 (66%) children and 18/26 (69%) adults completed the study; completion rates were higher when K.Vita was introduced more gradually. Gastrointestinal disturbances were the primary reason for discontinuation, but symptoms were similar to those reported from ketogenic diets and incidence decreased over time. At least three-quarters of participants/caregivers reported favourably on sensory attributes of K.Vita, such as taste, texture and appearance, and ease of use. Adults achieved a median intake of 240 ml K.Vita, and children 120 ml (19% daily energy). Three children and one adult had ß-hydroxybutyrate >1 mmol/l. There was 50% (95% CI 39-61%) reduction in mean frequency of seizures/events. Reduction in seizures or paroxysmal events correlated significantly with blood concentrations of medium chain fatty acids (C10 and C8) but not ß-hydroxybutyrate. K.Vita was well accepted and tolerated. Side effects were mild and resolved with dietetic support. Individuals who completed the study complied with K.Vita and additional dietary modifications. Dietary intervention had a beneficial effect on frequency of seizures or paroxysmal events, despite absent or very low levels of ketosis. We suggest that K.Vita may be valuable to those with drug-resistant epilepsy, particularly those who cannot tolerate or do not have access to ketogenic diets, and may allow for more liberal dietary intake compared to ketogenic diets, with mechanisms of action perhaps unrelated to ketosis. Further studies of effectiveness of K.Vita are warranted."

      "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an intractable genetic disease associated with progressive skeletal muscle weakness and degeneration. Recently, it was reported that intraperitoneal injections of ketone bodies partially ameliorated muscular dystrophy by increasing satellite cell (SC) proliferation. Here, we evaluated whether a ketogenic diet (KD) with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-KD) could alter genetically mutated DMD in model rats. We found that the MCT-KD significantly increased muscle strength and fiber diameter in these rats. The MCT-KD significantly suppressed the key features of DMD, namely, muscle necrosis, inflammation, and subsequent fibrosis. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the MCT-KD promoted the proliferation of muscle SCs, suggesting enhanced muscle regeneration. The muscle strength of DMD model rats fed with MCT-KD was significantly improved even at the age of 9 months. Our findings suggested that the MCT-KD ameliorates muscular dystrophy by inhibiting myonecrosis and promoting the proliferation of muscle SCs. As far as we can ascertain, this is the first study to apply a functional diet as therapy for DMD in experimental animals. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the MCT-KD-induced improvement of DMD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ketone bodies are a highly relevant topic in nutrition and medicine. The influence of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) on ketogenesis is well known and has been successfully used in ketogenic diets for many years. Nevertheless, the effects of MCTs and coconut oil on the production of ketone bodies have only partially been investigated. Furthermore, the increased mobilisation of free fatty acids and release of catabolic hormones by caffeine suggest an influence of caffeine on ketogenesis. METHODS: In a controlled, double-blind intervention study, seven young healthy subjects received 10 mL of tricaprylin (C8), tricaprin (C10), C8/C10 (50% C8, 50% C10), or coconut oil with or without 150 mg of caffeine, in 250 mL of decaffeinated coffee, over ten interventions. At baseline and after every 40 minutes, for 4 h, ßHB and glucose in capillary blood as well as caffeine in saliva were measured. Furthermore, questionnaires were used to survey sensory properties, side effects, and awareness of hunger and satiety. RESULTS: The interventions with caffeine caused an increase in ßHB levels-in particular, the interventions with C8 highly impacted ketogenesis. The effect decreased with increased chain lengths. All interventions showed a continuous increase in hunger and diminishing satiety. Mild side effects (total = 12) occurred during the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated an influence of caffeine and MCT on ketogenesis. The addition of caffeine showed an additive effect on the ketogenic potential of MCT and coconut oil. C8 showed the highest ketogenicity."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether adding a medium chain triglyceride emulsion to MAD to target catamenial seizures was feasible and well-tolerated. This was a prospective two-center study of pre-menopausal WWE with a catamenial seizure pattern on MAD. After a 1-month baseline interval with no changes in treatment, participants consumed betaquik® (Vitaflo International Ltd.) for 10 days each menstrual cycle starting 2 days prior to and encompassing the primary catamenial seizure pattern for five cycles. Participants recorded seizures, ketones, and menses, and completed surveys measuring tolerability. Sixteen women aged 20-50 years (mean 32) were enrolled and 13 (81.2%) completed the study. There was 100% adherence for consuming betaquik® in the women who completed the study and overall intervention adherence rate including the participants that dropped out was 81.2%. The most common side effects attributed to MAD alone prior to starting betaquik® were constipation and nausea, whereas abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea were reported after adding betaquik®. The high adherence rate and acceptable tolerability of betaquik® shows feasibility for future studies evaluating KDT-based treatments for catamenial seizures.",

      "abstract": "Many studies show that glucose metabolism in epileptic brain areas can be impaired. Energy is crucial to maintain normal brain function, including ion and neurotransmitter balances. Energy deficits can lead to disruption of ion gradients, which can trigger neuronal depolarization and generation of seizures. Thus, perturbed metabolic processing of glucose in epileptogenic brain areas indicates a specific nutritional need for people and animals with epilepsy, as they are likely to benefit from auxiliary brain fuels other than glucose. Ketogenic diets provide the ketone bodies acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, which can be used as auxiliary fuel by the brain. In approximately 50% children and adults with certain types of epilepsy, who can tolerate and maintain these dietary regimens, seizure frequency can be effectively reduced. More recent data demonstrate that addition of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), which provide the medium chain fatty acids octanoic and decanoic acid, as well as ketone bodies as auxiliary brain energy, can be beneficial in rodent seizure models, and dogs and humans with epilepsy. Here, this evidence is reviewed, including tolerance in 65% of humans, efficacy studies in dogs, possible anticonvulsant mechanisms of actions of MCTs, and specifically decanoic acid as well as metabolic and antioxidant mechanisms. In conclusion, MCTs are a promising adjunct to standard pharmacological treatment for both humans and dogs with epilepsy, as they lack central nervous system side effects found with current antiepileptic drugs. There is now a need for larger clinical trials in children, adults, and dogs to find the ideal composition and doses of MCTs and the types of epilepsy that respond best.",

Works over the last decades have provided evidence of the therapeutic potential of the ketogenic diet (KD). This review focus on mainly clinical research on the effectiveness of the KD and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) supplementation in ameliorating the severity of symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD). RECENT FINDINGS: A limited number of clinical studies (short-time and with a small number of participants) evaluated the role of the KD and MCT supplementation in AD as a potential dietary intervention in the therapy of this disease. These studies report that the application of KD or/and MCT supplements to older people reduces symptoms of AD. MCT supplements allow achieving an increased level of KBs in the blood even with a greater supply of carbohydrates in the diet and without any drastic changes in the habitual diet of patients. SUMMARY: The recent literature highlights the potential benefit of using diet-induced ketosis as an additional element of therapy in AD. Since persons with AD are at risk of malnutrition, the use of KD raises certain concerns due to side effects, especially for long periods of time. MCT supplements to obtain similar clinical results without the need for drastic changes in the diet of patients.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairments (CI) have recently been identified in canine epilepsy patients. A medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) enriched diet has been demonstrated to improve cognition in aged dogs and seizure control in canine epilepsy. This study evaluates the short-term effects of MCT-oil consumption on cognitive abilities in dogs with epilepsy, a naturally occurring animal model. METHODS: A 6-month multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled cross-over diet trial was conducted comparing dietary supplementation (DS) of MCT oil to a control oil. Allocation to dietary oil supplements, consisting of 9% total caloric intake, was block-randomized and supplemented into each dogs' diet for 3 months followed by a respective switch of DS-oil for a further 3 months. Noninvasive cognitive tests and a validated psychometric tool were utilized to evaluate cognitive function and perturbations associated with dietary intervention. RESULTS: Twenty-nine dogs completed the trial, of which 18 completed noninvasive cognitive testing. Spatial-working memory (P = 0.008), problem-solving ability (P = 0.048), and owner-reported trainability (P = 0.041) were significantly improved during MCT-oil supplementation compared to control-DS. SIGNIFICANCE: MCT-oil DS improves cognition in dogs with epilepsy when compared to a control-DS. MCT supplementation may represent a promising option to address CI associated with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation is often recommended as treatment for patients with long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation (lcFAO) disorders, since they can be utilized as an energy source without the use of the defective enzyme. However, studies in mice and preterm infants suggest that not all medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are oxidized and may undergo elongation to long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). In this single blinded study, we explored the metabolic fates of MCT in healthy individuals using a 13C-labeled MCT tracer. METHOD: Three healthy males in rest received on two test days a primed continuous infusion of glyceryl tri[1,2,3,4-13C4]-octanoate with either an isocaloric supplementation of 1) exclusively MCT (MCT-only) or 2) a mixture of MCT, proteins and carbohydrates (MCT-mix). Gas chromatography - combustion - isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) was used to determine 13C-enrichment of long-chain fatty acids in plasma and of 13CO2 in exhaled air. RESULTS: When provided as single energy source, an estimated 42% of administered MCT was converted to CO2. In combination with carbohydrates and proteins in the diet, oxidation of MCT was higher (62%). In both diets <1% of 13C-label was incorporated in LCFA in plasma, indicating that administered MCT underwent chain-elongation to LCT. CONCLUSIONS: Although the relative MCT oxidation rate was higher when combined with carbohydrates and protein, quantitatively more MCT was oxidized when given an isocaloric meal with solely MCT. As these results were obtained in the resting state opposed to during exercise, it is too early to give a recommendation concerning the use of MCT in lcFAO disorders. The data show that in resting healthy individuals only a very small part of the MCT is traced back as LCFA in plasma, suggesting that MCT treatment does not result in a large LCFA burden, however further research on storage of MCT in tissues is warranted.

Participants were randomly allocated to 3 groups: the first group received supplemental L-leucine (1.2 g) and cholecalciferol (20 μg) enriched with 6 g/d of MCTs (LD + MCT group) as a positive control, the second group received 6 g/d of MCTs (MCT group) as the test nutrient, and the third group received 6 g/d of long-chain triglycerides (LCT group) as a negative control. Cognition (secondary outcome) was monitored 4 times: baseline, 1.5 and 3 mo after initiation of the intervention (intervention), and 1.5 mo after termination of the intervention (postintervention follow-up). Cognition scores were assessed by a linear mixed model (intention-to-treat analysis). RESULTS: MCT supplementation increased the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score by 3.5 points at the 3-mo intervention from baseline (P < 0.001) [intention-to-treat adjusted means: baseline 17.5 points (95% CI: 14.9, 20.2), 3-mo intervention 21.0 points (18.3, 23.7)], whereas LCT supplementation decreased the MMSE score by -0.7 points [baseline 17.0 points (95% CI: 14.4, 19.6), 3-mo intervention 16.3 points (13.6, 18.9)]. At the 3-mo intervention, the difference in MMSE score between the MCT (21.0 points) and LCT (16.3 points) groups became significant (P < 0.05). The increase in MMSE score in response to MCTs was 2.1-fold greater at 3 mo than at 1.5 mo and had returned to baseline value at the 4.5-mo postintervention follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with 6 g MCTs/d may improve the cognition of frail elderly individuals. This trial was registered at umin.ac.jp as UMIN000023302.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Currently, there is no effective medication for the prevention or treatment of AD. This has led to the search for alternative therapeutic strategies. Coconut oil(CO) has a unique fatty acid composition that is rich in medium chain fatty acids(MCFA), a major portion of which directly reaches the liver via the portal vein, thereby bypassing the lymphatic system. Given that brain glucose hypometabolism is a major early hallmark of AD, detectable well before the onset of symptoms, ketone bodies from MCFA metabolism can potentially serve as an alternative energy source to compensate for lack of glucose utilisation in the brain. Additionally, neuroprotective antioxidant properties of CO have been attributed to its polyphenolic content. This review discusses how the metabolism of CO and MCFA may aid in compensating the glucose hypometabolism observed in the AD brain. Furthermore, we present the current evidence of the neuroprotective properties of CO on cognition, amyloid-β pathogenicity, inflammation and oxidative stress. The current review addresses the influence of CO/MCFA on other chronic disorders that are risk factors for AD, and addresses existing gaps in the literature regarding the use of CO/MCFA as a potential treatment for AD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) have unique metabolic properties which may improve insulin sensitivity (Si) and beta cell function but data in humans are limited. We conducted a 6-week clinical trial of MCT oil supplementation. METHODS: 22 subjects without diabetes (8 males, 14 females, mean ± standard error age 39±2.9 years, baseline BMI 27.0±1.4 kg/m2) were counseled to maintain their body weight and physical activity (PA) during the trial. Dietary intake, PA data, body composition, and resting energy expenditure (REE) were obtained through dietary recall, international PA questionnaire, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and indirect calorimetry, respectively. MCT prescriptions were given based on REE and PA to replace part of dietary fat with 30 grams of MCT per 2000 kcal daily. Insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after MCT to measure changes in Si, acute insulin response (AIR), disposition index (DI), and glucose effectiveness (Sg). RESULTS: MCT were well tolerated and weight remained stable (mean change 0.3 kg, p = 0.39). Fasting REE, respiratory quotient, and body composition were stable during the intervention. There were no significant changes in mean fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, fasting total ketones, Si, AIR, DI, Sg, leptin, fructosamine, and proinsulin. The mean change in Si was 0.5 10-4 min-1 per mU/L (95% CI: -1.4, 2.4), corresponding to a 12% increase from baseline, and the range was -4.7 to 12.9 10-4 min-1 per mU/L. Mean total adiponectin decreased significantly from 22925 ng/mL at baseline to 17598 ng/mL at final visit (p = 0.02). The baseline clinical and laboratory parameters were not significantly associated with the change in Si. DISCUSSION: There were a wide range of changes in the minimal model parameters of glucose and insulin metabolism in subjects following 6 weeks of MCT as an isocaloric substitution for part of usual dietary fat intake. Since this was a single-arm non-randomized study without a control group, it cannot be certain whether these changes were due to MCT so further randomized controlled trials are warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous clinical and animal studies suggested that medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) might be an alternative energy substrate for the brain and might benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the clinical evidence is not substantial or totally convincing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of MCT on cognitive ability in patients with mild to moderate AD and explore the changes in peripheral blood metabolomics. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study was undertaken in 53 mild to moderate AD patients. Participants were randomized between two sequences (placebo followed by MCT or MCT followed by placebo) and took MCT jelly or placebo jelly (canola oil) by mouth three times daily (total daily fat dose: 17.3 g MCT, or 19.7 g canola oil) for 30 days per phase. The primary outcome was cognition as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Chinese version (ADAS-Cog-C). The secondary outcome was self-care as measured by the activities of daily living scale (ADL) and changes in plasma metabolites. RESULTS: This study showed a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in ADAS-Cog-C scores between the MCT (2.62 points below baseline) and placebo interventions (2.57 points above baseline). Data from 46 (86.8%) APOE4-/- subjects who completed the entire study were analyzed. Changes in ADL scores were not significantly different between the MCT and placebo interventions (p > 0.05). The concentrations of TC, HDL-C, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were significantly higher in the MCT group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0 (LysoPC (16:0)), LysoPC (P-18:0), LysoPC (P-18:1(9Z)), LysoPC (20:2(11Z,14Z)), and LysoPC (22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)) were significantly increased after MCT intervention, and the concentrations of LysoPC (18:0), palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), whereas no significant changes appeared after the placebo intervention. Androstenedione concentration increased after placebo intervention. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between changes in LysoPC (P-18:1(9Z)) and ADAS-Cog-C scores after MCT intervention (r = -0.1472, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MCT had positive effects on cognitive ability in mild to moderate AD patients with APOE4-/-. These effects of MCT might be related to the metabolism of LysoPC, oleic acid, linoleic acid and palmitic acid, in addition to the ketogenic effect. STUDY ID NUMBER: ChiCTR-IOR-16009737.

All three treatments resulted in a significant increase in D-BHB, HDL-c, and TC as well as a significant decrease in TAG, MDA, H2O2, and insulin. The 42 g treatment was associated with significantly higher levels of AOPP and MDA.

Five-day MCT treatment increased endogenous acyl ghrelin (p = 0.0049), but the total ghrelin level was unchanged. MCT-ghrelin combination treatment improved the peak oxygen uptake (p = 0.0120) during whole treatment course. This effect was attributed to the resultant improvements in cardiac function by O2 pulse, and to the difference between inspired and expired oxygen concentration rather than minute ventilation. Addition of dietary MCT to ghrelin treatment improved the aerobic capacity of underweight COPD patients, likely by mechanisms of increased O2 delivery through improvements in primary cardiocirculatory and muscular crosstalk.",

At 3 mo, participants in the MCT group had a 48.1% increase in 10-s leg open and close test performance [intention-to-treat adjusted means: MCT 2.28 n/10 s (1.37, 3.19) compared with LCT -0.59 n/10 s (-1.52, 0.35), P < 0.05], a 27.8% increase in a 30-s repetitive saliva swallowing test [MCT 0.5 n/30 s (0.1, 1.0) compared with LCT -0.5 n/30 s (-0.9, 0.0), P < 0.05], and a 7.5% increase in Functional Independence Measure score, a questionnaire for assessing ADL [MCT 5.6 points (1.3, 9.9) compared with LCT -6.6 points (-11.3, -2.0), P < 0.05]. CONCLUSION: MCTs (6 g/d) could increase the muscle strength and function of frail elderly individuals and also improve their ADL. This trial was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry as UMIN000023302.",

METHODS: After an 8-week prospective baseline period, people with drug-resistant epilepsy were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive triheptanoin or MCTs. Treatment was titrated over 3 weeks to a maximum of 100 mL/d to be distributed over 3 meals and mixed into food, followed by 12-week maintenance before tapering. The primary aims were to assess the following: (a) safety by comparing the number of intervention-related adverse events with triheptanoin vs MCT treatment and (b) adherence, measured as a percentage of the prescribed treatment doses taken. RESULTS: Thirty-four people were randomized (17 to MCT and 17 to triheptanoin). There were no differences regarding (a) the number of participants completing the study (11 vs 9 participants), (b) the time until withdrawal, (c) the total number of adverse events or those potentially related to treatment, (d) median doses of oils taken (59 vs 55 mL/d, P = 0.59), or (e) change in seizure frequency (54% vs 102%, P = 0.13). Please note that people with focal unaware seizures were underrepresented in the triheptanoin treatment arm (P = 0.04). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances (47% and 62.5% of participants). Five people taking on average 0.73 mL/kg body weight MCTs (0.64 mL/kg median) and one person taking 0.59 mL/kg triheptanoin showed >50% reduction in seizure frequency, specifically focal unaware seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: Add-on treatment with MCTs or triheptanoin was feasible, safe, and tolerated for 12 weeks in two-thirds of people with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Our results indicate a protective effect of MCTs on focal unaware seizures. This warrants further study."

Older women (NG, n = 10; PD, n = 9) underwent a 4-h metabolic study after each of 4 different treatments: (i) no treatment (control), (ii) 5 days of MCT alone (30 g·day-1), (iii) 1 session of 30 min of AE alone, and (iv) 5 days of MCT and AE combined (MCT+AE). Blood was sampled every 30 min over 4 h for analysis. In NG, MCT+AE induced the highest area under the curve (AUC) for plasma ketones (835 ± 341 μmol·h·L-1); this value was 69% higher than that observed with MCT alone (P < 0.05). AUCs were not different between MCT alone and MCT+AE in PD, but both treatments induced a significantly higher AUC than the control or AE alone (P < 0.05). Although there was a trend towards a higher ketone AUC in NG versus PD with AE alone (P = 0.091), there was no significant difference between the ketone AUCs in PD and NG. In conclusion, MCT+AE was more ketogenic in older women than MCT or AE alone. MCT+AE had a synergistic effect on ketonemia in NG but not in PD. Whether improving insulin sensitivity with a longer term AE intervention can improve the ketogenic effect of MCT in PD and thereby increase brain ketone uptake in older people merits further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Background: Lower-brain glucose uptake is commonly present before the onset of cognitive deterioration associated with aging and may increase the risk of Alzheimer disease. Ketones are the brain's main alternative energy substrate to glucose. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are rapidly β-oxidized and are ketogenic but also have gastrointestinal side effects. We assessed whether MCT emulsification into a lactose-free skim-milk matrix [emulsified MCTs (MCT-Es)] would improve ketogenesis, reduce side effects, or both compared with the same oral dose of MCTs consumed without emulsification [nonemulsified MCTs (MCT-NEs)]. Objectives: Our aims were to show that, in healthy adults, MCT-Es will induce higher ketonemia and have fewer side effects than MCT-NEs and the effects of MCT-NEs and MCT-Es on ketogenesis and plasma medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) will be dose-dependent. Methods: Using a metabolic study day protocol, 10 healthy adults were each given 3 separate doses (10, 20, or 30 g) of MCT-NEs or MCT-Es with a standard breakfast or no treatment [control (CTL)]. Blood samples were taken every 30 min for 4 h to measure plasma ketones (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), octanoate, decanoate, and other metabolites. Participants completed a side-effects questionnaire at the end of each study day. Results: Compared with CTL, MCT-NEs increased ketogenesis by 2-fold with no significant differences between doses. MCT-Es increased total plasma ketones by 2- to 4-fold in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with MCT-NEs, MCT-Es increased plasma MCFA bioavailability (F) by 2- to 3-fold and decreased the number of side effects by ∼50%. Conclusions: Emulsification increased the ketogenic effect and decreased side effects in a dose-dependent manner for single doses of MCTs ≤30 g under matching conditions. Further investigation is needed to establish whether emulsification could sustain ketogenesis and minimize side effects and therefore be used as a treatment to change brain ketone availability over a prolonged period of time. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02409927."

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether brain ketone uptake in AD increases in response to MCT as it would in young healthy adults. METHODS: Mild-moderate AD patients sequentially consumed 30 g/d of two different MCT supplements, both for one month: a mixture of caprylic (55%) and capric acids (35%) (n = 11), followed by a wash-out and then tricaprylin (95%; n = 6). Brain ketone (11C-acetoacetate) and glucose (FDG) uptake were quantified by PET before and after each MCT intervention. RESULTS: Brain ketone consumption doubled on both types of MCT supplement. The slope of the relationship between plasma ketones and brain ketone uptake was the same as in healthy young adults. Both types of MCT increased total brain energy metabolism by increasing ketone supply without affecting brain glucose utilization. CONCLUSION: Ketones from MCT compensate for the brain glucose deficit in AD in direct proportion to the level of plasma ketones achieved.",

      "abstract": "Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13, constitutes the malate-aspartate shuttle, the main NADH-shuttle in the liver. Citrin deficiency causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Citrin deficiency is predicted to impair hepatic glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis, resulting in hepatic energy deficit. Secondary decrease in hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) expression has been considered a cause of hyperammonemia in CTLN2. We previously reported that medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplement therapy with a low-carbohydrate formula was effective in CTLN2 to prevent a relapse of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. We present the therapy for six CTLN2 patients. All the patients' general condition steadily improved and five patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy recovered from unconsciousness in a few days. Before the treatment, plasma glutamine levels did not increase over the normal range and rather decreased to lower than the normal range in some patients. The treatment promptly decreased the blood ammonia level, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma citrulline levels and an increase in plasma glutamine levels. These findings indicated that hyperammonemia was not only caused by the impairment of ureagenesis at ASS1 step, but was also associated with an impairment of glutamine synthetase (GS) ammonia-detoxification system in the hepatocytes. There was no decrease in the GS expressing hepatocytes. MCT supplement with a low-carbohydrate formula can supply the energy and/or substrates for ASS1 and GS, and enhance ammonia detoxification in hepatocytes. Histological improvement in the hepatic steatosis and ASS1-expression was also observed in a patient after long-term treatment.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether a dietary supplement of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) reduces Candida colonization in preterm infants. METHODS: Preterm infants with Candida colonization (n = 12) receiving enteral feedings of either infant formula (n = 5) or breast milk (n = 7) were randomized to MCT supplementation (n = 8) or no supplementation (n = 4). Daily stool samples were collected to determine fungal burden during a 3-week study period. Infants in the MCT group received supplementation during 1 week of the study period. The primary outcome was fungal burden during the supplementation period as compared with the periods before and after supplementation. RESULTS: Supplementation of MCT led to a marked increase in MCT intake relative to unsupplemented breast milk or formula as measured by capric acid content. In the treatment group, there was a significant reduction in fungal burden during the supplementation period as compared with the period before supplementation (rate ratio, 0.15; P = 0.02), with a significant increase after supplementation was stopped (rate ratio, 61; P < 0.001). Fungal burden in the control group did not show similar changes. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplementation with MCT may be an effective method to reduce Candida colonization in preterm infants.",

Recent preclinical data indicate that targeting this metabolic phenotype by a ketogenic diet (KD), especially in combination with calorie restriction, slows tumor growth and enhances metronomic cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy of NB xenografts. Because calorie restriction would be contraindicated in most cancer patients, the aim of the present study was to optimize the KD such that the tumors are sensitized to CP without the need of calorie restriction. In a NB xenograft model, metronomic CP was combined with KDs of different triglyceride compositions and fed to CD1-nu mice ad libitum. Metronomic CP in combination with a KD containing 8-carbon medium-chain triglycerides exerted a robust anti-tumor effect, suppressing growth and causing a significant reduction of tumor blood-vessel density and intratumoral hemorrhage, accompanied by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in NB cells. Furthermore, the KDs caused a significant reduction in the serum levels of essential amino acids, but increased those of serine, glutamine and glycine. Our data suggest that targeting energy metabolism by a modified KD may be considered as part of a multimodal treatment regimen to improve the efficacy of classic anti-NB therapy."

Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) on the intestinal morphology, intestinal function and energy metabolism of piglets with IUGR. At weaning (21 ± 1.1 d of age), 24 IUGR piglets and 24 normal birth weight (NBW) piglets were selected according to their birth weights (BW) (IUGR: 0.95 ± 0.04 kg BW; NBW: 1.58 ± 0.04 kg BW) and their weights at the time of weaning (IUGR: 5.26 ± 0.15 kg BW; NBW: 6.98 ± 0.19 kg BW). The piglets were fed a diet of either long-chain triglycerides (LCT) (containing 5% LCT) or MCT (containing 1% LCT and 4% MCT) for 28 d. Then, the piglets' intestinal morphology, biochemical parameters and mRNA abundance related to intestinal damage and energy metabolism were determined. IUGR was found to impair intestinal morphology, with evidence of decreased villus height and increased crypt depth; however, these negative effects of IUGR were ameliorated by MCT treatment. IUGR piglets showed compromised intestinal digestion and absorption functions when compared with NBW piglets. However, feeding MCT increased the maltase activity in the jejunum and alleviated IUGR-induced reductions in plasma d-xylose concentrations and jejunal sucrase activity. IUGR decreased the efficiency of the piglets' intestinal energy metabolism; however, piglets fed an MCT diet exhibited increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and ATP synthase F1 complex beta polypeptide expression, as well as decreased adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase alpha 1 expression in the jejunum of piglets. In addition, up-regulation of the piglets' citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase levels was found to occur following MCT treatment at both the activity and the transcriptional levels of the jejunum. Therefore, it can be postulated that MCT treatment has beneficial effects in alleviating IUGR-induced intestinal morphologic damage, which is associated with improved intestinal energy metabolism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Three experiments were conducted to examine the overall hypothesis that addition of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and cysteamine hydrochloride (CSH) into the diets of young and growing pigs would stimulate the endogenous somatotropic axis to improve growth and performance. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, weaner pigs were given either a 5 d dietary supplement of 5 % MCT (n = 8) or a control diet (n = 8). MCT increased the plasma concentration of growth hormone (GH; P < 0.05) and the GH secretagogue, ghrelin (P < 0.05). Additionally, the MCT treatment reduced scouring (P < 0.05), maintained villous height in the small intestine (P < 0.05) and stabilised daily weight gain (P < 0.05), compared to the controls. Experiment 2 compared the effects of 4 levels (0, 1, 3 and 6 % v/v) of MCT supplementation in grower-finisher male pigs, of approximately 35 kg live weight (n = 15 per treatment). Blood samples taken after 7 wk of treatment showed that the MCT supplementation increased circulating ghrelin (P < 0.001), GH (P < 0.01) and insulin (P < 0.05) concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Daily weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were not affected by the MCT diets. In Experiment 3, 64 female pigs of approximately 60 kg live weight were allocated to one of three dietary treatments: control (n = 20); 6 % MCT (n = 21); and 70 mg/kg CSH (n = 21). After 3 wk of supplementation, the MCT treated pigs had a higher plasma concentration of ghrelin compared to the control and CSH pigs (P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of GH and weight were not affected by any of the dietary treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is provided in Experiment 1 to support the use of dietary MCT supplements, perhaps acting via stimulation of somatotropic endocrine pathways, to minimise weaning-associated disorders such as slowing of growth and diarrhoea. In Experiments 2 and 3, although there was no effect on weight gain or feed conversion ratio in either experiment, MCT and CSH increased endocrine components of the somatotropic axis."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Currently there are no established guidelines regarding the use of long-chain triglycerides (LCT) vs. medium-chain triglycerides medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)/long-chain triglycerides (LCT) in total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Severe malnutrition of patients with refractory cachexia (RC) often causes their disqualification from invasive methods of treatment thus decreasing their quality of life and survival time. AIM: To compare the changes in nutritional state of patients with RC receiving PN with LCT and LCT/MCT lipid emulsions and to assess the influence of enteral nutrition on their survival time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised of 50 patients (23 female, 27 male) with a median age of 66 years. Refractory cachexia was diagnosed in them due to dysphagia secondary to solid tumours causing obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract (GT). All patients were qualified for surgical gastrostomy due to contraindications to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The patients were randomly assigned into one of two groups and perioperatively received either LCT or LCT/MCT. Blood samples were collected four times and tested for: total protein, albumin, prealbumin, and C-reactive protein concentration. Patients received Home Enteral Nutrition after discharge from hospital. RESULTS: Changes in nutritional status parameters were similar among patients receiving lipid emulsions LCT vs. MCT/LCT in TPN for 11 days. The mean survival time of all patients operated to gain enteral access to nutrition was 192 ±268 days, and the median survival was 98 days. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding the short-term TPN, the results of the study do not demonstrate any superiority of MCT/LCT lipid emulsions over LCT, or vice versa. The inability to eat significantly accelerates unintended body mass loss among patients with RC. Disqualification from invasive treatment options deprives some patients of the benefits they might have obtained from the surgical access to GT and enteral nutrition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is characterized by a decrease in oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, possibly mediated by reduced expression of the cell-surface protein cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36). Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were therefore supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), a substrate that bypasses CD36, based on the assumption that the metabolic modulation will ameliorate ventricular remodeling. METHODS: The diet of 2-month-old and 6-month-old SHRs was supplemented with 5% MCT (Tricaprylin), for 4 months. Metabolic modulation was assessed by mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Blood pressure was measured noninvasively. LVH was assessed with the use of hypertrophy index, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, mRNA expression of B-type natriuretic peptide, cardiac fibrosis, and calcineurin-A levels. Oxidative stress indicators (cardiac malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, and 3-nitrotyrosine levels), myocardial energy level (ATP, phosphocreatine), and lipid profile were determined. RESULTS: Supplementation of MCT stimulated fatty acid oxidation in animals of both age groups, reduced hypertrophy and oxidative stress along with the maintenance of energy level. Blood pressure, body weight, and lipid profile were unaffected by the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that modulation of myocardial fatty acid metabolism by MCT prevents progressive cardiac remodeling in SHRs, possibly by maintenance of energy level and decrease in oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Brain glucose hypometabolism is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that cognition is improved by providing AD patients with an alternate energy source: ketones derived from either ketogenic diet or supplementation with medium chain triglycerides (MCT). Recently, data on the neuroprotective capacity of MCT-derived medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) suggest 8-carbon and 10-carbon MCFA may have cognition-enhancing properties which are not related to ketone production. We investigated the effect of 8 week treatment with MCT8, MCT10 or sunflower oil supplementation (5% by weight of chow diet) in 21 month old Wistar rats. Both MCT diets increased ketones plasma similarly compared to control diet, but MCT diets did not increase ketones in the brain. Treatment with MCT10, but not MCT8, significantly improved novel object recognition memory compared to control diet, while social recognition increased in both MCT groups. MCT8 and MCT10 diets decreased weight compared to control diet, where MCFA plasma levels were higher in MCT10 groups than in MCT8 groups. Both MCT diets increased IRS-1 (612) phosphorylation and decreased S6K phosphorylation (240/244) but only MCT10 increased Akt phosphorylation (473). MCT8 supplementation increased synaptophysin, but not PSD-95, in contrast MCT10 had no effect on either synaptic marker. Expression of Ube3a, which controls synaptic stability, was increased by both MCT diets. Cortex transcription via qPCR showed that immediate early genes related to synaptic plasticity (arc, plk3, junb, egr2, nr4a1) were downregulated by both MCT diets while MCT8 additionally down-regulated fosb and egr1 but upregulated grin1 and gba2. These results demonstrate that treatment of 8- and 10-carbon length MCTs in aged rats have slight differential effects on synaptic stability, protein synthesis and behavior that may be independent of brain ketone levels.",

Previously it was shown that long-term MCT supplementation strongly affects lipid metabolism in mice. We here investigate sex-specific effects in mice with very-long-chain-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency in response to a long-term MCT modified diet. We quantified blood lipids, acylcarnitines, glucose, insulin and free fatty acids, as well as tissue triglycerides in the liver and skeletal muscle under a control and an MCT diet over 1 year. In addition, visceral and hepatic fat content and muscular intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) were assessed by in vivo(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques. The long-term application of an MCT diet induced a marked alteration of glucose homeostasis. However, only VLCAD-/- female mice developed a severe metabolic syndrome characterized by marked insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, severe hepatic and visceral steatosis, whereas VLCAD-/- males seemed to be protected and only presented with milder insulin resistance. Moreover, the highly saturated MCT diet is associated with a decreased hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity in females aggravating the harmful effects of a saturated MCT diet. Long-term MCT supplementation deeply affects lipid metabolism in a sexual dimorphic manner resulting in a severe metabolic syndrome only in female mice. These findings are striking since the first signs of insulin resistance already occur in female VLCAD-/- mice during their reproductive period. How these metabolic adaptations are finally regulated needs to be determined. More important, the relevance of these findings for humans under these dietary modifications needs to be investigated.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six male BALB/C nude mice were injected subcutaneously with tumor cells of the colon cancer cell line HCT116. The animals were then randomly split into three feeding groups and fed either a ketogenic diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and MCT (MKD group; n=12) or lard only (LKD group; n=12) or a standard diet (SD group; n=12) ad libitum. Experiments were ended upon attainment of the target tumor volume of 600 mm3 to 700 mm3. The three diets were compared for tumor growth and survival time (interval between tumor cell injection and attainment of target tumor volume). RESULTS: The tumor growth in the MKD and LKD groups was significantly delayed compared to that in the SD group. CONCLUSIONS: Application of an unrestricted ketogenic diet delayed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Further studies are needed to address the mechanism of this diet intervention and the impact on other tumor-relevant parameters such as invasion and metastasis.",

However, results from human intervention studies investigating the weight reducing potential of MCTs, have been mixed. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of MCTs, specifically C8:0 and C10:0, to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) on weight loss and body composition in adults. Changes in blood lipid levels were secondary outcomes. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials >3 weeks' duration conducted in healthy adults were identified searching Web of Knowledge, Discover, PubMed, Scopus, New Zealand Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL until March 2014 with no language restriction. Identified trials were assessed for bias. Mean differences were pooled and analyzed using inverse variance models with fixed effects. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated using I(2) statistic. An I(2)>50% or P<0.10 indicated heterogeneity. RESULTS: Thirteen trials (n=749) were identified. Compared with LCTs, MCTs decreased body weight (-0.51 kg [95% CI-0.80 to -0.23 kg]; P<0.001; I(2)=35%); waist circumference (-1.46 cm [95% CI -2.04 to -0.87 cm]; P<0.001; I(2)=0%), hip circumference (-0.79 cm [95% CI -1.27 to -0.30 cm]; P=0.002; I(2)=0%), total body fat (standard mean difference -0.39 [95% CI -0.57 to -0.22]; P<0.001; I(2)=0%), total subcutaneous fat (standard mean difference -0.46 [95% CI -0.64 to -0.27]; P<0.001; I(2)=20%), and visceral fat (standard mean difference -0.55 [95% CI -0.75 to -0.34]; P<0.001; I(2)=0%). No differences were seen in blood lipid levels. Many trials lacked sufficient information for a complete quality assessment, and commercial bias was detected. Although heterogeneity was absent, study designs varied with regard to duration, dose, and control of energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Replacement of LCTs with MCTs in the diet could potentially induce modest reductions in body weight and composition without adversely affecting lipid profiles. However, further research is required by independent research groups using large, well-designed studies to confirm the efficacy of MCT and to determine the dosage needed for the management of a healthy body weight and composition.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) is a deadly complication of long term parenteral nutrition (PN) use in infants. Fish oil-based lipid emulsion has been shown in recent years to effectively treat PNALD. Alternative fat sources free of essential fatty acids have recently been investigated for health benefits related to decreased inflammatory response. We hypothesized that the addition of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) to a purified fish oil-based diet would decrease the response to inflammatory challenge in mice, while allowing for sufficient growth and development. MATERIALS/METHODS: Six groups of ten adult male C57/Bl6 mice were pair-fed different dietary treatments for a period of twelve weeks, varying only in fat source (percent calories by weight): 10.84% soybean oil (SOY), 10% coconut oil (HCO), 10% medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), 3% purified fish oil (PFO), 3% purified fish oil with 3% medium-chain triglycerides (50:50 MCT:PFO) and 3% purified fish oil with 7.59% medium-chain triglycerides (70:30 MCT:PFO). An endotoxin challenge was administered to half of the animals in each group at the completion of dietary treatment. RESULTS: All groups demonstrated normal growth throughout the study period. Groups fed MCT and HCO diets demonstrated biochemical essential fatty acid deficiency and decreased IL-6 and TNF-α response to endotoxin challenge. Groups containing PFO had increased inflammatory response to endotoxin challenge, and the addition of MCT to PFO mitigated this inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the addition of MCT to PFO formulations may decrease the host response to inflammatory challenge, which may pose potential for optimized PN formulations. Inclusion of MCT in lipid emulsions given with PN formulations may be of use in therapeutic interventions for disease states resulting from chronic inflammation.",

Thus, additional approaches aimed at slowing the progression of the disease have been investigated. Reports detailing reduced brain glucose metabolism in the early stages of AD led to the hypothesis that alternate energy sources aimed at increasing neuronal metabolism may protect neurons and thus benefit patients with AD. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are metabolized to ketone bodies that serve as an alternative source of energy for neurons. Data from clinical trials suggest that MCTs improve cognition in patients with mild to moderate AD in apolipoprotein E4-negative patients. Adverse events observed were mild and included minor gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, dyspepsia, and flatulence. However, since genomic profiles are not routinely conducted in patients with AD in a clinical setting, the role of MCTs in clinical practice seems to be minimal.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is often accompanied by development of hepatic steatosis and less frequently by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) leading to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Replacement of corn oil with medium chain triacylglycerols (MCT) in the diets of alcohol-fed rats has been shown to protect against steatosis and alcoholic liver injury. The current study was designed to determine if a similar beneficial effect of MCT occurs in a rat model of NAFLD. Groups of male rats were isocalorically overfed diets containing 10%, 35% or 70% total energy as corn oil or a 70% fat diet in which corn oil was replaced with increasing concentrations of saturated fat (18:82, beef tallow:MCT oil) from 20% to 65% for 21 days using total enteral nutrition (TEN). As dietary content of corn oil increased, hepatic steatosis and serum alanine amino transferases were elevated (P < 0.05). This was accompanied by greater expression of cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1 (P < 0.05) and higher concentrations of polyunsaturated 18:2 and 20:4 fatty acids (FA) in the hepatic lipid fractions (P < 0.05). Keeping the total dietary fat at 70%, but increasing the proportion of MCT-enriched saturated fat resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in steatosis and necrosis without affecting CYP2E1 induction. There was no incorporation of C8-C10 FAs into liver lipids, but increasing the ratio of MCT to corn oil: reduced liver lipid 18:2 and 20:4 concentrations; reduced membrane susceptibility to radical attack; stimulated FA β- and ω-oxidation as a result of activation of peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α, and appeared to increase mitochondrial respiration through complex III. These data suggest that replacing unsaturated fats like corn oil with MCT oil in the diet could be utilized as a potential treatment for NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia is a disorder characterized by exudative enteropathy resulting from morphologic abnormalities of the intestinal lymphatics. Intestinal lymphangiectasia can be primary or secondary, so the diagnosis of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia must first exclude the possibility of secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia. A double-balloon enteroscopy and biopsy, as well as the pathology can be used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal lymphangiectasia. A polymeric diet containing medium-chain triglycerides and total parenteral nutrition may be a useful therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old girl of Mongoloid ethnicity was admitted to our hospital with a history of diarrhea and edema. She was diagnosed with protein-losing enteropathy caused by intestinal lymphangiectasia. This was confirmed by a double-balloon enteroscopy and multi-dot biopsy. After treatment with total parenteral nutrition in hospital, which was followed by a low-fat and medium-chain triglyceride diet at home, she was totally relieved of her symptoms. CONCLUSION: Intestinal lymphangiectasia can be diagnosed with a double-balloon enteroscopy and multi-dot biopsy, as well as the pathology of small intestinal tissue showing edema of the submucosa and lymphangiectasia. Because intestinal lymphangiectasia can be primary or secondary, the diagnosis of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia must first exclude the possibility of secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia. A positive clinical response to the special diet therapy, namely a low-fat and medium-chain triglyceride diet, can further confirm the diagnosis of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia."

Forty-one healthy Beagles, mean age 9.9 years (range 3.1 to 14.8), were fed control or one of two treatment foods for 6 months. All foods were complete and balanced and met the nutrient requirements for adult dogs, and had similar concentrations of moisture, protein, and fat (approx. 7.4%, 14.0%, and 18.1%, respectively). The treatment diets both contained added L-carnitine (300 mg/kg) and 0.6% (treatment food 1) or 1.5% (treatment food 2) added fish oil. Treatment food 2 also had increased MCT from coconut oil, added corn oil, and reduced animal fat. Composition of serum FA was determined by gas chromatography of FA methyl esters. Metabolomic profiles of serum samples were determined from extracted supernatants that were split and run on GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms, for identification and relative quantification of small metabolites. Body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Among dog groups, there was no change in total-lean-body weight, or in serum total protein and serum albumin concentrations, based on time or dietary treatment. Serum concentrations of carnitine metabolites were decreased in geriatric (>7 years) vs. mature adult (≤ 7 years) dogs, and supplementation with L-carnitine attenuated the effects of aging. The ratio of PUFA to SFA was significantly greater in mature dogs at baseline (P ≤ 0.05). Serum concentrations of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic FA increased in a dose-dependent manner. Dogs consuming treatment food 2 also had increased serum concentrations of lauric and myristic FA, and decreased concentrations of SFA, MUFA, and arachidonate (all P ≤ 0.05) and their PUFA to SFA ratio increased. In summary, dietary MCT, fish oil, and L-carnitine counterbalanced the effects of aging on circulating concentrations of these compounds.",

METHODS: A 20-gauge pars plana vitrectomy was performed in the right eye of 28 rabbits. An ophthalmologic examination was performed every week until rabbits were killed. At days 7, 30, 60, and 90, rabbits were killed and the treated eyes were examined macroscopically and prepared for histologic examination. Principal outcome was retinal toxicity evaluated by light and electron microscopy, and secondary outcomes were the presence of medium-chain triglyceride emulsification, inflammatory reactions, and the development of cataract. RESULTS: Histologic examination did not reveal any retinal toxicity. Two cases of moderate emulsification were observed, but in these cases, emulsification was caused by the perioperative injection of the agent and did not increase during the postoperative period. We noted 13 cases of inflammatory reaction in vitreous cavity and no case of inflammatory reaction in anterior chamber. Two eyes developed cataract as a result of perioperative trauma to the lens with the vitreous cutter and not secondary to the presence of medium-chain triglycerides in the vitreous cavity. CONCLUSION: Medium-chain triglycerides did not induce morphologic evidence of retinal toxicity. The results suggest that medium-chain triglycerides could be a promising alternative intraocular tamponading agent for the treatment of retinal detachments.",

One of the main factors associated with this increase is the change in nutritional status of individuals. Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are rapidly metabolized and less stored in the adipose tissue, being a possible tool for weight control. In order to analyze the influence of consumption of this lipid on satiety, body composition and energy expenditure (EE), a literature review was performed of controlled clinical studies reported in PUBMED and ELSEVIER between the years 2000 and 2010. Fourteen articles were selected presenting short and long-term intervention. Among these, six showed a decrease in body mass of individuals, with consequent loss of weight. Only one showed a positive effect on satiation and four showed an increase in EE. Thus the results are inconclusive and there is a need for further controlled studies with standardized amounts of MCT, so that its use can become an alternative for obesity nutritional treatment.",

The authors hypothesized that a lipid emulsion containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and soybean, olive, and fish oils would be as safe and well tolerated as a soybean emulsion while beneficially influencing the fatty acid profile. METHODS: Double-blind, controlled study in 53 neonates (<34 weeks' gestation) randomized to receive at least 7 days of PN containing either an emulsion of MCTs and soybean, olive, and fish oils or a soybean oil emulsion. Target lipid dosage was 1.0 g fat/kg body weight [BW]/d on days 1-3, 2 g/kg BW/d on day 4, 3 g/kg BW/d on day 5, and 3.5 g/kg BW/d on days 6-14. RESULTS: Test emulsion vs control, mean ± SD: baseline triglyceride concentrations were 0.52 ± 0.16 vs 0.54 ± 0.19 mmol/L and increased similarly in both groups to 0.69 ± 0.38 vs 0.67 ± 0.36 on day 8 of treatment (P = .781 for change). A significantly higher decrease in total and direct bilirubin vs baseline was seen in the test group compared with the control group P < .05 between groups). In plasma and red blood cell phospholipids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were higher, and the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio was lower in the test group (P < .05 vs control). CONCLUSIONS: The lipid emulsion, based on a mixture of MCTs and soybean, olive, and fish oils, was safe and well tolerated by preterm infants while beneficially modulating the fatty acid profile.",

OBJECTIVE: MCT supplementation has been recognized as a safe dietary intervention, but long-term observations into later adulthood are still not available. We investigated the consequences of a prolonged MCT diet on abdominal fat distribution and composition and on liver fat. DESIGN: Mice with very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD(-/-)) were supplemented for 1 y with a diet in which MCTs replaced long-chain triglycerides without increasing the total fat content. The dietary effects on abdominal fat accumulation and composition were analyzed by in vivo (1)H- and (13)C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (9.4 Tesla). RESULTS: After 1 y of MCT supplementation, VLCAD(-/-) mice accumulated massive visceral fat and had a dramatic increase in the concentration of serum free fatty acids. Furthermore, we observed a profound shift in body triglyceride composition, ie, concentrations of physiologically important polyunsaturated fatty acids dramatically decreased. (1)H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis and histologic evaluation of the liver also showed pronounced fat accumulation and marked oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Although the MCT-supplemented diet has been reported to prevent the development of cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy in fatty acid oxidation disorders, our data show that long-term MCT supplementation results in a severe clinical phenotype similar to that of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and the metabolic syndrome.",

Serum and tissue samples were collected 5 days after ethanol or TNBS enema. The severity of colitis was evaluated pathologically, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity was measured in colonic tissues. Furthermore, protein levels for inflammatory cytokines and a chemokine were assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in colonic tissues. Induction of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β in the colon by TNBS enema was markedly attenuated by the MCT+ diet among the 3 diets studied. Furthermore, the induction of chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 also was blunted significantly in animals fed the MCT+ diets. As a result, MPO activities in the colonic tissue also were blunted significantly in animals fed the MCT+ diets compared with those fed the control diets or the MCT- diets. Furthermore, the MCT+ diet improved chemically induced colitis significantly among the 3 diets studied. Diets enriched with both MCTs and N-3 fatty acids may be effective for the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease as antiinflammatory immunomodulating nutrients.",

Thirty-six calves were assigned to a randomized block design with 3 dietary treatments, 10 calves per treatment, and a baseline group of 6 calves. Three different milk-replacer-based diets were designed to deliver less than 2% of the lipid as medium-chain triglycerides (control; diet contained no added medium-chain triglycerides), 32% medium-chain triglycerides primarily as caprylate (CAP oil), and 32% of fatty acids primarily as laurate from coconut oil (CCO). Calves were offered 0.28 Mcal of intake energy/kg of body weight (BW)0.75 from d 1 to 7 and 0.32 Mcal of intake energy/kg of BW0.75 adjusted weekly for BW from d 8 to harvest. Dry matter, intake energy, crude protein, and fat intakes were 53.7 kg, 281.8 Mcal, 14.6 kg, and 13.0 kg; 56.6 kg, 297.2 Mcal, 15.8 kg, and 14.2 kg; and 53.8 kg, 280.4 Mcal, 15.4 kg, and 13.3 kg for the control, CAP oil, and CCO treatments, respectively. Dry matter, energy, protein, and fat intakes did not differ among treatments. At approximately 65 kg of BW, 5 calves per treatment were given an insulin challenge. After the challenge the decrease in plasma glucose concentration was greater for the calves fed the CAP oil diet compared with those fed the control and CCO diets. Calves were harvested at approximately 88 kg of BW. Empty body gains were 0.92, 0.79, and 0.87 kg/d for control-, CAP oil-, and CCO-fed calves, respectively, and the gains of the CAP oil-fed calves were less than those of the control-fed calves. Empty body crude protein, ash, and water were not different among treatments. Empty body retained energy and fat tended to be 5.6 and 8.7% greater for calves consuming the CCO diet than for those fed the control diet. The livers of calves consuming the CCO diet were 330 g heavier and contained 15% more fat than the livers of the control and CAP oil calves. The results of this study demonstrate that the energy demand of the calf to maintain body temperature resulted in increased oxidation of intake energy; thus, overall body composition differences could not be detected. However, the intake of CCO increased the accumulation of lipid in the liver and carcass despite the apparent cold stress conditions.",

Under the LCT diet, VLCAD-KO mice accumulated significantly higher blood cholesterol concentrations compared to WT mice. The MCT-diet induced severe hepatic steatosis, significantly higher serum free fatty acids and impaired hepatic lipid mobilization in VLCAD-KO mice. Expression at mRNA level of hepatic lipogenic genes was up-regulated. The long-term MCT diet stimulates lipogenesis and impairs hepatic lipid metabolism in VLCAD-KO mice. These results suggest a critical reconsideration of a long-term MCT-modified diet in human VLCADD. In contrast, MCT in situations of increased energy demand appears to be a safer treatment alternative.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty (30/30) premature neonates (age 3-7 days, gestational age ≤ 34 weeks, birth weights 1000-2500 g) received parenteral nutrition (PN) with either SMOFlipid 20% (study group) or a conventional lipid emulsion (Intralipid 20%, control group) for a minimum of 7 up to 14 days. Lipid supply started at 0.5 g · kg body weight(-1) · day(-1) on day 1 and increased stepwise (by 0.5 g) up to 2 g · kg body weight(-1) · day(-1) on days 4 to 14. Safety and efficacy parameters were assessed on days 0, 8, and 15 if PN was continued. RESULTS: Adverse events, serum triglycerides, vital signs, local tolerance, and clinical laboratory did not show noticeable group differences, confirming the safety of study treatment. At study end, γ-glutamyl transferase was lower in the study versus the control group (107.8 ± 81.7 vs 188.8 ± 176.7 IU/L, P < 0.05). The relative increase in body weight (day 8 vs baseline) was 5.0% ± 6.5% versus 5.1% ± 6.6% (study vs control, not significant). In the study group, an increase in n-3 FA in red blood cell phospholipids and n-3:n-6 FA ratio was observed. Plasma α-tocopherol (study vs control) was increased versus baseline on day 8 (26.35 ± 10.03 vs 3.67 ± 8.06 μmol/L, P < 0.05) and at study termination (26.97 ± 18.32 vs 8.73 ± 11.41 μmol/L, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral infusion of SMOFlipid was safe and well tolerated and showed a potential beneficial influence on cholestasis, n-3 FA, and vitamin E status in premature infants requiring PN.",

Increased malonyl coenzyme A production which compromises oxidation of long-chain fatty acids via carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1 inhibition plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these complications. Therapy consists primarily of nutritional support including frequent carbohydrate-rich meals. We studied the effect of a diet enriched in medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) on metabolic control/growth in GSD 1 as medium-chain fatty acids can be oxidised independently of CPT 1. METHODS: An adult female, a 1.6-year-old boy with GSD 1a and a 6.5-year-old girl with GSD 1b treated with a classical GSD diet were enrolled; their 'classical GSD diet' was supplemented with MCT fats. Concentrations of glucose, lactate, ketone bodies triglycerides, uric acid, acylcarnitines in blood and organic acids in urine were determined. RESULTS: No clinical or biochemical side-effects were observed. The MCT diet led to a decrease in uric acid concentrations in all patients. Triglyceride levels were reduced only in the youngest patient, while lactate concentrations did not significantly decrease. The MCT diet allowed for a reduction in carbohydrate and caloric intake required to maintain euglycaemia and led to improvement in growth in the two prepubertal patients. CONCLUSIONS: MCT supplementation had a positive effect on metabolic control and growth in our patients suffering from GSD 1.",

Male Wistar rats were given an intracolonic injection of TNBS and were then fed liquid diets containing MCTs or corn oil (AIN93) as controls. Serum and tissue samples were collected 1 week after TNBS enema. The severity of colitis was evaluated pathologically, and tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured. Furthermore, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels for inflammatory cytokines and a chemokine were assessed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. In another set of experiments, the protein expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 in the colon was measured 1 week after feeding of liquid diets. To investigate the effects of MCTs on macrophages, RAW246.7 macrophages were incubated with media containing albumin conjugated with MCT or linoleic acid, which is the major component of corn oil. Then, the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was measured. Dietary MCTs blunted significantly the protein levels of TLR-4 in the colon. Furthermore, the expression of TLR-4 was significantly blunted in RAW264.7 cells incubated with MCTs compared with cells incubated with linoleic acid. Induction of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), TNF-alpha, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) in the colon was attenuated by dietary MCT. Furthermore, MPO activities in the colonic tissue were significantly blunted in animals fed the MCT diets compared with those fed the control diets. As a result, dietary MCTs improved chemically induced colitis significantly. MCTs most likely are useful for the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease as an anti-inflammatory immunomodulating nutrient.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with highly increased plasma triglyceride levels are at risk of developing serious complications such as pancreatitis, coronary heart disease and stroke. Therefore it is important to rapidly decrease plasma triglyceride levels. A sufficient control of triglyceride levels with drugs like fibrates, statins or nicotinic acid can usually only be attained after a couple of weeks. Plasma exchange appears to be a fast but expensive method to reduce triglyceride levels. In this study we describe the use of a new omega-3 fatty acid and medium-chain triglyceride-rich formula diet as a therapeutic concept to reduce plasma triglyceride levels fast and effectively. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia were treated with the especially composed formula diet for a period of 7 days. RESULTS: Within this period of time, plasma triglycerides decreased from 1,601 (402-4,555) to 554 (142-2,382) mg/dl (p < 0.05). Total cholesterol levels were reduced from 417 (211-841) to 287 (165-457) mg/dl (p < 0.001). Fasting glucose and uric acid levels also slightly decreased (-8%; -12%). The formula diet as a 1-week treatment was well tolerated and accepted by the patients. CONCLUSION: This diet was successfully used as an acute treatment in severe hypertriglyceridemia and showed effectiveness in rapidly and safely lowering plasma triglyceride levels.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia is an uncommon congenital anomaly. It is an intrinsic abnormality of the intestinal lymphatics system. Over the years, various treatment options such as diuretics, albumin transfusions and a medium chain triglycerides (MCT) diet as well as surgical options such as resection of isolated segments and peritoneal-venous shunts have been used. An MCT diet, which is a low fat, high protein diet, is increasingly used in the management of this anomaly. AIM: The aim was to review the evidence for medium chain triglycerides as a therapeutic option in patients with primary intestinal lymphangiectasia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was performed and individual case details were extracted. We found 55 cases, of which 3 were from our own institute. The cases were divided in 2 groups: Group A (n=27) consisted of patients treated with MCT, and Group B (n=28) consisted patients not treated with MCT. Cases were analysed for symptomatic response to MCT as well as mortality. RESULTS: 17 of 27 cases (63%) treated with MCT had complete resolution of symptoms while only 10 of 28 (35.7%) patients in group B showed complete resolution. Mortality for Group A was 1 out of 27 (3.7%), while mortality in group B was 5 of 28 (17.85%) patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, although an MCT diet is not completely curative in all cases, it does improve the symptoms of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia and reduces mortality. Hence it is a valid option in the paediatric age group.",

METHODS: A total of 45 male Wistar rats were used, in which a skin flap of total thickness with an area of 4 cm2 was removed. The animals were divided randomly into 3 groups of 15 rats each, Control, Reference and Test groups, which were treated topically with 0.9% NaCl, a preparation of clostebol combined with neomycin sulfate and the test formulation, respectively. The wound areas were measured by digital planimetry at days zero, 3, 7 and 12 postoperative. Based on the wound area, we determined the degree of tissue repair and mean rate of repair at different time intervals. RESULTS: At day 3, an expansion of the wound area was observed in the Reference group and slight contraction in the Control and Test groups. On the subsequent days, the healing process, according to the degree of repair, proceeded in a linear manner, such that, at day 12, the healed area reached 77.95% of the initial ulcerated region in the Control group, 78.40% in the Reference group and 83.49% in the Test group, showing no significant differences. The overall mean rate of repair was equally similar at 12 days of treatment: 25.79 mm2/dia in the Control group, 25.42 mm2/dia in the Reference group and 27.38 mm2/dia in the Test group. CONCLUSION: The test preparation, applied topically on the experimentally induced cutaneous ulcers in rats, did not accelerate the process of tissue repair by secondary union.",

Patients with acute cholecystitis admitted to our hospital between April 1994 and March 2002 were classified into a poor nutrition group (n=40; total serum protein<5.0 g/dl) or a fair nutrition group (n=71; >5.0 g/dl). Patients with poor nutrition were significantly more elderly than those with fair nutrition, and had significantly higher serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to other laboratory data, gender distribution, or medical treatment. We supplemented ordinary meals with enteral nutrition including MCT in 16 patients during the convalescent stage (MCT group). We compared their length of hospital stay and days required to recovery to pre-admission functional status for activities of daily living (ADL) with the same intervals in 16 patients without supplementation (non-MCT group) selected to match for age, gender, and fair or poor nutritional status from among 111 patients. Hospitalizations were significantly longer in the poor nutrition group (43.0+/-2.2 days) than in the fair nutrition group (27.0+/-8.2 days). Significantly more days were required to recover ADL status in the poor nutrition group (12.0+/-7.2 days) than in the fair group (9.4+/-5.2 days). Hospitalizations were significantly shorter in the MCT group (20.1+/-15 days) than in the non-MCT group (35.4+/-12.8 days). Significantly fewer days were required to recover ADL status in the MCT group (10.9+/-7 days) than in the non-MCT group (13.1+/-6.8 days). Administration of enteral nutrition including MCT during convalescence from acute cholecystitis thus appears to promote functional recovery shorten hospital stay.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol consumption is known to induce cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) leading to lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatotoxicity. We showed that replacement of dietary long-chain triglycerides (LCT) by medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) could be protective. We now wondered whether the induction of mitochondrial CYP2E1 plays a role and whether liver injury could be avoided through mitochondrial intervention. METHODS: Rats were fed 4 different isocaloric liquid diets. The control group received our standard dextrin-maltose diet with intake limited to the average consumption of the 3 alcohol groups fed ad libitum the alcohol containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet. The fat was either 32% of calories as LCT (alcohol), or 16% as LCT + 16% as MCT (alcohol-MCT 16%), or 32% as MCT only (alcohol-MCT 32%). RESULTS: After 21 days, compared to the controls, the alcohol and both alcohol-MCT groups had a significant increase in mitochondrial CYP2E1 (p < 0.05 for both). As shown before, the same was found for the microsomal CYP2E1. When MCT replaced all the fat, like in the alcohol-MCT 32% group, CYP2E1 was significantly reduced by 40% in mitochondria (p < 0.05) and 30% in microsomes (p < 0.01). In mitochondria, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a parameter of oxidative stress, paralleled CYP2E1. Compared to controls, alcohol and alcohol-MCT 16% significantly raised mitochondrial 4-HNE (p < 0.001), whereas the alcohol-MCT 32% diet brought it down to control levels (p < 0.001). Mitochondrial reduced glutathione (GSH) was also significantly lowered by alcohol consumption (p < 0.05), and it increased to almost normal levels with alcohol-MCT 32% (p = 0.006). These changes in the mitochondria reflected the reduction observed in total liver in which alcohol-MCT 32% decreased the alcohol-induced steatosis with a diminution of triglycerides (p < 0.001) and of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Mitochondria participate in the induction of CYP2E1 by alcohol and contribute to lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion. Thus, lipid composition of the diet is an important determinant for the beneficial effect of MCT, with a diet containing a mixture of LCT/MCT being ineffective.",

METHODS: Twenty-four patients requiring mechanical ventilation were randomly selected in 2 groups and received total parenteral nutrition. Twelve patients received a MCT/LCT emulsion (50:50), the others used a 100% LCT emulsion. Nutritional status, metabolic rate, time of ventilatory support and weaning were evaluated. RESULTS: Both groups showed an improvement of all nutritional parameters evaluated; oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output and respiratory gas exchange ratio were similar in both groups. The duration of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different; however, the time of weaning in the MCT/LCT group was significantly shorter. The longer weaning time in the LCT group patients could be related to vasoactive intermediates deriving from long chain fatty acids. The T-cell subsets, which were evaluated for both groups, showed a significant decrease of T helper-T suppressor ratio in the LCT group. CONCLUSION: MCT/LCT emulsion is an effective lipid supplementation and should be considered the therapy of choice in COPD patients; however, the relationship between lipid emulsions administered and length of weaning requires further investigations.",

Metabolic abnormalities such as hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus frequently coexist, posing these patients to an increased cardiovascular risk. Drug therapy may improve some of these metabolic disturbances, but to date there are no treatments for lipodystrophy with proven benefit. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old man with HIV lipodystrophy was started on a standard low caloric diet with <30% of total fat and <10% of saturated fat, together with rosiglitazone 8 mg daily. After five months of treatment, given that lipodystrophic features and dyslipidaemia were still present in our patient, we tried to further improve therapeutic results by eucaloric substitution of medium chain triglycerides for dietary long chain fatty acids. Three months later, a dramatic change in body composition was shown with an increase in lean mass and a decrease in fat mass, together with an improvement in lipid profile. CONCLUSION: Eucaloric substitution of medium chain triglycerides for dietary long chain fatty acids may produce therapeutic benefits in HIV lipodystrophy.",

Dietary therapy for most subjects includes medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation but analysis of diet records indicates that the majority of patients consume oral MCT only with breakfast and at bedtime. We hypothesized that MCT immediately prior to exercise would provide an alternative fuel source during that bout of exercise and improve exercise tolerance in children with LCHAD deficiency. Nine subjects completed two 45 min moderate intensity (60-70% predicted maximum heart rate (HR)) treadmill exercise tests. Subjects were given 4 oz of orange juice alone or orange juice and 0.5 g MCT per kg lean body mass, 20 min prior to exercise in a randomized cross-over design. ECG and respiratory gas exchange including respiratory quotient (RQ) were monitored. Blood levels of acylcarnitines, creatine kinase, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were measured prior to and immediately after exercise, and again following 20 min rest. Creatine kinase and lactate levels did not change with exercise. There was no significant difference in RQ between the two exercise tests but there was a decrease in steady-state HR following MCT supplementation. Cumulative long-chain 3-hydroxyacylcarnitines were 30% lower and beta-hydroxybutyrate was three-fold higher after the MCT-pretreated exercise test compared to the test with orange juice alone. Coordinating MCT supplementation with periods of increased activity may improve the metabolic control of children with LCHAD and TFP deficiency following exercise.",

Nevertheless, matrices with functional properties, such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), should be precisely examined for supplementary advantages. The objective of this study was to identify the existence of combined biological actions of a functional oil enriched in PSs within MCTs and high-oleic canola (HOC), relative to a control (olive oil), in overweight, hyperlipidemic men using a rigorously controlled dietary intervention. Twenty-three overweight, hyperlipidemic men consumed both types of oil in a randomized, crossover trial for 6 weeks each. Fasted plasma samples were collected on the first and last 2 days of each study period. Body weight decreased -1.22 +/- 0.35 kg (P = .0019) and -1.68 +/- 0.47 kg (P = .0016) after the 6-week study period in the olive oil and functional oil groups, respectively. The end points for total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the functional oil group (P = .0006) were lower than in the olive oil group (P = .0002). Total cholesterol values decreased from comparable baseline to end point of 4.71 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (P < .0001) in the functional oil phase and 5.14 +/- 0.19 mmol/L (P = .0001) in the olive oil phase (P = .0592). In addition, LDL-C demonstrated a similar drop, to an end point of 3.12 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (P < .0001) and 3.54 +/- 0.18 mmol/L (P = .0002), for the functional oil and olive oil groups, respectively, with significant changes (P = .0221). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not change in either treatment. Triacylglycerol end points decreased in functional oil and olive oil groups (P = .0195 and .0105, respectively) to the same extent from baseline. Results indicate that PSs mixed within an MCT- and HOC-rich matrix lower plasma LDL-C, without significantly changing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, in hyperlipidemic, overweight men, and may therefore decrease the risk of cardiovascular events.",

The long-chain control diet was supplemented further with clofibric acid (0.5%) or isoproterenol (40 ppm), and growth was monitored for 10-12 days. Clofibrate increased rates of hepatic peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation of [1-(14)C]-palmitate by 60 and 186%, respectively. Furthermore, malonyl-CoA sensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I) activity increased 64% (P < 0.05) in pigs receiving clofibrate. Increased CPT I activity was not congruent with changes in message, as elevated abundance of CPT I mRNA was not detected (P = 0.16) when assessed by qRT-PCR. Neither rates of beta-oxidation nor CPT activities were affected by dietary MCT or by isoproterenol treatment (P > 0.1). Collectively, these findings indicate that clofibrate effectively induced hepatic CPT activity concomitant with increased fatty acid beta-oxidation.",

The pathway of formation of 2-HS, excreted in increased amounts in patients with peroxisomal diseases, is not absolutely clear. Moreover, there is no information about the enantiomeric distribution of 2-HS in human urine. Here, we describe the stereodifferentiation of 2-HS in urine samples of nine patients with Zellweger syndrome (ZS), and for the first time in urine samples of premature infants fed a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-containing diet. Using enantioselective multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, an increased excretion of 2R-HS was observed in all investigated ZS patients. 2-HS was also present in urine samples of premature infants fed MCT. Analogously to the ZS patients, a dominant 2R-HS excretion in the urine samples of the premature infants was identified. The formation of 2-HS is expected to result from the same or similar pathways as described for ZS patients. Additionally, we determined the absolute configuration of urinary 3-hydroxysebacic acid (3-HS) in the cases investigated. The enantioselective analysis provides further information for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with impaired peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Further insight into the metabolic origin and the biochemical pathway leading to these urinary metabolites is provided.",

We examined if an enteral formulation containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and hydrolyzed peptides would (1) minimally stimulate the exocrine pancreas by blunting cholecystokinin release and (2) decrease pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis. METHODS: In the first part of the study, on separate days, 6 healthy controls consumed a standard enteral formulation, an enteral formulation containing MCT and hydrolyzed peptides, and a high-fat meal. Baseline and postprandial plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations were analyzed. Subsequently, 8 patients with chronic pancreatitis were enrolled and instructed to complete a visual analog pain assessment for a baseline period of 2 weeks followed by three cans per day of the enteral formulation containing MCT and hydrolyzed peptides for 10 weeks. RESULTS: Mean CCK levels for our control subjects were 0.46 +/- 0.29 pM at baseline, 10.75 +/- 0.45 pM in response to the high-fat meal, and 7.9 +/- 1.25 pM in response to the standard enteral formulation. Of note, CCK levels were 1.43 +/- 0.72 pM in response to the enteral supplement containing MCT and hydrolyzed peptides. In patients with chronic pancreatitis, the average improvement in pain scores from baseline to the conclusion of the study was 61.8% (p = 0.01). This corresponded to a clinical improvement in 6 of the 8 patients. CONCLUSIONS: A complete enteral supplement containing MCT and hydrolyzed peptides minimally increases plasma CCK levels. This therapy may be effective in reducing postprandial pain associated with chronic pancreatitis.",

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Twenty-four healthy, overweight men with body mass indexes between 25 and 31 kg/m(2) consumed diets rich in MCT or LCT for 28 days each in a crossover randomized controlled trial. At baseline and after 4 weeks of each dietary intervention, energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry, and body composition was analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Upper body adipose tissue (AT) decreased to a greater extent (p < 0.05) with functional oil (FctO) compared with olive oil (OL) consumption (-0.67 +/- 0.26 kg and -0.02 +/- 0.19 kg, respectively). There was a trend toward greater loss of whole-body subcutaneous AT volume (p = 0.087) with FctO compared with OL consumption. Average energy expenditure was 0.04 +/- 0.02 kcal/min greater (p < 0.05) on day 2 and 0.03 +/- 0.02 kcal/min (not significant) on day 28 with FctO compared with OL consumption. Similarly, average fat oxidation was greater (p = 0.052) with FctO compared with OL intake on day 2 but not day 28. DISCUSSION: Consumption of a diet rich in MCTs results in greater loss of AT compared with LCTs, perhaps due to increased energy expenditure and fat oxidation observed with MCT intake. Thus, MCTs may be considered as agents that aid in the prevention of obesity or potentially stimulate weight loss.",

Each group included 10 neonates, and all tolerated the total parenteral nutrition well. The relative contents of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid increased in all lipid esters in plasma and adipose tissue in both groups, indicating that the content of these fatty acids is sufficient even in the medium-chain triglycerides emulsion. The serum concentration of ketones was within normal limits. Free fatty acids in plasma did not increase in either group. The total plasma carnitine concentration decreased in both groups but the distribution of free carnitine and acylcarnitine did not change. The total muscle carnitine did not change significantly but the ratio of acylcarnitine to free carnitine tended to increase in muscle in the treatment group, probably an effect of the medium-chain triglyceride supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The two groups displayed the same fatty acid pattern in plasma and adipose tissue and the same respiratory quotient during the treatment period. Regarding carnitine status, essentially the same changes were seen in the two groups. However, discrete changes were seen in muscle tissue in the treatment group.",

      "abstract": "Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are readily oxidized in the liver. Animal and human studies have shown that the fast rate of oxidation of MCFA leads to greater energy expenditure (EE). Most animal studies have also demonstrated that the greater EE with MCFA relative to long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) results in less body weight gain and decreased size of fat depots after several months of consumption. Furthermore, both animal and human trials suggest a greater satiating effect of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) compared with long-chain triglycerides (LCT). The aim of this review is to evaluate existing data describing the effects of MCT on EE and satiety and determine their potential efficacy as agents in the treatment of human obesity. Animal studies are summarized and human trials more systematically evaluated because the primary focus of this article is to examine the effects of MCT on human energy metabolism and satiety. Hormones including cholescytokinin, peptide YY, gastric inhibitory peptide, neurotensin and pancreatic polypeptide have been proposed to be involved in the mechanism by which MCT may induce satiety; however, the exact mechanisms have not been established. From the literature reviewed, we conclude that MCT increase energy expenditure, may result in faster satiety and facilitate weight control when included in the diet as a replacement for fats containing LCT.",

The experimental design consisted of three intervention periods of 2 weeks separated by washout periods of 2 or 6 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, and crossover design. Seven male and 14 female normal to moderately obese subjects (mean+/-S.D.; age, 43+/-10 years; body mass index, 27.6+/-2.0 kg/m(2)) participated in this study. Subjects consumed three self-selected meals and four isoenergetic snacks daily with either no supplementation (PLA), with 500 mg HCA (HCA), or 500 mg HCA and 3 g MCT (HCA+MCT). Each intervention period ended with a test day, consisting of a standardized breakfast and ad libitum a lunch and a dinner. There was a significant body weight (BW) loss during the 2 weeks of intervention (PLA, -0.5+/-0.3 kg, P<.05; HCA, -0.4+/-0.2 kg, P<.05; HCA+MCT, -0.7+/-0.2 kg, P<.01), but this reduction was not different between treatments. Twenty-four-hour energy intake (PLA, 8.1+/-0.3 MJ; HCA, 8.3+/-0.3 MJ; HCA+MCT, 8.4+/-0.3 MJ) and the area under the curve of the appetite-related parameters during the test day were similar for all treatments. Two weeks of supplementation with HCA and HCA combined with MCT did not result in increased satiety or decreased energy intake compared to placebo in subjects losing BW.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are energetically less dense, highly ketogenic, and more easily oxidised than long chain triglycerides (LCT). MCT also differ from LCT in their digestive and metabolic pathways. OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of MCT supplementation during a very low calorie diet (VLCD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three groups of tightly matched obese women with body mass index (BMI)>30 kg/m(2) received an isoenergetic (578.5 kcal) VLCD (Adinax, Novo Vital, Sweden) enriched with MCT or LCT (8.0 and 9.9 g/100 g Adinax respectively) or a low-fat (3 g/100 g) and high-carbohydrate regimen. The diets were administered over 4 weeks. Body composition was measured with DEXA and appetite/satiety-according to Blundell. Beta hydroxybutyric acid concentration in plasma and nitrogen excretion in urine was measured during consecutive days of VLCD. The study was performed in a randomised double-blind manner. RESULTS: The MCT group showed a significantly greater decrease in body weight during the first 2 weeks. The contribution of body fat to the total weight loss was higher while the contribution of fat-free mass (FFM) was lower. The MCT group had a higher concentration of ketone bodies in plasma and a lower nitrogen excretion in urine. Hunger feelings were less intense while satiety was higher. These differences were observed during the first 2 weeks of treatment and gradually declined during the third and fourth weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Replacement of LCT by MCT in the VLCD increased the rate of decrease of body fat and body weight and has a sparing effect on FFM. The intensity of hunger feelings was lower and paralleled the higher increase of ketone bodies. These effects gradually declined, indicating subsequent metabolic adaptation. Further studies are required to confirm the protein-sparing and appetite-suppressing effects of MCT supplementation during the first 2 weeks of VLCD treatment.",

We analyzed retrospectively the charts of 6 patients seen in our tertiary care center and of 11 comparable patients from the literature. All neonates were symptomatic at birth; 15 had bilateral chylothorax. In the neonates who received mainly TPN (n = 9), the chylothorax resolved significantly (p < 0.05) earlier (mean 10 days, SE 1) than in the others, who received mainly MCT (n = 8) (mean 23 days, SE 4). The mean chyle loss was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Our results suggest that TPN is more effective than oral MCT in the treatment of spontaneous congenital chylothorax. These results support the data of Peitersen et al, who reported that most of the positive results with MCT were achieved in postoperative chylothorax of the newborn.",

      "abstract": "We have studied the underlying molecular defect in a patient presenting with recurrent pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, and virtually undetectable postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mass and activity, who normalized her triglycerides 3 to 6 months after initiation of either medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil or omega-3 fatty acid (omega-3-FA) therapy. After treatment, postheparin plasma LPL activity and mass ranged from 24% to 39% of normal and LPL specific activity was normal (1.0 nmol.ng-1.min-1). On discontinuation of MCT oil or omega-3-FA, plasma triglyceride increased to > 2000 mg/dL. Northern blotting revealed both normal size and abundance of LPL mRNA isolated from adipocytes as well as macrophages. Sequence analysis of the LPL gene, which included all 10 exons, intron-exon splice junctions, and 1.7 kb of the 5'-flanking region, and of LPL cDNA failed to identify any mutations. ApoC-II activity and mass assays revealed the presence of normal levels of a fully functional cofactor as well as the absence of circulating plasma inhibitors of lipase function. In summary, we describe a unique patient presenting with classical features of the familial chylomicronemia syndrome who manifests an unusually beneficial therapeutic response to MCT oil and omega-3-FA therapy. Unlike that in most patients with LPL deficiency, the chylomicronemia in this patient is not caused by a mutation in the structural LPL gene but possibly by a posttranscriptional defect. Thus, a subset of LPL-deficient patients with unique genetic defects respond to therapy by normalizing fasting plasma triglycerides; a therapeutic trial with MCT oil should be considered in all patients presenting with the familial chylomicronemia syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Lipid peroxidation may be important in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury. We investigated the potential of medium chain triglycerides and vitamin E to decrease lipid peroxidation and reverse established alcoholic liver injury. Four groups (five rats/group) of male Wistar rats were studied. Rats in group 1 were fed a fish oil-ethanol diet for 6 weeks. Rats in groups 2, 3 and 4 were fed the fish oil-ethanol diet for 6 weeks before being switched to fish oil-dextrose (group 2), fish oil-dextrose plus vitamin E (group 3) or medium chain triglycerides-dextrose (group 4) diets for 2 weeks. Liver samples were analyzed for histopathology, lipid peroxidation, fatty acid composition and cytochrome P450 2E1 activity. By 6 weeks, all rats developed fatty liver, inflammation and necrosis. After switching to the dextrose-containing diets, there was minimal histologic improvement in group 2, moderate improvement in group 3 and near normalization of the histology in group 4. Histologic improvement was associated with decreased lipid peroxidation and cytochrome P450 2E1 activity. Higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids were seen in groups 2 and 3 than in group 4. Our results indicate that a diet enriched in saturated (group 4) but not polyunsaturated (group 2) fatty acids effectively reverses alcoholic liver injury. Treatment with vitamin E also led to histologic improvement. These effects may be explained, at least in part, by down-regulation of lipid peroxidation. Other effects of medium chain triglycerides, such as their propensity for oxidation rather than esterification, may also be important.",

      "abstract": "Over the last two decades, the clinical use of intravenous fat emulsions for the nutritional support of hospitalized patients has become routine. During this time long-chain triglycerides (LCT) derived from soybean and/or safflower oils were the exclusive lipid source for these emulsions, providing both a safe calorically dense alternative to dextrose and essential fatty acids needed for biologic membranes and the maintenance of immune function. During the past decade, the availability of novel experimental triglycerides for parenteral use has generated interest in the use of these substrates for nutritional and metabolic support. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), long advocated as a superior substrate for parenteral use, possess many unique physiochemical and metabolic properties that make them theoretically advantageous over their LCT counterparts. Although not yet approved in the United States, preparations containing MCT have been widely available in Europe. Intravenous MCT preparations, either as physical mixtures or structured lipids, have been used clinically in patients with immunosuppresion, critical illness, liver and pulmonary disease and in premature infants. Despite great promise, the clinical data comparing the efficacy of MCT-based lipid emulsions to their LCT counterparts has been equivocal. This may be due in part to the limited nature of the published clinical trials. Measures of efficacy for parenteral or enteral nutritional products has taken on new meaning, in light of the reported experience using immunomodulatory nutrients. Current concerns about cost of medical care and resource use warrant careful deliberation about the utility of any new and expensive therapy. Until clinical data can fulfill expectations derived from animal studies, it is difficult to advocate the general use of MCT-based lipid emulsions. Future clinical studies with MCT-based emulsions should have clear outcome objectives sufficient to prove their theorized metabolic superiority.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown in an acute inpatient setting that dietary substitution of 77.5% of fat kcal as medium chain triglycerides (MCT) increased insulin-mediated glucose metabolism in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and that this effect appeared to be mediated by increases in insulin-mediated glucose disposal. The purpose of this study was to test the application of dietary substitution of medium chain triglycerides as an adjunctive tool in ambulatory therapy of NIDDM. METHODS: Five subjects with NIDDM underwent a baseline 6 hour insulin/glucose euglycemic clamp study, with simultaneous 3H-glucose infusion for calculation of glucose disposal rate and hepatic glucose output. Subjects were then randomized to begin one of two 30-day experimental diets, with long chain (LCT) or medium chain triglycerides (MCT), and subsequent crossover to the other diet. A 6 hour euglycemic clamp was repeated after each diet phase. RESULTS: Diet records and urinary organic acid excretion indicated a high level of dietary compliance by the study participants. Postprandial blood glucose excursions were less after one month on the diet with MCT than after the LCT diet (p = 0.004). However, fasting serum glucose, serum fructosamine (a measure of glycemia), fasting insulin, hepatic glucose output, and insulin-mediated glucose metabolism were not improved by the dietary substitution of MCT. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that supplementation of a tolerable amount of MCT in a conventional diabetic exchange diet has little impact on glycemic control in subjects with NIDDM in an ambulatory setting.",

      "abstract": "This experiment was conducted to determine whether feeding medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) to sows during late gestation and early lactation would improve neonatal pig survival. Beginning on d 91 of gestation and continuing through d 7 of lactation, sows were fed isoenergetic (7,000 kcal of ME/d) and isonitrogenous (278 g of CP/d) amounts of either control (19% starch, 2% soybean oil), long-chain triglycerides (LCT, soybean oil, 12%), or MCT (10% MCT, 2% soybean oil) diets. Sows (n = 18, 19, and 17, respectively) were induced to farrow on d 112 of gestation. Litters were weighed at birth, before suckling, and on d 1, 3, 7, and 21 of lactation. There was no effect of treatment on average pig weight at any time and no difference in the number of live pigs at birth. Beginning on d 3 (P < .05) and continuing through weaning (d 21, P < .02) survival was improved in litters from sows fed MCT relative to litters from sows fed the control diet. Overall survival rates were 80, 81, and 90% in control, LCT, and MCT groups, respectively. The greatest improvement in survival was observed in pigs weighing < 900 g at birth. Survival of pigs in this weight range was 32, 53, and 68% in control, LCT, and MCT treatments, respectively. Although feeding MCT resulted in an increase in content of medium-chain fatty acids in milk, these accounted for < 5% of the fatty acids in milk and likely cannot account for the improved survival rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Thirty-six adult severe head injury and cerebral stroke patients in four intensive-care units were randomized to receive one of three enteral diets for 21 days. These diets, which supplied 45% of calories from fat, differed only in lipid composition. Diet A was comprised of 100% soybean oil, diet B contained a 50:50 (wt/wt) mixture of soybean oil and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), and diet C contained 42.5% MCT, 50% soybean oil, and 7.5% blackcurrant seed oils. Plasma phosphatidylcholine and fatty acid composition of plasma total phospholipids were determined before initiating treatment (day 0) and weekly throughout the study. Results indicated that at the start of the study, all patients had low linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6) levels compared with healthy subjects. Emulsion A disturbed the balance between several fatty acids of the omega 6 series, as exemplified by the significant increase in 18:2 omega 6 proportions. In contrast, both emulsions B and C introduced a less-pronounced rise in 18:2 omega 6 associated for emulsion C with a significant increase in dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3 omega 6) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5 omega 3) in plasma phospholipids. Furthermore, 18:3 omega 6 change was significantly different between groups A and C and that of 20:3 omega 6 between group A and both groups B and C. Throughout the study, arachidonic acid (20:4 omega 6) exhibited remarkable steady-state levels regardless of the diet. This study shows that providing the injured body with high amounts of 18:2 omega 6 does not lead to high levels of its upper derivatives in plasma phospholipids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Four trials were conducted using 86, 24-h-old pigs to evaluate the utilization of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). Effects of emulsification and amount of MCT fed were examined. After a 4-h period during which feed was withheld, pigs were force-fed MCT (containing 75% octanoate and 25% decanoate), marking time 0 of the experiment. Blood samples were obtained at 1 and 2 h for subsequent medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) analysis. In Trials 1 (six pigs/treatment) and 2 (four pigs/treatment) the response to three emulsifying agents was compared to a nonemulsified (NE) control. Twenty milliliters of a 30% (vol/vol) emulsion of MCT or 6 mL of NE MCT was administered. Concentrations of MCFA at 1 h in pigs receiving a Tween 80 (polyoxy-ethylene [20] sorbitan monooleate) emulsion were 3- to 19-fold higher than concentrations in animals administered a gum arabic/gum tragacanth emulsion, a lecithin emulsion, or NE MCT. Trials 3 (eight pigs/treatment) and 4 (six pigs/treatment) were conducted to determine the plasma MCFA concentrations resulting from feeding increasing levels of NE (3, 6, 9, or 12 mL of MCT) or emulsified MCT oil (2, 4, 6, or 8 mL in a 30% Tween 80 emulsion). Plasma octanoate concentrations measured at 1 h increased linearly (P < .05) with increasing MCT dosage through 9 mL of NE and 6 mL of emulsified MCT. A transient narcosis was observed in 8 of 12 animals that received 6 or 8 mL of emulsified MCT and was most pronounced 1 to 2 h after feeding, which roughly corresponded to peak plasma MCFA concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Dietary medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may improve insulin-mediated glucose metabolism. To examine this possibility, 10 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients, 4 hypertriglyceridemic, and 6 normotriglyceridemic nondiabetic control subjects were examined with a 5-day cross-over design, in which the short-term metabolic effects of a 40% fat diet containing 77.5% of fat calories as MCT were compared with an isocaloric long-chain triglyceride-containing diet. In diabetic patients, MCT failed to alter fasting serum glucose concentrations but reduced preprandial glycemic excursions by 45% (F = 7.9, P less than 0.01). On MCT, the amount of glucose needed to maintain euglycemia during an intravenous insulin infusion was increased in diabetic subjects by 30%, in hypertriglyceridemic subjects by 30%, and in normotriglyceridemic control subjects by 17%. MCT increased mean +/- SE insulin-mediated glucose disposal (4.52 +/- 0.56 vs. 2.89 +/- 0.21 mg.kg-1.min-1; n = 3, P less than 0.05) but failed to alter basal glucose metabolism or insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output. Metabolic responses to MCT were observed independent of sulfonylurea therapy or severity of fasting hyperglycemia. No change in fasting serum insulin or triglyceride concentrations were seen with MCT administration. Although MCT increased mean fasting serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels from 0.10 +/- 0.03 to 0.26 +/- 0.06 mM (P less than 0.05) in normotriglyceridemic nondiabetic subjects, no change was seen in diabetic patients. Thus, MCT-containing diets increased insulin-mediated glucose metabolism in both diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects. In diabetic subjects, this effect appears to be mediated by increases in insulin-mediated glucose disposal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "A 9-y-old girl with ethylmalonic/adipic aciduria was hospitalized to determine the possible therapeutic efficacy of oral carnitine and glycine supplementation. To provoke a mild metabolic stress, her diet was supplemented with 440 mg/kg/d of medium-chain triglycerides. She was treated successively with carnitine (100 mg/kg/d) for 5 d, neither carnitine nor glycine for 2 d, and then glycine (250 mg/kg/d) for 6 d. Consecutive 12-h urine collections were obtained throughout the entire period. The urinary excretion of eight organic acids, four acylglycines, and four acylcarnitines, which accumulate as a result of a metabolic block of five mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, were quantitatively determined by capillary gas chromatography, stable isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and radioisotopic exchange HPLC, respectively. The excretion of each group of metabolites was calculated as the mean percentage of total output (mumol/24 h) during the four phases of the protocol (organic acids/acylglycines/acylcarnitines = 100.0%): 1) regular diet (3 d); 88.1/10.8/1.1; 2) medium-chain triglyceride supplementation (4); 82.5/15.6/1.9; 3) medium-chain triglycerides plus carnitine (5); 79.2/8.2/12.6; and 4) medium-chain triglycerides plus glycine (6); 81.0/18.7/0.3. Comparison between total and individual excretion of acylglycines and acylcarnitines indicates that oral glycine supplementation enhanced the conjugation and excretion of fatty acyl-CoA intermediates as efficiently as carnitine. We propose that oral glycine supplementation should be considered in the treatment of other inborn errors of metabolism associated with abnormal urinary excretion of acylglycines.",
