      "abstract": "This study examined the effects of replacing corn with an aged brown rice (ABR)-wheat mixture (ABR: wheat = 85%:15%) on laying performance, egg quality, yolk fatty acid profile, economic benefits, serum biochemistry, and nutrient digestibility in laying ducks. A 12-week trial with six hundred 32-week-old Jinding ducks were randomly divided into five groups, with 10 replicates per group, and each replicate contained 12 ducks. The levels of ABR-wheat mixture in the diet were 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, and 50%, respectively, to replace equal amounts of corn. The basic diet of the control group was corn-soybean meal (corn accounted for 50%). The experimental period was 12 weeks (from 32 to 43 weeks old). No significant differences were observed in laying performances (p > 0.05). From a numerical perspective, the duck-housed laying rate and egg mass were highest in the 37.5% group and lowest in the 50% group. Yolk color declined linearly (p < 0.05) over 12 weeks. The albumen height and Haugh unit showed a quadratic increase in weeks 4 and 8 (p < 0.05). The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) increased linearly (p < 0.05), while the relative content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), ω-3 PUFA, ω-6 PUFA, and ω-6/ω-3 PUFA decreased linearly in egg yolks (p < 0.05). The triglycerides (TG) content in serum showed a significant secondary change (p < 0.05), with the 50% group significantly lower than the other treatment groups (p < 0.05). The apparent digestibility of ether extract (EE) in the diets decreased linearly (p < 0.05). The apparent digestibility of crude protein (CP) in the diets was significantly reduced with the 50% group (p < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the 0% and 37.5% groups (p > 0.05). Compared with the control group, economic analysis revealed net gains of 0.04-0.10 USD/duck at ≤37.5% substitution, but a loss (-0.04 USD) at 50%. In conclusion, the ABR-wheat mixture could reduce the yolk color and yolk PUFA content, but it could improve albumen quality and increase yolk MUFA content. High-level ABR-wheat mixture (50%) significantly reduced the TG content in serum and nutrient digestibility of the diet and also showed a numerical decrease in laying rate and egg mass. Our findings suggest that up to a 37.5% ABR-wheat mixture can effectively replace corn in laying duck diets without negatively affecting laying performance, while improving albumen quality and altering yolk fatty acid composition."

The results revealed a significant increase in germination rate, from 62 % to 84 %, at the 12th hour after exposure to a 100-V MEF. This enhancement was attributed to an increase in cell membrane permeability, a crucial factor in MEF-induced germination. The MEF may induce the formation of reversible electrical pores, thereby increasing cell membrane permeability. Concurrently, MEF treatment triggered the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress, which has sustained membrane permeability during germination. Furthermore, MEF was found to enhance the antioxidant system, aiding in the elimination of excessive ROS and ensuring normal metabolic activities. These findings underscore the role of MEF in modulating BR germination and highlight its potential for practical applications in agricultural seed technology.",

Ultrasonic low-frequency sound waves (40 kHz) treatment of seeds is a green technology that promises to enhance germination capacity of the grains and functional and biochemical properties through the stimulation of water-oxygen uptake and seed metabolism. Ultrasonication treatment (5, 10 and 15 min) significantly enhanced the protein and total dietary fibre content of (brown rice) BR from different varieties. Results showed that ultrasonication accelerated starch and phytic acid degradation and increased the reduced sugar content via activation of alpha-amylase. Moreover, the ultrasonically treated BR had higher levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, essential amino acids and other bioactive compounds. Ultrasonicated germinated grain can be utilize further by food industry for making functional foods.

TLC-ImageJ demonstrated high accuracy and linearity, with a relative error of 5.00 %-11.16 % and an R2 value of 0.9943. The highest GABA content was 258.03 mg/kg in paddy found at 65 °C, 20 % and 5 h. GABA was primarily produced in the germ and migrated inward during the enrichment process. The highest GABA content in paddy with different degrees of milling was observed at 6 h, but the mobility remained stable after 4 h, and the migration of GABA produced by the germ to endosperm reached 87.37 %. Conclusively, the HHT can produce GABA-enriched rice, while the TLC-ImageJ provided a rapid and accurate approach for quantitatively determining GABA content.",

This study investigated the bioactive compound profile of water extracts from beverage powder made from Thai germinated brown rice (GBRE) and assessed its anticancer effects on cholangiocarcinoma, lung cancer, and liver cancer cell lines. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) revealed 23 metabolites, including amino acids, sugar, phenolic compounds and nitrogenous compounds. Additionally, GBRE exhibited anticancer properties by effectively inhibiting cancer cell growth, inducing cell cycle arrest, and reducing cell migration. Our findings highlight the nutritional benefits and anticancer potential of germinated brown rice powder in impeding cancer cell progression. This study demonstrates the nutritional benefits and anticancer effects of germinated brown rice powder in inhibiting cancer cell progression.

      "abstract": "Purpose: This study explores the impact of brown rice bran powder (BRBP), known for its beneficial components, such as dietary fiber and γ-oryzanol, on individuals suffering from metabolic syndrome (MetS). Subjects/Methods: In this eight-week open-label controlled trial, fifty participants with MetS were randomly assigned to either a control group, which received a standard diet (SDiet), or an intervention group, which incorporated 15 grams of BRBP daily into their diet. Demographic, anthropometric and clinical data were collected, and blood samples were taken to assess metabolic factors and antioxidant enzyme activities. Additionally, the participants completed the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale questionnaire. Results: Analysis of covariance controlled for the baseline levels and medication consumptions revealed that postthis trial, compared to the controls, patients who received BRBP showed significant reductions in BMI (P-value = 0.001; effect size (ES): -1.13), waist circumference (P-value < 0.001; ES: -1.28), total-cholesterol (P-value = 0.028; ES: -0.74), LDL-cholesterol (P-value = 0.002; ES: -0.86), blood sugar (P-value = 0.013; ES: -0.82), as well as triglyceride glucose (TyG)-BMI index (as a marker of insulin resistance) (P-value < 0.001; ES: -1.35). Further, BRBP resulted in significant improvements in antioxidant enzyme activities, including glutathione peroxidase (P-value = 0.010; ES: 0.86), superoxide dismutase serum activities (P-value = 0.021; ES: 0.78), and constipation rate (P-value = 0.018; ES: -0.85) compared to SDiet alone. However, no significant changes were found regarding levels of triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, glutathione, catalase and blood pressure after the trial. Conclusion: The findings of this trial support the weight-reducing, hypocholestrolemic, anti-hyperglycemic, and antioxidative effects of adding BRBP to SDiet that is prescribed for MetS patients.",

      "abstract": "Germinated whole seeds possess elevated levels of bioactive nutrients; however, their application is hindered by several constraints. The germination process is typically time-consuming, and germinated seeds present challenges in terms of storage and transportation compared to dry seeds. This study introduces a novel processing method for rice, termed prolonged priming (PLP), aiming to combine the benefits of germinated and dry seeds. PLP involves soaking the seeds until the embryo exposure stage, followed by redrying. At 10 h (hour) germination post PLP, the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in Hanyou73 (HY73) and IRAT exceeded 20 mg/100 g. Additionally, there was an induction of various nutrient components, including an increase in protein content, a reduction in amylose levels, and an elevation in fatty acid content, among others. Malondialdehyde levels, indicating oxidative damage, remained stable, and PLP preserved better seed integrity compared to routine priming in the desiccation-tolerant HY73. Collectively, the PLP treatment demonstrates an optimization of the nutritional value and storage in germinated brown rice (GBR). This novel process holds potential for enhancing the nutritional profile of GBR and may be applicable to other crop species."

The medium moisture content (20 %) allowed the highest pasting viscosity and a uniform network structure of cooked BR. Prolonging the HMT time from 1.0 h to 2.0 h at medium moisture content hindered starch swelling and improved stability. Meanwhile, the relative crystallinity, the surface compactness in nanoscale and R995/1022 decreased, while the gel network structure was improved, contributing to the softened cooked BR texture and the enhanced starch digestibility. Although the resistant starch content raised to 13.55 % after 3.0 h of HMT, the springiness, gumminess and chewiness of cooked BR degraded, and this should be considered in certain conditions.",

Seven freeze-thaw cycles exhibited more pronounced effects compared to 7 days of freezing, resulting in increases in GBR hardness by 85.59 %-164.36 % and decreases in stickiness by 10.34 %-43.55 %. Water loss, structural damage of GBR flour, and starch retrogradation contributed to the deterioration of texture. MF mitigated these effects by inhibiting the transformation of bound water into free water, reducing water loss by 0.39 %-0.57 %, and shortening the phase transition period by 2.0-21.5 min, thereby diminishing structural damage to GBR flour and hindering starch retrogradation. Following MF treatment (5 mT), GBR hardness decreased by 21.00 %, while stickiness increased by 45.71 %.

This study aimed to explore the hypolipidemic effects of autoclaving-treated germinated brown rice (AGBR) and the underlying mechanisms involving gut microbiota. METHODS: Dietary intervention with AGBR or polished rice (PR) was implemented in patients with hyperlipidemia for 3 months, and blood lipids were analyzed. Nutritional characteristics of AGBR and PR were measured and compared. Additionally, 16S rDNA sequencing was performed to reveal the differences in gut microbiota between the AGBR and PR groups. RESULTS: AGBR relieves hyperlipidemia in patients, as evidenced by reduced levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein-B, and elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein-A1. In terms of nutrition, AGBR had significantly higher concentrations of free amino acids (10/16 species), γ-aminobutyric acid, resistant starch, soluble dietary fiber, and flavonoids (11/13 species) than PR. In addition, higher microbial abundance, diversity, and uniformity were observed in the AGBR group than in the PR group. At the phylum level, AGBR reduced Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Desulfobacterota, and Synergistota, and elevated Bacteroidota and Verrucomicrobiota. At the genus level, AGBR elevated Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Dialister, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium, and reduced Escherichia-Shigella, Blautia, Romboutsia, and Turicibacter. DISCUSSION: AGBR contributes to the remission of hyperlipidemia by modulating the gut microbiota."

The effect of the molecular structure of extruded pregelatinization starch on the dough's rheological properties and the brown rice bread's quality was investigated. Extruded rice starch (ERS) was prepared with various added moisture contents of 20 % (ERS20), 30 % (ERS30), and 40 % (ERS40), respectively. ERS had smaller molecular weight and more short branched chains as the moisture content decreased. The dough elasticity and deformation resistance were improved with the ERS supplementation and in the order of ERS40 > ERS30 > ERS20 at the same level. Fortification with ERS improved the gluten-free brown rice bread quality. Compared to the control group, breadcrumbs supplemented with ERS20 at the 10 % level showed an increase in cell density from 17.87 cm-2 to 28.32 cm-2, a decrease in mean cell size from 1.22 mm2 to 0.81 mm2, and no significant change in cell area fraction. In addition, the specific volume increased from 1.50 cm3/g to 2.04 cm3/g, the hardness decreased from 14.34 N to 6.28 N, and the springiness increased from 0.56 to 0.74. The addition of extruded pregelatinization starches with smaller molecular weights and higher proportions of short chains is promising for preparing high-quality gluten-free bread.",

Texture profile analysis (TPA) revealed that increasing plant protein levels hardened the hybrid meat batters, with PA and PB leading to the hardest gels. TPA results were supported by micrographs, demonstrating that the two pea proteins formed large aggregates, contributing to a firmer hybrid meat gel. Dynamic rheology showed that the incorporation of plant proteins lowered the storage modulus (G') during the heating stage (20 to 72°C), yet the 6% PA treatment produced a final G' (after cooling) closest to the control (CL). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) T2 relaxometry also demonstrated that plant proteins reduced the water mobility in hybrid meat batters. Results were in line with the cooking loss, except for a higher cooking loss in the BR formulation compared to the CL. Color measurement showed that increasing plant protein levels led to darker and yellower meat batters; however, the effect on redness varied among treatments. Overall, the findings suggest that pea proteins have superior functionality and compatibility within a lean poultry meat protein system, compared to BR and FB tested here.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to observe the effects of germinated brown rice and germinated black rice on blood lipid levels, blood glucose levels and lipid metabolism-related enzymes in T2DM patients with dyslipidaemia and to study their effects on the gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids. Methods: According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 68 subjects were randomly divided into a germinated brown rice group, a germinated black rice group and a white rice group. At the end of the intervention, relevant anthropometric indices, blood biochemistry, and levels of adipokines and lipid metabolism-related enzymes were measured. Faecal samples were collected for 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing and for an analysis of short-chain fatty acids. Results: After 3 months of intervention with germinated brown rice, germinated black rice or white rice, 21 people in each group completed the intervention as required. At the end of the intervention, the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the germinated brown rice group and germinated black rice group were significantly lower than those in the white rice group. The levels of adiponectin (ADPN) and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in the germinated brown rice group were significantly higher than those in the white rice group (P < 0.05). At the genus level, interventions with germinated brown rice and germinated black rice significantly increased the relative abundance of Megamonas, Muribaculaceae and Alloprevotella and significantly decreased the relative abundance of Veillonella (P < 0.05). After 3 months of intervention, a significant decrease in waist circumference was observed within the germinated brown rice group compared to that at baseline (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Compared with the consumption of white rice, the consumption of germinated brown rice and germinated black rice can effectively regulate the glucose and lipid metabolism of this population. In addition, interventions involving the use of germinated brown rice and germinated black rice may further improve intestinal diversity and abundance, increase the relative abundance of Megamonas and decrease the relative abundance of Veillonella.",

      "abstract": "The pretreatment process of various foods has been reported to improve their nutritional properties. The soaking of brown rice improves the texture and nutrients, which are crucial for cooking and maintaining its high functional value. Illite, a clay mineral, has recently been discovered to improve the nutritional value of seeds. Based on these findings, we soaked brown rice with different concentrations of illite solution for different durations and allowed the germination to perform analyses. Soaking the brown rice for 6 h with a germination period of 48 h was determined to be the optimal condition because of its higher sprout length. In addition, this optimal condition had improved textural characteristics such as reduced hardness, gumminess, chewiness, and cohesiveness, and it also had increased adhesiveness and stabilized resilience and springiness. The treatment solutions were free from heavy metal contaminants, whereas the mineral contents such as K, Ca, Fe, Mg, and Na were significantly increased with the increase in illite concentration. Moreover, our results showed that illite treatment could preserve the color appearance and seed germination. The ratio of essential amino acids to non-essential amino acids and antioxidants (phenolic contentγ-oryzanol, and flavonoid) of germinated brown rice was considerably increased with illite treatment. In germinated brown rice, an increase in DPPH and superoxide dismutase levels, a slight decrease in flavonoids, and no difference in polyphenol content were observed. These findings suggest that pre-soaking brown rice seeds with the appropriate concentration of illite could enhance their nutritional properties, which might attract consumers' interest to include this in their daily diet."

Here, edible oils (pork lard and corn oil, 1-5 wt%) were incorporated during the cooking of BR following heat moisture treatment. Incorporating corn oil rather than lard significantly ameliorated the texture properties (e.g. hardness, cohesiveness, and chewiness) and sensory properties of cooked BR. Both lard- and corn oil-incorporated cooked BR showed obvious structural changes accompanied by the formation of amylose-lipid complexes during cooking. It was confirmed that the incorporation of lard and corn oil allowed a higher degree of short-range molecular order, more V-type starch crystallites, and elevated nano-structural arrangements. Additionally, a decreased hardness (from 559.04 g to 424.18 g and 385.91 g, respectively) and enriched resistant starch (RS) were also observed, the highest RS content (15.95 % and 16.32 %, respectively) was observed when 1 wt% of lard and corn oil were incorporated.",

      "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia is a common clinical disorder of lipid metabolism in modern society and is considered to be one of the major risk factors leading to cardiovascular-related diseases. Germinated brown rice (GBR) is a typical whole grain food. The lipid-lowering effect of GBR has received increasing attention, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. The gut microbiota has been proposed as a novel target for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GBR on the gut microbiota and lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice. The effect of GBR on hyperlipidemia was evaluated by measuring blood lipid levels and by pathological examination. The gut microbiota was detected by 16S rRNA sequencing, and the protein and mRNA expression levels involved in cholesterol metabolism were detected by western blotting and RT-qPCR to find potential correlations. The results showed that GBR supplementation could effectively reduce the levels of TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C in the serum and alleviate the excessive accumulation of fat droplets caused by HFD. Moreover, GBR intervention improved HFD-fed gut microbiota disorder via increasing the diversity of the gut microbiota, reducing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and improving gut barrier damage. In addition, GBR could inhibit endogenous cholesterol synthesis and promote cholesterol transport and excretion. These findings suggest that GBR may be a competitive candidate for the development of functional foods to prevent abnormal lipid metabolism.",

In Exp. 1, 18 Landrace × Yorkshire (L × Y) barrows with an initial body weight (IBW) of 25.48 ± 3.21 kg were randomly assigned to three treatments, including a corn-based diet, one-year-stored brown rice (BR1) diet, and six-year-stored brown rice (BR6) diet, to determine the digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) values of stored brown rice. In Exp. 2, 24 barrows (L × Y; IBW: 22.16 ± 2.42 kg) fixed with ileal T-cannula were randomly allotted to four dietary treatments, including a corn diet, two stored brown rice diets, and a nitrogen-free diet, to evaluate the amino acid (AA) digestibility of the stored brown rice. In Exp. 3 and 4, 108 crossbred weaned piglets (L × Y; IBW: 9.16 ± 0.89 kg) and 90 crossbred growing pigs (L × Y; IBW: 48.28 ± 3.51 kg) were allotted to three treatment diets, including a control diet and two stored brown rice diets, respectively, to investigate the application of stored brown rice in weaned piglets and fully grown pig diets. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the DE and ME values between corn and stored brown rice (p > 0.05), while the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of arginine, histidine, asparagine + aspartic acid (Asx), and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of arginine and histidine were higher in the stored brown rice diet compared to the corn diet (p < 0.05). Compared to the corn, the stored brown rice showed no significant effects on growth performance, nutrient-apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD), and serum biochemical indices (p > 0.05) but showed decreased activity in the various digestive enzymes in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of the weaned piglets (p < 0.05). Also, the stored brown rice diet showed no significant effects on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, as well as the fatty acid profiles in the longissimus dorsi muscle of fully grown pigs compared with the corn diet (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the brown rice stored for 6 years under good conditions had no obvious changes in the available energy and nutrient values. Although it may reduce digestive enzyme activity in the small intestines of the piglets, the stored brown rice showed no obvious adverse effects on growth performance and meat quality and can be effectively used in pig diets."

The cooking treatment (boiling with water at 100 °C for 12 min) evidenced an important extraction capacity of the boiling water over aflatoxins (25 %-56 %), that was higher for brown rice. Moreover, aflatoxins G1 and G2 were unstable with losses around 35 %. The highest bioaccessibility percentage was obtained for white rice (60 %-83 %) compared to brown rice (28 %-47 %), due to aflatoxin losses from brown rice after the gastric step.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, germinated brown rice (GBR) has gained substantial attention as a functional food because of its nutritional attributes. Notably, pulsed light technology (PLT) has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing rice germination and, consequently, has improved the nutritional and functional qualities of GBR-derived products. However, further research is required to comprehensively understand the impact of PLT on GBR physicochemical properties. The present study aimed to investigate the stimulating effects of PLT on starch hydrolysis, starch structure and functional properties of GBR. RESULTS: The PLT substantially boosted α-amylase activity during brown rice germination, leading to a 10.9% reduction in total starch content and a 17.3% increase in reducing sugar content, accompanied by elevated free water levels. Structural analysis indicated no changes in starch crystalline types, whereas gelatinization temperature slightly increased. Pasting properties exhibited a significant drop in peak viscosity. Scanning electron microscopy showed surface erosion of starch granules with microstructural changes. Furthermore, correlation analysis established positive links between α-amylase activity, reducing sugar accumulation, starch structure and functional properties in GBR. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that PLT enhanced the physicochemical properties of GBR starch, significantly improving the stability of GBR products, thereby contributing to expanded applicability of rice starch in the food industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Breeding rice varieties rich in flavonoids can prevent chronic diseases such as cancer and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. However, most of the genes reported are known to regulate flavonoid content in leaves or seedlings. To further elucidate the genetic basis of flavonoid content in rice grains and identify germplasm rich in flavonoids in grains, a set of rice core collections containing 633 accessions from 32 countries was used to determine total flavonoid content (TFC) in brown rice. We identified ten excellent germplasms with TFC exceeding 300 mg/100 g. Using a compressed mixed linear model, a total of 53 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). By combining linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis, location of significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gene expression, and haplotype analysis, eight candidate genes were identified from two important QTLs (qTFC1-6 and qTFC9-7), among which LOC_Os01g59440 and LOC_Os09g24260 are the most likely candidate genes. We also analyzed the geographic distribution and breeding utilization of favorable haplotypes of the two genes. Our findings provide insights into the genetic basis of TFC in brown rice and could facilitate the breeding of flavonoid-rich varieties, which may be a prevention and adjuvant treatment for cancer and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.",

Koshihikari. Particularly, the identification of bioactive compounds was confirmed using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (1H and 13C). Momilactone A (MA) and momilactone B (MB) amounts were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS), whereas other compounds were quantified by spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Accordingly, GBR under B2 treatment (75 mM salinity for 4 days) showed the greatest total phenolic and flavonoid contents (14.50 mg gallic acid and 11.06 mg rutin equivalents, respectively, per g dry weight). GBR treated with B2 also accumulated the highest quantities of MA, MB, ρ-coumaric, ferulic, cinnamic, salicylic acids, and tricin (18.94, 41.00, 93.77, 139.03, 46.05, 596.26, and 107.63 µg/g DW, respectively), which were consistent with the strongest antiradical activities in DPPH and ABTS assays (IC50 = 1.58 and 1.78 mg/mL, respectively).

In this study, the organic matter release capacities of five selected natural (milled rice and brown rice) and synthetic (PLA, PHA, PCL) SCSs were systematically investigated. The results showed that brown rice was the preferable SCS with high COD release potential, release rate and maximum accumulation of 309.2 mg-COD/g-SCS, 581.3 mg-COD/L·d and 6183.3 mg-COD/L, respectively. The cost for COD supply of brown rice stood at $1.0/kg-COD with considerable economic viability. The organic matter release process of brown rice could be well depicted by Hixson-Crowell model with a rate constant of -1.10. The addition of activated sludge could enhance the organic matter release of brown rice, evidenced by the increased release of VFAs with a proportion up to 97.1 % in the total organic matter. Moreover, the mass flow of carbon showed that the addition of activated sludge could improve the carbon utilization rate, and the peak value could achieve 45.4 % in 12 days. The unique dual-enzyme system, consisting of exogenous hydrolase from microorganisms in activated sludge and the endogenous amylase from brown rice, was supposed to be the main reason for the superior carbon release capacity of brown rice over other SCSs. This study was expected to offer an economic and effective SCS for the biological treatment of low-carbon wastewater.",

XRD and FTIR results showed ET, HMT-ET caused the transition of starch crystals from amorphous to crystalline region, suggesting the formation of the starch-lipid complex. The analysis of DSC and RVA proved HMT-ET flours induced starch gelatinization and inhibited the starch retrogradation of BRF compared with the other three flours. Correlation analysis suggested that the combined effect of HMT and ET was response for the changes in physicochemical properties and reduction of in vitro starch digestibility. Overall, the BRF after HMT-ET with improved physicochemical properties and starch digestibility could be better utilized as a good substitute for carbohydrate sources.",

      "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most economically and socially important cereals in the world. Several strategies such as biofortification have been developed in a way eco-friendly and sustainable to enhance crop productivity. This study implemented an agronomic itinerary in Ariete and Ceres rice varieties in experimental fields using the foliar application of selenium (Se) to increase rice nutritional value. At strategic phases of the plant's development (at the end of booting, anthesis, and at the milky grain stage), they were sprayed with sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) and sodium selenite (Na2SeO3). In the first foliar application plants were sprayed with 500 g Se·ha-1 and in the remaining two foliar applications were sprayed with 300 g Se·ha-1. The effects of Se in the level of micro and macronutrients in brown grains, the localization of Se in these grains, and the subsequent quality parameters such as colorimetric characteristics and total protein were considered. After grain harvesting, the application of selenite showed the highest enrichment in all grain with levels reaching 17.06 µg g-1 Se and 14.28 µg g-1 Se in Ariete and Ceres varieties, respectively. In the Ceres and Ariete varieties, biofortification significantly affected the K and P contents. Regarding Ca, a clear trend prevailed suggesting that Se antagonizes the uptake of it, while for the remaining elements in general (except Mn) no significant differences were noted. Protein content increased with selenite treatment in the Ariete variety but not in Ceres. Therefore, it was possible to conclude, without compromising quality, that there was an increase in the nutritional content of Se in brown rice grain."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brown rice (BR) has been considered as a potential strategy in improving T2DM. However, there are a lack of population-based trials on the association of Germinated brown rice (GBR) and diabetes. AIMS: We aimed to explore the influence of GBR diet in T2DM patients for 3 months and whether this effect relates to serum fatty acids. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty T2DM patients have been enrolled and eligible subjects (n = 112, 61 female, 51 male) were randomly divided into GBR intervention group (n = 56) and control group (n = 56). Except those who lost follow-up and withdrew, final GBR group and control group consisted of 42 and 43 patients, respectively. Participants in GBR group were asked to consume 100 g/d GBR instead of equal refined grain (RG) for 3 months, while control group maintain their usual eating habits. A structured questionnaire was used for demographic information at baseline, and basic indicators were measured both at the beginning and end of the trail to evaluate plasma glucose and lipids levels. RESULTS: In GBR group, mean dietary inflammation index (DII) decreased, indicating GBR intervention retarded patient inflammation. Besides, glycolipid related parameters, including FBG, HbA1c, TC and HDL, were all significantly lower than those in control group. Excitingly, fatty acid composition was changed by intake of GBR, especially n-3 PUFA and n-3/n-6 PUFA rate were significantly increased. Moreover, subjects in GBR group had higher levels of n-3 metabolites, such as RVE, MaR1 and PD1, reducing inflammatory effect. In contrast, n-6 metabolites, like LTB4 and PGE2 which could promote inflammatory effect, were lower in GBR group. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that diet with 100 g/d GBR for 3 months could really improve T2DM to some extent. This beneficial effect may be related to n-3 metabolites, namely inflammation changes.

      "abstract": "Hypertension leads to oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. The suppression of these indicators may be one treatment approach. Parboiled germinated brown rice (PGBR), obtained by steaming germinated Jasmine rice, reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in vivo. PGBR contains more bioactive compounds than brown rice (BR) and white rice (WR). Anti-hypertensive benefits of PGBR have been predicted, but research is lacking. The anti-hypertensive effects of PGBR were investigated in the downstream gene network of hypertension pathogenesis, including the renin-angiotensin system, fibrosis, oxidative stress production, and antioxidant enzymes in N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats. To strengthen our findings, the cardiac structure was also studied. PGBR-exposed rats showed significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to the hypertensive group. WR did not reduce SBP because of the loss of bioactive compounds during intensive milling. PGBR also reduced the expression of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX4), which contribute to the renin-angiotensin system, fibrosis, and oxidative stress production, respectively. Losartan (Los, an anti-hypertensive drug)-treated rats also exhibited similar gene expression, implying that PGBR may reduce hypertension using the same downstream target as Los. Our data also indicated that PGBR reduced cardiac lesions, such as the cardiomyopathy induced by L-NAME. This is the first report on the anti-hypertensive effects of PGBR in vivo by the suppression of the renin response, fibrosis, and improved cardiac structure."

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Adequate intake of whole grain foods is beneficial to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Whether the preventive effects are related with metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) is unclear. The study aims to evaluate the effects of germinated brown rice (GBR) intervention on BCAAs metabolism in T2DM patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized controlled trial, subjects with T2DM are instructed to consume 100 g day-1 GBR (GBR group, n=42) or equal staple food (Control group, n=25) for 3 months. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and serum samples are collected before and after the intervention. In the GBR group, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), and serum BCAAs are decreased, and islet function is improved (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that FBG (odds ratios [OR]: 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.84) and energy (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.30) are positively associated with serum total BCAAs level, while FINS is negatively associated (OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.04-0.88). Simultaneously, the key enzymes of BCAAs decomposition, which promotes glycolysis by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), are significantly increased. CONCLUSION: GBR improves the indicators of T2DM patients, and the underlying mechanisms include improving insulin resistance and accelerating catabolism of BCAAs.",

We profiled gut microbiota using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and evaluated cognitive function using the Corsi block-tapping test (CBT) and the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) before, during, and after the dietary intervention of 127 school-aged children in northern Thailand. While we found that Sinlek rice (SLR) consumption did not significantly alter the abundance of gut microbiota or the cognitive performance of school-aged children, we did find age to be associated with variations in both the gut microbiota profiles and cognitive outcomes. Gammaproteobacteria was significantly lower in the control and SLR groups during the middle time points of both phases (Weeks 4 and 61), and its abundance was associated with age. Cognitive performance using CBT and PVT were also found to be age-sensitive, as older children outperformed younger children on both of these cognitive assessments. Finally, a multiple factor analysis (MFA) revealed that age and cognitive performance best explain individual variation in this study. Collectively, these findings further describe the influence of host variables on the microbial profiles and cognitive outcomes of school-aged children consuming Sinlek rice in Thailand.",

The results showed that defatting combined with hydrothermal treatment could significantly improve the quality of brown rice, the hardness and chewiness of treated cooked brown rice decreased respectively from 20.385 N and 10.221 N to 14.494 N and 6.886 N, and the sensory score increased from 68.90 to 83.50. The room temperature water absorption rate of the treated brown rice increased from 10.72 % to 29.71 %, which was much higher than that of polished rice. The cooking quality of the treated brown rice was obviously improved, the optimal cooking time decreased from 30.33 min to 22.67 min, and the heating water absorption, volume expansion rate and solid loss increased from 147.32 %, 255.20 % and 13.35 mg/g to 219.15 %, 400.39 % and 22.49 mg/g, respectively. Scanning electron microscope showed that defatting combined with hydrothermal treatment significantly increased cracks and micropores of brown rice grains, which may be the intrinsic reason for the improvement in room temperature water absorption rate and cooking quality of brown rice and thus eating quality of cooked brown rice. The results are of great significance for promoting the staple consumption of whole-grain brown rice with broad application prospects.",

Multi-omics analysis revealed that the germination rate of brown rice was promoted by increased concentrations of low-molecular metabolites (carbohydrates and carbohydrate conjugates, fatty acids, amino acids, peptides, and analogues), and transcription factors (ARR-B, NAC, bHLH and AP2/EREBP families) as well as increased carbon metabolism.

Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the health-promoting properties of fermented rice bran extracts from cultivar black rice (H7F) and germinated brown rice (G13F), focusing on their prebiotic, antipathogenic bacteria activity and safety demonstrated in vitro and in vivo study models, respectively. Here, the screening of metabolites' change after rice bran fermentation by ATR-FTIR spectra revealed specific peaks corresponding to the composited components of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid. Then, in the in vitro study, the prebiotic capability of H7F and G13F extracts was demonstrated by a growth-promoting effect on Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis under specific acidic conditions. Furthermore, antipathogenic bacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was presented at 25 mg/mL of MIC values and 50 mg/mL of MBC of both fermented rice bran extracts, eliminating the bacteria by interfering with the biofilm formation. For safety, an acute and chronic toxicity study using Wistar rats was conducted, in which changes in the body and organ weights, histopathology of organs, blood chemistry, and hematological parameters were observed after H7F and G13F treatment. Desirably, they showed no toxicity, with a significant reduction in blood cholesterol levels in the chronic treatment of H7F and G13F. Conclusively, the overall results evidenced the health benefits of H7F and G13F related to their prebiotic and antipathogenic bacteria properties and hypocholesterolemia potential with a high level of safety. Therefore, the fermented rice bran extracts were demonstrated as potential materials for the further development of functional ingredients and health products."

      "abstract": "Rice has been a dietary staple for centuries, providing vital nutrients to the human body. Brown rice is well known for its nutrient-dense food profile. However, owing to multiple causes (anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic), it can also be a potential source of toxic heavy metals in the diet. Brown Hassawi rice samples were collected from the Al-Ahsa region and analyzed for its content of toxic metals. The results reveal that all the tested metals varied significantly in the brown rice samples, while As and Pb in all three samples exceeded their respective maximum allowable limits (MALs), followed by Cd, which nearly approached the MAL in two samples out of three. Brown rice samples were cooked in rice:water systems, viz., low rice:water ratios (1:2.5, 1:3.5) and high rice:water ratios (1:5, 1:6), along with soaking as a pre-treatment. Soaking was unproductive in removing the heavy metals from the rice, whereas cooking dissipated all metals from the rice, except for Cd, which was statistically non-significant. The high-water cooking of the rice was more effective in the dissipation of metals from the rice as compared to low-water cooking conditions. Through the consumption of rice, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of heavy metals is 162 g per person per day for As, which is above the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) regardless of cooking circumstances. The hazard risk index (HRI) also highlighted the fact that As can be a potential health hazard to rice consumers in the Al-Ahsa region of Saudi Arabia. These results indicate the potential health risks caused by the consumption of this rice by humans. Regular monitoring is recommended to manage and control elevated concentrations and related health hazards as a result of the use of Hassawi rice contaminated by the accumulation of metals and metalloids.",

      "abstract": "This study explored the influence of germination and fortification on the functionality and digestibility of brown rice from the perspective of starch structure changes. The surface of germinated brown rice starch appeared some pits and holes under the action of endogenous hydrolase, and the amylose content, relative crystallinity and short-range order of the starch decreased significantly after germination. However, the fortification treatment seemed to intensify the enzymatic hydrolysis of germinated brown rice starch, showing deeper pits, lower short-range order and less double helix structure. These changes in structural characteristics led to a significant decrease in peak viscosity, enthalpy change (ΔH) and starch hydrolysis rate after germination and fortification treatment. As the germination time increased, the trend became more obvious. And the peak viscosity and enthalpy change (ΔH) of fortified brown rice reached the minimum values of 290.89 cP and 13.73 J/g after 34 h of germination, respectively, while the starch hydrolysis rate reached the maximum value of 85.42 %. Overall, the combination of germination and fortification could be an effective method to adjust the functional and digestive characteristics of starch by changing its structural characteristics.",

We developed a low protein fermented genmai (brown rice) LPFG) to improve chronic kidney disease (CKD) management. The principal functional features of brown rice are retained in LPFG, lessening the negative spiral of gut-kidney associative spiral attributable to uremic dysbiosis and a leaky gut. LPFG is characterized by (1) an energy value the same as white rice, (2) a protein content less than 0.2 g/ 100 g, (3) a potassium content almost zero, (4) phosphorus less than a quarter that of conventional rice, (5) the presence of dietary fiber, (6) having γ-oryzanol, and (7) antioxidant activity. Dietary therapy for CKD patients is challenged by the joint needs to provide enough energy and to restrict protein. Patients replaced staple foods with LPFG without side dish restriction. Preliminary study of intervention with 3 months of LPFG reduced constipation probably by increased Blautia wexlerae, Bifidobacteria, acetic acid, and a decrease in potentially harmful bacteria. Protein intake decreased from 60 to 50 g per day. Urinary protein excretion decreased from 510 to 300 mg per day, and β2-microglobulin from 926 to 250 μg/L. Adherence to the LPFG diet enabled improvement in glomerular and tubular function.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the effect of high-pressure (HP), freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) and germination-parboiling (GP) treatments on lipid in vitro digestibility and rancidity of BR. GP treated BR released the most fatty acids (especially palmitic acid and stearic acid) after in vitro digestion, followed by FTC treated BR. FTC treated BR kept the highest value of fat acidity during storage, while opposite results were observed in GP treated BR. Although HP treatment increased fat acidity value immediately, it slowed down the increase of fat acidity with storage. The results of conjugated dienes and malonaldehydes content in BR stored under accelerated conditions indicated better lipid oxidation stability after HP and GP treatment, and that it's necessary for FTC treated BR products to be stored under anaerobic conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is an early pathophysiological feature and independent predictor of a poor prognosis in most forms of cardiovascular disease. We evaluated the effect of brown rice crackers (BR-C) on endothelial function. METHODS: Effect of heat-moisture treated (HMT) -BR-C on postprandial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in adults with mild endothelial dysfunction was compared with that of BR-C and white rice crackers (WR-C) in 12 adults with mild endothelial dysfunction (less than 7.0% of FMD) by a randomized, single-blind, three-treatment three-period crossover trial (UMIN 000034898). Since we considered that the FMD increase was associated with the treatment of HMT-BR-C, we examined the effect of three possible factors: postprandial glucose levels, polyphenol content, and polyphenol release from the food matrix. RESULTS: Mean pre-intake baseline FMD values of HMT-BR-C, BR-C, and WR-C were 4.9%, 5.1%, and 4.9%, respectively, and those values 1 h post-intake were 6.3%, 5.1%, and 4.8%, respectively. There was no difference in intergroup comparisons of FMD using Dunnett's multiple comparison test. There was a significant increase in FMD only in HMT-BR-C in intragroup comparisons (P = 0.042 by paired-t test). In comparison with BR-C, no significant difference was noted in the postprandial glucose level nor in the content of total polyphenols and ferulic acid derivatives in HMT-BR-C. However, the 70% ethanol extracted from HMT-BR-C contained a significantly larger amount of free and bound ferulic acids than from BR-C. CONCLUSION: HMT-BR-C intake increased the postprandial FMD response."

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) removal from paddy soil to reduce Cd accumulation in brown rice is essential for agroecology, food safety, and human health. In this study, we demonstrate that ferric chloride (FeCl3) washing combined with biochar treatment efficiently remediates Cd-contaminated paddy soil in field trials. Our results showed that 30.9 % of total Cd and 41.6 % of bioavailable Cd were removed by the addition of 0.03 M FeCl3 at a liquid/soil ratio of 1.5:1. The subsequent addition of 1 % biochar further reduced bioavailable Cd by 36.5 and 41.5 %, compared with FeCl3 washing or biochar treatment alone. The principal component regression analysis showed that the Cd content in brown rice was primarily affected by the bioavailable Cd in soil. The combined remediation contributed to the decreased Cd contents in brown rice by 45.5-62.5 %, as well as a 2.7-11.8 % increase in rice yield. The Cd contents in brown rice decreased to 0.12 and 0.04 mg kg-1 in two cultivars of rice (Zhuliangyou189 and Zhuliangyou929), lower than the national food safety standard limit value of China (0.2 mg kg-1). Meanwhile, the combined remediation promoted the restoration of soil pH and organic matter as well as the improvement of available nutrients. This finding suggests that the combination of FeCl3 washing and biochar is an effective remediation strategy to minimize Cd bioavailability in paddy soil, and improves soil quality, thus contributing to food safety.",

The zinc content in brown rice during germination time of 10-34 h gradually increased with the increase of zinc sulfate concentration (0-100 mg/L). Brown rice with zinc fortified concentration of 25 mg/L and germinated for 28 h was recommended, which reached the maximum (26.31%) of zinc bioavailability and met the requirements of recommended dietary intake (RDA) of zinc. The physicochemical and structural characteristics of brown rice under different treatment conditions were compared. As the germination time prolonged, the germination rate (%), total phenol content, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging rate (%) and Gamma-aminobutyric acid content of fortified or unfortified brown rice increased, while the phytic acid content decreased. The fortification treatment improved total phenol content and antioxidant activity of germinated brown rice. The crystalline structure of brown rice was destroyed during germination, but no significant change of crystalline structure caused by zinc sulfate fortification was found. These results could provide valuable reference for the application of germination in the field of brown rice fortification and the preparation of zinc-rich germinated brown rice products.",

However, the preventive effects of germinated brown rice (GBR), a new type of brown rice, on patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are rarely reported. Objectives: To investigate whether replacing 100 g refined white rice (RWR) with equal GBR per day is effective in T2DM and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: Ninety-nine qualified T2DM patients (64.58 ± 5.06 years old) were recruited. All patients were randomly divided into GBR group (100 g d-1 GBR for 12 weeks) and control group (keep the regular diet). Food frequency questionnaires, and fresh stool and serum samples were collected before and after the intervention, followed by various measurements. Results: Fasting blood glucose was obviously decreased after GBR intervention with an effective rate of 62%. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were decreased in the GBR group with no significance. In the GBR group, the abundance of beneficial bacteria in feces was increased, while harmful bacteria were decreased. The percentage of Bacteroides (57.2%) was largely increased. In addition, three types of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetic acid, propanoic acid, and butyric acid were increased significantly by GBR (p < 0.05). The secretion of GLP and PYY in serum, two kinds of gastrointestinal hormones downstream of SCFAs, was stimulated by GBR (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, GBR intervention could balance the ratio of Treg/Th17 immune cells in PBMCs and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors including IL-6, IL-8, and LPS in serum, which improved the permeability of intestinal mucosa. Conclusions: GBR (100 g d-1 for 12 weeks) has positive improvement in the fasting blood glucose for T2DM patients, which attributed to the recovery of intestinal homeostasis.",

WKY rats were divided into: Control group was fed normal drinking water and diet; FLD group was fed 10% high-fructose-water (HFW) and high-fat-diet (HFD); PGBR group was given HFW, and HFD mixed PGBR. After four weeks, the body, hepatic and cardiac weight gains of FLD group had significant increases than that of Control group. The enhanced blood pressure and heart rate, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, and higher liver function index (GPT levels) were observed; meanwhile, the IL-6 and TNF-α levels of serum, and TG level of liver were also elevated in FLD group. The related protein expressions of lipid synthesis, inflammation, cardiac fibrosis, and hypertrophy were deteriorated by HFW/HFD. However, in treatment group, PGBR decreased all above influenced parameters, additionally GOT; and related protein expressions. PGBR treated HFW/HFD-induced NAFLD and cardiac complications might be via improving lipid homeostasis, and inhibiting inflammation. Together, PGBR could be used as a healthy food for controlling NAFLD and its' cardiac dysfunction."

However, little is known about the influence of fermented brown rice beverage on the gut microbiota in humans. We therefore hypothesized that its impact would beneficially alter the gut microbiota composition of patients with MetS. Using a 4-week randomized, single-arm study design, subjects (n = 40) were advised to consume a daily fermented brown rice beverage (BA) or fermented white rice beverage (WA) as a replacement of their main meal. Clinical and anthropometric measurements as well as fecal samples were collected at baseline and immediately after completion of the intervention. Gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to measure plasma short-chain fatty acids. Interestingly, ingestion of BA in contrast to WA resulted in a unique elevation in the abundance of number of beneficial species belonging to the Clostridia class, associated with reduced inflammation, and increased short-chain fatty acid production: Lactobacillales bacterium DJF B280 (P = .005), Butyrate producing bacterium A2 207 (P = .012), and Firmicutes bacterium DJF VP44 (P = .038).

Both germination and GABA content were increased by exposure to PL, and this effect was evident when brown rice was exposed to PL immediately after being soaked. The PL group had significantly higher Glu and GABA content than the control check (CK) group which was unexposed to PL during the germination of brown rice. Glu content peaked at 18 h and GABA peaked at 24h in the PL group, which were 12 h and 6 h earlier than the CK group, respectively. GAD activity of the PL group peaked 12 h after germination, 6 h earlier than the CK group. PL exposure also increased the free amino acid content in the earliest stage of brown-rice germination. During brown-rice germination, the production of GABA is regulated by GAD activity and is significantly positively correlated with Glu content. PL treatment had a significant effect on GAD activity and Glu content during the germination process of brown rice and helped to increase its GABA content. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study has shown that pulsed light exposure is an efficient and stable processing method for producing brown rice with high GABA. This will provide a new direction for developing novel germination grain foods.",

Brown rice was exposed to SMF (10 mT, 60 min, 25 °C) and then germinated for 0 h -72 h at 30 °C. Compared with the control, SMF treatment improved α-amylase activity (15.2%), leading to the hydrolysis of starch into reducing sugar (8.2%) and increasing the germination rate (9.7% -158.8%), shoot length (9.1% -87.3%), root length (19.2% -110.0%), and fresh weight (0.9% -16.5%). In view of the properties of starch, SMF treatment also altered the surface microstructure, induced partial losses of birefringence, exerted no significant effect on the crystalline type, slightly increased the gelatinization temperatures, and significantly decreased the peak viscosity. This study suggested that SMF could serve as a prospective technique for GBR products processing.",

      "abstract": "In order to provide a theoretical basis on how germination treatment modulated the pasting behaviors of starches from native and germinated waxy brown rice, impacts of germination on the molecular and supramolecular structures and pasting behaviors were evaluated. Multiple analytical methods such as thermodynamics and spectroscopy were applied in this work for investigating the changes in starch multiscale structure and pasting behaviors. The results show that germination treatment contributed to an obvious increase in α- and β-amylase activities, which could degrade the starch chains and reduce the contents of double helices (50.9%-43.2%), short-range ordered degree (1.054-0.908), relative crystallinity (40.1%-30.5%), and lamellar ordering degree (dc, 6.09-5.46 nm) along with apparent erosion on starch granules. These structural amorphizations at the molecular and supramolecular levels could lead to the weakened entanglements and interactions among molecular chains, eventually reducing the characteristic viscosity (e.g., overall, peak, and final viscosity) of starch. This study may facilitate better development of germinated rice-based products.",

      "abstract": "Brown rice is nutritionally superior to polished white rice, as it maintains a large content of external bran that involves a series of bioactive compounds. However, the presence of bran also restricts water diffusion and results in adverse quality of brown rice. In this work, ultrasound conditions were optimized for cellulase to improve its hydrolysis effect on rice bran, and combinations of enzymatic and ultrasound treatment in different manners were conducted on brown rice, to improve the textural attributes. The results showed significant improvements in the catalytic activity and efficiency of cellulase after ultrasonication at the optimal intensity of 1.67 W cm-3 and duration of 30 min, with the conformational variation of cellulase observed from the fluorescence spectra and circular dichroism (CD). Despite the enhanced activity of ultrasonicated cellulase, it leaded to a similar rice surface morphology and a comparable amount of released glucose, and equivalent textural parameters of brown rice treated by native cellulase. However, for the pre-sonicated brown rice, the ultrasonicated cellulase showed a significantly higher hydrolysis capacity than the untreated enzyme, suggesting the important influence of ruptured bran surface on amplifying the hydrolysis effect of cellulase. Compared to the successive ultrasound stimulation on both cellulase and brown rice, ultrasound-assisted cellulase treatment on brown rice produced less glucose from rice bran, but induced similar textural properties of brown rice, possibly resulting from the simultaneously promoting effect of ultrasonication on cellulase and water diffusion. Ultimately, this study highlighted that the mild rice surface rupture is a crucial factor to display the promoted hydrolysis effect of ultrasonicated cellulase on brown rice. Ultrasound-assisted cellulase treatment potentially provides an effective strategy to improve the edible quality of brown rice.",

A total of 60 weanling pigs (28-day-old, 30 barrows and 30 gilts, 6.73 ± 0.77 kg body weight [BW]) were randomly allotted to 2 dietary treatments (6 pigs per pen; 5 replicates per treatment) in a randomized complete block design with the initial BW and sex as blocks. The dietary treatments were a typical nursery diet based on corn and soybean meal (CON) and the CON replaced 50% of corn with brown rice (BR). Pigs were fed respective dietary treatments for 5 weeks. For the last week of experiment period, pigs were fed respective dietary treatments containing 0.2% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Fecal samples were collected from randomly selected 1 pig in each pen daily for the last 3 d after the 4-d adjustment period. Blood was collected from randomly selected 1 pig in each pen on d 0, 3, 7, and 14 after weaning. Compared with pig fed CON diet, pigs fed the BR diet were found to have higher (p < 0.05) final BW, overall average daily gain, and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter and energy. However, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to average daily feed intake, gain to feed ratio, frequency of diarrhea, and the AID and ATTD of crude protein during overall experimental period. Similarly, there were no significant differences on blood parameters between the groups. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that brown rice (Japonica) can be used to replace 50% of corn in the diet of pigs during the nursery period without negatively affecting growth performance, nutrient digestibility, or blood parameters."

      "abstract": "In situ remediation technology applied aims to not only decrease cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) uptake by rice but also improve soil health and rice quality in contaminated paddy soils. Here the effects of a combined amendment, consisting of limestone, iron powder, silicon fertilizer, and calcium-magnesium-phosphate fertilizer, with three application rates (0, 450, and 900 g m-2) on soil health, rice root system, and brown rice quality were compared in moderately versus highly Cd and As co-contaminated paddy fields. After the amendment application, soil pH, cation exchange capacity, four kinds of soil enzyme activities increased (sucrase, urease, acid phosphatase, and catalase), and concentrations of leached Cd/As decreased, as measured by the DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) and TCLP (toxicity characteristic leaching procedure). Changes in the above soil indicators promoted soil health. In both fields, the dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB)-Fe and DCB-Mn concentration in iron plaque increased and root length became longer. Changes in the above root system indicators reduced the root system's absorption of Cd and As but increased that of nutrients. Under 900 g m-2 treatment, the Cd concentration in brown rice of two sites decreased by 55.8% and 28.9%, likewise inorganic As (iAs) decreased by 50.0% and 21.1%, whereas essential amino acids increased by 20.4% and 20.0%, respectively. Furthermore, the Cd and iAs concentrations in brown rice were <0.2 mg kg-1 (maximum contaminant level of Cd and iAs in the Chinese National Food Safety Standards GB2762-2017 for brown rice) under the 900 g m-2 in the moderately contaminated field. These results suggest the combined amendment can improve soil health and brown rice quality in the moderately and highly Cd- and As-co-contaminated paddy soils, offering potential eco-friendly and efficient remediation material for applications in such polluted paddy soils.",

The statistical assessment and pathway analysis of the metabolomics data demonstrated that in spite of significant metabolic changes in response to the germination treatment, the Japonica rice cultivars consistently expressed higher levels of several health-promoting compounds, such as essential amino acids and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), than the Indica cultivars. No clear discriminations of the volatile profiles were observed in light of the subspecies, and the concentrations of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including alkenes, aldehydes, furans, ketones, and alcohols, all exhibited significant reductions ranging from 26.8% to 64.1% after the germination. The results suggest that the Japonica cultivars might be desirable as the raw materials for generating and selecting GBR food products for health-conscious consumers."

Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is one of the DM management pillars to control blood glucose. Local Indonesian brown rice is proven to contain high fiber and magnesium levels thus could improve obesity, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c This study aims to prove the benefits of brown rice on anthropometric parameters and blood glucose control. DESIGN AND METHODS: Respondents were overweight women older than 40 years with type 2 diabetes who were given three main meals and three snacks six days a week for 12 weeks. Anthropometric and blood glucose control data were collected before and after the intervention. Diet and intake data before the intervention were obtained through a semi quantitate food frequency questionnaire. Intake data during the intervention were recorded using the 24-hour food record and analyzed using modified NutriSurvey 2007 software. RESULTS: Brown rice intervention significantly reduced body weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and abdominal circumference (p<0.05), also in fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (PBG), and HbA1c (p<0.05). From the Pearson's test results, an increase in fiber intake correlated with a decrease in BMI and abdominal circumference (p=0.03; r = -0.511 and p=0.006; r = -0.619, respectively). Meanwhile, magnesium intake and changes in BMI showed a negative correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The substitution of brown rice as a staple food for 12 weeks improves anthropometric parameters and blood glucose control in respondents with type 2 diabetes."

Seventy-two weanling pigs (28 d old with 6.78 ± 0.94 kg body weight [BW]) were randomly allotted to two dietary treatments with six pens and six pigs (three barrows and gilts) per pen within a randomized complete block design. The control pigs were fed a typical diet for weanling pigs based on corn and soybean meal diet (control diet: CON), and the other pigs were fed a formulated diet with 100% replacement of corn with ground brown rice for 35d (treatment diet: GBR). Growth performance, immune status, and gut microbiota of weanling pigs were measured. The substitution of corn with GBR did not affect growth performance or diarrhea frequency. Additionally, there were no differences in white blood cell number, hematocrit, cortisol, C-reactive protein, and serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels between pigs fed CON or GBR for the first 2 wk after weaning. However, weanling pigs fed GBR had lower (P < 0.05) serum transforming growth factor-beta 1 level than those fed CON. Furthermore, weanling pigs fed GBR had increased (P < 0.05) relative abundance of phylum Firmicutes and genus Lactobacillus and Streptococcus and decreased (P < 0.05) relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes and genus Clostridium and Prevotella in the gut microbiota compared with those fed CON. In conclusion, there was no significant difference in growth performance when corn was replaced with ground brown rice in diets for weanling pigs. Furthermore, the substitution of corn with ground brown rice in weaning diet modulated immune status and gut microbiota of pigs by increasing beneficial microbial communities and reducing harmful microbial communities. Overall, ground brown rice-based diet is a potential alternative to corn-based diet without negative effects on growth performance, immune status, and gut microbiota changes of weanling pigs.",

      "abstract": "We aimed to investigate how sulfur (S) application prior to oilseed rape cultivation influences the uptake of cadmium (Cd) by rice grown in low- and high-Cd soils. A pot experiment involving four S levels (0, 30, 60, 120 mg S kg-1) combined with two Cd rates (low and high-0.35 and 10.35 mg Cd kg-1, respectively) was conducted. Soil pore water during rice growth and plant tissues at maturity were analyzed. The soil pore water results indicated that S application decreased Cd solubility under submergence due to the S-induced increase of soil pH and the enhancement of sulfide formation in soil micropores. When S was applied at rates of 30, 60 and 120 mg S kg-1, brown rice Cd concentrations decreased by 18%, 18%, and 55% (p < 0.05) in the low-Cd soil but increased by 20%, 40%, and 40% in the high-Cd soil compared with those in the non-S treatment. The different effects of S on Cd accumulation in brown rice were related to Cd-induced oxidative stress in the rice plants. In low-Cd soils, a S-induced increase in phytochelatins in rice roots restricted and inhibited Cd translocation in brown rice. In high-Cd soils, the Cd-induced oxidative stress in rice plants weakened the protective effects of S, while highlighted the promotion of Cd uptake by S. Overall, S fertilizer is recommended for oilseed rape-rice rotations in low-Cd paddy fields. In high Cd-contaminated fields, oilseed rape-rice rotations are suitable for the simultaneous remediation by oilseed rape and production of rice without S fertilization.",

A pot experiment was conducted with four S levels (0, 30, 60, 120 mg S kg-1) and two Cd rates (low and high, 0.35 and 10.35 mg Cd kg-1) supplied to wheat. Part of the wheat straw was returned to the soil before planting rice, which was cultivated for 132 days. To explore the key mechanisms by which S application controlled Cd accumulation in brown rice, (1) soil pore water at the key growth stages was sampled, and dissolved Cd and S species concentrations were determined; (2) rice plant tissues (including iron plaque on the root surface) were sampled at maturity for Cd and S analysis. With increasing S level, Cd accumulation in brown rice peaked at 60 mg S kg-1, irrespective of soil Cd levels. For high-Cd soils, concentrations of Cd in brown rice increased by 57%, 228%, and 100% at 30, 60, and 120 mg S kg-1, respectively, compared with no S treatment. The increase in brown rice Cd by low S levels (0-60 mg kg-1) could be attributed to (1) the S-induced increase in soil pore water sulfate increasing the Cd influx into rice roots and (2) the S-induced increase in leaf S promoting Cd translocation into brown rice. However, brown rice Cd decreased at 120 mg S kg-1 due to (1) low Cd solubility at 120 mg S kg-1 and (2) root and leaf S uptake, which inhibited Cd uptake. Sulfur application to wheat crop increased the risk of Cd accumulation in brown rice. Thus, applying S-containing fertilizers to Cd-contaminated paddy soils is not recommended.",

A total of 100 growing pigs (23.80 ± 2.96 kg BW; 10 weeks of age) were randomly allotted to 4 dietary treatments (5 pigs/pen; 5 replicates/treatment) in a randomized complete block design (block = BW) as follows: corn-soybean meal basal diet (CON) and replacing corn with 50% (GBR50), 75% (GBR75), and 100% (GBR100) of ground brown rice. Each trial phase was for 6 weeks. During the growing period, there were no differences on growth performance and nutrient digestibility among dietary treatments. Similarly, no differences were found on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and carcass characteristics of pigs during the finishing period among dietary treatments. As a result of the beta diversity analysis, microbial populations were not clustered between CON and GBR100 during the growing phase, but clustered into two distinct groups of CON and GBR100 during the finishing phase. In conclusion, brown rice can be added to the diets of growing-finishing pigs by replacing corn up to 100% without negatively affecting growth performance of the pigs; additionally, this may have an effect on changes in pig intestinal microbiota if continued for a long time."

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) contamination, which poses a serious threat to human health, has been recognized as a major threat to the agricultural system and crop production. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in against Cd toxicity. Previously, we found that spraying rice with SA could reduce the Cd accumulation in rice grains grown in Cd-contaminated soil. In this study, we studied the specific mechanism of SA spray on reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain. The results showed that treatment with SA could alleviate Cd toxicity in rice by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation, but not by changing the pH, or total or available Cd of the soil. The key factor by which SA treatment reduced Cd accumulation in rice grains was by decreasing the Cd content in rice leaves at the flowering stage. This indicated that SA could modulate the Cd accumulation in shoots, reducing the Cd translocation to rice grains. Furthermore, SA could increase the H2O2 content, activating the SA-signaling pathway and modulating the expression levels of Cd transporters (OsLCT1 and OsLCD) in rice leaves to increase Cd tolerance and reduce Cd accumulation in the rice grain. Thus, spraying rice with SA may be effective measure to cope with Cd contamination in paddy soils.",

      "abstract": "Although brown rice (BR) contains significantly higher levels of nutrients than the traditionally used polished white rice (WR), its consumption among the population is still not noteworthy. WR and BR are essentially same grain. The only difference between the two is the application of an exhaustive milling procedure during the processing of WR that removes all other layers of the grain except the portion of its white endosperm. BR, on the other hand, is prepared by removing only the outer hull of the rice seed. Thus, in addition to its inner endosperm, the bran and germ are also left on the BR. Hence, BR retains all its nutrients, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, fibers, vitamins, minerals, tocopherols, tocotrienols, γ-oryzanol, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) packed into the bran and germ of the seed. Since BR tastes nutty and takes longer to cook than WR, it is not appreciated by the consumers. However, these problems have been circumvented using non-thermal ultra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHHP)-processing for the treatment of BR. A superior modification in the physicochemical and functional qualities of UHHPBR, along with its ability to curb human diseases may make it a more palatable and nutritious choice of rice over WR or the untreated-BR. Here, we have reviewed the mechanism by which UHHP treatment leads to the modification of nutrients such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and fibers. We have focused on the effects of rice on cell and animal models of different conditions such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension and the possible mechanisms. Finally, we have emphasized the effects of UHHPBR in human cases with rare conditions such as osteoporosis and brain cognition - two age-related degenerative diseases of the elderly population.",

The present study evaluated whether eating GBR could also improve glucose metabolism in subjects without diabetes. A prospective 6-week, single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study was carried out in subjects receiving annual medical checkup at our hospital. A total of 42 subjects were randomly assigned to continue their regular diet (RD group) or to switch GBR twice a day (GBR group). The primary outcome was the change in the serum concentration of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) from baseline after the 6-week dietary intervention. One subject was excluded from the analysis because of a traffic accident. After 6 weeks, the serum 1,5-AG was significantly increased in the GBR group and the mean treatment difference (GBR group - RD group) was 1.1 µg/mL (95% CI: 0.6 to 1.6, p=0.022). Body mass index decreased significantly in both groups, with no significant difference between them (p=0.210). There were no changes in fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, or eating behavior. Intake of GBR for 6 weeks significantly increased serum 1,5-AG in Japanese subjects without diabetes. The increase of 1,5-AG may have been due to the alleviation of postprandial hyperglycemia, which could be effective for the primary prevention of diabetes."

      "abstract": "Germinated brown rice (GBR) consists of bioactive compounds (BCs) that are very useful for diabetes treatment. Modified GBR-based flour (MGBRF) was produced by modifying the starch in GBR with 0, 299.19, 598.38, and 897.57 U/ml of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) for 1 hr and then spray-dried to examine its antidiabetic and cytotoxic effects. The results showed that the slowly digestible starch and resistant starch by modifying the starch in GBR with 598.38 U/ml of CGTase were 55.8% and 5.92% corresponding to the increase of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) and ferulic acid (FA) with 4.31 ± 0.68 mg/ml and 3.10 ± 0.02 mg/ml, respectively. The extract from MGBRF showed strong cytotoxic capacity against HepG2. Furthermore, the in vivo study revealed the stability of the glycemic index (GI) by consuming MGBRF with significant impacts on diabetes. These results suggest that MGBRF through the action of CGTase plays a major role in antidiabetes and HepG2 cell product value addition. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: GBR consists of BCs that are useful for diabetes and cancer treatment. However, when using this or GBR-based products, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of functional properties, especially for diabetes and/or cancer diseases due to high starch content. Therefore, the modification of starch to limit digestible starch, increase SDS and RS as well as to enhance the effect of BCs on diabetes and cytotoxic activity on cancer cell should be studied before producing various based products from GBR. The results in this study indicated that CGTase increased BCs without any glycosides BCs in the extract. The MGBRF changed to higher RS and SDS while increasing the BCs. The extract of MGBRF showed strong cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cell and a positive effect on type 2-diabetic mice. Hence, this study produces new information for effective use of GBR-based food as a functional food.",

This study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of germinated brown rice (GBR) on a rabbit model of chronic myocardial infarction. Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups receiving: 1) regular rabbit food; 2) regular rabbit food plus vehicle; and 3) regular rabbit food plus GBR for 120 d. The left circumflex coronary artery was ligated to induce myocardial ischemia 60 d after starting the experiment (baseline). Heart functions were monitored by electrocardiography and echocardiography at 0, 30, and 60 d after coronary artery ligation. The incidences of heart rate (HR) and ventricular arrhythmias have been compared between groups. GBR showed the effects to prevent life-threatening ventricular tachycardia and electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia in a model of arrhythmias. GBR consumption group exhibited significantly improved cardiac function and reduced the HR, along with reduced mean arterial pressure and plasma glucose level. The results demonstrated that GBR exerts cardioprotective effects against chronic myocardial injury in rabbits. These biological actions of GBR may explain the benefits gained from the use of GBR products as a possible prophylactic lifestyle intervention."

In Exp. 1, 72 Hy-line Brown layers (49-week-old) were allocated to two treatments using a completely randomized block design, and each treatment included six cages per treatment and six hens per cage. A semi-purified diet was formulated to include BR as the sole source of AA and energy and an N-free diet was used to determine basal endogenous loss of AA. The hens were fed a commercial layer diet for adaptation to the experimental environment and diet for 7 days from d 0, and then fed experimental diets for 5 days from d 7. Excreta were collected from d 10 to 11 and ileal digesta were collected on d 12. On a dry matter (DM) basis, the AME and AMEn of BR was determined at 3,773 and 3,729 kcal/kg, respectively. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of BR ranged from 32.7% for Thr to 73.7% for Arg. The range of the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) value was between 79.4% for Met and 96.6% for Lys. In Exp. 2, 252 Hy-line Brown layers (44-week-old) were divided into four groups, comprising seven replicates of nine birds each and assigned to four experimental diets containing 0 (Control), 5%, 10%, or 15% BR for 5 weeks. The BR-containing diets were formulated to be equal in the content of AMEn and digestible AA to those of the diet without BR. No significant differences were observed in laying performances. Egg quality and blood profiles were not linearly or quadratically affected by dietary treatments. These results suggest that up to 15% BR can be included into layer feed without any adverse effects on laying performance and egg quality, if its energy and digestible AA values are well evaluated."

Before baseline and after 3 months of the intervention, anthropometric measurements, blood chemical examinations, a nutrition survey, and physical activity measurements were conducted. The main finding showed that the percentages of patients with MetS in the PGBR group were reduced significantly compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Serum HDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly increased from 1.11 (mmol/l) to 1.44 (mmol/l) compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05).

Fermented grains are receiving increased attention due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Our previous study found that a combination of germinated brown rice (GBR) with probiotics suppressed colorectal carcinogenesis in rats. However, the cancer-preventive effect of probiotic-fermented GBR has not been reported. This study investigated the preventive effect and possible mechanism of GBR fermented by Lactobacillus acidophilus (FGBR) on colorectal carcinogenesis in rats induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). DMH/DSS treatment induced preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci (ACF), elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β, as well as decreased pro-apoptotic Bax expression. GBR and FGBR reduced the primary ACF number and decreased TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels. GBR and FGBR at the 2.5% level increased pro-apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 and decreased anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expressions. FGBR at the 2.5% level further reduced the number of sialomucin-producing ACF (SIM-ACF) and increased Bax expression. These results suggest that FGBR may inhibit preneoplastic lesions of the colon via activating the apoptotic pathway.

We observed that FRE of the Zhangzhou strain (FRE-Z) produced a high level of cordycepin and exhibited comprehensive in vitro antioxidant activity against the oxidation of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals and low-density lipoprotein. Only FRE-Z exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in MCF-7 (0.7 mg/mL) and MDA-MB-231 cells (1 mg/mL) after culturing for 24 h. The antiproliferative effects of FRE-Z were associated with an early stage of apoptosis induction at 4 h of treatment with 0.5 mg/mL FRE-Z in MCF-7 cells. The antiproliferative effect was determined to occur through p53 activation but not through the release of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor or caspase-9 activation for an initial culture period of 16 h. In addition to a transient increase in cellular antioxidant enzyme, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase was identified in MCF-7 cells after 2 h of treatment with FRE-Z. Therefore, FRE-Z, which exhibits various dose- and exposure time-dependent activities, has potential application in breast cancer chemoprevention.",

To support this with scientific evidence, cholesterol-lowering and antioxidative effects of GBR were studied in the present investigation. The most popular rice variety in Bangladesh BIRI-29 was used to prepare GBR and WR. Initially, we analyzed the proximate composition, antioxidative phytochemicals, in vitro 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-free radical scavenging ability and anti-hemolytic effects of GBR. To examine the dietary impact and possible benefits of the GBR, experimentally-induced hypercholesterolemic (HC, 1% cholesterol) rats were fed with GBR against WR for 12 wk. At the end, plasma total cholesterol (TC), low- and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C and HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), fecal TC, and hepatic TC, lipid peroxide (LPO) and proinflammatory TNFα levels were determined. Relative to WR, GBR contained higher amounts of total polyphenols, total flavonoids, β-carotene and lycopene, and exhibited a stronger in vitro DPPH-free radical scavenging ability and antihemolytic potentials. Levels of plasma TC, LDL-C, TG, and hepatic TC and TG significantly decreased, while plasma HDL-C and fecal TC levels significantly increased in the GBR-fed HC-rats, indicating dietary GBR demonstrates a stronger antilipidemic effect than WR. The hepatic levels of LPO and TNFα also decreased (p<0.05) to a greater extent in GBR-fed HC-rats than those in the WR-fed rats. It is thus concluded that dietary GBR could be a natural treatment of hypercholesterolemia and related cardiovascular risk factors, and a source of antioxidants to reduce hemolysis and related anemia.",

The development of functional foods that can prevent geriatric diseases is in progress. Our focus was on brown rice because of its properties. An interventional study using of ultra-high hydrostatic pressurized brown rice (UHHPBR) for human has not yet been conducted. In this study, we investigated whether long-term dietary intake of UHHPBR prevents aging-related decline of bone mineral density in elderly Japanese individuals. Elderly participants (n=40; mean 73.1 y) in Iinan-cho, Shimane, Japan, were randomly divided into two groups. The UHHPBR-intake group (n=20) consumed 100 g of UHHPBR and 100 g of white rice (WR) per day for 12 mo, while the WR-intake group (n=20) consumed 200 g of WR per day. Pre- and 12-mo post-intervention, bone mineral density was evaluated by quantitative ultrasound. After 12 mo of intervention, the UHHPBR group's bone mineral density was significantly higher than the WR group's bone mineral density. Moreover, chronic intake of UHHPBR had no adverse side effects on participants. Long-term oral UHHPBR intake may have beneficial effects on bone mineral density decline and may attenuate osteoporosis in the elderly.",

      "abstract": "As a staple food crop rice caters to the energy needs of more than 4 billion people around the globe. Since the 1980s, rice breeding focused on breeding for superior grain quality with good texture, taste, palatability and aroma. The recent rise in double burden nutrition challenges suggests that there is a pressing need to focus on incorporating nutritional traits also in rice breeding efforts. The present rice based diet contains nutritional gaps mainly due to the milling process which removes health promoting compounds present in rice bran. Therefore, less milled or brown rice consumption is highly recommended to achieve nutrition sustainability. Brown rice contains relatively higher amounts of dietary fibre, moderate amount of proteins, unsaturated lipids, micronutrients and several bioactive compounds. Some landraces consumed as brown rice have low glycemic index properties; hence they might be helpful to counter the growing type II diabetes. Colored rice varieties with red or purple pericarps are known to possess high levels of bioactive compounds such as cyanidin-3-glucoside, various flavanoids and γ-oryzanol. Germinated brown rice has more potential health benefits, for example, 10-fold of γ-aminobutyric acid than milled rice. For future nutritional intervention, we recommend further explorations into the nutritional value of brown rice as well as to modify the endosperm for enhanced nutrition without altering the texture to ensure consumer acceptance.",

      "abstract": "There have been no controlled systematic studies on the dynamic variation of As in soil - soil porewater - root surface (Fe plaques) - rice plant system under alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation. Therefore, effects of continuous flooding (CF) and AWD treatments (2F2D: 2-day flooding followed by 2-day drying; 7F2D: 7-day flooding followed by 2-day drying) on the migration of As from soil to brown rice were studied. Results indicated that As contents in brown rice of AWD treatments (0.03-0.17 mg/kg) were 43.3%-85.0% lower than CF (0.20-0.30 mg/kg). AWD irrigation promoted the transformation of Fe and associated As in rhizosphere soil from highly active forms (H2O and HCl-extracted Fe-bound As) to stable states (oxalate and DCB-extracted Fe-bound As), which decreased the release of As from rhizosphere soil. The dynamic variation of As contents in porewater was described by a dissolution factor (DF) which decreased significantly in AWD treatments and had a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.83; P < 0.05) with As contents in brown rice. In addition, contents of Fe and associated As on the root surface were about 17.1% and 11.0% higher in AWD treatments than in CF treatment, respectively, and the transfer factor (TF) of As from root surface into root was 22.7% lower in AWD treatments than in CF. In summary, AWD irrigation reduced As contents in porewater through decreasing availability of As in rhizosphere soil; and AWD also reduced the transfer of As into rice roots through promoting As sequestration by Fe plaques on root surface.",

      "abstract": "The therapeutic benefits of whole grains on diabetes mellitus have been continuously confirmed by in-depth research. To date, limited studies have investigated the effect of extruded products of whole grains on the insulin signaling pathway in vivo. This study investigated the effects of oral consumption of whole grain extrudate, including 97% brown rice and 3% defatted rice bran (w/w, BRD), on glucose metabolism and the hepatic insulin signaling pathway in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. BRD treatment induced a remarkable reduction in blood glucose. Moreover, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were ameliorated in the BRD-treated group compared with those in the db/db control group. BRD also increased the hepatic glycogen content by reducing the expression and increasing the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). The activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and their respective mRNA expression levels in the liver were simultaneously decreased in the BRD-treated group. BRD also significantly upregulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and increased the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase B (AKT). These results indicate that BRD exhibits antidiabetic potential by activating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, further regulating the expression of the FOXO1 gene and p-GSK3β protein, thus inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, increasing hepatic glycogen storage, and improving insulin resistance. Therefore, BRD could be used as a functional ingredient to alleviate the symptoms of hyperglycemia.",

      "abstract": "Breeding the rice cultivar with high cadmium (Cd) accumulation in straw but with low Cd in brown rice using marker-assisted selection (MAS) based on quantitative trait loci (QTL) is meaningful for phytoremediation as well as safety in production. A restorer rice line, YaHui2816, steadily showed low Cd translocation from straw to brown rice and carried alleles for reducing Cd concentration in brown rice (BRCdC). In this study, one F2 population (C268A/YaHui2816) was used to identify the QTLs for BRCdC in 2016, and other two different F2 populations (Lu98A/YaHui2816 and 5406A/YaHui2816) were used to furtherly validate the QTLs in 2017. Furthermore, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the relative expression of predicted genes in the regions of these QTLs for BRCdC. Here 4 QTLs for BRCdC were identified, among which, 2 novel QTLs (qBRCdC-9 and qBRCdC-12) were identified on chromosomes 9 and 12 in rice. The YaHui2816 alleles in the QTLs qBRCdC-9 and qBRCdC-12 could effectively reduce BRCdC under different genetic backgrounds. Importantly, the QTL qBRCdC-12 was simultaneously associated with the Cd translocation from shoot to brown rice (T-s-b), genetically explaining that the low T-s-b of the YaHui2816 resulted in its low BRCdC. The interval length of the QTL qBRCdC-12 was only narrowed to 0.28 cM, making it possible to develop molecular markers and excavate genes for reducing BRCdC. It is worth noting that genes existed in these QTL regions have not been reported for regulating the Cd translocation in rice. 6 candidate genes (OS05G0198400, OS05G0178300, OS09G0544400, OS12G0161100, OS12G0162100 and OS12G0165200) up-regulated expressed in nodeⅡof the YaHui2816 in response to Cd treatment, and encoded ZRT/IRT-like protein (ZIP) 4, the protein similar to glutathione transferase (GSTs) 16, heat shock protein Hsp20 domain containing protein, MAP kinase-like protein and Cd tolerant protein 5, respectively.",

The selection of spectral data was accomplished by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), an algorithm currently used in machine learning, but rarely applied in chemical issues. Emission lines of C, Ca, Fe, Mg and Na were selected, and the best performance of classification were obtained using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. The developed method provided 84% of accuracy, 100% of sensitivity and 78% of specificity in classification of test samples. Furthermore, it is simple, clean and can be easily applied for rice certification.",

The treatment conditions had no significant influence on the cooking or taste qualities of GBR. Correlation analysis showed the taste value of cooked GBR significantly correlated with hardness, springiness, chewiness, and stickiness. The cyclic cellulase conditioning treatment could contribute to improved cooking and taste qualities of GBR and higher GABA content of GBR compared to the soaking treatment. The cooking and taste qualities of GBR were improved by the degradation of the crude fibre of the cortex and the increase in GBR water absorption rate under cyclic cellulase conditioning.",

One day after treatment, and every 3 months for 12 months, treated rice was mixed with untreated brown rice in the following ratios: 0:100 (untreated controls), 10:90, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, and 100:0 (all treated). Bioassays were conducted by exposing 10 parental adults of each species on the rice mixtures and assessing progeny production, feeding damage, and weight loss. The progeny of S. cerealella ranged from 105.6 F₁ adults on untreated brown rice to 69.4 F₁ adults on 100% treated rice, but there was little feeding damage or weight loss. The progeny production of R. dominica declined from 177.4 F₁ adults on untreated rice to 9.8 F₁ adults on 100% treated rice. Weight loss and feeding damage were correlated with progeny production. The results show that the new deltamethrin formulation could be used for protection of brown rice, but S. cerealella may be less susceptible to deltamethrin compared to R. dominica."

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a common cancer strongly associated with diet. Certain probiotics and prebiotics possess an inhibitory activity against colorectal cancer, while synbiotics may be more effective in preventing this cancer than either prebiotics or probiotics alone. Germinated brown rice (GBR) is considered as a candidate prebiotics with anticancer potential. However, the effect of GBR combined with probiotics on colorectal cancer is not clear. The present study investigated the preventive effect of combination of GBR and Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, or both on colorectal carcinogenesis and the possible mechanism in rats treated with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). DMH/DSS treatment induced preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and mucin-depleted foci (MDF), reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, increased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression, and decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, and caspase-3 in the colon. Germinated brown rice alone or combined with probiotics inhibited the formation of MDF in the middle colon, enhanced the colonic expression of p53 and Bax, and increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Combined treatment of GBR and probiotics inhibited the formation of ACF-producing sialomucin (SIM-ACF) and recovered the activity of SOD in the colon. Combination of GBR and L. acidophilus further increased caspase-3 expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression. These findings suggest that GBR combined with L. acidophilus and/or B. animalis subsp. lactis may inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis by enhancing antioxidative capacity and inducing apoptosis. This synbiotics may be a potential functional food or chemopreventive agent for controlling colorectal cancer."

Germination could deteriorate the fluidity and solubility of brown rice powder and reduce the digestibility of protein, and starch. Exogenous enzyme treatment improved the fluidity and solubility of the brown rice powder as well as the digestion rate of protein and starch. The synergistic treatment of germination and exogenous enzymes significantly increased the digestibility of starch, but it deteriorated the fluidity, the rate of agglomeration and dispersion time. Comparing with DGBRE, DBRE produced a better quality instant brown rice powder.",

      "abstract": "Effect of heat-moisture treatment (HMT) of brown rice flour on the quality and digestibility of Korean rice cake (jeolpyeon) was investigated. Brown rice flour with 20% moisture content was heat-moisture treated at 100-110 °C for 1-2 h, and subsequently cooled to 4 °C for 1-2 h. The lightness of HMT rice cake decreased as HMT temperature and time increased, whereas redness and yellowness increased. The hardness, springiness, and cohesiveness of HMT rice cake were much lower than those of brown rice cake. HMT of rice cake caused an increase in the resistant starch content and a decrease in the rapidly digestible starch content. In sensory evaluation, hardness of HMT rice cake was substantially lower than that of rice cake made with untreated brown rice due to retardation of retrogradation. However, the overall acceptability of HMT rice cake was lower than that of white rice cake or brown rice cake."

      "abstract": "The phenolics were extracted and purified from brown rice and twenty-seven compounds were identified, including six phenolic acids, four phenolic acid glycosides, and eight flavonoid glycosides. Afterwards, the hydrothermal stability of phenolic extracts of brown rice was investigated after treatment at 60, 80, or 100 °C for 120 min. After hydrothermal treatment, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and free glucose were increased, while the phenolic glycosides were decreased. In addition, the total phenolic and total flavonoid content were decreased by 5.7%-9.2% and 3.5%-5.8% after initial 30 min, and then they were slightly recovered after treatment for 120 min. Consequently, there was a slight reduction (<10%) in the total antioxidant activity of the phenolic extracts after hydrothermal treatment. These results suggest that hydrothermal treatment of phenolic extracts of brown rice made some phenolic glycosides deglycosylated, but does not lead to a large reduction in their overall antioxidant activity.",

      "abstract": "Rice is a staple food for about 65% of the India's population. India ranks first in area under rice and second in production of rice in the world. In India, it is cultivated over 43.39 m ha with a production and productivity of 104.32 million tons and 2404 kg/ha, respectively. Besides ensuring food security of the nation, it is an export commodity and earns a huge foreign exchange. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of five fungicides against Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn AG-1 IA, inciting sheath blight of rice in vitro and under field conditions along with post-harvest residue of the fungicides found effective in disease management. In vitro growth inhibition tests revealed that the EC50 values of azoxystrobin 18.2% + difenoconazole 11.4% SC, pencycuron 22.9% SC, thifluzamide 23.9% SC, hexaconazole 4% + zineb 68% WP, and validamycin 3% L against Rhizoctonia solani ranged from 0.006 to 354.81 ppm a.i., whereas the corresponding EC90 values were 0.758 to 1202.26 ppm a.i. Thifluzamide 23.9% SC was found to be the most inhibitory with EC50 and EC90 values of 0.006 and 0.758 ppm a.i. followed by hexaconazole 4% + zineb 68% WP. The complete inhibition of sclerotia formation was observed at 1 ppm, 20 ppm, and 25 ppm a.i. of thifluzamide 23.9% SC, hexaconazole 4% + zineb 68% WP, and azoxystrobin 18.2% + difenoconazole 11.4% SC, respectively. In field trials, azoxystrobin 18.2% + difenoconazole 11.4% SC was the best treatment in reducing sheath blight and in enhancing grain yield of rice followed by thifluzamide 23.9% SC, pencycuron 22.9% SC, and validamycin 3% L, whereas hexaconazole 4% + zineb 68% WP was the least effective fungicide. Benefit-cost ratio (B:C) of different fungicides reflected that pencycuron 22.9% SC (B:C 5.06) and azoxystrobin 18.2% + difenoconazole 11.4% SC(B:C 4.65) sprayed at single/recommended doses of 1 ml/l were highly economical in managing sheath blight disease of rice. Double dose of pencycuron 22.9% SC further enhanced the B:C to 7.24 while the double dose of azoxystrobin 18.2% + difenoconazole 11.4% SC was less economical (B:C 2.84) compared to their recommended doses. Samples of rice matrices were processed using QuEChERS method and analyzed for the presence of fungicide residues by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The post-harvest residues of azoxystrobin, difenoconazole, and pencycuron, sprayed at single/recommended and double doses with a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of 44 days, were found below the limit of quantification (LOQ), i.e., 0.01 and 0.005 mg kg-1 for azoxystrobin and difenoconazole and 0.05 mg kg-1 for pencycuron in brown rice, cropped soil, paddy straw, and husk. These results clearly demonstrated that treatment of azoxystrobin 18.2% + difenoconazole 11.4% SC and pencycuron 22.9% SC could be taken as safe for crop protection and environmental contamination point of view. The findings of this research work will have a positive impact on rice export and use.",

The results demonstrated that these animals showed significant reduction in all parameters of sperm quality, an increase in abnormal testicular structure and decreased androgen receptor expression in spermatogenic, Sertoli and Leydig cells. However, different effects of the treatments applied in this study were observed with the greatest recovery effect from treatment with PGBR. Sperm motility and sperm concentration reverted to normal after treatment with PGBR for 60 days. Moreover, all parameters of testicular structure also returned to normal after 60 days of PGBR treatment, as well as AR expression in Sertoli and Leydig cells. Therefore, we have demonstrated that PGBR treatment can reverse the changes in sperm quality, testicular structure and AR expression in addicted animals and PGBR may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of drug addiction.",

Components of the germ layer and bran of Brown rice (BR) help maintain good health and prevent AD. Because the germ layer and bran absorb little water and are very hard and difficult to cook, they are often removed during processing. To solve these problems, in this study, we tried to use a high-pressure (HP) technique. METHODS: We produced the highly water pressurized brown rice (HPBR) by pressurizing BR at 600 MPa, and then we fed it to an AD mouse model, senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8, to investigate the therapeutic effects of HPBR on cognitive dysfunction by Y-maze spatial memory test. RESULTS: HP treatment increased the water absorbency of BR without nutrient loss. HPBR ameliorated cognitive dysfunction and reduced the levels of amyloid-β, which is a major protein responsible for AD, in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HPBR is effective for preventing AD.",

Five different HMTs using brown rice (moisture content was 12.0%) were assessed: 0.1 MPa/120 °C for 5 or 10 min, 0.2 MPa/134 °C for 5 or 10 min and 0.3 MPa/144 °C for 10 min. HMT, decreased the α-amylase and lipase activities, and fat acidity, and slightly increased the dietary fiber and resistant starch levels. After 2 months' storage at 35 °C, rice samples that were treated with 0.2 MPa/134 °C or 0.3 MPa/144 °C for 10 min had a lower fat acidity than untreated samples, which would be useful for long-term storage and export of rice flour. And HMT exhibited inhibition of retrogradation in the pasting and physical properties, which is profitable to promote the qualities of the rice products.",

      "abstract": "Colon cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and it has recently become a leading cause of death worldwide. Among colon cancers, the v-ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutated form is notorious for its non-druggable features. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor, has been introduced as an antitumor therapy; however, secondary resistance and side effects significantly limit its effective use in these cancers. In this study, we prepared Phellinuslinteus on germinated brown rice (PBR) extracts to increase the sensitivity of KRAS-mutated colon cancers to cetuximab. The combined treatment of PBR extract and cetuximab suppressed SW480 cell viability/proliferation, with the cells exhibiting altered cellular morphology and clonogenic potential. AnnexinV-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide-stained flow cytometry and Western blotting were performed, and PBR extract combined with cetuximab treatment increased apoptosis of the SW480 cells and suppressed their KRAS protein expression. The potential of PBR as a synergistic anticancer agent was further investigated in a tumor-xenografted mouse model. Tumor growth was significantly suppressed with PBR extract and cetuximab co-treatment. In conclusion, PBR increased the sensitivity of KRAS-mutated colon cancer cells to cetuximab, which indicates the potential use of PBR as a medical food against colon cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whole-grain products such as brown rice have been associated with lower risk of metabolic disorders including diabetes. We examined the acceptability and tolerability of substituting brown rice for white rice and the feasibility of introducing brown rice into the diet through a long-term trial to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Fifty-one adults residing in Abuja, Nigeria, participated in this study. Using purposeful sampling for focus group discussions (FGDs), participants were enrolled based on their age (19-25 vs. 40-60 years) and body mass index (BMI) (normal weight vs. overweight/obese). Participants tasted four meals with different constitution of brown and white rice (25:75%, 50:50%, 75:25%, and 100% brown rice). Twelve FGDs were conducted, six before and six after the food tasting. Two-hour postprandial blood glucose was measured after consumption of each rice meal. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 39 (±14) years, their mean BMI was 25.6 (±5.2) and about half of them were male. Most of the participants (61%) reported that rice was their main source of carbohydrate and 67% consumed rice at least five times/week. Before the food tasting, participants considered white polished rice superior to brown rice with regard to quality, taste, and nutritional value. After the food tasting, most of the participants (49%) indicated a preference for the 100% brown rice, 19% preferred the 25% brown rice, 18% preferred the 50% brown rice, and 7% preferred the 75% brown rice meals. Factors that may affect the acceptability of brown rice include its appearance, longer cooking time, cost, limited availability, and poor appreciation of its nutritional value. In general, 2-h postprandial glucose levels were lower, after consumption of meals with higher proportion of brown rice. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insight into the acceptability of brown rice as a substitute for white rice in Nigeria. If confirmed in larger studies, these results highlight the importance of increasing awareness on the nutritional value of brown rice and support the rationale for conducting a large-scale intervention trial to examine the effect of brown rice consumption on blood sugar levels among Nigerians."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: A fiber-rich diet has a cardioprotective effect, but the mechanism for this remains unclear. We hypothesized that a fiber-rich diet with brown rice improves endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at a single general hospital in Japan were randomly assigned to a brown rice (n = 14) or white rice (n = 14) diet and were followed for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in endothelial function determined from flow debt repayment by reactive hyperemia using strain-gauge plethysmography in the fasting state. Secondary outcomes were changes in HbA1c, postprandial glucose excursions, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. The area under the curve for glucose after ingesting 250 kcal of assigned rice was compared between baseline (T0) and at the end of the intervention (T1) to estimate glucose excursions in each group. RESULTS: Improvement in endothelial function, assessed by fasting flow debt repayment (20.4% vs. -5.8%, p = 0.004), was significantly greater in the brown rice diet group than the white rice diet group, although the between-group difference in change of fiber intake was small (5.6 g/day vs. -1.2 g/day, p<0.0001). Changes in total, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol, and urine 8-isoprostane levels did not differ between the two groups. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level tended to improve in the brown rice diet group compared with the white rice diet group (0.01 μg/L vs. -0.04 μg/L, p = 0.063). The area under the curve for glucose was subtly but consistently lower in the brown rice diet group (T0: 21.4 mmol/L*h vs. 24.0 mmol/L*h, p = 0.043, T1: 20.4 mmol/L*h vs. 23.3 mmol/L*h, p = 0.046) without changes in HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention with a fiber-rich diet with brown rice effectively improved endothelial function, without changes in HbA1c levels, possibly through reducing glucose excursions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: A decrease in gastrointestinal motility causing weakened lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - toll-like receptor (TLR)4 signaling along with a decline in the number of enteric bacteria is known to be a cause of constipation due to the administration of antibiotics. A new type of brown rice with its wax layer removed, resulting in quick-cooking and tasty product, contains 100-times more LPS than polished white rice. In this study, the improvement effect on constipation due to intake of dewaxed brown rice was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dewaxed brown rice was prepared at Toyo Rice from brown rice. Mice were given powdered feed to which powdered rice containing 0-50% of dewaxed brown rice was added. Antibiotics were administered for 10 or 27 days in drinking water containing vancomycin, metronidazole and neomycin. LPS, used as a control, was freely provided in drinking water. The defecation frequency, stool weight per hour and body weight were determined on the last day. RESULTS: Although the 10-day administration of antibiotics reduced the stool weight per hour to half, the dewaxed brown rice and LPS groups showed a trend towards improvement at a level comparable to the group receiving no antibiotics. The body weight significantly decreased after the 27-day administration of antibiotics but was improved in the 50% dewaxed brown rice group at a level comparable to the group receiving no antibiotics. Though the defecation frequency and wet and dry stool weights per hour were reduced by as much as 50% in the group receiving antibiotics, a significant improvement in constipation was observed in the 50% dewaxed brown rice group. CONCLUSION: As the improvement effect of dewaxed brown rice on body weight loss and constipation caused by the long-term administration of antibiotics has been confirmed in animal experimentation, the introduction of dewaxed brown rice as a staple food to patients under long-term antibiotic treatment may improve constipation.",

Water absorption ratio and lightness values of brown rice were increased by soaking and HPT. Hardness and gumminess values of cooked brown rice were reduced while springiness and cohesiveness were elevated by HPT. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that HPT improved the texture of brown rice by disrupting the structure of rice bran layer, which allowed easier water penetration into the rice grain during cooking. Moreover, the two cycle HPT resulted in lighter color and softer texture for cooked brown rice than single cycle HPT primarily caused by the more severe structural disruption of bran layer. Overall, two cycle HPT after soaking could potentially improve the quality of brown rice, taking about the same time as the single cycle HPT. Further, the quality improvements with the two cycle HPT were facilitated at lower pressure levels thereby providing better commercial processing opportunities."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We recently reported that eating glutinous brown rice (GBR) for 1 day improved the whole-day glucose profile and postprandial plasma glucose level compared with eating white rice (WR) or standard brown rice. However, it was unknown whether eating GBR could maintain improvement of glycemic control for a longer period. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of GBR intake for 8 weeks on glycemic control in outpatients with diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This was an open-label randomized crossover study in outpatients with type 2 diabetes. Among the 18 subjects registered in this study, 2 were excluded from analysis. After a 1-week observation period while eating WR twice a day, the patients were randomly assigned to two groups. One group ate GBR as a staple food twice a day for 8 weeks and then switched to WR for the next 8 weeks, while the other group ate WR first and then switched to GBR. A mixed meal tolerance test was performed at baseline and after 8 and 16 weeks of dietary intervention to evaluate plasma glucose and serum C-peptide. RESULTS: None of the subjects failed to complete the study because of disliking the taste of GBR. Hemoglobin A1c (7.5-7.2%, P=0.014) and glycoalbumin (20.4-19.4%, P=0.029) both decreased significantly when the patients were eating GBR. Additionally, the 30-min postprandial plasma glucose level (194-172 mg dl-1, P=0.031) and the incremental area under the concentration vs time curve of serum C-peptide (31.3-22.1 ng min ml-1, P=0.023) during the mixed meal tolerance test were also decreased significantly by intake of GBR. In contrast, there were no changes of glycemic control during the WR period. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that GBR was well tolerated for 8 weeks and improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

KDML 105 with 8.06% moisture content, the effects of three packaging conditions on the characteristics of GPBR were investigated. GPBR in laminated (nylon/LLDPE) bags was sealed as follows: vacuum-sealed, 40% N2-sealed with 60% CO2 (60% CO2+40% N2), or 100% N2-sealed before storage under ambient conditions (30±2°C, 70±5% RH) for 15 months. GPBR in all the packages exhibited delayed fungal proliferation and very low aflatoxin B1 contamination (<0.82 μg/kg). The 100% N2-sealed package was the best treatment to preserve GPBR quality, as indicated by the highest 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and free fatty acid content as well as the least rancidity and brownness. As observed through a scanning electron microscope, compared with vacuum-sealed packages and those sealed with 60% CO2+40% N2, the lowest hardness texture and the least elongation of cooked rice in 100% N2-sealed package were linked to a lesser compact GPBR endosperm ultrastructure."

This study investigated the effects of microwave irradiation (MWI) (2450 MHz, 700 W, 10-50 s) on inactivation of A. flavus and A. parasiticus on brown rice and barley and the quality of these samples. The counts of both strains were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by the stepwise increase in MWI treatment time. The log reductions of A. flavus on brown rice and barley were 0.05 and 0.04 after 10 s; 1.06 and 1.05 after 20 s; 1.59 and 1.52 after 30 s; and 3.04 and 2.78 after 40 s. The log reductions of A. parasiticus on brown rice and barley were 0.06 and 0.10 after 10 s; 1.20 and 1.00 after 20 s; 2.04 and 1.61 after 30 s; and 2.89 and 2.90 after 40 s. Moreover, neither strain survived after 50 s of MWI. The Hunter colour 'L' gradually increased with increasing MWI treatment time. However, there were no significant differences in the 'L' of brown rice after 10-40 s of MWI treatment and of barley after 10-30 s of MWI treatment. The Hunter colour 'a' and 'b' gradually increased with increasing microwave time. No significant change was observed in the moisture content of either cereal treated with 10-20 s of MWI. The differences in the sensory quality (colour, appearance, flavour, texture and overall acceptability) after 0-30 s of MWI were not significant. However, values for colour, appearance, texture and overall acceptability were significantly reduced when treated with 40-50 s of MWI. Therefore, with 20 s of MWI at 2450 MHz, 700 W could be effective for > 90% reduction of mould without causing deleterious changes to the colour, moisture content and sensory qualities of these cereals.",
