      "abstract": "Modifying the diet is an effective strategy to enhance the production and health of farmed red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). In this study the effects of adding dietary oregano essential oil (OEO) at 0, 100, 300, and 500 mg/kg concentrations were investigated in red swamp crayfish after a 3-week feeding trial. Histology showed no negative impacts on the structural integrity of the hepatopancreas and intestine. Total protease activity in the hepatopancreas, hemolymph alkaline and acid phosphatase activity, hemolymph superoxide dismutase activity and hepatopancreas glutathione levels were higher in the 500 mg/kg OEO group than in the 0 mg/kg group. No significant differences were observed in hepatopancreas phenoloxidase activity or hemolymph malondialdehyde content between treatment groups. Supplementing the diet with OEO upregulated the expression of antioxidant and immune-related genes in the hepatopancreas including metallothionein, gamma interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase, and catalase in the 500 mg/kg OEO group relative to the 0 mg/kg control. Ferritin gene expression was unaltered. The intestinal microbiota of crayfish fed OEO showed an increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota, and a lower abundance of Firmicutes. This study demonstrates the potential of OEO as a novel feed additive for enhancing antioxidant capacity and the immune response in red swamp crayfish. This research addresses the growing need for sustainable aquaculture practices and highlights the application of plant-derived bioactivities in improving crustacean health."

      "abstract": "Spotty liver disease (SLD) caused by Campylobacter hepaticus has emerged as an important cause of disease in table egg layers in the United States. The disease associated with C. hepaticus results in focal lesions on the livers of infected birds, reduced egg production, and increased mortality of layer hens. Currently, there are no approved treatments and no commercial vaccine available for C. hepaticus, and very limited research is available supporting best approaches for the control of C. hepaticus in organic or antibiotic free-laying hens. We assessed the potential effects of water acidification treatments for the control of C. hepaticus in challenged specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and transmission of the organism to naïve birds. The objective of this study was to develop a challenge and treatment model to assess the effects of oregano, apple cider vinegar, and citric acid as potential control measures for C. hepaticus in challenged birds. We divided 148 SPF chickens, 17 wk of age, into five groups; four groups (with 51% of the birds in each group orally challenged with C. hepaticus) and one negative control group (n = 8). A dose of 107 cfu/ml of C. hepaticus was given on day 1, day 4, and day 7 by oral gavage. At day 10 after the day 1 challenge, three challenged groups were treated for 5 days with either oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid in the water. One challenged but not treated group and the negative control received only water as treatment. Bile and liver samples from challenged and nonchallenged naïve exposed birds were collected from euthanatized birds at days 9, 15, 20, and 27 after the first day challenge to evaluate the presence of C. hepaticus gross lesions and detection via culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation. Results showed that challenged birds were able to develop mild to moderate multifocal liver lesions resembling SLD. Severe lesions were evident in the naïve, exposed nonchallenged birds. Positive bacterial culture and colony PCR positives were found in challenged birds in each challenge group. Results from PCR of DNA extracted from liver samples were able to detect a greater number of C. hepaticus-positive samples than culture PCR of bile alone. Treatment with oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid was not able to clear C. hepaticus from challenged birds because more than 44% of the challenged birds remained positive on liver PCR analysis posttreatment. Results also found that C. hepaticus could be passed horizontally because more than 29% of the naïve nonchallenged birds became C. hepaticus positive postintroduction to challenged birds. Overall, this study found that this challenge model for C. hepaticus was successful and that treatments did not clear C. hepaticus in challenged birds. Nevertheless, it appears that acidifying the water could help to reduce C. hepaticus load in naïve birds because in groups treated with oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid C. hepaticus could not be cultured from bile.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prolonged exposure to cold stress in cattle increases basal energy consumption and impedes optimal production. Consequently, herds require adequate attention during cold, extended winters to alleviate cold stress and maintain profitability. This study investigated the effects of oregano essential oil (EO) on body weight (BW), well-being, blood parameters, and cecal microbiota. Eighteen steers were randomly divided into two groups (n = 9) and fed either a basal diet (CK) or the same diet supplemented with 20 g/(d·head) EO for 270 days. RESULTS: EO increased BW by increasing cecal microbial abundance and carbohydrate metabolism CAZymes, leading to elevated the total volatile fatty acids (VFA) levels. Cold stress activated the HPA axis, and mitigated stress by reducing serum levels of cortisol (COR), corticosterone (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and dopamine (DA). EO increased well-being by decreasing viral species without apparent contribution to drug or antibiotic resistance development, and cecal metabolites were primarily enriched in growth, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism pathways. Specifically, tryptophan metabolism (2-picolinic acid, quinolinic acid, and oxindole) enhanced steer well-being by increasing antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidases (POD), and glutathione (GSH)) and reducing inflammatory factors (interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) following EO treatment. Notably, low-abundance microorganisms (s_Streptomyces_gardneri, s_Paenibacillus_sp._S09, and s_Nocardia_sp._Root136) may play a significant role in growth and immunity. CONCLUSION: These findings provide fundamental insights into how EO alleviates cold stress by modulating the HPA axis, promotes growth and well-being of steers under cold stress by influencing mediates tryptophan metabolism of cecal microbiota in Holstein steers."

The present work aimed to study the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effectiveness of a combined preparation based on viper venom and essential oil. Determining effective routes of exposure, optimal doses, the duration of action of the preparation, and possible mechanisms of their action were the areas of interest. METHODS: Experiments were carried out on murine. Essential oil content was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment. The formalin, carrageenan, and hot plate tests were used. Certain methods for determining side effects were used as well. To determine the participation of cannabinoid and opioid receptors in the antinociceptive action of combined preparation, SR144528 and naloxone were used. RESULTS: The treatment of the ointment version of the preparation reduced inflammatory pain by more than 68% and decreased the volume of inflammatory edema by up to 36%. The involvement of cannabinoid receptors in the analgesic mechanism of the ointment was approximately 73%, and, for the opioid receptors, about 64%. Physiologically significant side effects were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The active components of the ointment are principally different in their mechanism of action and make it possible to relieve pain and inflammation both through the blockade of pain receptors of afferent nociceptive neurons (venom) as well as via cannabinoid and opioid receptors (essential oil)."

Forty-four mice were divided into four groups: untreated control, plain collagen hydrogel, collagen hydrogel with 1% green propolis extract, and collagen hydrogel with 1% oregano extract. Pressure ulcers were induced on their dorsal skin, followed by a 14-day assessment of wound area, contraction, re-epithelialization, dermal collagen density, and levels of reactive oxygen species and nitrite. Results showed significant tissue repair promotion by both propolis and oregano extracts, with oregano exhibiting superior wound contraction. These hydrogels also facilitated skin layer reorganisation and reduced reactive oxygen species and nitrite production. Collagen hydrogels containing these extracts show promising therapeutic potential for pressure ulcer treatment."

Compared to the control group, the film of the PPI/OEO-2.5 % treatment group demonstrated superior mechanical properties. With the increase of the concentration of OEO nanoemulsion, the UV transmittance and water contact angle of the films decreased gradually (more hydrophilic), the opacity and water vapor permeability significantly increased, while the thermal stability, antioxidant properties (DPPH scavenging activity, 17.07 % ∼ 56.00 %), and antibacterial properties were markedly enhanced. The PPI/OEO-2.5 % treated film was applied to the preservation of pork, extending the shelf life by 2-4 days.

      "abstract": "This study compared the antimicrobial activity of several essential oils (EOs) vapor against food spoilage microbiota and further investigated the potential of EO vapor in extending the shelf life of leafy green vegetables. Oregano EO vapor showed stronger antimicrobial activities than basil and clove EO vapors against common spoilage-causing microorganisms in fresh produce, including Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas cichorii, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Pantoea ananatis, Pseudomonas marginalis, Alterneria bassicicola, and Botrytis cinerea. When oregano EO vapor was applied to leafy greens, phytotoxic effects were observed on butter lettuce and iceberg lettuce but not on kai lan and kale. On the contrary, the green color and total chlorophylls of kai lan were preserved by oregano EO vapor. With the use of oregano EO vapor generated by 10 µL oregano EO in a 1.8-L container, the shelf life of kai lan extended from 3 days to at least 7 days when stored at 25°C and from 5 days to at least 14 days when stored at 7°C. The antimicrobial effect was studied with the plating counting method to reflect the dose-dependent amicrobial effect of oregano EO vapor on kai lan. High-throughput 16S/18S DNA sequencing method was applied to evaluate the microbial ecological changes of kai lan under oregano EO vapor treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that oregano EO vapor could be used to extend the shelf life of kai lan. However, the dose of usage must be optimized with care, and one must realize the effectiveness might vary essentially when applying the EO vapor on other types of leafy green vegetables.",

      "abstract": "Given the increasing demand for fruit safety assurance and environmental protection, plant essential oils have gained significant attention as natural alternatives for control of postharvest decay caused by various pathogens. In postharvest management, it is particularly important to effectively control postharvest decay without compromising the quality attributes of fruits. Although oregano essential oil (OEO) has been extensively studied for its antimicrobial properties against various postharvest pathogens, few studies have focused on its interactions with postharvest fruits. In this study, OEO was applied for management of postharvest decay of Pyrus sinkiangensis caused by Penicillium expansum, and its antifungal mechanisms and impacts on the quality attributes of pears were investigated. The OEO exhibited notable inhibitory effects, with determined MIC (0.02%) and MFC (0.04%) against P. expansum, which highlighted its potential as a viable alternative to synthetic fungicides. Our findings revealed that OEO disrupted P. expansum by compromising the integrity of the fungal plasma membrane, as evidenced by changes in plasma membrane permeability and the leakage of cellular components. The OEO treatment significantly reduced weight loss, maintained firmness, and preserved soluble-solid content in the treated pears. In addition, OEO treatment stimulated the intrinsic antioxidant mechanisms of pears, as demonstrated by elevated activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase during storage. This study provides compelling evidence for the antifungal and quality-preserving properties of OEO in the postharvest management of pears, underscoring its potential as an alternative to synthetic fungicides for controlling postharvest decay. The elucidation of the interaction between OEO and P. sinkiangensis would greatly enhance our comprehensive understanding of the biological activities of OEO and facilitate its practical application in the postharvest management of pears."

Although the aromatic plants of the Lamiaceae family often grow in arid regions, drought tolerance varies greatly among the different species of this family. The effect of induced drought stress can be reduced by the application of selenium. The current study aims to compare the growth and biochemical responses of three species of the Lamiaceae family (hyssop, salvia, and oregano) to drought stress and the possibility of reducing the effect of stress in these plants by foliar treatment with selenium. Drought stress reduced the fresh and dry biomass of hyssop (by 35% and 15%), salvia (by 45% and 41%), and oregano (by 51% and 32%). Se treatment did not affect the growth of plants under drought stress, but it improved relative water content in hyssop and salvia under moderate drought conditions. A reduction in the content of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b (in hyssop and salvia). In addition, an increase in the content of hydrogen peroxide (in oregano and salvia), malondialdehyde, and proline in plants cultivated under drought conditions was observed. Se treatment led to reduced levels of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde, along with an increase in chlorophyll a content (in hyssop and oregano) and proline content. The response of the antioxidant system depended on the plant species. Hyssop exhibited a significant increase in glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase activities. Oregano showed enhanced catalase activity. Salvia experienced a sharp increase in ascorbic acid content. Se treatment stimulated the accumulation of phenolic compounds and increased glutathione peroxidase activity in all studied species."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The phytopathogenic genus Fusarium can cause damage such as root and stem rot in economically important crops, with significant implications. To seek a sustainable method for controlling this phytopathogen in seeds, the antifungal activity of essential oils (EOs) from thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and oregano (Origanum vulgare) was evaluated against isolates of F. graminearum, F. equiseti, F. culmorum and F. oxysporum originating from quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) crops in the Boyacá (Colombia). RESULTS: Initially, the effectiveness of commercial fungicides against the mentioned phytopathogenic fungi was evaluated. Upon verifying that these isolates exhibited high resistance to these compounds, the EOs were assessed as a potential control alternative. A disk diffusion assay demonstrated complete in vitro inhibition of the growth of the evaluated phytopathogens when undiluted EOs were used. Subsequently, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these oils was determined using the agar well diffusion technique, revealing a MIC of 10 and 1 μL mL-1 for thyme and oregano oil, respectively. Following this, the antifungal activity of the EOs applied to quinoa seeds was evaluated, and germination indices were measured as an indirect indicator of their toxicity. CONCLUSION: Despite both EOs successfully inhibiting microbial growth in the seeds, it was also found that thyme EO at 100 μL mL-1 and oregano EO at 10 μL mL-1 inhibited seed emergence and germination. However, lower concentrations exhibited a reduction in fungal population without affecting these germination indices. Therefore, it is suggested that the use of these compounds has potential in the treatment and disinfection of quinoa seeds. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "To overcome the antimicrobial residues in food, benzoic acid (BA) and oregano essential oil (OEO) are used in the broiler chicken industry. Independently, both exerted anticoccidial and antimicrobial actions and improved growth performance in broiler chickens. Their effect may be multiplied when they are used in combination. This present study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of dietary BA and OEO alone or in combination as a substitute for a commercial coccidiostatic drug on growth performance and physiological and immunological responses in broiler chickens challenged with Eimeria species. A total of 252 unsexed 1-day-old broiler chicks were equally allotted to 36 pens, each pen containing seven chicks. The pens were randomly assigned to six treatments with six pens (replicates) for each treatment (n = 6)-(i) negative control, (ii) positive control, coccidia-challenged and non-treated, (iii) supplemented with salinomycin (an anti-coccidial drug) at 60 mg/kg of feed and coccidia-challenged, (iv) supplemented with BA at 500 mg/kg of feed and coccidia-challenged, (v) supplemented with OEOat 500 mg/kg of feed and coccidia-challenged (OEO), and (vi) supplemented with BA at 500 mg/kg of feed and OEO at 500 mg/kg of feed and coccidia-challenged (B&O). The liver enzymes and thyroxine and creatinine levels were not affected (p > 0.05) both in coccidia-challenged and supplemented chickens. The BA and OEO applied separately or in combination (B&O) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced gut pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella and Escherichia coli) and Eimeria spp., and concurrently enhanced (p > 0.05) the Lactobacillus population with better body weight gain, improved feed utilization, and superior hematological values. It also up-regulated (p > 0.05) the interferon-γ gene expression and down-regulated (p < 0.05) the interleukin-10 and Toll-like receptor-4 gene expression to protect the chickens from inflammatory reactions, which were not demonstrated in salinomycin-treated birds. The B&O supplementation increased (p < 0.05) the immune system by enhancing Eimeria-specific immunoglobulin Y titer and lymphocyte proliferation response. This study suggests that the combined application of OEO and BA can substitute for a commercial anti-coccidial agent (salinomycin) in controlling coccidiosis as well as improving growth performance, gut health, and immune responses in broiler chickens with a means of antimicrobial-resistant free food products."

      "abstract": "Plant essential oils are unstable due to high volatility and easy oxidation, while microencapsulation provides a potentially effective strategy for increasing the stability of natural essential oils and preserving their function. This study examined the effects of feeding coated oregano essential oil and cinnamaldehyde (COEC) compounds on growth, immune organ development, intestinal morphology, mucosal immune function, and the cecal microbiota populations of broilers. Three hundred one-day-old male Arbor Acres broiler chicks were organized into 5 groups: 1) negative control fed basal diet alone (NC), 2) positive control receiving basal diet plus 50 mg/kg of chlortetracycline (CTC), 3) basal diet plus 150 mg/kg COEC (COEC150), 4) plus 300 mg/kg COEC (COEC300), and 5) plus 450 mg/kg COEC (COEC450). The supplement trial was continued for 42 d. The results showed that CTC, COEC300, and COEC450 treatments decreased the feed conversion ratio of broilers both in the starter and whole experiment phases, increased the height of jejunal villi at 21 d and the number of goblet cells and IgA-producing cells at 21 or 42 d compared with NC group (P < 0.05). Members of the COEC300 treatment group had a higher thymus weight index and jejunum length index than birds of NC or CTC groups at 21 d (P < 0.05). CTC and all COEC treatments decreased malondialdehyde content in jejunal mucosa at 42 d (P < 0.05). The population of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the cecal digesta at 21 d was lower in the CTC, COEC300, and COEC450 treatment groups compared with the NC group (P < 0.05). In contrast to the CTC group, COEC supplementation dose-dependently accelerated body weight gain, improved jejunal morphology, decreased malondialdehyde content in jejunal mucosa, increased numbers of jejunal goblet cells and IgA-producing cells, and decreased the E. coli population in cecal digesta at 21 or 42 d (P < 0.05). Thus, we concluded that feeding broiler chickens with 300 or 450 mg/kg in antibiotic-free diets can improve growth performance, enhance immune responses, and inhibit the proliferation of cecal pathogenic bacteria.",

However, its poor water solubility and chemical instability limit its application in preservation. In this study, we determined the composition of OEO and encapsulated it in microcapsules using gelatin/carrageenan (GE/CRG) as the capsule wall, achieving a particle size of 336.10 nm and an encapsulation efficiency of 87.79 %. The microcapsules realize the slow-release duration of OEO to over 80 h. More importantly, due to the slow-release effect of OEO, OEO-GE/CRG microcapsules demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against B. cinerea with an EC50 value of 0.18 mg/mL. The microcapsule treatment significantly prolonged the preservation period of cherry tomatoes in infection models with B. cinerea. These results indicate that OEO-GE/CRG microcapsules could serve as a potential fungal inhibitor and agent for fruit storage and preservation.",

This study was carried out to investigate hazardous biochemical and histological reactions to MOP and evaluate the effectiveness of TEO and OEO essential oils in restoring normal physiological conditions after MOP exposure by measuring enzyme-specific activity for Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). One hundred and twenty rats were divided into six groups of twenty animals each: (i) C - MOP served as the control group, (ii) C + MOP treated with 5 mg/kg/BW of Malathion-D10, (iii) TEO treated with 100 mg/kg/BW of oregano essential oil, (iv) TEO treated with 100 mg/kg/BW of thyme essential oil, (v) MOP + OEO treated with 5 mg/kg/BW of Malathion-D10 and 100 mg/kg/BW of oregano essential oil, and (vi) MOP + TEO treated with 5 mg/kg/BW of Malathion-D10 and 100 mg/kg/BW of thyme essential oil. The results indicated the protective effects of OEO and TEO against MOP-induced weight loss. Additionally, there was a significant improvement in ALT, AST, and ALK-Ph after being treated with OEO and TEO, either alone or after MOP exposure. Also, treatment with OEO and TEO ameliorated these oxidative stress parameters, indicating their antioxidative properties. A histopathological examination of liver tissues showed reduced hepatocellular damage and improved liver architecture in the OEO and TEO, both alone and in combination with MOP, and protective effects were more pronounced in the TEO-treated groups. However, the results indicated that TEO was more effective than OEO in increasing CYP1A2 expression and alleviating MOP-induced toxicity. Specifically, TEO showed higher protein expression and therapeutic action in reducing liver damage. In conclusion, these findings suggest that OEO and TEO may be potent therapeutic agents against MOP toxicity, offering protective effects by enhancing CYP1A2 activity and mitigating organ damage. Such knowledge would be an important step toward developing potentially unique treatment options for natural antitoxins."

HS is difficult to cure in the clinic and current therapies lead to recurrence, pain, and side effects. In this study, a natural amphiphilic polymer mucin is used to prepare a dissolving microneedle (muMN) that is loaded with oregano essential oil (OEO) for HS therapy. muMN exhibits sufficient skin/scar tissue penetration, quick skin recovery time after removal, good loading of natural essential oil, fast dissolution and detachment from the base layer, and good biocompatibility to applied skin. In the rabbit HS model, OEO@muMN shows a significant reduction in scar thickness, epidermal thickness index, and scar elevation index. OEO@muMN also attenuates the mean collagen area fraction and decreases the number of capillaries in scar tissues. Biochemical Assay reveals that OEO@muMN significantly inhibits the expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and hydroxyproline (HYP). In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility and good efficacy of using the anti-proliferative and anti-oxidative OEO for HS treatment. OEO@muMN is an efficient formulation that holds the potential for clinical anti-HS application. muMN is an efficient platform to load and apply essential oils transdermally.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phytogenic additives would be helpful to mitigate the detrimental impact of Campylobacter jejuni on broiler chickens. OBJECTIVE: The experiment aimed to assess the effects of cinnamon, rosemary and oregano powder on physiological responses of broiler chickens challenged with C. jejuni from 0 to 42 days of age. METHODS: A total of 192 one-day-old male broiler chickens were divided into 6 treatment groups. The treatments included: negative control (NC; basal diet without additives and no C. jejuni challenge), positive control (PC; basal diet with C. jejuni challenge), PC with cinnamon, rosemary or oregano powder (3 g/kg each), and PC with Erythromycin (55 mg/kg). Except for the NC group, all chicks were orally challenged with 2 × 108 CFU/mL C. jejuni daily from days 21-25. Feed intake, body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), energy efficiency ratio (EER) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) were assessed during the rearing period (0-42 days). On day 42 of age, fresh excreta samples were collected from each pen to determine apparent dry matter digestibility and excreta microbiota. In addition, at the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected to evaluate blood profile and liver enzyme activities. RESULTS: C. jejuni challenge (PC treatment) decreased BWG, EER and PER, while increasing FCR of broiler chickens (p < 0.05), whereas rosemary, oregano and Erythromycin improved these performance parameters akin to NC. PC diet showed negative effect in ileal morphology, alleviated by additives except cinnamon (p < 0.05). Dietary additives successfully reduced Campylobacter levels and increased Lactobacilli counts in the PC. Rosemary and oregano lowered plasma total cholesterol (p < 0.05). Alanine aminotransferase elevation by C. jejuni challenge in the PC group was prevented by rosemary, oregano and Erythromycin (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Oregano and rosemary alleviate the impact of C. jejuni challenge.",

      "abstract": "The widespread use of MLT may pose numerous hazards to animal breeding, health, and resilience due to the presence of MLT residues in animal feedstuffs, pastures, hay, and cereals. Many medicinal plants provide what is called a generalized anti-toxic remedy. The current study examined hazardous biochemical and histological reactions to MLT and the efficiency of ThEO and OEO essential oils as anti-toxic therapies to return to a natural state after MLT exposure. A total of 75 male albino rats were randomly assigned to two groups: (i) C - MLT, comprising 25 rats, served as the control group; and (ii) C + MLT, with 50 rats that were exposed to 5 mg/kg/BW. After exposure to MLT for 21 days, a return to normal status was determined by subdividing the C + MLT group into two equal groups: ThEO and OEO were used as treatments, with 100 mg/kg body weight of thyme and oregano essential oils, respectively, being administered for 21 days. The results showed a significant decrease in body weight gain (BWG) and final weight (FW) compared to C - MLT, while the therapeutic effects of ThEO and OEO enhanced FW and BWG. Our results indicated that MLT exposure resulted in deficient serum liver function, but that OEO and ThEO therapy brought about a significant improvement in liver enzyme function. Although there was no significant difference in serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALK-Ph) and a significant drop in alanine transaminase (ALT) and acetyl choline-esterase (AChE) levels, the C + MLT group showed hepatic fibrosis in the third stage. Furthermore, histological sections of the OEO and ThEO groups showed reduced hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis. However, there was a significant increase in serum creatinine between the C + MLT and C - MLT groups following exposure to MLT. Histological sections of renal tissue from rats treated with OEO and ThEO showed reduced tubular damage, reduced interstitial inflammation, and preserved renal tissue architecture. In conclusion, OEO and ThEO are potential compounds for use as anti-toxic therapies to return to a natural state after MLT exposure. These compounds could serve as an experimental therapeutic approach against natural toxins, providing a solution to the problems of raising livestock that are exposed to nutritional toxicity."

      "abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is characterized as a very common fungal infection that significantly affects women's health worldwide. Essential oils (EOs) are currently being evaluated as an alternative therapy. The development of efficient techniques such as micro- or nanoencapsulation for protecting and controlling release is essential to overcome the limitations of EO applications. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and characterize oregano EO-loaded keratin microparticles (OEO-KMPs) as a potential treatment for VVC. OEO-KMPs were produced using high-intensity ultrasonic cycles and characterized in terms of morphological and physicochemical parameters. In vitro evaluation included assessing the toxicity of the OEO-KMPs and their effect against Candida albicans using microdilution and agar diffusion, while the activity against biofilm was quantified using colony forming units (CFU). The efficacy of the OEO-KMPs in an in vivo VVC mouse model was also studied. Female BALB/c mice were intravaginally infected with C. albicans, 24 h postinfection animals were treated intravaginally with 15 μL of OEO-KMPs and 24 h later vaginal fluid was analyzed for C. albicans and Lactobacillus growth (CFU mL-1). The results showed the stability of the OEO-KMPs over time, with high encapsulation efficiency and controlled release. This nanoparticle size facilitated penetration and completely inhibited the planktonic growth of C. albicans. In addition, an in vitro application of 2.5% of the OEO-KMPs eradicated mature C. albicans biofilms while preserving Lactobacillus species. In in vivo, a single intravaginal application of OEO-KMPs induced a reduction in C. albicans growth, while maintaining Lactobacillus species. In conclusion, this therapeutic approach with OEO-KMPs is promising as a potential alternative or complementary therapy for VVC while preserving vaginal microflora.",

Also, the resistance pattern to antibiotics of each strain was determined. The results showed resistance pattern (8 out of 12 antibiotics tested) for P. aureginosa, while E. coli and P. vulgaris were resistant to 4 antibiotics out of the 12 tested. On the other hand, fractionated oregano caused an inhibition of growth and a reduction in motility, varying between fractions and among bacteria. Fraction 4 showed major growth reduction, with MBC values ranging from 0.002 to 23.7 mg/mL. Treatment with fractionated oregano (F1, F2, F3, F4) reduced the motility by 92-81% for P. vulgaris, 90-83% for E. coli, and 100-8.9% for P. aeruginosa. These results demonstrated a higher performance with a lower application dose due to its high content of Carvacrol and Thymol; unlike other concentrated fractions, this synergy of oxygenated monoterpenes may cause greater antimicrobial activity."

However, at high inclusions, SBM has been shown to have negative impacts presenting as reduced feed intake and intestinal inflammation. Medicinal plant extracts, namely essential oils, have been used to promote growth performance and immune response. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of oregano (Origanum vulgare) essential oil (OEO) inclusion on utilization of a high-inclusion SBM diet using zebrafish as a model. Five diets were used in this study: reference-FM-based diet, control-55.7% inclusion SBM diet, and three experimental SBM-based diets OEO1, OEO2, and OEO3 that were supplemented with 1%, 2%, or 3% of oregano oil, respectively. The FM group had overall better growth performance when compared with the other treatment groups; however, the OEO3 mean weight and feed conversion ratio were not significantly different from the FM group (p > 0.05) and were significantly improved compared with the SBM group (p < 0.05). Similarly, OEO2 total length was not significantly different from FM (p > 0.05) but significantly higher than the SBM group (p < 0.05). Expression of inflammation-related genes did not significantly differ between the OEO groups and the SBM-only group. However, the OEO2 and OEO3 groups displayed improved growth performance compared with the SBM group, suggesting that inclusion of OEO at or above 2% inclusion may help to alleviate common symptoms induced by a high-inclusion SBM diet.",

      "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is a prevalent foodborne pathogen with a remarkable capacity to form biofilms on utensil surfaces. The Listeriolysin O (LLO) exhibits hemolytic activity, which is responsible for causing human infections. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect and mechanism of oregano essential oil (OEO) on L. monocytogenes, evaluated the effects on its biofilm removal and hemolytic activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OEO against L. monocytogenes was 0.03 % (v/v). L. monocytogenes was treated with OEO at 3/2 MIC for 30 min the bacteria was decreased below the detection limit (10 CFU/mL) in PBS and TSB (the initial bacterial load was about 6.5 log CFU/mL). The level of L. monocytogenes in minced pork co-cultured with OEO (15 MIC) about 2.5 log CFU/g lower than that in the untreated group. The inhibitory mechanisms of OEO against planktonic L. monocytogenes encompassed perturbation of cellular morphology, elevation in reactive oxygen species levels, augmentation of lipid oxidation extent, hyperpolarization of membrane potential, and reduction in intracellular ATP concentration. In addition, OEO reduced biofilm coverage on the surface of glass slides by 62.03 % compared with the untreated group. Meanwhile, OEO (1/8 MIC) treatment reduced the hemolytic activity of L. monocytogenes to 24.6 % compared with the positive control. Molecular docking suggested carvacrol and thymol might reduce the hemolytic activity of L. monocytogenes. The results of this study demonstrate that OEO exhibits inhibitory effects against L. monocytogenes, biofilms and LLO, which had potential as natural antimicrobial for the inhibition of L. monocytogenes.",

It also investigated the effects on the activity of digestive enzymes, microbiological composition, and the expression of antioxidant and tight junction-related proteins. Three hundred- and fifty-day-old male broilers, were randomly assigned to 7 treatment groups, with each group comprising 5 replicates, and each replicate containing 10 chicks in a cage. The diets were: 1) a basal diet, 2) a diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg of rosemary, 3) a diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg of rosemary, 4) a diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg of oregano, 5) a diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg of oregano, 6) a combination diet containing 50 mg/kg each of rosemary and oregano, and 7) a combination diet containing 100 mg/kg each of rosemary and oregano. Dietary oregano extract enhanced the growth and feed utilization of heat-stressed birds, especially at a concentration of 50 mg/kg. Moreover, oregano extract improved jejunal protease and amylase activities. The extracts of rosemary and oregano significantly reduced IgG and IgM levels. Dietary 50 mg oregano extract significantly upregulated intestinal integrity-related genes including jejunal CLDNI, ZO-1, ZO-2, and MUC2. Dietary 50 mg oregano extract significantly downregulated hepatic NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expressions. Our results suggest that incorporating oregano leaf extract into the diet at a concentration of 50 mg/kg improves the growth performance of broilers exposed to heat stress. This improvement could be attributed to enhanced gut health and the modulation of genes associated with oxidative stress and tight junction proteins.",

      "abstract": "With a growing global concern over food safety and animal welfare issues, the livestock and veterinary industries are undergoing unprecedented changes. These changes have not only brought challenges within each industry, but also brought unprecedented opportunities for development. In this context, the search for natural and safe products that can effectively replace traditional veterinary drugs has become an important research direction in the fields of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. Oregano essential oil (OEO), as a natural extract, is gradually emerging in the fields of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine with its unique antibacterial, antioxidant, and multiple other biological activities. OEO not only has a wide antibacterial spectrum, effectively fighting against a variety of pathogenic microorganisms, but also, because of its natural properties, helps us to avoid traditional veterinary drugs that may bring drug residues or cause drug resistance problems. This indicates OEO has great application potential in animal disease treatment, animal growth promotion, and animal welfare improvement. At present, the application of OEO in the fields of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine has achieved preliminary results. Studies have shown that adding OEO to animal feed can significantly improve the growth performance and health status of animals and reduce the occurrence of disease. At the same time, pharmacokinetic studies in animals show that the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes of OEO in animals shows good bioavailability. In summary, oregano essential oil (OEO), as a substitute for natural veterinary drugs with broad application prospects, is gradually becoming a research hotspot in the field of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. In the future, we look forward to further tapping the potential of OEO through more research and practice and making greater contributions to the sustainable development of the livestock and veterinary industries."

      "abstract": "The hazard of diseases created by S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium is relatively high in turkey meat products. Combinations of preservation methods are utilized in many strategies, such as mild heat with decreased water activity, a changed atmosphere, refrigerated storage, and decreased heat treatment with some acidification. Within the domain of ready-to-eat food technology, a range of preservation methods are typically utilized to enhance shelf life, such as applying mild heat in tandem with reduced water activity, employing modified atmosphere packaging, utilizing refrigerated storage, and utilizing reduced heat treatment combined with acidification. This investigation aimed to determine how S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium grew when sliced ready-to-eat smoked turkey (RTE-SM) was stored at 0, 5, 10, and 15°C for various periods. The study also examined the effects of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) (40% CO2 and 60% N2) and VP on these growth patterns. Total viable count (TVC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), pH, and redox potential levels were determined. The control experiment on RTE-SM showed no Salmonella growth within 30 d of storage at any temperature. This indicated that the RTE-SM in use did not initially contain S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. Results indicated that the storage of RTE-SM using a combination of VP, MAP, and MAPEO with storage at 0 and 5°C did not allow for the pathogen to grow throughout storage. In comparison, at 10 and 15°C after one day, which allowed for minor growth (0.17-0.5 log CFU/g)? In contrast, at 0 and 5°C, Salmonella survives until the end of storage (173 d). However, the combination of MAPEO with the same storage temperatures achieved the elimination of the pathogen in the meat after 80 d. The combination of both packaging systems with high temperatures (10 or 15°C) allowed for the multiplication and growth of the bacterium through the product's shelf life of more than 1 log CFU/g. Thus, a combination of MAP or MAPEO with low storage temperatures (0 or 5°C) inhibited the growth of the pathogen.",

Prior research suggests that oregano essential oil (OEO) exhibits diverse biological effects, including antiparasitic activity against Toxoplasma gondii. Given concerns about current treatments, exploring new compounds is important. This study was to assess the toxicity of OEO on BeWo cells and T. gondii tachyzoites, as well as to evaluate its effectiveness in in vitro infection models and determine its direct action on free tachyzoites. OEO toxicity on BeWo cells and T. gondii tachyzoites was assessed by MTT and trypan blue methods, determining cytotoxic concentration (CC50), inhibitory concentration (IC50), and selectivity index (SI). Infection and proliferation indices were analyzed. Direct assessments of the parasite included reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, necrosis, and apoptosis, as well as electron microscopy. Oregano oil exhibited low cytotoxicity on BeWo cells (CC50: 114.8 µg/mL ± 0.01) and reduced parasite viability (IC50 12.5 ± 0.06 µg/mL), demonstrating 9.18 times greater selectivity for parasites than BeWo cells. OEO treatment significantly decreased intracellular proliferation in infected cells by 84% after 24 h with 50 μg/mL. Mechanistic investigations revealed increased ROS levels, mitochondrial depolarization, and lipid droplet formation, linked to autophagy induction and plasma membrane permeabilization. These alterations, observed through electron microscopy, suggested a necrotic process confirmed by propidium iodide labeling. OEO treatment demonstrated anti-T. gondii action through cellular and metabolic change while maintaining low toxicity to trophoblastic cells.",

Oreganum vulgare L. essential oil (OVO) showed a broad antibacterial effect, with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values ranging from 94 to 754 µg cm-3 air, depending on the bacterial species. Then, gaseous OVO was used for the treatment of stainless steel, polypropylene, and glass surfaces contaminated with four bacterial pathogens at 6-7 log cfu coupon-1. No viable cells were found after OVO treatment on all food-contact surfaces contaminated with all pathogens, with the exception of Sta. aureus DSM 799 on the glass surface. The antimicrobial activity of OVO after the addition of beef extract as a soiling agent reduced the Sta. aureus DSM 799 viable cell count by more than 5 log cfu coupon-1 on polypropylene and glass, while no viable cells were found in the case of stainless steel. HS-GC-MS analysis of the headspace of the boxes used for the antibacterial assay revealed 14 different volatile compounds with α-Pinene (62-63%), and p-Cymene (21%) as the main terpenes. In conclusion, gaseous OVO could be used for the microbial decontamination of food-contact surfaces, although its efficacy needs to be evaluated since it depends on several parameters such as target microorganisms, food-contact material, temperature, time of contact, and relative humidity."

The aim of the study is to investigate the protective effects of oregano oil (Origanum minutiflorum extract oil) against CCl4-induced liver injury. Two doses of oregano oil were used in the experiment: a low dose (LD; 20 mg/kg) and a high dose (HD; 60 mg/kg) during 2 weeks. CCl4 caused severe liver damage, nucleolus destruction in hepatocytes and cytogenetic changes in the nucleus. Indirectly, CCl4 causes decreased protein synthesis and significantly high creatinine and urea values. Hematological disorders have been recorded, such as decreased RBC and hemoglobin concentration, increased WBC and deformability of the erythrocyte membrane. Both doses of oregano oil had protective effects. Improved protein synthesis and high globulins level, creatinine and urea were found in both groups. Cytogenetic changes in the nucleus of hepatocytes were reduced. A high dose of oregano oil had maximal protective effects for RBC, but a very weak effect on hemoglobin synthesis. Also, WBC and lymphocyte values were low. Origanum stimulates protein synthesis and recovery of hepatocytes after liver injury, reduces the deformability of the erythrocyte membrane. High doses of oregano oil decreased WBC and lymphocytes which may lead to a weakening of the immune response. However, high doses are more effective against severe platelet aggregation than low doses, suggesting an effective treatment against thrombocytosis.",

      "abstract": "Candida albicans, a polymorphic yeast, is a physiological component of the human and animal commensal microbiome. It is an etiological factor of candidiasis, which is treated by azole antifungals. Growing resistance to azoles is a reason to look for other alternative treatment options. The pharmacotherapeutic use of plant extracts and essential oils has become increasingly important. In our experiment, C. albicans showed susceptibility to four observed plant extracts and essential oils from peppermint ( Mentha piperita), thyme ( Thymus vulgaris), sage ( Salvia officinalis), and oregano ( Origanum vulgare). Oregano plant extract and essential oil showed the highest antifungal activity, at MIC values of 4.9 mg/mL and 0.4 mg/mL respectively. Therefore, it was subjected to further research on the influence of virulence factors - biofilm formation, extracellular phospholipase production and germ tube formation. Oregano plant extract and essential oil showed an inhibitory effect on the observed C. albicans virulence factors at relatively low concentrations. The extract inhibited the adherence of cells at MIC 12.5 mg/mL and essential oil at MIC 0.25 mg/mL. Degradation of the formed biofilm was detected at MIC 14.1 mg/mL for plant extract and at MIC 0.4 mg/mL for essential oil. Extracellular phospholipase production was most effectively inhibited by the essential oil. In particular, the number of isolates with intensive extracellular phospholipase production decreased significantly. Of the 12 isolates intensively producing extracellular phospholipase, only 1 isolate (4.5%) retained intense production. Essential oil caused up to a 100 % reduction in germ tubes formation and plant extract reduced their formation depending on the concentration as follows: 2.6% (0.8 mg/mL), 21.2 % (6.25 mg/mL), and 64.5 % (12.5 mg/mL) compared to the control.",

At each storage time, egg yolks were analysed for fatty acid profile and lipid peroxidation.3. The main indicator of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde (MDA), was significantly lower in ORE eggs compared to CON eggs (p = 0.001). Storage time had a significant impact on MDA concentrations (p = 0.023), with the highest found after 35 d. Significant differences were found for individual fatty acids, saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid were significantly lower in ORE eggs compared to CON eggs (p < 0.05). Palmitoleic acid (p = 0.002), linolenic acid (p = 0.001) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in ORE eggs.4. Storage only affected oleic, linolenic, linoleic, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids (p < 0.05). Total SFA, MUFA, n-6 and ratio of n-3 to n-6 (n-3:n-6) PUFA were significantly higher in CON eggs (p < 0.05). The ratio of SFA to PUFA (SFA:PUFA, p = 0.005) and total n-3 PUFA (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in ORE eggs.5. The n-3:n-6 ratio was significantly impacted by treatment (p = 0.021) and storage (p = 0.031) with no significant interaction. This ratio is important for human health indication and could lead to the development of designer eggs.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the protective action of oregano (Origanum vulgare) essential oil and its monoterpene constituents (thymol and carvacrol) in L-arginine-induced kidney damage by studying inflammatory and tissue damage parameters. The determination of biochemical markers that reflect kidney function, i.e., serum levels of urea and creatinine, tissue levels of neutrophil-gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), as well as a panel of oxidative-stress-related and inflammatory biomarkers, was performed. Furthermore, histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of kidneys obtained from different experimental groups were conducted. Pre-treatment with the investigated compounds prevented an L-arginine-induced increase in serum and tissue kidney damage markers and, additionally, decreased the levels of inflammation-related parameters (TNF-α and nitric oxide concentrations and myeloperoxidase activity). Micromorphological kidney tissue changes correlate with the alterations observed in the biochemical parameters, as well as the expression of CD95 in tubule cells and CD68 in inflammatory infiltrate cells. The present results revealed that oregano essential oil, thymol, and carvacrol exert nephroprotective activity, which could be, to a great extent, associated with their anti-inflammatory, antiradical scavenging, and antiapoptotic action and, above all, due to their ability to lessen the disturbances arising from acute pancreatic damage. Further in-depth studies are needed in order to provide more detailed explanations of the observed activities.",

      "abstract": "The present study evaluated, in laboratory and field, the efficacy and safety of formulations of Pelargonium graveolens (geranium - G), Origanum majorana (oregano - O) commercial essential oils (EO) and thymol (T) to control of Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato. In the laboratory, three formulas (A: 2% tween 80%, B: powder and C: nanoemulsion) by a mixture of these components (GOT) were prepared and evaluated, and the best one was used to assess its safety and field application against R. sanguineus s. l. on naturally infested dogs. Besides the major compounds of the EO used were identified. The results of the lab study showed that formula A (2.5 g of each G + O + T + 2% tween 80 to complete 100 mL) was significantly more effective than the other two formulas tested and exhibited highly effective adulticidal, larvicidal, and ovicidal activity against R. sanguineus s.l. Significant LC50 and LC90 values of GOT were evaluated (13.4 and 21.5 mg/mL, respectively) for the adulticidal activity, (2.81 and 4.46 mg/mL, respectively) for ovicidal activity and (2.44 and 4.45 mg/mL, respectively) for larvicidal activity. The safety of formula A has been proven by the absence of its cytotoxicity on a cell line of human epidermoid carcinoma. Citronella and carvacrol were the major compounds identified in the commercial essential oils of P. graveolens and O. majorana, respectively. Formula A was used in a field control trial for almost 8 months, during the tick infestation season (April to November, 2022). Fourteen naturally infested dogs were divided into two groups, each with seven dogs. One group received formula A spraying five times during an experiment that continued for 8 months, while the other group received treatment with commercially available malathion acaricide. The animals were sprayed on five occasions throughout the experiment (April, June, July, August, and September). The results showed a substantial percentage of effectiveness after the first application of formula A with a 99.3% reduction in tick count at day 28 post-application (PA). In the case of severe infestation 60 days after the first application of formula A (more than 180 ticks per dog), the second application was done, achieving an efficacy of 54.9% at day 3 PA, so an emergency spray was done at day 5 PA to combat the rest of the tick infestation, achieving efficacy of 99% after 3 days. Consequently, a regular spray (third, fourth, and fifth application) was done every 35 days. This regular spray revealed 100% effectiveness at 14 days PA. Biochemical parameters of treated dogs were evaluated to confirm the safety of formula A. Creatinine, ALT, and albumin of the dogs treated with formula A were within the normal range of dogs, while urea and AST were higher than the normal range. In conclusion, formula A can safely treat R. sanguineus s.l. infestations in dogs with regular application every 5 weeks.",

We also monitored antimicrobial resistance in the commensal indicator E. coli. Histological parameters and intestinal microbiota were measured in 140 piglets weaned at 21 days of age. Seven dietary treatments were used: a negative control group (basal diet), a positive control group with ZnO (3000 mg/kg of food), two groups with OEO at 0.4% and 1.2%, respectively, two groups with PGP 0.4% and 2%, respectively, and a group with OEO with 1.2% combined with PGP with 2%. Each group of piglets received the treatment for seven weeks, from weaning, before samples were taken. Antibiotic resistance profiles were measured in 81 E. coli strains. On this occasion, only the control groups, ZnO, OEO 1.2%, PGP 2% and OEO 1.2% + PGP 2% were used, and the samples were obtained from the cecal content. A progressive loss of the bioactive components of OEO and PGP was observed during the 34 days of storage (p < 0.05). PGP 2%, OEO 1.2% and their combination showed results similar to ZnO (p > 0.05), or superior in the study of intestinal morphometry and the values of E. coli and Lactobacillus. All categories showed high levels of resistance. Only the strains isolated from the OEO 1.2% group did not show resistance to colistin and presented the lowest resistance values. In general, high doses of the additives studied showed the best results, obtaining levels like or higher than those offered by ZnO."

Steam sterilization and gamma-irradiation were the most effective treatments in inactivating microorganisms. These treatments resulted in 0.87-2.15 log reductions in total aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts and reduced yeast-mold and Enterobacteriaceae counts below the detectable level. Steam sterilization caused increased levels of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and decreased levels of their N-oxide forms (PANOs) demonstrating a simultaneous conversion of PANOs into the corresponding PAs. Ozone treatment caused significant decreases in the levels of individual and total PAs/PANOs. After ozone treatment, decreases of 54.4, 53.9, 61.6 and 61.4% were observed in the levels of europine-N-oxide, europine, lasiocarpine-N-oxide and lasiocarpine, respectively. Steam sterilization, UV-irradiation and ozone treatments significantly altered the composition of the volatile compounds of oregano as evidenced by decreased levels of major components and the formation of some new compounds.",

For that, 5 treatments were performed as follows: TSA-control treatment; TES with the addition of sodium erythorbate; and formulation TOE1 with 600 ppm oregano essential oil; TOE2 with 1000 ppm essential oil; and TOE3 with 1400 ppm essential oil. The pâtés showed adequate technological and physicochemical characteristics and microbiological counts within the legislation standards. No significant differences were observed in the luminosity of the pâté formulations during storage, and the addition of oil contributed to the increase in a* values and stability of b* values. Regarding the lipid and protein oxidation, TOE3 showed lower values at the end of the shelf-life. The addition of essential oil did not affect the hardness and cohesiveness of the products. The fatty acids in greater amounts in the samples were linoleic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. The analysis of biogenic amines indicated that only the treatments with the highest amounts of sodium erythorbate (TES and TOE1) showed losses of spermidine. It was observed that decreasing the inclusion of sodium erythorbate and increasing the inclusion of oregano essential oil resulted in a drop in cadaverine values. A total of 46 volatile compounds were detected in the samples with the highest amount of free fatty acids and all the formulations were well accepted sensorially.",

      "abstract": "Origanum vulgare L. is an aromatic plant that exerts antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activities, mainly due to its essential oil (EO) content. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanism underlying the in vitro antitumor activity of EO extracted by hydrodistillation of dried flowers and leaves of Origanum vulgare L. grown in Sicily (Italy) in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of Oregano essential oil (OEO) composition highlighted the presence of twenty-six major phytocompounds, such as p-cymene, γ-terpinene, and thymoquinone p-acetanisole. OEO possesses strong antioxidant capacity, as demonstrated by the DPPH test. Our studies provided evidence that OEO reduces the viability of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The cytotoxic effect of OEO on breast cancer cells was partially counteracted by the addition of z-VAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor. Caspases and mitochondrial dysfunction appeared to be involved in the OEO-induced death mechanism. Western blotting analysis showed that OEO-induced activation of pro-caspases-9 and -3 and fragmentation of PARP decreased the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL while increasing those of Bax and VDAC. In addition, fluorescence microscopy and cytofluorimetric analysis showed that OEO induces a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in both cell lines. Furthermore, we tested the effects of p-cymene, γ-terpinene, thymoquinone, and p-acetanisole, which are the main components of OEO. Our findings highlighted that the effect of OEO on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells appears to be mainly due to the combination of different constituents of OEO, providing evidence of the potential use of OEO for breast cancer treatment.",

The limited effective antibiotics have encouraged the development of innovative strategies such as using essential oils and their constituents. This study evaluated the efficacy of oregano (Lippia graveolens) essential oil (OEO) and its terpene compounds, carvacrol and thymol, in inhibiting A. baumannii biofilms. These treatments showed a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.6, 0.3, and 2.5 mg/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration of 1.2, 0.6, and 5 mg/mL, respectively. Sub-inhibitory doses of each treatment and the OEO significantly reduced biofilm biomass and the covered area of A. baumannii biofilms as measured by fluorescence microscopy. Carvacrol at 0.15 mg/mL exhibited the most potent efficacy, achieving a remarkable 95% reduction. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of carvacrol significantly reduced the biofilm formation of A. baumannii in stainless steel surfaces by up to 1.15 log CFU/cm2 compared to untreated bacteria. The OEO and thymol exhibited reductions of 0.6 log CFU/cm2 and 0.4 log CFU/cm2, respectively, without affecting cell viability. Moreover, the terpenes inhibited twitching motility, a crucial step in biofilm establishment, with carvacrol exhibiting the highest inhibition, followed by OEO and thymol. The study provides valuable insights into the potential of terpenes as effective agents against A. baumannii biofilms, offering promising avenues for developing novel strategies to prevent persistent infections and overcome antibiotic resistance."

The groups supplemented with BS and ORO demonstrated significantly higher villus height/crypt depth ratios than the Con group. Microbial richness was significantly higher in groups supplemented with BS (p = 0.0317) and ORO (p = 0.00794) than in the Con group. These findings revealed a distinct separation between gut microbial communities of the Con group and those supplemented with ORO, based on unweighted and weighted UniFrac indices. Therefore, supplementation with Bacillus subtilis and oregano oil improved the composition of the microbiota, suggesting their positive effects on the gut health of pullets."

      "abstract": "Skin tags, also known as fibroepithelial polyps (FPs) or acrochordons, are soft, pigmented excrescences, with a prevalence of 50-60% in the population, occurring especially in the fourth decade of life. To date, FPs have been efficiently eliminated using minimum invasive methods such as surgical removal, cauterization, laser irradiation, and cryosurgery. Over-the-counter treatments are also of interest for patients due to their non-invasive character, but their clinical efficiency has not been clearly demonstrated. This study was designed in order to evaluate the efficacy of a modern-pharmaceutical-formulation-type poloxamer-based binary hydrogel, having Origanum vulgare L. essential oil (OEO-PbH) as an active ingredient in the management of FPs. The formulation has been shown to possess good qualities in terms of stability and sterility. Non-invasive measurements revealed changes in some physiological skin parameters. An increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and erythema index was noted, while skin surface water content (SWC) decreased during eight weeks of treatment. The macroscopic evaluation revealed that the FPs dried and shrunk after topical treatment with OEO-PbH. Clinically, patients presented a lowering of the number of lesions on the treated area of 20-30% after one month of treatment and around 50% after the second month. Histopathological examination suggests that topical treatment with OEO-PbH may induce histological changes in the epidermis, dermis, and fibrovascular cores of FPs, including a loss of thickness, reduced size and number of blood vessels, and low cellularity. These changes may contribute to the observed reduction in size of FPs after treatment with OEO-PbH."

OEO effectively killed S. flexneri in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and contaminated minced pork (the initial population of S. flexneri was about 7.0 log CFU/mL or 7.2 log CFU/g), and after treatment with OEO at 2 MIC in LB broth or at 15 MIC in minced pork, the population of S. flexneri decreased to an undetectable level after 2 or 9 h, respectively. OEO increased intracellular reactive oxygen species concentration, destroyed cell membrane, changed cell morphology, decreased intracellular ATP concentration, caused cell membrane depolarization, and destroyed proteins or inhibited proteins synthesis of S. flexneri. In addition, OEO effectively eradicated the biofilm of S. flexneri by effectively inactivating S. flexneri in mature biofilm, destroying the three-dimensional structure, and reducing exopolysaccharide biomass of S. flexneri. In conclusion, OEO exerts its antimicrobial action effectively and also has a valid scavenging effect on the biofilm of S. flexneri. These findings suggest that OEO has the potential to be used as a natural antibacterial and antibiofilm material in the control of S. flexneri in meat product supply chain, thereby preventing meat-associated infections.",

      "abstract": "American tegumentary leishmaniasis, a zoonotic disease caused by the Leishmania genus, poses significant challenges in treatment, including administration difficulty, low efficacy, and parasite resistance. Novel compounds or associations offer alternative therapies, and natural products such as oregano essential oil (OEO), extracted from Origanum vulgare, have been extensively researched due to biological effects, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic properties. Silver nanoparticles (AgNp), a nanomaterial with compelling antimicrobial and antiparasitic activity, have been shown to exhibit potent leishmanicidal properties. We evaluated the in vitro effect of OEO and AgNp-Bio association on L. amazonensis and the death mechanisms of the parasite involved. Our results demonstrated a synergistic antileishmanial effect of OEO + AgNp on promastigote forms and L. amazonensis-infected macrophages, which induced morphological and ultrastructural changes in promastigotes. Subsequently, we investigated the mechanisms underlying parasite death and showed an increase in NO, ROS, mitochondrial depolarization, accumulation of lipid-storage bodies, autophagic vacuoles, phosphatidylserine exposure, and damage to the plasma membrane. Moreover, the association resulted in a reduction in the percentage of infected cells and the number of amastigotes per macrophage. In conclusion, our findings establish that OEO + AgNp elicits a late apoptosis-like mechanism to combat promastigote forms and promotes ROS and NO production in infected macrophages to target intracellular amastigote forms."

      "abstract": "The active components, potential targets, and mechanisms of action of oregano essential oil in the treatment of bovine mastitis disease were investigated using network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches. The TCMSP and literature databases were examined for the main compounds in oregano essential oil. Afterward, the physical, chemical, and bioavailability characteristics of the components were evaluated. The PubChem, BATMAN, PharmMapper, and Uniprot databases were utilized to predict the target genes of the major components of oregano essential oil. Via the databases of DrugBank, OMIM, GeneCards, TTD, and DisGenet, the disease targets of bovine mastitis were discovered. We analyzed common targets and built protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using the STRING database. Key genes were analyzed, obtained, and compound-target-pathway-disease visualization networks were created using Cytoscape. For the GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, the DAVID database was utilized. Molecular docking via Autodock Tools was utilized to evaluate the reliability of the interactions between oregano essential oil and hub targets. Thymol, carvacrol, and p-cymene are the three major components found in oregano essential oil. The potential targets (TNF, TLR4, ALB, IL-1β, TLR2, IL-6, IFNG, and MyD88) were screened according to the visual network. The enrichment analysis suggested that the major signaling pathways in network pharmacology may include PI3K-Akt, MAPK, IL-17, and NF-κ B. Molecular docking analysis shows that thymol had good docking activity with TNF, IL-6, and MyD88, carvacrol had good docking activity with TNF, and p-cymene had good docking activity with ALB. This study clarified the mechanism of action of oregano essential oil in the treatment of bovine mastitis, thus providing data supporting the potential for the use of oregano essential oil in the development of new therapeutics for bovine mastitis."

      "abstract": "Although the conventional therapy against dermatophytosis is based on antifungal drugs and environmental disinfection, the emergence of itraconazole(ITZ)-resistant dermatophytes has encouraged the search for active compounds, such as Origanum vulgare L. (oregano) essential oil (EO). However, little is known about its effect in polar extracts or the mechanism of action of these extracts and EO. We investigated the antifungal activity of four polar extracts and one EO from oregano against ITZ-susceptible and ITZ-resistant dermatophytes and their action mechanism. Polar extracts were prepared as infusions at 10 (INF10) and 60 (INF60) minutes, decoction (DEC) and hydroalcoholic extract (HAE); EO was purchased. All extracts and itraconazole were tested against Microsporum gypseum, M. canis, M. nanum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. verrucosum isolated from cats, dogs and cattle (n = 28), and humans (n = 2) (M38-A2, CLSI). Among polar extract, DEC stood out as antifungal, followed by INF10 and INF60; HAE was little active. For EO, all isolates were susceptible, including ITZ-resistant dermatophytes. EO was selected for action mechanism assays, and acted in cell wall and plasmatic membrane by complexing with fungal ergosterol. By chromatographic analysis, 4-hydroxibenzoic acid was the most prevalent compound in all polar extracts, followed by syringic acid and caffeic acid; luteolin was present only in HAE. For EO, carvacrol was the major compound (73.9%); followed by γ-terpinene (3.6%) and thymol (3.0%). These findings showed that the extract type of oregano has influenced the antifungal action on dermatophytes, highlight EO and DEC, that are promising as antifungal agent, including against ITZ-resistant dermatophytes.",

      "abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most prevalent vaginal infectious diseases. The increasing incidence of drug-resistant Candida strains and the limited therapeutic options make the discovery of effective alternative therapies fundamental. Essential oils (EOs) have been suggested as a promising alternative, and interestingly, vapor-phase essential oils (VP-EOs) present more advantages than their direct application. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of oregano VP-EO (VP-OEO) on biofilms of antifungal-resistant vaginal isolates of Candida species (Candida albicans and Candida glabrata) and determine its mode of action. CFU, membrane integrity, and metabolic activity were evaluated. Furthermore, a reconstituted vaginal epithelium was used to mimic vaginal conditions and evaluate the effect of VP-OEO on Candida species infection, analyzed by DNA quantification, microscopy, and lactate dehydrogenase activity. The results revealed high VP-OEO antifungal activity. There was a significant reduction (>4 log CFU) in Candida species biofilms. Furthermore, the results show that the mechanisms of action of VP-OEO are related to membrane integrity and metabolic activity. The epithelium model confirms the effectiveness of VP-OEO. This study suggests that VP-EO can be considered a first approach for the development of an alternative form of VVC treatment. IMPORTANCE This work presents a new approach to the application of essential oils, exposure to the vapor phase, which can be considered a first approach for the development of a complementary or alternative form of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) treatment. VVC is a significant infection caused by Candida species and remains a common disease that affects millions of women every year. The great difficulty in treating VVC and the extremely limited effective therapeutic options make the development of alternative treatments crucial. In this scope, this study aims to contribute to the development of effective, inexpensive, and nontoxic strategies for the prevention and treatment of this infectious disease, based on natural products. Moreover, this new approach has several advantages for women, such as lower costs, easy access, an easier mode of application, avoidance of skin contact, and, therefore, fewer negative impacts on women's health."

H. pylori eradication therapy consists of two to three antimicrobial medicinal products, but they exhibit limited efficacy and may cause adverse side effects. Alternative therapies are urgent. It was assumed that an essential oil mixture, obtained from species from genera Satureja L., Origanum L. and Thymus L. and called the HerbELICO® essential oil mixture, could be useful in H. pylori infection treatment. HerbELICO® was analyzed by GC-MS and assessed in vitro against twenty H. pylori clinical strains isolated from patients of different geographical origins and with different antimicrobial medicinal products resistance profiles, and for its ability to penetrate the artificial mucin barrier. A customer case study included 15 users of HerbELICO®liquid/HerbELICO®solid dietary supplements (capsulated HerbELICO® mixture in liquid/solid form). Carvacrol and thymol were the most dominant compounds (47.44% and 11.62%, respectively), together with p-cymene (13.35%) and γ-terpinene (18.20%). The minimum concentration required to inhibit in vitro H. pylori growth by HerbELICO® was 4-5% (v/v); 10 min exposure to HerbELICO® was enough to kill off the examined H. pylori strains, while HerbELICO® was able to penetrate through mucin. A high eradication rate (up to 90%) and acceptance by consumers was observed.",

Based on the general emulsion materials of ovalbumin (OVA) and inulin (IN), the addition of Lys and OEO successfully inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus, two representatives of which were Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria respectively. The emulsion system in this study was designed to compensate for the limitation that Lys could only act on Gram-positive bacteria, and the stability of the emulsion was improved using ultrasonic treatment. The optimal amounts among OVA, Lys and OEO were found to be the mass ratio of 1:1 (Lys to OVA) and 20% (w/w) OEO. The ultrasonic treatment at the power of 200, 400, 600, and 800 W and time length of 10 min improved the stability of emulsion, in which the surface tension was below 6.04 mN/m and the Turbiscan stability index (TSI) did not exceed 10. The multiple light scattering showed that sonicated emulsions were less prone to delamination; salt stability and pH stability of emulsions were improved, CLSM image showed emulsion as oil-in-water type. In the meantime, the particles of the emulsions were found to become smaller and more uniform with ultrasonic treatment. The best dispersion and stability of the emulsion were both achieved at 600 W with a zeta potential of 7.7 mV, the smallest particle size and the most uniform particle distribution.",

In the challenge-protection experiment, commercial Hongguang-Black 1-day-old breeder chicks were randomly divided into four groups, including A (challenged, preventive dose), B (challenged, treatment dose), C (challenged, untreated), and D (unchallenged, untreated). Group A was supplemented with 200 μL/L OEO in the drinking water during the whole trial (1-35 days of age) and group B was supplemented with 400 μL/L OEO during 8-12 days of age, while groups C and D were kept as untreated controls. At 7 days of age, birds of groups A, B, and C were divided into two subgroups with equal number of birds (A1-A2, B1-B2, and C1-C2), and then subgroups A1, B1, and C1 were challenged with SP, while subgroups A2, B2, and C2 were challenged with SG. Clinical symptoms and death were observed and recorded daily. Every week during the experiment, serum antibodies against SP and SG of all the groups were detected by the plate agglutinate test (PAT). At the age of 35 days, all birds were weighed and necropsied, lesions were recorded and the challenging pathogens were isolated. The results showed that the positive rates of SP and SG isolation in groups A1, A2 and B1, B2 were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of groups C1 and C2, respectively, while groups A1 and A2 were slightly lower (P > 0.05) than those of groups B1 and B2. The average body weight (BW) of groups A1 and A2 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of groups B1, B2 and C1, C2, respectively, but there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) with that of group D. The r-value between PAT positive and the recovery rates of Salmonella was 0.99, which means they are highly positively correlated. The results of this study demonstrated that the prevention dose (200μL/L) and the treatment dose (400 μL/L) of OEO supplemented in the drinking water could all effectively decrease infections of SP and SG and that the effect of the prevention was greater than that of the treatment and finally that the prevention could also significantly reduce the BW decline of birds challenged with SP and SG."

It was expressed in a fourfold reduction in the effective concentration of gentamicin and 98% inhibition of the bacterial metabolic activity. When ciprofloxacin was included in the combination instead of gentamicin, an additive effect with a two-fold decrease in the effective drug concentration and a 96% reduction in the bacterial metabolic activity were observed. Both combinations significantly inhibited the formation of MRSA biofilm by more than 90% when applied.

Seven dietary treatments were used: a negative control group (basal diet), a positive control group with ZnO (3000 mg/Kg of feed), two groups with OEO at 0.4% and 1.2% respectively, two groups with PGP at 0.4% and 2% respectively and one group with OEO at 1.2% combined with PGP at 2%. Only the positive control group received ZnO in the diet. Each group of piglets received the treatment for seven weeks, from weaning, and were later sacrificed to obtain jejunum and ileum samples for counting of goblet cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and IgA-producing cells. The growth performance were measured at the beginning and at the end of the seven weeks. In jejunum and ileum, the number of goblet cells increased in the groups with ZnO, PGP 2%, OEO 1.2% and PGP 2% + OEO 1.2%, presenting significant differences with the rest of the groups. The results obtained for the intraepithelial lymphocyte count were in line with those obtained for the count of goblet cells.

Regarding the growth performance, PGP 2%, OEO 1.2% and their combination had similar results to ZnO. The intestinal health of piglets could be improved, without harming the growth performance, by means of the supplementation of PGP 2%, OEO 1.2% and PGP 2% + OEO 1.2% offering a natural alternative to the use of ZnO.",

Here, a nanoemulgel fabricated with oregano essential oil nanoemulsion, assisted by low-level laser therapy, was investigated for its efficacy in diabetic wound healing. A hydrogel- based healing patch, fabricated using biological polymers namely chitosan and gelatin and, polyvinyl pyrollidone. The hydrogel was reinforced with cellulose nanofibrils for enhanced stability and barrier properties. Nanoemulsion of oregano essential oil, with an average particle size of 293.7 ± 8.3 nm, was prepared via homogenization with chitosan as the coating agent. Nanoemulsion impregnated hydrogel, termed as the nanoemulgel, was assessed for its physio-mechanical properties and healing efficiency. The strong linkages in nanoemulgel demonstrated its large swelling capacity, high mechanical strength, and maximum thermal stability. The optimized conditions for low-level laser therapy using 808 nm were 1 W. cm-2 and 5 min. The optimized drug concentration of 128 μg. mL-1 exhibited viability of NIH/3 T3 fibroblasts as 75.5 ± 1.2 % after 24 h. Cell migration assay demonstrated that dual therapy facilitated wound healing, with a maximum closure rate of 100 % at 48 h. In vivo results revealed the rapid healing effects of the dual therapy in diabetic rat models with foot ulcers: a maximum healing rate of 97.5 %, minimum scar formation, increased granulation, enhanced reepithelialization, and a drastic decrease in inflammation and neutrophil infiltration within the treatment period compared to monotherapy and control. In summary, the combinatorial therapy of nanoemulgel and low-level laser therapy is a promising regimen for managing diabetic foot ulcers with a rapid healing effect.",

      "abstract": "Clinical endometritis causes serious economic losses in dairy farms, mainly due to its negative health impact on fertility and milk production, as well as the additional costs of medicines used to treat the affected animals. The therapy for uterine diseases is principally performed with antibiotic treatment; however, its indiscriminate use in dairy herds can favor the increase in the resistance of pathogenic bacteria, leading to treatment failures. In this regard, the use of unconventional treatment may be a good option to reduce the use of antimicrobials in milk production. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of cinnamon, oregano, and thyme essential oils, and their combinations, against bovine uterine pathogens. The antibacterial activities of these essential oils were evaluated by the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), and Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) indices against Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes, which were isolated from dairy cows with clinical endometritis. Among the essential oils evaluated, the lowest MIC and MBC values observed were obtained with cinnamon essential oil alone. The association among essential oils showed different kinds of interactions, and in some situations, antagonism was observed. This study demonstrated a promising antimicrobial activity of cinnamon's essential oil, indicating that it has excellent potential to be explored as a possible alternative in the treatment of clinical endometritis in dairy cows.",

Reported infection rates soar up to 65% as the recalcitrant nature of biofilms complicates treatment. There is persistent need for therapies to manage biofilm burden. In response, we formulated and tested oregano essential oil in a topical gel as a potential biofilm management therapy. We developed an ex vivo system based on an established ovine OI implant model with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 biofilms as initial inocula. Gel was administered to the samples across a period of five days. Samples were quantified and colony forming unit (CFU) counts were compared against a positive control (initial bacterial inocula without treatment). Significant biofilm reduction was observed in samples treated with oregano gel compared to controls, demonstrating the potential of an oregano oil-based gel as a biofilm management therapy at the skin-implant interface of percutaneous OI implants."

Six hundred day-old Cobb 500 hybrid chickens were randomized into four dietary treatment groups with three replicates each. Chicks in the control group (C) received a basal diet, while the experimental treatment groups received basal diets containing 350 mg/kg of thyme oil (T1), 350 mg/kg of oregano oil (T2), and 350 mg/kg of thyme and oregano oil (T3). Growth performance parameters were evaluated at 14, 28, and 42 days. The broilers in treatments T1 and T2 had significantly higher body weights than the control group. The feed conversion ratio was the lowest in chicks who received oregano oil, followed by those fed thyme oil. The overall prevalence of growth-related breast muscle abnormalities (including white striping and white striping combined with wooden breast) in groups receiving essential oils (T1, T2, and T3) was significantly higher than in the control group (C). The thyme and oregano oil diets showed no significant differences in antibody titers against Newcastle disease or interferon-γ (INF-γ) serum levels. In conclusion, thyme and oregano oils had a positive impact on the growth performance of broiler chickens but increased the incidence of growth-related breast muscle abnormalities."

      "abstract": "Mosquito management programs in the urban environment of Italian cities mainly rely on larval control with conventional insecticides, primarily targeting the road drains that constitute the principal mosquito breeding sites encountered in public. The repeated utilization of synthetic insecticides may have adverse effects on non-targets and lead to resistance development issues, while the performance of biopesticides encounters limitations in field use. Botanical insecticides as single larval control agents or in binary mixtures with conventional insecticides have been extensively studied in the laboratory as an effective and eco-friendly alternative mosquito control method with promising results. The study herein concerns the investigation, for the first time under realistic conditions in the field, of the joint action of a carvacrol-rich oregano Essential Oil (EO) with two conventional insecticides, namely, the insect growth regulator diflubenzuron and the bio-insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (B.t.i.), in road drains in Crevalcore city, Italy, against Culex pipiens and Aedes albopictus. According to the obtained results, the application of both plain EO and its mixtures with diflubenzuron and B.t.i. exerted very high efficacy in terms of immature mosquito population reduction over a two-week period. Three weeks after treatment, the performance of the oil and its mixtures diminished but remained high, while the addition of diflubenzuron potentiated the persistent action of the oil against Cx. pipiens. These findings are indicative of the potential of mixing carvacrol-rich EO with diflubenzuron and B.t.i. as an efficient eco-friendly alternative to mono-insecticide applications in road drains against Cx. pipiens and Ae. albopictus larvae."

Herein, we investigated the chemical composition of hexane extract from Origanum vulgare (O. vulgare) leaves as well as its possible protective effects against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced HE in rats. GC-MS analysis of the extract revealed tentative identification of twenty-five compounds (82.93%), predominated by cholesten-3-one (27.30%), followed by γ-tocopherol (13.52%), α-tocopherol (5.01%), β-amyrin (5.24%) and α-amyrin (4.89%). Albino rats were distributed into seven groups (n = 7). G1 served as negative control; G2 and G3 served as controls treated with O. vulgare (100 and 200 mg/kg/p.o b.w, respectively); G4 served as TAA-positive control group (100 mg/kg/day/i.p., three alternative days per week for six weeks); G5, G6, and G7 served as TAA -induced HE rat model that received O. vulgare 100, O. vulgare 200, and silymarin (100 mg/kg of SILY, as standard drug), respectively. TAA showed depressive and anxiety-like behaviors in forced swimming test (FST) and reduction of cognitive score in elevated plus-maze test (EPMT) as well as impairment of locomotor and exploratory activities in open-field test (OFT). TAA caused a significant decline in body weight gain; however, the relative liver weight and brain water content were statistically increased. TAA-intoxicated rats showed significant increase of serum biomarker enzymes, proinflammatory cytokines, blood ammonia levels, brain serotonin, acetyl cholinesterase and cellular lipid peroxidation with significant decrease of brain dopamine, norepinephrine, antioxidant status. The hepatoprotective/neuro-protective activities of O. vulgare was found to be comparable with that of SILY in HE rats model. Where, treatment of TAA-intoxicated rats with O. vulgare attenuated anxiety, depressive-related behaviors, and reduced the biochemical changes in HE-induced by TAA. Therefore, O. vulgare could be an excellent hepato-/neuroprotective against hepatic injury and HE via improving the oxidative/inflammatory status through its antioxidant and neuro-modulatory properties and its effect is equal to that of SILY.",

      "abstract": "Mosquito management programs rely basically on the use of conventional synthetic larvicides. However, frequent applications and misuse of some synthetic insecticides have led to problems related to mosquito resistance development, harmful effects on human health and unacceptable environmental effects on non-target organisms. Recently, a growing number of phytochemicals has been tested as more eco-friendly larvicides against various mosquito species, exerting high efficacy with multiple modes of action. In the laboratory, we investigated for the first time the sublethal effects of oregano oil and its major compound carvacrol, against Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito), a mosquito of great medical importance. We determined the effects of short term (24h) exposure of 3rd- 4th larvae to LC50 concentrations on survival and development of survived larvae until adulthood, as well as on fecundity, fertility, longevity and wing length of emerged adults. Only half of 24h survived larvae from oregano oil and carvacrol treatment finally reached adulthood. Abnormal shapes of dead larvae and pupae, and failed adult emergence were also observed, indicating a potential growth inhibitory activity of the tested materials. No particular effects from exposure to larvicidal LC50 concentrations were recorded on life cycle parameters of successfully emerged adults. These findings suggest the tested oregano oil and carvacrol as sufficiently effective larvicides against Ae. albopictus at lower than the acutely toxic concentrations, promoting a more eco-friendly and less costly profile for these biopesticides.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is alarmingly rising and sustainable therapy/prevention is needed. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of oregano or Origanum vulgare (O. vulgare) essence (OE) on the PCOS rat model system. Vaginal smears monitored the estrous cycle of 40 virgin adult rats, and they received 2 mg estradiol valerate (EV)/0.2 ml corn oil intramuscularly to induce PCOS. At 60 days post-EV injection, all rats were evaluated for follicular development/cysts. The EV-induced PCOS rats were orally administered 250 and 500 mg/kgBW/day of OE for 30 days. OE was also further assessed for its predominant components along with hormonal, histological, and inflammatory-related gene expressions in the ovaries. The main components of the OE were predominantly pulegone (36.3), L-menthone (31.3%), far less piperitone (7.8%), isopiperitone (6.4%), isomenthol (3.6%), humulene epoxide II (2.2%), α-pinene (1.7%), and thymol (1.5%). Hormonal, histological, and inflammatory-related gene expression results showed >4-fold and 1.5-fold increase in FSH and progesterone; ∼50%, 85%, 45%, 55%, and 30% decreased in LH, estradiol, estrogen, testosterone, and AMH; and dose-dependently decreased in mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1α, NF-kB, TNF-α, and IL-1β by 25-65%, 55-75%, 15-40%, 30-55%, and 35-55%, respectively, and thus decreased the severity of PCOS, boosted endocrine balance, restored functional follicles and corpus luteum, and thus ovulation in PCOS rats. Overall, in the disrupted PCOS rats, OE oral treatment effectively relieved estradiol-induced PCOS rats via: (1) its endocrine balancing on GnRH, FSH, and LH and (2) its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties on ovary caused by OE's useful compounds like pulegone, thymol, and L-menthone. Though many aspects of the effects remain to be tested, such an underlying mechanistic reproductive regulatory effect observed in OE-administered rats further proves its sensible pharmaceutical applications in reproductive medicine and more specifically, PCOS."

In recent years, extracts of oregano oil and macleaya cordata have become a hot spot in the research and application of AGP substitutes for their safety and high efficiency. This study is the first to report the effect of oregano oil combined with macleaya cordata oral solution on broiler growth performance. A total of 960 one-day-old broiler chickens were randomly divided into four treatment groups (240 chickens per group). Each treatment group was divided into six replicate groups (40 birds per replicate group). There were four groups in this study: the solvent control group, the oregano essential oil combined with macleaya cordata extract oral solution group (OS group), the oregano essential oil oral solution group (OEO group), and the macleaya cordata extract oral solution group (MCE group). Two chickens from each replicate group were collected and mixed into a composite sample. Six composite samples were obtained for each treatment group. The results showed that the oregano oil combined with macleaya cordata oral solution significantly improved the growth performance of broiler chickens. At the same time, serum biochemical indices, serum antioxidant indices, serum immune indices, serum cytokines, and intestinal morphology were significantly improved by the OS group. This study shows that oregano oil combined with macleaya cordata oral solution has substantial potential to be an alternative to AGPs for broilers."

      "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a neglected vector-borne disease; there are different manifestations of the diseases and species involved, and cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (L.) mexicana is the most prevalent in Mexico. Currently, the drugs available for the treatment of leishmaniasis are toxic, expensive, and often ineffective; therefore, it is imperative to carry out research and development of new therapeutic alternatives, with natural products being an attractive option. In particular, oregano is a plant with worldwide distribution; in Mexico, two species: Lippia berlandieri Schauer and Poliomintha longiflora Gray are endemic. Both essential oils (EO's) have been reported to have antimicrobial activity attributed to their main components, thymol and carvacrol. In this research, the leishmanicidal effect and mechanism of cell death induced by L. berlandieri EO, P. longiflora EO, thymol, and carvacrol in L. mexicana promastigotes were determined in vitro. Additionally, the cytotoxic activity in mammalian cells was evaluated. L. berlandieri EO presented higher leishmanicidal activity (IC50 = 41.78 µg/mL) than P. longiflora EO (IC50 = 77.90 µg/mL). Thymol and carvacrol were the major components of both Mexican oregano EO's. Thymol presented higher leishmanial inhibitory activity (IC50 = 22.39 µg/mL), above that of carvacrol (IC50 = 61.52 µg/mL). All the EO's and compounds evaluated presented lower cytotoxic activity than the reference drug; thymol was the compound with the best selectivity index (SI). In all cases, apoptosis was identified as the main mechanism of death induced in the parasites. The leishmanicidal capacity of the Mexican oregano EO is an accessible and affordable alternative that can be further explored.",

Enterococcus faecalis is a foodborne opportunistic pathogen that can be found in nature and the food processing industry. The goal of this investigation was to explore the antimicrobial action and mechanism of OEO against E. faecalis, inactivation action of OEO on E. faecalis in mature biofilms, and its application in chicken breast. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OEO against E. faecalis strains (ATCC 29212 and nine isolates) ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 μL/mL. OEO therapy reduced intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, caused cell membrane hyperpolarization, increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and elevated extracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. Furthermore, OEO treatment diminished cell membrane integrity and caused morphological alterations in the cells. In biofilms on stainless-steel, OEO showed effective inactivation activity against E. faecalis. OEO reduced the number of viable cells, cell viability and exopolysaccharides in the biofilm, as well as destroying its structure. Application of OEO on chicken breast results in a considerable reduction in E. faecalis counts and pH values, in comparison to control samples. These findings suggest that OEO could be utilized as a natural antibacterial preservative and could effectively control E. faecalis in food manufacturing."

      "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for causing 6,218,308 deaths globally till date and has garnered worldwide attention. The lack of effective preventive and therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2 has further worsened the scenario and has bolstered research in the area. The N-terminal and C-terminal RNA binding domains (NTD and CTD) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein represent attractive therapeutic drug targets. Naturally occurring compounds are an excellent source of novel drug candidates due to their structural diversity and safety. Ten major bioactive compounds were identified in ethanolic extract (s) of Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Cinnamomum tamala, Origanum vulgare, and Petroselinum crispum using HPLC and their cytotoxic potential was determined against cancer and normal cell lines by MTT assay to ascertain their biological activity in vitro. To evaluate their antiviral potential, the binding efficacy to NTD and CTD of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was determined using in silico biology tools. In silico assessment of the phytocomponents revealed that most of the phytoconstituents displayed a druglike character with no predicted toxicity. Binding affinities were in the order apigenin > catechin > apiin toward SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid NTD. Toward nucleocapsid CTD, the affinity decreased as apigenin > cinnamic acid > catechin. Remdesivir displayed lesser affinity with NTD and CTD of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins than any of the studied phytoconstituents. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results revealed that throughout the 100 ns simulation, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein NTD-apigenin complex displayed greater stability than SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein NTD-cinnamic acid complex. Hence, apigenin, catechin, apiin and cinnamic acid might prove as effective prophylactic and therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2, if examined further in vitro and in vivo. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Ten major bioactive compounds were identified in the extract(s) of four medicinally important plants viz. Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Cinnamomum tamala, Origanum vulgare and Petroselinum crispum using HPLC and their biological activity was also evaluated against cancer and normal cell lines. Interestingly, while all extract(s) wielded significant cytotoxicity against cancer cells, no significant toxicity was found against normal cells. The outcome of the results prompted evaluation of the antiviral potential of the ten bioactive compounds using in silico biology tools. The present study emphasizes on the application of computational approaches to understand the binding interaction and efficacy of the ten bioactive compounds from the above plants with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal and C-terminal RNA binding domains in preventing and/or treating COVID-19 using in silico tools. Druglikeness and toxicity profiles of the compounds were carried out to check the therapeutic application of the components. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to check the stability of ligand-protein complexes. The results provided useful insights into the structural binding interaction(s) that can be exploited for the further development of potential antiviral agents targeting SARS-CoV-2 especially since no specific therapy is still available to combat the rapidly evolving virus and the existing treatment is more or less symptomatic which makes search for novel antiviral agents all the more necessary and crucial.",

      "abstract": "This study was performed to determine the early-life (first month of age) supplementation of liquid feed with fennel seed powder (FSP) or oregano leaf powder (OLP) on growth performance, health, and blood biochemical attributes in preweaning dairy calves. Holstein female calves (n = 57; 1 d of age; 34.1 ± 0.97 kg of BW; mean ± SE) were assigned randomly to receive liquid feed (colostrum and milk) with no added herbal plants (CON) or supplemented with FSP (3 g/d) or OLP (30 g/d) during the first month of age. The calves received pooled colostrum (4.5 kg/d on the first 2 d of life; total solids = 25.0% ± 1.24; mean ± SD) and then pooled waste milk (6 kg/d from d 3 to 44, 5 kg/d from d 45 to 46, 4 kg/d from d 47 to 48, and 3 kg/d from d 49 to 50 of the trial; total solids = 12.54% ± 0.50) to ensure they receive same mixed liquid feed daily. The calves had unlimited access to the starter feed and fresh water and remained in the study until weaning on d 51 of age. The average mean temperature-humidity index was 70.1 units (ranging between 61.9 to 78.2) during the experiment, indicating a borderline degree of environmental heat-load. The amount of starter feed offered and refused was recorded daily. The calves were weighed immediately after birth and every 10 d thereafter, before the morning feeding. Jugular blood samples were taken immediately before and 24 h after colostrum feeding, at first month of age, and at weaning to quantify serum concentrations of glucose, urea N, cholesterol, triglycerides, total proteins, albumin, globulin, aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, total antioxidant status, and malondialdehyde. Health checks including rectal temperature, general appearance (on a 1-5 score system), fecal score (on a 1-5 score system), and bovine respiratory disease (BRD; scored using the University of Wisconsin Calf Health Chart) were performed daily, by a veterinarian who was unaware of the calf treatment allocations, for all calves over the study period. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare growth performance and blood metabolites among treatment groups, and a logistic regression model using a binomial distribution (PROC GLIMMIX, SAS v. 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.) was used to assess the chance of elevated rectal temperature (≥39.4°C), general appearance (≥2), diarrhea (≥3), and BRD. A Poisson regression model (PROC GENMOD) was also used to test group differences in the experience of days with elevated rectal temperature and general appearance, and frequency and duration of diarrhea or BRD. Total nutrient intake (DM, CP, and ME, but not ether extract) originating from milk and starter feed was greater in OLP- (but not FSP-) supplemented calves compared with CON group, being partially associated with difference in milk refusal. Calves receiving FSP and OLP had greater average daily gain, BW gain, skeletal gain (withers height or heart girth, respectively), and feed efficiency compared with CON animals with no difference between FSP and OLP. Rectal temperature was lower in FSP- (but not OLP-) supplemented calves compared with CON animals. The CON animals had a greater chance of experiencing higher rectal temperature (≥39.4°C; odds ratio = 1.55 and confidence interval = 1.12-2.15 and odds ratio = 1.33 and confidence interval = 0.92-1.90, respectively, compared with FSP and OLP) and general appearance (≥2; odds ratio = 1.99 and confidence interval = 1.45-2.74 and odds ratio = 1.45 and confidence interval = 1.03-2.05), and diarrhea (odds ratio = 1.47 and confidence interval = 1.11-1.97 and odds ratio = 1.49 and confidence interval = 1.07-2.08) compared with those receiving FSP or OLP; with the chance of BRD being lower in FSP- (but not OLP-) supplemented versus CON animals (odds ratio = 1.59 and confidence interval = 1.13-2.23). As compared with OLP and CON groups, FSP treatment resulted in shorter days with elevated rectal temperature and general appearance. Supplementing FSP or OLP decreased the duration of diarrhea and BRD but not their frequency compared with CON. Duration of diarrhea was not different between FSP- or OLP-supplemented calves but calves supplemented with FSP had shorter days with BRD compared with OLP-supplemented calves. Of the blood constituents measured on d 30, concentration of aspartate transferase was higher in FSP- (but not CON) versus OLP-supplemented calves, indicating a transient liver tissue damage or dysfunction which was subsequently ameliorated. At weaning, blood concentration of triglycerides was higher in FSP and OLP groups compared with CON group. Supplementation of the liquid feed with FSP or OLP, especially FSP, had beneficial effects on calf growth performance and health. Further experiments are warranted for optimizing the dosage and duration of feeding FSP or OLP as feed additives for dairy calves.",

OSEA contained higher levels of gallic acid, syringic acid, protocatechuic acid, and catechin than OSE. OSEA inhibited lipid droplet accumulation with concentration dependent manner in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes during differentiation. OSEA showed more inhibition ability than OSE by 13.7-fold at the level of 125 μg/mL. Additionally, relative mRNA and protein expression levels of pparγ, c/ebpα, fas, and srebp-1c which are related to adipogenesis were significantly lower in OSEA treatment group than in OSE treatment group (p < 0.05). Therefore, OSEA could be used as anti-obesity functional ingredient."

This was the first report where oregano essential oil-based nano emulsion (OENE) was synthesized for studying its effects on prostate cancer cell lines (PC3). At first, we have synthesized OENE and characterized using various spectroscopic analyses. The toxicity and inhibitory concentration (IC50) of OENE toward prostate cancer by MTT analysis were performed. The lipid biogenesis mediated, molecular target pathway analyses were performed using fluorescence cellular staining techniques, real-time RT-PCR, or western blotting analysis. OENE showed IC50 at 13.82 µg/mL and significantly induced distinct morphological changes, including cell shrinkage, cell density, and cell shape reduction. In addition, OENE could also significantly decreased lipid droplet accumulation which was confirmed by studying mRNA transcripts of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) (0.31-fold), fatty acid synthase (FASN) (0.18-fold), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREPB1) (0.11-fold), respectively. Furthermore, there is a significant upregulation BAX (BCL2 associated X) and caspase 3 expressions. Nevertheless, OENE decreased the transcript level of BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), thus resulting in apoptosis. Overall, our present work demonstrated that OENE could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer and warrants in vivo studies."

      "abstract": "Blue light (BL) at 405 nm and oregano essential oil (OEO) have shown bactericidal activity by its own. Here, we demonstrated that the two synergistically killed multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). Pa ATCC19660 and HS0065 planktonic cells and mature biofilms were reduced by more than 7 log10 after treatment by BL combined with OEO, in sharp contrast to no significant bacterial reduction with the monotreatment. The duo also sufficiently eliminated acute or biofilm-associated infection of open burn wounds in murine without incurring any harmful events in the skin. The synergic bactericide was attributed mainly to the ability of OEO to magnify cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production initiated by BL that excited endogenous tetrapyrrole macrocycles in bacteria while completely sparing the surrounding tissues from the phototoxic action. OEO ingredient analysis in combination with microbial assays identified carvacrol and its isomer thymol to be the major phytochemicals that cooperated with BL executing synergic killing. The finding argues persuasively for valuable references of carvacrol and thymol in assessing and standardizing the bactericidal potential of various OEO products."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is considered as a major postharvest disease affecting many fruits. This plant disease is traditionally managed with synthetic fungicides, which are generally toxic and are linked to pathogen resistance. Recently, microencapsulated bioactives have been developed as potential alternative strategies to these methods, while utilizing natural fungicides and other phytochemicals. Wild oregano, Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour.) Spreng, contains potent antimicrobial phenolics, but these compounds are volatile and relatively unstable, which limits their efficacy during application. Herein, a baker's yeast microencapsulation system was applied to improve the stability of wild oregano phenolic extract (WOPE) and enhance its antifungal activity against anthracnose. RESULTS: Encapsulation of WOPE in plasmolyzed yeast cells afforded a high encapsulation efficiency (93%) and yielded WOPE-loaded yeast microcapsules (WLYMs) with an average diameter of 2.65 μm. Storage stability studies showed WLYMs are stable for at least 4 months. A 24  -h in vitro release experiment showed that WLYMs had an initial burst release upon redispersion in water, followed by a controlled release to about 80% of the loaded WOPE. Upon application as a spray-type postharvest treatment for papaya, WLYMs exhibited a significantly improved mycelial inhibitory action against C. gloeosporioides and greatly reduced the anthracnose symptoms in papaya fruits. CONCLUSION: This study presented a yeast microencapsulation system that can effectively stabilize WOPE and enhance its antifungal activity, making this microparticle formulation a promising environmentally safe postharvest treatment option to combat anthracnose symptoms in papaya fruits. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect and germicidal activity of OEO on V. vulnificus and its possible inhibition mechanism. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of OEO against four V. vulnificus strains (ATCC 27562 and three isolates from seafoods) were from 0.06 to 0.15 μL/mL. Compared with untreated bacteria, OEO reduced the concentration of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), hyperpolarized the cell membrane, increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased the concentration of intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA), but there was no obvious DNA damage at the OEO test concentration. It was indicated that OEO inactivated V. vulnificus by generating ROS which caused lipid peroxidation of cell membranes, thereby reducing the permeability and integrity of cell membranes and causing morphological changes to cells, but there was no obvious damage to DNA. In addition, OEO could effectively kill V. vulnificus in oysters at 25 °C, and the number of bacteria decreased by 48.2% after 0.09% OEO treatment for 10 h. The good inhibitory effect and bactericidal activity of OEO showed in this study, and the economy and security of OEO make it possible to apply OEO to control V. vulnificus contamination in oysters and other seafoods."

Therefore, the current study aimed to develop nano-cubosomes loaded with finasteride (FI) and oregano oil (Or) to improve drug solubility and permeation through skin and then incorporate it into an aloe ferox gel base. An l-optimal coordinate exchange design was adopted to optimize nano-cubosomes. Phytantriol and Alkyl Acrylate were employed as the lipid material, and surfactant respectively for cubosomes manufacture. The produced formulations were assessed for their particle size, entrapment efficiency (EE%), FI steady-state flux (Jss) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Pro-pionibacterium acnes. Optimal FI-Or-NCu had a particle size of 135 nm, EE% equals 70%, Jss of 1.85 μg/cm2.h, and MIC of 0.44 μg/ml. The optimum formulation loaded gel gained the highest drug release percent and ex vivo skin permeation compared to FI aqueous suspension, and pure FI loaded gel. Aloe ferox and oregano oil in the optimized gel formulation had a synergistic activity on the FI permeation across the skin and against the growth of p. acne bacteria which could favor their use in treating alopecia. Thus, this investigation affirms the ability of FI-Or-NCu loaded aloe ferox gel could be an effective strategy that would enhance FI release and permeation through skin and maximize its favorable effects in treating alopecia.",

Six EOC levels (treatments: 0 mg·L-1, CON; 50 mg·L-1, EOC1; 100 mg·L-1, EOC2; 400 mg·L-1, EOC3; 800 mg·L-1, EOC4 and 1500 mg·L-1, EOC5) were selected to be used to in vitro incubation. The in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility (IVNDFD), in vitro acid detergent fiber digestibility (IVNDFD), pH, ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration, total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentration and microbial protein (MCP) concentration were measured after 48 h incubation, after which the groups with significant nutrient digestibility and fermentation parameters were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. The results showed that the total gas production (GP) of the EOC5 group was higher than that of the other groups after 12 h of in vitro incubation. TVFA, NH3-N and MCP concentrations were also shown to be higher in group EOC5 than those in other groups (p < 0.05), while NH3-N and MCP concentrations in the EOC2 group were lower than those in other groups significantly (p < 0.05). The molar ratio of acetic acid decreased while the molar ratio of propionic acid increased after the addition of EOC. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the rumen microbiota was altered in response to adding EOC, especially for the EOC5 treatment, with firmicutes shown to be the most abundant (43.1%). The relative abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group was significantly lower, while the relative abundance of uncultured_bacterium_f_Muribaculaceae and Succiniclasticum was significantly higher in the EOC5 group than those in other groups (p < 0.05). Comprehensive analysis showed that EOC (1500 mg·L-1) could significantly increase gas production, alter sheep rumen fermentation parameters and microbiota composition."

There is no significant (p > 0.05) in average daily feed intake, feed efficiency between NCNT and birds fed with combined THB and oregano extracts for the entire experimental period. A combination of THB and oregano extract regardless of concentration levels or THB alone reduced (p < 0.05) lesion score in ileum compared to the CNT diet for 7 days post-infection (dpi). Birds fed COM 100 diet had lower (p < 0.05) intestinal lesion scores in jejunum and caeca on 7 dpi compared to those were in the CNT diet. No (p > 0.05) difference was observed in the oocysts per gram of feces count, intestinal morphology, carcass traits and blood cytokine concentration among the infected treatments. Collectively, we conclude that birds fed with a combination of THB and oregano extracts regardless of the ratios that were used demonstrated better recovery of health after the coccidial challenge than using only THB alone."

      "abstract": "Oregano essential oil (OEO), as a natural antimicrobial, has gained increased interest from food researchers and manufacturers. However, a few studies have investigated its possible antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus using the proteomic tool. The present study aimed to explore the antibacterial effect and mechanism of a carvacrol-rich OEO extracted from Origanum vulgare \"Hot & Spicy\" on the inactivation of S. aureus. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the OEO allowed the detection of 27 compounds; the major constituent was carvacrol (84.38% of total compounds). The average diameter of the inhibitory zone (DIZ) value was 29.10 mm, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of OEO against S. aureus were 0.125 and 0.25 mg/mL, respectively. The growth curve assay indicated that the OEO prolonged the lag phase of S. aureus. The decrease in cell viability, changes in the integrity of cell membrane, and abnormal cell morphology further reflected the cell damage of S. aureus caused by the OEO. In addition, a label-free proteomic analysis was applied to analyze the regulatory networks of S. aureus in response to 1/2 MIC OEO-treatment stress. Of the 56 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) identified, 26 were significantly upregulated and 30 downregulated. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the DEPs were mainly involved in pathways of ribosomes; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, which suggested that the growth inhibition of S. aureus might be due to the disordered effect of the OEO on protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism. These findings deepened our understanding regarding S. aureus survival and metabolism responses to the OEO treatment and suggested that the carvacrol-rich OEO could be used in food production environments to effectively control S. aureus."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to produce dog food containing natural antioxidants (blend of essential oils and vitamin E) to replace synthetic antioxidants and determine the effects on food conservation and animal health sequentially. The foods were produced in a commercial factory, and the antioxidants were added at the oil bath stage. Ten adult beagle dogs were used, divided into two treatments; control treatment (CON; synthetic antioxidant feed [butylhydroxytoluene]) and test treatment (NAT; natural antioxidant feed; blend of essential oils from clove, rosemary, oregano, and vitamin E). The dogs were weighed at the beginning and end of each experimental period, and there were no treatment effects for body weight. In both treatments, food conservation efficiency was observed, demonstrating the feasibility of using natural sources as antioxidants in dog food because chemical and oxidative variables did not differ regardless of the antioxidant used during production. The animals' metabolic and haematological variables were not influenced by the treatments; however, a reduction in the number of lymphocytes was observed over time only in the dogs of the NAT group. There was also a day effect for total leukocyte, neutrophil and erythrocyte counts only in NAT animals, which means a significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) in the variables on d 28. There was an effect of the treatment and an interaction treatment x day for the total bacterial count, whereas a decrease in the bacterial count (p < 0.05) was observed in NAT dogs' faeces on day 28. Dogs fed the NAT diet had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) (p ≤ 0.05) to minimise oxidative stress. In group NAT, the NPSH and glutathione S-transferase levels were increased, which may explain the decrease in ROS levels. It was concluded that natural antioxidants in dog feed, in addition to promoting feed conservation, stimulate levels of systemic antioxidants and minimise the impacts caused by free radicals in the dogs' blood.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Natural oil-based nanoemulsions (NEs) have been widely investigated in many diseases that affect the oral cavity. NEs are delivery systems that enhance the solubility of lipid therapeutics and improve their delivery to target sites; they are known as self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDSs). The current investigation's aim was to produce an oregano essential oil-based nanoemulsion (OEO-SNEDD) that would have antibacterial and antifungal effects against oral microbiota and improve oral health. METHODS: Several OEO-SNEDDSs were developed using different percentages of OEO (10%, 14%, and 18%), percentages of a surfactant mixture Pluracare L64:Lauroglycol FCC (18%, 32%, and 36%), Smix ratios (1:2, 1:1, and 2:1), and hydrophilic-lipophilic balances (HLBs) of the surfactant mixture (8, 10, and 12) using the Box‒Behnken design. The optimized concentration of excipients was determined using a pseudoternary phase diagram to obtain the NEs. The formulations were evaluated for their droplet size, stability index, and antibacterial and antifungal activities. RESULTS: The NEs had a droplet size of 150 to 500 nm and stability index of 47% to 95%, and the produced formulation reached antibacterial and antifungal inhibition zones of up to 19 and 17 mm, respectively. The Box‒Behnken design was adopted to get the optimum formulation, which was 18% OEO, 36% Smix, 10.29 HLB of Smix, and a 1.25:1 Smix ratio. The optimized formulation had a lower ulcer index compared with various other formulations evaluated in rats. CONCLUSION: This study illustrated that OEO-SNEDDSs can provide good protection against oral microbial infections.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty Barki lambs, 20 apparently healthy (control group) and, 40 suffered from bacterial enteritis [enteric group (EG)], were subdivided into four treated groups (TGs): antibiotic group (AG), antibiotic + A,D3,E group (A + A,D3,E), antibiotic + oregano oil (AOG), and oregano group (OG). Fecal swabs were collected from EG then aseptically cultured, isolated, phenotypically identified, genotypically confirmed, and sequenced by PCR 16srRNA. Paper disk diffusion test was used for estimation of oregano oil extract 15% antibacterial activity. After blood sample aspiration from all animals, they were clinicopathologically and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Escherichia coli, followed by Salmonella species and then Klebsiella species, was the main causative agents of lamb diarrhea and were susceptible to oregano oil extract 15%. A + A,D3,E and AOG showed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement of some clinicopathological parameters more than AG or OG. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), yielded area under the curve, sensitivity, negative predictive value as 1, 100% and 100% respectively, were determined in both EG and TGs. CONCLUSION: Oregano oil extract 15% has good antibacterial properties against enteric bacteria in vitro and in vivo. The combination between antibiotic and antioxidant vitamins or oregano plant extract of 15% has a good impact on some clinicopathological alterations in lamb bacterial enteritis treatment. TAC, MMP-9, and MMP-2 may be good markers for the disease and its treatment follow-up."

Results showed that the Weibull model was more suitable to describe the thermal inactivation behavior of S. montevideo CICC21588 in two kinds of tahini than the first-order model. Inactivation curves were concave-upward in undiluted tahini but concave-downward in diluted tahini. During storage of undiluted tahini, 3% oregano oil caused extra 1.44 or 0.80 log CFU/g reductions after 7 days at 25 °C or 4 °C compared to the control and 0.5% citric acid caused an extra reduction of 0.75 log CFU/g after 7 d at 4 °C. For diluted tahini, 2-3% oregano oil and 0.4-0.5% ε-polylysine reduced more populations compared to undiluted tahini. These antimicrobials all inhibited the growth of S. montevideo during 24 h at 25 °C and ε-polylysine had the best effect. Furthermore, these antimicrobials enhanced the Salmonella inactivation in diluted tahini during thermal treatment, and there was less of a synergistic effect of thermal and antimicrobials in undiluted tahini due to less sublethal injured cells caused by heat. This study may provide useful information for Salmonella inactivation in tahini."

The fatty acid composition was evaluated in meat after 0 and 9 days of storage. No variation in the fatty acid composition of each type of meat was observed after storage. The use of dietary linseed and vitamin E, compared with linseed alone, significantly improved the oxidative stability, lightness (L*), and redness (a*) of the meat. A higher degree of oxidation was observed in meat samples from animals in the group fed linseed (L) followed by the control group (C) and the group fed linseed and vitamin E (LE). Moreover, the essential oils treatment (O) exerts a significant effect on beef oxidative stability of the group LE more than groups C and L during storage. The fatty acid composition of the meat was also affected by the diet: levels of healthful fatty acids (PUFA, n-3 PUFA, and CLA) were higher in meat from the groups that received linseed than the control group. Our results suggest that dietary vitamin E and treatment with essential oils are effective approaches to preserving the stability of beef cattle receiving a diet enriched in unsaturated fatty acids for up to 9 days of storage."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of dietary supplementation with a mixture of dried oregano, thyme, sideritis tea and chamomile on laying hen performance, egg quality parameters, and oxidative stability in the egg yolk were monitored. METHODS: In this trial 432 hens were allocated in two treatments (unsupplemented vs. supplemented with the mixture) and fed for 42 days. Eggs were collected at the end of the trial period, egg yolk was separated, extracted, and the total phenolic content (TPC) and oxidative stability was measured. Furthermore, LC-MS metabolic profile of eggs was studied and pathway analysis was elaborated in MetaboAnalyst to facilitate annotation of features. RESULTS: Overall, egg production and feed conversion ratio were not affected by the supplementation. However, eggs from the supplemented treatment showed improved shell thickness and strength, and yolk resistance to oxidation. Moreover, LC-MS metabolomic analysis of egg yolk of supplemented and unsupplemented layers showed significant variations and tight clustering in unsupervised principal component analysis due to different chemical profiling of egg yolk. LC-MS study showed that secondary metabolites of aromatic plants did not transfer into yolk, nevertheless the feed supplementation impacted the pathway metabolism of tyrosine, phenylalanine, propanate, and the biosynthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary supplementation of layers with a mixture of dried medicinal aromatic plants affected shell thickness and strength, the lipid and protein oxidative stability and increased tyrosine and phenylalanine content in eggs.",

Hence, the development of new effective alternatives to antibiotics that do not hinder productivity is imperative. For this, the aim of the present study was to determine whether oregano essential oil (OEO) extracted from Lippia origanoides is a suitable alternative to growth-promoting antibiotics (GPAs) for improving the performance, egg quality, and intestinal morphometry of ISA Brown laying hens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ninety-six 70-week-old ISA Brown laying hens were randomly assigned to four treatment groups with four replicates per treatment and six hens per replicate. The treatments consisted of four different diets that were formulated according to the nutritional requirements of the genetic line and the production phase with and without the addition of GPA and OEO: NC, which did not contain OEO or GPA; GPA, which included 50 ppm zinc bacitracin as a GPA; 80OEO, which included 80 ppm OEO and no GPA; and 150OEO, which included 150 ppm OEO and no GPA. RESULTS: All of the OEO and GPA treatment groups had a better feed conversion ratio than the NC group. However, the addition of 150 ppm OEO to the diet improved the percentage egg production and egg mass, as well as the external and internal quality of the egg compared with the other treatments. In addition, both the 80OEO and 150OEO treatments improved the yolk color, shell thickness, and shell color, as well as parameters related to the intestinal morphometry compared with the NC group. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that 150 ppm OEO can be used as a substitute for GPA to improve the performance, egg quality, and parameters related to the intestinal morphometry of ISA Brown laying hens."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty noncarious, freshly extracted human permanent maxillary incisors without any visible defects were selected as samples. They were divided into three groups (n = 10) based on the antioxidant treatment received as follows: group I-10% sodium ascorbate solution, group II-10% green tea solution, and group III-5% oregano solution. 35% hydrogen peroxide was employed for bleaching. The wt% of teeth was calculated at three time intervals. The initial wt% was calculated prior to the bleaching procedure. The second one was calculated after subjecting to bleaching protocols, and final one was calculated after antioxidant treatment using EDAX. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in the calcium/phosphorus ratio for the bleached samples in comparison with the sound enamel. There was a comparable and significant increase in the calcium/phosphorus ratio values after application of the antioxidant with insignificant difference among the antioxidants evaluated in the study. CONCLUSION: Treatment with antioxidants helped in the reversal of mineral loss, which occurred due to the bleaching procedure while the efficacy of 10% oregano on reversal of the calcium and phosphorus ratio was found to comparable to that of 10% sodium ascorbate and green tea. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Application of antioxidants after bleaching reduced the time delay in performing the adhesive procedures without compromising their clinical efficacy.",

A total of nine hundred and sixty 1-d-old female Qingyuan partridge chickens were randomly allocated to four treatment groups with six replicates of 40 birds each, and the feeding trial was lasted for 30 d. The controls were fed on a basal diet without in-feed antibiotics; the birds in the antibiotic group were fed the basal diet supplemented with 20 mg/kg virginiamycin; the remaining birds were fed the basal diet containing 150 or 300 mg/kg OEO, respectively. Dietary supplementation with 150 or 300 mg/kg OEO increased average daily feed intake (P = 0.057) and average daily gain (P < 0.05). The activities of glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidative capacity in plasma, jejuna, and ileal mucosa were increased by OEO supplementation (P < 0.05), with a trend of lower jejunal content of malonaldehyde (P = 0.062). Moreover, dietary OEO increased the content of secretory immunoglobulin A (P = 0.078) and the relative expression of Claudin 1, Mucin 2, and Avain beta-defensin 1 in ileum (P < 0.05). Sequencing data of 16S rRNA indicated that dietary OEO increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes phylum, and Clostridium and Lactobacillus genera, and decreasing that of Romboutsia. Functional analyses indicated that microbial amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, replication, and repair systems were higher in OEO groups than those of controls and antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with OEO enhanced growth performance, alleviated local oxidative stress in intestine, improved production of natural antibodies, and favorably modulated intestinal microbiota composition.",

      "abstract": "Asparagopsis taxiformis (AT) is a source of multiple halogenated compounds and, in a limited number of studies, has been shown to decrease enteric CH4 emission in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, oregano has been suggested as a potential CH4 mitigating agent. This study consisted of 2 in vitro and 2 in vivo experiments. Experiment (Exp.) 1 was aimed at establishing the effect of AT on CH4 emission in vitro. Two experiments (Exp. 2 and 3) with lactating dairy cows were conducted to determine the antimethanogenic effect of AT and oregano (Exp. 3) in vivo. Another experiment (Exp. 4) was designed to investigate stability of bromoform (CHBr3) in AT over time. In Exp. 3, 20 Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four 28-d periods. Treatments were basal diet (control) or basal diet supplemented with (dry matter basis) 0.25% AT (LowAT), 0.50% AT (HighAT), or 1.77% oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) leaves. Enteric gas emissions were measured using the GreenFeed system (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD), and rumen samples were collected for fermentation analysis using the ororuminal technique. In Exp.1 (in vitro), relative to the control, AT (at 1% dry matter basis, inclusion rate) decreased CH4 yield by 98%. In Exp. 3, HighAT decreased average daily CH4 emission and CH4 yield by 65% and 55%, respectively, in experimental periods 1 and 2, but had no effect in periods 3 and 4. The differential response to AT among experimental periods was likely a result of a decrease in CHBr3 concentration in AT over time, as observed in Exp. 4 (up to 84% decrease in 4 mo of storage). In Exp. 3, H2 emission was increased by AT and, as expected, the proportion of acetate in the total volatile fatty acids in the rumen was decreased and those of propionate and butyrate were increased by HighAT compared with the control. Compared with the control, HighAT decreased dry matter intake, milk yield, and energy-corrected milk yield in Exp. 3. Milk composition was not affected by treatment, except lactose percentage and yield were decreased by HighAT. Concentrations of iodine and bromide in milk were increased by HighAT compared with the control. Milk CHBr3 concentration and its organoleptic characteristics were not different between control and HighAT. Oregano had no effect on CH4 emission or lactational performance of the cows in Exp. 3. Overall, AT included at 0.50% in the ration of dairy cows can have a large mitigation effect on enteric CH4 emission, but dry matter intake and milk production may also decrease. There was a marked decrease in the CH4 mitigation potential of AT in the second half of Exp. 3, likely resulting from CHBr3 decay over time.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With a growing demand for safe and sustainable alternatives to antimicrobials, functional feed ingredients such as plant essential oils have been evaluated for their potential to improve gut health. Amongst these, oregano essential oil (OEO) with the main active compounds carvacrol and thymol has been reported to have antimicrobial and antioxidative properties resulting in improved intestinal barrier function and growth in pigs and poultry. However, its impact on the gut microbiota still remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of an oregano essential oil phytobiotic on sow and piglet performance and faecal microbiota. RESULTS: Piglets from OEO supplemented sows were significantly heavier at one week of age and showed a trend for improved average daily weight gain from birth to weaning. Post-weaning, maternally supplemented piglets were numerically heavier at 10 weeks post-weaning and at slaughter with a reduced variability in bodyweight. Health records showed that piglets in the OEO supplemented litters had significantly reduced incidence of therapeutic treatment and reduced mortality. In both sows and piglets, the structure and composition of the faecal microbiota varied considerably over time. Sows supplemented with OEO during lactation showed an increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae family. In addition, there was an increase in the relative abundance of families known to be important in fibre digestion (Fibrobacteriaceae and Akkermansiaceae). Analysis of piglet microbiota at two weeks and four weeks of age revealed a relative decrease in Enterobacteriaceae while butyrate producers (Lachnospiraceae family) were increased at both timepoints. CONCLUSION: We hypothesise that the effects observed from this study were exerted through modulation of the gut microbial communities in the sow and her offspring through maternal microbial transfer. Understanding the link between the gut microbiota and dietary factors represents a keystone to improving health and performance for sustainable pig production. Reducing antimicrobial usage can help to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is a global focus for animal production."

      "abstract": "Herbs and spices have been used throughout human history for their medicinal qualities. The advent of cheap and readily available medicines have lessened the need for herbs and spices as traditional medicines, however, they are rapidly regaining popularity with rising interest of the general population in health, natural products and nutrition. The need for alternative medicines with antimicrobial properties, such as herbs and spices, has also come to the forefront in light of the recent bans of antibiotic use in the livestock industry, including the poultry industry. This large scale use presents an opportunity to observe nutrigenomic effects of prolonged use of herbs on a substantial number of birds fed high concentrations of these products throughout the production cycle. In this manuscript, we investigated the transcriptional effect of continual prolonged oregano supplementation on chicken ileum gene expression. Based on ileum transcriptomics, we report that continual supplementation with 2% oregano altered microbiota-gut-brain axis signalling, rearranged cancer susceptibility towards reduced steroid hormone-related cancers and altered expression of genes targeted by many registered drugs, thus likely affecting their efficiency and side effects. Transcriptional toxicology analysis indicated significant activation of Ventricular Septal Defect and Congenital Heart Disease categories. Our results, counter the notion that natural products such as oregano have the potential for little to no side-effects as they are \"natural\". The nutrigenomic approach of understanding benefits and side effects of the food we eat, can revolutionize disease management and therapy and have special significance in designing the diets for individuals or livestock with known disease predispositions.",

METHODS: Frankfurters were processed under six treatment conditions: control (10.67% pork fat), MOP (control + 0.01% MOP), MOL (control + 0.01% MOL), MOP-N (control + 0.01% MOP + 6% pecan nut paste), MOL-N (control + 0.01% MOL + 6% pecan nut paste), and C-N (control + 6% pecan nut paste). The physicochemical properties and the consumer acceptability were determined. RESULTS: The addition of MO and nut did not influence the water holding capacity, drip loss, and luminosity of frankfurters, but those ingredients increased pH and shear force (p<0.05) and decreased redness (p<0.05) of frankfurters. Frankfurters were generally well accepted by consumers. However, general acceptability of sausages decreased with the addition of MO. Control sausages showed the highest acceptability. CONCLUSION: The MO and pecan nut paste do not affect drastically the quality of frankfurters. These results provide evidence that partial replacement of pork fat by pecan nut in frankfurters maintain a consistent physicochemical quality and its commercialization looks promising given consumers' acceptance."

      "abstract": "Traditional infection prevention and treatment methods include synthetic antibiotics, which can cause severe adverse side effects. Carvacrol and thymol are biologically active monoterpenoid extractants from oregano leaves with antibiotic capabilities; however, little is known regarding their effects on bone tissue engineering. The objective of this work is to understand their effects on osteogenesis, specifically with osteoblast and osteoclast cells, from surface-modified Ti6Al4V with plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings. This system is an alternative to cemented implants to aid in bone healing. Results reveal that full carvacrol release from the HA matrix is successful in aqueous environments and modulation of release kinetics can also be made using polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers. From HA-pressed disc samples in physiological pH, full carvacrol release is achieved in 10 days using PCL/PEG, about 95% release in 50 days using no polymer, and 60% in 50 days when using a PCL coating. Without polymer, full carvacrol release is achieved after 3 days from HA coatings in both physiological pH and acidic pH, mimicking the post-surgery environment. The release is assessed as a diffusion-based mechanism in phosphate-buffered saline but degradation-based mechanism in acetate buffer solution. Carvacrol and thymol show bacterial inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis and no cytotoxic effects on osteoblast proliferation in vitro. Carvacrol and thymol also induce a significant 7% reduction in osteoclast tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, caused by poorly attached cellular morphologies, leading to an approximately 65% reduction in osteoclast resorption pit formation. Our goal is to demonstrate a natural medicinal system that can support bone healing while providing infection prevention and reducing costly revision surgeries for orthopedic and dental applications.",

      "abstract": "Heavy metals are the cause of one of the most significant biosphere contamination problems worldwide, as they can be highly reactive and toxic according to their oxidation levels. Their toxic effects are correlated with the elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative cellular damage occurring in plants. The aim of the present study was the investigation of the effects of three heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn) applied to the soil in biochemical defense-related responses and allergen production in the aromatic plant oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) from the Lamiaceae family. The concentrations of the three heavy metals used, were based on the 2002 Regulation of the Polish Ministry of the Environment on Soil Quality Standards [(i) agricultural land (group B): Ni 100 ppm, Ni 210 ppm, Cu 200 ppm, Cu 500 ppm, Zn 720 ppm and (ii) industrial land (group C): Ni 500 ppm, Cu 1000 ppm, Zn 1500 ppm, Zn 3000 ppm]. The investigated plants accumulated heavy metal ions in aerial parts to a variable extent. For plants grown in soil contaminated with Zn, phenotypic representation of the growth and development were strongly limited and dependent on zinc concentration. Phenotypic representation of plants grown in soil contaminated with Ni and Cu were characterized by normal growth, slightly lower or equal to that of the control plants. All tested metals (Ni, Cu, Zn) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in photosynthetic pigments especially in total chlorophyll content. Highest cellular damage levels were observed in plants treated with Cu and Zn. Increasing concentration of these metals (especially Zn) caused a further increase in cellular damage. 3000 ppm Zn caused highest increase in the concentration of proline compared with control plants, suggesting osmotic stress imposition. Treatment with 1000 ppm Cu led to increased concentration of the allergenic protein profilin in relation to control plants by profilin ELISA analysis, while increasing concentrations of Cu and Zn led to a decrease in the concentration of phenolic compounds and total antioxidant capacity. On the basis of these findings, Ni stress in oregano plants appears to be less damaging (in relation to Cu and Zn) and with lower allergenic potential, compared with 1000 ppm Cu. The present study provides novel biochemical insight in the defense and allergenic response of aromatic plants to metal ions present in the rhizosphere; however, more comprehensive research under realistic field conditions is needed to fully decipher this interaction.",

The rates of acaricide efficacy, weekly mite fall, bee mortality, colony survivorship, and strength, were determined for each of the treatments. All formulations, with the exemption of OO microcapsules, were effective at controlling infestations of V. destructor. The most effective formulations were T dust (96.6%), T glycerin (92.4%), and OA glycerin (79%). More than 85% of the mites were killed during the first 2 wk of treatment with T formulations, compared to less than 30% for the OA glycerin formulation. The lowest efficacy rate was for OO microcapsules (21.3%), and the only treatment that significantly increased bee mortality was OA glycerin. The rates of winter colony survival and honey bee populations were related to the varroacidal efficacy of the formulations. The implications of these findings are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the in vitro effects of Greek oregano and garlic essential oils on inhibition of Eimeria parasites and their in vivo effects on production performance, intestinal bacteria counts, and oocyst output. An inhibition assay was performed in vitro using Eimeria tenella Wisconsin strain sporozoites and Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Intracellular sporozoite invasion was quantified by detection of E. tenella DNA using qPCR from cell monolayers harvested at 2 and 24 h post-infection. Parasite invasion was inhibited by the oregano essential oil at the concentration of 100 μg/ml by 83 or 93% after 2 or 24 h, respectively. Garlic essential oil reached a maximum inhibition of 70% after 24 h with the 50 μg/ml concentration. Normal morphology was observed in MDBK cells exposed to concentrations of 100 μl/ml of garlic or oregano for over 24 h. In the in vivo trial, 180 male broiler chicks (45.3 ± 0.7 g) were allocated into two treatments (6 pens of 15 chicks per treatment). Control treatment was fed commercial diets without antibiotics or anticoccidials. The ORE-GAR treatment was fed the same control diets, further supplemented with a premix (1 g/kg feed) containing the oregano (50 g/kg premix) and garlic (5 g/kg premix) essential oils. At day 37, all birds were slaughtered under commercial conditions, and intestinal samples were collected. ORE-GAR treatment had improved final body weight (1833.9 vs. 1.685.9 g; p < 0.01), improved feed conversion ratio (1.489 vs. 1.569; p < 0.01), and reduced fecal oocyst excretion (day 28: 3.672 vs. 3.989 log oocysts/g, p < 0.01; day 37: 3.475 vs. 4.007 log oocysts/g, p < 0.001). In the caecal digesta, ORE-GAR treatment had lower total anaerobe counts (8.216 vs. 8.824 CFU/g; p < 0.01), whereas in the jejunum digesta the ORE-GAR treatment had higher counts of E. coli (5.030 vs. 3.530 CFU/g; p = 0.01) and Enterobacteriaceae (5.341 vs. 3.829 CFU/g; p < 0.01), and lower counts of Clostridium perfringens (2.555 vs. 2.882 CFU/g; p < 0.01). In conclusion, the combined supplementation of oregano and garlic essential oils had a potent anticoccidial effect in vitro and a growth-promoting effect in broilers reared in the absence of anticoccidial drugs."

Ointment, hydrogel, and nanofiber dressings were synthesized using 5% turmeric, 1% oregano, and 1% chitosan nanoparticles and tested for antibacterial and cytotoxicity in vitro, and wound healing effects in vivo. Turmeric ethanolic extract showed high antioxidant activity compared to Oregano, Chitosan Nanoparticles, and Alginate silver (p-value < 0.0001). The ointment and hydrogel formulation (5% Turmeric, 1% Oregano, and 1% chitosan) showed lower cytotoxicity compared to the commercial Alginate silver dressing. Ointment, hydrogel formulations, and commercial Alginate silver, showed significant antibacterial activity with 100% efficacy on both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (p-value < 0.0001), compared to nanofibers which showed 50% reduction in bacterial growth (p-value < 0.0001). The new formulations were tested in a rat model of pressure ulcers. Ointment and nanofibers achieved complete wound healing by day 15 compared to the hydrogel and commercial Alginate silver dressing, which showed higher infection, and the wound remained partially open by day 21. In conclusion, Turmeric, Oregano extracts, and chitosan nanoparticles can be used for effective wound dressings in both diabetic and non-diabetic wounds. At relatively low concentrations, this combination provides a promising new wound treatment formulation that is antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Determining plant tolerance to water stress is necessary in irrigation scheduling, decisions concerning supplementary irrigation, planning and operation and, more importantly, the rational use of water resources. In the present study, effects of the irrigation regime on oregano growth, water use, yield and quality parameters were investigated using reduced irrigation regime treatments. RESULTS: Increased water stresses caused a decrease in all growth and yield parameters. Plant water use efficiency was not significantly different among the control, low and medium stress treatments, although it was the lowest for the extreme water stress treatment. Total essential oil yield was the only quality parameter demonstrating significant differences among treatments. Yield response factors were determined as 1.13, 1.12, 1.06 and 1.10 for total fresh, total dry, dry leaf and total essential oil yields, respectively. CONCLUSION: Yield response factors indicate that oregano plant is slightly sensitive to water stress. Although the yield parameters were affected by water stress, Origanum onites, under cultivation in recent years, might have developed a resistance mechanism for quality parameters because it has grown in very dry conditions under a natural environment for many years. However, the negative relationships between crop evapotranspiration versus essential oil, total phenolic and flavonoid contents and extract yield indicates that the quality parameters of oregano under low plant water consumption may be increased. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Our previous work indicated that feeding oregano essential oil (OEO) in combination with monensin (MON) may not be mutually beneficial to dairy calf growth performance. To evaluate this observation further, a 240-d long-term growth experiment was conducted using 12 young growing Holstein bulls using a 2 × 2 factorial treatment arrangement. Main factors were OEO and MON arranged in 4 individual treatments: (1) ration fed without OEO or MON (control), (2) OEO fed at 26 mg/kg of dry matter (DM), (3) MON fed at 25 mg/kg of DM, and (4) OEO and MON fed in combination (OEO+MON). Holstein bulls were 70 d of age and similar in body weight (BW; 93.3 ± 4.54 kg) and individually fed for 240 d. The targeted feeding rates of OEO and MON were blended into 200 g of concentrate and top dressed each morning to a corn stalklage-based ration. Body weights, frame measurements, and blood samples were collected monthly. Interactions of OEO by MON were detected for BW, BW gain, average daily gain, and a trend for feed conversion. Bulls fed OEO or MON demonstrated greater final BW (368, 385, 381, and 358 kg for control, OEO, MON, and OEO+MON, respectively), and BW gains (278, 292, 285, and 265 kg) and average daily gain (1.16, 1.22, 1.19, 1.11 kg/d) were greatest for bulls fed OEO or MON compared with bulls fed OEO+MON; bulls fed the control were intermediate and similar to bulls fed MON. Intake of DM was greater for bulls fed OEO (6.55, 6.99, 6.60, and 6.42 kg/d) compared with bulls fed remaining treatments. Frame growth gain measurements for heart girth, abdominal girth, withers height, body length, and cannon bone circumference were similar for bulls fed all treatments. Serum triglyceride (0.23, 0.25, 0.28, and 0.24 mmol/L) concentrations were greater for bulls fed MON compared with bulls fed the control and OEO+MON, and bulls fed OEO were intermediate and similar. Cholesterol (2.06, 2.29, 2.20, and 2.07 mmol/L) concentrations were greater for bulls fed OEO compared with bulls fed the control and OEO+MON, and bulls fed MON were intermediate and similar. Serum antioxidant measurements were similar for bulls fed all treatments. Serum IgA, IgG, and IgM concentrations were similar for bulls fed all treatments. Feeding OEO or MON separately can improve growth performance of growing Holstein bulls. We do not know why the combination of OEO and MON is antagonistic to growth performance of Holstein bulls. However, these technologies should not be fed in combination to growing dairy cattle.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Natural plant essential oils have antimicrobial properties; however, essential oils are difficult to maintain in a system because of their volatile nature. First, we prepared microcapsules from β-cyclodextrin and oregano essential oil and characterized their properties. Second, the effect of microcapsules on the preservation of freshly cut purple yam was studied using an edible coating technique. Purple yams immersed in distilled water were used as control, and their characteristics were compared with yams coated with citric acid, citric acid + sodium alginate, and citric acid + sodium alginate + β-cyclodextrin-oregano essential oil microcapsules (CA-SA-MC) and stored at 4 °C for 5 days. RESULTS: Microcapsules of oregano essential oil and β-cyclodextrin solution were successfully prepared via the inclusion method, with an optimal encapsulation efficiency of 55.14%. Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis showed strong bonds between β-cyclodextrin and oregano essential oil. All edible coatings, particularly CA-SA-MC, significantly (P ≤ 0.05) maintained firmness, total soluble solids, ascorbic acid content, and anthocyanin content compared with control treatment. This treatment also prevented browning and extended the shelf life of purple yam. CONCLUSION: Oregano essential oil can be successfully encapsulated into cyclodextrin microcapsules. It has a great impact on the shelf life extension of purple yam and could be successfully applied to other fresh produce. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The effect of different factors, including the surfactant to oil ratio, the presence of sodium chloride, thermal treatment, and dilution on their formation and physicochemical stability was evaluated. The creation of nano-cargos was confirmed by TEM. The self-associated structures had z-average droplet diameters of 92 to 337 nm without any energy input. Whereas addition of 10% (w/v) NaCl prevented the formation of oregano essential oil nano-assemblies of T80, swollen micelles containing TCA were successfully produced. Moreover, the OR or TCA loaded-micelles had only a slight droplet size variation upon thermal treatment. Ultimately, their antibacterial activity analysis against some food pathogens revealed that the encapsulation of OR and TCA within micelles crucially improved their antibacterial activity. These straightforward and cost-effective designed systems can be applicable in different products, including foods and agrochemicals.",

      "abstract": "Oregano essential oil has long been known for its health-promoting benefits. Here, we report its activity against viral replication. Oregano oil was found to specifically inhibit lentiviruses, such as human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV), irrespective of virus tropism, but not hepatitis C virus, adenovirus 5 (ADV5), Zika virus, and influenza (H1N1) virus. Oregano oil's most abundant components, carvacrol and its isomer, thymol, were shown to block virus-target cell fusion while not perturbing other stages of the virus life cycle. We detected changes in virus particle density, suggesting that cholesterol depletion from the HIV-1 envelope membrane reduces virus entry. Furthermore, infection was rescued by adding exogenous cholesterol. The evolution of viral resistance to carvacrol supported this mechanism of action with the identification of mutations in the viral gp41 fusion protein that counteracted cholesterol depletion. In addition, resistance to carvacrol emerged later than typically observed for other clinically used drugs, strengthening its antiviral potential. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed key motifs of carvacrol and thymol required for HIV neutralization and identified previously unknown active analogs. Carvacrol was also shown to additively cooperate with antiretroviral therapy. In sum, oregano oil and improved carvacrol and thymol analogs could be considered to supplement current HIV therapeutics.IMPORTANCE Oregano essential oil has multiple benefits in traditional medicine, cosmetics, and food industries. Carvacrol and its analog, thymol, are well-described components of oregano oil. Here, we show that these compounds inhibit HIV-target cell fusion independently of viral tropism. Our results suggest that carvacrol and thymol alter the cholesterol content of the viral membrane, blocking HIV-1 entry into the target cell. Resistance to carvacrol has selected for viruses with mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp41. This protein is known for its interaction with cholesterol present in membrane lipid rafts. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of therapies targeting the viral envelope membrane, and oregano oil is a safe supplement to antiretrovirals, potentially delaying disease progression and resistance development.",

Control (C); 0.5% citric acid added (S); 1% oregano essential oil added (O); and citric acid and oregano essential oil combined (OS) groups were prepared. Samples were inoculated with L. monocytogenes, vacuum packed, then sous-vide cooked at 55, 57.5, 60, or 62.5 °C for predetermined times. The D-values of all treated samples were significantly lower than control. The use of oregano oil (O), citric acid (S) and their combination (OS) significantly reduced the time required to inactivate L. monocytogenes. The z-values of L. monocytogenes in C, O, S and OS groups were 5.50, 5.62, 6.54, and 6.92 °C, respectively.

      "abstract": "Symbiotic plant-microorganisms interaction is a promising approach to avoid the environmental hazards of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Among these, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to improve the growth and quality of many plant species; however the detailed metabolic mechanisms behind such beneficial effects are far from complete. Further, elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) could affect such AMF-plant association. Herein, we have investigated the individual and synchronous impact of AMF and eCO2 (620 ppm) on nutrient uptake, growth, photosynthesis, respiration, and levels of primary and secondary metabolites in oregano (Oreganum vulgare), an economically important herbal plant. Enhanced AMF colonization rate and a better mycelial growth were observed in roots of oregano grown under eCO2. Both AMF and eCO2 treatments significantly enhanced the growth and photosynthesis of oregano plants, however much improvements were observed by their synchronous application. eCO2 further increased the AMF-induced dark respiration and accumulation of macro and microelements. Hierarchical clustering analysis of individual primary and secondary metabolites revealed a metabolite-dependent response toward AMF and eCO2. The synchronous application of AMF and eCO2 resulted in promoted accumulation of the majority of the detected sugars, organic acids, amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, phenolic acids and flavonoids, as compared with the sole treatments. Moreover, AMF and eCO2 acted synergistically in improving the antioxidant capacity and anti-lipid peroxidation activity of oregano. Therefore, this study suggests that AMF treatment induces a global metabolic change in oregano, the effect that is strengthened under eCO2.",
