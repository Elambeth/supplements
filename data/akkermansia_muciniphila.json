      "abstract": "The development of ecologically based in vivo microecological formulations for treating Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a current research focus. Here, we selected three microorganisms-Akkermansia muciniphila (AM), Bacteroides ovatus (BO), and Bifidobacterium breve (BB)-to formulate a mixed bacterial formulation (ABB). Subsequently, we evaluated the ecological interactions among these three microorganisms and investigated their therapeutic efficacy in a CDI murine model. Our investigation revealed the presence of a commensalism relationship among AM, BO, and BB. These microorganisms collectively formed a robust and densely packed symbiotic biofilm, with BB being the predominant member in terms of numerical abundance. This phenomenon was concomitant with a marked elevation in the levels of AI-2 and c-di-GMP. ABB exhibits the capability to inhibit crucial biological indicators of C. difficile (CD), such as toxin production, through the secretion of substantial quantities of lactic acid. Additionally, ABB indirectly suppresses CD by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway in Raw 264.7 cells, which stimulates the secretion of significant quantities of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β. ABB demonstrated exceptional efficacy in a CDI murine model, as evidenced by a substantial enhancement in survival rates and intestinal short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) level, the down-regulation of inflammation-associated cytokine secretion, a notable reduction in fecal CD toxin levels, and CD viable bacterial counts. Concurrently, there was an augmentation in the level of gut microbial diversity, accompanied by a rapid reduction in Enterococcus abundance. This ABB formulation holds promise for further development into a novel microecological formulation for the treatment of CDI."

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a severe metabolic disorder that occurs during pregnancy and is linked to dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, characterised by a decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK). Emerging evidence suggests that pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila (pAKK) is a promising candidate for preventing or treating obesity-related metabolic disorders. However, the modulatory function and the underlying mechanisms of pAKK supplementation in PE remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the impact of pAKK oral administration on PE and its underlying mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that pAKK significantly improved PE-like symptoms in mice induced by nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, pAKK inhibited L-NAME-induced placental apoptosis, countered apoptosis-related biochemical alterations like the increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and the activation of cleaved-Caspase-3, alongside mitigating L-NAME-induced placental mitochondrial dysfunction. Hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R)-induced HTR8/SVneo cells have been established as an in vitro model to mimic the condition of PE. Interestingly, similar results were also obtained in vitro; mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis induced by H/R in HTR-8/SVneo cells was prevented by pAKK. Importantly, the PI3K inhibitor (LY-294002) significantly negated the protective effects of pAKK on mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed that pAKK treatment improved the composition of gut microbiota communities in PE mice. Our findings indicate that pAKK improved PE-like symptoms both in vivo and in vitro by activating the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, highlighting the potential for developing a probiotic therapeutic agent based on AKK for PE."

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke concurrent with gut microbiome dysbiosis induces intestinal damage, which exacerbates cerebral infarction. Probiotic or prebiotic interventions that reverse gut microbiome dysbiosis can promote recovery after ischemic stroke. Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) safeguards intestinal health and is a promising probiotic; however, its role in ischemic stroke remains unclear. In this study, we found that live AKK, but not pasteurized AKK, mitigated ischemic-stroke-induced neurological injury, reduced cerebral infarction, and enhanced both blood-brain and intestinal barrier integrity. Moreover, the AKK supernatant reduced intestinal and cerebral injury, demonstrating efficacy comparable to that of live AKK. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the AKK supernatant was significantly enriched in indole lactic acid (ILA), a tryptophan metabolite. ILA levels were elevated in the serum and brains of pseudo-germ-free stroke rats administered AKK. Exogenous gavage with ILA mitigated ischemic-stroke-induced brain and intestinal damage. Mechanistically, ILA activated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the nuclear transcription factor Nrf2, leading to the upregulation of SLC7A11 and GPX4 protein expression. This attenuated lipid peroxidation and intracellular iron accumulation triggered by ischemic stroke. Notably, intervention with the AhR inhibitor CH223191 abrogated the protective effects of ILA in ischemic stroke rats. These findings suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of AKK in ischemic stroke is at least partially attributable to ILA-mediated ferroptosis inhibition via AhR activation. AKK was selectively enriched by Puerariae lobatae Radix-resistant starch (PRS), promoting ILA generation more effectively than inulin and β-glucan. AKK and PRS synergistically alleviated ischemic-stroke-induced impairments, outperforming monomicrobial or prebiotic treatment alone. These findings reveal the unique mechanisms of AKK in ischemic stroke and provide a viable strategy for the clinical treatment of ischemic stroke through a novel synbiotic combination."

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) shows a limited response to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapies. Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) may enhance tumor immunity. This study examines how its Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) and Amuc_1434 influence PD-L1 expression and CD8+ T cell activity in CRC. OMVs were isolated and their characteristics were examined through transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. PD-L1 expression was quantified via Western blot, while CD8+ T cell proliferation was measured using flow cytometry. Cytokine production (interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)) was evaluated using ELISA. A CRC mouse model was employed to examine its impact on tumor growth and immune cell infiltration. In CRC cells, treatment with AKK-derived OMVs (AKK-OMVs) significantly downregulated PD-L1 expression (p < 0.05) and markedly increased CD8+ T cell proliferation and the levels of IFN-γ and IL-2 (p < 0.01). Amuc_1434 was identified as the key protein mediating these effects. In vivo, AKK-OMVs treatment substantially reduced tumor volume (p < 0.01) and significantly enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (p < 0.01). Additionally, AKK-OMVs-treated mice showed increased expression of immune activation markers within the tumor tissue, further indicating enhanced antitumor immunity. This study reveals that AKK-OMVs, particularly those containing Amuc_1434, can modulate PD-L1 expression and potentiate CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in CRC. These findings suggest a novel approach to overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in CRC.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies demonstrate that intestinal microbiota contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC), which is often associated with dysbiosis. Most of the data were obtained from studies on CRC patients, making it challenging to determine whether alterations in microbiota are a consequence of the pathology or whether they actively drive its progression. Several studies using laboratory animals suggest that gut microbiota may be involved in both the onset and progression of CRC. In the present study we utilized the azoxymethane-dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) mouse model of CRC to investigate the contribution of healthy-state microbiota to inflammation-associated tumorigenesis. Two cohorts of C57BL/6 mice harboring different intestinal microbiota demonstrated different susceptibility to AOM/DSS treatment. Sequencing of 16S rRNA bacterial DNA from fecal samples revealed Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides acidifaciens as marker features in the healthy-state microbiota (before AOM/DSS administration), which showed a strong positive correlation with tumor incidence. Moreover, the healthy-state abundance of these markers, considered beneficial bacteria, was strongly positively correlated with the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio fairfieldensis identified as a marker of chronic colitis-associated microbiota. Furthermore, the abundances of these marker features, associated with CRC outcome, correlated with the expression of interferon gamma and nitric oxide synthase 2 genes in colon tissue during the early stage of DSS-induced intestinal inflammation. In contrast to multiple studies demonstrating the anti-inflammatory properties of A. muciniphila and B. acidifaciens, our results point out their potential adverse effect under specific conditions of genotoxicity and inflammation in the intestine. Taken together, our findings suggest a complex, context-dependent role of commensal microbiota in inflammation-associated dysbiosis and CRC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease is a long-standing inflammatory disorder that influences the intestinal tract. The intent of this research is to explore whether the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila is related to the IL6/STAT3 pathway and the fundamental molecular mechanisms of A. muciniphila on a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced enteritis mouse model, including the expression of inflammatory cytokines and proteins in the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway. METHODS: The association between the A. muciniphila and IL6/STAT3 was investigated by using mucosal biopsies and fecal samples. TNBS-induced colitis mouse models were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The alteration of intestinal microbiota was organized by 16s rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: In Crohn's disease patients, the level of STAT3 and IL-6 presented a negative relationship with A. muciniphila. The expression of IL-6, p-STAT3, and STAT3 was downregulated in A.m+TNBS group, indicating A. muciniphila may inhibit the IL6/STAT3 pathway in TNBS-induced enteritis in vivo. To investigate the potential defensive role of A. muciniphila supplementation in vivo with TNBS-induced enteritis, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze changes in the intestinal microbiota composition. The results revealed a marked increase in microbial diversity and abundance within the A. muciniphila-treated group, suggesting a beneficial modulation of the gut microbiome associated with the supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings declared that A. muciniphila supplementation alleviates gastrointestinal inflammation through IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. This protective effect was mediated by the downregulation of the IL-6 and STAT3, highlighting a potential mechanism by which A. muciniphila modulates inflammatory responses. This work disclosed that A. muciniphila demonstrates a defensive influence against TNBS-induced enteritis in vivo, proposing it qualified as a unique therapeutic focusing on modulating IL-6, STAT3, or p-STAT3 in the treatment of colitis."

      "abstract": "While convenient for patient compliance, the efficacy of oral treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is often compromised by the dynamic and harsh chemical environment of the gastrointestinal tract, presenting challenges for effective therapeutic management. The pathological complexity of IBD frequently involves multiple factors such as oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, gut microbiome abnormality, and inadequate drug bioavailability, among others. To address these challenges, this project develops an oral nanomedicine platform based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with a cerium oxide core, further coated with an outer membrane (OM) derived from Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk), a beneficial bacteria naturally present in the human gut. This novel nanocomplex, termed \"OM-CeMeso,\" is evaluated for its enhanced stability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, and ability to restore microbiota homeostasis. This project demonstrates that the silica-based nanomaterials' acid-resistant yet base-degradable properties significantly improved stability in a murine IBD model. The incorporation of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) added further benefits by enhancing ROS scavenging. Notably, the Akk-derived OM coat also increases the diversity and abundance of beneficial gut microbiota. These complementary and integrated functions lead to significant symptom alleviation in murine IBD models while avoiding any unwanted toxicity."

      "abstract": "Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), classified as \"lean bacteria,\" has emerged as a promising candidate for ameliorating metabolic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, and liver disease. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of AKK to counteract metabolic dysfunctions induced by Olanzapine (OLZ), a first-class antipsychotic known for its high therapeutic efficacy but also its association with metabolic disturbances, particularly Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). Previous studies have implicated progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) as a key player in antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. Using male C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet, we assessed the effects of AKK supplementation on OLZ-induced metabolic disturbances. Key parameters such as body weight, hepatic injury markers, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism were analyzed. The study revealed that AKK supplementation reduced hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance, while normalizing lipid and glucose metabolism. These effects are likely mediated through the restoration of PGRMC1/SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway by AKK. Additionally, changes in gut microbiota composition, including a reduction in pathogenic bacteria such as Lactococcus and enrichment of beneficial bacteria, were observed. Overall, the study suggests that AKK has therapeutic potential to counteract OLZ-induced MASLD by modulating gut microbiota and key metabolic pathways, making it a promising strategy for managing metabolic side effects in patients receiving antipsychotic treatment."

Transplantation of human fecal into C57BL/6 mice yielded varied outcomes: some mice showed significant improvements while others had negligible changes, indicating that these changes are due to differences in FMT colonization. Metagenomic analysis, stratified by memory performance, revealed a positive correlation between the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and improved memory. Moreover, administering two A. muciniphila strains, GMB 0476 and GMB 2066, to wild-type mice elevated spatial working memory via BDNF activation.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To explore the effect of A. muciniphila gavage on intestinal microbiota and gut-brain interaction disorders (DGBIs) in gp120tg transgenic mouse models of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). METHODS: Intestinal microbiota was detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in 6-, 9-, and 12-month-old wild-type (WT) mice and gp120tg transgenic mice. The 12-month-old WT and transgenic mice were divided into 2 groups for daily treatment with PBS or A.muciniphila gavage (2×108 CFU/mouse) for 6 weeks. After the treatment, immunohistochemistry, ELISA and qPCR were used to detect changes in colonic expression levels of glycosylated mucins, MBP and IL-1β, eosinophil infiltration, serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and colonic expressions of occludin, ZO-1, IL-10, TNF-α and INF-γ mRNA. Morris water maze test and immunofluorescence assay were used to assess learning and spatial memory abilities and neuronal damage of the mice. RESULTS: Compared with WT mice, the transgenic mice exhibited significantly lowered Simpson's diversity of the intestinal microbiota with reduced abundance of Akkermansia genus, increased serum LPS levels and decreased colonic expression of glycosylated mucin. A.muciniphila gavage obviously ameliorated the reduction of glycosylated mucin in the transgenic mice without causing significant changes in body weight. The 12-month-old gp120tg mice had significantly decreased cdonic expressions of Occludin and ZO-1 with increased eosinophil infiltration and TNF-β, INF-γ and IL-1β levels and obviously lowered IL-10 level; all these changes were significantly mitigated by A.muciniphila gavage, which also improved cognitive impairment and neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cortex of the transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: The gp120tg mice have lower intestinal microbiota richness and diversity than WT mice. The 12-month-old gp120tg mice have significantly reduced Akkermansia abundance with distinct DGBIs-related indexes, and A. muciniphila gavage can reduce intestinal barrier injury, colonic inflammation and eosinophil activation, cognitive impairment and brain neuron injury in these mice.",

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to March 2024, identifying 15 eligible studies. RESULTS: Supplementation with A. muciniphila, its outer membrane protein (Amuc_1100), and extracellular vesicles (EVs) alleviated anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, and enhanced memory in mice. Compared to controls, intervention groups exhibited reduced anxiety-like behaviors, including increased travel distance in the open-field test (OFT) and more time spent in the lightbox during the light-dark box (LDB) test and open arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Depression-like symptoms were reduced, with lower immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim tests. Memory function also improved, and learning time was reduced in the Y-maze and Barnes circular maze tests. Serotonin levels increased significantly in the serum and hippocampus, while corticosterone levels decreased, though not significantly. The intervention reduced hippocampal and serum inflammatory markers (TNFα, IL1β, IL6) and altered gut microbiome composition, increasing Akkermansia, Roseburia, Caldicoprobacter, and Lachnospiraceae. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the health-promoting effects of A. muciniphila, one of the next-generation probiotics, in alleviating neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the high prevalence and clinical significance of depression, anxiety, and stress, further investigation into the therapeutic utility of A. muciniphila is warranted."

Since its identification in 2004, A. muciniphila has emerged as a significant agent in treating metabolic diseases, gastroenterological diseases, and tumor immunotherapy. Its rapid ascent in scientific translation underscores its importance in gut microbiome research. However, there has been a lack of visualization and analysis of the rapidly occurring commercialization in this field, which has critically hindered insights into the current knowledge structure and understanding of the cutting-edge of the discipline. This study employs the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) and Innography platforms to provide the first comprehensive analysis of A. muciniphila's academic progresses and commercialization over the past two decades, highlighting its growing prominence in global health research. Our analysis delineates that, following the academic trajectory, the evolution of A. muciniphila patents from foundational research through to application development and maturity, with particular emphasis on its expansive potential in emerging fields, including gastroenterological disorders, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer immunotherapy, stress management, and neurodegenerative disease treatment. Concluding, A. muciniphila presents as a next-generation probiotic with vast implications for human health. Our findings provide essential insights for future research and product development, contributing to the advancement of this burgeoning field."

In recent years, the relationship between gut microbiota and CNS have received more attention. Homeostatic imbalance of gut microbiota was revealed to participate in the progression of PD. This study detected that Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) was apparently decreased in the feces of PD rats via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Furtherly, we found that exogenous supplementation of A. muciniphila could improve 6-OHDA-induced motor dysfunction and dopamine (DA) neuronal damage and neuroinflammatory factors release in PD rats. Moreover, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) sequencing demonstrated that A. muciniphila addition increased butyrate content both in gut and brain. The subsequent functional experiments confirmed that the exogenous supplementation of butyrate conferred neuroprotection against DA neurotoxicity. Mechanically, butyrate targeted microglia to attenuate DA neuronal injury via inhibiting microglia activation and neuroinflammatory factors production. In conclusion, A. muciniphila protected DA neuronal damage by modulating butyrate to inhibit microglia-elicited neuroinflammation. These findings provided a potential application of A. muciniphila on PD treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown changes in gut microbiota after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but there is limited research linking the gut microbiota of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) to metabolic diseases. METHODS: A total of 103 PLWHIV were followed for 48 weeks of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), with demographic and clinical data collected. Gut microbiome analysis was conducted using metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples from 12 individuals. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was diagnosed based on controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values of 238 dB/m from liver fibro-scans. Participants were divided based on the presence of metabolic disorders, including NAFLD, overweight, and hyperlipidemia. Akkermansia abundance in stool samples was measured using RT-qPCR, and Pearson correlation and logistic regression were applied for analysis. RESULTS: Metagenomic sequencing revealed a significant decline in gut Akkermansia abundance in PLWHIV with NAFLD. STAMP analysis of public datasets confirmed this decline after HIV infection, while KEGG pathway analysis identified enrichment of metabolism-related genes. A prospective cohort study with 103 PLWHIV followed for 48 weeks validated these findings. Akkermansia abundance was significantly lower in participants with NAFLD, overweight, and hyperlipidemia at baseline, and it emerged as an independent predictor of NAFLD and overweight. Negative correlations were observed between Akkermansia abundance and both CAP values and body mass index (BMI) at baseline and at week 48. At the 48-week follow-up, Akkermansia remained a predictive marker for NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Akkermansia abundance was reduced in PLWHIV with metabolic disorders and served as a predictive biomarker for NAFLD progression over 48 weeks of ART.",

However, its increased presence in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has led to a focus on the relationships between A. muciniphila and diseases, with the underlying mechanisms remaining unknown. METHOD: Solochrome cyanin, hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess demyelination and inflammation. Gut microbiota changes were examined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Intracellular cytokine levels were assessed by flow cytometry. Cognitive impairment was evaluated using four behavioral tests. Intestinal barrier function and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated neuroinflammation were evaluated by immunoblotting. RESULTS: We found that treatment with an appropriate dose of A. muciniphila (5.0 × 107 CFU/mL) reduced neuropathology and disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. In addition, A. muciniphila supplementation increased the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota while decreasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Moreover, it improved intestinal barrier function and attenuated Th17 responses in the gut, central nervous system (CNS), and lymphoid tissues, without affecting Treg response in the lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, A. muciniphila administration partly regulated cognitive impairment and hippocampal NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that A. muciniphila holds promise as a probiotic for treating NLRP3-associated inflammatory disorders and cognitive impairment, including MS.",

Recent studies have demonstrated the antioxidative effect of the gut commensal bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muc); however, whether it can alleviate ferroptosis remains unclear. The current study indicates A. muc intervention efficiently reversed high-fat high-fructose diet (HFHFD)-induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in the liver. These beneficial effects were mediated by activation of the hepatic AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α axis, as evidenced by the finding that AMPK deficiency abrogated the amelioration of lipid peroxidation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were enriched upon A. muc treatment, and acetate was identified as a key activator of hepatic AMPK signalling. Mechanistically, microbiota-derived acetate was transported to the liver and metabolized to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which triggered AMPK activation. Furthermore, a colonization assay in germ-free mice confirmed that A. muc mediated antiferroptotic effects in the absence of other microbes. These data indicated that A. muc exerts antiferroptotic effects against MAFLD, at least partially by producing acetate, which activates the hepatic AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α axis to alleviate ferroptosis via the inhibition of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthesis."

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequently occurring type of liver tumor and is considered one of the most common primary malignant neoplasms. The prognosis for HCC is dismal because of its complicated etiology and high level of medication resistance. Immunotherapy is presently regarded as one of the most effective therapeutic options for HCC; nevertheless, because of the disturbance of intestinal flora, immunotherapy shows low antitumor efficacy. An increasing body of research indicates that intestinal flora, particularly Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), is vital for the treatment of tumors. Studies have demonstrated that the diminished effectiveness of immunotherapy in cancer patients is associated with a reduction in A. muciniphila levels, suggesting that increasing A. muciniphila levels significantly enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. A. muciniphila functions as a gut probiotic and can treat and prevent a wide range of illnesses, including cancer. Consequently, preserving A. muciniphila abundance is enough to prevent and lower the danger of developing cancer disorders. In this review, we critically evaluate the current body of research on A. muciniphila, with a primary focus on its biological properties and functions. The different illnesses that A. muciniphila treats were then discussed, particularly the way it works with liver cancer. This review aims to give a novel treatment plan for patients with HCC as well as a theoretical foundation for improving HCC immunotherapy.",

Akkermansia muciniphila (AM) is being considered a promising candidate for the \"next generation probiotics (NGPs),\" which play an essential role in the field of tumor therapy. However, there are no studies on the efficacy of Se-enriched A. muciniphila (Se-AM) in the field of tumor therapy. The present study utilized inorganic Se bio-enrichment for the preparation of Se-AM. To evaluate the killing effect of Se-AM on CT26 cells, the actual efficacy and safety of Se-AM were investigated in a mouse model of colon cancer. The results showed that the Se-AM-cell lysate was able to significantly kill CT26 cells, but this killing effect was progressively weakened with decreasing concentrations of Se-AM-cell lysate. The results of animal experiments showed that Se-AM was able to safely and effectively curb the disease course of mice with colon tumors, reduce the tumor volume, lower the levels of IL-1β and IL-6, and increase the levels of TNF-α in the colon of mice. Furthermore, treatment with Se-AM in mice led to a restoration of gut microbiota diversity, reaching levels similar to those observed in healthy controls. This restoration was accompanied by a significant enrichment of beneficial genera, such as Turicibacter, Butyricimonas, Prevotella, and Akkermansia. In summary, Se-AM prepared in this study was able to produce effective killing of CT26 cells directly and played a substantial therapeutic role in a mouse model of colon tumors constructed from CT26 cells. Se-AM had no adverse effect on the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidney of mice and demonstrated a high level of safety. Meanwhile, Se-AM significantly raised the level of the Shannon index and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes of the gut microbiota in mice, indicating its ability to regulate the homeostasis of the microbiota. These results imply that Se-AM has great application value in the field of colon cancer treatment."

Akkermansia muciniphila, a symbiotic bacterium essential for intestinal health, is hypothesized to exert its effects via EVs.

Am-EVs exhibited a double-membrane structure, with an average diameter of 92.48 ± 0.28 nm and a proteomic profile comprising 850 proteins. In an in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2), treatment with both 25 and 50 μg/mL Am-EVs significantly reduced oxidative stress markers, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA), while restoring catalase activity (CAT). Am-EVs also suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Subsequent transcriptomic sequencing and Western blot experiments revealed that Am-EVs attenuate the MAPK signaling pathway by downregulating TRIF, MyD88, p38 MAPK, and FOS while upregulating TGFBR2. These findings suggest that Am-EVs mediate anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of MAPK signaling, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents in intestinal inflammation."

The disturbance of gut microbiota aggravates pathogenic bacteria invasion and gut barrier injury. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for microbiome-related disorders, where beneficial strain engraftment is a significant factor influencing FMT outcomes. The aim of this research was to explore the effect of FMT on antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered (AIMD) models infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). We used piglet, mouse, and intestinal organoid models to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of FMT on ETEC infection. The results showed that FMT regulated gut microbiota and enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge, as demonstrated by reduced intestinal pathogen colonization and alleviated gut barrier injury. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) and Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT. We further investigated the alleviatory effects of these two strains on ETEC infection in the AIMD mice model, which revealed that A. muciniphila and B. fragilis relieved ETEC-induced intestinal inflammation by maintaining the proportion of Treg/Th17 cells and epithelial damage by moderately activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the effect of A. muciniphila was better than B. fragilis. We, therefore, identified whether A. muciniphila protected against ETEC infection using basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoid models. A. muciniphila did protect the intestinal stem cells and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and the protective effects of A. muciniphila were reversed by Wnt inhibitor. FMT alleviated ETEC-induced gut barrier injury and intestinal inflammation in the AIMD model. A. muciniphila was identified as a key strain in FMT to promote the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",

Chicory extract fermented by Akkermansia muciniphila (C-Akm) was selected as the most antioxidant of 20 fermented extracts. The identification of metabolites derived from C-Akm extract has enabled us to detect mostly amino acids, acids, and some polyphenols (daidzein and genistein). The anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity activities of C-Akm extract were studied by testing the extract (50 μg/mL) on the polarization of THP-1 into macrophages, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated PBMCs, and the secretion of leptin and adiponectin in adipospheroids derived from human adipose stem cells. Finally, the extract was examined in 3D co-culture model mimicking inflamed obese adipose tissue. We found that C-Akm extract decreased ROS generation, TNF-α and Il-6 gene expression in polarized macrophages, INFγ and IL-17A secretion in LPS-stimulated PBMCs stimulated with LPS. It also decreased leptin expression while increasing adiponectin and HSL expression levels in both adipocytes and co-cultures. In addition, C-Akm extract stimulated adiponectin secretion in the co-culture model. Finally, our in vitro investigations demonstrated the potential benefits of C-Akm extract in the prevention and treatment of obesity-related inflammation."

Quercetin, one of the most important dietary flavonoids, is being explored as an effective therapy for obesity with its mechanism remains understudied. Here in this study, it is demonstrated that quercetin intervention significantly reverses obesity-related phenotypes through reshaping the overall structure of microbiota, especially boosting colonization of the beneficial gut commensal Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila). Enrichment of A. muciniphila leads to generate more indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) to upregulate the expression of 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) via fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)/ N6-methyladenosine (m6A)/YTHDF2 manner, thereby facilitating cholesterol converts to cholic acid (CA). CA in turn drastically suppresses lipid accumulation via activating the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in adipose tissue. This work introduces a novel therapeutic target for addressing obesity and expands upon the current limited understanding of the mediator function of m6A modifications in microorganism-influenced bile acid (BA) metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) remains an intractable and relapsing disease featured by intestinal inflammation. The anti-UC activity of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), an intestinal microorganism, has been widely investigated. The current work is to explore the impacts of AKK on UC and its possible reaction mechanism. In vivo UC model was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced THP-1-M0 and raw264.7 macrophages were treated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). H&E staining evaluated tissue damage. Inflammatory and oxidative stress levels were assessed by relevant kits. The high-throughput analysis of fatty acids was performed by the LC/MS method. RT-qPCR and Western blot detected related gene expression. Flow cytometry measured cell apoptosis and macrophage polarization. Energy metabolism was detected by ELISA, related assay kits, JC-1 staining, and Western blot. AKK reduced the pathological damage of mice colon tissues, alleviated oxidative stress and inflammatory response, upregulated the expression of Occludin-1 and SCFAs receptors, and stimulated M1 to M2 macrophage polarization in vivo. After FFAR2 was silenced, the promoting role of AKK in the viability and M1 to M2 macrophage polarization and the inhibitory role in oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, energy metabolism disorder, necroptosis, and pyroptosis were both reverted. Conclusively, AKK might mediate SCFAs-SLC52A2/FFAR2 pathways to exert protective activities against intestinal inflammatory response in UC, suggesting that AKK might represent a novel and promising candidate for UC therapy."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The gut microbiota is closely associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Probiotics such as Clostridium butyricum (CB) or Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) have the potential to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). However, research on the combined therapeutic effects and immunomodulatory mechanisms of CB and AKK in treating IBD or CRC has never been studied. This study evaluates the potential of co-administration of CB and AKK in treating DSS/AOM-induced IBD and colitis-associated CRC. Our results indicate that compared to mono-administration, the co-administration of CB and AKK not only significantly alleviates symptoms such as weight loss, colon shortening, and increased Disease Activity Index in IBD mice but also regulates the gut microbiota composition and effectively suppresses colonic inflammatory responses. In the colitis-associated CRC mice model, a combination of CB and AKK significantly alleviates weight loss and markedly reduces inflammatory infiltration of macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the colon, thereby regulating anti-tumor immunity and inhibiting the occurrence of inflammation-induced CRC. In addition, we found that the combined probiotic therapy of CB and AKK can enhance the sensitivity of colitis-associated CRC mice to the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-mouse PD-L1 (aPD-L1), significantly improving the anti-tumor efficacy of immunotherapy and the survival rate of colitis-associated CRC mice. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation therapy showed that transplanting feces from CRC mice treated with the co-administration of CB and AKK into other CRC mice alleviated the tumor loads in the colon and significantly extended their survival rate. Our study suggests that the combined use of two probiotics, CB and AKK, can not only alleviate chronic intestinal inflammation but also inhibit the progression to CRC. This may be a natural and relatively safe method to support the gut microbiota and enhance the host's immunity against cancer. IMPORTANCE: Our study suggests that the combined administration of CB and AKK probiotics, as opposed to a single probiotic strain, holds considerable promise in preventing the advancement of IBD to CRC. This synergistic effect is attributed to the ability of this probiotic combination to more effectively modulate the gut microbiota, curb inflammatory reactions, bolster the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches, and optimize treatment results via fecal microbiota transplantation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease (ND). In recent years, multiple clinical and animal studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced by intestinal microbiota metabolism have been considered to be important factors affecting central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Among the main mediators of host-microbe interactions, volatile fatty acids play a crucial role. Nevertheless, the influence and pathways of microorganisms and their metabolites on Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain uncertain. RESULTS: In this study, we present distinctions in blood and fecal SCFA levels and microbiota composition between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with AD. We found that AD patients showed a decrease in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and a decrease in propionic acid both in fecal and in blood. In order to further reveal the effects and the mechanisms of propionic acid on AD prevention, we systematically explored the effects of propionic acid administration on AD model mice and cultured hippocampal neuronal cells. Results showed that oral propionate supplementation ameliorated cognitive impairment in AD mice. Propionate downregulated mitochondrial fission protein (DRP1) via G-protein coupled receptor 41 (GPR41) and enhanced PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy via G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) in AD pathophysiology which contribute to maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. Administered A. muciniphila to AD mice before disease onset showed improved cognition, mitochondrial division and mitophagy in AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that A. muciniphila and its metabolite propionate protect against AD-like pathological events in AD mouse models by targeting mitochondrial homeostasis, making them promising therapeutic candidates for the prevention and treatment of AD.

The enterohepatic axis is one of the targets of recent attention due to its important role in liver diseases. Disulfiram (DSF) is a multitarget drug that has been proven to play a role in a variety of liver diseases and can affect intestinal flora, but whether it can alleviate ALI is not clear. We utilised bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiling, antimicrobial treatments, and faecal microbiota transplantation tests to explore whether DSF therapy for ALI is dependent on gut microbiota. Our findings indicate that DSF primarily restores intestinal microbiome balance by modulating the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), leading to significant alleviation of ALI symptoms in a gut microbiota dependent manner. We also found that A. muciniphila can promote the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, correct the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and further inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, DSF ameliorates ALI by modulating the intestinal microbiome and activating the PI3K/AKT pathway through A. muciniphila.",

      "abstract": "The structural disruption of intestinal barrier and excessive reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) generation are two intertwined factors that drive the occurrence and development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Synchronously restoring the intestinal barrier and mitigating excess RONS is a promising strategy for UC management, but its treatment outcomes are still hindered by low drug accumulation and retention in colonic lesions. Inspired by intestine colonizing bacterium, we developed a mucoadhesive probiotic Akkermansia muciniphila-mimic entinostat-loaded hollow mesopores prussian blue (HMPB) nanotherapeutic (AM@HMPB@E) for UC-targeted therapy via repairing intestinal barrier and scavenging RONS. After oral administration, the negatively charged AM@HMPB@E specifically bind to the positively charged inflamed colon lesions via electrostatic interactions and Akkermansia muciniphila membrane-mediated bioadhesion mechanism. Subsequently, the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-, and catalase (CAT)-like HMPB eliminated RONS, thereby alleviating RONS-mediated inflammation and intestinal epithelial damage. Meanwhile, the UC-site locally released entinostat could repair the damaged intestinal epithelial barrier by inhibiting intestinal endothelial cell apoptosis and up-regulating the expression of tight junctions. Both in vitro and in vivo results shown that AM@HMPB@E not only exhibited an exceptional retention in the colitis site but also demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy compared to the first-line drug sulfasalazine, as evidenced by the longer colon, less rectal bleeding and body weight loss. Collectively, our findings highlight the clinical application prospects of this synchronous nanotherapeutic strategy for UC treatment, offering a paradigm for the rational design of oral nanomedicine.",

Recently, Pasteurized Akk (PA-Akk) has been approved as a functional food. However, the impact of Akk on lipid absorption in the proximal intestine, which is directly exposed to orally administered Akk, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we orally administered Akk and PA-Akk to mice and investigated the subsequent lipid absorption. Long-term administration of Akk resulted in reduced lipid deposits in the liver and adipocytes, along with improved glucose metabolism. This was primarily attributed to a reduction in lipid absorption by epithelial cells in the proximal jejunum. Mechanistically, Akk activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and directly inhibit lipids absorption in both mouse and human jejunal epithelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Akk treatment, but not PA-Akk treatment, promotes the abundance of genera that are highly abundant in the normal jejunum and belong to the phylum Firmicutes. Thus, our study concludes that oral administration of Akk provides beneficial effects on metabolism, partially through inhibiting jejunal lipid absorption and promoting the abundance of core jejunal microbes.",

Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) is a gut commensal that has emerged as a potential modulator of metabolic health and inflammatory conditions. This study investigated the correlation between Akkermansia abundance and BPH severity and metabolic indices in fecal and serum samples from BPH patients and healthy donors using 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolic profiling. A testosterone-induced BPH mouse model was used to evaluate the effects of AKK administration on BPH severity and metabolic indices. Altered gut microbiota diversity was observed in BPH patients, with a significant reduction in Akkermansia abundance. Akkermansia abundance was negatively correlated with BPH symptom score, serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), body mass index (BMI), blood glucose, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). AKK administration in BPH mice resulted in histopathological improvements, reduced prostate index, and amelioration of glandular hyperplasia. Although changes in blood glucose, TC, and LDL-C levels post-AKK supplementation were not statistically significant, a trend toward improvement was noted. Additionally, AKK administration led to a reduction in systemic inflammation markers and restoration of intestinal barrier integrity. In conclusion, AKK might modulate the gut microbiota-prostate axis and MetS. AKK's influence on systemic inflammation and gut barrier function suggests its therapeutic promise in managing BPH and associated metabolic disorders. These findings pave the way for novel microbiota-targeted therapies in the treatment of BPH and MetS.",

While Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) has shown promise in alleviating PE symptoms, the use of live bacteria raises safety concerns. This study explored the potential of pasteurized A. muciniphila (pAKK) as a safer alternative for treating PE, focusing on its effects on endothelial function and metabolic regulation. A PE mouse model was induced via the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, followed by treatment with either pAKK or live AKK. Fecal metabolomic profiling was performed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and in vivo and in vitro experiments were used to assess the effects of pAKK on endothelial function and metabolic pathways. pAKK exhibited therapeutic effects comparable to those of live AKK in improving L-NAME-induced PE-like phenotypes in mice, including enhanced gut barrier function and reduced endotoxemia. pAKK also promoted placental angiogenesis by restoring endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and nitric oxide (NO) production. The in vitro experiments further confirmed that pAKK alleviated L-NAME-induced NO reduction and endothelial dysfunction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Metabolomic analysis revealed that both pAKK and live AKK reversed metabolic disturbances in PE by modulating key metabolites and pathways related to unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, folate, and linoleic acid metabolism. As a postbiotic, pAKK may support existing treatments for preeclampsia by improving gut barrier function, restoring endothelial function, and regulating metabolic dysregulation, offering a safer alternative to live bacteria. These findings highlight the potential clinical value of pAKK as an adjunctive therapy in managing PE."

Intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in intestinal homeostasis, with Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) emerging as a key commensal bacterium utilizing mucin as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. A. muciniphila has been recognized in both experimental and clinical studies for its beneficial role in managing intestinal inflammation, tumors, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and secondary conditions such as liver and metabolic diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the research history and current understanding of A. muciniphila, its association with various intestinal-related diseases, and the potential mechanisms behind its effects.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The interplay between gut microbiota and immune responses is crucial in ulcerative colitis (UC). Though Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk) shows therapeutic potential, the mechanisms remain unclear. This study sought to investigate differences in therapeutic efficacy among different forms or strains of Akk and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Employing a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model, we assessed Akk's impact on colitis using cellular cytokine analysis, immune phenotyping, proteomics, and biochemical methods. Our results suggest that treatment with live Akk effectively reduced colitis in the DSS-induced model, whereas heat-inactivated Akk did not yield the same results. Notably, Akk exhibited protective properties by promoting the secretion of IL-22 by Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), as evidenced by the absence of protection in IL-22 knockout mice. Additionally, Akk augmented the population of CD103+CD11b- dendritic cells (DCs) and enhanced their retinoic acid (RA) synthesis through the modulation of RALDH2, a crucial enzyme in RA metabolism. The depletion of RALDH2 in DCs diminished Akk's protective properties and impaired IL-22-mediated mucosal healing. Mechanistically, Akk activated RA production in DCs by enhancing the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Additionally, various strains of Akk may exhibit differing abilities to alleviate colitis, with the novel strain Am06 derived from breast milk showing consistent efficacy similar to the reference strain. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings indicate that certain strains of Akk may mitigate colitis through the promotion of RA synthesis and IL-22 secretion, underscoring the potential efficacy of Akk as a therapeutic intervention for the management of UC.

Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) has emerged as intricately linked to tumor immunotherapy, yet its impact on natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in immunotherapy, remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of AKK outer membrane proteins on NK cells in LUAD and elucidate potential associated molecular mechanisms. 16S rRNA sequencing was employed to analyze bacterial genera and their abundance in fecal samples from LUAD patients. Co-culturing of NK-92 cells with LUAD cells, with or without treatment of AKK outer membrane protein Amuc_1100, was conducted to investigate the mechanisms of AKK on LUAD. Additionally, a xenograft mouse model was established to validate the effects of AKK in an in vivo setting. The experimental findings indicated that LUAD patients with elevated AKK levels in their fecal samples demonstrated increased NK cell infiltration and reduced TGF-β levels. Treatment with Amuc_1100 elevated TNF-α and IL-15 cytokine levels, decreased TGF-β levels and proteins associated with TGF-β pathway, enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity, upregulated perforin and granzyme B expression, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Amuc_1100 also impeded tumor growth in vivo. In summary, these results suggest that AKK activates NK cells to target tumor cells by suppressing the TGF-β signaling pathway in LUAD cells, underscoring the potential of Akk as an effective immunotherapeutic agent in LUAD NK cell-directed therapies.",

Akkermansia muciniphila, a GM bacteria, has been studied for its potential antidepressant effects. However, its role in influencing the association between prenatal metal exposures and depressive symptoms during childhood is unknown. Leveraging a well-characterized pediatric birth cohort and its microbiome substudy (n = 112), we investigated whether a certain subgroup of children at 9-11-year-of-age (characterized by a specific pattern of prenatal exposure to groups of metals or metal-clique) had worsened depressive symptoms and if the presence of A.muciniphila in GM modifies this association. A subgroup of children characterized by the prenatal metal-clique signature of zinc-chromium-cobalt had significantly increased depression scores; however, within that subgroup, children with A.muciniphila had much lower depression scores than those without A.muciniphila in the GM. Our analysis provides exploratory evidence hypothesizing A.muciniphila as an intervention attenuating the effect of prenatal metal-exposures-associated depressive disorders in late childhood."

      "abstract": "Obesity, diabetes, and related metabolic and health conditions are significant concerns in societies worldwide, necessitating the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies. Gut microbiota, particularly Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), have emerged as key players in the onset of obesity and diabetes due to their impact on metabolic pathways related to food absorption, low-grade inflammation, and insulin signaling. Using A. muciniphila have been identified as a promising approach in obesity and diabetes management. However, the complex culture conditions and animal-based culture medium limitations, restrict its therapeutic perspectives as a probiotic. Pasteurized A. muciniphila has been found to be safe and potentially more cost-effective compared to live strains. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) obese-diabetic models have been used in previous studies due to their functional conservation in lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. These models offer a novel, easy-to-maintain platform for researchers studying obesity and diabetes. So, investigations are suggested to evaluate the effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila on gut microbiota composition, inflammation, and metabolic complications in an obese-diabetic zebrafish model. The findings can be translated into several potential implications and can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of A. muciniphila on obesity and diabetes in the host's body."

We used an Akkermansia muciniphila strain (AKK ONE) isolated from healthy human feces to study its effect on DSS-induced colitis in mice. Our results demonstrate that AKK ONE supplementation significantly improves food intake, weight, colon length, disease activity index (DAI) score, organ index, and tissue damage of colitis mice. AKK ONE notably improved intestinal barrier integrity by significantly enhancing expression of occludin and claudin-1. Additionally, AKK ONE reduced inflammation by down-regulating IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and up-regulating IL-10. In addition to reducing excessive inflammation, AKK ONE also increased the abundance of Akkermansia and decreased the abundance of Bacteroides. Furthermore, the AKK ONE intervention markedly increased SCFAs in cecal contents. AKK ONE may be a potential therapeutic agent for improving UC, based on the findings of this study."

All studies followed Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development protocols (OECD TG 408, 471 473, 474). AMUC was administered to rats via gavage at 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight/day (equivalent to 0, 4.1 × 1010, 9.2 × 1010, and 1.64 × 1011 CFU/kg body weight/day). No mortality or treatment-related adverse effects were reported in any endpoints that were attributed to AMUC consumption. No bacterial translocation of viable A. muciniphila from the intestinal tract was found to the liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, or blood. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was concluded to be the highest dose tested (2000 mg/kg body weight/day), approximately 1.64 × 1011 CFU/kg body weight/day. AMUC (nonviable) was not mutagenic when examined in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay and not clastogenic in an in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration test. Viable AMUC was not genotoxic when evaluated in an in vivo mammalian cell micronucleus assay when administered at up to 1.64 ×1011 CFU/kg body weight/day.

Early weaning strategies may disrupt SIgA levels in piglet intestines, causing a decline in immune response and early weaning stress. However, the specific microbial mechanisms modulating SIgA in early-weaned piglets are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that Akkermansia muciniphila increases intestinal SIgA production in the early-weaned piglets. METHODS: Fecal SIgA levels, SIgA-coated bacteria abundance, and fecal metagenomes were compared between 6 Huanjiang miniature (HM) and 6 Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire (DLY) early-weaned piglets to identify bacterial species involved in SIgA modulation. Four bacterial species were investigated using 5 groups (Control, A. muciniphila, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, and L. acidophilus) of male specific pathogen-free C57BL/6J mice, weaned 3 wk postbirth (n = 8/group). Subsequently, 10-d-old Landrace×Yorkshire (LY) piglets were randomly assigned to 3 groups (Control, 109A. muciniphila, and 108A. muciniphila) (n = 10/group) to evaluate the effect of orally administered A. muciniphila on intestinal SIgA production and microbial composition. RESULTS: HM early-weaned piglets showed significantly higher SIgA levels [7.59 μg/mg, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.2, 12, P = 0.002] and SIgA-coated bacteria abundance (8.64%, 95% CI: 3.2, 14, P = 0.014) than DLY piglets. In the mouse model, the administration of A. muciniphila significantly increased SIgA levels (3.50 μg/mg, 95% CI: 0.59, 6.4, P = 0.018), SIgA-coated bacteria abundance (9.06%, 95% CI: 4, 14, P = 0.018), and IgA+ plasma cell counts (6.1%, 95% CI: 4.3, 8, P = 0.005). In the pig experiments, the oral administration of A. muciniphila to LY piglets significantly enhanced intestinal SIgA concentrations (4.22 μg/mg, 95% CI: 0.37, 8.5, P = 0.034) and altered the SIgA-coated bacterial landscape. CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention with A. muciniphila in nursing piglets can increases intestinal SIgA production and alter the reactivity toward commensal bacteria upon early weaning.",

In the present study, we reported that the mice surviving after 5 months of streptozotocin (STZ) injection had reduced blood glucose level and recovered gut microbiota with increased Akkermansia muciniphila proportion. Gavage of heat-killed A. muciniphila increases the diversity of gut microbiota and elevated immune and metabolic signaling pathways in the intestine. Mechanistically, A. muciniphila treatment promoted the secretion of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) which subsequently activated IGF2 signaling in skeletal muscles and enhanced muscle and global metabolism. Our results suggest that the administration of heat-killed A. muciniphila could be a potential therapeutic strategy for T1DM and its associated hyperglycemia."

This research investigates the effect of A. muciniphila consumption (1 × 109 CFU) on tau protein-induced AD rats compared to a control group. Rats were divided into four groups: sham, sham + Akk, AD (tau-induced rats), and AD + Akk (tau-induced rats treated with A. muciniphila). A. muciniphila gavage lasted five weeks. Rats underwent qRT-PCR analysis to assess mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ) in the hippocampus. Behavioral tests included Morris Water Maze (MWM), Passive Avoidance Memory Test (Shuttle box), Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and marble burying. After five weeks of A. muciniphila treatment, anxiety-like behavior significantly decreased. The AD group receiving A. muciniphila showed improved spatial and recognition memory compared to the AD group. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ) decreased. A. muciniphila effectively reduces cognitive impairments and anxiety-related behavior, showing promise as an AD therapeutic by influencing the gut-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "To realize effective and long-term synergistic therapy of ulcerative colitis (UC) with probiotics, we developed gastrointestinal self-adaptive and nutrient self-sufficient Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK)-gelatin porous microgels (AKK@GPMGs). In AKK@GPMGs, AKK was covered with sequential layers of proanthocyanidins (PAs), mucin (MUC), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) to obtain AKK@PAs-MUC-PC (AKK@PMP), and then encapsulated within the methacrylate-modified gelatin porous microgels. AKK@GPMGs provide sufficient mucus as a nutrition source for AKK and boost resistance to stomach acid by 30.49-fold, and colonization in the intestines is enhanced by 83.46 times. The microgels can be dissociated by matrix metalloproteinase at the inflammatory sites of the intestine, and release AKK@PMP, which acts as \"band-aid\" that adheres to the inflamed colon for a long time and offers improved synergistic therapy for UC. Compared to uncoated AKK, AKK@GPMGs increase reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity by 26.47 times, improve the intestinal mucus layer thickness by 5.63 times, increase the goblet cells abundance by 3.93 times, reduce intestinal permeability by 5.60 times and significantly enhance beneficial gut microbiota while repressing harmful microbiota. These results indicate that AKK@GPMGs can restore mucus layer and tight junction integrity, reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, and regulate gut microbiota homeostasis to effectively treat intestinal inflammation.",

Although the gut microbiota is considered involved in the pathogenesis of LC, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Although the antibiotic, rifaximin (RFX), is effective for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) with LC, the impact of RFX on intestinal bacteria is unknown. We investigated the bacterial compositions along the GI tract under RFX treatment using a murine LC model. RFX improved liver fibrosis and hyperammonemia and altered the bacterial composition in the small intestine. The efficacy of RFX was associated with increases in specific bacterial genera, including Akkermansia. Administration of a commensal strain of Akkermansia muciniphila improved liver fibrosis and hyperammonemia with changing bacterial composition in the small intestine. This study proposed a new concept \"small intestine-liver axis\" in the pathophysiology of LC and oral A. muciniphila administration is a promising microbial intervention.",

Supplementation of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) has also been proven to be effective in the prevention and treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders. Here we found that AKK was more abundant in healthy control than ACVD patients via metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples. Subsequently, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of AKK on obesity-associated atherosclerosis. AKK intervention partially reversed the exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation in ApoE-/- mice by improving dyslipidemia. Interestingly, replenishment with AKK significantly enhanced cardiac function and reduced the body weight. It also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 in the circulation. Additionally, AKK colonization dramatically regulated gut microbiota and increased the abundance of Lactobacillaceae. Our findings have provided novel insights into the therapeutic potential of AKK as a beneficial microbe for treating atherosclerotic-associated cardiovascular diseases.",

We tested the hypothesis that Am extracellular vesicles (AmEVs) protect against hypertension through modulation of gene expression in the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Extracellular vesicles purified from anaerobically cultured Am (1.0 × 108 or 1.0 × 109 particles/kg) or vehicles were injected into the tail veins of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) and SHRs weekly for 4 weeks. Renal cortical tissues isolated from both rat strains were analyzed by trichrome stain and RT-qPCR. AmEVs protect against the development of hypertension in SHRs without a serious adverse reaction. AmEVs increased the expression of vasocontracting Agt and At1ar as well as vasodilating At2r, Mas1 and Nos2 in the kidneys of both strains. These results indicate that AmEVs have a protective effect against hypertension without a serious adverse reaction. Therefore, it is foreseen that AmEVs may be utilized as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of hypertension.",

This study indicated that some PCa patients and mice were more sensitive to ADT and entered CRPC later, which was related to the gut microbiota, especially the enrichment of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK). Untargeted metabolomics analysis found that serum inosine level was upregulated in the treatment-sensitive group and significantly correlated with AKK. Furthermore, we revealed that intestinal permeability and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels increased in treatment-resistant mice. LPS stimulated the upregulation of p-NF-κB p65 and AR in tumors. Supplementing AKK metabolite inosine could alleviate intestinal barrier damage and reduce serum LPS level, ultimately inhibiting castration resistance via the LPS/NF-κB/AR axis. Finally, we constructed a predictive model for CRPC combining gut microbiota and clinical information (AUC = 0.729). This study revealed the potential mechanism of gut microbiota on CRPC and provided potential therapeutic targets and prognostic indicators."

However, the mechanisms of Akkermansia muciniphila's action and its effects on the microbiome are not well understood. In this study, we examined the influence of A. muciniphila and its derivatives on gastrointestinal (GI) and metabolic disorders through a meta-analysis of studies conducted on mouse models. A total of 39 eligible studies were identified through targeted searches on PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Embase until May 2024. A. muciniphila (alive or heat-killed) and its derivatives positively affected systemic and gut inflammation, liver enzyme level, glycemic response, and lipid profiles. The intervention increased the expression of tight-junction proteins in the gut, improving gut permeability in mouse models of GI and metabolic disorders. Regarding body weight, A. muciniphila and its derivatives prevented weight loss in animals with GI disorders while reducing body weight in mice with metabolic disorders. Sub-group analysis indicated that live bacteria had a more substantial effect on most analyzed biomarkers. Gut microbiome analysis using live A. muciniphila identified a co-occurrence cluster, including Desulfovibrio, Family XIII AD3011 group, and Candidatus Saccharimonas. Thus, enhancing the intestinal abundance of A. muciniphila and its gut microbial clusters may provide more robust health benefits for cardiometabolic, and age-related diseases compared with A. muciniphila alone. The mechanistic insight elucidated here will pave the way for further exploration and potential translational applications in human health."

Gut microbiota is considered to be one of the important factors that maintain human health by regulating host metabolism. As an abundant bacterium in the host gut, A. muciniphila regulates metabolic and immune functions, and protects gut health. Multiple studies have indicated that alterations in the abundance of A. muciniphila are associated with various diseases, including intestinal inflammatory diseases, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and even parasitic diseases. Beneficial effects were observed not only in live A. muciniphila, but also in pasteurized A. muciniphila, A. muciniphila-derived extracellular vesicles, outer membrane, and secreted proteins. Although numerous studies have only proven the simple correlation between multiple diseases and A. muciniphila, an increasing number of studies in animal models and preclinical models have demonstrated that the beneficial impacts shifted from correlations to in-depth mechanisms. In this review, we provide a comprehensive view of the beneficial effects of A. muciniphila on different diseases and summarize the potential mechanisms of action of A. muciniphila in the treatment of diseases. We provide a comprehensive understanding of A. muciniphila for improving host health and discuss the perspectives of A. muciniphila in the future studies.",

In this study, gliadin-stimulated THP-1 derived MQs were treated with A. muciniphila and PBM to evaluate their effects on promoting the polarization of M2 MQs. Methods: The human monocyte cell line (THP-1) was differentiated to MQs. MQs were stimulated with 200 μg/mL gliadin for 24 hours and then treated with PBM 810 nm alone and in combination with A. muciniphila for the following 24 hours to evaluate their effects on MQs polarization. THP-1 derived MQs were also treated with PBM and A. muciniphila to evaluate their effects on non-stimulated MQs. CD11b, CD80, and CD206 levels were evaluated by using the flow cytometry technique. Moreover, the expression of some M1 and M2-related cytokines was determined. Results: PBM therapy of gliadin-stimulated MQs decreased IL-6 and increased TGF-β, IL-10 and TNF-α expression compared with gliadin exposed MQs. PBM along with A. muciniphila treatment induced IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 expression in MQs in comparison to the untreated group. It also elevated TGF-β, IL-10 and TNF-α levels in gliadin-triggered MQs in comparison to gliadin-stimulated MQ cells. Conclusion: The result of this study showed the potential of PBMT and A. muciniphila for modulating inflammatory responses and MQs polarization. This may open new perspectives to find possible therapeutic targets for celiac diseases."

This comprehensive approach can improve our understanding of A. muciniphila response to physical exercise and highlight gaps in the literature, providing valuable insights for future microbiome research. Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Sports Discuss) were searched in the literature. Quality assessment was conducted independently and in duplicate using two risk-of-bias tools (Downs and Black for human studies and SYRCLE's risk of bias for animal studies). 3,901 studies were identified, with thirteen human studies and nine animal studies included after screening. Of the thirteen human studies analysed, five (38.5%) were cross-sectional, seven (53.8%) were longitudinal/experimental, and one (7.7%) was a case study. These studies included 522 participants, among whom 157 were athletes, such as rugby players, marathon runners, triathletes, and skiers. Six studies reported an increase in A. muciniphila, five showed a decrease, and two found no significant differences. Regarding interventions, two studies used a combination of moderate-intensity strength and aerobic training, while seven used low to moderate-intensity aerobic exercises. In the nine rodent studies, eight (88.9%) were conducted on mice and one (11.1%) on rats, with all being experimental. These studies involved 310 animals. Eight studies reported a substantial increase in A. muciniphila, while one found no differences. Among these, eight employed moderate-intensity aerobic exercises as the intervention, and one utilised low-to-moderate-intensity strength training. The studies summarised in this review indicate that the impact of various physical exercise protocols on A. muciniphila abundance in humans remains controversial. However, rodent studies provide strong evidence that aerobic exercise increases A. muciniphila abundance in faecal pellets of both healthy and diseased models.",

In this study, we detected a significant increase of intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) following ischemic stroke by a rose bengal photothrombosis model. To investigate the function and mechanism of AKK on ischemic stroke, we performed the AKK administration prior to stroke surgery. The results showed that mice treated with AKK gained significantly higher body weight and behaved better than those in PBS group at 3 days after ischemic stroke. Consistently, AKK administration remarkably decreased the infarct volumes as well as the density of degenerating neurons and apoptotic cells after ischemic stroke. Notably, AKK is a potential therapeutic target in immune-related disorders connected to the microbiota, and inflammation is crucially involved in the pathophysiological process of ischemic stroke. For the determination of underlying mechanisms of this protective effect, we investigated whether there are associations between AKK and neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke. The results suggested that AKK administration significantly reduced the activation of astrocytes and microglia but up-regulated multiple anti-inflammatory factors following ischemic stroke. Therefore, our study highlighted the beneficial roles of intestinal AKK on ischemic stroke and provided a new perspective for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",

Akkermanisa muciniphila is an intestinal bacterium involved in anti-obesity and insulin resistance. Developing interventions to increase A. muciniphla would be useful for new treatment strategies. In this study, we screened herbal drug extracts that promoted the growth of A. muciniphila. Among the 123 herbal drugs, five herbal drug extracts significantly increased A. muciniphila DNA levels compared with that in controls. In particular, Dioscoreae rhizoma extract increased the growth of A. muciniphila in the intestines of mice fed a high-fat diet and improved obesity. It significantly reduced body weight gain, improved glucose tolerance even when the administration was initiated after the induction of dietary obesity. These results suggest that herbal drug extracts, such as Dioscoreae rhizome, that increase A. muciniphila could be a new therapeutic strategy for metabolic syndrome.

      "abstract": "Intestinal barriers play a crucial role in human physiology, both in homeostatic and pathological conditions. Disruption of the intestinal barrier is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. The profound influence of the gut microbiota on intestinal diseases has sparked considerable interest in manipulating it through dietary interventions, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as potential approaches to enhance the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Numerous studies have underscored the protective effects of specific microbiota and their associated metabolites. In recent years, an increasing body of research has demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila, Am) plays a beneficial role in various diseases, including diabetes, obesity, aging, cancer, and metabolic syndrome. It is gaining popularity as a regulator that influences the intestinal flora and intestinal barrier and is recognized as a 'new generation of probiotics'. Consequently, it may represent a potential target and promising therapy option for intestinal diseases. This article systematically summarizes the role of Am in the gut. Specifically, we carefully discuss key scientific issues that need resolution in the future regarding beneficial bacteria represented by Am, which may provide insights for the application of drugs targeting Am in clinical treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of Liangxue Guyuan Yishen Decoction (LGYD), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been scientifically proven in the treatment of radiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII) and preservation of intestinal integrity and function following high-dose radiation exposure. However, further investigation is required to comprehensively elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of LGYD in order to provide potential pharmaceutical options for radiation protection. PURPOSE: This study aims to elucidate the potential mechanism through which LGYD exerts its therapeutic effects on RIII by modulating the gut microbiota (GM). METHODS: 16 s rRNA analysis was employed to assess the impact of varying doses of whole body irradiation (WBI) on GM in order to establish an appropriate model for this study. The effects of LGYD on GM and SCFA were evaluated using 16 s rRNA and Quantification of SCFA. UHPLC-QE-MS was utilized to identify the active components in LGYD as well as LGYD drug containing serum (LGYD-DS). Subsequently, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining were conducted to validate the influence of LGYD and/or characteristic microbiota on RIII recovery in vivo. The effects of LGYD-DS, characteristic flora, and SCFA on intestinal stem cell (ISC) were assessed by measuring organoid surface area in intestinal organoid model. RESULTS: The species composition and abundance of GM were significantly influenced by whole-body irradiation with a dose of 8.5 Gy, which was used as in vivo model. LGYD significantly improves the survival rate and promotes recovery from RIII. Additionally, LGYD exhibited a notable increase in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) and levels of SCFA, particularly isobutyric acid. LGYD-DS consisted of seven main components derived from herbs of LGYD. In vivo experiments indicated that both LGYD and AKK substantially enhanced the survival rate after radiation and facilitated the recovery process for intestinal structure and function. In the organoid model, treatment with LGYD-DS, AKK supernatant or isobutyric acid significantly increased organoid surface area. CONCLUSIONS: LGYD has the potential to enhance RIII by promoting the restoration of intestinal stem cell, which is closely associated with the upregulation of AKK abundance and production of SCFA, particularly isobutyric acid.",

Our study focused on the factors and molecular mechanisms of AKK affecting immune escape in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We cultured AKK bacteria, prepared AKK outer membrane protein Amuc_1100 and constructed a subcutaneous graft tumour mouse model. A549, NCI-H1395 cells and mice were respectively treated with inactivated AKK, Amuc_1100, Ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor) and RO8191 (JAK activator). CD8+ T cells that penetrated the membrane were counted in the Transwell assay. The toxicity of CD8+ T cells was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase assay. Western blot was applied to determine JAK/STAT-related protein and PD-L1 expression, whilst CCL5, granzyme B and INF-γ expression were assessed through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The proportion of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and the levels of granzyme B and INF-γ were determined by flow cytometry. AKK markedly accelerated A549 and NCI-H1395 recruiting CD8+ T cells and enhanced CD8+ T cell toxicity. Amuc_1100 purified from AKK exerted the same promoting effects. Besides, Amuc_1100 dramatically suppressed PD-L1, p-STAT and p-JAK expression and enhanced CCL5, granzyme B and INF-γ expression. Treatment with Ruxolitinib accelerated A549 and NCI-H1395 cells recruiting CD8+ T cells, enhanced CD8+ T cell toxicity, CCL5, granzyme B and INF-γ expression, and inhibited PD-L1 expression. In contrast, the RO8191 treatment slowed down the changes induced by Amuc_1100. Animal experiments showed that Amuc_1100 was found to increase the number of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, increase the levels of granzyme B and INF-γ and significantly inhibit the expression of PD-L1, p-STAT and p-JAK, which exerted an antitumour effect in vivo. In conclusion, through inhibiting the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, AKK outer membrane protein facilitated the recruitment of CD8+ T cells in LUAD and suppressed the immune escape of cells.",

In addition, the safety of this strain was further evaluated by toxicological studies. The results showed that the AKK ONE genome is contained on a single chromosome with a total length of 2,817,524 bp and an average GC content of 55.48%. In total, 2411, 1131, 1168, 1745, and 1402 genes were annotated to the NR, GO, KEGG, COG, and SwissProt database, respectively. Potential resistance genes, adeF, tetW, ANT(3″)-IIa, and aadA1 were detected. AKK ONE was sensitive to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, meropenem, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol and resistant to moxifloxacin. No potential virulence-related genes were detected. The PathogenFinder database analysis showed that AKK ONE was a non-potential human pathogen. This strain had good gastroenteric fluid tolerance and a weak ability to colonize the gut. No test item-related adverse effects were observed in the acute and subchronic toxicity test. AKK ONE did not display mutagenic activity either. This strain did not change the hematological and clinical biochemical parameters of mice. The weights of the organs were not affected by AKK ONE treatment. These results support that AKK ONE is safe for use as a probiotic at a dose of 8.28 × 109 CFU/kg bw/day."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota dysbiosis significantly contributes to progression of depression. Hypericum perforatum L. (HPL) is traditionally used in Europe for treating depression. However, its mechanism remains largely underexplored. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the pivotal gut microbiota species and microbial signaling metabolites associated with the antidepressant effects of HPL. METHODS: Fecal microbiota transplantation was used to assess whether HPL mitigates depression through alterations in gut microbiota. Microbiota and metabolic profiling of control, chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced depression, and HPL-treated CRS mice were examined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis. The influence of gut microbiota on HPL's antidepressant effects was assessed by metabolite and bacterial intervention experiments. RESULTS: HPL significantly alleviated depression symptoms in a manner dependent on gut microbiota and restored gut microbial composition by enriching Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK). Metabolomic analysis indicated that HPL regulated tryptophan metabolism, reducing kynurenine (KYN) levels derived from microbiota and increasing 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) levels. Notably, supplementation with KYN activated the NFκB-NLRP2-Caspase1-IL1β pathway and increased proinflammatory IL1β in the hippocampus of mice with depression. Interestingly, mono-colonization with AKK notably increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and decreased KYN levels, ameliorating depression symptoms through modulation of the NFκB-NLRP2-Caspase1-IL1β pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The promising therapeutic role of HPL in treating depression is primarily attributed to its regulation of the NFκB-NLRP2-Caspase1-IL1β pathway, specifically by targeting AKK and tryptophan metabolites.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has proved the close association between alterations in gut microbiota and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the potential roles of gut microbiota in regulating oxaliplatin sensitivity in gastric cancer (GC) have not been investigated before. We first found that antibiotic treatment diminished the therapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin in a GC mouse model. Importantly, this effect could be transmitted to germ-free mice via fecal microbiota transplantation, indicating a potential role of gut microbiota modulation in oxaliplatin efficacy. Further, metagenomics data showed that Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) ranked first among the bacterial species with decreased relative abundances after antibiotic treatment. Metabolically active A. muciniphila promotes oxaliplatin efficacy. As shown by metabolomics analysis, the metabolic pattern of gut microbiota was disrupted with significantly downregulated levels of pentadecanoic acid (PEA), and the use of PEA significantly promoted oxaliplatin efficacy. Mechanistically, FUBP1 positively regulated aerobic glycolysis of GC cells to hinder the therapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin. A. muciniphila-derived PEA functioned as an inhibitory factor of glycolysis by directly antagonizing the activity of FUBP1, which potentiated GC responses to oxaliplatin. Our research suggested a key role for intestinal A. muciniphila and its metabolite PEA in promoting oxaliplatin efficacy, thus providing a new perspective for probiotic and prebiotic intervention in GC patients during chemotherapy.",

A. muciniphila, known for its ability to reside in the mucous layer of the intestine, plays a pivotal role in maintaining gut integrity and interacting with host metabolic processes. Its influence extends to modulating immune responses and potentially easing symptoms across several non-communicable diseases, including obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Recent studies highlight its capacity to interact with the gut-brain axis, suggesting a possible impact on neuropsychiatric conditions. Despite the promising therapeutic potential of A. muciniphila highlighted in animal and preliminary human studies, challenges remain in its practical application due to stability and cultivation issues. However, the development of pasteurized forms and synthetic mediums offers new avenues for its use in clinical settings, as recognized by regulatory bodies like the European Food Safety Authority. This narrative review serves as a crucial resource for understanding the broad implications of A. muciniphila across different health conditions and its potential integration into therapeutic strategies.",

It has shown the potential of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) in improving metabolic disorders and exerting anti-inflammatory effects. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the specific effects and mechanisms underlying the treatment of DCI with A. muciniphila. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of A. muciniphila in alleviating DCI in db/db mice. Eleven-week-old db/db mice were administered either live or pasteurized A. muciniphila (5 × 109 CFU/200 μL) for a duration of eight weeks. Administering live A. muciniphila significantly ameliorated cognitive impairments, improved the synaptic ultrastructure, and inhibited hippocampal neuron loss in the CA1 and CA3 subregions in db/db mice. Both live and pasteurized A. muciniphila effectively mitigated neuroinflammation. Moreover, live A. muciniphila increased the relative abundance of Lactococcus and Staphylococcus, whereas pasteurized A. muciniphila increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_UCG_001, and Alistipes. Supplementation of A. muciniphila also induced alterations in serum and brain metabolites, with a particular enrichment observed in tryptophan metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions. Correlation analysis further demonstrated a direct and substantial correlation between the altered gut microbiota and the metabolites in the serum and brain tissue. In conclusion, the results indicate that live A. muciniphila demonstrated greater efficacy compared to pasteurized A. muciniphila. The observed protective effects of A. muciniphila against DCI are likely mediated through the neuroinflammation and microbiota-metabolites-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "The use of next-generation probiotics (NGP) in pigs for combating diseases has been subject to limited research. Here we explored the potential of a well-known NGP candidate Akkermansia muciniphila targeting pig gut health. In the first screening experiment, we found that the abundance of A. muciniphila peaked at 14 d old but decreased at weaning (21 d old; P < 0.05), suggesting the weaning period may be an effective window for A. muciniphila intervention. Following that, 48 crossbred weaned pigs at 28 d old were randomly assigned to five groups: control (CON), high/low live A. muciniphila (HA/LA), and high/low heat-killed A. muciniphila (HIA/LIA). From 1 to 28 d old, the CON group received gastric infusion of anaerobic sterile saline every other day; the HA and LA groups were gavaged every other day with 1 × 1010 CFU/5 mL and 5 × 108 CFU/5 mL live A. muciniphila, respectively; and the HIA and LIA groups were gavaged every other day with 1 × 1010 CFU/5 mL and 5 × 108 CFU/5 mL heat-killed A. muciniphila, respectively. At d 29, pigs in the CON group were randomly and equally divided into two groups, one of which was named the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) group, and all groups except CON received a 5-d ETEC challenge. The supplementation of A. muciniphila numerically reduced the diarrhea rate of weaned pigs compared to the pigs that only received the ETEC challenge (P = 0.57), but the LIA group had a higher diarrhea rate than the CON group (P < 0.05). Consistent with this, the supplementation of A. muciniphila improved the small intestinal morphology and structure, proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes in the blood, as well as the expression of genes related to intestinal barrier and antioxidant indices of pigs with ETEC challenge, especially for the LA group (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, A. muciniphila supplementation reduced the expression of ETEC virulence factor genes in the ileum and colon of pigs challenged by ETEC (P < 0.05). Therefore, A. muciniphila may protect the intestinal health of weaned piglets from damage caused by ETEC infection, but the effect may vary depending on the concentration and activity of A. muciniphila."

Recent studies mainly focus on the effect of A. muciniphila on obesity and insulin resistance, but there is no research on the effect of A. muciniphila on pancreatic β-cell function and its mechanism in prediabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of A. muciniphila on β-cell function, apoptosis and differentiation, as well as its effects on the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier, metaflammation and the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced prediabetic rat model. The effect of A. muciniphila was compared with dietary intervention. The results showed both A. muciniphila treatment and dietary intervention can reduce metaflammation by repairing the intestinal barrier in rats with prediabetes induced by an HFD and improve β-cell secretory function, apoptosis and differentiation through signaling pathways mediated by TLR2 and TLR4. Additionally, A. muciniphila can further elevate β-cell secretion, attenuate apoptosis and improve differentiation and the TLR signaling pathway on the basis of diet."

GLP-1 is a key regulator of energy metabolism and food intake. It has been proven that P9 protein from A. muciniphila could increase GLP-1 release and improve glucose homeostasis in HFD-induced mice. To obtain an engineered Lactococcus lactis which produced P9 protein, mature polypeptide chain of P9 was codon-optimized, fused with N-terminal signal peptide Usp45, and expressed in L. lactis NZ9000. Heterologous secretion of P9 by recombinant L. lactis NZP9 were successfully detected by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Notably, the supernatant of L. lactis NZP9 stimulated GLP-1 production of NCI-H716 cells. The relative expression level of GLP-1 biosynthesis gene GCG and PCSK1 were upregulated by 1.63 and 1.53 folds, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the secretory expression of carboxyl-terminal processing protease P9 from A. muciniphila in L. lactis. Our results suggest that genetically engineered L. lactis which expressed P9 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and other metabolic disorders.",

However, few studies have reported that probiotics can specifically modulate individual gut microbes. This study demonstrated that administering the probiotic, Lactiplantibacillus fermentum F6, could ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in a rat model, evidenced by the decreases in the disease activity index score, histopathology grading, and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, as well as the increase in the serum anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. Shotgun metagenomics revealed that the fecal metagenomic of colitis rats receiving the probiotic intervention contained substantially fewer Akkermansia muciniphila than the dextran sulfate sodium group. Thus, the probiotic mechanism might be exerted by reducing specific gut microbial species associated with disease pathogenesis. A new paradigm for designing probiotics that manage diseases through direct and precise manipulation of gut microbes has been provided through this study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is exacerbated by disruptions in intestinal microecology and immune imbalances within the gut-liver axis. The present study assesses the therapeutic potential of combining Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) with inosine in alleviating alcohol-induced liver injury. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice, subjected to a Lieber-DeCarli diet with 5% alcohol for 4 weeks, served as the alcoholic liver injury model. Various analyzes, including quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), ELISA, immunochemistry, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and flow cytometry, were employed to evaluate liver injury parameters, intestinal barrier function, microbiota composition, and immune responses. RESULTS: Compared to the model group, the A. muciniphila and inosine groups exhibited significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, reduced hepatic fat deposition and neutrophil infiltration, alleviated oxidative stress and inflammation, and increased expression of intestinal tight junction proteins (Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1). These effects were further pronounced in the A. muciniphila and inosine combination group compared to individual treatments. While alcohol feeding induced intestinal dysbiosis and gut barrier disruption, the combined treatment reduced the abundance of harmful bacteria (Oscillibacter, Escherichia/Shigella, and Alistipes) induced by alcohol consumption, promoting the growth of butyrate-producing bacteria (Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium IV). Flow cytometry revealed that alcohol consumption reduced T regulatory (Treg) populations while increasing those of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17, which were restored by A. muciniphila combined with inosine treatment. Moreover, A. muciniphila and inosine combination increased the expression levels of intestinal CD39, CD73, and adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) along with enhanced proportions of CD4+CD39+Treg and CD4+CD73+Treg cells in the liver and spleen. The A2AR antagonist KW6002, blocked the beneficial effects of the A. muciniphila and inosine combination on liver injury in ALD mice. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that the combination of A. muciniphila and inosine holds promise for ameliorating ALD by enhancing the gut ecosystem, improving intestinal barrier function, upregulating A2AR, CD73, and CD39 expression, modulating Treg cells functionality, and regulating the imbalance of Treg/Th17/Th1 cells, and these beneficial effects are partly A2AR-dependent."

      "abstract": "Obesity and metabolic dysfunction have been shown to be associated with overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which contributes to dysbiosis or imbalances in the gut microbiota. Recently, the reversal of dysbiosis has been observed as a result of dietary supplementation with antioxidative compounds including polyphenols. Likewise, dietary polyphenols have been associated with scavenging of GI ROS, leading to the hypothesis that radical scavenging in the GI tract is a potential mechanism for the reversal of dysbiosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between GI ROS, dietary antioxidants and beneficial gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila. The results of this study demonstrated A. muciniphila to be a discriminant microorganism between lean (n = 7) and obese (n = 7) mice. The relative abundance of A. muciniphila was also found to have a significant negative correlation with extracellular ROS in the GI tract as measured using fluorescent probe hydroindocyanine green. The ability of the dietary antioxidants ascorbic acid, β-carotene and grape polyphenols to scavenge GI ROS was evaluated in tandem with their ability to support A. muciniphila bloom in lean mice (n = 20). While the relationship between GI ROS and relative abundance of A. muciniphila was conserved in lean mice, only grape polyphenols stimulated the bloom of A. muciniphila. Analysis of fecal antioxidant capacity and differences in the bioavailability of the antioxidants of interest suggested that the poor bioavailability of grape polyphenols contributes to their superior radical scavenging activity and support of A. muciniphila in comparison to the other compounds tested. These findings demonstrate the utility of the GI redox environment as a modifiable therapeutic target in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases like metabolic syndrome."

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may represent potential strategies for Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. Our previous research revealed a decreased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk) in PD mice; however, whether Akk is beneficial to PD is unknown. To answer this question, the mice received MPTP intraperitoneally to construct a subacute model of PD and were then supplemented with Akk orally for 21 consecutive days. Motor function, dopaminergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis were examined. In addition, intestinal inflammation, and serum and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analyses, were assessed. We found that Akk treatment effectively inhibited the reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and partially improved the motor function in PD mice. Additionally, Akk markedly alleviated neuroinflammation in the striatum and hippocampus and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis. It also decreased the level of colon inflammation. Furthermore, these aforementioned changes are mainly accompanied by alterations in serum and fecal isovaleric acid levels, and lower intestinal permeability. Our research strongly suggests that Akk is a potential neuroprotective agent for PD therapy."

We tested the hypothesis that Am extracellular vesicles (AmEVs) have a protective effect against hypertension. Extracellular vesicles purified from anaerobically cultured Am were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and silver stain after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). AmEVs (1.0 × 1010 log particles/L) or vehicles were added into organ baths to induce vasorelaxation. In addition, AmEVs (1.0 × 108 or 1.0 × 109 particles/kg) or vehicles were injected into the tail veins of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) weekly for 4 weeks. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and splenocytes isolated from both rat strains were analyzed by flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, and western blot. AmEVs affected neither vascular contraction nor endothelial relaxation in thoracic aortas. Moreover, AmEVs protected against the development of hypertension in SHRs without a serious adverse reaction. Additionally, AmEVs increased the population of T regulatory (Treg) cells and tended to reduce proinflammatory cytokines. These results indicate that AmEVs have a protective effect against hypertension without a serious adverse reaction. Therefore, it is foreseen that AmEVs may be utilized as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis is a common type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects millions of individuals around the world. Traditional UC treatment has focused on suppressing immune responses rather than treating the underlying causes of UC, which include oxidative stress, inflammation, and microbiota dysbiosis. Diosmin (DIO), a naturally occurring flavonoid, possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of DIO in treating dextran-sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and to investigate some of its underlying mechanisms, with an emphasis on Akkermansia muciniphila abundance, inflammatory markers, and intestinal barrier function. C57BL/6 mice were given 4% (w/v) DSS to induce colitis. DSS-induced mice were administered DIO (100 and 200 mg/kg) or sulfasalazine orally for 7 days. Every day, the disease activity index (DAI) was determined by recording body weight, diarrhea, and bloody stool. Changes in fecal A. muciniphila abundance, colonic MUC1 and MUC2 expression, as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were all assessed. Histopathological changes, colonic PIK3PR3 and ZO-1 levels, and immunohistochemical examinations of occludin and claudin-1, were investigated. DIO administration resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in DAI, as well as increase in A. muciniphila abundance and MUC2 expression while decreasing MUC1 expression. DIO also dramatically reduced colonic oxidative stress and inflammation by regulating the NF-κB and Nrf2 cascades, restored intestinal barrier integrity by inhibiting PIK3R3 and inducing ZO-1, and improved occludin/claudin-1 gene expression and immunostaining. This study provides the first evidence that DIO preserves intestinal barrier integrity and increases A. muciniphila abundance in DSS-induced colitis. However, more research is required to explore the impact of DIO on the overall composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Likewise, it will be important to fully understand the molecular mechanisms by which A. muciniphila maintains intestinal barrier function and its potential use as an adjuvant in the treatment of UC."

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most cancer-related death worldwide. In recent years, probiotics have been used to reduce the potential risks of CRC and tumors with various mechanisms. Different bacteria have been suggested to play different roles in the progression, prevention, or treatment of CRC. Akkermansia muciniphila is considered a next-generation probiotic for preventing and treating some diseases. Therefore, in this review article, we aimed to describe and discuss different mechanisms of A. muciniphila as an intestinal microbiota or probiotic in CRC. Some studies suggested that the abundance of A. muciniphila was higher or increased in CRC patients compared to healthy individuals. However, the decreased abundance of A. muciniphila was associated with severe symptoms of CRC, indicating that A. muciniphila did not play a role in the development of CRC. In addition, A. muciniphila administration elevates gene expression of proliferation-associated molecules such as S100A9, Dbf4, and Snrpd1, or markers for cell proliferation. Some other studies suggested that inflammation and tumorigenesis in the intestine might promoted by A. muciniphila. Overall, the role of A. muciniphila in CRC development or inhibition is still unclear and controversial. Various methods of bacterial supplementation, such as viability, bacterial number, and abundance, could all influence the colonization effect of A. muciniphila administration and CRC progression. Overall, A. mucinipila has been revealed to modulate the therapeutic potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Preliminary human data propose that oral consumption of A. muciniphila is safe, but its efficacy needs to be confirmed in more human clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "Second-generation antipsychotics are mainly used in both acute and long-term treatment of major psychiatric disorders. Although better tolerated than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, they can frequently induce weight gain and metabolic disorders, of these, olanzapine is one of the drugs more likely to induce these side effects. There is consistent evidence of the role of gut microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis with complex crosstalk with the host involving satiety signaling pathways, food intake behavior, and weight and metabolic regulation. Second-generation antipsychotics induce important gut microbiota modification thus contributing together with the central and peripheral receptors blockade mechanism to weight gain induction and metabolic impairment. These drugs can alter the composition of gut microbiota and induce dysbiosis, often reducing the concentration of Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacterium that is also decreased in patients with diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or chronic inflammatory diseases. Probiotic administration can be a safe and well-tolerated approach to modulate microbiota and offer an integrative strategy in psychiatric patients suffering antipsychotic side effects. Multiple strain probiotics and Akkermansia muciniphila alone have been administered both in mice models and in clinical populations demonstrating efficacy on antipsychotic-induced metabolic impairment and showing a contribution in reducing induced weight gain. Akkermansia muciniphila can improve several parameters altered by olanzapine administration, such as weight gain, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, liver function, systemic inflammation, and gut barrier function. Although we do not have jet trials in the psychiatric population, this probiotic may be a complementary approach to treating olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic side effects."

      "abstract": "Emerging research suggests that exposures to metals during pregnancy and gut microbiome (GM) disruptions are associated with depressive disorders in childhood. Akkermansia muciniphila, a GM bacteria, has been studied for its potential antidepressant effects. However, its role in the influence of prenatal metal exposures on depressive symptoms during childhood is unknown. Leveraging a well-characterized pediatric longitudinal birth cohort and its microbiome substudy (n=112) and using a state-of-the-art machine-learning model, we investigated whether the presence of A.muciniphila in GM of 9-11-year-olds modifies the associations between exposure to a specific group of metals (or metal-clique) during pregnancy and concurrent childhood depressive symptoms. Among children with no A.muciniphila, a metal-clique of Zinc-Chromium-Cobalt was strongly associated with increased depression score (P<0.0001), whereas, for children with A.muciniphila, this same metal-clique was weakly associated with decreased depression score(P<0.4). Our analysis provides the first exploratory evidence hypothesizing A. muciniphila as a probiotic intervention attenuating the effect of prenatal metal-exposures-associated depressive disorders in late childhood."

A. muciniphila is a promising next-generation probiotic with clinical application prospects. Emerging studies have reported various beneficial effects of A. muciniphila including anti-cancer, delaying aging, reducing inflammation, improving immune function, regulating nervous system function, whereas knowledge on its roles and mechanism in infectious disease is currently unclear. In this review, we summarized the basic characteristics, genome and phenotype diversity, the influence of A. muciniphila and its derived components on infectious diseases, such as sepsis, virus infection, enteric infection, periodontitis and foodborne pathogen induced infections. We also provided updates on mechanisms how A. muciniphila protects intestinal barrier integrity and modulate host immune response. In summary, we believe that A. muciniphila is a promising therapeutic probiotic that may be applied for the treatment of a variety of infectious diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic diseases that are not fully understood. Drugs in use can only be applied for a short time due to their side effects. Therefore, research is needed to develop new treatment approaches. In addition, it has been proven that IBD causes degeneration in the enteric nervous system (ENS). In recent years, it has been discussed that probiotics may have positive effects in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory enteric degeneration. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is an anaerobic bacterium found in the mucin layer of the intestinal microbiota. It has been found that the population of A. muciniphila decreases in the case of different diseases. In light of this information, the curative effect of A. muciniphila application on colitis-induced inflammation and enteric degeneration was investigated. METHODS: In this study, 5 weeks of A. muciniphila treatment in Trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced chronic colitis model was investigated. Colon samples were examined at microscopic, biochemical, and molecular levels. Fecal samples were collected before, during, and after treatment to evaluate the population changes in the microbiota. Specific proteins secreted from the ENS were evaluated, and enteric degeneration was examined. RESULTS: As a result of the research, the ameliorative effects of A. muciniphila were shown in the TNBS colitis model-induced inflammation and ENS damage. DISCUSSION: In light of these results, A. muciniphila can potentially be evaluated as a microbiome-based treatment for IBD with further clinical and experimental studies.",

      "abstract": "Gut - brain communications disorders in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with intestinal microbiota composition, increased gut permeability, and psychosocial disturbances. Symptoms of IBS are difficult to medicate, and hence much research is being made into alternative approaches. This study assesses the potential of a treatment with pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila for alleviating IBS-like symptoms in two mouse models of IBS with different etiologies. Two clinically relevant animal models were used to mimic IBS-like symptoms in C57BL6/J mice: the neonatal maternal separation (NMS) paradigm and the Citrobacter rodentium infection model. In both models, gut permeability, colonic sensitivity, fecal microbiota composition and colonic IL-22 expression were evaluated. The cognitive performance and emotional state of the animals were also assessed by several tests in the C. rodentium infection model. The neuromodulation ability of pasteurized A. muciniphila was assessed on primary neuronal cells from mice dorsal root ganglia using a ratiometric calcium imaging approach. The administration of pasteurized A. muciniphila significantly reduced colonic hypersensitivity in both IBS mouse models, accompanied by a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier function. Beneficial effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila treatment have also been observed on anxiety-like behavior and memory defects in the C. rodentium infection model. Finally, a neuroinhibitory effect exerted by pasteurized A. muciniphila was observed on neuronal cells stimulated with two algogenic substances such as capsaicin and inflammatory soup. Our findings demonstrate novel anti-hyperalgesic and neuroinhibitory properties of pasteurized A. muciniphila, which therefore may have beneficial effects in relieving pain and anxiety in subjects with IBS.",

      "abstract": "Akkermansia muciniphila is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, which represents a part of the commensal human microbiota. Decline in the abundance of A. muciniphila among other microbial species in the gut correlates with severe systemic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer. Due to its mucin-reducing and immunomodulatory properties, the use of probiotics containing Akkermansia sp. appears as a promising approach to the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory diseases. In particular, a number of studies have focused on the role of A. muciniphila in colorectal cancer. Of note, the results of these studies in mice are contradictory: some reported a protective role of A. muciniphila in colorectal cancer, while others demonstrated that administration of A. muciniphila could aggravate the course of the disease resulting in increased tumor burden. More recent studies suggested the immunomodulatory effect of certain unique surface antigens of A. muciniphila on the intestinal immune system. In this Perspective, we attempt to explain how A. muciniphila contributes to protection against colorectal cancer in some models, while being pathogenic in others. We argue that differences in the experimental protocols of administration of A. muciniphila, as well as viability of bacteria, may significantly affect the results. In addition, we hypothesize that antigens presented by pasteurized bacteria or live A. muciniphila may exert distinct effects on the barrier functions of the gut. Finally, A. muciniphila may reduce the mucin barrier and exerts combined effects with other bacterial species in either promoting or inhibiting cancer development.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal dysbiosis frequently occurs in abdominal radiotherapy and contributes to irradiation (IR)-induced intestinal damage and inflammation. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is a recently characterized probiotic, which is critical for maintaining the dynamics of the intestinal mucus layer and preserving intestinal microbiota homeostasis. However, the role of A. muciniphila in the alleviation of radiation enteritis remains unknown. In this study, we reported that the abundance of A. muciniphila was markedly reduced in the intestines of mice exposed to abdominal IR and in the feces of patients who received abdominal radiotherapy. Abundance of A. muciniphila in feces of radiotherapy patients was negatively correlated with the duration of diarrhea in patients. Administration of A. muciniphila substantially mitigated IR-induced intestinal damage and prevented mouse death. Analyzing the metabolic products of A. muciniphila revealed that propionic acid, a short-chain fatty acid secreted by the microbe, mediated the radioprotective effect. We further demonstrated that propionic acid bound to G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GRP43) on the surface of intestinal epithelia and increased histone acetylation and hence enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1 and elevated the level of mucins, leading to enhanced integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier and reduced radiation-induced intestinal damage. Metformin, a first-line agent for the treatment of type II diabetes, promoted intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and reduced radiation intestinal damage through increasing the abundance of A. muciniphila. Together, our results demonstrated that A. muciniphila plays a critical role in the reduction of abdominal IR-induced intestinal damage. Application of probiotics or their regulators, such as metformin, could be an effective treatment for the protection of radiation exposure-damaged intestine.",

However, the patient response rates remain suboptimal, and a significant proportion of initial responders may develop resistance to this therapeutic approach. Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), a microorganism implicated in multiple human diseases, has been reported to be more abundant in patients who exhibit favorable responses to PD-1mAb. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. In our study, we found that AKK could enhance the efficacy of PD-1mAb against HCC in a tumor-bearing mouse model. It promotes HCC tumor cells apoptosis and raise the CD8+ T proportion in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, AKK downregulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. Furthermore, the analysis of metabonomics demonstrates that AKK induces alterations in the host's bile acid metabolism, leading to a significant increase in serum TUDCA levels. Considering the immunosuppresive roles of TUDCA in HCC development, it is plausible to speculate that AKK may reinforce the immunotherapy of PD-1mAb against HCC through its impact on bile acid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astaxanthin (AST) is a natural compound with anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory properties that has been found to have probiotic properties. However, the role and mechanism of AST in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) are still not fully understood. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of AST on CP/CPPS and elucidate the mediating role of the gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experimental autoimmune prostatitis (EAP) mouse model was utilized to test the potential role of AST on CP/CPPS. Antibiotic cocktail (ABX) treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) were used to elucidate the gut microbiota-mediated effects on AST. In addition, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qRT-PCR analyses were used to analyze changes in the gut microbiota of EAP mice and CP/CPPS patients. Finally, the mechanism by which AST exerts a protective effect on CP/CPPS was explored by untargeted metabolomics and gut barrier function assays. RESULTS: Oral administration of AST reduced prostate inflammation scores, alleviated tactile sensitization of the pelvic region in EAP mice, reduced CD4+ T cell and CD68+ macrophage infiltration in the prostatic interstitium, and inhibited the up-regulation of systemic and localized pain/pro-inflammatory mediators in the prostate. After ABX, the protective effect of AST against CP/CPPS was attenuated, whereas colonization with fecal bacteria from AST-treated EAP mice alleviated CP/CPPS. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qRT-PCR analyses showed that Akkermansia muciniphila in the feces of EAP mice and CP/CPPS patients showed a trend toward a decrease, which was associated with poor progression of CP/CPPS. In contrast, oral administration of AST increased the relative abundance of A. muciniphila, and oral supplementation with A. muciniphila also alleviated inflammation and pain in EAP mice. Finally, we demonstrated that both AST and A. muciniphila interventions increased serum levels of SCFAs acetate, up-regulated expression of colonic tight junction markers, and decreased serum lipopolysaccharide levels in EAP mice. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that AST improved CP/CPPS by up-regulating A. muciniphila, which provides new potentially effective strategies and ideas for CP/CPPS management.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent disease. It has been observed that the incidence and prevalence of IBD are increasing, which consequently raises the risk of developing colon cancer. Recently, the regulation of the intestinal barrier by probiotics has become an effective treatment for colitis. Akkermansia muciniphila-derived extracellular vesicles (Akk EVs) are nano-vesicles that contain multiple bioactive macromolecules with the potential to modulate the intestinal barrier. In this study, we used ultrafiltration in conjunction with high-speed centrifugation to extract Akk EVs. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cell model was established to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of Akk EVs. It was found that Akk EVs were able to be absorbed by RAW264.7 cells and significantly reduce the expression of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α, and IL-1β (p < 0.05). We explored the preventative effects on colitis and the regulating effects on the intestinal barrier using a mouse colitis model caused by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The findings demonstrated that Akk EVs effectively prevented colitis symptoms and reduced colonic tissue injury. Additionally, Akk EVs significantly enhanced the effectiveness of the intestinal barrier by elevating the expression of MUC2 (0.53 ± 0.07), improving mucus integrity, and reducing intestinal permeability (p < 0.05). Moreover, Akk EVs increased the proportion of the beneficial bacteria Firmicutes (33.01 ± 0.09%) and downregulated the proportion of the harmful bacteria Proteobacteria (0.32 ± 0.27%). These findings suggest that Akk EVs possess the ability to regulate immune responses, protect intestinal barriers, and modulate the gut microbiota. The research presents a potential intervention approach for Akk EVs to prevent colitis.",

To investigate, we used C57BL/6 J mice divided into five groups: Sham, POCD, POCD+Akk, POCD+Evs, and POCD+Evs + PLX5622. POCD was induced through intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The mice's cognitive function was assessed using behavioral tests, and possible mechanisms were explored by examining gut and BBB permeability, inflammation, and microglial function. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4 pathway-related proteins were also investigated both in vitro and in vivo. PLX5622 chow was employed to eliminate microglial cells. Our findings revealed a negative correlation between AKK abundance and POCD symptoms. Supplementation with either AKK or AmEvs improved cognitive function, improved the performance of the intestinal barrier and BBB, and decreased inflammation and microglial activation in POCD mice compared to controls. Moreover, AmEvs treatment inhibited TLR2/4 signaling in the brains of POCD mice and LPS-treated microglial cells. In microglial-ablated POCD mice, however, AmEvs failed to protect BBB integrity. Overall, AmEvs is a potential therapeutic strategy for managing POCD by enhancing gut and BBB integrity and inhibiting microglial-mediated TLR2/4 signaling.",

      "abstract": "Gut microbiota are closely related to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) maintains the intestinal barrier function and regulates the balance of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione. However, it may be useful as a treatment strategy for LPS-induced lung injury. Our study aimed to explore whether A. muciniphila could improve lung injury by affecting the gut microbiota. The administration of A. muciniphila effectively attenuated lung injury tissue damage and significantly decreased the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction induced by LPS, with lower levels of myeloperoxidase (MDA), enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and reduced macrophage and neutrophil infiltration. Moreover, A. muciniphila maintained the intestinal barrier function, reshaped the disordered microbial community, and promoted the secretion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). A. muciniphila significantly downregulated the expression of TLR2, MyD88 and NF-kappa B (P < 0.05). Butyrate supplementation demonstrated a significant improvement in the inflammatory response (P < 0.05) and mitigation of histopathological damage in mice with ALI, thereby restoring the intestinal butyric acid concentration. In conclusion, our findings indicate that A. muciniphila inhibits the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines and attenuates the activation of the TLR2/Myd88/NF-κB pathway due to exerting anti-inflammatory effects through butyrate. This study provides an experimental foundation for the potential application of A. muciniphila and butyrate in the prevention and treatment of ALI.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is frequently induced by high dose of acetaminophen (APAP) and is concomitant with disturbances of gut flora. Akkermansia muciniphila is beneficial for the repair of liver injury. Lycium barbarum polysaccharide, yam polysaccharide, and chrysanthemum polysaccharide all have anti-inflammatory and antioxidation effects. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of lycium barbarum polysaccharide, yam polysaccharide, and chrysanthemum polysaccharide (LYC) in improving DILI by increasing the abundance of A. muciniphila. Initially, screening for the optimal concentrations of wolfberry, yam, and chrysanthemum (WYC) or LYC to promote A. muciniphila proliferation in vitro and validated in antibiotic (ATB)-treated KM mice. Subsequently, APAP-induced DILI model in BALB/c mice were constructed to examine the treatment effects of LYC. Our findings indicate that the optimal concentration ratio of WYC was 2:3:2, and LYC was 1:1:1. WYC increased A. muciniphila proliferation in vitro and in ATB-treated mice under this ratio. Meanwhile, LYC increased A. muciniphila abundance in vitro and the combination LYC with A. muciniphila promoted the proliferation of A. muciniphila in ATB-treated mice. The overdose of APAP resulted in the impairment of the intestinal barrier function and subsequent leakage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, LYC increased A. muciniphila abundance, reduced intestinal inflammation and permeability, and upregulated the expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) and occludin contents in the gut. Lastly, LYC inhibited LPS leakage and upregulated hepatic YAP1 expression, ultimately leading to the repair of DILI.",

      "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) represents a significant global health concern, yet the available treatment options remain limited. Numerous studies have shown that gut microbiota is a critical target for the treatment of ALD. Additionally, there is increasing evidence that host metabolism also plays a crucial role in the development of ALD. Akkermansia muciniphila has been demonstrated to ameliorate experimental ALD through its modulatory effects on the intestinal vascular barrier, enhancement of mucus layer thickness, and promotion of intestinal tight junction proteins. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of studies investigating the impact of A. muciniphila on host metabolism and gut microbiota. Here, C57BL/6 mice were utilized to establish a modified NIAAA model in order to investigate the impact of the oral administration of A. muciniphila during the development of ALD. Furthermore, we employed targeted metabolomics to analyze the serum metabolomic profiles of the mice and 2bRAD-M sequencing to comprehensively examine the underlying mechanisms of the efficacy of A. muciniphila on ALD. Our results illustrated that the oral administration of A. muciniphila alleviated alcohol-induced liver injury in conjunction with encouraged serum levels of ornithine and diminished the elevation of oxalic acid levels induced by alcohol intake. In addition, A. muciniphila also inhibited the proliferation of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Helicobacter hepaticus, induced by alcohol consumption while promoting the growth of butyrate-producing and commensal bacteria, including Paramuribaculum intestinale and Bacteroides ovatus. In conclusion, this study suggests that A. muciniphila restores ALD by regulating the gut microbiota, and this corrective effect is associated with alterations in the serum metabolism. Our research supplies a theoretical basis for developing A. muciniphila as an innovative generation of probiotic for preventing and managing ALD."

A. muciniphila and its outer membrane protein Amuc_1100 ameliorate metabolic disorders, enteritis, depression, and other diseases in mice. The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. To assess the effect of A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100 on NAFLD, we used atorvastatin, a common lipid-lowering drug, as a positive control. A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100 significantly reduced body weight and serum ALT and AST levels, and improved serum lipid levels in NAFLD mice, which had similar effects to Ator. In addition, A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100 decreased the concentration of LPS in the serum and upregulated the mRNA expression of the colonic tight junction proteins. In the liver, A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100 significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of nodular receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and the protein and mRNA expression levels inflammatory cytokines. At the genus level, Amuc_1100 treatment significantly reduced the abundance of Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002 produced by the HFD. The abundances of Blautia, norank_f__Ruminococcaceae, Lachnoclostridium, GCA-900066575 and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 increased dramatically. Together, A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100 alleviate HFD-induced NAFLD by acting on the gut-liver axis and regulating gut microbes.",

      "abstract": "Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, is selectively decreased in the fecal microbiota of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), but its molecular mechanism in CRC development remains inconclusive. In this study, we first confirmed the inhibitory effect of A. muciniphila on CRC formation and analyzed the metabolic role of intestinal flora in human Polyps, A-CRA (advanced colorectal adenoma) and CRC samples. To better clarify the role of A. muciniphila in CRC development, a pseudo-germ-free (GF) azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model was established, followed by infection with or without A. muciniphila. Metabolomic analysis and RNA-seq analysis showed tryptophan-mediated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was significantly down-regulated in A. muciniphila-infected CRC mice. Then, mice with intestinal specific AhR deficiency (AhRfl/fl Cre) were generated and were used in 2 murine models: AOM/DSS treatment as a model of carcinogen-induced colon cancer and a genetically induced model using ApcMin/+ mice. Notably, AhR deficiency inhibited CRC growth in the AOM/DSS and ApcMin/+ mouse model. Moreover, AhR deficiency inhibited, rather than enhanced, tumor formation and tumor-derived organoids in Apc-deficient cells both in vivo and in vitro by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and TCF4/LEF1-dependent transcription. Furthermore, the antitumor effectiveness of A. muciniphila was abolished either in a human colon cancer tumor model induced by subcutaneous transplantation of AhR-silenced CRC cells, or AhR-deficienty spontaneous colorectal cancer model. In conclusion, supplementation with A. muciniphila. protected mice from CRC development by specifically inhibiting tryptophan-mediated AhR/β-catenin signaling.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Polyphenols have health-promoting effects, such as improving insulin resistance. Isoxanthohumol (IX), a prenylated flavonoid found in beer hops, has been suggested to reduce obesity and insulin resistance; however, the mechanism remains unknown. METHODS: High-fat diet-fed mice were administered IX. We analyzed glucose metabolism, gene expression profiles and histology of liver, epididymal adipose tissue and colon. Lipase activity, fecal lipid profiles and plasma metabolomic analysis were assessed. Fecal 16s rRNA sequencing was obtained and selected bacterial species were used for in vitro studies. Fecal microbiota transplantation and monocolonization were conducted to antibiotic-treated or germ-free (GF) mice. RESULTS: The administration of IX lowered weight gain, decreased steatohepatitis and improved glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, IX inhibited pancreatic lipase activity and lipid absorption by decreasing the expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36 in the small intestine, which was confirmed by increased lipid excretion in feces. IX administration increased markers of intestinal barrier function, including thickening the mucin layer and increasing caludin-1, a tight-junction related protein in the colon. In contrast, the effects of IX were nullified by antibiotics. As revealed using 16S rRNA sequencing, the microbial community structure changed with a significant increase in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in the IX-treated group. An anaerobic chamber study showed that IX selectively promoted the growth of A. muciniphila while exhibiting antimicrobial activity against some Bacteroides and Clostridium species. To further explore the direct effect of A. muciniphila on lipid and glucose metabolism, we monocolonized either A. muciniphila or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to GF mice. A. muciniphila monocolonization decreased CD36 expression in the jejunum and improved glucose metabolism, with decreased levels of multiple classes of fatty acids determined using plasma metabolomic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that IX prevents obesity and enhances glucose metabolism by inhibiting dietary fat absorption. This mechanism is linked to suppressing pancreatic lipase activity and shifts in microbial composition, notably an increase in A. muciniphila. These highlight new treatment strategies for preventing metabolic syndrome by boosting the gut microbiota with food components.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated evident changes in gut microbiota during the process of a variety of diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, aging, and cancers. Notably, gut microbiota is viewed as a potential source of novel therapeutics. Currently, Next-generation probiotics (NGPs) are gaining popularity as therapeutic agents that alter the gut microbiota and affect cancer development. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), a representative commensal bacterium, has received substantial attention over the past decade as a promising NGP. The components and metabolites of A. muciniphila can directly or indirectly affect tumorigenesis, in particular through its effects on antitumor immunosurveillance, including the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which also leads to better outcomes in a variety of situations, including the prevention and curation of cancers. In this article, we systematically summarize the role of A. muciniphila in tumorigenesis (involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal cancers) and in tumor therapy. In particular, we carefully discuss some critical scientific issues that need to be solved for the future using A. muciniphila as a representative beneficial bacterium in tumor treatment, which might provide bright clues and assistance for the application of drugs targeting A. muciniphila in clinical oncotherapy."

      "abstract": "Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF), a progressive process affecting the kidneys in chronic kidney disease (CKD), currently lacks an effective therapeutic intervention. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown promise in reducing RIF and slowing CKD progression. In this study, we demonstrated the dose-dependent attenuation of RIF by Ootheca mantidis (SPX), a commonly prescribed TCM for CKD, in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that SPX treatment prominently downregulated apoptosis and inflammation-associated pathways, thereby inhibiting the fibrogenic signaling in the kidney. We further found that transplantation of fecal microbiota from SPX-treated mice conferred protection against renal injury and fibrosis through suppressing apoptosis in UUO mice, indicating that SPX ameliorated RIF via remodeling the gut microbiota and reducing apoptosis in the kidneys. Further functional exploration of the gut microbiota combined with fecal metabolomics revealed increased levels of some probiotics, including Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), and modulations in glutamine-related amino acid metabolism in UUO mice treated with SPX. Subsequent colonization of A. muciniphila and supplementation with glutamine effectively mitigated cell apoptosis and RIF in UUO mice. Collectively, these findings unveil a functionally A. muciniphila- and glutamine-involved gut-renal axis that contributes to the action of SPX, and provide important clue for the therapeutic potential of SPX, A. muciniphila, and glutamine in combatting RIF.",

Although, its primary site of action consists in maintaining the gut barrier function, there are no study exploring if A. muciniphila controls glycemia via a gut to brain axis. Targeting the gut motility represents an alternative pathway to treat hyperglycemia. Here, we tested the impact of pasteurized A. muciniphila on gut motility, gut-brain axis and glucose metabolism. METHODS: We used mice fed a 45% high-fat (HFD) treated or not with pasteurized A. muciniphila MucT during 12 weeks. We measured the effects of the treatment on body weight gain, glucose metabolism (insulin, glycemia, glucose tolerance), gut contraction and enteric neurotransmitter release, and hypothalamic nitric oxide (NO) release. RESULTS: We show that pasteurized A. muciniphila exerts positive effects on different metabolic parameters such as body weight, fat mass, insulin, glycemia and glucose tolerance. This could be explained by the ability of pasteurized A. muciniphila supplementation to decrease duodenal contraction and to increase hypothalamic NO release in HFD mice. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a novel mode of action of pasteurized A. muciniphila explaining its beneficial impact on the control of glycemia in a preclinical model of type 2 diabetes via gut-brain axis signaling."

      "abstract": "An accumulating body of evidence suggests that the bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila exhibits positive systemic effects on host health, mainly by improving immunological and metabolic functions, and it is therefore regarded as a promising potential probiotic. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that A. muciniphila plays a vital role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by influencing the host brain through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Numerous studies observed that A. muciniphila and its metabolic substances can effectively improve the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders by restoring the gut microbiota, reestablishing the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, regulating host immunity, and modulating gut and neuroinflammation. However, A. muciniphila was also reported to participate in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders by aggravating inflammation and influencing mucus production. Therefore, the exact mechanism of action of A. muciniphila remains much controversial. This review summarizes the proposed roles and mechanisms of A. muciniphila in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and autism spectrum disorders, and provides insights into the potential therapeutic application of A. muciniphila for the treatment of these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a groundbreaking method of treating malignancies. However, cancer immunotherapy can only benefit a small percentage of patients, and the numerous side effects that might develop during treatment reduce its effectiveness or even put patients' lives in jeopardy. Surprisingly, the gut microbiome Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) can significantly inhibit carcinogenesis and improve anti-tumor effects, thus increasing the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy and decreasing the likelihood of side effects. In this review, we focus on the effects of A. muciniphila on the human immune system and the positive impacts of A. muciniphila on cancer immunotherapy, which can build on strengths and improve weaknesses of cancer immunotherapy. The potential clinical applications of A. muciniphila on cancer immunotherapy are also proposed, which have great prospects for anti-tumor therapy."

      "abstract": "Periodontitis is the most important cause of tooth loss in adults and is closely related to various systemic diseases. Its etiologic factor is plaque biofilm, and the primary treatment modality is plaque control. Studies have confirmed that Fusobacterium nucleatum can cause periodontitis through its virulence factors and copolymerizing effects with other periodontal pathogens, such as the red complex. Inhibiting F. nucleatum is an essential target for preventing periodontitis. The time-consuming and costly traditional periodontal treatment, periodontal scaling, and root planing are a significant burden on individual and public health. Antibiotic use may lead to oral microbial resistance and microbiome imbalance, while probiotics regulate microbial balance. Akkermansia muciniphila is a critical probiotic isolated from the human intestine. It can protect the integrity of the epithelial barrier, regulate and maintain flora homeostasis, improve metabolism, and colonize the oral cavity. Its abundance is inversely correlated with various diseases. We hypothesized that A. muciniphila could inhibit the effects of F. nucleatum and alleviate periodontitis. Bacterial co-culture experiments showed that A. muciniphila could inhibit the expression of the virulence gene of F. nucleatum. After treating gingival epithelial cells (GECs) with F. nucleatum and A. muciniphila, transcriptome sequencing and ELISA experiments on medium supernatant showed that A. muciniphila inhibited the inflammatory effect of F. nucleatum on GECs by inhibiting TLR/MyD88/NF-κB pathway modulation and secretion of inflammatory factors. Finally, animal experiments demonstrated that A. muciniphila could inhibit F. nucleatum-induced periodontitis in BALB/c mice.",

      "abstract": "The gut microbiota varies dramatically among individuals, and changes over time within the same individual, due to diversities in genetic backgrounds, diet, nutrient supplementations and use of antibiotics. Up until now, studies on dysbiosis of microbiota have expanded to a wider range of diseases, with Akkermansia muciniphila at the cross spot of many of these diseases. A. muciniphila is a Gram-negative bacterium that produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and Amuc_1100 is one of its most highly expressed outer membrane proteins. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on correlations between A. muciniphila and involved neuropsychological diseases published in the last decade, with a focus on the potential of this bacterium and its outer membrane proteins as therapeutic targets for these diseases, on the basis of evidence accumulated from animal and clinical studies, as well as mechanisms of action from peripheral to central nervous system (CNS)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with gut microbiota and has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, but the relationship between specific strains and NAFLD has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to investigate whether Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium bifidum could prevent NAFLD, the effects of their action alone or in combination, possible mechanisms, and modulation of the gut microbiota. METHODS: Mice were fed with high-fat diets (HFD) for 20 weeks, in which experimental groups were pretreated with quadruple antibiotics and then given the corresponding bacterial solution or PBS. The expression of the glycolipid metabolism indicators, liver, and intestinal farnesol X receptors (FXR), and intestinal mucosal tight junction proteins were detected. We also analyzed the alterations of inflammatory and immune status and the gut microbiota of mice. RESULTS: Both strains were able to attenuate mass gain (p<0.001), insulin resistance (p<0.001), and liver lipid deposition (p<0.001). They also reduced the levels of the pro-inflammatory factors (p<0.05) and the proportion of Th17 (p<0.001), while elevating the proportion of Treg (p<0.01). Both strains activated hepatic FXR while suppressing intestinal FXR (p<0.05), and elevating tight junction protein expression (p<0.05). We also perceived changes in the gut microbiota and found both strains were able to synergize beneficial microbiota to function. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of A. muciniphila or B. bifidum alone or in combination was protective against HFD-induced NAFLD formation and could be used as alternative treatment strategy for NAFLD after further exploration."
