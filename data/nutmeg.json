      "abstract": "Nutmeg is a commonly used spice that contains myristicin, a compound with anticholinergic and psychoactive properties. Excessive consumption can lead to toxicity, causing psychiatric and anticholinergic symptoms such as tachycardia, dizziness, dry mouth, tremors, and nausea. Nutmeg poisoning is rare and not widely recognized. This report describes the case of a 33-year-old woman who accidentally ingested a toxic amount of nutmeg while cooking. She presented with symptoms of dry mouth, tremors, dizziness, and anxiety and was subsequently diagnosed with nutmeg poisoning. Blood tests revealed electrolyte abnormalities, while cardiac function and respiratory status were normal. The patient was treated with fluid restriction and symptomatic management, with symptoms resolving within 24 hours. This case highlights the need for greater awareness of nutmeg's toxic effects and the importance of recognizing its symptoms and providing appropriate treatment. Nutmeg can pose significant health risks if consumed excessively despite its widespread availability. Education and prevention measures are crucial to avoid complications, including electrolyte abnormalities. Healthcare providers should consider nutmeg poisoning in differential diagnoses involving anticholinergic and sympathomimetic symptoms, as early recognition and management are essential to patient recovery."

      "abstract": "Second-degree burn, the most common among burn degrees, underscores the importance of timely and proper treatment in influencing prognosis. Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans), renowned for its potent antibacterial and antifungal properties, also serves as an effective antiseptic for open wounds. The aim of this study was to identify the phytochemical constituents of nutmeg essential oil and analyze the wound healing effect of nutmeg cream on second-degree burns in an animal model. An experimental study with a completed randomized design was conducted on Rattus norvegicus strain Wistar rats with second-degree burn. This study had four groups and each group consisting of four rats: B (burn-treated base cream), B+N (burn-treated 3% nutmeg cream), B+SSD (burn-treated silver sulfadiazine (BSS)), and B+N+SSD (burn-treated 3% nutmeg cream and SSD in a 1:1 ratio). The phytochemical analysis of nutmeg essential oil was conducted by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The burn diameter and burn wound healing percentage were measured from day 0 to 18. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis using the least significant difference (LSD) was employed to analysis the effect. The phytochemical analysis of nutmeg essential oil found that myristicin, terpinene-4-ol, terpinene, safrole and terpinolene were the most abundant putative compounds in nutmeg essential oil. On day 0, the average burn wound diameters were 1.4 cm in all groups and increases were observed in all groups on day 3. The wound diameter decreased until day 18 with the smallest burn wound diameter was found in the B+N group (0.86±0.37 cm), followed by B+SSD (0.93±0.29 cm). The B+SSD group exhibited the highest percentage of burn wound healing (56.80±14.05%), which was significantly different from the base cream (p<0.05). The percentage of burn wound healing in rats given 3% nutmeg cream was 41.88±13.81%, suggesting that nutmeg cream could promote burn wound healing in rats induced by second-degree burns.",

      "abstract": "This study used polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and heat-treated polyacrylonitrile (H-PAN) membranes to enrich nutmeg essential oils, which have more complex compositions compared with common oils. The oil rejection rate of the H-PAN membrane was higher than that of the PAN membrane for different oil concentrations of nutmeg essential oil-in-water emulsions. After heat treatment, the H-PAN membrane showed a smaller pore size, narrower pore size distribution, a rougher surface, higher hydrophilicity, and higher oleophobicity. According to the GC-MS results, the similarities of the essential oils enriched by the PAN and H-PAN membranes to those obtained by steam distillation (SD) were 0.988 and 0.990, respectively. In addition, these two membranes also exhibited higher essential oil rejection for Bupleuri Radix, Magnolia Officinalis Cortex, Caryophylli Flos, and Cinnamomi Cortex essential oil-in-water emulsions. This work could provide a reference for membrane technology for the non-destructive separation of oil with complex components from oil-in-water emulsions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: For centuries, plant seed extracts have been widely used and valued for their benefits. They have been used in food, perfumes, aromatherapy, and traditional medicine. These natural products are renowned for their therapeutic properties and are commonly used in medicinal treatments. Their significant pharmacological profiles provide an excellent hallmark for the prevention or treatment of various diseases. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the biological and pharmacological properties of nutmeg seeds and explored their efficacy in treating various illnesses. METHOD: Published articles in databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, Elsevier, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Wiley, were analyzed using keywords related to nutmeg seed. The searched keywords were chemical compounds, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antidiabetic, anticancer properties, and their protective mechanisms in cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Nutmeg seeds have been reported to have potent antimicrobial properties against a wide range of various bacteria and fungi, thus showing potential for combating microbial infections and promoting overall health. Furthermore, nutmeg extract effectively reduces oxidative stress and inflammation by improving the body's natural antioxidant defense mechanism. Nutmeg affected lipid peroxidation, reduced lipid oxidation, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and increased phospholipid and cholesterol excretion. In addition, nutmeg extract improves the modulation of cardiac metabolism, accelerates cardiac conductivity and ventricular contractility, and prevents cell apoptosis. This study elucidated the psychotropic, narcotic, antidepressant, and anxiogenic effects of nutmeg seeds and their potential as a pharmaceutical medicine. Notably, despite its sedative and toxic properties, nutmeg ingestion alone did not cause death or life-threatening effects within the dosage range of 20-80 g powder. However, chemical analysis of nutmeg extracts identified over 50 compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, and polyphenolic compounds, which exhibit antioxidant properties and can be used as phytomedicines. Moreover, the exceptional pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of nutmeg have been found different for different administration routes, yet, more clinical trials are still needed. CONCLUSION: Understanding the chemical composition and pharmacological properties of nutmeg holds promise for novel drug discovery and therapeutic advancements. Nutmeg seed offers therapeutic and novel drug prospects that can revolutionize medicine. By delving into their pharmacological properties, we can uncover the vast potential possibilities of this natural wonder."

      "abstract": "The study evaluated the effect of adding of nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt.) essential oil (NEO) as a feed additive on methane production, rumen fermentation parameters, rumen enzyme activity, and nutrient digestibility in vitro. This study was divided into three treatments based on the level of NEO addition, which included 0 µL/L (T0), 100 µL/L (T1), and 200 µL/L (T2). The feed substrate composition consisted of king grass as forage and concentrate in a 60:40 ratio. Feed fermentation was conducted using the Menke and Steingass gas production and two-step Tilley and Terry in-vitro digestibility technique. The data obtained from the study were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and if there were differences between means, they were further assessed using DMRT. The results showed that T2 treatment significantly decreased (P < 0.05) ammonia (NH3) levels, total VFA, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and microbial protein (P < 0.05). Methane production and the activity of rumen protease enzyme significantly decreased (P < 0.05) at T1 and T2 treatment. The T2 treatment significantly reduced (P < 0.05) protein digestibility (IVCPD) at 48 h, while IVCPD at 96 h significantly increased (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the addition of nutmeg essential oil did not effect the activity of the amylase, carboxymethyl cellulase, and β-glucosidase enzymes, as well as the in-vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD), crude fiber (IVCFD), and organic matter (IVOMD). The conclusion drawn from this study is that the optimum level for NEO is 200 µL/L, which can reduce methane production and increase crude protein digestibility at 96 h without any negative effect on rumen fermentation and nutrient digestibility.",

      "abstract": "Nutmeg is the seed derived from Myristica fragrans. Nutmeg seeds contain alkylbenzene derivatives such as myristicin, which are toxic to the human organism, and lignan compounds such as nectandrin B, which possess anti-aging and anti-diabetic properties. However, the anti-adipogenic, prolipolytic and anti-inflammatory effects of lignan-enriched nutmeg extract (LNX) on preadipocytes remain unclear. In the present study, the effects of LNX on lipid accumulation, glycerol release and inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were investigated. Oil red O staining demonstrated that treatment with LNX resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in lipid accumulation in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes without affecting cell growth. Mechanistically, LNX treatment at 6 µg/ml led to a reduction in phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), whereas it did not influence the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP-α) expression levels during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. In addition, LNX treatment at 6 µg/ml led to a decrease in fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression levels on day (D) 2, but not D5 and D8, during preadipocyte differentiation. Treatment with LNX at 6 µg/ml did not affect the expression levels of perilipin A during preadipocyte differentiation. In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, LNX treatment at 6 µg/ml did not stimulate glycerol release and hormone-sensitive lipase phosphorylation, which are known lipolysis hallmarks. Furthermore, LNX treatment at the doses tested had no effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced COX-2 expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Collectively, these results demonstrated that LNX has an anti-adipogenic effect on differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which is mediated by the downregulation of STAT3 phosphorylation and FAS expression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is an immunologic rationale to evaluate immunotherapy in the older glioblastoma population, who have been underrepresented in prior trials. The NUTMEG study evaluated the combination of nivolumab and temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma aged 65 years and older. METHODS: NUTMEG was a multicenter 2:1 randomized phase II trial for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged 65 years and older. The experimental arm consisted of hypofractionated chemoradiation with temozolomide, then adjuvant nivolumab and temozolomide. The standard arm consisted of hypofractionated chemoradiation with temozolomide, then adjuvant temozolomide. The primary objective was to improve overall survival (OS) in the experimental arm. RESULTS: A total of 103 participants were randomized, with 69 in the experimental arm and 34 in the standard arm. The median (range) age was 73 (65-88) years. After 37 months of follow-up, the median OS was 11.6 months (95% CI, 9.7-13.4) in the experimental arm and 11.8 months (95% CI, 8.3-14.8) in the standard arm. For the experimental arm relative to the standard arm, the OS hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.54-1.33). In the experimental arm, there were three grade 3 immune-related adverse events which resolved, with no unexpected serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Due to insufficient evidence of benefit with nivolumab, the decision was made not to transition to a phase III trial. No new safety signals were identified with nivolumab. This complements the existing series of immunotherapy trials. Research is needed to identify biomarkers and new strategies including combinations."

The attractive properties of BC, such as biocompatibility, good physicochemical and mechanical stability, and high water absorption, led to the choice of this material to be used as a support. Essential oils have been added to provide antimicrobial properties to these dressings. The results confirmed the presence of oils in the structure of the bacterial cellulose membrane and the ability of the materials to inhibit the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. By performing antibacterial tests on membranes loaded with fir needle essential oil, we demonstrated the ability of these membranes to inhibit bacterial adhesion to the substrate. The samples loaded with nutmeg essential oil exhibited the ability to inhibit the adhesion of bacteria to the surface of the materials, with the 5% sample showing a significant decrease. The binding of essential oils to the membrane was confirmed by thermal analysis and infrared characterization."

      "abstract": "Nutmeg is an inexpensive, readily available spice used in a variety of recipes. However, the use of nutmeg powder as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic effects is resulting in an increase in overdose rates. We encountered a male patient being hospitalized after ingesting 75 g of commercially available nutmeg powder with the intent of committing suicide. There are no available reports documenting the toxic or comatose-fatal blood concentrations or time-course of drug action in cases of nutmeg poisoning. Therefore, to improve patient management, we endeavored to determine the blood serum levels and time-course of the major psychoactive compounds (safrole, myristicin, and elemicin) present in nutmeg. We designed a simple and reliable method using the MonoSpin® extraction kit and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect the presence of these psychoactive compounds in human serum. The method had detection and quantitation limits of 0.14-0.16 and 0.5 ng/mL (lowest calibration points), respectively. The calibration curves displayed excellent linearity (0.996-0.997) for all three compounds at 0.5-300 ng/mL blood concentrations. The intra- and inter-day precision values for quality assurance were in the ranges of 2.4-11 % and 2.5-11 %, respectively; bias ranged from - 2.6 % to 2.1 %. Blood serum levels of safrole, myristicin, and elemicin were measured at admission (approximately 8 h post-ingestion) and approximately 94 h after a post-admission fluid therapy to evaluate their biological half-lives. We developed this method to obtain information on the psychoactive constituents of nutmeg and, thereby, determine the toxicokinetic parameters of nutmeg in a case of nutmeg poisoning.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A medicinal plant, Myristica fragrans seed meal (nutmeg), was utilized to evaluate its impact on the growth, immunity, and antioxidant defense of zebrafish (Danio rerio). METHODS: In this regard, zebrafish (0.47 ± 0.04 g) (mean ± S.D.) were fed with 0% (control), 1% (T1-nutmeg), 2% (T2-nutmeg), and 3% (T3-nutmeg) of powdered nutmeg for 70 days. At the end of the feeding trial, growth performance, survival rate of fish, and temperature-challenge effects were recorded. Immune and antioxidant parameters were also assessed through the collection of serum and skin mucus samples. RESULTS: The results indicated that nutmeg supplementation did not significantly influence the growth of zebrafish (P > 0.05); however, the survival rate of fish fed with 2 and 3% of nutmeg supplementation significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The skin mucus and serum total protein, total immunoglobulin (Ig), and lysozyme activity were significantly increased in T3-nutmeg treatment in comparison to the control (P < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were also enhanced in the T3-nutmeg group (P < 0.05). Nutmeg supplementation significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of growth hormone (gh) and insulin growth factor-1 (igf-1). Moreover, the nutmeg inclusion upregulated the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), lysozyme, sod, and cat. The dietary supplementation of nutmeg significantly increased the resistance of zebrafish against cold-water shock and survivability afterward (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: In conclusion, the supplementation of 3% powdered nutmeg in zebrafish diets could be suggested as an effective immune stimulator that improves antioxidant defense and stress tolerance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nutmeg-5, an ancient and classic formula in traditional Mongolian medicine comprising five kinds of traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI, called heart \"Heyi\" disease in Mongolian medicine). Cardiac fibrosis plays a critical role in the development and progression of heart failure after MI. However, the material basis and pharmacological mechanisms of the effect of Nutmeg-5 on cardiac fibrosis after MI remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to first explore the potential material basis and molecular mechanism of action of Nutmeg-5 in improving cardiac fibrosis after MI via a multiomics approach. METHODS: The constituents in Nutmeg-5 were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC)-based fingerprints of Nutmeg-5 were analysed, and characteristic peaks were identified by comparison to standard samples. A rat MI model was created by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery. The protective effect of Nutmeg-5 on cardiac fibrosis after MI was evaluated by tissue histology and measurement of the serum biomarkers of myocardial injury. Cardiac fibrosis levels were evaluated by Sirius red staining. Differentially expressed proteins in the myocardium and metabolites in the serum were explored by proteomic and untargeted metabolome analyses, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to explore the association between serum metabolites and myocardial proteins. RESULTS: A total of 67 constituents were identified in Nutmeg-5 by UPLC-MS/MS. Sixteen components were identified in the fingerprint of Nutmeg-5 by comparison with a standard sample. Six lactones were isolated from Nutmeg-5 and quantified by HPLC and GC. MI was significantly alleviated in Nutmeg-5-treated rats compared to MI rats, as demonstrated by their decreased mortality, improved cardiac function, and attenuated cardiac fibrosis and myocardial injury. A total of 252 significant differential metabolites were identified in plasma between model and Nutmeg-5-treated rats by untargeted metabolome analysis. Among these, 36 critical metabolites were associated with Nutmeg-5 activity. Proteomic analysis identified 338 differentially expressed proteins in the rat myocardium between MI and Nutmeg-5-treated rats, including 204 upregulated and 134 downregulated proteins. Protein set enrichment analysis revealed that Nutmeg-5 treatment significantly inhibited the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction pathway, which was activated in the myocardium of MI rats. A significant decrease in collagen and alpha smooth muscle actin expression levels was found in the myocardium of Nutmeg-5-treated rats compared to MI rats. These results illustrated that Nutmeg-5 had a significant protective effect on cardiac fibrosis after MI. A significant correlation was found between the ECM-receptor interaction pathway in the myocardium and critical metabolites in the serum. In addition, there were positive correlations between the levels of critical metabolites and the expression levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and Smad2 in the rat myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: Nutmeg-5 alleviated cardiac fibrosis after MI in rats by inhibiting the myocardial ECM-receptor interaction pathway and TGF-β1/Smad2 signalling, which was achieved by regulating plasma metabolites.",

      "abstract": "Myristicin, a potential toxicant, is a major ester present in the pericarp of nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) and alcohol acyltransferase (AAT) is responsible for its generation. The objective of the study was firstly to estimate the effect of blanching and pickling process on the inactivation of AAT and production of myristicin in nutmeg pericarp. Secondly, the effect of pickling process on the physical, microbial, antioxidant and sensory properties of nutmeg was evaluated. The nutmeg fruit pericarp was water-blanched for 0, 3, 5, 7 and 9 min. The increased blanching time significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the AAT activity (3.478 U/mg protein) compared to fresh nutmeg (39.034 U/mg protein). The reduction of myristicin was so efficient that it could not be detected after 9 min of blanching. Similarly, the pickling process significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the AAT activity and lowered the myristicin content. However, the blanching significantly (p < 0.05) lowered the total phenol content and reduced the free radical scavenging capacity of pickled nutmeg (BP) when compared with commercial pickled nutmeg. Blanched pickled nutmeg (BP) presented the same color characteristics as of commercial one, although significant reduction in hardness was observed. No growth of yeast and mold was noticed for all the blanched pickled nutmeg. The sensory analysis data demonstrated that blanching up to 7 min maintained the overall acceptability of pickled nutmeg as of commercial pickled nutmeg. Thus, the study suggests that blanching and pickling treatment improved the quality of nutmeg effectively by inhibiting the AAT activity and reducing the myristicin content."

The fabricated film was prepared by using naturally extracted nutmeg oil functionalized with ZnONPs in the presence of polyutherane (PU) medium. The bionanocomposite film was obtained by incorporating dropwise 10 % (w/v) of nutmeg oil to the PU solution/ZnONPs blend. The active constituents of nutmeg oil were determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The morphological characteristics of the resulting bionanocomposite film were confirmed using various microscopic and spectroscopic methods. Immunomodulatory potential of bionanocomposite was evaluated for RAW 264.7 macrophages. The results exhibited an excellent reduction in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, and TNFα) secretions after the treatment with bionanocomposite. The bionanocomposite exerted the highest inhibitory effects on certain cell signaling constituents that influence the initiation of expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The bionanocomposite was also tested for DPPH and ABTS free radicals scavenging assays and showed excellent antioxidant potential with IC50 values (0.28 ± 0.22 and 0.49 ± 0.36), respectively. The outcomes suggested promising immunomodulatory and antioxidant potentials for the biogenic synthesized nutmeg oil/PU/ZnONPs polymeric bionanocomposite."

Pancreatic lipase (PL) is the key enzyme for absorption of dietary lipids. Excessive consumption of cafeteria foods leads to obesity. Nutmeg is being used as a spice and it has many medicinal values. We aimed to see whether nutmeg could be used as a potential source of new lipase inhibitors and to explore its molecular mechanism in obesity. An in vitro study, which was performed to check its anti-lipase activity, showed a potent lipase inhibition (66.24%). A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was carried out to identify new compounds, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) with MW 536 at RT 15.2 min was isolated. A molecular docking study, that was carried out to check the interaction between THF and PL, found a PL inhibitory action of tetrahydrofuran. A further in vivo study was conducted to see PL inhibition. The percentage of fecal fat was higher in nutmeg treated rats. The size and number of adipose tissue fat cells were also decreased after treatment with nutmeg extract, which pointed to the inhibition of PL by the newly identified compound, THF. These four different types of studies suggested that nutmeg could potentially inhibit pancreatic lipase."

However, its material basis and pharmacological mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to explore the potential material basis and molecular mechanism of Nutmeg-5 in improving cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The constituents of Nutmeg-5 absorbed into the blood were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A mouse MI model was induced in male Kunming mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LDA) ligation. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function. The protective effect of Nutmeg-5 and compound Danshen dripping pills as positive control medicine on post-MI cardiac remodeling was evaluated by tissue histology and determination of the serum protein levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury. RNA sequencing analysis of mouse left ventricle tissue was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of Nutmeg-5 in cardiac remodeling after MI. RESULTS: A total of 27 constituents absorbed into blood were identified in rat plasma following gavage administration of Nutmeg-5 (0.54 g/kg) for 1 h. We found that ventricular remodeling after MI was significantly improved after Nutmeg-5 treatment in mice, which was demonstrated by decreased mortality, better cardiac function, decreased heart weight to body weight and heart weight to tibia length ratios, and attenuated cardiac fibrosis and myocardial injury. RNA sequencing revealed that the protective effect of Nutmeg-5 on cardiac remodeling after MI was associated with improved heart metabolism. Further study found that Nutmeg-5 treatment could preserve the ultrastructure of mitochondria and upregulate gene expression related to mitochondrial function and structure. HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit) expression was significantly upregulated in the hearts of MI mice and significantly suppressed in the hearts of Nutmeg-5-treated mice. In addition, Nutmeg-5 treatment significantly activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha signaling pathway, which was inhibited in the hearts of MI mice. CONCLUSIONS: Nutmeg-5 attenuates cardiac remodeling after MI by improving heart metabolism and preserving mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting HIF-1α expression in the mouse heart after MI.",

      "abstract": "Myristicafragrans Houtt. (Nutmeg) is a widely known folk medicine across several parts of Asia, particularly used in antimicrobial treatment. Bacterial resistance involves the expression of efflux pump systems (chromosomal norA and mepA) in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Crude extract (CE) and essential oil (EO) obtained from nutmeg were applied as efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), thereby enhancing the antimicrobial activity of the drugs they were used in. The major substances in CE and EO, which function as EPIs, in a descending order of % peak area include elemicin, myristicin, methoxyeugenol, myristicin, and asarone. Here, we investigated whether the low amount of CE and EO used as EPIs was sufficient to sensitize MRSA killing using the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, which acts as an efflux system. Interestingly, synergy between ciprofloxacin and CE or EO revealed the most significant viability of MRSA, depending on norA and mepA, the latter being responsible for EPI function of EO. Therefore, CE and EO obtained from nutmeg can act as EPIs in combination with substances that act as efflux systems, thereby ensuring that the MRSA strain is susceptible to antibiotic treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a promising approach to obesity treatment. During browning, WAT transforms into beige adipose tissue through stimulation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Nutmeg, one of the Indonesian herbs, reportedly has dual roles as a PPARα/γ partial agonist. Even though nutmeg has been traditionally used in body weight reduction, there is limited information regarding the potential role of nutmeg in browning of WAT. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explored the effect of nutmeg seed extract (NuSE) as a potential inductor of WAT browning. METHODS: Twelve male Wistar rats, 5-6 weeks old, were divided into control and nutmeg groups. The rats in nutmeg group were given NuSE for 12 weeks by oral gavage. After 12 weeks, the rat's inguinal WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were collected, weighed and stored at - 80°C until use. RESULTS: We observed that even though NuSE did not reduce the final body weight, it significantly reduced body weight gain. NuSE also increased protein levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) significantly and tended to increase UCP2 and UCP1 levels. Furthermore, NuSE induced macroscopic and microscopic morphological changes of inguinal WAT, marked by significantly increased adipocyte numbers and decreased adipocyte size. CONCLUSIONS: Even though NuSE did not increase UCP1 significantly, it potentially alters inguinal WAT characteristics and leads to browning through PGC-1α and UCP3 induction. However, UCP3's specific mechanism in WAT browning remains unclear. Our findings could contribute to obesity treatment in the future.",

To investigate the hepatotoxicity of different nutmeg exposure durations and doses, male mice were administered daily with normal saline, 1.0 g/kg nutmeg, or 4.0 g/kg nutmeg by intragastrical gavage for either 7 or 14 days (for a total of six treatment groups, n = 6). Body weight of each mouse was monitored daily. Histological analysis of liver tissues was performed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to investigate the morphological changes in hepatocytes. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to investigate liver function. Metabolomics and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed between treatment groups for identifying differential metabolites. Mice in the nutmeg exposure groups exhibited slow growth trends, hepatocyte damage, and significantly elevated serum AST and ALT levels associated with nutmeg dose and exposure duration. Metabolomics and KEGG enrichment pathway analyses also revealed differential levels of some metabolites related to liver function upon nutmeg exposure. Therefore, the present study reasonably speculates that nutmeg exposure may cause liver damage and affect liver function depending on the dose and duration.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were randomly divided into six groups of 8 rats each - group I, non-diabetic rats; group II, diabetic rats; groups III, IV and V, diabetic rats given orally nutmeg extract at levels of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively; and group VI, diabetic rats given orally metformin (100 mg/kg). The experiment lasted for 28 days. RESULTS: Data showed that nutmeg extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly decreased the blood glucose levels and increased the levels of serum insulin in diabetic rats. Administration of nutmeg extract to diabetic rats reduced oxidative stress and improved the antioxidant activities in pancreatic tissue. Histopathologic results of treated groups revealed marked improvement in the morphology of the pancreas compared with the control diabetic group. In addition, number of pancreatic islets and per cent of β-cells increased significantly in these groups in comparison with diabetic untreated group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that nutmeg extract has potent antidiabetic and β-cell protection activities in alloxan induced diabetic rats, possibly via its antioxidant properties.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of dietary nutmeg oil (NO) on growth performance, blood parameters, lipid peroxidation and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 expression in Korean native chicken (KNC) reared under hot temperature. We allocated 273 meat-type KNCs (Hanhyup-3, 4-week-old, body weight [BW] = 539.93 ± 1.75 g) to the following three treatments with seven replicate pens (13 birds/pen) per treatment. Three treatment diets were as follows: (a) Control, basal diet without NO supplementation; (b) NO 250; and (c) NO 500, basal diet supplemented with 250 and 500 ppm NO respectively. Diets and water were provided ad libitum throughout the 6-week feeding trial. During overall period (0-6 weeks), no differences (p > 0.05) were observed in BW gain (BWG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion rate (FCR) among treatments. However, the FI at 0-3 weeks decreased (p < 0.05) quadratically with increasing NO levels. Most blood parameters did not differ (p > 0.05) among treatments, although the monocyte level of the NO 500 group was considerably lower (p > 0.05) than that of the other groups. Furthermore, dietary NO did not affect serum triglyceride, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorus and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (p > 0.05); however, it linearly decreased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level (p < 0.05). Additionally, serum malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration decreased (p < 0.05) and heart MDA concentration was lower (p = 0.08) with increasing dietary NO supplementation. After a 3-hr heat (35°C) challenge, the rectal temperature (RT) reduced (p < 0.05) linearly with increasing NO levels. Dietary NO did not affect liver HSP70 (p > 0.05) gene expression. In conclusion, NO potentially enhanced the ability of chickens to alleviate heat stress. Furthermore, our findings suggest that lipid oxidation inhibition by dietary NO likely mediated the enhanced heat-stress tolerance of the chickens.",

      "abstract": "Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) is widely used to flavour sweet and savoury foods and has been used as a herbal medicine to enhance appetite in Asian countries. Nutmeg oil contains compounds such as myristicin and methyl eugenol. Previously, we found that inhalation of phenylpropanoid compounds increased appetite in mice. These volatile aroma compounds with appetite-enhancing effects have attracted the attention of healthcare professionals who care for older people with dementia because many of these older people have hypophagia, which leads to frailty and becoming bedridden. Thus, appetite-enhancing agents that are inexpensive and easy to administer are particularly desirable. In this study, we showed that the inhalation of nutmeg oil, myristicin and methyl eugenol produced appetite-enhancing effects in mice. Methyl eugenol alone has shown appetite-enhancing effects and locomotor-reducing effects at the same dose. In a previous study, benzylacetone produced those two effects at the same dose and also increased the body weight of mice significantly; methyl eugenol, however, did not because the mice experienced olfactory habituation after repeated inhalations of methyl eugenol. A structure-activity study showed that a carbonyl group on the aliphatic chain prevented habituation to aroma compounds, which is important information for identifying suitable phenylpropanoid compounds for long-term treatment of loss of appetite.",

      "abstract": "The sarcopenic phenotype is characterized by a reduction of muscle mass, a shift in fiber-type distribution, and reduced satellite cell regeneration. Sarcopenia is still a major challenge to healthy aging. Traditional Indonesian societies in Sulawesi island have been using nutmeg for maintaining health condition during aging. Interestingly, nutmeg has been known to stimulate peroxisome proliferator activated receptors γ (PPARγ) which may contribute to myogenesis process in cardiac muscle. There is limited information about the role of nutmeg extract into physiological health benefit during aging especially myogenesis process in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we want to explore the potential effect of nutmeg in preserving skeletal muscle mass of aging rats. Aging rats, 80 weeks old, were divided into two groups (control and nutmeg). Nutmeg extract was administered for 12 weeks by gavaging. After treatment, rats were anaesthesized, then soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were collected, weighted, frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until use. We observed phenomenon that nutmeg increased a little but significant food consumption on week 12, but significant decrease in body weight on weeks 10 and 12 unexpectedly increased significantly in soleus muscle weight (p<0.05). Nutmeg extract increased significantly gene expression of myogenic differentiation (MyoD), paired box 7 (Pax7), myogenin, myosin heavy chain I (MHC I), and insulin-like growth factor I (p<0.01) in soleus muscle. Furthermore, nutmeg increased serine/threonine kinase (AKT) protein levels and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), inhibited autophagy activity, and stimulated or at least preserved muscle mass during aging. Taken together, nutmeg extract may increase muscle mass or prevent decrease of muscle wasting in soleus muscle by partly stimulating myogenesis, regeneration process, and preserving muscle mass via IGF-AKT-mTOR pathway leading to inhibition of autophagy activity during aging. This finding may reveal the potential nutmeg benefits as alternative supplement for preserving skeletal muscle mass and preventing sarcopenia in elderly."

      "abstract": "Nutmeg is a Traditional Chinese Medicine used to treat gastrointestinal diseases. Some reports have indicated that nutmeg has hepatoprotective activity. In this study, a thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute liver injury model in mice was used to explore the mechanism of the protective effects of nutmeg extract (NME), including its major bioactive component myrislignan. The results indicated that NME could effectively protect TAA-induced liver damage as assessed by recovery of increased serumtransaminases, decrease in hepatic oxidative stress, and lower hepatic inflammation. Metabolomics analysis further revealed that treatment with NME led to the recovery of a series of lipids including lysophosphatidylcholines that were decreased and a lowering of acylcarnitines that were increased in mouse plasma and liver after TAA exposure. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that the hepatoprotective effect of NME was achieved by modulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) as well as the decrease in oxidative stress. NME could not protect from TAA-induced liver injury in Ppara-null mice, suggesting that its protective effect was dependent on PPARα. Myrislignan, a representative neolignan in nutmeg, showed potent protective activity against TAA-induced liver toxicity. These data demonstrate that nutmeg alleviates TAA-induced liver injury through the modulation of PPARα and that the lignan compounds in nutmeg such as myrislignan partly contributed to this action.",

Fresh nutmeg pericarps were treated with varying sugar concentrations (60, 70, 80%) with different soaking periods at ambient temperature. The OD-treated nutmeg extracts were analyzed for myristicin content via Gas Chromatography Flame Ionization Detector. The phenolic content and antioxidant capacity were analyzed using Follin-Ciocalteu and a free radical scavenging activity assay. The myristicin content was highest (1.69 mg/100 mg) at 80% sugar concentration after 3 h of soaking. Total phenolic content and free radical scavenging activity were highest at 3 h of 80% sugar solution treatment with values of 76.90% and 1.75 mg GAE/g, respectively. OD treatment at varying sugar concentration levels and durations affects the production of myristicin and antioxidant composition. Treatment of nutmeg with OD at 80% sugar concentration for 3 h is preferable, resulting in an acceptable level of myristicin and high antioxidants."

Several effective antifungal agents are available for oral Candida infections; the failure is not uncommon because isolates of Candida albicans may exhibit resistance to the drug during therapy. The present study aimed to identify an alternative, inexpensive, simple, and effective method of preventing and controlling the candidal infection. METHODOLOGY: All the procured and authenticated nutmeg seeds were dried in shade and cleaned by hand sorting. The crushed seeds were passed through mesh no. 40 individually. About 50 g of powdered nutmeg seeds was loaded in the supercritical fluid extractor unit using supercritical CO2 as extracting solvent in accordance with the methods of Nguyen et al. Supercritical fluid (SFE) extraction was done using CO2 gas without any cosolvents. RESULTS: The nutmeg extract displayed antifungal activity with the effective zone of inhibition ranging from 18.0 to 12.0 mm when compared with nystatin as positive control. CONCLUSION: This paper described the in vitro antibacterial activity, and phytochemical analysis of SFE extract of nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) evaluated against C. albicans (American Type Culture Collection 10231) through agar well diffusion method. SFE of nutmeg seeds can be used as an adjunct to conventional therapy for oral candidiasis."

The extract was subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the compounds present, which were then docked into the allosteric-binding site of deoxy-hemoglobin. The extract was incubated with sickled erythrocytes at 37°C for 6, 12, and 24 h and were subjected to antioxidative analysis for reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Chemical functional group of the treated cells was analyzed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The predominant compounds identified were 17-octadecynoic acid; oleic acid, androstan-3-one, 17-hydroxy-2-methyl- (2.beta.,5.beta.,17.beta.)-; estran-3-one, 17-(acetyloxy)-2-methyl-, (2.alpha., 5.alpha., 17.beta.), and (+)-3-carene, 10-(acetylmethyl)-. They all fitted well within the active site of Hb with good binding affinity, as evidenced by the negative CDocker interaction energies of their complexes ranging between -54.4 and -26.7 kcal/mol. Treatment with the extract exacerbated SOD and catalase activities as well as GSH level, while LPO was suppressed. This antioxidative activity was time and/or dose dependent, with 6 and 12 h incubation showing the optimum activity. FTIR analysis of the treated cells showed the presence of hydrophobic functional groups. The synergetic molecular interaction of the major compounds of the extract with the α-dimer of Hb depicts an antisickling effect of M. myristica acetone extract. This is accompanied by exacerbation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes activity and modification of the functional chemistry of the cells.",

We tested 63 samples of chilli (22 sanitized through heat treatment and 41 not heat-treated) and 52 samples of nutmeg (22 heat-treated and 30 not heat-treated) for aflatoxin, moulds and moisture content. Heat-treated samples were less contaminated than untreated samples. Spices in powder form (both chilli and nutmeg) were more contaminated than whole ones. In untreated spices, we observed a positive correlation between mould and moisture content. Of the powdered nutmeg and chilli samples, 72.5% and 50% tested positive for aflatoxin contamination, with a range of 0-17.2 μg kg(-1) and 0-10.3 μg kg(-1), respectively. The steam treatment of spices would be useful in reducing the initial amount of moulds. Although the risk from the consumption of spices contaminated with aflatoxins is minimal, owing to the small amount used in food, preventive screening of the whole food chain is very important, especially because the most frequently identified toxin was B1, which is the most dangerous of the four toxins (B1, B2, G1, G2).",

METHODS: Male albino rats (n=30) weighing 120 - 180 g, grouped into five (1-5) of 6 rats/group were studied. Group 1 (NC) rats were administered distilled water (1 ml) orally for 4 weeks and served as the negative control while group 2 (PC) rats were administered low dose (LD) cadmium (25 mg/kg body weight) orally for 4 weeks and served as positive control. Group 3 (TBE) rats were treated with spice mixture (SM); 300 mg/kg body weight orally for 2 weeks and then administered LD cadmium for 4 weeks. While group 4 (CET) rats were concurrently administered LD cadmium and SM for 4 weeks, group 5 (TAE) rats were administered LD cadmium for 4 weeks and then treated with SM for 2 weeks. The whole experiment lasted for 42 day after which the animals were sacrificed and blood collected for determination of biochemical parameters using standard procedures and techniques. RESULTS: Exposure to Cd produced greater increases in the liver function parameters. However treatment with SM significantly (p<0.05) reduced ALT in animals treated after exposure, AST and bilirubin in those treated before exposure and significant (p<0.05) increased serum albumin in animals treated before exposure to Cd. The altered renal function parameters and total serum cholesterol were restored to near normal values following treatment with SM. CONCLUSION: It may be concluded that concurrent intake of garlic, ginger and nutmeg at culinary dose in the diet has both therapeutic and prophylactic effect at mitigating Cd toxicity and reaffirms the safely of spices combinations as being currently practiced."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myristica fragrans Houtt. is one of the spices that has long been used for treatment of various disorders. M. fragrans is known as Chan-thet and its three parts i.e. wood, seed (nutmeg) and aril (mace), are ingredients in various Thai traditional remedies such as anti-pyretic, anti-allergy, anti-inflammatory remedies OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biological activities of ethanolic extracts obtained from wood, nutmeg and mace of M. fragrans according to the uses in Thai traditional medicine follow as: anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and antioxidant activities. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Three parts of M. fragrans (wood, nutmeg and mace) were macerated with 95% ethanol. The extracts were examined for anti-inflammatory activity by determination of inhibitory effect on LPS induced nitric oxide production release in RAW 264.7 cell lines, anti-oxidant activity by inhibitory effect on PMA-induce superoxide radical in DMSO differentiated from HL-60 cells, and anti-allergic activity by determining inhibitory activity of β-hexosaminidase release on RBL-2H3 cells. RESULTS: The ethanolic extract of wood presented potent anti-inflammatory activity more than nutmeg and mace (IC50 values = 40.26+0.58, 65.42+4.95 and 75.40+4.14 μg/ml, respectively). Nutmeg and mace showed high anti-oxidant activity while wood showed moderate activity (IC50 values = 21.164+1.03, 28.897+0.39 and 71.830+1.33 μg/ml, respectively). The extracts obtained from the three parts (wood, nutmeg and mace) showed strong anti-allergic activity (IC50 values = 13.29+0.28, 20.90+1.03 and 12.95+0.89 μg/ml respectively). CONCLUSION: The extracts obtained from wood of M. fragrans showed high anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activities but moderate anti-oxidant. The extracts of nutmeg and mace presented high anti-oxidant and anti-allergic activities but less antiinflammatory activity. Therefore, extract of wood should be selected for treatment of diseases that related with inflammation while the extracts of nutmeg and/or mace should be used as an antioxidant. Finally, extracts of all 3 parts of M. fragrans could be used for allergy-related diseases because all parts showed potent activity in anti-allergy, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant roles. However, the further study should be performed in animal models for investigation of each activity of active compounds following bioassay guided isolation.",

Hence, herbal medicines draw many attentions and have been shown effective in the treatment or relief of pain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here in this study, we used the CFA-injected rats as a sustainable pain model to test the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of nutmeg oil, a spice flavor additive to beverages and baked goods produced from the seed of Myristica fragrans tree. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that nutmeg oil could potentially alleviate the CFA-injection induced joint swelling, mechanical allodynia and heat hyperanalgesia of rats through inhibition of COX-2 expression and blood substance P level, which made it possible for nutmeg oil to be a potential chronic pain reliever."

An alternative method was developed, which is based on matrix solid phase dispersion and subsequent separation and detection of oxime derivatives of 2-alkylcyclobutanones by high performance-high resolution mass spectrometry. It is more rapid, less resource consuming, and more sensitive than EN 1785:2003. This method allowed detection of 2-alkylcyclobutanones in cashew nuts irradiated at 100 Gray and in nutmeg irradiated at 400 Gray. None of the 26 cashew nut and 14 nutmeg samples purchased in different EU Member States contained traces of 2-alkylcyclobutanones.",

Hypercholesterolemia was induced by administering cholesterol orally at a dose of 40 mg/kg/0.3 ml. Plant extracts 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight and Questran 0.26 g/kg were administered five times a week for eight weeks for amelioration. Hypolipidemic effects were evaluated by measuring total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) in the serum, while the protective ability was measured by the extent of lipid peroxidation (LPO) as well as enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants levels in post mitochondrial fractions (PMF) of the hepatic and cardiac homogenates. Serum aminotransferases activities were also monitored. Results obtained shows that treatment with M. myristica elicited a significant reduction in serum TC, TG and LDL-C levels while there was concomitant increase in HDL-C of hypercholesterolemic rats. Elevations in serum aminotransferases activities and LPO level were reversed and a significant amelioration was noticed in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants status in the liver and heart of hypercholesterolemic rats. This study suggests that M. myristica possess cholesterol lowering potentials and protective ability in experimental hypercholesterolemia rat model."

      "abstract": "Colon cancer is the most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer mortality in humans. Using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, the current study revealed the accumulation of four uremic toxins (cresol sulfate, cresol glucuronide, indoxyl sulfate, and phenyl sulfate) in the serum of mice harboring adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation-induced colon cancer. These uremic toxins, likely generated from the gut microbiota, were associated with an increase in the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and a disorder of lipid metabolism. Nutmeg, which exhibits antimicrobial activity, attenuated the levels of uremic toxins and decreased intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice. Nutmeg-treated Apc(min/+) mice had decreased IL-6 levels and normalized dysregulated lipid metabolism, suggesting that uremic toxins are responsible, in part, for the metabolic disorders that occur during tumorigenesis. These studies demonstrate a potential biochemical link among gut microbial metabolism, inflammation, and metabolic disorders and suggest that modulation of gut microbiota and lipid metabolism using dietary intervention or drugs may be effective in colon cancer chemoprevention strategies.",

Prior poison center series of nutmeg exposures show very few unintentional exposures of nutmeg to children younger than 13. Case series from these centers did not record drug exposures combined with nutmeg. This study is a review of Illinois Poison Center (IPC) data regarding nutmeg exposures from January of 2001 to December 2011. The goal of this study was to compare the Illinois data to the literature as well as look for current trends in nutmeg poisonings. The data were extracted using the code for hallucinogenic plants in the IPC database, and poisonings unrelated to nutmeg exposure were eliminated. Medical outcomes were noted as recorded. Thirty-two cases of nutmeg ingestion were reported. Of the 17 (53.1 %) unintentional exposures, 10 subjects (58.8 %) were under the age of 13. Four of the exposures in children under the age of 13 were ocular exposures. Fifteen exposures (46.9 %) were intentional exposures. Of these intentional exposures, five (33.3 %) were recorded to have combined drug intoxication. All of these were between the ages of 15 and 20. One patient with polypharmaceutical exposure required ventilatory support in the hospital. Our study shows an unexpected percentage of unintentional exposures in juveniles under the age of 13, out of the total exposures to nutmeg. Mixing of nutmeg with other drugs was seen and required more intervention in adolescents. More education about these two factors, i.e., nutmeg exposures as intentional polypharmacy in adolescents and unintentional exposures in young children, is advised.",

Topical therapies have been used for PDN with some benefit. Nutmeg has certain properties that may be effective in ameliorating neuropathic pain. The purpose of this study was to determine whether topical nutmeg extracts can reduce pain or improve the quality of life in PDN sufferers. DESIGN: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTINGS/LOCATION: It was conducted at a primary care center in Trinidad, Caribbean. SUBJECTS: Seventy-four (74) diabetic subjects who met criteria for painful neuropathy were recruited. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive either topical nutmeg extracts (NEMM; mace oil [2%], nutmeg oil [14%], methyl salicylate [6%], menthol [6%], and coconut oil) or placebo (MM; methyl salicylate [6%], menthol [6%], coconut oil, and alcohol). OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures of pain and quality of life were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory for Diabetic Painful Neuropathy and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat analysis was done for 24 male and 50 female subjects (30-85 years) with an average duration of diabetes of 11 years. Significant reductions in worst and average pain scores were seen within each group (p ≤ 0.001). Similarly significant reductions were also noted for interference with walking, sleep, and mood scores as well as burning, pins and needles, and tingling scores within each group (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between both groups after 4 weeks for any outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial topical, nutmeg extracts did not add to the improvements observed in PDN symptoms during 4 weeks treatment with preparations containing menthol and methyl salicylate. Further research designed to test the individual components of the topical therapies used in this study may clarify their benefit.",

Nutmeg has traditionally been used as a spice in food preparation and as an herbal remedy in the treatment of many medical conditions, including anxiety. Fifty-five rats were divided equally into 5 groups: control (vehicle); myristicin; midazolam (positive control); flumazenil and myristicin; and midazolam and myristicin. The behavioral component of anxiety was examined by using the elevated plus-maze (open-arm and closed-arm times) along with analysis of gross and fine motor movements. Data analysis was performed using a 2-tailed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and least significant difference post-hoc test. Our data suggest that myristicin does not decrease anxiety by modulation of the GABA(A) receptor but may promote anxiogenesis. When myristicin was combined with midazolam, an antagonist-like effect similar to the flumazenil and myristicin combination was exhibited by a decrease in anxiolysis compared with the midazolam-only group. Myristicin may antagonize the anxiolytic effects of midazolam, increase anxiety, and affect motor movements.",

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the California Poison Control System database for the years 1997-2008 for all cases of single-substance human exposure to nutmeg. RESULTS: There were a total of 119 single-substance exposures to nutmeg. Eighty-six (72.3%) exposures were intentional. Patients intentionally abusing nutmeg were more likely to be between the ages of 13 and 20 than those with unintentional exposure to the spice (80.2% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.05). Abusers were significantly more likely to require medical evaluation than nonabusers (61.6% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.05). Patients who abused nutmeg were significantly more likely (p < 0.05) to experience tachycardia and agitation than those whose exposure was unintentional. No major effects and no deaths were reported to occur in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Although nutmeg exposure is uncommonly encountered, clinical effects from ingestion can be significant and can require medical intervention. While clinically significant effects were common, life-threatening toxicity and death did not occur in this series.",

The rats in the treatment groups (A & B) received 0.1g (500mg/kg body weight) and 0.2g (1000mg/kg body weight) of nutmeg thoroughly mixed with the feeds respectively on a daily basis for forty-two days. The control group (c) received equal amount of feeds daily without nutmeg added for forty-two days. The growers' mash feeds was obtained from Edo Feeds and Flour Mill Limited, Ewu, Edo state, Nigeria and the rats were given water liberally. The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on the forty-third day of the experiment. The kidneys were carefully dissected out and quickly fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde for routine histological study after hematoxylin and eosin method. RESULT: The histological findings in the treated sections of the kidneys showed distortion of the renal cortical structures, vacuolations appearing in the stroma and some degree of cellular necrosis, with degenerative and atrophic changes when compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that oral administration of nutmeg may have some deleterious effects on the kidneys of adult Wistar rats at higher doses and by extension may affect its excretory and other metabolic functions. It is recommended that caution should therefore be advocated in the intake of this product and further studies be carried out to examine these findings."

The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation method on day thirty-three of the experiment, medial geniculate body was carefully dissected out from the brain and quickly fixed in 10% formol-saline for histological study. RESULTS: The findings indicate that rats in the treated groups (A & B) showed some cellular degenerative changes like hypertrophy, sparse cellular population, pyknotic nuclei with some microcystic changes, and vacuolation in the stroma of the treated medial geniculate body relative to those in the control group. CONCLUSION: Long term consumption of nutmeg may have adverse effect on microanatomy of medial geniculate body, which could negatively impact on the auditory sensibilities. Further research, including human observational studies, aimed at corroborating these observations is recommended."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the anticonvulsant activity of the volatile oil of nutmeg, the dried seed kernel of Myristica fragrans Houtt, using well-established animal seizure models and to evaluate its potential for acute toxicity and acute neurotoxicity. The volatile oil of nutmeg (nutmeg oil) was tested for its effects in maximal electroshock, subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole, strychnine and bicuculline seizure tests. All the experiments were performed at the time of peak effect of nutmeg oil. Nutmeg oil showed a rapid onset of action and short duration of anticonvulsant effect. It was found to possess significant anticonvulsant activity against electroshock-induced hind limb tonic extension. It exhibited dose dependent anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetetrazole-induced tonic seizures. It delayed the onset of hind limb tonic extensor jerks induced by strychnine. It was anticonvulsant at lower doses, whereas weak proconvulsant at a higher dose against pentylenetetrazole and bicuculline induced clonic seizures. Nutmeg oil was found to possess wide therapeutic margin, as it did not induce motor impairment when tested up to 600 microL/kg in the inverted screen acute neurotoxicity test. Furthermore, the LD(50) (2150 microL/kg) value was much higher than its anticonvulsant doses (50-300 microL/kg). The results indicate that nutmeg oil may be effective against grand mal and partial seizures, as it prevents seizure spread in a set of established animal models. Slight potentiation of clonic seizure activity limits its use for the treatment of myoclonic and absence seizures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myristica fragrans Houtt. (nutmeg) has been mentioned in Unani medicine to be of value in the management of male sexual disorders. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the aphrodisiac effect of 50% ethanolic extract of nutmeg along with its likely adverse effects and acute toxicity using various animal models. METHODS: The suspension of the extract was administered (100, 250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) to different groups of male rats daily for seven days. The female rats involved in mating were made receptive by hormonal treatment. The general mating behaviour, libido and potency were studied and compared with the standard reference drug sildenafil citrate. Likely adverse effects and acute toxicity of the extract were also evaluated. RESULTS: Oral administration of the extract at the dose of 500 mg/kg, produced significant augmentation of sexual activity in male rats. It significantly increased the Mounting Frequency, Intromission Frequency, Intromission Latency and caused significant reduction in the Mounting Latency and Post Ejaculatory Interval. It also significantly increased Mounting Frequency with penile anaesthetization as well as Erections, Quick Flips, Long Flips and the aggregate of penile reflexes with penile stimulation. The extract was also observed to be devoid of any adverse effects and acute toxicity. CONCLUSION: The resultant significant and sustained increase in the sexual activity of normal male rats without any conspicuous adverse effects indicates that the 50% ethanolic extract of nutmeg possesses aphrodisiac activity, increasing both libido and potency, which might be attributed to its nervous stimulating property. The present study thus provides a scientific rationale for the traditional use of nutmeg in the management of male sexual disorders.",

      "abstract": "Nutmeg is a common household spice sometimes abused for its hallucinogenic properties. This abuse is well reported in the medical literature over the last century. Ingestion of less than one tablespoon can produce symptoms similar to those of an anticholinergic toxic episode. Common presenting complaints are hallucinations, palpitations, and feelings of impending doom. We report a case of intentional nutmeg intoxication in a 23-year-old college student. As laboratory tests are usually normal, this diagnosis should be considered in patients presenting with an acute psychotic break accompanied by symptoms resembling an anticholinergic toxic episode. Treatment is primarily supportive once other life-threatening conditions have been ruled out.",

The nutmeg extract was administered intraperitoneally once daily for 17 consecutive days and only moderately reduced motor activity from corresponding control. A nutmeg dosage devoid of action on motility was chosen for short-term administration to mice. These nutmeg treated mice and the saline controls received either a single depressant dosage of ethanol or a stimulant dose of d-amphetamine. Nutmeg treated mice showed potentiation of ethanol-mediated depression on motility compared to controls. The d-amphetamine-produced stimulation of locomotor activity was decreased from controls by the nutmeg treatment. The results indicate that the nutmeg extract preparation used contained ingredients which synergistically interacted with alcohol as contrasted with their antagonism to d-amphetamine. The results suggest a CNS depressant action of nutmeg. Such CNS impairment by nutmeg may conceivably contribute to its toxic interaction with certain substances of abuse and may explain, in part, its addictive potential.",
