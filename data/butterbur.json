      "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the residual behavior and safety assessment of fenazaquin and metaflumizone in butterbur. The samples were periodically harvested, extracted using QuEChERS method, and determined by LC-MS/MS. The linearity of matrix-matched calibration curve was ≥0.99 for both compounds. The average recoveries of fenazaquin and metaflumizone at two fortification levels (0.01 and 0.1 mg kg-1) ranged from 86.6 to 97.2%. The relative standard deviation was <10%. After 7 days, the fenazaquin and metaflumizone initial residues in butterbur were dissipated to 79 and 78%, with the respective half-lives, 3.08 and 3.15 days. The proposed preharvest intervals (PHIs) for fenazaquin is recommended as twice treatment 14 days before harvest and metaflumizone twice treatment 7 days before harvest of butterbur. Risk assessment showed that the acceptable daily intake of fenazaquin and metaflumizone in butterbur was 0.004 and 0.029%, respectively. The respective theoretical maximum daily intakes of fenazaquin and metaflumizone were 58.74 and 15.15%, indicating negligible risk.",

      "abstract": "The liver is the most vital organ that could be influenced by inducers of hypersensitivity such as ovalbumin. The current study was carried out to explore the effects of butterbur (Petasites hybridus) extract on the ovalbumin-induced liver hypersensitivity in Swiss albino male mice. Animals were divided into 4 groups, 1st group served as a control group, 2nd group treated with daily oral administration of 75 mg/kg of butterbur extract, 3rd group received single oral dose 100 mg/kg of ovalbumin to induce hypersensitivity, and 4th group treated with oral administration of butterbur extract one-day post to the hypersensitivity induction. Ovalbumin induces a significant increase in the activity of liver enzymes and MDA and decreased the activity of CAT after the ovalbumin treatment. Histopathological investigations revealed marked pathological alterations in liver tissues in the form of hyaline degeneration and fibrosis. Additionally, heavy immune response indicated by immunostaining of MDA and TNF-α could be observed. In contrast, posttreatment with butterbur extract after hypersensitivity induction resulted in a significant decrease of liver enzymes and oxidative stress and reduced the inflammation and fibrosis of liver tissues. These results suggest that butterbur extract is considered as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapeutic herb for hypersensitivity treatment of liver.",

      "abstract": "Petasites hybridus (Common butterbur) is extensively used in traditional medicine, and is currently gaining interest and popularity as a food supplement and for its medicinal properties. It contains a large number of active compounds of potential therapeutic activity, but also toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Science-based information is needed to support the developing modern use of this plant, and to direct continued safe practice in traditional medicine. The present study focused on the essential oils from leaves and rhizomes of the understudied P. hybridus ssp. ochroleucus from the Balkans, and evaluated its phytochemistry and potential therapeutic activities (antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-cholinesterase and anti-inflammatory), as well its toxicology potential (acute toxicity in insects and mice). We studied the essential oils, which are not commonly used in traditional practices, but have a potential for safe use since the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are non-volatiles, are usually not present in the distilled essential oils. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids were indeed not detected in the essential oils; ingestion of the essential oils did not induce toxicity signs in mice, and topical application did not elicit skin irritation in humans. The essential oils had no antimicrobial properties against 20 pathogenic bacterial strains, but demonstrated good local anti-inflammatory activity in a Carrageenan-induced paw edema test. An insect toxicity test demonstrated that the leaf essential oil is an efficient insect repellent, and the demonstrated anti-cholinesterase activity suggests a potential for the treatment of neurological conditions. Isopetasin, a sesquiterpene found in plants of the genus Petasites, known to have anti-inflammatory effects, was present only in the rhizomes essential oil (3.9%), and sesquiterpene lactones concentrations were high, likely contributing to the antioxidant activity."

      "abstract": "Stress is an increasing problem that can result in various psychiatric and somatoform symptoms. Among others, benzodiazepines and valerian preparations are used to treat stress symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the prescription of a fixed herbal extract combination of valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, and butterbur (Ze 185) changes the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines in hospitalized psychiatric patients. In a retrospective case-control study, anonymized medical record data from 3,252 psychiatric in-house patients were analysed over a 3.5-year period. Cases (n = 1,548) with a prescription of Ze 185 and controls (n = 1,704) were matched by age, gender, hospitalization interval, and main International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 F-diagnoses. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of Ze 185 on the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines. Secondary objectives investigated the prescriptions of concomitant drugs and effectiveness of the hospital stay. Distribution of drug classes was analysed using the WHO's anatomic-therapeutic-chemical code. Data showed that both treatment modalities had a comparable clinical effectiveness but with significantly less prescriptions of benzodiazepines in the Ze 185 group (p = .006). This is of clinical importance because suitable alternatives to benzodiazepines are desirable. To obtain more support for this hypothesis, a dedicated randomized, controlled clinical trial monitoring drug safety is required.",

      "abstract": "An analytical method was developed to quantify the residual levels of the neonicotinoid insecticides, acetamiprid and thiacloprid, in field-incurred butterbur samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Samples were extracted with acetonitrile and partitioned with dichloromethane. After partitioning, purification was conducted using a Florisil® cartridge. Linearity of a matrix-matched calibration curve of the two compounds over a concentration range of 0.004-0.4μg/g was excellent, with determination coefficients (R2)≥0.9998. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for both acetamiprid and thiacloprid were 0.0006 and 0.002mg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries for acetamiprid and thiacloprid at two spiking levels (0.02 and 0.1mg/kg, i.e., 10×LOQ and 50×LOQ) were between 78.23 to 82.17%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs)≤7.22%. The method was successfully applied to field-incurred samples treated with a commercial pesticide product, either once (zero or 7 days before harvest) or twice (0 and 7, 7 and 14, or 14 and 21 days before harvest). The highest and lowest residues were obtained for the 7 and 0 days' treatment and the 21 and 14 days' treatment, respectively. The developed method is simple and accurate and can be extrapolated to other leafy vegetables.",

No differences were observed in body weight gain, food intake or feed efficiency between treatments, but relative liver weight in the butterbur group was significantly higher than that of the control group. In addition, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and glutathione levels in the serum and liver of the butterbur group were higher than those of the control group. Hepatic glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities and mRNA expression in the butterbur leaf group were higher than in the control group. Furthermore, hepatic cytochrome 2E1 mRNA expression was higher than in the control group. In vitro, an acetone extract of the butterbur leaf powder showed the strongest increase in TBARs level in a hepatic homogenate through 4 d. Our findings suggest that feeding 5% butterbur leaf powder to rats can cause adverse effects by increasing oxidative stress.",

Anxiety (visual analogue scale - VAS) and depression (Beck's Depression Inventory - BDI) served as primary parameters, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) was a secondary parameter.The 4-combination was significantly superior to the 3-combination and placebo (4-combination > 3-combination > placebo) in all the primary and secondary parameters (PP-population). Analysis of the ITT population confirmed these results. As to safety, no serious adverse events occurred.

Evidence-based prophylactic drugs may have considerable side effects. OBJECTIVE: This study was to assess efficacy of a butterbur root extract (Petadolex) and music therapy in primary school children with migraine. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, partly double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. METHODS: Following a 8-week baseline patients were randomized and received either butterbur root extract (n=19), music therapy (n=20) or placebo (n=19) over 12 weeks. All participants received additionally headache education (\"treatment as usual\") from the baseline onwards. Reduction of headache frequency after treatment (8-week post-treatment) as well as 6 months later (8-week follow-up) was the efficacy variable. RESULTS: Data analysis of subjects completing the respective study phase showed that during post-treatment, only music therapy was superior to placebo (p=0.005), whereas in the follow-up period both music therapy and butterbur root extract were superior to placebo (p=0.018 and p=0.044, respectively). All groups showed a substantial reduction of attack frequency already during baseline. CONCLUSION: Butterbur root extract and music therapy might be superior to placebo and may represent promising treatment approaches in the prophylaxis of paediatric migraine.",

Few clinical studies have been performed so far addressing the clinical effectiveness of Ze 339. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antiallergic properties of Ze 339 using skin prick tests with different stimuli, such as codeine, histamine, methacholine, and a relevant inhalant allergen. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in which Ze 339 was compared to acrivastine, a short-acting antihistamine, in 8 patients with respiratory allergy and in 10 nonatopic, healthy volunteers. Antiallergic activity of Ze 339 was determined by analyzing inhibitory potency in skin prick tests with codeine, histamine, methacholine, and an inhalant allergen. Wheal-and-flare reactions were assessed 90 minutes after a double dose of Ze 339, acrivastine, or placebo. An interval of at least 3 days was left between the skin tests. RESULTS: Acrivastine was identified as the only substance that significantly inhibited skin test reactivity to all solutions analyzed in all study subjects. In contrast, no significant inhibition could be demonstrated for Ze 339 with any test solution. Moreover, the results of Ze 339 did not differ significantly from placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found no antiallergic, particularly antihistaminic, effect of Ze 339 in skin tests using a variety of stimuli often used to evaluate immediate skin test reactivity. The mechanism by which Ze 339 is effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis still needs to be elucidated.",

In an open postmarketing surveillance study, 580 patients were treated with an average of 2 tablets of Ze 339 daily for 2 weeks. Symptoms of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, itchy eyes and nose, red eyes, and skin irritation were evaluated on a visual analogue scale. Symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis improved in 90% of patients. Differences observed before and after therapy were significant and clinically relevant for all symptoms. Improvement reported by the end of the study was found to be inversely related to symptom severity as described at baseline. Efficacy, tolerability, and improvement in quality of life were positively rated by 80%, 92%, and 80% of patients, respectively. A total of 44% of patients were given an antiallergic comedication. This combination did not result in a better effect than was attained with Ze 339 monotherapy. Adverse events occurred at a rate of 3.8%, and gastrointestinal complaints were predominantly nonspecific. Results of this postmarketing surveillance trial are consistent with observations documented in previous randomized, double-blind, prospective, controlled trials of the same extract that were conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Butterbur leaf special extract Ze 339 was confirmed by 3 GCP trials and 2 postmarketing surveillance trials to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.",

During the season of cedar pollen dispersal, many patients suffer from symptoms such as sniffling, sternutation, and itching of the eyes. Japanese butterbur is a popular vegetable and is one of the few domestic vegetables in Japan. The anti type I allergic effects of an aqueous ethanol extract from aerial parts of Japanese butterbur (JBE) were evaluated in rats and RBL-2H3 mast cells. In the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in rats, a single oral treatment of JBE (1000 mg/kg) was found to suppress the reaction. In IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells, JBE (10-100 microg/mL) inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release, leukotriene C(4)/D(4)/E(4) synthesis, and TNF-alpha production. Moreover, a high concentration of JBE (1000 microg/mL) suppressed smooth muscle constriction induced by histamine (10 microM) and leukotriene D(4) (10 nM) in a guinea pig trachea strip. The search for components in JBE with an inhibitory activity on mast cell degranulation was guided by inhibition of beta-hexsosaminidase release. Two eremophilane-type sesquiterpenes, six polyphenolic compounds, and two triterpene glycosides were isolated. Of these compounds, fukinolic acid, a principal polyphenol constituent, showed potent inhibitory activity (IC(50) value = 2.1 microg/mL). Consequently, On the basis of its inhibition of mast cell activation and direct smooth muscle reaction induced by released mediators, JBE was found to suppress the type I allergic reaction.",

A variety of medicines are used by sufferers whose anguish frequently leads to trying new treatments, increasingly from herbal sources. METHODS: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel group comparison study of Butterbur extract (Ze 339; 8 mg total petasine; one tablet thrice-daily), fexofenadine (Telfast 180, one tablet once-daily) and placebo in 330 patients. Protocol and analysis were according to the latest guidelines on new treatments for allergic rhinitis. The primary efficacy variable was a change in symptoms from baseline to endpoint during daytime. The secondary efficacy variables were: (a) as per primary variable (evening/night); (b) Physician's global assessment; (c) Responder rates. Safety was closely monitored. FINDINGS: Both active treatments were individually significantly superior to placebo (p<0.001) in improving symptoms of IAR, while there were no differences between the two active treatments (p=0.37). Superiority to placebo was similarly shown during the evening/night (p<0.001), by physicians' own assessment and by responder rates. Both treatments were well tolerated. INTERPRETATION: Butterbur Ze 339 and Fexofenadine are comparably efficacious relative to placebo. Despite being a herbal drug, Butterbur Ze 339 has now been subject to a series of well controlled trials and should be considered as an alternative treatment for IAR.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of a special butterbur root extract for migraine prevention in children and adolescents with severe migraines. BACKGROUND: Two randomized and placebo-controlled trials with a total of 289 migraine patients have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a special butterbur root extract in the reduction of migraine attacks in adults. We studied whether butterbur had the potential as an efficient and well-tolerated migraine preventive in children and adolescents. DESIGN/METHODS: 108 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 17 were included in a multicenter prospective open-label study. Participants suffered from migraines diagnosed according to IHS classifications for at least 1 year. Patients were treated with 50 to 150 mg of the butterbur root extract depending on age for a period of 4 months. Treatment progression was recorded in migraine journals especially designed for children and adolescents. RESULTS: 77% of all patients reported a reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks of at least 50%. Attack frequency was reduced by 63%. 91% of patients felt substantially or at least slightly improved after 4 months of treatment. About 90% of each, doctors and patients, reported well-being or even improved well-being. Undesired effects (7.4%) included mostly eructation. No serious adverse events occurred and no adverse event caused a premature termination. CONCLUSIONS: The results and low rate of adverse events in this open prospective migraine prevention study in children and adolescents are similar to the results of two multicenter placebo-controlled butterbur studies in adults. Butterbur root extract shows a potential as an effective and well-tolerated migraine prophylaxis also for children and teenagers.",

METHODS: This is a three-arm, parallel-group, randomized trial comparing Petasites extract 75 mg bid, Petasites extract 50 mg bid, or placebo bid in 245 patients with migraine. Eligible patients met International Headache Society criteria for migraine, were ages 18 to 65, and had at least two to six attacks per month over the preceding 3 months. The main outcome measure was the decrease in migraine attack frequency per month calculated as percentage change from baseline over a 4-month treatment period. RESULTS: Over 4 months of treatment, in the per-protocol analysis, migraine attack frequency was reduced by 48% for Petasites extract 75 mg bid (p = 0.0012 vs placebo), 36% for Petasites extract 50 mg bid (p = 0.127 vs placebo), and 26% for the placebo group. The proportion of patients with a > or =50% reduction in attack frequency after 4 months was 68% for patients in the Petasites extract 75-mg arm and 49% for the placebo arm (p < 0.05). Results were also significant in favor of Petasites 75 mg at 1, 2, and 3 months based on this endpoint. The most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly related to treatment were mild gastrointestinal events, predominantly burping. CONCLUSIONS: Petasites extract 75 mg bid is more effective than placebo and is well tolerated as a preventive therapy for migraine. Petasites 50 mg PO bid was not significantly more effective than placebo on the primary study endpoints.",

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison. SETTING: Multicenter, including 6 outpatient general medicine and allergy clinics. PATIENTS: One hundred eighty-six patients were randomized (Butterbur Ze339 high dose, 60; low dose, 65; and placebo, 61 patients). Established diagnostic criteria for intermittent allergic rhinitis were confirmed by skin allergy tests in all patients. INTERVENTIONS: High-dose group, 1 tablet 3 times daily; low-dose group, 1 tablet twice daily; or matching placebo. All groups were treated for 2 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main efficacy variable was change in symptoms from baseline to end point during the daytime. The secondary efficacy variables were Clinical Global Impression score, change in symptoms from baseline to treatment day 7, and responder rates. Statistical analysis was prospective, on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Improvement in the main efficacy variable was significantly superior in the Butterbur Ze339 groups, relative to placebo, and a significant dose relationship was observed between the 2 Butterbur doses. The clinicians' assessment of efficacy and the overall responder rates were significantly superior for the active groups compared with placebo. The incidence and type of adverse events were indistinguishable across the herbal treatment and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: Butterbur Ze339 is an effective treatment for intermittent allergic rhinitis symptoms and is well tolerated.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Butterbur (Petasites hybridus) contains the active ingredient petasin, which exhibits antileukotriene and antihistamine activity. Previous studies of intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR) have demonstrated a comparable response to butterbur compared with a histamine H1-receptor antagonist on the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey quality-of-life score. However, there has been no placebo-controlled study of the effects of butterbur use on objective and subjective outcomes in IAR. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of treatment with butterbur vs placebo on objective and subjective outcomes in IAR. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was carried out during the grass pollen season in Tayside, Scotland. Thirty-five patients (14 men and 21 women) with IAR received butterbur, 50 mg twice daily, or placebo for 2 weeks. Domiciliary measurements were taken in the morning and evening for peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) (the primary outcome variable), nasal and eye symptoms, and rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality-of-life score. RESULTS: Butterbur treatment had no significant effect on PNIF, total nasal symptom score, eye symptom score, or quality of life compared with placebo use. Mean (SEM) morning and evening PNIF values were 107 (6) and 114 (6) L/min, respectively, for butterbur vs 105 (6) and 117 (6) L/min for placebo. Mean (SEM) morning and evening total nasal symptom scores (maximum total score, 12) were 3.4 (0.4) and 3.5 (0.4), respectively, for butterbur vs 3.7 (0.3) and 3.8 (0.4) for placebo. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant clinical efficacy of butterbur use vs placebo use on objective and subjective outcomes in IAR. Further studies are now indicated to investigate the use of butterbur in persistent allergic rhinitis.",

OBJECTIVE: We performed a placebo-controlled evaluation of the effects of BB and fexofenadine (FEX) on subjective and objective outcomes in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. METHODS: Sixteen patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and house dust mite sensitization were randomized in double-blind cross-over fashion to receive for 1 week either BB 50 mg twice daily, FEX 180 mg once daily and placebo (PL) once daily, or PL twice daily. The peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) response to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) challenge administered as a single 400 mg/mL dose was measured over a 60-min period after challenge, and domiciliary total nasal symptom score was recorded. RESULTS: Pre-challenge values for mean+/-SEM PNIF (L/min) were not significantly different comparing all groups; BB (138+/-8), FEX (140+/-9), and PL (138+/-8). The maximum % PNIF fall from baseline after nasal AMP challenge was significantly attenuated (P<0.05) compared to PL (46+/-3), with BB (34+/-3) and FEX (39+/-3). The area under the 60-min time-response curve (%.min) was also significantly attenuated (P<0.05) compared to PL (1734+/-156), with BB (1052+/-258) and FEX (1194+/-161). There was also a significant reduction (P<0.05) in total nasal symptom score with BB (1.8+/-0.4) and FEX (1.8+/-0.4), compared to PL (2.8+/-0.5). There were no significant differences between BB and FEX for any outcomes. CONCLUSION: BB and FEX, in comparison to PL, were equally effective in attenuating the nasal response to AMP and in improving nasal symptoms, highlighting a potential role for BB in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.",

Concomitant asthma medication was permitted. The number, duration, and severity of asthma attacks decreased, while peak flow, forced expiratory volume (FEV1), and all measured symptoms improved during therapy. In addition, more than 40 percent of patients using asthma medications at baseline reduced intake of these medications by the end of the study.

The original protocol and analysis had a number of major shortcomings. In order to follow regulatory requirements, an independent reanalysis of the original data was performed. Following a 4-week baseline phase, 33 patients were randomised to treatment with two capsules 25 mg butterbur twice a day and 27 to placebo. The mean attack frequency per month decreased from 3.4 at baseline to 1.8 after 3 months (p = 0.0024) in the verum group and from 2.9 to 2.6 in the placebo group (n.s.). The responder rate (improvement of migraine frequency > or =50%) was 45% in the verum group and 15% in the placebo group. Butterbur was well tolerated. This small trial indicates that butterbur may be effective in the prophylaxis of migraine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of butterbur (BB), a herbal remedy, as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids in patients with atopic asthma is currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of BB, given as add-on therapy to asthmatic patients maintained on inhaled corticosteroids, assessing adenosine monophosphate (AMP) bronchoprovocation (primary outcome variable) along with other surrogate inflammatory markers such as exhaled nitric oxide, serum eosinophil cationic protein and peripheral blood eosinophil count. METHODS: Sixteen atopic asthmatic patients with mean (standard error of mean) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 78 (4)% predicted, maintained on their constant dose of inhaled corticosteroids throughout the study, received twice daily for 1 week either BB 25 mg or placebo (PL), in a double-blind, cross-over fashion, with a 1-week washout period prior to each randomized treatment. Measurements were made at baselines prior to each randomized treatment and following the randomized treatment period. RESULTS: Baseline values for the primary and secondary outcomes were not significantly different prior to BB and PL. AMP provocative concentration causing a 20% reduction from baseline FEV1 (PC20) as doubling dilution change from baseline, significantly improved (P<0.05) with BB, 0.6 (0.2), compared with PL, -0.1 (0.3); a 0.7 doubling dilution difference. Exhaled nitric oxide as change from baseline was significantly reduced (P<0.05) with BB, -1.2 (0.8) p.p.b., compared with PL, 0.5 (0.4) p.p.b. Both serum eosinophil cationic protein and peripheral blood eosinophil count as change from baseline were also significantly suppressed (P<0.05) with BB, -3.9 (3.3) microg/L, -31 (28)x106/L compared with PL, 3.3 (2.5) microg/L, 38 (16)x106/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chronic dosing with BB conferred complementary anti-inflammatory activity in atopic asthmatic patients maintained on inhaled corticosteroids. Further studies are now required to assess the potential role for BB as either monotherapy in milder patients or add-on therapy in more severe asthmatics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Butterbur (BB) or Petasites hybridus, a herbal remedy, exhibits in vitro inhibition of cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis. However, no placebo-controlled studies have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of BB on objective outcomes such as nasal provocation testing in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). METHODS: Twenty patients with grass-pollen-sensitized SAR were randomized in a double-blind, cross-over manner to receive for 2 weeks either BB 50 mg twice daily or placebo (PL) twice daily during the grass pollen season. Nasal adenosine monophosphate (AMP) challenge (the primary outcome) was administered as a single 400 mg/mL dose after each randomized treatment. RESULTS: Spontaneous recovery following AMP challenge (area under the response time profile curve as % x min+/-SEM) was significantly attenuated (P=0.028) with BB (584+/-289) compared to PL (1438+/-240); mean difference: 854 (95% CI 95-1614), and the maximum % peak nasal inspiratory flow reduction from baseline following AMP challenge was significantly blunted (P=0.036) with BB (30+/-4) compared to PL (43+/-5); mean difference: 13 (95% CI 1-25). CONCLUSIONS: BB exhibited protection against AMP-induced nasal responsiveness during the grass pollen season in sensitized patients. This is turn may explain its potential clinical efficacy in patients with SAR.",

DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, parallel group comparison. SETTING: Four outpatient general medicine and allergy clinics in Switzerland and Germany. PARTICIPANTS: 131 patients were screened for seasonal allergic rhinitis and 125 patients were randomised (butterbur 61; cetirizine 64). INTERVENTIONS: Butterbur (carbon dioxide extract tablets, ZE 339) one tablet, four times daily, or cetirizine, one tablet in the evening, both given for two consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores on SF-36 questionnaire and clinical global impression scale. RESULTS: Improvement in SF-36 score was similar in the two treatment groups for all items tested hierarchically. Butterbur and cetirizine were also similarly effective with regard to global improvement scores on the clinical global impression scale (median score 3 in both groups). Both treatments were well tolerated. In the cetirizine group, two thirds (8/12) of reported adverse events were associated with sedative effects (drowsiness and fatigue) despite the drug being considered a non-sedating antihistamine. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of butterbur are similar to those of cetirizine in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis when evaluated blindly by patients and doctors. Butterbur should be considered for treating seasonal allergic rhinitis when the sedative effects of antihistamines need to be avoided.",
