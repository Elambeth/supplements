      "abstract": "A study was undertaken to investigate the effects of non-antibiotic additives-citric acid, synbiotics, and probiotics-administered through drinking water on broiler growth performance, carcass characteristics, and blood biochemical profiles. A total of 400 one-day-old Cobb 500 broiler chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups: Control; no additives administered (CON); Citric acid @2.5 g/L water (CA); Synbiotic @0.2 g/L water (SB); Probiotic @0.5 g/L water (PB) and with each group having 4 replicates of 25 chicks. Growth performance metrics, such as body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR), were recorded weekly. At the end of the trial, the probiotic-fed group had significantly higher BW (p = 0.018), BWG (p = 0.027), and an improved FCR (1.62) compared to the CON (1.74), CA (1.66), and SB (1.70) groups (p = 0.042). Biochemical parameters showed significant differences in total cholesterol (p = 0.013) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (p = 0.039), with the PB group showing higher levels. These results suggest that citric acid, synbiotics, and probiotic additives provided through drinking water can enhance broiler growth performance, with probiotics offering the most promising benefits."

      "abstract": "Aged oily sludge (AOS) exhibits more challenging properties compared to ordinary oily sludge, making modification treatments essential for improving dewatering efficiency. This study innovatively employs citric acid (CA) as a pretreatment agent for AOS and combines pressure filtration (PF) and electro-dewatering (EDW) to conduct volume reduction experiments, while investigating the dewatering mechanism of CA pretreatment. Under a pressure of 75 kPa, the AOS moisture content decreased slightly from 80.12 % to 78.00 %, while the addition of 0.02 g CA/g AOS further reduced it to 71.69 %. Under conditions of 25 kPa and 25 V/cm, EDW lowered the moisture content to 47.36 %, achieving faster average dewatering rate of 0.086 g/s. This study investigated the oil and water distribution within sludge cake layers, analyzed their migration during EDW, and explained the anodic drying phenomenon. Engineering applicability was assessed through energy consumption and calorific value analyses. Mechanistic insights revealed oil component changes, highlighting the roles of surfactants, electric field forces, pH, and temperature. Formula-based calculations were also conducted for field-driven processes. This study presents an innovative deep dewatering technology for AOS, investigating the dewatering mechanism from various perspectives, including demulsification, electric field, pH, and thermal effects. Additionally, it evaluates the energy consumption and economic cost, providing a theoretical foundation for its engineering applicability and offering new perspectives for the treatment and disposal of AOS."

      "abstract": "Spotty liver disease (SLD) caused by Campylobacter hepaticus has emerged as an important cause of disease in table egg layers in the United States. The disease associated with C. hepaticus results in focal lesions on the livers of infected birds, reduced egg production, and increased mortality of layer hens. Currently, there are no approved treatments and no commercial vaccine available for C. hepaticus, and very limited research is available supporting best approaches for the control of C. hepaticus in organic or antibiotic free-laying hens. We assessed the potential effects of water acidification treatments for the control of C. hepaticus in challenged specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and transmission of the organism to naïve birds. The objective of this study was to develop a challenge and treatment model to assess the effects of oregano, apple cider vinegar, and citric acid as potential control measures for C. hepaticus in challenged birds. We divided 148 SPF chickens, 17 wk of age, into five groups; four groups (with 51% of the birds in each group orally challenged with C. hepaticus) and one negative control group (n = 8). A dose of 107 cfu/ml of C. hepaticus was given on day 1, day 4, and day 7 by oral gavage. At day 10 after the day 1 challenge, three challenged groups were treated for 5 days with either oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid in the water. One challenged but not treated group and the negative control received only water as treatment. Bile and liver samples from challenged and nonchallenged naïve exposed birds were collected from euthanatized birds at days 9, 15, 20, and 27 after the first day challenge to evaluate the presence of C. hepaticus gross lesions and detection via culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation. Results showed that challenged birds were able to develop mild to moderate multifocal liver lesions resembling SLD. Severe lesions were evident in the naïve, exposed nonchallenged birds. Positive bacterial culture and colony PCR positives were found in challenged birds in each challenge group. Results from PCR of DNA extracted from liver samples were able to detect a greater number of C. hepaticus-positive samples than culture PCR of bile alone. Treatment with oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid was not able to clear C. hepaticus from challenged birds because more than 44% of the challenged birds remained positive on liver PCR analysis posttreatment. Results also found that C. hepaticus could be passed horizontally because more than 29% of the naïve nonchallenged birds became C. hepaticus positive postintroduction to challenged birds. Overall, this study found that this challenge model for C. hepaticus was successful and that treatments did not clear C. hepaticus in challenged birds. Nevertheless, it appears that acidifying the water could help to reduce C. hepaticus load in naïve birds because in groups treated with oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid C. hepaticus could not be cultured from bile.",

      "abstract": "Due to the high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total volatile acids (TVA) in the range of 18,000-20,000 mg/L and 4,900-5,600 mg/L, respectively, the treatment of citric acid production wastewater is a challenge. An anaerobic hybrid reactor (AHR) was used to treat this wastewater. The AHR operated at the maximum organic loading rate (OLR) of 7.6 kg COD/m3/d and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.5 days without any inhibition. The COD removal efficiency, methane yield, and methane content were 90%, 0.25 Nm3 CH4/kg COD removed, and 65%, respectively. Moreover, the activities of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were approximately 108% and 63% higher than those of the initial inoculum, respectively. After increasing OLR to 8.3 kg COD/m3/d, TVA was accumulated at 5,200 mg/L, leading to failure. The main organic acids were acetic acid (AA) and propionic acid (PA) with concentrations of 2,800 and 1,300 mg/L, respectively. Syntrophic methanogenic consortia (SMC) were augmented into the AHR to recover the system. After 4 days of bioaugmentation, the TVA concentration decreased to less than 500 mg/L. Bioaugmentation also increased the ratio of the methanogens and acetogens to total microorganisms at the end of the recovery period to 32% and 23%, respectively. The AHR can be recovered to operate at OLR of 7.6 kg COD/m3/d within 18 days with good performance and microbial balance."

      "abstract": "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Effective decontamination of denture base acrylic resin is essential for biofilm removal but can compromise the integrity of the material. Citric acid has shown promise as a potent antimicrobial agent, though its effectiveness as a denture cleanser is unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of citric acid on the surface properties and efficacy of biofilm removal on denture base acrylic resin compared with commonly used denture cleansers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 130 conventional, heat-processed denture base acrylic resin disks were randomly allocated into 1 of 5 groups based on the decontamination solution applied: control 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (SH), Periogard (chlorhexidine digluconate), effervescent denture cleansing tablets (Corega Tabs), and 10% citric acid (CA). Surface properties (roughness, hydrophilicity, microhardness, and color stability) were assessed at 3 time points: baseline (T0), after 5 minutes of exposure (T1), and after 1 week of exposure (T2) to the respective solution. A microcosm biofilm was formed on specimen surfaces to evaluate antimicrobial efficacy of the decontamination solution groups, through assessment of microbial viability, metabolic activity, biofilm dry weight, and morphology. A 2-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed for surface properties evaluations and for microbiological analysis, 1-way ANOVA was used (α=.05). RESULTS: No significant differences in average surface roughness (Ra) were observed between T0, T1, and T2 across all groups (P>.05). CA significantly increased surface hydrophilicity at T2 (P<.001) compared with the other groups. No significant differences in ΔE00 were seen among the groups: all values near the 50% perceptibility threshold. Compared with the control group, all denture cleansers significantly reduced the viability of total microorganisms and Candida species, with no viable colonies detected after treatment (P<.001). However, CA demonstrated a robust antimicrobial effect, with a significant reduction in biofilm dry weight and metabolic activity (P<.001), suggesting superior biofilm disruption compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Citric acid effectively increased hydrophilicity of conventional, heat-processed acrylic resin without negatively impacting surface roughness, microhardness, or color stability."

      "abstract": "This study successfully controlled the mechanical structure of chitosan films by regulating the interactions between chitosan molecules through variations in the concentration ratio of citric and acetic acids within the films. Additionally, precise drug release was achieved by adjusting the drying temperature during the synthesis. The key issue addressed is the challenge of achieving precise drug release control in biodegradable materials. Inaccurate drug release can lead to ineffective treatment or adverse side effects, limiting therapeutic efficacy and increasing healthcare challenges. The main objective was to fine-tune the films' composition and mechanical properties to achieve predictable control over drug release ratios. Our results show that increasing the concentration of citric acid enhanced the drug release ratio, while higher drying temperatures reduced the release ratio, likely due to structural changes in the film. Furthermore, structural changes in the chitosan films caused by varying the concentration ratio of citric acid to acetic acid enabled the successful control of the tensile strength and strain of the films. Additionally, we developed films capable of visually indicating the drug release ratio through color changes before and after release, providing a simple and effective method for real-time monitoring. Despite these promising results, challenges remain, such as improving the biocompatibility of films for use in complex biological environments. Future research will focus on enhancing durability, conducting further tests in biological systems, and exploring methods to increase the biocompatibility of films and their long-term performance."

      "abstract": "The condition known as colibacillosis is still very common in Indonesia, which means that laying hens affected by it are unable to achieve their peak egg production phase. Instead, their egg production is delayed and more susceptible to infection by other diseases. The goal of this study is to determine if the mixture of citric acid and dextrose can inhibit the growth of Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) bacteria in laying hens, ultimately leading to the control of colibacillosis cases in Indonesia. A total of 240 laying hen heads in all were split up into 6 treatments, each with 40 replications.The group received the following treatments: T0 is a treatment for laying hens free of APEC infection and they are given no drink that contains any mixture of citric acid and dextrose. T0 (-) is a treatment for laying hens free of APEC infection but a drink mixture of citric acid and dextrose is administered at a dose of 1 g/2.5 L of drinking water. T0 (+) is a treatment for laying hens infected with APEC up to 2 mL/head orally (3 × 108 CFU/mL) and given a drink without the mixture of citric acid and dextrose. T1 is a treatment for laying hens infected with APEC up 2 mL/head orally (3 × 108 CFU/mL) and given a mixture of citric acid and dextrose at a dose of 1 g/1.25 L of drinking water. T2 is a treatment for laying hens infected with APEC up to 2 mL/head orally (3 × 108 CFU/mL) and given a mixture of citric acid and dextrose at a dose of 1 g/2.5 L of drinking water. T3 is a treatment for laying hens infected with APEC up to 2 mL/head orally (3 × 108 CFU/mL) and given a mixture of citric acid and dextrose at a dose of 1 g/3.75 L of drinking water. The results of this study stated that the mixture of citric acid and dextrose showed a significant decrease in the appearance of the intestinal villi of laying hens, because the results were actually less good compared to the treatment infected with APEC. It is suspected that the dose given may still be excessive in concentration. This can be seen from the dose with the highest concentration range (T1) to the lowest (T3) which showed an image of intestinal villi that had a tendency to improve. Therefore, further research and studies are needed regarding the use of a mixture of citric acid and dextrose in laying hens infected with APEC with a lower dose."

Citric acid (CA) enhancement of egg white protein (EWP) foaming properties is proposed for the preparation of 3D-printed meringues. The results showed that CA increased the viscosity, exposure of hydrophobic groups (79.8% increase), and free sulfhydryl content (from 5 µmol/g to 34.8 µmol/g) of the EWP, thereby increasing the foaminess (from 50% to 178.2%). CA treatment increased the rates of adsorption, stretching, and orientation of EWP at the air-water interface to form multiple layers, resulting in a delay in foam thinning. The secondary structure of CA-treated EWP remained intact, and the exposure of amino acid residues in the tertiary structure increased with the expansion of the hydrophobic region. CA-treated EWP-prepared protein creams had a suitable viscosity (from 233.4 Pa·s to 1007 Pa·s at 0.1 s-1), shear thinning, structural restorability, and elasticity, which ensured good fidelity of their printed samples. Experiments involving 3D printing of CA-treated EWP showed that CA could significantly enhance the 3D printing fidelity of EWP. Our study could provide new ideas for the development of customizable 3D-printed foam food products."

      "abstract": "Sugarcane tops silage (STS), as a source of roughage for ruminants, is rich in water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content, which significantly affects silage quality. Citric acid (CA) is a low-cost natural antimicrobial agent that can inhibit undesirable microbes and improve silage quality. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of CA on the chemical composition, fermentation quality, microbial communities, and metabolic pathways of STS with high and low WSC contents before or after aerobic exposure. Fresh sugarcane tops with low-WSC [143.05 g/kg dry matter (DM)] and high-WSC (249.99 g/kg DM) contents were treated with and without CA and then ensiled for 125 days, followed by aerobic exposure for 4, 8, and 16 days. The results showed that high-WSC STS had lower crude protein (CP) content and higher DM, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents, whether treated with CA or not. CA-inoculated silage exhibited decreased DM loss and enterobacteria (EB) counts compared to the control. High-WSC STS treated with CA had higher WSC content and lower yeast count than those without CA inoculation. During the 0-16 days of aerobic exposure, the propionic acid and butyric acid contents in CA-inoculated silage were almost unchanged and ranged from 0 to 1 g/kg DM. Meanwhile, the ethanol content was almost unchanged and ranged from 0 to 1 g/kg DM only in low-WSC STS, irrespective of CA addition. Before aerobic exposure, CA inoculation decreased the abundances of undesirable microbes (e.g., Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12 and Paecilomyces) and animal pathogens, while amino acid metabolism was lower in high-WSC STS regardless of CA treatment. After aerobic exposure, CA inoculation increased the abundance of bacteria with antibacterial effects, including Paenibacillus and Bacillus. Moreover, the metabolism of energy and nucleotides was lower in high-WSC STS treated with CA, and the animal pathogens was lower in low-WSC STS treated with CA. In conclusion, CA inoculation could be effective in decreasing nutrients loss, improving fermentation quality, inhibiting harmful microorganisms, and modulating the metabolic pathways of microorganisms in STS with high and low WSC contents prior to and after aerobic exposure.",

The NADES used comprised citric acid-glucose-water (N1) or lactic acid-glucose-water (N2). The fractions rich in pectin obtained after exposure to NADES showed lower yield (≈4 g/100 g CA vs. ≈ 11 g/100 g CA), equal to or lower degree of methoxylation (53-71 mol/100 mol CA vs. 73 mol/100 mol CA), equal to or greater content of uronic acid (50-63 g/100 g CA vs. 51 g/100 g CA) than those isolated with CA, and the ones obtained from peel were the most thermally stable. These pectins showed greater linearity, shorter branch lengths, and lower arabinose content than those obtained with CA. The neutral sugars present in the highest concentration in all the isolated fractions were arabinose, xylose, galactose, and rhamnose. Glucose was also detected, probably due to contamination with starch. Their aqueous solutions showed pseudoplastic behavior. The effect of ultrasound assistance was preliminarily evaluated in the production of pectic fractions using N2, observing higher yields (13-18 g/100 g), in general, a higher concentration of uronic acid and a higher degree of methoxylation when compared with the extraction without US. They also showed greater arabinose content (less degradative treatment), lower glucose content (increased purity), and higher rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) content. It is known that RG-I is linked to pectin bioactivity and rheological behavior. The green solvent techniques assayed allowed obtaining fractions rich in uronic acid with different chemical, thermochemical, and rheological characteristics. In the case of isolation with NADES, the yield was low, but preliminary tests with ultrasound assistance showed that it is possible to overcome this limitation."

Genome sequencing of the five phages showed a total genome length of 76,153-144,768 bp. No virulent or drug-resistant genes were detected in the five phages. Bacterial inhibition testing of salmon fillets stored at 25 °C for 12 h showed that the number of V. parahaemolyticus decreased by 2.02 and 3.84 log CFU/g after treatment with a phage mixture, VPpMIx, and the combination of phage mixture VPpMIx and citric acid. In addition, phage VPpYZU64 combined with 600 μg/mL citric acid exhibited the highest biofilm reduction rate for V. parahaemolyticus. Collectively, our results show that combining phages and citric acid is a natural and efficient method of controlling V. parahaemolyticus growth in seafood."

This process is hampered in chronic wounds and wounds with delayed healing. Wound cover through skin grafting or a flap, or spontaneous healing through epithelization, requires healthy granulation tissue. Wound infection inhibits the formation of such tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 24 cases of chronic wounds with large raw areas that did not respond to conventional therapy for more than 3 weeks. Wounds were treated with 2% citric acid ointment with the aim of promoting healthy granulation and appropriate wound bed preparation. Infective agents, their sensitivity, and response to citric acid were studied. RESULTS: Thirty-two bacterial strains were isolated. The most common was Staphylococcus aureus (12, 37.5%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 25.0%). The majority of isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. The study's endpoint was the appearance of healthy granulation tissue suitable for split-thickness skin grafting or healing by secondary intention. Application of 2% citric acid ointment resulted in the formation of healthy granulation tissue in all cases after 3 to 20 applications. CONCLUSION: Citric acid ointment (2%) is highly effective in controlling infections and promoting formation of healthy granulation tissue.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to conduct a systematic study to evaluate the performance of citric acid (CA), an example of a commonly used organic acid in hair cosmetics, on different types of chemically treated hair and to better understand how CA works. METHODS: Consumer-centric routines were used to prepare the chemically treated hair, namely high-lift bleached, middle-lift bleached, permanently coloured and a combination of permed and coloured hair. Hair was subsequently treated with CA and hair reinforcement was investigated by physical techniques: High Pressure Differential Scanning Calorimetry (HPDSC), Miniature Tensile Test (MTT), Cyclic Fatigue Tensile Test (CFTT) & Micro X-ray Diffraction (μXRD) as well as chemical analysis (elemental, amino acids). RESULTS: CA treatment demonstrably enhances the structural integrity of chemically treated hair. DSC revealed increased crosslinking density of keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) in the hair cortex, evidenced by a 6.7% to 15.0% increase in denaturation temperature, varying with the specific chemical treatment. This improvement translates to enhanced mechanical properties, with tensile elastic modulus increasing by 7.5% to 23.5% and fatigue resistance (median cycles to break) improving by a remarkable 56% to 124%. Furthermore, CA treatment significantly reduced hair calcium levels by 21% to 42%. XRD analysis confirmed a reduction in the structure and quantity of crystallized calcium soaps following CA treatment. The observed performance improvements likely stem from a combination of mechanisms, including calcium chelation, the treatment's pH, and reinforcement of the non-covalent protein network. The precise interplay of these factors appears to be influenced by the type of pre-existing chemical treatment on the hair. CONCLUSION: CA effectively reinforces hair damaged by various common chemical treatments. However, these findings highlight the complex relationship between hair damage, chemical treatment type, and the efficacy of reinforcement strategies. The observed dependence of CA's performance on the level of pre-existing damage underscores the need for further research into developing targeted actives for consumers with specific and severe hair damage profiles. This opens exciting avenues for innovation in hair care tailored to individual needs."

Results demonstrated that a combined sanitizer of 0.1% SDS (1.0 ± 0.1 log reduction when used alone) and 1% CA (1.4 ± 0.3 log reduction when used alone) was highly effective in eliminating Salmonella biofilms from polyvinyl chloride pipes in hydroponic systems, reducing biofilm levels to below detectable limits (>5.6 log reduction when used in combination). Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed significantly greater proportions of damaged/dead cells in the 0.1% SDS- and 1% CA-treated samples (82.6 ± 2.6%) than in the single treatment with 0.1% SDS (26.1 ± 3.0%) and 1% CA (31.6 ± 2.5%) (P < 0.05). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy together with analysis of proteins and polysaccharides in the extracellular polymeric substances of the biofilm matrices showed that the treatment not only affected bacterial viability but also significantly reduced the biomass of the biofilm.

Herein, the microwave-assisted isolation, characterization and potential application of defibrillated lignocelluloses from depectinated blackcurrant pomace are reported. Depectination was achieved using citric acid (0.2-0.8 M, 80 °C, 2 h, conventional heating) and compared with acid-free hydrothermal microwave-assisted processing (1500 W, 100-160 °C, 30 min). The resultant depectinated residues were subjected to microwave-assisted hydrothermal defibrillation to afford two classes of materials: namely, (i) hydrothermal acid-free microwave-assisted (1500 W, 160 °C, 30 min; DFC-M1-M4), and (ii) hydrothermal citric acid microwave-assisted (1500 W, 160 °C, 30 min; DFC-C1-C4). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the thermal stability with respect to native BCP (Td = 330 °C) was higher for DFC-M1-M4 (Td = 345-348 °C) and lower for DFC-C1-C4 (322-325 °C). Both classes of material showed good propensity to hold water but failed to form stable hydrogels (5-7.5 wt% in water) unless they underwent bleaching which removed residual lignin and hemicellulosic matter, as evidenced by 13C solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The hydrogels made from bleached DFC-C1-C4 (7.5 wt%) and bleached DFC-M1-M4 (5 wt%) exhibited rheological viscoelastic, shear thinning, and time-dependent behaviour, which highlights the potential opportunity afforded by microwave-assisted defibrillation of BCP for food applications."

A total of 320 one-day-old mixed-sex (1:1) Thai KKU 1 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to five dietary treatments incorporating CABR at levels of 0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, and 12%. The chicks were fed for a period of 56 days, divided into three phases: 1-21, 22-49, and 50-56 days. In the grower phase, birds receiving 3% and 6% CABR displayed the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to other groups, while their body weight (BW) and BW gain (BWG) were significantly higher than those of other treatments (p < 0.05). In the finisher phase, performance differences were minimal, except for birds on the 3% CABR diet, which had greater BW than those on 9% or 12% CABR diets. Overall, throughout all phases, the inclusion of 3% CABR resulted in improved BWG and FCR compared to other groups across the study period (p < 0.05). Additionally, the 12% CABR treatment reduced dressing percentage compared to other groups, but it did not negatively impact the relative organ weights of the carcass or the quality of breast meat. Incorporating 3% and 12% CABR resulted in the highest values recorded for gross energy and ether extract in breast meat (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the gross energy of thigh meat increased with 3% to 12% CABR inclusion, peaking at the 6% CABR treatment (p < 0.05). This study found that adding 3% or 6% CABR to the diet of Thai broiler chickens improves their growth without negatively impacting meat or carcass quality."

Moench crude extract (EE) and citric acid (CA) against Cronobacter sakazakii isolated from powdered infant formula (PIF). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EE against C. sakazakii was determined, and then growth curve and time-kill analysis were used to screen the optimal antibacterial combination of 1 MIC of EE and CA. Changes in cell membrane potential, cell integrity, cell permeability, bacterial protein, DNA, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and cell morphology of C. sakazakii were used to reveal the synergistic inhibitory mechanism of EE and CA. The inactivation effect of EE in combination with CA against C. sakazakii on common contact surfaces was used to evaluate its efficacy as a natural disinfectant. The results showed that the MIC value of EE against C. sakazakii was 60 mg/mL, and the growth curve of C. sakazakii treated by 1 MIC of EE combined with CA (pH 3.0) was significantly inhibited compared with the control groups. The results of time-kill analysis showed that after combined treatment with 1 MIC of EE and CA (pH 3.0) for 30 min, approximately 8 log cfu/mL of C. sakazakii were inactivated. Cell membrane hyperpolarization, damaged cell membrane integrity, improved cell membrane permeability, decreased bacterial protein and DNA levels, increased and then decreased intracellular ROS contents, and deformed and ruptured cell morphology were found in C. sakazakii treated by EE combined with CA, and these phenomena were more pronounced than in C. sakazakii treated by EE or CA alone. When inoculated stainless steel, glass, ceramic, polystyrene, bamboo, and wood were sprayed with 1 MIC of EE combined with CA (pH 3.0) and after 15 min of treatment, approximately 5 log cfu/mL of C. sakazakii were inactivated. These findings suggest that EE combined with CA can effectively inactivate C. sakazakii isolated from PIF and can be used as a natural disinfectant to reduce the contamination of C. sakazakii in PIF production environments or households.",

Owing to its high sensitivity to oxidation and hydrolysis, formulation studies are required to maintain the physicochemical stability of lifitegrast. This study aimed to overcome the instability of lifitegrast by developing a more stable eyedrop formulation by using citric acid and tromethamine to prevent the degradation of lifitegrast. METHODS: Based on the Design of Experiment (DoE) approach, formulations were prepared at various concentrations of two stabilizers, citric acid and tromethamine. The stabilizers were carefully controlled to reduce the generation of degradation products. The eyedrops were stored under accelerated test conditions, and parameters such as appearance, pH, drug content, and impurities were evaluated. RESULTS: The results showed that all critical quality attributes (CQAs) including appearance, pH, drug content, and impurities were maintained at stable levels under accelerated conditions, meeting established criteria. In addition, it was suggested that citric acid provided protection against oxidative stress, while tromethamine prevented hydrolysis caused by pH fluctuations. CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, it was concluded that the developed lifitegrast-containing eyedrop formulation exhibited improved physicochemical stability, validated through statistical analyses. These findings contribute to the development of stable eyedrops and provide a foundation for commercial production and clinical applications."

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of new, potential fire-retardant materials. Specifically, the study examined the combination of tripotassium citrate (TPC), a water-soluble and bio-based fire retardant, with sorbitol and citric acid (SorCA), an eco-friendly thermosetting resin previously studied. While TPC is known to control combustion, its application in wood modification has not been thoroughly researched. To assess the fixation and flammability of these fire retardants, tests were conducted on Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), including chemical analysis, dimensional stability, mechanical properties, flame retardancy, and leaching tests. The combination of SorCA and TPC showed high weight percent gain (WPG) values; however, leaching and anti-swelling efficiency (ASE) tests revealed challenges in fixation stability. The dynamic mechanical properties were reduced, whereas the static strength values were in the same range compared with untreated wood. While TPC exhibited high flame retardancy prior to leaching, its efficacy diminished post-leaching, underscoring challenges in fixation and the need for improved retention strategies. Bunsen burner tests conducted on leached specimens indicated enhanced performance even under severe leaching conditions as per the EN 84:2020 procedure. However, cone calorimetry measurements showed less favorable outcomes, emphasizing the necessity for further investigation into optimizing TPC retention and enhancing treatment efficacy."

      "abstract": "Citric acid (CA) is well-known for mitigating cadmium (Cd) toxicity in plants. Yet, the underlying mechanisms driving growth promotion, Cd detoxification/tolerance, and enhanced phytoremediation processes remain incompletely understood. This study investigated the effects of CA application (2.5 mM) on Brassica napus grown in Cd-contaminated (30 mg kg-1) growth medium through a controlled pot experiment. Cd exposure alone significantly impaired various plant physiological parameters in B. napus. Whereas CA application significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced physiological attributes, Cd detoxification and tolerance by modulating key genes involved in photosynthesis and Cd transport, including the metal-transporting P1B-type ATPases (Cd/zinc heavy metal-transporting ATPase 1; HMA1) and light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding 3 (LHCB3). Notably, CA application increased Cd accumulation in stems and leaves by 4% and 35%, respectively, enhancing bioconcentration factors (BCF) by 12% in stems and 40% in leaves while reducing root BCF by 10%. This translocation was facilitated by the upregulation of HMA4, HMA2, and plant Cd resistance (PCR2) genes in plant leaves, improving Cd mobility within the plant. Furthermore, CA induced a 34% increase in phytochelatins and a 32% upregulation in metallothioneins, accompanied by a significant reduction in oxidative stress markers, including a 40% decrease in hydrogen peroxide and a 44% decline in malondialdehyde levels in leaves. Enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and osmolyte accumulation further contributed to improved Cd detoxification/sequestration in leaves, reduced oxidative stress, and improved photosynthetic efficiency, resulting in enhanced plant biomass production and Cd tolerance. Transcriptomic analysis showed that CA treatment substantially influenced the expression of 12,291 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 750 common genes consistently downregulated in CK vs Cd treatment group but upregulated in Cd vs Cd-CA treatment group. Additionally, CA modulated 11 DEGs associated with 32 gene ontologies in the citrate pathway under Cd stress, highlighting its targeted regulatory effect on metabolic pathways involved in Cd stress response. This study offers novel insights into the synergistic role of CA in promoting plant growth and regulating Cd uptake in B. napus, highlighting its potential to enhance phytoremediation strategies.",

Thermoplastic-based 3D-printed scaffolds offer a bioresorbable, biocompatible, and mechanical strong implant system.

In this study, we developed dual functionalized scaffolds with osteogenic and antibacterial properties by immobilizing citric acid-linked chitosan on oxygen plasma etched 3D-printed PLA scaffolds through an EDC-NHS coupling reaction. Acellular mineralization of these scaffolds in DMEM demonstrated the deposition of crystalline hydroxyapatite. In addition, the antibacterial properties of these surface-modified scaffolds have been determined against E. coli and S. aureus, where the citric-linked chitosan biofunctionalized 3D-printed PLA scaffolds showed significantly higher antibacterial activity in comparison to oxygen-etched PLA and PLA scaffolds due to the synergistic effect of citric acid and chitosan functionalities. MG-63 cells exhibited increased proliferation and osteogenic activity on the modified scaffolds compared to the PLA and OP-PLA.

Bacillus species are commonly used for fermenting and improving the nutritional quality of feedstuffs or by-products. An experiment was conducted to enhance the nutritional value of citric acid by-products through fermentation with Bacillus subtilis I9 for animal feed. The experiment was carried out in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 50 g of substrate and 200 mL of sterile water. Groups were either uninoculated or inoculated with B. subtilis I9 at 107 CFU/mL. Incubation occurred at 37 °C with automatic shaking at 150 rpm under aerobic conditions for 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Inoculation with B. subtilis I9 significantly increased Bacillus density to 9.3 log CFU/mL at 24 h (p < 0.05). CMCase activity gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 9.77 U/mL at 72 h. After 96 h of fermentation with inoculated B. subtilis I9, the citric acid by-product exhibited a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in crude fiber by 10.86%, hemicellulose by 20.23%, and cellulose by 5.98%, but an increase in crude protein by 21.89%. Gross energy decreased by 4% after inoculation with B. subtilis in comparison to the uninoculated control (p < 0.05). Additionally, the non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) degradation due to inoculation with B. subtilis I9 significantly reduced (p < 0.05) NSP by 24.37%, while galactose, glucose, and uronic acid decreased by 22.53%, 32.21%, and 18.11%, respectively. Amino acid profile content increased significantly by more than 12% (p < 0.05), including indispensable amino acids such as histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and valine and dispensable amino acids like alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, and tyrosine. Furthermore, citric acid by-products inoculated with B. subtilis I9 exhibited changes in the cell wall structure under scanning electron microscopy, including fragmentation and cracking. These results suggest that fermenting citric acid by-products with B. subtilis I9 effectively reduces dietary fiber content and improves the nutritional characteristics of citric acid by-products for use in animal feed."

      "abstract": "Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism and is a key biomarker for various diseases. Under normal conditions, there is a balance between its production and excretion. Its higher concentration can cause inflammation and severe pain, which makes it necessary to monitor its level for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of various pathological conditions. The current work reports on the synthesis of a copper-doped biochar (Cu@BC) nanocomposite and its functionalization with citric acid. The synthesis of the mimic enzyme was confirmed through various spectroscopic techniques. The nanozyme catalyzes hydrogen peroxide to oxidize tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with an optical change from colorless to blue-green. This optical transformation was confirmed through a UV-vis spectrophotometer, which gave an expected λ max of 652 nm characteristic of TMBoxi. The incorporation of uric acid into this reaction mixture resulted in the reduction of TMBoxi to TMBred, accompanied by an optical change from blue-green to colorless, which was again confirmed with a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The fabricated sensor's performance was finely-tuned to report on its various key components. The best response was achieved at 2 mg of the nanozyme, pH 6, time 150 seconds, TMB, and hydrogen peroxide 0.9 and 1.5 mM, respectively. Under the above-mentioned optimized conditions, the fabricated sensor detected uric acid in the range of 1-90 μM with limits of detection and quantification of 0.17 and 0.58 μM, respectively, with an R 2 of 0.997. The proposed sensor was highly selective and successfully detected uric acid in real sample solutions."

      "abstract": "A novel citric acid (CA) modulation strategy was developed to prepare strong magnetic CoFe-LDH/CoFe2O4-C composites, which were combined with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) to effectively degrade levofloxacin (LEV) in wastewater. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) test showed that CA modulation facilitated a more powerful internal electric field to drive rapid charge migration. The addition of CoFe-LDH/CoFe2O4-C increased LEV degradation from 78.2 % to 98.6 % and reduced energy efficiency from 24.77 to 8.93 kWh m-3. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra showed the CoFe-LDH/CoFe2O4-C could take full advantage of the active substances originating from DBD plasma and highlighted the role of 1O2 and ·O2-. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the heterojunction can not only drive faster electron migration but also reduce the energy barrier of O3 decomposition. Possible degradation pathways for LEV were proposed. This study opened up a new avenue for the synthesis of applicable catalysts for plasma systems in water treatment areas."

Uncontrolled comorbidities and certain drugs (immunosuppressants and antiproliferative chemotherapeutic agents) hamper the process of wound healing. Sutured wounds need prolonged duration of dressings and management as well as repeated hospital visits. In addition, appropriate reconstructive procedures may be needed to cover the wound. All these factors ultimately add to the cost of care. CASE REPORT: A simple, yet effective option for the management of a refractory chronic postoperative raw area in a surgical case of breast carcinoma is reported. Acceptable wound healing was eventually achieved without disturbing the patient's chemotherapy cycles, and a major reconstructive procedure was avoided. CONCLUSION: Citric acid treatment can be a cost-effective, safe, efficient, and novel option to promote faster granulation and epithelialization and may avoid the need for major reconstructive surgery.",

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed that the chemical treatment introduced carboxylic groups to cellulose fibers. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the crystallinity of cellulose was reduced. The average fiber length and water retention value of the pulp decreased with increasing CA dosage under the conditions of 3 mL/g CA4 (4 wt% CA), and the drainage performance of the cellulose pulp improved by 21 %. Also, the crosslinking of fibers contributed to the mechanical properties of the cellulosic matrix, increasing the dry and wet strength by 21 % and 282 %, respectively.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a variant of the bio-electro-chemical system that uses microorganisms as biocatalysts to generate bioenergy by oxidizing organic matter. Due to its two-prong feature of simultaneously treating wastewater and generating electricity, it has drawn extensive interest by scientific communities around the world. However, the pollution purifying capacity and power production of MFC at the laboratory scale have tended to remain steady, and there have been no reports of a performance breakthrough. PROBLEM STATEMENT: This research was conducted to produce electricity and evaluate the efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal from wastewater containing Citric Acid using a two-chamber microbial fuel cell without an intermediary. METHODOLOGY: In this research, citric acid factory wastewater was used as the substrate, graphite as the electrode, Nafion membrane for proton transfer from anode to cathode, and grape waste as a carbon source. These Experiments were performed at room temperature and neutral pH. Also, the effect of three independent variables mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS), Carbon: Nitrogen: Phosphorus stoichiometric ratio (COD:TKN:P), and grape waste on electricity production and wastewater treatment was investigated. Then, the optimal values of each variable were determined under favorable conditions for electricity generation and COD reduction. RESULTS: The MFC was conducted at the optimal values of MLSS 1400 mg/L, the stoichiometric ratio of COD:TKN:P 140:10:1, and the grape waste dose of 1.4 g/L. At these conditions, the obtained maximum power density and current density were 18228.10 µW/m2 and 244.44 mA/m2, respectively. The maximum COD removal was 72% achieved in the values of MLSS 1400 mg/L, the stoichiometric ratio of COD:TKN:P equal to 260:10:1, and 1.4 g/L of grape waste. The maximum open circuit voltage was also recorded as 678 mV, obtained at MLSS 3000 mg/L, the stoichiometric ratio of COD:TKN:P equal to 200:10:1, and for a grape waste dose of 2 g/L. CONCLUSION: The results of this research showed that the use of grape waste to supply glucose to microorganisms in the MFC system has a significant effect on increasing energy production and COD removal, and it is recommended to conduct additional research in the future to improve the efficiency. However, scalability and practical application potential of these integrated technologies are the challenges towards their real-world applications in small scale trials.",

Applications for anodic oxide coatings on aluminum alloys include the space environment. In this work, the aluminum alloys 2024-T3 (Al-Cu), 6061-T6 (Al-Mg-Si), and 7075-T6 (Al-Zn) were prepared by hard anodizing electrochemical treatment using citric and sulfur acid baths at different concentrations. The aim of the work is to observe the effect of citric acid on the microstructure of the substrate, the mechanical properties, the corrosion resistance, and the morphology of the hard anodic layers. Hard anodizing was performed on three different aluminum alloys using three citric-sulfuric acid mixtures for 60 min and using current densities of 3.0 and 4.5 A/dm2. Vickers microhardness (HV) measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to determine the mechanical characteristics and microstructure of the hard anodizing material, and electrochemical techniques to understand the corrosion kinetics. The result indicates that the aluminum alloy 6061-T6 (Al-Mg-Si) has the maximum hard-coat thickness and hardness. The oxidation of Zn and Mg during the anodizing process found in the 7075-T6 (Al-Zn) alloy promotes oxide formation. Because of the high copper concentration, the oxide layer that forms on the 2024-T6 (Al-Cu) Al alloy has the lowest thickness, hardness, and corrosion resistance. Citric and sulfuric acid solutions can be used to provide hard anodizing in a variety of aluminum alloys that have corrosion resistance and mechanical qualities on par with or better than traditional sulfuric acid anodizing."

In this work, biobased films from stable polyelectrolyte complex suspensions (PECs) of xylan and chitosan (70 Xyl/30 Ch wt% mass ratio), at different concentrations of citric acid (CA) (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 wt%), were prepared and characterized. Films were treated at two temperatures (135 °C, 155 °C) and times (30 min, 60 min) to promote covalent crosslinking. Esterification and amidation reactions were confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Confocal Raman Microscopy. Water resistance and dry and wet stress-strain results were markedly increased by thermal treatment, mainly at 155 °C. The presence of 5 wt% CA tended to increase dry and wet stress-strain values further, up to 88 MPa-10% (155 °C for 60 min), and 5.6 MPa-40% (155 °C for 30 min), respectively. The UV-blocking performance of the films was improved by all treatments, as was thermal stability (up to Tonset: 230 °C). Contact angle values were between 73 and 84°, indicating partly wettable surfaces. Thus, thermal treatment at low CA concentrations represents a good alternative for improving the performance of Xyl/Ch films."

      "abstract": "Contamination of agricultural soils with heavy metals (HMs) poses a significant environmental threat, especially because industrial discharges often irrigate agricultural lands. A prominent source of HM(s) pollution occurs from tannery effluents containing high concentrations of chromium (Cr) in both Cr3+ and Cr6+ forms along with other toxic materials. Cr is known for its carcinogenic and mutagenic properties in biological systems. Microbe-assisted phytoremediation has emerged as a promising and environmentally friendly approach for detoxifying Cr-contaminated environments. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of citric acid (CA) and a Cr-reducing bacterial strain (Staphylococcus aureus) on the phytoextraction potential of Lemna minor within a Constructed Wetland System treated with tannery wastewater. Various combinations of tannery wastewater (0, 50, and 100 %), CA (0, 5 and 10 mM), and microbial inoculants were applied to the test plants. The mitigative effects of Staphylococcus aureus strain K1 were examined in combination with different concentrations of CA (0, 5, 10 mM). Data on growth and yield attributes highlighted the beneficial effects of bacterial inoculation and CA in ameliorating Cr toxicity in L. minor, as evidenced by increased foliar chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, POD, APX, CAT), and improved nutrient uptake. Specifically, CA application resulted in an enhancement of Cr ranging from 12% to 15% and 23%-31% in concentration, and 134%-141% and 322%-337% in Cr accumulation, respectively. When combined with the S. aureus inoculation treatment, CA application (5 and 10 mM) further increased the concentration and accumulation of Cr in L. minor. The enhancement in Cr ranged from 12% to 23% and 27%-41% in concentration, 68%-75%, and 179%-185% in accumulation, respectively. These results demonstrated that L. minor is an effective choice for environmentally friendly Cr remediation due to its continued ability to grow in polluted wastewater. This study suggested that microbial-assisted phytoextraction combined with chelating agents such as CA could be a practical and effective approach for remediating tannery effluents."

      "abstract": "GFRS is the conversion product of Panax ginseng Meyer berry after citric acid heat treatment, which is rich in rare ginsenosides. However, the anti-melanin role of GFRS in the regulation of skin pigmentation and its material basis remains unclear. To compare the anti-melanin activity before and after citric acid heat treatment, we determined the effects of GFS and GFRS on tyrosinase activity and melanin lever under α-MSH stimulation and found the potential anti-melanin effect of GFRS. Further, Western blot and immunofluorescence methods were used to reveal the mechanism by which GFRS detects anti-melanin activity by promoting autophagy flux levels. In zebrafish models, GFRS inhibited endogenous melanin and tyrosinase better than arbutin and promoted the accumulation of autophagy levels in vivo. To determine the material basis of the anti-melanin effect of GFRS, HPLC was used to isolate and prepare 12 ginsenosides from GFRS, and their activity evaluation and structure-activity relationship analysis were performed. The results showed that the inhibitory effect of GFRS on melanin was Rg3 > Rg5 > Rk1 > Rd. Molecular docking showed that their docking fraction with mushroom tyrosinase was significantly better than that of arbutin, but the presence of C-20 glycosylation decreased the anti-melanin activity of Rd. To maximize the content of Rg3, Rg5, and Rk1, we optimized the process by using citric acid heat treatment of ginsenoside Rd and found that citric acid heat treatment at 100°C almost completely transformed Rd and obtained a high content of active ingredients. In summary, our data demonstrated that GFRS exerted anti-melanin effects by inducing autophagy. It was further revealed that Rg3, Rg5, and Rk1, as effective active components, could be enriched by the improved process of converting ginsenoside Rd by citric acid heat treatment.",

This in-vitro study aimed to assess the viability and number of attached cultured Human Periodontal Ligament Cells (HPLC) on the dehydrated root surface of simulated avulsed teeth treated with citric acid and EDTA solutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sound human permanent teeth were included in the study. The root portions of the teeth were sectioned into slices, air-dried for 1 h, and divided into the following three groups: Group A-control; Group B-Citric acid treated for 30 min; Group C-EDTA treated for 5 min. The slices were then placed in cultured HPLC. After a 24-h incubation period, the slices were visualized under the microscope and prepared for reading the viable and dead HPLC using a spectrofluorometer, as well as for counting HPLC in a Neubauer Chamber. RESULTS: The spectrofluorometer intensity for viable and dead HPLC showed a statistically significant difference (p = .003 and p = .002), with the mean intensity for viable HPLC greater in citric acid group (69.52 ± 74.51), followed by EDTA group (31.39 ± 9.12), and control group (-130.93 ± 30.99). The dead HPLC intensity was greater in the EDTA group (19.43 ± 47.31), followed by the citric acid group (1.28 ± 1.85), and the control group (-2.77 ± 0.76). The total number of cells in the Neubauer chamber showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001), with a higher count in the citric acid group (10.83 ± 4.08) followed by EDTA group (2.92 ± 2.92). CONCLUSION: The application of citric acid for 30 min on the dehydrated root surface of avulsed teeth demonstrated superior outcomes compared to both EDTA treatment for 5 min and the control group.",

      "abstract": "Anti-inflammatory wound healing involves targeted drug delivery to the wound site using hydrogel materials to prolong drug effectiveness. In this work, hydrogel films were fabricated using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) crosslinked with citric acid (CA) and glutaraldehyde (GA) at different concentrations. The crosslinker densities were optimized with various CA (2-10% w/v) and GA (1-5% v/v) concentrations. The optimized crosslink densities in the hydrogel exhibited additional functional group peaks in the FT-IR spectra at 1740 cm-1 for the C=O stretching of the ester linkage in CA and at 1060 cm-1 for the C-O-C stretching of the ether group in GA. Significantly, the internal porous structures of hydrogel composite films improved density, swelling capacities, solubility percentage reduction, and decreased water retention capacities with optimized crosslinker densities. Therefore, these hydrogel composite films were utilized as drug carriers for controlled drug release within 24 h during medical treatment. Moreover, the hydrogel films demonstrated increased triamcinolone acetonide (TAA) absorption with higher crosslinker density, resulting in delayed drug release and improved TAA efficiency in anti-inflammatory activity. As a result, the modified hydrogel showed the capability of being an alternative material with enhanced anti-inflammatory efficiency with hydrogel films."

      "abstract": "Enhancing the hydrophilicity and UV protective property of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric are two significant ways to upgrade its quality and enlarge the applicable area. Biobased finishes are greatly welcomed for the fabrication of sustainable textiles; however, their application on PET fabric is still challenging compared with the case of natural fabric. This study presents a strategy that immobilizes epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) onto PET fabric using citric acid (CA) for durably hydrophilic and UV-proof properties with negligible color change. A controllable surface-activating method integrating alkaline and deep eutectic solvent (DES) is customized for the PET fabric to promote the reactions among PET, CA, and EGCG. The hydrophilic, antistatic, and UV protective properties of functionalized PET fabric were explored. Results show that the hydrophilicity of the PET fabric after direct EGCG treatment increases but drops sharply after first-round washing due to weak interactions. The combined alkaline/DES pretreatment increases the number of hydrophilic groups and the roughness of PET fibers. After EGCG modification, the moisture regain (MR) of PET fabric increases from 0.41 to 0.64%. The contact angle and electrostatic charge half-life (T1/2) decreases from >120 to 23°, and from >60 to 0.13 s, respectively. The MR and T1/2 are well retained after a 10-cycle washing. In addition, the UV protective factor of the PET fabric increases from 18 to 36. A very slight yellowing phenomenon occurs on the PET fabric after the treatment. In all, this research attempts to integrate a biobased finishing agent and an eco-friendly cross-linker on synthetic fiber for durable functions, which is transferrable to the sustainable fabrication of other polymeric materials such as fibers or films.",

      "abstract": "Red mud is a highly alkaline solid waste discharged from the alumina industry, and its high sodium content is the key factor limiting its wide utilization. Therefore, effective control of the \"frosting\" phenomenon during the application of red mud has received significant attention. In this study, the changes of particle size, phase, morphology, and pore size of red mud after sodium removal with different amounts of citric acid pretreatment were investigated. The single-factor experiment shows that the Na+ leaching rate is 86.33% under a citric acid dosage of 15%, liquid-to-solid ratio of 7 mL/g, leaching temperature of 80 °C, stirring speed of 300 rpm, and leaching time of 10 min. The leachate is characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The results reveal that Na+ mainly exists in a combined state in the form of cancrinite. With the increase of citric acid dosage, red mud agglomerates, calcite, and cancrinite are dissolved, and new phases such as calcium oxalate and magnesium aluminum hydroxide are formed. The specific surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter show irregular changes with the increase in the citric acid dosage. Citric acid pretreatment can effectively reduce the sodium content in red mud, the treatment cost of leaching solution is low, and the leaching residue is neutral, which is helpful to promote the practical application of red mud.",

Biodegradable, biocompatible, and antibacterial films exhibited pH dependence in the release of ellagic acid for up to 24 h. In mice model, PPE/CA/β-CD/CMS hydrogel film treatment showed promising wound healing effects, including increased collagen deposition, reduced inflammation, activation of the Wingless-related integration site (wnt) pathway leading to cell division, proliferation, and migration to the wound site. The expression of the WNT3A gene did not show any significant differences among all the studied groups. Developed PPE-loaded CA/β-CD/CMS film promoted wound healing by epithelialization, granulation tissue thickness, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, hence could be recommended as a biodegradable and antibacterial hydrogel platform to improve the cell proliferation during the healing of diabetic wounds.",

Three dimensional sealing of the root canal is one of the main goals of endodontic treatment and is essential for preventing reinfection of the canal and for preserving the health of the periapical tissues, Recently Epoxy resin sealers have been used because of their reduced solubility apical seal and micro-retention to root dentine. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study was done to evaluate and compare the apical sealability of AH Plus and RealSeal SE using 5.25% sodium hypochlorite with 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid as irrigants. Materials and methods: 44 single-rooted premolars were selected and the teeth are randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10) and 2 control groups (n=2). The extent of dye penetration, from the apical to the coronal part of the root canal, was assessed using a stereomicroscope at 10x magnification for all groups.One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to compare statistically significant differences among the groups, using SPSS software version 10.0. RESULTS: Group IV (Citric acid + RealSeal SE) showed a statistically lower mean microleakage when compared to all other groups. CONCLUSION: From, the present study, it was concluded that, RealSeal SE sealer with 10% citric acid as irrigant (group IV) showed better apical sealability followed by RealSeal SE sealer with 17% EDTA as irrigant (group III), when compared to AH Plus groups which showed least sealability."

Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was applied to analyze changes, and the push-out bond strength test was used to measure dentin adhesion of Well-Root ST, a bioceramic root canal sealer. METHODS: A total of 80 extracted single-rooted lower premolar teeth were included in this study and randomly divided into four groups (n=20): group 1 (17% EDTA), group 2 (10% CA), group 3 (18% HEDP), and group 4 (distilled water, control). After irrigation and drying, SEM-EDS was applied to analyze eight samples from each group at coronal, middle, and apical root regions for mineral content and SEM images. The remaining 12 samples underwent a push-out bond strength test using Well-Root ST sealer and gutta-percha. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between groups (P<0.05). SEM-EDS showed significant differences in C, O, Ca, P, and Ca/P content, with no significant differences in Na and Mg. Push-out bond strength was significantly higher in the 17% EDTA, 10% CA, and 18% HEDP groups compared to the control group, with no significant differences between chelating agents. CONCLUSION: Chelating agents altered root dentin mineral content and improved the adhesive properties of the bioceramic sealer. These findings highlight the importance of considering the selection and use of chelating agents in the clinical practice for root canal treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of a 50% ascorbic acid with 50% citric acid solution on the immediate shear bond strength (SBS) of metallic brackets after tooth bleaching. The enamel etching pattern and the required quantity of these combined acids as antioxidants following 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP) bleaching were also determined. METHODS: The stability of the solution at room temperature was assessed at various time intervals. Fifty teeth were randomly divided into five groups: non-bleached (G1), bleached then acid etched (G2), bleached followed by a 10-minute treatment with 10% sodium ascorbate and acid etched (G3), 5-minute treatment with 50% ascorbic acid (G4), and 5-minute treatment with a combination of 50% ascorbic acid and 50% citric acid (G5). Groups G2, G3, G4 and G5 were bleached by 35% HP gel for a total of 32 min. Acid etching in groups G1, G2, and G3 was performed using 37% phosphoric acid (Ormco®, Orange, CA, USA) for 15 s. In all groups, metal brackets were immediately bonded using Transbond™ XT primer and Transbond™ PLUS adhesive, with light curing for 40 s. The SBS was tested with a universal testing machine, and statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05 for all statistical tests. RESULTS: Stability tests demonstrated that the combined acids remained effective for up to 21 days. Group G5 significantly increased the SBS of bleached teeth to the level of G1 (p < 0.05), while G3 did not achieve the same increase in SBS (p > 0.05). SEM analysis revealed enamel etching patterns similar to those of both control groups (G1 and G2). Kinetic studies at 6 min indicated that the antioxidation in G5 reacted 0.2 mmole lower than in G3 and G4. CONCLUSION: 5-minute application of the combined acids enhanced the SBS of bleached teeth comparable to unbleached teeth. The combined acids remain stable over two weeks, presenting a time-efficient, single-step solution for antioxidant application and enamel etching in orthodontic bracket bonding.",

As a promising solution, guided tissue remineralization can induce the formation of apatite nanocrystals to repair defects in the dentin bonding interface. In this study, we present an experimental 20 wt % citric acid (CA) dental etching agent that removes the smear layer. After CA-etching, approximately 3.55 wt % residual CA formed a strong bond with collagen fibrils, reducing the interfacial energy between the remineralizing solution and dentin. CA helped achieve almost complete intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization after 24 h of mineralization. CA also significantly promoted poly(amidoamine)-induced dentin biomimetic mineralization. The elastic modulus and microhardness of remineralized dentin were restored to that of sound dentin. The remineralized interface reduced microleakage and provided a stronger, longer-lasting bond than conventional phosphate acid-etching. The newly developed CA dental etching agents promoted rapid dentin biomimetic mineralization and improved bonding efficacy through interfacial control, representing a new approach with clinical practice implications.",

      "abstract": "Botrytis cinerea is a typical necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungus which can deliberately acidify host tissues and trigger oxidative bursts therein to facilitate its virulence. The white collar complex (WCC), consisting of BcWCL1 and BcWCL2, is recognized as the primary light receptor in B. cinerea. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms through which the WCC components, particularly BcWCL2 as a GATA transcription factor, control virulence are not yet fully understood. This study demonstrates that deletion of BcWCL2 results in the loss of light-sensitive phenotypic characteristics. Additionally, the Δbcwcl2 strain exhibits reduced secretion of citrate, delayed infection cushion development, weaker hyphal penetration, and decreased virulence. The application of exogenous citric acid was found to restore infection cushion formation, hyphal penetration, and virulence of the Δbcwcl2 strain. Transcriptome analysis at 48 h post-inoculation revealed that two citrate synthases, putative citrate transporters, hydrolytic enzymes, and reactive oxygen species scavenging-related genes were down-regulated in Δbcwcl2, whereas exogenous citric acid application restored the expression of the above genes involved in the early infection process of Δbcwcl2. Moreover, the expression of Bcvel1, a known regulator of citrate secretion, tissue acidification, and secondary metabolism, was down-regulated in Δbcwcl2 but not in Δbcwcl1. ChIP-qPCR and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that BcWCL2 can bind to the promoter sequences of Bcvel1. Overexpressing Bcvel1 in Δbcwcl2 was found to rescue the mutant defects. Collectively, our findings indicate that BcWCL2 regulates the expression of the global regulator Bcvel1 to influence citrate secretion, tissue acidification, redox homeostasis, and virulence of B. cinerea.IMPORTANCEThis study illustrated the significance of the fungal blue light receptor component BcWCL2 protein in regulating citrate secretion in Botrytis cinerea. Unlike BcWCL1, BcWCL2 may contribute to redox homeostasis maintenance during infection cushion formation, ultimately proving to be essential for full virulence. It is also demonstrated that BcWCL2 can regulate the expression of Bcvel1 to influence host tissue acidification, citrate secretion, infection cushion development, and virulence. While the role of organic acids secreted by plant pathogenic fungi in fungus-host interactions has been recognized, this paper revealed the importance, regulatory mechanisms, and key transcription factors that control organic acid secretion. These understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism of plant pathogens can provide valuable insights for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies against fungal diseases.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in patients with Parkinson's disease. The incidence of silent aspiration is high in such patients owing to decreased pharyngeal and laryngeal sensation; thus, interventions for this condition may help prevent pneumonia. In this single-arm, open-label study, we used a cervical percutaneous interferential current stimulation device to activate pharyngeal and laryngeal sensory nerves. We evaluated its effectiveness in patients with Hoehn-Yahr stages 2-4 Parkinson's disease. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a normal cough reflex after consuming 1% citric acid at the end of the intervention compared with baseline measurements. In total, 25 patients received neck percutaneous interferential current stimulation for 20 min twice weekly for 8 weeks. Afterward, the proportion of patients with a normal cough reflex after 1% citric acid consumption increased significantly (p = 0.001), whereas other indicators, such as tongue pressure, peak expiratory flow, and penetration or aspiration during videofluoroscopic examination, remained unchanged.

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of dehydration and utilization processes for citric acid dewatered sludge is hampered by its high concentrations of polysaccharides, proteins, and water-binding properties of microbial extracellular polymers (EPS). This research explores the efficacy and mechanisms involved in extracting water from this type of sludge using biological drying technology, with varying rates of ventilation. Especially pertinent was the use of low ventilation rates as control variables. Our results suggest that a scheduled intermittent ventilation at lower rates allows for the most efficient removal of water, achieving a rate of 41.71 % within eight days, according to the zero-order kinetic model. Remarkably, the peak temperature registered was 60 °C, reaching this threshold in just 0.1 days and maintaining high temperatures for approximately 5.9 days. Component analysis of organic matter illustrated a preferential degradation process for lipids under these ventilation conditions which is pivotal for releasing and transforming bound water for efficient extraction, as well as facilitating the breakdown of easily hydrolysable materials. Further, polysaccharide/protein (EPS) decomposition contributed to water removal, though less significantly. The periodic ventilation strategy allowed for the maximum cumulative temperature to be sustained, demonstrating superior efficiency in harnessing bio-generated heat (82.77 % for water evaporation), resulting in dry sludge suitable for self-sustained combustion at relatively low cost ($26.61/t). Highlighted by this study is the considerable potential of energy-efficient ventilation methods in the biological drying treatment of citric acid fermented sludge and similar industrial waste materials.",

Based on previous studies, the small compound with its three carboxylic groups can be considered a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. YopH, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, is an essential virulence factor in Yersinia bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed enzymatic activity assays of YopH phosphatase after treatment with citric acid in comparison with the inhibitory compound trimesic acid, which has a similar structure. We also measured the cytotoxicity of these compounds in Jurkat T E6.1 and macrophage J774.2 cell lines. We performed molecular docking analysis of the binding of citric acid molecules to YopH phosphatase. RESULTS: Citric acid and trimesic acid reversibly reduced the activity of YopH enzyme and decreased the viability of Jurkat and macrophage cell lines. Importantly, these two compounds showed greater inhibitory properties against bacterial YopH activity than against human CD45 phosphatase activity. Molecular docking simulations confirmed that citric acid could bind to YopH phosphatase. CONCLUSION: Citric acid, a known antioxidant, can be considered an inhibitor of bacterial phosphatases.",

In this study, ramie bone cellulose (RB-CE) was obtained in one step using a simple and ecologically friendly hydrogen peroxide-citric acid (HPCA) treatment procedure that avoided the use of halogenated reagents and strong acids while also streamlining the treatment processes. Various analytical methods were used to investigate the chemical composition and structure, crystallinity, morphology, thermal properties, surface area and hydration properties of cellulose separated at different treatment temperatures. HPCA successfully removed lignin and hemicellulose from RB, according to chemical composition analysis and FTIR. RB-CE had a type I cellulose crystal structure, and the crystallinity improved with increasing treatment temperature, reaching 72.51 % for RB-CE90. The RB-CE showed good thermal stability with degradation temperatures ranging from 294.2 °C to 319.1 °C. Furthermore, RB-CE had a high water/oil binding capacity, with RB-CE90 having WHC and OBC of 9.68 g/g and 7.24 g/g, respectively. The current work serves as a model for the environmentally friendly and convenient extraction of cellulose from biomass, and the cellulose obtained can be employed in the field of food and composite materials.",

Samples were inoculated with a five-serovar cocktail of Salmonella at ca. 4.8 log CFU/g and treated by immersion with a water control (90 s), CP (5% v/v, 30 s), PAA (0.05% v/v or 500 ppm, 90 s), or SA (2% v/v, 30 s), all at 4°C and with mechanical agitation. Samples were vacuum packed and stored for up to 3 days at 4°C. Three independent replications were performed for each product, treatment, and time combination. The average Salmonella reductions in chicken hearts after 3 days were 1.33 ± 0.25, 1.40 ± 0.04, and 1.32 ± 0.12 log CFU/g for PAA, SA, and CP, respectively. For chicken livers, the values were 1.10 ± 0.12, 1.09 ± 0.19, and 0.96 ± 0.27 for PAA, SA, and CP, respectively. All antimicrobials reduced Salmonella counts in both chicken hearts and livers by more than one log, in contrast to the water control. All treatments effectively minimized the growth of APC for up to 3 days of refrigerated storage, and no differences in objective color values (L, a, or b) were observed. The poultry industry may use these antimicrobials as components of a multifaceted approach to mitigate Salmonella in nonconventional chicken parts.",

The results showed that ginseng starch exhibited a B-type crystal structure with a low onset pasting temperature of 44.23 ± 0.80 °C, but high peak viscosity and setback viscosity of 5897.34 ± 53.72 cP and 692.00 ± 32.36 cP, respectively. The granular morphology, crystal and short-range ordered structure of ginseng starches were destroyed after CA-A treatment. The more short-chain starches were produced, resulting in the ginseng starches solubility increased. In addition, autoclaving, citric acid (CA) and CA-A treatment promoted polymerization and recrystallization of starch molecules, increased the proportion of amylopectin B1, and B3 chains, and improved molecular weight and resistant starch (RS) content of ginseng starches. The most significant multi-scale structural change was induced by CA-A treatment, which reduced the relative crystallinity of ginseng starch from 28.26 ± 0.24 % to 2.75 ± 0.08 %, and increased the content of RS to 54.30 ± 0.14 %.

Moreover, geese from the 2.4% and 3.2% CA group had the highest plasma glutathione peroxidase and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). A microbial diversity analysis of the cecum conducted by 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that 3.2% CA supplementation showed a significantly higher abundance of beneficial bacteria (Muribaculaceae, CHKCI001, Erysipelotricha-ceae_UCG_003, and UCG_009) (p < 0.05) and a lower abundance of harmful bacteria (Atopobiaceae, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Alistipes) (p < 0.10).

Therefore, diabetic wounds can be treated from the perspective of scavenging oxidative free radicals and reducing the level of inflammation. Herein, we report a bioactive poly(salicylic acid)-poly(citric acid) (FPSa-PCG) hydrogel for diabetic wound repair. The FPSa-PCG hydrogel shows abilities of antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and regulation of macrophage phenotype. The FPSa-PCG hydrogel showed good biocompatibility, and obtain the abilities of promotion of macrophages migration, reduction of ROS generation, suppression of the M1-type macrophage polarization. FPSa and PCG could synergistically enhance the angiogenesis through upregulating the mRNA expression of HIF1Α, VEGF, and CD31 in endothelial cells and reduce the ROS level of macrophages through upregulating the mRNA expression of Nrf2. The in vivo diabetic wound model confirmed the promoting effect of FPSa-PCG hydrogel on wound closure in diabetes. The further studies found that FPSa-PCG hydrogel could induce the CD31 protein expression in the subcutaneous tissue and inhibit the TNF-a protein expression. This work shows that the simple composition FPSa-PCG hydrogel has a promising therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds.",

The weight loss (WL), respiration rate (RR), total soluble solids (TSS), pH, color (L*, a*, b*, chroma, and hue angle), proximate and mineral contents, phenolic and flavonoid contents, and other biochemical properties of the treated and untreated broccoli samples were evaluated throughout the storage duration. The lowest WL was observed when exposed to 0.5 mM of PUT. 1 mM CA and PUT treatments were affected by RR, depending on storage conditions. The lowest TSS content was observed in broccoli samples treated with 0.5 mM CA among all treatments. The chroma value of the samples was preserved by the 0.5 mM SA treatment. The most abundant element in broccoli samples was potassium in the control application, followed by a 1 mM SA treatment. In addition, the protein content was the highest in the 1 mM PUT treatment. The highest vitamin C was determined in the 1 mM CA treatment, and the most abundant vanillic acid was found in broccoli exposed to the 0.5 mM and treatment. Glucose content was determined at the lowest level in the 0.5 mM SA treatment, while higher increases occurred in other treatments. In terms of these findings, 1 mM CA, 1 mM SA, and 1 mM PUT delay WL, RR, and color degradation and prolong the storage life of broccoli samples stored at 4 ± 0.5°C. It was concluded that the biochemical content, fresh weight, and green color of broccoli samples throughout postharvest and storage can be maintained longer by exogenous application of these natural compounds. Therefore, we recommend 1 mM PUT and 1 mM CA treatments to maintain the quality of broccoli by minimizing losses in morphological properties, mineral, and biochemical compositions during postharvest storage."

The CA loading capacity reached up to 0.7 g CA/g hydrogel-coated stent. The GelMA hydrogel coating has higher mechanical strength and lower swelling performance after loading with CA. The in vitro experiments of stents exhibited good performance in CA sustained release and the calculi can be dissolved in almost 3 days. The stents also showed good blood compatibility and cell compatibility. This research has important clinical value in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic calculi."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Horticultural diseases caused by bacterial pathogens provide an obstacle to crop production globally. Management of the infection of kiwifruit by the Gram-negative phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) currently includes copper and antibiotics. However, the emergence of bacterial resistance and a changing regulatory landscape are providing the impetus to develop environmentally sustainable antimicrobials. One potential strategy is the use of bacteriophage endolysins, which degrade peptidoglycan during normal phage replication, causing cell lysis and the release of new viral progeny. Exogenous use of endolysins as antimicrobials is impaired by the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that provides an impermeable barrier and prevents endolysins from accessing their target peptidoglycan. Here, we describe the synergy between citric acid and a phage endolysin, which results in a reduction of viable Psa below detection. We show that citric acid drives the destabilization of the outer membrane via acidification and sequestration of divalent cations from the lipopolysaccharide, which is followed by the degradation of the peptidoglycan by the endolysin. Scanning electron microscopy revealed clear morphological differences, indicating cell lysis following the endolysin-citric acid treatment. These results show the potential for citric acid-endolysin combinations as a possible antimicrobial approach in agricultural applications. IMPORTANCE: The phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) causes major impacts to kiwifruit horticulture, and the current control strategies are heavily reliant on copper and antibiotics. The environmental impact and increasing resistance to these agrichemicals are driving interest in alternative antimicrobials including bacteriophage-derived therapies. In this study, we characterize the endolysin from the Otagovirus Psa374 which infects Psa. When combined with citric acid, this endolysin displays an impressive antibacterial synergy to reduce viable Psa below the limit of detection. The use of citric acid as a synergistic agent with endolysins has not been extensively studied and has never been evaluated against a plant pathogen. We determined that the synergy involved a combination of the chelation activity of citric acid, acidic pH, and the specific activity of the ΦPsa374 endolysin.

In suspension assays, all the solutions showed significant reductions in bacterial number (log10 reduction: CA 5.77; LAV 4.91; PRT 4.74; MA 1.23). The biofilm assay revealed that PRT and LAV reduced biofilm formation by ~25% after a 15 min treatment, while PRT was most effective after a 24 h treatment (~68%). The number of PA in biofilms measured directly after a 15 min treatment was reduced most effectively with CA and LAV (log10 reductions ~2.5), whereas after a 24 h treatment, all solutions achieved only 1.36-1.65 log10 reductions. In the skin wound model, PRT and LAV provided the highest bacterial reduction after a 15 min treatment (log10 reduction 1.8-1.9), while MA was more effective after a 22 h treatment (log10 reduction 3.6). The results demonstrated the antimicrobial efficacy of all solutions against PA. Further investigation is needed to explore the potential clinical applications of a combination or alternating use of these solutions for infection prophylaxis and treatment of wound infections caused by PA."

In this study, we investigated the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer in mice subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) and observed an increase in citric acid expenditure. Notably, citrate treatment demonstrates significant efficacy in promoting tumor cell apoptosis, suppressing cell proliferation, and inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. Our investigations revealed that citrate achieved these effects by releasing secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) proteins, repolarizing M2 macrophages into M1 macrophages, and facilitating tumor cell apoptosis. Overall, our research highlights the critical role of citric acid as a pivotal metabolite in the intricate relationship between obesity and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we uncovered the significant metabolic and immune checkpoint function of SPARC in pancreatic cancer, suggesting its potential as both a biomarker and therapeutic target in treating this patient population.",

Based on commonly grinding (40, 100 meshes) and superfine grinding okra powders, two extraction solvents (hydrochloric acid, HA; citric acid, CA) were used firstly. Next, the extraction yield, physical and chemical properties, molecular structure and functional properties of OPs were analyzed by non-ultrasonic treatment and ultrasound-assisted superfine grinding method. The outcomes demonstrated that the extraction yield of OPs rose as the particle size of the powder decreased. HA-OPs had higher molecular weight (Mw), apparent viscosity and emulsification ability than CA-OPs. CA-OPs had higher esterification degree (DE), solubility and total sugar content, and higher amounts of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) segments. Compared with OPs without ultrasound-assisted extraction, ultrasound-assisted superfine grinding extraction exhibited higher sugar content, antioxidant capacity, emulsification ability, lower Mw, DE and apparent viscosity. Finally, the correlation between structure and function of OPs was further quantified. The antioxidant capacity was positively correlated with RG-I content, and negatively correlated with DE and Mw. The emulsification ability was mainly positively correlated with the GlcA of OPs. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development of OPs foods with clear structure-function relationship, which would be instructive for the application of OPs in food and cosmetics.",

Thus, studying how phosphate compounds impact metal immobilization in rhizospheric soil using LMWOAs is crucial. An incubation experiment examined the effects of NaH2PO4 (a P compound) (3%), various concentrations of citric acid (CA), and combinations of P and CA, on soil cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) immobilization using the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction method, CaCl2 extraction method, zeta potential, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The P, low CA (2 mmol kg-1 soil) (CA2), and P-CA2 treatments reduced acid-soluble and CaCl2-extractable Cd, Pb, and Zn, indicating metal immobilization, with the P-CA2 treatment being the most effective. High CA (>5-20 mmol kg-1 soil) or a P with high CA reversed prior patterns, suggesting metal mobilization. The zeta potential study indicated that when pH increased, treatments became more negative, notably P-CA2 followed by P, suggesting that electrostatic adsorption was the predominant metal immobilization mechanism, especially in P-CA2. XRD tests, however, showed that the P treatment alone produced Cd phosphate, pyromorphite, and hopeite, indicating that sorption and precipitation were the main metal immobilization processes in the P treatment alone. In conclusion, P-CA2 was found to be the most efficient metal immobilization and redistribution treatment for contaminated soils. Rhizospheric CA may alter Cd, Pb, and Zn mineral stability. Therefore, when treating Cd, Pb, and Zn-contaminated soils with a P compound, CA should be addressed.",

      "abstract": "To determine how to strengthen the Cd-enriched plant Solanum nigrum L. to remediate cadmium(Cd)-contaminated soil, a pot experiment was conducted with five treatments:control treatment(CK), Glomus mosseae(GM), G. mosseae+citric acid(GM+CA), G. mosseae+Bacillus megaterium(GM+BM), and G. mosseae+B. megaterium+citric acid(GM+BM+CA). We measured soil total Cd, available Cd, plant Cd uptake, and microbial community changes and analyzed the effects of exogenous microbial agents and citric acid addition on the remediation effect of Cd contamination by S. nigrum L. The results showed that relative to that of the CK treatment, the root, stem, and leaf biomass of the GM treatment significantly increased by 35.67%, 41.35%, and 65.38%, and the root and stem biomass of the GM+BM+CA treatment significantly increased by 73.38% and 75.38%. The GM+BM+CA treatment significantly increased Cd accumulation in leaves by 226.84%. The GM+BM+CA treatment significantly increased the Cd transport factor from stem to leaves by 52.47%. The GM+BM+CA treatment significantly increased the leaf bioconcentration factor by 120.53%. In addition, the combined restoration also had an impact on the rhizosphere microbial community structure, especially in inducing the relative abundance of some key microbial groups such as Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Glomeromycota, and Olpidiomycota to increase by 2.00%-5.77%, 0.76%-9.96%, 2.11%-3.63%, and 0.54%-2.98%, respectively. According to the RDA analysis, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were negatively correlated with soil total Cd, whereas Glomeromycota and Olpidiomycota were negatively correlated with soil total Cd. The changes in key microorganisms enhanced the ability of S. nigrum L. to absorb rhizosphere nutrients and resist Cd stress, increased the Cd accumulation ability of S. nigrum L., and effectively reduced the total Cd content in soil. In conclusion, G. mosseae, citric acid, and B. megaterium activated insoluble Cd in the soil by co-inoculation, which contributed to more Cd accumulation by S. nigrum L. and also produced co-remediation with G. mosseae. The enrichment plant-microorganism combined remediation Cd-contaminated soil has good application potential.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic substance that is uptake by plants from soils, Cd easily transfers into the food chain. Considering global food security, eco-friendly, cost-effective, and metal detoxification strategies are highly demandable for sustainable food crop production. The purpose of this study was to investigate how citric acid (CA) alleviates or tolerates Cd toxicity in Brassica using a proteome approach. In this study, the global proteome level was significantly altered under Cd toxicity with or without CA supplementation in Brassica. A total of 4947 proteins were identified using the gel-free proteome approach. Out of these, 476 proteins showed differential abundance between the treatment groups, wherein 316 were upregulated and 160 were downregulated. The gene ontology analysis reveals that differentially abundant proteins were involved in different biological processes including energy and carbohydrate metabolism, CO2 assimilation and photosynthesis, signal transduction and protein metabolism, antioxidant defense, heavy metal detoxification, plant development, and cytoskeleton and cell wall structure in Brassica leaves. Interestingly, several candidate proteins such as superoxide dismutase (A0A078GZ68) L-ascorbate peroxidase 3 (A0A078HSG4), glutamine synthetase (A0A078HLB2), glutathione S-transferase DHAR1 (A0A078HPN8), glutamine synthetase (A0A078HLB2), cysteine synthase (A0A078GAD3), S-adenosylmethionine synthase 2 (A0A078JDL6), and thiosulfate/3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase 2 (A0A078H905) were involved in antioxidant defense system and sulfur assimilation-involving Cd-detoxification process in Brassica. These findings provide new proteome insights into CA-mediated Cd-toxicity alleviation in Brassica, which might be useful to oilseed crop breeders for enhancing heavy metal tolerance in Brassica using the breeding program, with sustainable and smart Brassica production in a metal-toxic environment.",

The flame retardant functional coating is composed of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), guar gum (GG), citric acid (CA), and a negligible amount of catalyst. Cotton fabrics were impregnated with different concentrations of ammonium polyphosphate and guar gum, with citric acid as a crosslinking agent. The overall crosslinking and grafting process was proven by FTIR and XPS. Based on the results, the designed coating exhibits over 90 % transmittance in the visible region. A 15 g/m2 flame-retardant coating induces excellent flame retardant efficiency at ultra-low flame-retardant concentrations of less than 6.25 wt%. Only a 5.25 wt% flame retardant concentration demonstrated condensed phase action, which resulted in 58.5 % and 73.6 % reductions in the pHRR and THR, respectively. Moreover, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value showed a 74 % increase. The mechanical performance of FR coated cotton fibers was slightly reduced.",

Unfortunately, there is a very high risk of bacterial infection during corneal transplantation. In this study, we proposed a novel synthetic collagen-based film for corneal therapy, and we effectively incorporated aminoglycoside gentamicin molecules onto the surface of the collagen film. We anticipate that this collagen-based substance will be antimicrobial and repair corneal tissue damage. Three steps were used to create this gentamicin-modified carboxylated collagen film, including: (i) Cross-link the collagen molecules with 1-ethyl-3- (3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and n-hydroxysuccinimide to create a collagen (Col) film. (ii) Citric acid was used to modify the Col film's surface in order to increase the number of carboxyl groups there (ColCA). (iii) Gentamicin molecules were grafted onto the surface of ColCA film by forming amide bonds (ColCA-GM). We discovered that this ColCA-GM film has good physicochemical properties and excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that treating collagen films with citric acid significantly improved the antibacterial properties of ColCA-GM film. The outcomes point to a variety of potential applications for this novel film in corneal tissue engineering.",

The model utilizes literature data on metabolite concentrations and enzyme kinetic constants to calculate the probabilities of individual reactions occurring on a microscopic scale, which can be viewed as the reaction rates on a macroscopic scale. However, it should be noted that the model has some limitations, including not accounting for all the reactions in which the metabolites are involved. Therefore, a genetic algorithm (GA) was used to estimate the impact of these external processes. Despite these limitations, our model achieved high accuracy and stability, providing real-time observation of changes in metabolite concentrations. This type of model can help in better understanding the mechanisms of biochemical reactions in cells, which can ultimately contribute to the prevention and treatment of aging, cancer, metabolic diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders.",

METHODS: The experimental group underwent local anticoagulation with citrate, whereas the control group received systemic anticoagulation with heparin. Relevant data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the inclusion criteria were independently extracted through computer searches of the China Journal Full Text Database (CNKI), Wanfang, and Vipul databases. Additionally, references to included literature were searched to expand the dataset. Extracted RCTs that met inclusion criteria underwent independent quality evaluation and cross-checking using the Cochrane systematic review method. Subsequently, a meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS: The analysis included seven studies involving a total of 652 patients. After treatment, renal function improvement was significantly more significant in the citrate group, while creatinine and urea nitrogen levels showed a more significant decrease in the heparin group, with statistically significant differences (WMD = -51.30, 95% CI = -68.54 ~ -34.06, P = .000 and WMD = 3.68, 95% CI = -4.52 ~ -2.85, P = .000). The filter lifespan in the citrate group was significantly longer than in the heparin group, with a statistically significant difference (WMD = 6.93, 95% CI = 6.30 ~ 7.55, P = .000). Adverse bleeding reactions were significantly less common in the citrate group compared to the heparin group, with a statistically significant difference (RR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.06 ~ 0.32, P = .000). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis indicate that citrate anticoagulation is more effective than heparin anticoagulation in continuous renal replacement therapy for patients with acute kidney injury in sepsis. Citrate anticoagulation contributes to improved renal function and extended filter usage and reduces the incidence of adverse bleeding reactions.",

Microscopy images indicated that ethanol treatment induced the formation of porous structures on the surface; furthermore, treatment with phytic and citric acid induced indentations, pores, and irregular structures in E-PA, E-CA, and E-PACA starches. Phytic and citric acid were retained in the starch molecules through ester bonds with the phosphate and carboxyl groups, respectively. Starch esterification by phytic and citric acid induced a loss of crystallinity, high water absorption capacity, and low solubility. E-PACA starch exhibited more efficient Cu2+ adsorption (38.13 mg/g) than native, E, E-PA, and E-CA starches (0.11, 0.49, 2.05, and 36.23 mg/g, respectively). Thus, modification with ethanol, phytic acid and citric acid can be applied to prepare natural starch-based heavy metal adsorbents.",

In this study, we measured the effects of different concentrations of citric acid-activated chlorine dioxide solution (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg/L of chlorine dioxide) on the morphology (macrostructure and microstructure), chlorophyll a content, chlorophyll b content, carotenoid content, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm, Y (II), NPQ, and ETRmax) of U. prolifera. Micropropagules in the treatment filtrate were cultured to determine whether the solution reduced the number of micropropagules released during the treatment process. The results showed that citric acid-activated chlorine dioxide at the appropriate concentration can be applied to remove U. prolifera from Neopyropia cultivation rafts. Because U. prolifera and its micropropagules died in the 250 mg/L chlorine dioxide group, we recommend that the appropriate concentration of chlorine dioxide for removing green macroalgae is ≥250 mg/L. Our results provide a scientific basis for convenient collection of accurate data for the U. prolifera prevention trial organized by the Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China.",

      "abstract": "Bone targeted delivery of estrogen offers great promise for the clinical application of estrogen in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). However, the current bone-targeted drug delivery system still has several issues that need to be solved, such as the side effects of bone-targeted modifier molecules and the failure of the delivery system to release rapidly in the bone tissue. It is important to aggressively search for new bone-targeted modifier molecules and bone microenvironment-responsive delivery vehicles. Inspired by the distribution of citric acid (CA) mainly in bone tissue and the acidic bone resorption microenvironment, we constructed a CA-modified diblock copolymer poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-poly(ε-caprolactone) (CA-PEOz) drug delivery system. In our study, we found that the CA modification significantly increased the bone targeting of this drug delivery system, and the delivery system was able to achieve rapid drug release under bone acidic conditions. The delivery system significantly reduced bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporotic mice with a significant reduction in estrogenic side effects on the uterus. In summary, our study shows that CA can act as an effective bone targeting modifier molecule and provides a new option for bone targeting modifications. Our study also provides a new approach for bone-targeted delivery of estrogen for the treatment of PMOP."

      "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating chromium stress (Cr-S) tolerance of tomato plants treated with citric acid (CA). Prior to the Cr treatment, tomato plants were foliar-fed with CA (100 μM) daily for 3 days. Subsequently, the plants were grown for another ten days in a hydroponic system in a 50 μM Cr (VI) solution. Chromium treatment reduced photosynthetic pigments and plant biomass, but boosted the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) malondialdehyde (MDA), H2S, phytochelatins (PCs), and glutathione (GSH), electrolyte leakage (EL), and antioxidant enzyme activity in tomato plants. However, the foliar spray of CA mitigated the levels of H2O2, MDA, and EL, promoted plant growth and chlorophyll content, enhanced antioxidant enzymes' activities, and increased H2S production in Cr-S-tomato plants. CA also increased the levels of GSH and PCs, potentially reducing the toxicity of Cr through regulated sequestration. Additionally, the application of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS), a donor of H2S, improved CA-induced Cr stress tolerance. The addition of CA promoted Cr accumulation in root cell wall and leaf vacuoles to suppress its toxicity. To assess the involvement of H2S in CA-mediated Cr-S tolerance, 0.1 mM hypotaurine (HT), an H2S scavenger, was provided to the control and Cr-S-plants along with CA and CA + NaHS. HT reduced the beneficial effects of CA by decreasing H2S production in tomato plants. However, the NaHS addition with CA + HT inverted the adverse impacts of HT, indicating that H2S is required for CA-induced Cr-S tolerance in tomato plants.",

Five types of SSB were used as a carbon source for CA production by A. niger, and the COD of each SSB was measured before and after the bioprocess. Results showed that all tested SSB were suitable for CA production, with maximum yields ranging from 13.01 to 56.62 g L- 1. The COD was reduced from 53 to 75.64%, indicating that the bioprocess effectively treated SSB wastes. The use of SSB as a substrate for CA production provides an alternative to traditional feedstocks, such as sugarcane and beet molasses. The low-cost and high availability of SSB makes it an attractive option for CA production. Moreover, the study demonstrated the potential of the bioprocess to simultaneously treat and reuse SSB wastes, reducing the environmental impact of the beverage industry.

The treatment and reuse of citric acid wastewater with high organic loading become extremely important. In this study, the performance of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) precipitation as a low-cost and environmentally friendly pre-treatment method and aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR) combined treatment system was investigated for the treatment of citric acid (CA) wastewater. At the first step, optimization parameters such as agitation speed (100, 150, 200 rpm), temperature (30, 50, 70 °C), and reaction time (2, 4, 6 h) for Ca(OH)2 precipitation as a pre-treatment method were investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) to achieve maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. Experimental sets were designed using Box-Behnken Design. As a result of pre-treatment with Ca(OH)2 precipitation, a COD removal efficiency of 97.3% was obtained. Then, pre-treated CA wastewater was fed continuously to the MBR process for 10 days, which was the second stage of the combined process. As a result of the MBR process, 92.0% COD removal efficiency was obtained for 24 h HRT and 10 days SRT. In total, 99.8% COD removal efficiency was obtained when combined process was used and COD concentration decreased from 52,000-114 mg/L.

In the present study, hog plum bagasse (HPB) treated with citric acid alone (0.12 dm3, 99.0% purity) and in synergistic treatment with ultrasound (40 KHz, 400 W, 0.348 W/cm3, 60 min, 80 °C). Treated samples were evaluated for proximate and lignocellulose composition, functional, bioactive, structural, morphology and microbial properties, while the untreated samples served as control. HPB showed varied proximate values with treatment effect. Notably, a significant reduction (42.06%) was observed in fibre content. A similar reduction was observed in the hemicellulose and lignin fraction but improved the yield of the cellulose component. Furthermore, treatment increased bulk density (0.120-0.131 g/cm3), water absorption capacity (5.60-6.35 g/g), swelling power (8.85-9.94 g/g) and solubility index (1.01-2.32%) but reduced oil absorption capacity (7.50-4.15 g/g). All colour parameters were reduced with treatment, while the total phenolic compound and antioxidant capacity of treated bagasse improved by 24.70% and 45.37%. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy alterations were observed in the absorption spectra with treatment, while scanning electron microscopestructure in treated samples showed cavity formation. Also, the microbial population was reduced to a non-detectable level after treatment. Ultrasound-assisted treatment of HPB holds a valorisation potential for its food application by relevant agro-based industries.",

The protective effect of emulsion gels induced in different ways on lutein was investigated, and the stability of lutein in emulsion gels and processed cheese was analyzed. The results showed that the acidification rate of CA was higher than that of GDL, which was the key step in acid-induced gels, and that the difference in acidification rate led to differences in gel structure. Compared with the 2 acid inducers (GDL and CA), TG exhibited greater potential for forming gel structures with high strength. The TG-induced emulsion gels showed the best physical stability and the highest embedding efficiency for lutein. After heat treatment (85°C), the GDL-induced emulsion gels had higher retention rate of lutein and showed good thermal stability compared with the CA-induced emulsion gels. The processed cheese added with the TG-induced emulsion gel had higher hardness and springiness compared with the processed cheese added with the other 2 kinds of emulsion gels, whereas the processed cheese added with the CA-induced emulsion gel had a lower density of network structure, showing porosity and a larger aggregated structure, but the highest bioavailability of lutein. These results provide valuable information for the formation of cold-set emulsion gel and provide the possibility for the application of emulsion gel embedding active substances in processed cheese.",

Thin films were prepared from the aqueous suspension of CNCs by casting and evaporation with 15% glycerol as a plasticizer. Our research aimed to create stable films resistant to water. The structure and the interactions of the films were modified by short (10 min) heating at different temperatures (100, 140, and 160 °C) and by adding different amounts of citric acid (0, 10, 20, and 30%). Various analytical methods were used to determine the structure, surface properties, and mechanical properties. The interaction of composite films with water and water vapor was also investigated. Heat treatment did not significantly affect the film properties. Citric acid, without heat treatment, acted as a plasticizer. It promoted the disintegration of films in water, increased water vapor sorption, and reduced tensile strength, resulting in flexible and easy-to-handle films. The combination of heat treatment and citric acid resulted in stable liquid-water-resistant films with excellent mechanical properties. A minimum heating temperature of 120 °C and a citric acid concentration of 20% were required to obtain a stable CNC film structure resistant to liquid water."

Adipose-derived mesenchymal cells (ADSCs) have already been tested in clinical trials for their regenerative and immunomodulatory potential in various medical fields; however, the advancement to bedside treatment has proven to be tedious. Innovative solutions are expected to circumvent regulatory and manufacturing issues related to living cell-based therapies. The objectives of the study were to test if human primary ADSCs preconditioned with magnetic nanoparticles coated with citric acid and functionalized with antioxidant protocatechuic acid (MNP-CA-PCA) retain their phenotypic features and if conditioned media elicit immune responses in vitro. MNP-CA-PCA was synthesized and characterized regarding size, colloidal stability as well as antioxidant release profile. Human primary ADSCs preconditioned with MNP-CA-PCA were tested for viability, surface marker expression and mesenchymal lineage differentiation potential. Conditioned media (CM) from ADSCs treated with MNP-CA-PCA were tested for Il-6 and IL-8 cytokine release using ELISA and inhibition of lectin-stimulated peripheral blood monocyte proliferation. Results: MNP-CA-PCA-preconditioned ADSCs display good viability and retain their specific mesenchymal stem cell phenotype. CM from ADSCs conditioned with MNP-CA-PCA do not display increased inflammatory cytokine release and do not induce proliferation of allergen-stimulated allogeneic peripheral blood monocytes in vitro. Conclusions: While further in vitro and in vivo tests are needed to validate these findings, the present results indicated that CM from ADSCs preconditioned with MNP-CA-PCA could be developed as possible cell-free therapies for rescuing auditory hair cells.",

      "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential nutrient in most organisms. Establishing an effective regulatory system of Mn absorption is important for sustainable crop development. In this study, we selected sunflower as the model plant to explore the effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or salicylic acid (SA) combined with citric acid (CA) on Mn absorption. Six-leaf-old sunflower plants were exposed to 0.8 g kg-1 Mn for one week and then treated with chelating agents, i.e., CA (10 mmol kg-1), and different concentrations of ALA and SA for one week. The results showed that Mn-treated plants had significantly increased H2O2, O2- and MDA contents in leaves compared with the control. Under the Mn + CA treatment, ALA or SA2 significantly activated the antioxidant defense system by increasing SOD, POD and CAT activities in leaves. Moreover, the application of CA significantly increased the Mn uptake in sunflower roots compared with Mn treatment alone; however, did not accelerate the translocation efficiency of Mn from sunflower roots to shoots. Moreover, ultrastructural and RT-qPCR results further demonstrated that ALA/SA could recover the adverse impact of excessive Mn accumulation in sunflowers. Like a pump, ALA/SA regulated the translocation efficiency and promoted the transportation of Mn from roots to shoots. This study provides insights into the promotive role of ALA/SA combined with CA on sunflower growth by regulating Mn absorption, which would be beneficial for regulating Mn absorption in soil with an Mn deficit."

      "abstract": "Membrane fouling during the filtration process is a perennial issue and could lead to reduced separation efficiency. In this work, poly(citric acid)-grafted graphene oxide (PGO) was incorporated into a matrix of single-layer hollow fibre (SLHF) and dual-layer hollow fibrr (DLHF) membranes, respectively, aiming to improve membrane antifouling properties during water treatment. Different loadings of PGO ranging from 0 to 1 wt% were first introduced into the SLHF to identify the best PGO loading for the DLHF preparation with its outer layer modified by nanomaterials. The findings showed that at the optimized PGO loading of 0.7 wt%, the resultant SLHF membrane could achieve higher water permeability and bovine serum albumin rejection compared to the neat SLHF membrane. This is due to the improved surface hydrophilicity and increased structural porosity upon incorporation of optimized PGO loading. When 0.7 wt% PGO was introduced only to the outer layer of DLHF, the cross-sectional matrix of the membrane was altered, forming microvoids and spongy-like structures (more porous). Nevertheless, the BSA rejection of the membrane was improved to 97.7% owing to an inner selectivity layer produced from a different dope solution (without the PGO). The DLHF membrane also demonstrated significantly higher antifouling properties than the neat SLHF membrane. Its flux recovery rate is 85%, i.e. 37% better than that of a neat membrane. By incorporating hydrophilic PGO into the membrane, the interaction of the hydrophobic foulants with the membrane surface is greatly reduced.",

Hydrogel films were prepared by solvent casting technique. The films were evaluated for total carboxyl content (TCC), tensile strength, protein adsorption, permeability properties, hemocompatibility, swellability, moxifloxacin (MFX) loading and release, in-vivo wound healing activity and characterized using instrumental techniques. An optimal increase in amount of PVA and CA increased the TCC and tensile strength of the hydrogel films. Hydrogel films exhibited low protein adsorption and microbial permeation, good permeability to water vapour and oxygen, and sufficient hemocompatibility. The films prepared using high concentration of PVA and low concentration of CA showed good swellability in phosphate buffer and simulated wound fluids. MFX loading in the hydrogel films was found in the range of 384-440 mg/g. The hydrogel films sustained the release of MFX up to 24 h. The release followed Non-Fickian mechanism. ATR-FTIR, solid state 13C NMR and TGA analysis indicated formation of ester crosslinks. In-vivo study revealed good wound healing activity for hydrogel films. From the overall study, it can be concluded that the citric acid crosslinked CMTG-PVA hydrogel films can be effectively used for wound treatment.",

Degradation of ERα with the normal plasma oestrogen levels induced by fulvestrant, significantly augments the cough response of female but not male guinea pigs. These changes were observed in citric acid-induced cough. Female guinea pigs responded with an increased count of cough expulsions per challenge time and we also detected shorter cough latency. The capsaicin-induced cough did not change. A similar response was observed after danazol treatment, which decreased the plasma oestrogen level. Our results indicate that the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channel-mediated cough is resistant to the hypoestrous state, while the citric acid-mediated cough is oestrogen-dependent and hypersensitive during the hypoestrous state.",

      "abstract": "Humic acids were known to inhibit sewage sludge anaerobic digestion (AD) and many studies have been investigated to deal with the inhibitory effect of humic acids (HA) in raw sludge feeding the digestor. However, HA could also be in-situ produced during the sludge AD process with a significant amount, but the relieving of the inhibitory effect posed by the in-situ produced HA has been historically ignored. Thus, this study attempted to use citric acid (CA), an easily biodegradable polyatomic acid, to directly treat sludge in the anaerobic digestor instead of the feeding sludge, for alleviating inhibition caused by the in-situ produced HA. Results showed that methane production of AD batches with CA pretreatment at 0.06∼0.10 g/g TS on digestor sludge were effectively enhanced, with the highest production being 2.89 times of that observed in control AD without CA treatment and 2.08 times of that achieved by contrast AD with CA pretreatment on raw sludge. However, the AD batches with CA treatment at low dosages of 0.02∼0.04 g/g TS had lower methane production, during which sludge solubilization and hydrolysis were enhanced initially associated with released HA surfactant and hydrolytic enzymes; then later inhibited since higher structurally sound HA in SP easily rebind proteinaceous substrates and enzymes again. Whilst CA treatment at 0.06∼0.10 g/g TS could promote sludge solubilization and hydrolysis throughout the sludge AD process. This dosage-dependent effect of CA treatment can be caused by its discriminating impact on HA structure and distribution. At low dosages, complexes of HA-proteins (including hydrolases) can be decrosslinked and transferred to the soluble phase (SP), thus enhancing solubilization and hydrolysis initially. However, the released HA in SP could rebind more organics and hydrolases during AD, resulting in augmented inhibition. While the dosage increased, HA were drastically deconstructed with aromatic cores in SP migrating to extracellular polymeric substances, preventing binding effects on organics and hydrolases. Accordingly, a smart mutex-switch operational strategy of CA treatment was proposed. The results suggested, to alleviate the inhibitory effect of HA on sludge AD, more attention should be given to HA produced and accumulated in AD rather than raw sludge so that the CA treatment directly on sludge in the digestor can be a promising method.",

The use of amphiphilic polymers that possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic chain segments can be advantageous for the hydrophilic modification of UF membranes due to their excellent combination in the membrane matrix. In the present study, we examined a novel amphiphilic CA-g-AN material, constructed by grafting citric acid (CA) to aniline (AN), as a modified material to improve the hydrophilicity of a PES membrane. This material was more compatible with the polymer membrane matrix than a pure hydrophilic modified material. The polyethersulfone (PES) membranes modified by amphiphilic CA-g-AN demonstrated a higher water flux (290.13 L·m-2·h-1), which was more than eight times higher than that of the pure PES membrane. Furthermore, the flux recovery ratio (FRR) of the modified membrane could reach 83.24% and the value of the water contact angle (WCA) was 76.43°, demonstrating the enhanced hydrophilicity and antifouling ability of the modified membranes.

Each year, the disease is responsible for billions of dollars of losses worldwide. The development of new phytomedicines as alternatives to antibiotics is becoming a new hotspot for treating such diseases. Citric acid (CA) and magnolol (MA) have been shown to have antibacterial, antioxidant, and growth-promoting properties. Here, the bacteriostatic effects of combinations of CA and MA against C. perfringens were investigated, together with their effects on yellow-hair chickens challenged with C. perfringens. It was found that the optimal CA:MA ratio was 50:3, with a dose of 265 μg/mL significantly inhibiting C. perfringens growth, and 530 μg/mL causing significant damage to the bacterial cell morphology. In animal experiments, C. perfringens challenge reduced the growth, damaged the intestinal structure, activated inflammatory signaling, impaired antioxidant capacity, and perturbed the intestinal flora. These effects were alleviated by combined CA-MA treatment. The CA-MA combination was found to inhibit the TLR/Myd88/NF-κB and Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathways. In conclusion, the results suggest the potential of combined CA-MA treatment in alleviating C. perfringens challenge by inhibiting the growth of C. perfringens and affecting the TLR/MyD88/NF-κB and Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathways."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Plasma citric acid cycle (CAC) metabolites might be likely related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, studies assessing the longitudinal associations between circulating CAC-related metabolites and CVD risk are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of baseline and 1-year levels of plasma CAC-related metabolites with CVD incidence (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death), and their interaction with Mediterranean diet interventions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Case-cohort study from the PREDIMED trial involving participants aged 55-80 years at high cardiovascular risk, allocated to MedDiets or control diet. A subcohort of 791 participants was selected at baseline, and a total of 231 cases were identified after a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Nine plasma CAC-related metabolites (pyruvate, lactate, citrate, aconitate, isocitrate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, fumarate, malate and succinate) were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Weighted Cox multiple regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). Baseline fasting plasma levels of 3 metabolites were associated with higher CVD risk, with HRs (for each standard deviation, 1-SD) of 1.46 (95%CI:1.20-1.78) for 2-hydroxyglutarate, 1.33 (95%CI:1.12-1.58) for fumarate and 1.47 (95%CI:1.21-1.78) for malate (p of linear trend <0.001 for all). A higher risk of CVD was also found for a 1-SD increment of a combined score of these 3 metabolites (HR = 1.60; 95%CI: 1.32-1.94, p trend <0.001). This result was replicated using plasma measurements after one-year. No interactions were detected with the nutritional intervention. CONCLUSION: Plasma 2-hydroxyglutarate, fumarate and malate levels were prospectively associated with increased cardiovascular risk. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: ISRCTN35739639.",

      "abstract": "Pyrite has been used in photo-Fenton reactions for the degradation of pollutants, but the application of photo-Fenton processes with extra H2O2 in real water/wastewater treatment has still been limited by the economic cost of H2O2 and artificial light sources. Herein, citric acid (CA) and simulated/natural sunlight are used to develop a pyrite-based photo-Fenton system (pyrite-CA-light) in situ generating H2O2 through the enhanced activation of molecular oxygen. The degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), especially acetaminophen (APAP) as the main target pollutant, in the pyrite-CA-light system was investigated. The effects of influencing factors such as various organic acids, APAP concentration, pH, pyrite dosage, CA concentration and co-existing anions (HCO3-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42- and H2PO4-) were examined. At a pyrite dosage of 0.1 g L-1, CA concentration of 0.6 mM and an initial pH of 6.0, the degradation efficiency of APAP (30 μM) was 99.1% within 30 min under the irradiation of xenon lamp (70 W, λ ≥ 350 nm). Almost the same high efficiency of APAP degradation (93.9%) in the system was achieved under natural sunlight irradiation (ca. 650 W m-2). The scavenging experiments revealed that the dominant active species for degrading APAP was hydroxyl radical (HO•). Moreover, a quantitative structural-activity relationship (QSAR) model for pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) was established with a high significance (R2 = 0.932, p = 0.001) by using three descriptors: octanol-water partition coefficient (logKow), dissociation constant (pKa) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). This work provides an innovative strategy of the photo-Fenton process for the degradation of PPCPs using natural minerals and ordinary carboxylic acid under sunlight."

Before coating, the nanoparticles were processed by electrohydraulic discharges with a high discharge current (several tens of amperes) in a water medium using a pulsed direct current. Magnetite nanoparticles were obtained with an average crystallite diameter D = 25-28 nm as obtained by XRD and particle sizes of 25 nm as measured by small-angle X-ray scattering. Magnetometry showed that all samples were superparamagnetic. The saturation magnetization for the citric acid covered samples after electrohydraulic processing showed higher value (58 emu/g) than for the directly coated samples (50 emu/g). Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the presence and binding of citric acid to the magnetite surface by chemisorption of carboxylate ions. Hydrodynamic sizes obtained from DLS and zeta potentials were 93 and 115 nm, -26 and -32 mV for the citric acid covered nanoparticles and 226 nm and 21 mV for the bare nanoparticles, respectively. The hydraulic discharge treatment resulted in a higher citric acid coverage and better particle dispersion. The developed method can be used in nanoparticle synthesis for biomedical applications."

      "abstract": "Phellinus igniarius is a valuable medicinal fungus. P. igniarius is rich in a variety of chemical compounds with medicinal value, among which are flavonoids. Therefore, increasing the content of flavonoids in P. igniarius is beneficial for its potential use in medicinal applications. This study demonstrated that exogenous treatment with citric acid (CA) could significantly increase flavonoid accumulation in P. igniarius. Additionally, we found that CA induced the biosynthesis of flavonoids in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The flavonoid content could be increased up to 60.96 mg/g when using the treatment with 2.77 mM citric acid for 69.74 h, which was determined by using the response surface method. The changes in the fingerprint profiles of P. igniarius flavonoids with the treatment of CA as an exogenous inducer were also analyzed. In this study, the effect of citric acid as the exogenous inducer on the flavonoid content of P. igniarius was studied, and the processing conditions were optimized through the surface response curve. This approach provides novel insights and a theoretical basis for the production of high-quality P. igniarius."

In the present study, Tagetes erecta L. plants were used to assess their potential to uptake HMs from wastewater. Plants were grown in soil for 20 days and then transplanted in hydroponic system containing Hoagland nutrient solution. After more than 15 days of growth, plants were then subjected to wastewater from tannery and surgical industries in different concentrations ranging from 25 to 100% in combination of citric acid (5 and 10 mM). After 6 weeks of treatment, plants were collected and segmented into roots, stem, and leaves for characterizing the morphological properties including plant height, roots length, fresh and dry mass of roots, stem, and leaves. For evaluation of the effect of wastewater on the plants, photosynthetic pigments; soluble proteins; reactive oxygen species (ROS); antioxidant enzymes SOD, POD, CAT, and APX; and metal accumulation were analyzed. Application of industrial wastewater revealed a significant effect on plant morphology under wastewater treatments. Overall growth and physiological attributes of plant decreased, and metal accumulation enhanced with increasing concentration of wastewater. Similarly, the production of ROS and antioxidant enzymes were also increased. Chlorophyll, protein content, and enzyme production enhanced with CA (5 and 10 mM) mediation; however, ROS production and EL were reduced. Metals analysis showed that the maximum accumulation of Pb was in roots, while Cr and Ni in the stem which further increased under CA mediation. Overall, the metal accumulation ability was in the order of Pb > Ni > Cr under CA.",

The results indicated that increasing the temperature and time promoted esterification, yielding 0.19 to 0.35 mmol/g of the carboxyl group in CNFs. However, increasing the temperature and time resulted in decreases in yields and the diameter of CNFs from 84.5 to 66.6% and 12 to 4 nm, respectively. Analysis of the anti-bacterial activities of CNFs suggested that the high carboxyl group content corresponded to the effective inhibition of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus Taking yield, size, carboxyl group content, and anti-bacterial activate into consideration, treatment at 120 °C for 24 h was the optimal condition, yielding 76.0% CNF with 0.31 mmol/g carboxyl groups with a diameter of 8 nm and the inhibition fof E. coli (81.7%) and S. aureus (63.1%). In addition, effect of different CNFs on characteristics of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films were investigated. The results indicated that CNF obtained from the optimal condition was a favorable additive for the composite film, which enhanced (74%) the tensile strength of composite film compared with the pure PVA film due to its considerable size and carboxyl group content. However, the composite films did not show an anti-bacterial activate as CNF."

Vancobb-400 strain day old broiler chicks were divided into four main treatment groups T0, T1, T2, and T3. Treatment groups were further divided into eight replicates with ten chicks in each. T0 served as control, given standard corn-soy flakes-based ration (Pre-starter %: Crude protein (CP)-23, Ca-1.00, TP-0.70; Starter %: CP-22, Ca-1.10, TP-0.72, and Finisher %: CP-20, Ca-0.99, TP-0.70). Treatment T1 served as positive control with added 0.5% CA (Pre-starter %: CP-23, Ca-1.00, TP-0.70; Starter %: CP-22, Ca-1.10, TP-0.72 and Finisher %: CP-20, Ca-0.99, TP-0.70). Treatment T2 was given feed containing 0.5% CA with low Ca and TP content (Pre-starter %: CP-23, Ca-0.90, TP-0.66; Starter %: CP-22, Ca-0.99, TP-0.71 and Finisher %: CP-20, Ca-0.90, TP-0.69), whereas treatment T3 was given feed containing 0.5% CA with moderately low Ca and TP content (Pre-starter %: CP-23, Ca-0.80, TP-0.65; Starter %: CP-22, Ca-0.88, TP-0.70 and Finisher %: CP-20, Ca-0.79, TP-0.68). Birds offered moderately low Ca and TP with 0.5% CA addition, exhibited higher growth rate (P < 0.05), better nutrient utilization with positive influence on dressing percentage and forequarters weight. Economics of broiler feeding revealed that 0.5% CA supplementation fetched highest gross return above feed cost in broiler birds offered feed with moderately low Ca and TP content whereas lowest profit was recorded in feed with low content of Ca and TP. In conclusion, supplementation of 0.5% CA in feed with low and moderately low Ca and TP content positively influenced overall growth, and carcass characteristics. Economics of broiler feeding with moderately low Ca and TP content revealed highest profit with CA (0.5%) supplementation.",

Lenthionine has high commercial value, and if we explore the possible induction mechanism of citric acid in lenthionine synthesis, we can provide a reference for the effective application of citric acid as an inducer. In this paper, the single-factor treatment of Lentinula edodes with variable citric acid concentration and treatment duration showed that the best citric acid concentration for L. edodes was 300 μM, and the best treatment duration was 15 days. Additionally, the optimal design conditions were obtained using the response surface method (RSM); the treatment concentration was 406 μM/L, the treatment duration was 15.6 days, and the lenthionine content was 130 μg/g. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (LEGGT) and cystine sulfoxide lyase (LECSL) are the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lanthionine. The expression levels of LEGGT and LECSL genes increased significantly under citric acid treatment. Additionally, the lenthionine content of the silenced strains of LEGGT and LECSL was significantly decreased."

However, the decalcifying solutions have a negative impact on dentin microhardness, which might affect the result of endodontic therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of 17% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), a novel silver-citrate root canal irrigation solution (BioAkt), 10% citric acid, and 40% citric acid on the microhardness of root canal dentin. Materials and methods Forty-five single-root teeth were distributed equally into five groups A, B, C, D, and E treated with distilled water as a control, 17% EDTA, BioAkt, 10% citric acid, and 40% citric acid, respectively. The dentin microhardness was measured before and after the experiment, and the collected data were analyzed using paired sample T-test, One-way ANOVA test, and least significant difference (LSD) test (multiple comparisons), (P < 0.05). Result The results showed that the averages of dentin microhardness values before the experiment were 62.83 kg/mm², 65.34 kg/mm², 64.79 kg/mm², 62.95 kg/mm², and 56.47 kg/mm² for groups A, B, C, D, and E, respectively, while the averages after the experiment were 62.60 kg/mm², 54.92 kg/mm², 54.50 kg/mm², 51.31 kg/mm², and 49.37kg/mm² accordingly. Statistical analysis revealed that 17% EDTA, BioAkt, 10% citric acid, and 40% citric acid decreased the dentin microhardness significantly comparing with the negative control group, without statistical differences among them. Conclusion The chelating agents 17% EDTA, BioAkt, 10% citric acid, and 40% citric acid declined the microhardness of root canal dentin similarly, which might have possible effects on endodontic treatment and the properties of root canal filling materials as well."

Dual treatment with PA and CA induced structural and physicochemical changes in normal corn starch. Phosphorus concentration, degree of substitution, FTIR, and 31P NMR analyses confirmed esterification of starch by dry heating with PA and CA. Both phosphorylation and citration by esterification with PA and CA were observed in PA + 5CA starch, but high CA concentration inhibited covalent interaction between PA and starch in PA + 10CA starch. The degree of phosphorylation and citration resulted in different physicochemical properties in starch treated with PA and CA. The treatment with only PA did not change the crystalline regions of PA starch, but CA treatment induced the disruption of the crystalline structure of PA + 5CA and PA + 10CA starch. PA starch showed high solubility (46.41 %) and transmittance (90.51 %), but dual treatment of PA and CA induced significant decrease in solubility (3.23 %) and transmittance (2.18 %) of PA + 10CA starch. CA treatment increased the fraction of resistant starch in non-cooked (72.44 %) and cooked PA + 10CA starch (42.76 %). Therefore, dual treatment with PA and CA had potential to control physicochemical and functional properties of starch by phosphorylation and citration of starch.",
