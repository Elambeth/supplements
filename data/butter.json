      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effectiveness of 2450 MHz and 915 MHz microwave treatments for inactivating foodborne pathogens during large-scale peanut butter processing (400 g batches). Peanut butter samples inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium were exposed to either 2450 MHz or 915 MHz microwave heating. After treatment, the acid and peroxide values and color changes were assessed to determine the impact of the process. RESULTS: As treatment time increased, pathogen populations showed a corresponding decrease. The 915 MHz microwave treatment for 90 s achieved a reduction of 3.73 to 4.95 log CFU g-1. The 2450 MHz treatment for 160 s resulted in a smaller reduction, ranging from 1.59 to 3.24 log CFU g-1. The 915 MHz microwave treatment did not impact the acid, peroxide, or color values of the peanut butter. In contrast, the 2450 MHz treatment led to higher acid and peroxide values and caused noticeable changes in the color of the peanut butter. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that 915 MHz microwave processing could be an effective method for the food industry to use in peanut butter pasteurization as it achieves pathogen reduction without compromising product quality. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: A vegan diet is associated with health benefits but may also lead to inadequate intake of essential nutrients. Due to the lower selenium content in plant-based compared to animal-based foods, many vegans do not reach the recommended selenium intake in Europe. The only plant-based food with high selenium content is the Brazil nut, even though there is also a high variability. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of Brazil nut butter compared to a dietary supplement as selenium source to improve the selenium status of vegans and omnivores. METHODS: 44 vegans and 42 omnivores were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups, either receiving placebo or consuming additional 55 µg of selenium daily as Brazil nut butter or supplement for two weeks. Serum selenium concentrations, glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), and selenoprotein P (SELENOP) were measured at baseline and after intervention. Additionally, dietary selenium intake was estimated using a five-day dietary protocol. RESULTS: The estimated selenium intake was significantly lower in vegans compared to omnivores and correlated with all three selenium biomarkers. Independent of the dietary pattern (vegan or omnivore), Brazil nut butter as well as supplement significantly increased serum selenium and SELENOP concentrations, while there were no changes in the placebo groups. Both interventions were equally effective in increasing selenium levels, but the upregulation of SELENOP was more pronounced in vegans than in omnivores. CONCLUSION: Brazil nuts are a plant-based source of selenium suitable for vegans and omnivores to improve their selenium status when consumed once in a while.

Bacuri butter is gaining attention for its potential in wound healing and its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. Natural polymers such as onion (Allium cepa) bioplastics have been investigated for their potential as occlusive dressings and for tissue regeneration. Methods: This study evaluated the healing process of experimentally induced skin wounds on horses treated with bacuri butter, washed onion film, and unwashed onion film. Clinical and histopathological analyses of the wounds were conducted in six clinically healthy horses over 28 days, with a control group receiving Ringer's lactate solution. The onion films were produced and characterized for their chemical structure and properties, while the bacuri butter was sourced and prepared for application. Results: All treatments, including the control group, promoted wound healing without relevant differences in wound contraction rates, gross aspect, or histopathological parameters. Conclusions: Therefore, despite minor variations observed in the clinical evaluations between the treatment groups, the bacuri butter or onion biopolymer showed no significant healing effect on skin wounds in horses. Additionally, this study showed the potential of equine models in testing novel therapeutic approaches for wound healing, benefiting both veterinary and human medicine."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Moisturizers are integral to daily skincare routines, reflecting the increasing trend among people towards cosmetic products, particularly for skin care. They significantly contribute to preserving skin health, particularly by regulating the epidermal barrier and moisture levels within the skin. This study aims to explore the moisturizing and antioxidant effect of skin barrier restoring cream Moiz MM (MZ) with shea butter, silkflo and vitamin E by investigating its protective effect against oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and therapeutic mechanisms in human keratinocytes cells (HaCaT). METHODS: The in vitro antioxidant activity of MZ was evaluated by DPPH, ABTS and NO assays. For the cell culture study, HaCaT cells were cultured and stimulated using H2O2 and then treated with different concentrations of MZ. Then, it was subjected to DCFH-DA staining, reverse transcriptase PCR and western blot analysis for the evaluation of various skin-moisture-related components in human keratinocyte cells. Type I procollagen was examined using ELISA technique. RESULTS: The results highlighted that oxidative stress in HaCaT cells decreased type I procollagen synthesis, while MZ treatment significantly increased the synthesis. Moreover, the viability of HaCaT cells was not affected in the presence of MZ, which demonstrates its non-toxic effect. Furthermore, MZ can counteract H2O2-mediated oxidative stress by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activity such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, and decrease reactive oxygen species generation in skin cells. Additionally, MZ greatly promotes hyaluronic acid production by enhancing the expression of the hyaluronic acid synthase-1 gene and Aquaporin 3 protein. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MZ has the potential to serve as a moisturizing and antioxidant skincare formula.",

      "abstract": "Saxidomus purpurata extract (SPE) is a highly consumable seafood worldwide with known health-related benefits. However, there are no reports of its' anti-obesity effect. This study explores the potential of SPE for anti-obesity effects by modulating adipogenesis and lipolysis. SPE reduced intracellular lipid and triglyceride accumulation while increasing free glycerol release in adipocytes. SPE inhibited lipogenesis protein expressions and increased the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to promote lipolysis. In addition, SPE suppressed adipogenesis by downregulating protein expression of key adipogenic markers, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) via Wnt/β-catenin signaling. SPE augmented the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. Thus, pharmacological intervention with Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP-HO-1 antagonist) was employed to validate the HO-1 role. The presence of ZnPP increased the lipid accumulation and reduced the free glycerol release. At the molecular level, adipogenic transcription factors (PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP1) expressions were restored in the presence of ZnPP. GC-MS analysis revealed that SPE was comprised of several fatty acids, contributing to its anti-obesity activity. SPE is an effective nutraceutical that can be used to reduce the progression of obesity. HO-1 expression during adipogenesis might be the mechanism of action for the anti-obesity effect of SPE.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ageing is associated with physical and cognitive declines, which may be further exacerbated by poor nutrition. Nuts are energy and nutrient dense, and their consumption is associated with better physical and cognitive functions in older adults, but data from interventional studies are limited. This 6-month randomised controlled trial is designed to investigate the effects of consuming 43 g/day of peanut butter (equivalent to 1.5 servings of nuts) on physical function, including walking speed (primary outcome), standing and dynamic balance, upper and lower body strength, lower body power and endurance, and associated factors including muscle mass, cognitive function and DNA telomere length in community-dwelling older adults. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A total of 120 participants aged ≥65 years will be recruited and randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to either the intervention group (n=60) that will receive individually packaged sealed containers containing 43 g of peanut butter to be consumed once daily for 6 months alongside habitual diet, or the control group (n=60) that will maintain their habitual diet. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 6 months. The primary outcome is walking speed assessed using the 4 m usual gait speed test. Secondary outcomes include other physical function assessments: standing balance, chair stand time, timed-up-and-go test and four-square step test; and hand grip and knee extensor muscle strength; cognitive function assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and trail making tests; body composition; nutritional status; and DNA telomere length from participants' buccal cell samples. Linear mixed models will be used to compare changes in outcomes between intervention and control groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol is approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12622001291774. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and media. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ANZCTR12622001291774.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials in dairy production can increase the variety of dairy-based products. In this study, the antioxidant and antimicrobial changes in lactic butter samples made from heat-treated creams and enriched with M. communis essential oils (EOs) were investigated. RESULTS: The best lactic butter properties were achieved by optimizing the process at 70 and 80 °C. M. communis EOs decreased lipid oxidation and spoilage microorganism growth in lactic butter during cold storage. M. communis EOs have antioxidant and antimicrobial activity in lactic butter equal to that of ascorbyl palmitate. α-Pinene, p-cymene, limonene, 3-carene, 1,8-cineol, β-linalool, α-terpineol and myretenol are the major contributors to the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of M. communis EOs. They exhibit antioxidant activity by neutralizing free radicals by donating hydrogen or acting as termination enhancers, and antimicrobial activity by disruption of cell membranes, which may result in the leakage of macromolecules or the loss of essential metabolites, ultimately leading to cell death during the storage of lactic butter samples. CONCLUSION: The addition of M. communis EOs improves lactic butter stability equal to that of ascorbyl palmitate, and may be applied as a natural and effective preservative to maintain butter from lipid oxidation and microbial spoilage and enhance its safety. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The growing recognition of the health benefits of natural antioxidants, as opposed to synthetic ones, has led to the development of new applications for natural antioxidants. In this regard, M. communis L. EOs can be used to enhance the shelf stability of cold-stored lactic butter. © 2024 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Background and objective Butter coffee drinks, mainly a form of a saturated fat diet, are widely accepted as a \"healthy energy-boosting drink\", especially in the young and healthy military population. The objective of our study was to determine the effects of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil and butter on lipid profile, especially apolipoprotein B (ApoB), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL-C), and other risk factors for coronary heart disease, such as BMI, BP, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in healthy adults. Materials and methods We conducted a prospective study of 60 subjects who were randomized to one of the two following regimens: (1) coffee or (2) coffee with butter plus MCT oil combination. The primary outcome was the effect on ApoB. Secondary outcomes were as follows: non-HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, BP, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c. These parameters were evaluated at the baseline and after 12 weeks. The Mann-Whitney U test was utilized for analysis of the results. Results While 60 subjects were recruited for the study, only 41 completed it, meeting the minimum required sample size (17 per group) necessary to achieve the desired effect size: 21 males (nine in the control group and 12 in the experimental group) and 20 females (10 in each group). Anthropometric measures were similar between the two groups at baseline, and so were age and BMI (average age: 33.00 ± 5.84 years among controls and 30.86 ± 6.14 years in the experimental group; BMI: 27.35 ± 4.63 kg/m2 vs. 25.74 ± 2.70 kg/m2). The pulse rate was 69.35 ± 10.98 in the control vs. 70.68 ± 10.32 bpm in the experimental group. The waist size was also similar in both groups. Baseline lab findings were as follows: ApoB: 89.85 ± 17.52 (control), 81.60 ± 12.84 mg/dL (experimental); hs-CRP: 0.18 ± 0.27 (control), 0.17 ± 0.27 mg/L (experimental); LDL-C 113.65 ±23.71 (control), 106.50 ± 18.99 mg/dL (experimental); HDL-C 57.35 ± 14.63 (control), 62.41 ± 16.15 mg/dL (experimental); and triglycerides: 76.00 ± 31.30 (control), 56.77 ± 14.77 mg/dL (experimental), and these values were similar. The values after 12 weeks of intervention were as follows: BMI: 27.37 ± 5.24 (control), 26.36 ± 3.55 (experimental); pulse rate: 78.88 ± 14.00 (control), 74.20 ± 11.90 bpm (experimental); ApoB 87.1 ± 17.38 (control), 85.7 ±20.59 mg/dL (experimental); hs-CRP 0.26 ± 0.22 (control), 0.15 ± 0.14 mg/L (experimental); LDL-C 111.59 ± 20.35 (control), 114.10 ± 26.99 mg/dL (experimental); HDL-C 57.71 ± 12.93 (control), 64.85 ± 13.32 mg/dL (experimental); and triglycerides: 74.71 ± 25.39 (control), 60.80 ± 15.77 mg/dL (experimental). Conclusion At a significance level of 5%, there was no difference between the two groups, either at the baseline or at 12 weeks of intervention. Based on our findings, adding MCT oil and butter to coffee may be safe. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer duration are needed to validate our findings."

      "abstract": "Lettuce is a widely consumed leafy vegetable; it became popular due to its enhanced nutritional content. Recently, lettuce is also regarded as one of the model plants for vegetable production in plant factories. Light and nutrients are essential environmental factors that affect lettuce growth and morphology. To evaluate the impact of light spectra on lettuce, butter lettuce was grown under the light wavelengths of 460, 525, and 660 nm, along with white light as the control. Plant morphology, physiology, nutritional content, and transcriptomic analyses were performed to study the light response mechanisms. The results showed that the leaf fresh weight and length/width were higher when grown at 460 nm and lower when grown at 525 nm compared to the control treatment. When exposed to 460 nm light, the sugar, crude fiber, mineral, and vitamin concentrations were favorably altered; however, these levels decreased when exposed to light with a wavelength of 525 nm. The transcriptomic analysis showed that co-factor and vitamin metabolism- and secondary metabolism-related genes were specifically induced by 460 nm light exposure. Furthermore, the pathway enrichment analysis found that flavonoid biosynthesis- and vitamin B6 metabolism-related genes were significantly upregulated in response to 460 nm light exposure. Additional experiments demonstrated that the vitamin B6 and B2 content was significantly higher in leaves exposed to 460 nm light than those grown under the other conditions. Our findings suggested that the addition of 460 nm light could improve lettuce's biomass and nutritional value and help us to further understand how the light spectrum can be tuned as needed for lettuce production."

METHODS: C57BL/6 male mice (n=12) were randomly assigned to dietary intervention either Fish-HFDS (n=6) or Cocoa-HFDS (n=6) for 22 weeks. Intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests (IP-GTT and IP-ITT) were performed after 20-21 weeks of dietary intervention. Plasma concentrations of c-peptide, insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, and leptin were measured by Milliplex kit. Pancreatic tissues were collected for immunohistochemistry to measure islet number and composition. Tissues were multi-labelled with antibodies against insulin and glucagon, also including expression on Pdx1-positive cells. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fish-HFDS-fed mice showed significantly reduced food intake and body weight gain compared to Cocoa-HFDS-fed mice. Fish-HFDS group had lower fasting blood glucose concentration and area under the curve (AUC) for both GTT and ITT. Plasma c-peptide, insulin, glucagon, and GLP-1 concentrations were increased in the Fish-HFDS group. Interestingly, mice fed the Fish-HFDS diet displayed higher plasma leptin concentration. Histochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in endocrine pancreas β-cells and islet numbers in mice fed Fish-HFDS compared to the Cocoa-HFDS group. Taken together, these findings suggest that in a high-fat/high-sucrose dietary setting, the source of the fat, especially fish oil, can ameliorate the effect of sucrose on glucose homeostasis and endocrine pancreas morphology and function.",

      "abstract": "Background: Interesterification is an industrial processing technique used widely where hard fats are essential for functionality and consumer acceptability, e.g. margarines and lower fat spreads. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare acute cardiovascular effects of functionally equivalent spreads (similar solid fat content) made with interesterified (IE) or non-IE palm-based fats, or spreadable butter. Methods: A randomised, controlled, 4-armed crossover, double-blind study (25 men, 25 women; 35-75 years; healthy; mean BMI 24.5, SD 3.8), compared effects of mixed nutrient meals containing 50 g fat from functionally equivalent products [IE spread, non-IE spread and spreadable butter (SB), with rapeseed oil (RO) as a reference treatment: with 16.7%, 27.9%, 19.3% and 4% palmitic acid, respectively] on 8 h postprandial changes in plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated dilatation; FMD). Circulating reactive oxygen species (estimated using a neutrophil oxidative burst assay), glucose, insulin, NEFA, lipoprotein particle profiles, inflammatory markers (glycoprotein acetylation (Glyc-A) and IL-6), and biomarkers of endotoxemia were measured. Results: Postprandial plasma TAG concentrations after test meals were similar. However following RO versus the 3 spreads, there were significantly higher postprandial apolipoprotein B concentrations, and small HDL and LDL particle concentrations, and lower postprandial extra-large, large, and medium HDL particle concentrations, as well as smaller average HDL and LDL particle sizes. There were no differences following IE compared to the other spreads. Postprandial FMD% did not decrease after high-fat test meals, and there were no differences between treatments. Postprandial serum IL-6 increased similarly after test meals, but RO provoked a greater increase in postprandial concentrations of glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), as well as 8 h sCD14, an endotoxemia marker. All other postprandial outcomes were not different between treatments. Conclusions: In healthy adults, a commercially-available IE-based spread did not evoke a different postprandial triacylglycerol, lipoprotein subclass, oxidative stress, inflammatory or endotoxemic response to functionally-equivalent, but compositionally-distinct alternative spreads.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dairy foods are often a major contributor to dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) intake. However, different SFA-rich foods may not have the same effects on cardiovascular risk factors. We compared full-fat yogurt with low-fat yogurt and butter for their effects on cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy individuals. METHODS: Randomized, two-period crossover trial conducted from October 2022 to April 2023 among 30 healthy men and women (15 to receive full-fat yogurt first, and 15 to receive low-fat yogurt and butter first). Participants consumed a diet with 1.5-2 servings of full-fat (4%) yogurt or low-fat (< 1.5) yogurt and 10-15 g of butter per day for 4 weeks, with 4 weeks wash-out when they consumed 1.5-2 servings of low-fat milk. At baseline, and the end of each 4 weeks, fasting blood samples were drawn and plasma lipids, glycemic and inflammatory markers as well as expression of some genes in the blood buffy coats fraction were determined. RESULTS: All 30 participants completed the two periods of the study. Apolipoprotein B was higher for the low-fat yogurt and butter [changes from baseline, + 10.06 (95%CI 4.64 to 15.47)] compared with the full-fat yogurt [-4.27 (95%CI, -11.78 to 3.23)] and the difference between two treatment periods was statistically significant (p = 0.004). Non-high-density lipoprotein increased for the low-fat yogurt and butter [change, + 5.06 (95%CI (-1.56 to 11.69) compared with the full-fat yogurt [change, - 4.90 (95%CI, -11.61 to 1.81), with no significant difference between two periods (p = 0.056). There were no between-period differences in other plasma lipid, insulin, and inflammatory biomarkers or leukocyte gene expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 and CD36. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that short-term intake of SFAs from full-fat yogurt compared to intake from butter and low-fat yogurt has fewer adverse effects on plasma lipid profile.

Using Minzu schools located in a diverse county of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (North China), as a case study, the authors examine factors behind Minzu teacher stress. Using mixed methods, three main results were identified by analyzing interviews and questionnaires with both the software NVivo and dialogical discourse analysis: societal, school and Self factors. In general, the teachers confirmed that their job was extremely stressful. While some of these aspects derived directly from the specific context of Minzu education (e.g., rural and pastoralist families send their children to towns leading to teachers taking over parents' responsibilities), some elements were also found in other contexts of Chinese education and/or internationally. The article ends with some recommendations specifically about Minzu aspects in the treatment of teacher stress, which will also be of interest for international audiences."

Ketamine attracted attention as a fast-acting glutamatergic antidepressant with ideal physiochemical properties for alternative routes of administration. However, there is no sufficient data for its transdermal use in depression. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated the antidepressant effects of transdermal ketamine delivered via a novel ointment with skin protective, emulsifying and permeation enhancing properties. A shea butter-based 5% (w/w) ketamine ointment or a drug-free vehicle ointment were applied to the shaved dorsal skin of male Wistar rats for 2 days, twice a day. Behavioral despair, locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior were respectively assessed in the forced swim test (FST), open field test (OFT), and elevated plus maze (EPM). The pharmacokinetic profile of the ointment was analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Transdermal ketamine ameliorated behavioral despair without altering general locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior, showing that skin-friendly drug carriers like shea butter may constitute promising alternatives to current routes of delivery for ketamine. Tested transdermal method aims to provide more sustainable drug delivery for long-term treatment schedules. Future studies can investigate its long-term use, side effects and abuse liability.",

We report a pilot randomised controlled trial of an intervention supplementing extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on markers of cardiovascular risk among East Asian Chinese, and European Caucasian individuals. Methods: A cross-over, randomised controlled dietary intervention for 2 weeks was undertaken. Thirty-two adults, healthy, individuals of Chinese and European origin took part in this study. 24-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), and blood lipids, were assessed. Results: Positive benefits of EVOO consumption were observed in all participants. Lower 24-h ambulatory SBP (-4.3 mmHg; p = 0.020), and day-time SBP (5.528 mmHg; p = 0.008), night-time DBP (-3.784 mmHg; p = 0.008) and night-time MAP (-3.747 mmHg; p = 0.007) were seen in all participants independently of covariates. In addition, total cholesterol (7.9 mg/dL; p = 0.017) and LDL-cholesterol (6.5 mg/dL; p = 0.028) were increased with butter but not with olive oil. No significant difference in other cardiovascular risk factors were observed. However, differences were observed between Caucasians and East Asian individuals in the absence of significant differences in lifestyle. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that consumption of EVOO should be advocated as a healthier dietary fat and recommended to replace butter as a dietary strategy to improve cardiovascular health in both Caucasians and East Asian individuals."

The SMM treatment significantly decreased the particle size of PB, damaged cell structure, and released the oil body from cells. The apparent viscosity of PB decreased with the grinding process. Visual inspection revealed that the colloidal stability of PB was improved. The fatty acid composition was not affected by the grinding process. However, the tocopherol contents of the extracted oil slightly increased. Electronic nose and GC-MS analysis indicated that SMM could alter the flavor of PB after grinding for 45 min. Overall, SMM was a potential process technology to manufacture stable nut butter with smooth texture and delightful flavor profile.",

Peroxide levels initially increased until day 40 of storage and then decreased. Butter samples from the control group had the highest amount of peroxide on day 40 (15.25 ± 1.41 meq/kg butter), while samples treated with fucoidan 0.5% had the lowest amount of peroxide (6.35 ± 0.53 meq/kg butter). The acidity of butter treatments increased during storage (p < .05). Butter samples from the control group had the highest acidity at 60 days of storage (0.40 ± 0.033 mg KOH / g butter), while samples treated with 0.5% fucoidan had the lowest acidity (0.17 ± 0.013 mg KOH / g butter). The treated butter samples showed the highest stability. Fucoidan, as an antioxidant, reduces the taste, odor, and discoloration of butter added with fucoidan during storage because it completely removes odorless tasteless powder, and the free radical chain is involved in oxidation and improves product properties. The results showed that there are no significant changes in the acceptance rate of butter treated with fucoidan during 60 days of storage in the refrigerator (p > .05). The sensory scores of the treated butter showed that the sensory properties during the storage period were similar to the control samples, but on day 40 of storage, they decreased. In general, a concentration of 0.5% fucoidan delays the oxidative process and increases shelf life and is selected as a superior treatment in terms of sensory evaluation, and is introduced as a functional food."

Articaine (ATC) is a local anesthetic used at high (4%) concentrations. Since nanopharmaceutical formulations may improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, we encapsulated ATC in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) aiming to increase the anesthetic effect on the inflamed tissue. Moreover, the lipid nanoparticles were prepared with natural lipids (copaiba (Copaifera langsdorffii) oil and avocado (Persia gratissima) butter) that added functional activity to the nanosystem. NLC-CO-A particles (~217 nm) showed an amorphous lipid core structure according to DSC and XDR. In an inflammatory pain model induced by λ-carrageenan in rats, NLC-CO-A improved (30%) the anesthetic efficacy and prolonged anesthesia (3 h) in relation to free ATC. In a PGE2-induced pain model, the natural lipid formulation significantly reduced (~20%) the mechanical pain when compared to synthetic lipid NLC. Opioid receptors were involved in the detected analgesia effect since their blockage resulted in pain restoration. The pharmacokinetic evaluation of the inflamed tissue showed that NLC-CO-A decreased tissue ATC elimination rate (ke) by half and doubled ATC's half-life. These results present NLC-CO-A as an innovative system to break the impasse of anesthesia failure in inflamed tissue by preventing ATC accelerated systemic removal by the inflammatory process and improving anesthesia by its association with copaiba oil."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mechanisms that dictate the preference for ethanol and its addiction are not only restricted to the central nervous system (CNS). An increasing body of evidence has suggested that abusive ethanol consumption directly affects the immune system, which in turn interacts with the CNS, triggering neuronal responses and changes, resulting in dependence on the drug. It is known that neuroinflammation and greater immune system reactivity are observed in behavioral disorders and that these can regulate gene transcription. However, there is little information about these findings of the transcriptional profile of reward system genes in high consumption and alcohol preference. In this regard, there is a belief that, in the striatum, an integrating region of the brain reward system, the interaction of the immune response and the transcriptional profile of the Lrrk2 gene that is associated with loss of control and addiction to ethanol may influence the alcohol consumption and preference. Given this information, this study aimed to assess whether problematic alcohol consumption affects the transcriptional profile of the Lrrk2 gene, neuroinflammation, and behavior and whether these changes are interconnected. METHODS: An animal model developed by our research group has been used in which male C57BL/6 mice and knockouts for the Il6 and Nfat genes were subjected to a protocol of high fat and sugar diet intake and free choice of ethanol in the following stages: Stage 1 (T1)-Dietary treatment, for 8 weeks, in which the animals receive high-calorie diet, High Sugar and Butter (HSB group), or standard diet, American Institute of Nutrition 93-Growth (AIN93G group); and Stage 2 (T2)-Ethanol consumption, in which the animals are submitted, for 4 weeks, to alcohol within the free choice paradigm, being each of them divided into 10 groups, four groups continued with the same diet and in the other six the HSB diet is substituted by the AIN93G diet. Five groups had access to only water, while the five others had a free choice between water and a 10% ethanol solution. The weight of the animals was evaluated weekly and the consumption of water and ethanol daily. At the end of the 12-week experiment, anxiety-like behavior was evaluated by the light/dark box test; compulsive-like behavior by Marble burying, transcriptional regulation of genes Lrrk2, Tlr4, Nfat, Drd1, Drd2, Il6, Il1β, Il10, and iNOS by RT-qPCR; and inflammatory markers by flow cytometry. Animals that the diet was replaced had an ethanol high preference and consumption. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We observed that high consumption and preference for ethanol resulted in (1) elevation of inflammatory cells in the brain, (2) upregulation of genes associated with cytokines (Il6 and Il1β) and pro-inflammatory signals (iNOS and Nfat), downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (Il10), dopamine receptor (Drd2), and the Lrrk2 gene in the striatum, and (3) behavioral changes such as decreased anxiety-like behavior, and increased compulsive-like behavior. Our findings suggest that interactions between the immune system, behavior, and transcriptional profile of the Lrrk2 gene influence the ethanol preferential and abusive consumption."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adherence to a healthy diet is inversely associated with frailty. However, the relationship between nuts, a key food group of Mediterranean diet, and frailty is unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association between nut consumption and frailty in an aging female population. METHODS: This population-based observational study included nonfrail women (≥60 y old) in the NHS from 11 states of the United States. Outcome was incident frailty, defined as having ≥3 of the FRAIL components (fatigue, lower strength, reduced aerobic capacity, multiple chronic conditions, and significant weight loss) and assessed every 4 y from 1992 to 2016. From 1990 to 2014, FFQs were used to assess the intakes of peanuts, peanut butter, walnuts (added in 1998), and other nuts at 4-y intervals. Exposure was total nut consumption, calculated as the sum of intakes of peanuts, peanut butter, walnuts, and other nuts and categorized into <1 serving/mo, 1-3 servings/mo, 1 serving/wk, 2-4 servings/wk, and ≥5 servings/wk. The relations of intakes of peanuts, peanut butter, and walnuts with frailty were also investigated separately. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations between nut consumption and frailty after adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, EI, diet quality, and medication use. RESULTS: Among 71,704 participants, 14,195 incident frailty cases occurred over 1,165,290 person-years. The adjusted HR (95% CI) for consuming ≥5 servings/wk of nuts was 0.80 (0.73, 0.87), as compared with <1 serving/mo. Higher intakes of peanuts and walnuts, but not peanut butter, were also inversely associated with frailty. CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective cohort study showed a strong and consistent inverse association between regular nut consumption and incident frailty.

      "abstract": "Sesame butter (tahini) is a common appetizer and food additive in the Mediterranean basin. Pathogenic strains and mycotoxin content are the most hazardous issues in the final product. This investigation aimed to enhance the quality and safety properties of tahini products against microbial hazards and mycotoxins. Local samples of tahini were evaluated for natural contamination, including mycotoxin level determinations. Agaricus blazei was utilized as a bioactive source and evaluated for the bioactive content of laccase, B-glucan, antioxidant activity, and phenolic content, as well as antimicrobial and antioxidant potency. Two fortification ratios (0.5% and 1.0%) were chosen to apply Agaricus in tahini sesame as a model. Chemical composition, color attributes, sensory properties, emulsion, and oxidative stability were evaluated for the fortified samples versus the control. The results reflected increments of protein (22.91 ± 0.64% to 29.34 ± 0.96%), fiber content (3.09 ± 0.05% to 6.27 ± 0.06%), emulsion stability (84.9 ± 1.24% to 95.41 ± 0.56%), oxidative stability, and bioactive group content. The fortification process is reflected by the absence of Salmonella, Listeria, and E. coli bacteria from contaminated samples after 30 days of storage. The water activity for 1.0% fortification (0.154 ± 0.001) was recorded as lower than the control sample (0.192 ± 0.002). Moreover, the degradation of aflatoxins and zearalenone content was recorded during storage. The degradation ratio reached 68% and 97.2% for 0.5% and 1.0% fortifications, respectively, while zearalenone degradation recorded a decline of 26.7% and 33.7%, respectively, for the same fortification ratios. These results recommended 1.0% lyophilized mushroom fortification as a quality and ameliorative safety treatment for tahini products."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whereas the dietary intake of industrial trans fatty acids (iTFA) has been specifically associated with inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, understanding the impact of dietary fats on human health remains challenging owing to their complex composition and individual effects of their lipid components on metabolism. The aim of this study is to profile the composition of blood, measured by the fatty acid (FAs) profile and untargeted metabolome of serum and the transcriptome of blood cells, in order to identify molecular signatures that discriminate dietary fat intakes. METHODS: In a parallel study, the molecular effects of consuming dairy fat containing ruminant TFA (rTFA) or margarine containing iTFA were investigated. Healthy volunteers (n = 42; 45-69 y) were randomly assigned to diets containing margarine without TFA as major source of fat (wTFA control group with 0.4 g TFA per 100 g margarine), margarine with iTFA (iTFA group with 4.1 g TFA per 100 g margarine), or butter with rTFA (rTFA group with 6.3 g TFA per 100 g butter) for 4 weeks. The amounts of test products were individually selected so that fat intake contributed to 30-33% of energy requirements and TFA in the rTFA and iTFA groups contributed to up to 2% of energy intake. Changes in fasting blood values of lipid profiles (GC with flame-ionization detection), metabolome profiles (LC-MS, GC-MS), and gene expression (microarray) were measured. RESULTS: Eighteen FAs, as well as 242 additional features measured by LC-MS (185) and GC-MS (54) showed significantly different responses to the diets (PFDR-adjusted < 0.05), mainly distinguishing butter from the margarine diets while gene expression was not differentially affected. The most abundant TFA in the butter, i.e. TFA containing (E)-octadec-11-enoic acid (C18:1 t11; trans vaccenic acid), and margarines, i.e. TFA containing (E)-octadec-9-enoic acid (C18:1 t9; elaidic acid) were reflected in the significantly different serum levels of TFAs measured after the dietary interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The untargeted serum metabolome differentiates margarine from butter intake although the identification of the discriminating features remains a bottleneck. The targeted serum FA profile provides detailed information on specific molecules differentiating not only butter from margarine intake but also diets with different content of iTFAs in margarine.

We investigated the chronic effects of diets enriched with palm olein (IV64) (PO), cocoa butter (CB), or extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with oleic acid primarily at the sn-2 position (66%, 75%, 87% sn-2 oleic acid, respectively) of the TG molecule in 40 healthy volunteers participated in this randomized, controlled, single-blinded, crossover trial. Following a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were given standardization meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) cooked with palm olein (IV72). Subjects were randomized to 1 of the 3 intervention groups; receiving baked products (brownies for breakfast and cookies for teatime) prepared with respective test fats accompanied with standardized low-fat meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner prepared with palm olein (IV72) for all groups for 4 weeks in a crossover manner with 2-week washout period (given standardization meals). Anthropometric measurements, blood samples, and dietary intakes were measured before run-in and pre- and post-intervention. No significant difference was observed on the primary outcome of the study total: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. All 3 test fats were found to exhibit similar lipid responses (total cholesterol, TG, lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein-A1, apolipoprotein-B/A-1). Statistical difference was found on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (CB>EVOO by 0.3 mmol/L, P = .003), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (PO>CB by 0.04 mmol/L, P = .02) and apolipoprotein-B (EVOO<PO and CB by 0.03 mmol/L, P = .01 and 0.04 mmol, P = .001 respectively).

      "abstract": "Peanut butter has a very large and continuously increasing global market. The food safety risks associated with its consumption are also likely to have impacts on a correspondingly large global population. In terms of prevalence and potential magnitude of impact, contamination by Salmonella spp., and aflatoxins, are the major food safety risks associated with peanut butter consumption. The inherent nature of the Salmonella spp., coupled with the unique chemical composition and structure of peanut butter, present serious technical challenges when inactivating Salmonella spp. in contaminated peanut butter. Thermal treatment, microwave, radiofrequency, irradiation, and high-pressure processing all are of limited efficacy in inactivating Salmonella spp. in contaminated peanut butter. The removal of aflatoxins in contaminated peanut butter is equally problematic and for all practical purposes almost impossible at the moment. Adopting good manufacturing hygiene practices from farm to table and avoiding the processing of contaminated peanuts are probably some of the few practically viable strategies for minimising these peanut butter food safety risks. The purpose of this review is to highlight the nature of food safety risks associated with peanut butter and to discuss the effectiveness of the initiatives that are aimed at minimising these risks."

      "abstract": "It has been a challenge in developing effective thermal pasteurization processes for foods with high-fat and low-moisture contents like peanut butter, due to a general lack of reliable data on thermal resistance of pathogens in those food matrices. Recent studies on low-moisture foods like wheat flour and almond flour suggest that temperature and water activity (at the process temperatures) are two key factors that influence thermal inactivation of bacteria. In this study, we measured high-temperature water activities of peanut butter of two moisture content (MC), 3.1% and 5.6% (dry basis), and investigated the thermal death kinetics of Salmonella enterica Enteritidis PT 30 (S. Enteritidis) in those samples at 70, 80, 90, and 100 °C. The results indicated that the water activity of peanut butter increased with increasing temperature, e.g., from 0.33 and 0.53 at 23 °C, up to 0.39 and 0.59 at 100 °C, respectively. The thermal death of S. Enteritidis in peanut butter followed the first-order kinetics. Overall, higher moisture content and a higher treatment temperature led to a smaller D-value (decimal reduction time of the survival population) of S. Enteritidis. The maximum D-value was 102.6 ± 15.2 min at MC 3.1% and 70 °C, and the minimum D-value was 0.3 min (predicted) at MC = 5.6% and 100 °C. The log D-value reduced linearly with temperature at a given aw, with Z-values equal to 15.4 °C (for MC = 3.1%) and 12.6 °C (for MC = 5.6%). Based on this study, the first-order kinetic model can be employed for developing and validating thermal pasteurization processes for peanut butter. The moisture content of peanut butter and the process temperature are two key parameters that need to be controlled for sufficient lethality.",

      "abstract": "High-fat and very low-carbohydrate based ketogenic diets have gained considerable popularity as a nonpharmacological strategy for obesity, due to their potential to enhance weight loss and improve glucose homeostasis. However, the effectiveness of a ketogenic diet toward metabolic health is equivocal. To better understand the impact of ketogenic diets in obesity, male and female mice were fed a 60% cocoa butter-based high-fat diet for 16-wk to induce obesity, following which mice were transitioned to either an 85% cocoa butter fat-based ketogenic diet, a 10% cocoa butter fat-based low-fat diet, or maintained on a high-fat diet for an additional 8-wk. All experimental diets were matched for sucrose and protein content and contained an identical micronutrient profile, with complex carbohydrates being the primary carbohydrate source in the low-fat diet. The transition to a ketogenic diet was ineffective at promoting significant body fat loss and improving glucose homeostasis in obese male and female mice. Alternatively, obese male and female mice transitioned to a low-fat and high-complex carbohydrate diet exhibited beneficial body composition changes and improved glucose tolerance that may, in part, be attributed to a mild decrease in food intake and a mild increase in energy expenditure. Our findings support the consumption of a diet low in saturated fat and rich in complex carbohydrates as a potential dietary intervention for the treatment of obesity and obesity-induced impairments in glycemia. Furthermore, our results suggest that careful consideration should be taken when considering a ketogenic diet as a nonpharmacological strategy for obesity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY It has been demonstrated that ketogenic diets may be a nutritional strategy for alleviating hyperglycemia and promoting weight loss in obesity. However, there are a number of inconsistencies with many of these studies, especially with regard to the macronutrient and micronutrient compositions of the diets being compared. Our work demonstrates that a ketogenic diet that is both micronutrient-matched and isoproteic with its comparator diets fails to improve glycemia or promote weight loss in obese mice.",

The results showed that, all the abnormal L/D cycles increased shoot dry weight (DW) of lettuce (by 34-83%) compared with the control, and lettuce DW increased with the L/D cycle period prolonged. The contents of soluble sugar and crude fiber in lettuce showed an overall upward trend with the length of L/D cycle extended, and the highest vitamin C content as well as low nitrate content were both detected in lettuce treated with L120/D60. The light use efficiency (LUE) and electric use efficiency (EUE) of lettuce reached the maximum (respectively 5.37% and 1.76%) under L120/D60 treatment and so were DW, Assimilation rate (A), RC/CS, ABS/CS, TRo/CS and DIo/CS, indicating that longer L/D cycle period was beneficial for the assimilation efficiency and dry matter accumulation in lettuce leaves. The highest shoot fresh weight (FW) and nitrate content detected in lettuce subjected to L24/D12 may be related to the vigorous growth of root, specific L/D cycle seemed to strengthen root growth and water absorption of lettuce. The openness level of RC in PSII (Ψo), ETo/CS, and PIabs were all the highest in lettuce treated with L24/D12, implying that slightly extending the L/D cycle period might promote the energy flowing to the final electron transfer chain. In general, irradiation modes with extended L/D cycle period had the potential to improve energy use efficiency and biomass of lettuce in PFAL. No obvious stress or injury was detected in lettuce subjected to prolonged L/D cycles in terms of plant growth and production. From the perspective of shoot FW, the optimal treatment in this study was L24/D12, while L120/D60 was the recommended treatment as regards of the energy use efficiency and nutritional quality.",

On the contrary, BB-25 and BB-50 induced both increase of HDL-c (51.40 ± 1.69 and 51.00 ± 2.34, respectively) and decrease of LDL-c (103.80 ± 6.87 and 100.50 ± 3.95, respectively) when compared with DG (41.00 ± 2.94 and 132.70 ± 9.41, respectively). In addition, BB promoted a reduction in the risk of atherosclerotic disease by decreasing (p < 0.05) the atherogenic index, coronary artery risk index, and LDL/CT ratio (p < 0.05) and increasing HDL/CT ratio. On the contrary, no changes were observed in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels or in body weight, growth, body mass index, or liver function parameters. Thus, bacuri seed butter at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg/day has positive repercussions on the lipid profile, more precisely on plasma HDL-c and LDL-c, and additionally promotes reduction in the risk of atherosclerosis in hamsters."

      "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease that causes severe tissue damage. Ghee butter from bovine colostrum (GBBC) is a clarified butter produced by heating milk fat to 40 °C and separating the precipitating protein. As colostrum mainly contains fatty acids (FAs), immunoglobulins, maternal immune cells, and cytokines, we hypothesized that it may exert anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the effects of GBBC on experimental AP in mice. Two intraperitoneal (ip) injections of L-arginine (8%) were given 1 h apart to generate the AP murine model. After 12 h from the first L-arginine injection, mice were divided into the following experimental groups: AP mice treated with GBBC (oral gavage (po) every 12 h) and non-treated AP mice (po vehicle every 12 h). Control animals received vehicle only. At 72 h, mice were euthanized. Histopathological examination along with myeloperoxidase (MPO) and amylase/lipase activity assays were performed. In a separate set of experiments, FFAR1 and FFAR4 antagonists were used to verify the involvement of respective receptors. Administration of GBBC decreased MPO activity in the pancreas and lungs along with the microscopical severity of AP in mice. Moreover, treatment with GBBC normalized pancreatic enzyme activity. FFAR1 and FFAR4 antagonists tended to reverse the anti-inflammatory effect of GBBC in mouse AP. Our results suggest that GBBC displays anti-inflammatory effects in the mouse model of AP, with the putative involvement of FFARs. This is the first study to show the anti-inflammatory potential of a nutritional supplement derived from GBBC.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ashtanga Ghrita (AG), an Indian traditional formulation, has been used to promote neuropharmacological activities. AG is made up of clarified cow butter (ghee) and eight different herbs. METHODS: To test whether scopolamine (SCP)-induced dementia and brain oxidative stress can be counteracted by AG, rats were separated into five groups (n=6/group): group one control, group two SCP (1 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) treated and group three to five were co-treated with different doses of AG (1.25, 2.5 and 5 g/kg b.w., orally) and SCP. After the treatment regimen, behavioral (Y-maze test) and brain biochemical changes were measured in all groups. RESULTS: Microbial load and heavy metals were found within permissible limits. Results from attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated the complexation/interaction of herbal phytoconstituents with the functional groups of Ghrita. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of AG exhibited the occurrence of flavonoids, phenolics, glycosides, steroids, triterpenes, tannins, and amino acids. Findings of the experimental study exhibited that AG significantly protected the rats from SCP-induced behavioral dysfunction and brain biochemical alterations. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that AG protects the brain from SCP-induced dementia by promoting brain antioxidant activity and thus could be a promising drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A mixed-methods, randomized controlled trial comparing short- and long-term chiropractic care and exercise therapy for spinal disability in older adults found no between-group differences in the primary outcome. However, those who received long-term management reported greater improvement in neck pain, self-efficacy, function, and balance. This nested qualitative study explored participants' perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of chiropractic care and exercise for spine-related outcomes, with an emphasis on understanding what makes treatment for spine-related problems worthwhile. METHODS: Of 171 individual interviews conducted after completing study treatment, 50 participants (25 per treatment group) were randomly selected for this analysis. Qualitative descriptive analysis included dual coding of verbatim transcripts by 2 investigators (MM and SAS), which was further distilled into a consensus-derived codebook of themes and organized using NVIVO software. RESULTS: Participants described trial interventions as complementary to one another for spine-related disability. Chiropractic care was viewed as improving spinal pain and controlling symptoms, while exercise therapy was noted for its long-term impact on self-efficacy and self-management. These older adults considered changes in pain, global sense of improvement, and improved biomechanical function as making treatment worthwhile. CONCLUSION: Older adults valued nonpharmacologic treatment options that aided them in controlling spine-related symptoms, while empowering them to maintain clinical benefit gained after a course of chiropractic spinal manipulation and exercise. The complementary nature of provider-delivered and active care modalities may be an important consideration when developing care plans. This study underscores the importance of understanding participants' values and experiences when interpreting study results and applying them to practice.",

Its processing and overall quality suffers due to the use of conventional practices, which has probably discouraged the production of product in organized sectors. No scientific intervention has taken place to improve the product quality and process since the inception of makkhan making. As an initiative towards the improvement, the present study is focused to prepare a detail scientific background on chemistry, quality attributes, utilization, preparation methods, and storage of product for identifying challenges and scopes of overall improvement in production status. To validate the opportunities identified for the improvements in production various approaches especially mechanized approaches are suggested in this review."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The fat extracted from the nut of the African Shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa) is called Shea butter. It has multiple uses at the local level as it is used in cosmetic products and as a cocoa butter substitute in chocolate industries. It has a high nutritious value and is also a valuable product on the local, national, and international markets, making it the ideal candidate to research and invest in. AIM: This study is a comparative experimental study of the possible burn healing effects between imported South African raw Shea butter and samples in a Libyan market. METHOD: The control samples were brought from South Africa (Benin traditional markets). A total of 18 different samples were collected from different sale centers in Tripoli, including pharmacies, beauty shops, and spices shops, in addition to one sample brought from Poland. Animal experiment on burn healing effect was carried out on nine male Sprague Dawley (350-400 g) rats aged 6-8 weeks old. After shaving the animal's dorsum hair, a metal cube was used to create a deep second degree burn wound, and the cube was heated to 100°C for 20 seconds. Medication with Shea butter (control, T1, and T2) was initiated daily for one for these groups by the application of a thin film of the Shea butter samples on the burned areas. On days 1, 3, and 7, the rats were anesthetised and a sample from the burned scar tissue and skin adjacent were evaluated using pathological parameters. RESULTS: The histological study indicates that the use of Shea butter T1 as topical treatment induces an immune response, which enhances the form of the presence of a large number of inflammatory cells in the epidermis and dermis layers. The treatment of burned skin with T2 lasted for 72 hours and it showed slightly significant healing in the normal structure of proliferative granulation tissue with accumulation of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells surrounding the sebaceous glands and hair follicles. Small areas of the epidermis which formed few layers were observed and some hair roots were grown. This was well seen in cases of T1 and T2. Shea butter bought as raw might have a bad effect on burned skin. CONCLUSION: Shea butter bought as raw might have bad effect on burned skin. On the other hand, the sample from Poland had a therapeutic effect, which was because of the additives such as avocado oil, grape seed oil, and others.",

Shea butter, a fat produced from the kernels of the shea tree, has historically been used as an indigenous therapy for dermatologic ailments in SSA. Characterizing traditional therapeutic applications for shea butter is important to inform the continued development of TM in SSA. We conducted a literature review aimed at identifying all available publications on the use of shea butter to treat dermatoses within SSA and evaluating patterns of use. We found 24 dermatologic uses across 30 references. The most common study design was descriptive cross-sectional analysis (46.7%), often relying on the use of in-depth interviews, focus groups, and surveys. Eight SSA countries were represented and there were disparities in availability of information across SSA with the eastern and southern regions less likely to be represented. The most frequently investigated conditions were scabies, wound healing, and umbilical cord care. Shea butter was most commonly used in combination with other ingredients to produce a medical treatment with the most frequent adjuvant being Elaeis guineensis, African oil palm. Broad use of TM to treat varied skin diseases throughout SSA warrants increased investigations into this field in order to further develop the capacity of TM as a source of healthcare.",

Inconsistent evidence may be influenced by fatty acid saturation, chain-length, and regio-specificity within triacylglycerol (TAG) molecules. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare eucaloric diets enriched in palm olein (POo), cocoa butter (COB), and soybean oil (SBO) on liver fat concentration in healthy participants. Secondary outcomes included visceral (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous (aSCAT) adipose tissue, plus other obesity and cardiometabolic health outcomes. METHODS: Eighty-three healthy participants (20-45 y, BMI 18.5-27.5 kg/m2) commenced and 64 completed a 16-wk randomized parallel intervention, preceded by a 2-wk run-in. Participants consumed identical eucaloric background diets differing in test fats [contributing 20% total energy intake (%E)], providing 33%E total fat with the following ratios for PUFAs/SFAs/MUFAs: POo, 4.2/13.5/15%E; SBO, 14.4/8.8/9.4%E; COB, 2.3/19.5/11%E. Liver fat and abdominal adiposity were measured at weeks 0 and 16 using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging; all other outcomes were measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 wk. RESULTS: Fat quality did not affect liver fat concentration, VAT, aSCAT, obesity indexes, blood pressure, liver enzymes, leptin, or fasting glucose. Body fat mass decreased with SBO and COB compared with POo. SBO decreased serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, and TC:HDL cholesterol relative to POo [estimated marginal mean (95% CI) differences: -0.57 (-0.94, -0.20) mmol/L; -0.37 (-0.68, -0.07) mmol/L; and -0.42 (-0.73, -0.11) mmol/L, respectively]. No diet differences were observed on HDL cholesterol, TAG, apoA1, apoB, apoB:apoA1, or fecal free fatty acids (FFAs), except for lower FFA pentadecanoic acid (15:0) with COB than with SBO and POo. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adults, when consumed as part of eucaloric typical Australian diets, 3 different dietary fat sources did not differentially affect liver fat concentration and amounts of adipose tissue. Effects on serum lipids were inconsistent across lipid profiles. The findings must be confirmed in metabolically impaired individuals before recommendations can be made.",

      "abstract": "Tengkawang fat (Shorea stenoptera), from an indigenous plant of the Kalimantan forest, has excellent potential as an alternative source of vegetable fat because it has a high level of fatty acids composition. Activated natural bentonite can be used as a bleaching agent to improve the quality of tengkawang fat. This research aims to reduce the acidity, peroxide number values and identify the physicochemical properties (fatty acid composition, nutrients, and thermal) of tengkawang butter. Initially, tengkawang samples from Nanga Yen and Sintang were pre-treated using the degumming process with 1% phosphoric acid and the neutralization process with a 1 M NaOH 10% w/w solution. The results show that the acidity (mg NaOH/g) of the tengkawang fat samples was reduced from 11.00 to 3.36 when using bentonite activated at 200 °C. The bentonite activated with 0.5 M HCl reduced the acidity to 3.61. The peroxide number (meq O2/kg) of the tengkawang fat samples was reduced from 9.45 to 4.84 and 3.47 by bleaching with thermal-activated and acid-activated bentonites, respectively. Peroxide value correlates with β-carotene content. The smaller of the β-carotene content, the smaller the peroxide value. The acidity, peroxide number, and iodine number values from tengkawang fat after treatment adhere to the SNI 2903: 2016 standard. The main content of fatty acids in tengkawang fat is palmitic acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid. These results show that both products are suitable for the food industry in terms of the acid and peroxide numbers. The application of this research results will assist local people in increasing the economic value of the product from tengkawang plant, which is an indigenous plant from Kalimantan."

Buttering was carried out on the 12Cr side with the Thyssen 617 filler metal. Furthermore, post weld heat treatment (PWHT) was conducted at 730 °C with a holding time of 4 h followed by furnace cooling. Optical Microscopy (OM) was conducted to study the microstructural evolution in dissimilar material welding as a result of PWHT. Moreover, Scanning Electron Microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was employed to determine the elemental concentrations in all important regions of the butter weld before and after the PWHT. In addition, the effect of PWHT on the corrosion kinetics of the butter weld was also investigated by potentiodynamic polarization measurements in 5 wt.% NaCl + 0.5 wt.% CH3COOH electrolyte at room temperature, 30 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C. The corrosion activation parameters were also determined for both the samples by using Arrhenius plots. The results revealed the higher susceptibility of corrosion of the butter weld after PWHT, which was attributed to the reduced Cr content in the heat affected zone of the 12Cr region due to the sensitization effect of the heat treatment, resulting in higher corrosion rates."

In this paper, the enrichment of c9,t11-CLA from butter was optimized and the preventive effect of dietary c9,t11-CLA against breast cancer in vivo was investigated. Results showed that the concentration of c9,t11-CLA increased more than 10 times via a one-step urea complexation. Furthermore, the dietary c9,t11-CLA showed obvious preventive effect against breast cancer in decreasing the tumor weight and volume, and reducing the tumor incidence up to 50%. In addition, the expression of progesterone receptor and Ki-67 decreased significantly with the treatment of c9,t11-CLA. In conclusion, the dietary c9,t11-CLA enriched from butter showed a preventive effect against breast cancer in vivo via the inhibition of the hormonal receptor and cell proliferation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This paper provided new insight into the preparation of specific c9,t11-CLA isomer. It can be enriched from butter in large-scale with low-cost by urea complexation. Meanwhile, the enriched dietary c9,t11-CLA can be further processed into cancer prevention functional foods.",

Agricultural products that are biofortified with α-linolenic acid (ALA), the precursor of n-3 LC PUFA, have been launched to the market, but their impact on BAT function is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ALA-biofortified butter on lipid metabolism and thermogenic functions in the BAT. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet containing ALA-biofortified butter (n3Bu, 45% calorie from fat) for ten weeks in comparison with the isocaloric high-fat diets prepared from conventional butter or margarine. The intake of n3Bu significantly reduced the whitening of BAT and increased the thermogenesis in response to acute-cold treatment. Also, n3Bu supplementation is linked with the remodeling of BAT by promoting bioconversion into n-3 LC PUFA, FA elongation and desaturation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Taken together, our results support that ALA-biofortified butter is a novel source of n-3 PUFA, which potentiates the BAT thermogenic function.",

In contrast, the main lactones in margarines were δ-decalactone and δ-dodecalactone. The total lactone content in butters and fermented butters increased by approximately two-fold upon heat treatment, whereas, heat treatment did not affect the lactone content in margarine.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is estimated to affect 0.44-2.8% of the Indian population. Moisturizers are a key adjuvant psoriasis treatment strategy, but data regarding their effectiveness, safety and compliance pattern in an Indian context are lacking. Hence, this real-world study on an intensive plant-based butter moisturizing cream (Venusia ® Max) was conducted among Indian patients with psoriasis. METHODS: This was an observational, patient-reported outcomes (PRO) study in patients with psoriasis aged 18-75 years who were prescribed the cream in routine clinical practice, as per clinician's discretion, over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was improvement from baseline in quality of life assessed using the Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) at 4 weeks of the study period. The secondary outcome measures were improvement in dryness using the Dry Skin/Ichthyosis Area and Severity Index (DASI) score at 4 weeks, safety and compliance. The DLQI and DASI scores were recorded by the clinicians at baseline and after 2 (optional) and 4 weeks of starting the cream. Safety was assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: The study included 400 patients from 9 outpatient dermatology centers across India. Of 400 patients, 384 completed the study. A significant reduction in both the mean DLQI score (66.7%; p < 0.001) and mean DASI score (84.6%; p < 0.001) was observed at week 4 after starting the cream vs. baseline in the overall population. Overall, the cream showed a good safety and compliance profile during the study period. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from the PRO study suggests that use of the intensive plant-based butter moisturizing cream in a real-world scenario has a noticeable impact on improving the quality of life and reducing the skin dryness associated with psoriasis over 4 weeks. The moisturizing cream may serve as a valuable adjuvant treatment option for the management of psoriasis. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CTRI/2017/03/008023. FUNDING: Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd."

This study demonstrated the therapeutic effects of BOB on second degree burn. METHODS: Second degree burn model was created in rats. Experimental groups were assigned to Healthy, Burn, Silver Sulfadiazine (SS) and BOB. The effects of BOB were evaluated on skin regeneration, vesicles and bullae and fibroblast activity by histopathological analyses and wound contraction percent were determined. Transforming Growth Factor-Beta1 (TGF-β1) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-alpha (VEGF-α) mRNA expressions were analyzed with Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction. All parameters analyzed at 3rd, 7th, 14th days. RESULTS: The BOB treatment increased TGF-β1 and VEGF-α expressions compared to Burn group. The histopathological analyses showed that epidermis and dermis layers injured due to burn. BOB treatment augmented the regeneration of these layers and increased fibroblast activity and keratinization which are play important role on the new blood vessels production. Also with the BOB treatment we showed wound contraction levels were higher than Burn and SS treatment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that beeswax-olive oil-butter mixture impregnated bandage treatment in a second-degree burn rat model improved burn wound healing and encouraged skin renewal via modulating tissue TGF-β1 and VEGF-α.",

The purposes of the current work were to assess the antioxidant and antimicrobial effect of walnut kernel septum membranes hydroalcohol extract (WHE) in traditional butter (TB). Antioxidant characterization of the extract was screened through methods of DPPH, reducing power and total phenolic assays. After preparation of traditional butter from yogurt, WHE was incorporated into TB at three different concentrations; 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.5% and compared with a control, BHT and tocopherol treated samples (200 mg of BHT and tocopherol/kg). Microbiological studies (Staphylococcus aureus, Coliforms, Psychrotrophic bacteria, yeasts and molds) were done during 90 days of storage time. Changes in Anisidine value (AV), acid value, peroxide value (PV) free fatty acids (FFA), Schaal and Totox value were monitored at 45-day intervals. Sensory evaluation was done using 10 semi-trained panelists based on the 5-point hedonic scale. It was found that the total phenolic content of WHE was 368.86 mg GAE/g. The BHT had higher antioxidant activity than WHE inhibiting 92.3% of the DPPH radical at 600 μg/mL. Peroxide value of TB treated with tocopherol, BHT and WHE 0.5% was 0.29 ± 0.07, 0.39 ± 0.07 and 0.52 ± 0.04 respectively. Furthermore, the WHE incorporated butter has shown low levels of free fatty acids, Schaal and Totox value when compared to control treatment. The WHE 0.5% incorporated sample had the most antimicrobial activity and it inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms (except Staphylococcus aureus) used in the study. Among the treated TB, the samples treated with the control and WHE 0.05% had the highest sensory attributes score. The study showed that WHE could be an excellent natural origin of antimicrobial and antioxidant agents which can be used in butter."

The purpose of this study was to validate baking as an adequate lethality step in controlling Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes during the production of peanut butter (PB)-filled pretzels and whole wheat (WW) pita chips. Two dough types, PB-filled pretzel and WW pita chip with varying water activities (0.96 to 0.98), were inoculated (target level, ∼108 to 109 CFU/g) with a multistrain cocktail of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes in separate trials and were baked at 300°F (148.9°C) and 350°F (176.6°C) for 0, 5, 10, 17, 25, and 30 min. Following baking, samples were rapidly cooled and analyzed for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes by the pour plate method. Uninoculated samples were analyzed for total viable aerobic plate count (APC) and Enterobacteriaceae counts. Water activity analysis was also performed. The experiment was replicated three times. Nonlinear regression was used to estimate the baking times required to achieve a minimum of 4- and 5-log reduction in APC, Salmonella, and L. monocytogenes. A 4- and 5-log reduction in APC was predicted following a treatment at 350°F for 3.3 and 5.6 min in WW pita chip product, respectively. Following a treatment of 350°F for 10 and 25 min, Enterobacteriaceae and APC counts were below the detection limit (<1 log CFU/g), respectively, in all of the PB-filled pretzel samples. Salmonella and L. monocytogenes counts decreased with increasing baking time regardless of the temperature used. Significant reductions (≥5-log reduction) were estimated in Salmonella and L. monocytogenes in product baked at 350°F for 15.5 and 17.5 min in WW pita chip dough and PB-filled pretzel dough, respectively. Both pathogens were below the detection limit (<1 log CFU/g) in PB-filled pretzel and WW pita chip products under baking conditions of 350°F for 25 and 30 min, respectively. This study demonstrates that PB-filled pretzel and WW pita chip products, when baked to saleable quality, will not present a public health risk from the standpoint of Salmonella or L. monocytogenes.",

      "abstract": "The physical qualities of butter are affected by the physical properties of the cream used to make it. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of high-intensity ultrasound (HIU) on the physical properties of cream and butter. High-intensity ultrasound (frequency: 20 kHz, amplitude: 108 µm), often called sonication, was applied for 0, 10, 30, 60, and 90 s using a 1.27-cm-diameter tip to heavy cream (40% fat; 300 g) that was aged at 7.5°C with low agitation (40 rpm) for 90 min. Sonicated cream was churned at 7.5°C until butter grains were formed. The solid fat content (SFC), melting behavior, and average fat droplet size of cream were measured after HIU treatment. Butter was characterized by SFC and melting behavior immediately after production and was tested for SFC, melting behavior, and hardness after storage for 24 h at 5°C. High-intensity ultrasound did not affect the average fat droplet size of cream. Sonicating cream for 30, 60, and 90 s slightly decreased SFC due to the temperature increase (2-6°C) that occurred during HIU application. Two melting peaks were observed at approximately 17 and 33°C in all the cream samples. A significantly lower peak temperature was observed in cream sonicated for 10 s compared with creams sonicated for 30 and 60 s. A relatively shorter churning time of sonicated cream compared with nonsonicated cream was observed, possibly because HIU weakens the fat globule membrane. Two melting peaks were observed in all butter samples at approximately 16 and 33°C. Treatment with HIU for 10 to 60 s significantly increased the hardness of butter. When HIU was applied to cream for 10 s, the hardest butter was obtained, with the lowest onset temperatures and highest enthalpy values for both melting peaks. Treatment with HIU for 10 s promoted crystallization of low-melting-point triacylglycerols (TAG) during churning, which resulted in a harder material. Significantly lower enthalpy values for the high-melting-fraction TAG were observed in butters treated with HIU for 60 and 90 s compared with non-HIU-treated butter, which suggests that a longer duration of HIU promotes melting of high-melting-point TAG. The hardness of butter was correlated with the enthalpy values of the low-melting fraction and with total enthalpy values of fresh butter. However, further crystallization occurred in the butter during 24 h of storage at 5°C, and all differences in enthalpy values disappeared. In conclusion, exposure of cream to HIU can be used to modify the physical properties of butter, and the effects of HIU depend on the length of HIU treatment.",

METHODS: Sixteen healthy adults, aged 24.1 ± 3.5 years, reported in the morning to a nutrition assessment laboratory for two days of data collection, having fasted 8 to 12 hours. On day 1 (control), fasting blood glucose (BG) was measured using glucometers, then participants consumed two slices of white bread and 250 mL apple juice (60 g carbohydrate) within 15 minutes. BG was measured again at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the first bite of the meal. On day 2, the protocol was repeated, except 32 g (2 tbsp) of peanut butter was added to the meal (treatment). RESULTS: The spike in BG was significantly lower on the treatment versus control day (35.8 ± 16.4 vs. 51.0 ± 20.8 mg/dL, respectively; p < 0.01), and BG was significantly lower on the treatment day at 15, 30, and 60 minutes post-meal consumption (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that supplementation with 32 g (2 tbsp) peanut butter attenuates the magnitude of BG spike and overall glycemic response to high-glycemic index meal and may be a practical, beneficial strategy to prevent undesirable elevations in BG.",

SIGNIFICANCE: Leishmaniasis is considered an infectious disease, with high incidence and capacity to produce deformities. The first-line treatment recommended by WHO, with pentavalent antimonials, is aggressive and very toxic. Therefore, the development of topical treatments can emerge as a promising and less offensive alternative. METHODS: The developed formulations were evaluated for organoleptic characteristics, centrifugation resistance, globule size, pH, electrical conductivity, viscosity, spreadability, drug content, preliminary stability, in vitro release profile, evaluation of antileishmanial activity using promastigotes forms of Leishmania major as infecting agents, macrophage cytotoxicity and selectivity index (IS). RESULTS: Formulated emulsions presented organoleptic characteristics compatible with its constituents; pH values were suitable for topical application, ranging from 4.73 to 5.02; introduced non-Newtonian shear thinning system; drug content was within the established standards, and the most suitable kinetic model of release was the first order. Regarding the in vitro assays, formulations containing both 1% and 3% of AmB presented similar outcomes, indicating a synergism between the bacuri butter and the drug, possibly showing a reduction on cytotoxicity to host cells. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the formulations developed showed promising antileishmanial action and high potential for topical use.",

However, there is increasing interest in whether various dietary oils or fats with different fatty acid profiles such as extra virgin coconut oil may have different metabolic effects but trials have reported inconsistent results. We aimed to compare changes in blood lipid profile, weight, fat distribution and metabolic markers after four weeks consumption of 50 g daily of one of three different dietary fats, extra virgin coconut oil, butter or extra virgin olive oil, in healthy men and women in the general population. DESIGN: Randomised clinical trial conducted over June and July 2017. SETTING: General community in Cambridgeshire, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer adults were recruited by the British Broadcasting Corporation through their websites. Eligibility criteria were men and women aged 50-75 years, with no known history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes, not on lipid lowering medication, no contraindications to a high-fat diet and willingness to be randomised to consume one of the three dietary fats for 4 weeks. Of 160 individuals initially expressing an interest and assessed for eligibility, 96 were randomised to one of three interventions; 2 individuals subsequently withdrew and 94 men and women attended a baseline assessment. Their mean age was 60 years, 67% were women and 98% were European Caucasian. Of these, 91 men and women attended a follow-up assessment 4 weeks later. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised to extra virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter and asked to consume 50 g daily of one of these fats for 4 weeks, which they could incorporate into their usual diet or consume as a supplement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in serum LDL-C; secondary outcomes were change in total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC and HDL-C), TC/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C; change in weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, per cent body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and C reactive protein. RESULTS: LDL-C concentrations were significantly increased on butter compared with coconut oil (+0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65 mmol/L, P<0.0001) and with olive oil (+0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.60 mmol/L, P<0.0001), with no differences in change of LDL-C in coconut oil compared with olive oil (-0.04, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.19 mmol/L, P=0.74). Coconut oil significantly increased HDL-C compared with butter (+0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.30 mmol/L) or olive oil (+0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28 mmol/L). Butter significantly increased TC/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C compared with coconut oil but coconut oil did not significantly differ from olive oil for TC/HDL-C and non-HDL-C. There were no significant differences in changes in weight, BMI, central adiposity, fasting blood glucose, systolic or diastolic blood pressure among any of the three intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Two different dietary fats (butter and coconut oil) which are predominantly saturated fats, appear to have different effects on blood lipids compared with olive oil, a predominantly monounsaturated fat with coconut oil more comparable to olive oil with respect to LDL-C. The effects of different dietary fats on lipid profiles, metabolic markers and health outcomes may vary not just according to the general classification of their main component fatty acids as saturated or unsaturated but possibly according to different profiles in individual fatty acids, processing methods as well as the foods in which they are consumed or dietary patterns. These findings do not alter current dietary recommendations to reduce saturated fat intake in general but highlight the need for further elucidation of the more nuanced relationships between different dietary fats and health.

      "abstract": "Cows' butterfat may be adulterated with animal fat materials like tallow which causes increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels upon consumption. There is no reliable technique to detect and quantify tallow adulteration in butter samples in a feasible way. In this study a highly sensitive near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods was developed to detect as well as quantify the level of tallow adulterant in clarified butter samples. For this investigation the pure clarified butter samples were intentionally adulterated with tallow at the following percentage levels: 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, 9%, 11%, 13%, 15%, 17% and 20% (wt/wt). Altogether 99 clarified butter samples were used including nine pure samples (un-adulterated clarified butter) and 90 clarified butter samples adulterated with tallow. Each sample was analysed by using NIR spectroscopy in the reflection mode in the range 10,000-4000 cm-1, at 2 cm-1 resolution and using the transflectance sample accessory which provided a total path length of 0.5 mm. Chemometric models including principal components analysis (PCA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), and partial least-squares regressions (PLSR) were applied for statistical treatment of the obtained NIR spectral data. The PLSDA model was employed to differentiate pure butter samples from those adulterated with tallow. The employed model was then externally cross-validated by using a test set which included 30% of the total butter samples. The excellent performance of the model was proved by the low RMSEP value of 1.537% and the high correlation factor of 0.95. This newly developed method is robust, non-destructive, highly sensitive, and economical with very minor sample preparation and good ability to quantify less than 1.5% of tallow adulteration in clarified butter samples.",

Each vehicle showed a different pattern of cortisol elevation. Vegetable shortening was found to be a more suitable vehicle for long-term cortisol elevation [elevated at 3, 6 and 9 days post treatment (dpt)], while cocoa butter may be better suited for short-term cortisol elevation (only elevated at 3 dpt). Additionally, plasma cortisol levels were higher with cortisol-vegetable shortening than with cortisol-cocoa butter implants. Plasma glucose levels were elevated 6 and 9 dpt for fishes injected with cortisol-vegetable shortening, but did not change relative to controls and shams in cortisol-cocoa butter fishes. In conclusion, vegetable shortening and cocoa butter are both viable techniques for cortisol manipulation in fishes in temperate climates, providing researchers with different options depending on study objectives.",

      "abstract": "Background: Controversies persist concerning the association between intake of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and cardiovascular disease risk.Objective: We compared the impact of consuming equal amounts of SFAs from cheese and butter on cardiometabolic risk factors.Design: In a multicenter, crossover, randomized controlled trial, 92 men and women with abdominal obesity and relatively low HDL-cholesterol concentrations were assigned to sequences of 5 predetermined isoenergetic diets of 4 wk each separated by 4-wk washouts: 2 diets rich in SFAs (12.4-12.6% of calories) from either cheese or butter; a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diet (SFAs: 5.8%, MUFAs: 19.6%); a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich diet (SFAs: 5.8%, PUFAs: 11.5%); and a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (fat: 25%, SFAs: 5.8%).Results: Serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations were similar after the cheese and butter diets but were significantly higher than after the carbohydrate diet (+3.8% and +4.7%, respectively; P < 0.05 for both). LDL-cholesterol concentrations after the cheese diet were lower than after the butter diet (-3.3%, P < 0.05) but were higher than after the carbohydrate (+2.6%), MUFA (+5.3%), and PUFA (+12.3%) diets (P < 0.05 for all). LDL-cholesterol concentrations after the butter diet also increased significantly (from +6.1% to +16.2%, P < 0.05) compared with the carbohydrate, MUFA, and PUFA diets. The LDL-cholesterol response to treatment was significantly modified by baseline values (P-interaction = 0.02), with the increase in LDL cholesterol being significantly greater with butter than with cheese only among individuals with high baseline LDL-cholesterol concentrations. There was no significant difference between all diets on inflammation markers, blood pressure, and insulin-glucose homeostasis.Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that the consumption of SFAs from cheese and butter has similar effects on HDL cholesterol but differentially modifies LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with the effects of carbohydrates, MUFAs, and PUFAs, particularly in individuals with high LDL cholesterol. In contrast, SFAs from either cheese or butter have no significant effects on several other nonlipid cardiometabolic risk factors. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02106208.",

Ghee solid lipid nanoparticles (GSLN) were characterized through dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, and UV-visible spectrometry. Formulations were generated with varying ratios of surfactant to lipid, resulting in a maximum TMZ entrapment efficiency of ˜70%. Optimal formulations were found to have an average size and polydispersity of ˜220 nm and 0.340, respectively. Release kinetics revealed TMZ-loaded GSLN (TMZ@GSLN) retained 10% of its pay-load at 2 h with ˜53% released in 5 h. Metabolic activity on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) revealed GSLN treatment resulted in an increase in viability following 3 d while treatment of glioblastoma LN-229 cells with TMZ@GSLN resulted in a significant decrease. Evaluation of diffusion of TMZ across a reconstructed HUVEC monolayer demonstrated TMZ@GSLN resulted in a significantly higher diffusion of drug when compared to free TMZ. This data suggests GSLN pose a promising delivery vehicle for TMZ-based therapeutics. Collectively, this data demonstrates GSLN exhibit favorable drug carrier properties with anti-proliferative properties in glioblastoma cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "The abolition of the milk quota system that was in place in Europe was abolished in 2015, which instigated an immediate increase in milk production in many European countries. This increase will aid in addressing the world's ever growing demand for food, but will incur increased stresses on the environmental impact and sustainability of the dairy industry. In this study, an environmental life cycle assessment was performed in order to estimate the environmental impacts associated with the manufacture of milk powder and butter in the Republic of Ireland. A farm gate to processing factory gate analysis, which includes raw milk transportation, processing into each product and packaging, is assessed in this study. Operational data was obtained from 5 dairy processing factories that produce milk powder (4 of which also produce butter). Results for each environmental impact category are presented per kilogram of product. Energy consumption (raw milk transportation and on-site electrical and thermal energy usage) contributes, on average, 89% and 78% of the total global warming potential, for milk powder and butter respectively, for the life cycle stages assessed. Similarly, energy consumption contributes, on average, 86% and 96% of the total terrestrial acidification potential for milk powder and butter respectively, for these life cycle stages. Emissions associated with wastewater treatment contribute approximately 10% and 40% to the total freshwater eutrophication potential and marine eutrophication potential, respectively, for both milk powder and butter production. In addition, packaging materials also has a significant contribution to these environmental impact categories for butter production. Results were also presented for three milk powder products being manufactured by the factories surveyed: skim milk powder, whole milk powder and full fat milk powder. The analysis presented in this paper helps to identify opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts associated with post-farm processing of milk powder and butter.",

This process leads to achieve softer; more spreadable, and ultimately healthier product for consumers. In addition it could prevent hardening of texture especially in winter. METHODS: Firstly, Pasteurized cream with different fat contents (40 & 45% fat) was passed through heat treatments, and then it was injected to a continuous churn. Textural and melting behavior and fatty acid composition of butter were analyzed. RESULTS: Increasing the fat content of cream (from 40 to 45 %) and holding time (from 3h to 5h) in mid-temperature (18 ºC) and reducing the churning temperature (from 12 ºC to 10 ºC), resulted in soft butter texture and improved butter spreadability. Loss Tangent (tan δ) was increased from 0.11 to 0.74 (T=15 ºC;f=1Hz). The melting temperature of butter was decreased from 36ºC to 32ºC and total trans fatty acid content was decreased from 3.2 % to 1.87 %. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that such heating process (which has been studied and reported in patents) absorbs the low- SFC fats of the cream, integrates them into the butter texture a softer and more spreadable product.",

In contrast, gestational exposure to HFO or HFO+BPA did not affect spermatogenesis. Sham-implanted, gestational exposed groups also had normal spermatogenesis. Loss of ERα expression in round spermatids and premature expression of protamine-1 in diplotene spermatocytes were features associated with impaired spermatogenesis.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several recent articles have called into question the deleterious effects of high animal fat diets due to mixed results from epidemiologic studies and the lack of clinical trial evidence in meta-analyses of dietary intervention trials. We were interested in examining the theoretical effects of substituting plant-based fats from different types of margarine for animal-based fat from butter on the risk of atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: We prospectively studied 71,410 women, aged 50-79 years, and evaluated their risk for clinical myocardial infarction (MI), total coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, and atherosclerosis-related CVD with an average of 13.2 years of follow-up. Butter and margarine intakes were obtained at baseline and year 3 by means of a validated food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression using a cumulative average diet method was used to estimate the theoretical effect of substituting 1 teaspoon/day of three types of margarine for the same amount of butter. RESULTS: Substituting butter or stick margarine with tub margarine was associated with lower risk of MI (HRs = 0.95 and 0.91). Subgroup analyses, which evaluated these substitutions among participants with a single source of spreadable fat, showed stronger associations for MI (HRs = 0.92 and 0.87). Outcomes of total CHD, ischemic stroke, and atherosclerosis-related CVD showed wide confidence intervals but the same trends as the MI results. CONCLUSIONS: This theoretical dietary substitution analysis suggests that substituting butter and stick margarine with tub margarine when spreadable fats are eaten may be associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction.",

Peanut butter inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes (0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 aw) were treated with a 915 MHz microwave with 2, 4, and 6 kW for up to 5 min. Six kW 915 MHz microwave treatment for 5 min reduced these three pathogens by 1.97 to >5.17 log CFU/g. Four kW 915 MHz microwave processing for 5 min reduced these pathogens by 0.41-1.98 log CFU/g. Two kW microwave heating did not inactivate pathogens in peanut butter. Weibull and Log-Linear + Shoulder models were used to describe the survival curves of three pathogens because they exhibited shouldering behavior. Td and T5d values were calculated based on the Weibull and Log-Linear + Shoulder models. Td values of the three pathogens were similar to D-values of Salmonella subjected to conventional heating at 90 °C but T5d values were much shorter than those of conventional heating at 90 °C. Generally, increased aw resulted in shorter T5d values of pathogens, but not shorter Td values. The results of this study can be used to optimize microwave heating pasteurization system of peanut butter.",

Peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), radical scavenging activity (RSA) and free fatty acids (FFA) of ghee samples were analyzed during the study. PV, TBA and FFA of ghee samples increased significantly while radical scavenging activity (RSA) of ghee samples decreased significantly at accelerated temperature (T3) as compared to the temperatures at T1 and T2. Effect of storage temperature on development of peroxides and TBA of ghee samples was significantly higher than the effect of treatment and storage period while treatment had more significant effect on the change in FFA and RSA as compared to storage temperature and storage period. Ghee incorporated with orange peel extract (OPE) showed stronger activity in quenching DPPH radicals and least development of PV, TBA and FFA than ghee incorporated with BHA and control. The study revealed that orange peel could be a good natural source of antioxidants which can be used in fat rich food products like ghee to retard oxidative deterioration."

SETTING: Paediatric dermatology clinic at a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Consecutive paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis who were interested in trying a new moisturiser were recruited between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014. Swabs and cultures from the right antecubital fossa and the worst eczematous area, disease severity (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index), skin hydration, and transepidermal water loss were obtained prior to and following 4-week usage of a cream/cleanser containing lipid complex with shea butter extract (Ezerra cream; Hoe Pharma, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia). Global or general acceptability of treatment was documented as 'very good', 'good', 'fair', or 'poor'. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients with atopic dermatitis were recruited; 74% reported 'very good' or 'good', whereas 26% reported 'fair' or 'poor' general acceptability of treatment of the Ezerra cream; and 76% reported 'very good' or 'good', whereas 24% reported 'fair' or 'poor' general acceptability of treatment of the Ezerra cleanser. There were no intergroup differences in pre-usage clinical parameters of age, objective SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index, pruritus, sleep loss, skin hydration, transepidermal water loss, topical corticosteroid usage, oral antihistamine usage, or general acceptability of treatment of the prior emollient. Following use of the Ezerra cream, mean pruritus score decreased from 6.7 to 6.0 (P=0.036) and mean Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index improved from 10.0 to 8.0 (P=0.021) in the 'very good'/'good' group. There were no statistically significant differences in the acceptability of wash (P=0.526) and emollients (P=0.537) with pre-trial products. When compared with the data of another ceramide-precursor moisturiser in a previous study, there was no statistical difference in efficacy and acceptability between the two products. CONCLUSIONS: The trial cream was acceptable in three quarters of patients with atopic dermatitis. Patients who accepted the cream had less pruritus and improved quality of life than the non-accepting patients following its usage. The cream containing shea butter extract did not differ in acceptability or efficacy from a ceramide-precursor product. Patient acceptability is an important factor for treatment efficacy. There is a general lack of published clinical trials to document the efficacy and skin biophysiological effects of many of the proprietary moisturisers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Butter is known to have a cholesterol-raising effect and, therefore, has often been included as a negative control in dietary studies, whereas the effect of moderate butter intake has not been elucidated to our knowledge. OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of moderate butter intake, moderate olive oil intake, and a habitual diet on blood lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), glucose, and insulin. DESIGN: The study was a controlled, double-blinded, randomized 2 × 5-wk crossover dietary intervention study with a 14-d run-in period during which subjects consumed their habitual diets. The study included 47 healthy men and women (mean ± SD total cholesterol: 5.22 ± 0.90 mmol/L) who substituted a part of their habitual diets with 4.5% of energy from butter or refined olive oil. RESULTS: Study subjects were 70% women with a mean age and body mass index (in kg/m²) of 40.4 y and 23.5, respectively. Butter intake increased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol more than did olive oil intake (P < 0.05) and the run-in period (P < 0.005 and P < 0.05, respectively) and increased HDL cholesterol compared with the run-in period (P < 0.05). No difference in effects was observed for triacylglycerol, hsCRP, insulin, and glucose concentrations. The intake of saturated fatty acids was significantly higher in the butter period than in the olive oil and run-in periods (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate intake of butter resulted in increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared with the effects of olive oil intake and a habitual diet (run-in period). Furthermore, moderate butter intake was also followed by an increase in HDL cholesterol compared with the habitual diet. We conclude that hypercholesterolemic people should keep their consumption of butter to a minimum, whereas moderate butter intake may be considered part of the diet in the normocholesterolemic population.",

      "abstract": "In Southwest China, tea polyphenols are usually utilized by way of butter tea. Tea polyphenols inhibit the absorption and biosynthesis of fatty acids in vivo, but the effects of butter on the pharmacokinetics of tea polyphenols have drawn less concern. A rapid UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to quantitatively determine the catechins in the plasma, feces and bile of rats after the oral administration of tea polyphenol or its combination with butter. In comparison with the single tea polyphenol treatment, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of the free EGCG, EGC, EC, GCG, GC and ECG significantly decreased after the co-administration of butter. The mean residence times (MRT) of the free EGCG, EGC, EC, GC and ECG were also significantly prolonged. When the plasma samples were treated with β-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase, the pharmacokinetic parameters of the total catechins (free and conjugated forms) were not affected by the co-administration of butter. These results indicated that the total absorption of catechins was not affected by butter, but the metabolism of catechins had been changed. Furthermore, the fecal catechins were significantly increased by butter. The total fecal amount and excretion ratio of all catechins were increased highly. The biliary excretion of EGCG, EGC, EC, GCG and GC was significantly increased by the co-administration of butter. To sum up, the butter changed the metabolism of catechins in vivo by decreasing the plasma concentration of the free catechins but increasing the conjugated catechins.",

As CLA isomers were shown to be actively incorporated and metabolized in the brains of rats, we hypothesized that feeding a diet naturally enriched in CLA would affect the activity and expression of Pla 2 -encoding genes in rat brain tissue, with possible implications for memory. To test this hypothesis, Wistar rats were trained for the inhibitory avoidance task and fed a commercial diet (control) or experimental diets containing either low CLA- or CLA-enriched butter for 4 weeks. After this period, the rats were tested for memory retrieval and killed for tissue collection. Hippocampal expression of 19 Pla 2 genes was evaluated by qPCR, and activities of PLA2 groups (cPLA2, iPLA2, and sPLA2) were determined by radioenzymatic assay. Rats fed the high CLA diet had increased hippocampal mRNA levels for specific PLA2 isoforms (iPla 2 g6γ; cPla 2 g4a, sPla 2 g3, sPla 2 g1b, and sPla 2 g12a) and higher enzymatic activity of all PLA2 groups as compared to those fed the control and the low CLA diet. The increment in PLA2 activities correlated significantly with memory enhancement, as assessed by increased latency in the step-down inhibitory avoidance task after 4 weeks of treatment (rs = 0.69 for iPLA2, P < 0.001; rs = 0.81 for cPLA2, P < 0.001; and rs = 0.69 for sPLA2, P < 0.001). In face of the previous reports showing reduced PLA2 activity in AD brains, the present findings suggest that dairy products enriched in cis-9, trans-11 CLA may be useful in the treatment of this disease.",

In Brazil, except for drugs (or formulations) with long-term (half-life) effects, ML are registered for use in bovines. Indiscriminate use of ML may result in the presence of residues in milk and dairy products due to their lipophilic properties and thermal stability. This study applied a method of liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection, recently developed and validated for the determination of residues of abamectin, doramectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin in butter. The method was applied to 38 samples of commercial butter purchased in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between June and September 2013, analyzed in triplicate. Ivermectin was detected in 89.5% of the samples, with concentrations between 0.3 and 119.4 µg/kg; 76.3% of the samples contained doramectin (0.6 to 64.7 µg/kg) and 55.2% contained abamectin (0.7 to 4.5 µg/kg). Most butter samples (76.3%) contained residues of more than 1 ML; however, no residues of moxidectin were detected. The results showed a high incidence of the presence of avermectins in butter samples. Butter is not included in the Brazilian National Plan for Control of Residues and Contaminants in Animal Products. As ML residues concentrate in lipophilic compounds, butter and other fatty dairy products should be screened for the presence of ML residues.",

      "abstract": "Microbial contamination of peanut butter by Salmonella poses a significant health risk as Salmonella may remain viable throughout the product shelf life. Effective cleaning and sanitation of processing lines are essential for preventing cross-contamination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a cleaning and sanitation procedure involving hot oil and 60% isopropanol, ± quaternary ammonium compounds, to decontaminate pilot-scale processing equipment harboring Salmonella. Peanut butter inoculated with a cocktail of four Salmonella serovars (∼ 7 log CFU/g) was used to contaminate the equipment (∼ 75 L). The system was then emptied of peanut butter and treated with hot oil (90 °C) for 2 h followed by sanitizer for 1 h. Microbial analysis of food-contact surfaces (7 locations), peanut butter, and oil were conducted. Oil contained ∼ 3.2 log CFU/mL on both trypticase soy agar with yeast extract (TSAYE) and xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD), indicating hot oil alone was not sufficient to inactivate Salmonella. Environmental sampling found 0.25-1.12 log CFU/cm(2) remaining on processing equipment. After the isopropanol sanitation (± quaternary ammonium compounds), no Salmonella was detected in environmental samples on XLD (<0.16 log CFU/cm(2)). These data suggest that a two-step hot oil clean and isopropanol sanitization treatment may eliminate pathogenic Salmonella from contaminated equipment.",

      "abstract": "Peanut butter has been associated with several large foodborne salmonellosis outbreaks. This research investigates the potential of high hydrostatic pressure processing (HPP) for inactivation of Salmonella in peanut butter of modified composition, both by modifying its water activity as well by the addition of various amounts of nisin. A cocktail of six Salmonella strains associated with peanut butter and nut-related outbreaks was used for all experiments. Different volumes of sterile distilled water were added to peanut butter to increase water activity, and different volumes of peanut oil were added to decrease water activity. Inactivation in 12% fat, light roast, partially defatted peanut flour, and peanut oil was also quantified. Nisaplin was incorporated into peanut butter at four concentrations corresponding to 2.5, 5.0, 12.5, and 25.0 ppm of pure nisin. All samples were subjected to 600 MPa for 18 min. A steady and statistically significant increase in log reduction was seen as added moisture was increased from 50 to 90%. The color of all peanut butter samples containing added moisture contents darkened after high pressure processing. The addition of peanut oil to further lower the water activity of peanut butter further reduced the effectiveness of HPP. Just over a 1-log reduction was obtained in peanut flour, while inactivation to below detection limits (2 log CFU/g) was observed in peanut oil. Nisin alone without HPP had no effect. Recovery of Salmonella after a combined nisin and HPP treatment did show increased log reduction with longer storage times. The maximum log reduction of Salmonella achieved was 1.7 log CFU/g, which was comparable to that achieved by noncycling pressure treatment alone. High pressure processing alone or with other formulation modification, including added nisin, is not a suitable technology to manage the microbiological safety of Salmonella-contaminated peanut butter.",

Since many of these disease models involve transgenic mice that are frequently aged and fragile, the commonly used oro-gastric gavage method of drug administration often confounds measured outcomes due to repeated stress and high attrition rates caused by esophageal complications. We employed a novel drug formulation in a peanut butter (PB) pellet readily consumed by mice and compared the stress response as measured by plasma corticosterone levels relative to oral administration via traditional gavage. Acute gavage produced significant elevations in plasma corticosterone comparable to those observed in mice subjected to stress-induced hyperthermia. In contrast, corticosterone levels following consumption of PB pellets were similar to levels in naive mice and significantly lower than in mice subjected to traditional gavage. Following sub-chronic administration, corticosterone levels remained significantly higher in mice subjected to gavage, relative to mice administered PB pellets or naive controls. Furthermore, chronic 30day dosing of a BACE inhibitor administered via PB pellets to PSAPP mice resulted in expected plasma drug exposure and Aβ40 lowering consistent with drug treatment demonstrating target engagement. Taken together, this alternative method of oral administration by drug formulated in PB pellets results in the expected pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with attenuated stress levels, and is devoid of the detrimental effects of repetitive oral gavage.",

Zinc, iron, vitamins A, C and E, and polyunsaturated fatty acids all play possible roles in the etiology and possible treatment of allergies due to their numerous immunomodulating properties. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the immunomodulating effect of recommending a nutrient-rich diet consisting of green vegetables, beef, whole milk and full-fat butter. METHODS: We conducted a case-controlled, non-randomized, retrospective study. Children between the ages of 1 and 18 years with non-specific elevated IgE were included. Baseline and follow-up measurements of serum total IgE and clinical outcomes were retrospectively collected and compared for 49 children who received the dietary advice (to eat green vegetables, beef, whole milk and full-fat butter) and 56 children who did not. RESULTS: The initial analysis showed a significantly greater decrease in IgE in the intervention group compared to the control group; a 9.2 kU/l versus a 0.1 kU/l decrease, respectively (P = 0.02). When supplement (vitamin D) use was taken into account, however, no significant difference was produced by the dietary effect alone (unstandardized coefficient = 71.3 kU/l, P = 0.16). 53.2 % of participants in the intervention group reported considerable improvement in symptoms versus 28.6 % in the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, the effects of nutrients and vitamins on the decrease in IgE are promising. The separate contributions of dietary advice and/or supplements need to be investigated in the future.",

The inactivation of S. Typhimurium in the 3 types of treated peanut butter product over a 14 day storage period and the influence of storage temperature at 4 (refrigerated) and 25 °C (ambient), and peanut butter product formulation were investigated. Three types of peanut butter product inoculated with S. Typhimurium to a level of ca. 6.6 log CFU/g and subjected to gamma irradiation experienced significant (p<0.05) reductions of 1.3 to 1.9, 2.6 to 2.8, and 3.5 to 4.0 log CFU/g at doses of 1, 2, and 3 kGy, respectively. The time required to reduce S. Typhimurium in peanut butter product to undetectable levels was 14, 5, and 5 days at 25°C after exposure to 3 kGy for products A, B, and C, respectively, and 7 days at 25 °C following exposure to 2 kGy for product C. During storage at 4 and 25 °C, survival of S. Typhimurium was lowest in product C compared to products A and B. Water activity (a(w)) of peanut butter product was likely the most critical factor affecting pathogen survival. When a(w) is reduced, radiolysis of water is reduced, thereby decreasing antimicrobial action. Overall, death was more rapid at 25 °C versus 4 °C for all peanut butter products during 14 day storage. Following gamma irradiation, acid values of peanut butter product were not significantly different from the control, and general observations failed to detect changes in color and aroma, even though lightness observed using a colorimeter was slightly reduced on day 0. The use of gamma irradiation has potential in preventing spoilage of post-packaged food by destroying microorganisms and improving the safety and quality of foods without compromising sensory quality.",

The application of 1 μM and 100 μM JA induced an increase in the concentration of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids and phenolic acids. Flavonoid levels were also increased after treatment with 100 μM AA and ABA. Some of the elicitor concentrations used also caused an increase in the levels of other phytochemicals, such as chlorophyll a (1 μM and 100 μM AA, 50 μM ABA); chlorophyll b (100 μM AA); carotenoids (100 μM AA, 1 μM JA and 100 μM ABA) and vitamin C (100 μM AA, 100 μM JA). The highest antiradical activity was noted after treatment with 100 μM AA, 100 μM JA. 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability was positively and significantly correlated with flavonoid, chlorophyll and carotenoid levels. These results may suggest that the antiradical activity of lettuce was determined not only by phenolics, but also by other bioactive compounds. Elicitation did not change the sensory quality of lettuce. Therefore, treatment with elicitors could be a useful tool for improving the health-promoting qualities of lettuce without the loss of sensory quality.",

      "abstract": "The temperature treatment of cream is the time-consuming step in butter production. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to partial coalescence, such as fat crystallization during ripening and churning of the cream, will contribute to optimization of the production process. In this study, ripening and churning of cream were performed in a rheometer cell and the mechanisms of cream crystallization during churning of the cream, including the effect of ripening time, were investigated to understand how churning time and partial coalescence are affected. Crystallization mechanisms were studied as function of time by differential scanning calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance and by X-ray scattering. Microstructure formation was investigated by small deformation rheology and static light scattering. The study demonstrated that viscosity measurements can be used to detect phase inversion of the emulsion during churning of the cream in a rheometer cell. Longer ripening time (e.g., 5h vs. 0 h) resulted in larger butter grains (91 vs. 52 µm), higher viscosity (5.3 vs. 1.3 Pa · s), and solid fat content (41 vs. 13%). Both ripening and churning time had an effect on the thermal behavior of the cream. Despite the increase in solid fat content, no further changes in crystal polymorphism and in melting behavior were observed after 1h of ripening and after churning. The churning time significantly decreased after 0.5h of ripening, from 22.9 min for the cream where no ripening was applied to 16.23 min. Therefore, the crystallization state that promotes partial coalescence (i.e., aggregation of butter grains) is obtained within the first hour of cream ripening at 10 °C. The present study adds knowledge on the fundamental processes of crystallization and polymorphism of milk fat occurring during ripening and churning of cream. In addition, the dairy industry will benefit from these insights on the optimization of butter manufacturing.",

      "abstract": "Butter and other milk fat-based products are valuable products for the dairy industry due to their unique taste, their textural characteristics, and nutritional value. However, an increased consumer demand for low-fat-based products increases the need for an increased essential understanding of the effective factors governing the structure of milk fat-based products. Today, 2 manufacturing techniques are available: the churning method and the emulsification method. The first is typically used for production of butter with a globular structure, which has become increasingly popular to obtain low-fat-based products, typically without presence of milk fat globules. The microstructure of milk fat-based products is strongly related to their structural rheology, hence applications. Structural behavior is not determined by one single parameter, but by the interactions between many. This complexity is reviewed here. Parameters such as thermal treatment of cream prior to butter making, water content, and chemical composition influence not only crystal polymorphism, but also the number and sizes of fat crystals. The number of crystal-crystal interactions formed within the products is related to product hardness. During storage, however, postcrystallization increases the solid fat content and strengthens the fat crystal network. The fat crystal network is strengthened by the formation of more and stronger crystal-crystal interactions due to mechanically interlinking of fat crystals, which occurs during crystal growth. Postcrystallization is directly linked to chemical composition. The initially observed microstructural difference causing different rheological behavior will disappear during storage due to postcrystallization and formation of more crystal-crystal interactions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is considerable interest in dairy products from low-input systems, such as mountain-pasture grazing cows, because these products are believed to be healthier than products from high-input conventional systems. This may be due to a higher content of bioactive components, such as phytanic acid, a PPAR-agonist derived from chlorophyll. However, the effects of such products on human health have been poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of milk-fat from mountain-pasture grazing cows (G) and conventionally fed cows (C) on risk markers of the metabolic syndrome. DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized, 12-week, parallel intervention study, 38 healthy subjects replaced part of their habitual dietary fat intake with 39 g fat from test butter made from milk from mountain-pasture grazing cows or from cows fed conventional winter fodder. Glucose-tolerance and circulating risk markers were analysed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: No differences in blood lipids, lipoproteins, hsCRP, insulin, glucose or glucose-tolerance were observed. Interestingly, strong correlations between phytanic acid at baseline and total (P<0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (P=0.0001) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of effects on blood lipids and inflammation indicates that dairy products from mountain-pasture grazing cows are not healthier than products from high-input conventional systems. Considering the strong correlation between LDL cholesterol and phytanic acid at baseline, it may be suggested that phytanic acid increases total and LDL cholesterol.

This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of radio-frequency (RF) heating to inactivate S.

Samples were treated for a maximum time of 90 s in a 27.12 MHz RF heating system. Samples were prepared in the form of peanut butter cracker sandwiches and placed in the middle of two parallel-plate electrodes. After 90 s of RF treatment, the log reductions of S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 were 4.29 and 4.39 log CFU/g, respectively, in creamy peanut butter. RF treatment of chunky peanut butter for 90 s also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced levels of S.

Color values and sensory characteristics of the RF treated peanut butter and crackers were not significantly (P > 0.05) different from the control. These results suggest that RF heating can be applied to control pathogens in peanut butter products without affecting quality.",

      "abstract": "Health and nutrition professionals advise consumers to limit consumption of saturated fatty acids and increase the consumption of foods rich in n-3 fatty acids. Researchers have previously reported that feeding extruded flaxseed, which is high in C18:3n-3, improves the fatty acid profile of milk and dairy products to less saturated fatty acids and to more C18:3n-3. Fat concentrations in milk and butter decreased when cows were fed higher concentrations of extruded flaxseed. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal rate of flaxseed supplementation for improving the fatty acid profile without decreasing production characteristics of milk and dairy products. By using a double 5 × 5 Latin square design, 10 mid- to late-lactation Holstein cows were fed extruded (0, 0.91, 1.81, and 2.72 kg/d) and ground (1.81 kg/d) flaxseed as a top dressing for 2-wk periods each. At the end of each 2-wk treatment period, milk and serum samples were taken. Milk was subsequently manufactured into butter and fresh Mozzarella cheese. Increasing supplementation rates of extruded flaxseed improved the fatty acid profile of milk, butter, and cheese gradually to less saturated and atherogenic fatty acids and to more C18:3n-3 by increasing concentrations of C18:3n-3 in serum. The less saturated fatty acid profile was associated with decreased hardness and adhesiveness of refrigerated butter, which likely cause improved spreadability. Supplementation rates of extruded flaxseed did not affect dry matter intake of the total mixed ration, milk composition, and production of milk, butter, or cheese. Flaxseed processing did not affect production, fatty acid profile of milk, or texture of butter and cheese. Feeding up to 2.72 kg/d of extruded flaxseed to mid- to late-lactation Holstein cows may improve nutritional and functional properties of milk fat without compromising production parameters.",

Furthermore, the crystal structure was linked to the rheological properties and microstructure of the butter using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Butter produced from non-matured cream mainly formed α- and β'-crystals with minor traces of β-crystals. Maturing of the cream caused a transition from α- to β'- and β-form. The rheological behaviour of slow cooled butter deviated from the matured ones by having a lower elastic modulus, caused by a weaker crystal network.

      "abstract": "In published data the thermal destruction of Salmonella species in peanut butter deviates from pseudo-first-order kinetics. The reasons for such deviation are unknown. This study examined both the method used to measure the thermal destruction rate and the method of growth of the microorganisms to explain variations in destruction kinetics. Growth on a solid matrix results in a different physiological state that may provide greater resistance to adverse environments. In this study, Salmonella Tennessee and Oranienburg were grown for 24 h at 37°C under aerobic conditions in broth and agar media to represent planktonic and sessile cell growth, respectively. Peanut butter was held at 25°C and tested for Salmonella levels immediately after inoculation and at various time intervals up to 2 weeks. Thermal resistance was measured at 85°C by use of a newly developed thin-layer metal sample holder. Although thermal heat transfer through the metal device resulted in longer tau values than those obtained with plastic bags (32.5 ± 0.9 versus 12.4 ± 1.9 s), the bags have a relative variability of about 15 % compared with about 3 % in the plates, allowing improved uniformity of sample treatment. The two serovars tested in the thin-layer device showed similar overall thermal resistance levels in peanut butter regardless of growth in sessile or planktonic states. However, thermal destruction curves from sessile cultures exhibited greater linearity than those obtained from planktonic cells (P = 0.0198 and 0.0047 for Salmonella Oranienburg and Salmonella Tennessee, respectively). In addition, both Salmonella serovars showed significantly higher survival in peanut butter at 25°C when originally grown on solid media (P = 0.001) with a <1-log loss over 2 weeks as opposed to a 1- to 2-log loss when grown in liquid culture. Consequently, the use of cells grown on solid media may more accurately assess the survival of Salmonella at different temperatures in a low-water-activity environment such as peanut butter.",

For the 8 mid-lactation Holstein cows in this study, milk yield was not significantly affected by treatment, averaging 32.3 ± 1.28 kg/d. Milk fat content was higher for PAS⁻, averaging 5.05 compared with 4.10 ± 0.17% for the mean of other treatments, and was significantly depressed with microalgae supplementation (3.97 vs. 4.69 ± 0.17%). The saturated fatty acid level in the milk of cows fed TMR⁻ was significantly higher than that of the other treatments (66.9 vs. 61.2 g/100 g of FA). The level of monounsaturated FA was lowered by feeding TMR⁻ (27.4 vs. 32.0 g/100 g of FA), whereas levels of polyunsaturated FA were elevated by feeding PAS+ compared with the mean of the other treatments (6.54 vs. 5.07 g/100 g of FA). Feeding the rumen-protected microalgae increased the DHA content of milk more than 4-fold (0.06 to 0.26 g/100g of FA) with the PAS treatment. The conjugated linoleic acid content of milk was highest for PAS+ compared with the other treatments (4.18 vs. 3.41 g/100g of FA). In general, the fatty acid composition of butter followed that of milk. Overall, feeding the TMR supplemented with the rumen-protected microalgae increased the levels of volatile products of oxidation in milk and butter. No effect of forage type or microalgae supplementation was observed on the oxidative stability or antioxidant capacity of milk, although the oxidative stability of butter exposed to UV was reduced with microalgae supplementation, particularly with TMR, as assessed by using the ferric reducing ability of plasma assay.",

AO and BY showed no cytotoxicity at 0.1 μl/ml and 0.1 μg/ml concentration, respectively. AO caused significant increase in ROS after 30 min and RNS after 24 h in GB cells while no change was observed following BY treatment. Enhanced level of COX-2 was observed following AO (0.1 μl/ml) and BY (0.1 μg/ml) treatment to cells for 24 h. AO treatment caused phosphorylation of ErbB2, AKT, ERK, and JNK along with increased thymidine uptake indicating cell proliferation ability in GB cells. BY treatment also showed significant expression of these proteins with the exception of phosphorylated JNK. These results suggest that AO and BY have cell proliferative potential in GB cells following up-regulation of COX-2 and ErbB2; however, their downstream signaling molecules and free radical generation have differential response, indicating that the mechanism of proliferation is different for both compounds and may have relevance in gall bladder cancer.",

Mutagenic properties of 1,2-dicarbonyls have previously been empirically linked to their possible interaction with DNA nucleobases. This study for the first time identifies chemically the adduct of DA with 2-deoxyguanosine. Selective reactivity of DA with 5'-TTTGTTTTT-3' over 5'-TTTTTTTTT-3' indicated its propensity to modify specifically the guanosine residue. Treatment of plasmid DNA, pBR322, with DA induced changes in electrophoretic mobility that are typical of ternary structure disruption. Such DNA nucleobase interaction of DA translated into increased apoptosis in DA-treated SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50) = 0.114 ± 0.0421 mM). The traditional carbonyl scavengers metformin, 2-thiobarbituric acid, and d-penicillamine protected cells from DA toxicity in proportion to their rates of reaction with DA, with d-penicillamine causing a maximal increase in the IC(50) to 5.23 ± 0.0992 mM when co-incubated with DA.",

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of a butter naturally enriched in rTFAs, of which vaccenic acid is the predominant isomer, on plasma lipid concentrations among healthy women. DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized, crossover controlled study, 61 healthy women aged 19-70 y were fed 2 isoenergetic diets lasting 4 wk each. The 2 diets were defined as moderately high in rTFAs (3.7 g/d, 1.5% of daily energy) and control (0.9 g/d, 0.3% of daily energy). RESULTS: No significant effect of the rTFA diet was found on total plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A-I, and triglyceride concentrations compared with the control diet. There was a small yet statistically significant reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations with the rTFA diet (-2.8%; P = 0.004), which was significant (P for the BMI × treatment interaction = 0.006) among women with a BMI (in kg/m(2)) ≥25 (-5.2%; P = 0.004; n = 18) but not among women with a BMI <25 (-1.2%; P = 0.13; n = 43). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that an increase in dietary rTFAs equivalent to ∼1% of daily energy has no significant effect on LDL but may be associated with a reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations, particularly in overweight women.

This effect may be due to the high calcium content of cheese, which results in a higher excretion of fecal fat. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to compare the effects of diets of equal fat content rich in either hard cheese or butter or a habitual diet on blood pressure and fasting serum blood lipids, C-reactive protein, glucose, and insulin. We also examined whether fecal fat excretion differs with the consumption of cheese or butter. DESIGN: The study was a randomized dietary intervention consisting of two 6-wk crossover periods and a 14-d run-in period during which the subjects consumed their habitual diet. The study included 49 men and women who replaced part of their habitual dietary fat intake with 13% of energy from cheese or butter. RESULTS: After 6 wk, the cheese intervention resulted in lower serum total, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations and higher glucose concentrations than did the butter intervention. Cheese intake did not increase serum total or LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with the run-in period, during which total fat and saturated fat intakes were lower. Fecal fat excretion did not differ between the cheese and butter periods. CONCLUSION: Cheese lowers LDL cholesterol when compared with butter intake of equal fat content and does not increase LDL cholesterol compared with a habitual diet.

      "abstract": "Forty-three peanut butter samples from Khartoum State, Sudan, were analyzed for aflatoxins (AFs, AFB1 + AFB2 + AFG1 + AFG2) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection after extraction with methanol:water (8:1, v/v) and clean-up using chloroform. All samples were contaminated with AFs, with total AF levels ranging between 26.7 and 853 μg/kg, and a mean total AF level of 287 ± 200.5 μg/kg. The highest concentrations were found for AFB1, (28 positive samples, maximum 534 μg/kg), while AFG1 was most frequently detected (43 positive samples, maximum 401 μg/kg). AFB2 (42 positive samples, maximum 3.2 μg/kg) and AFG2 (4 positive samples, maximum 30 μg/kg) were also present in these samples. The mean AF contamination levels found in this study exceeded by far all international regulations concerning maximum levels for this group of toxins. From the data, it is concluded that the levels of AF contamination in peanut butter from the Kartoum area are quite alarming, and may pose serious health hazards to consumers. Therefore, an intervention strategy to manage AF in peanut butter is urgently needed."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The effect of electron beam (e-beam) radiation on the recovery of Salmonella serotypes Tennessee (ATCC 10722) and Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) in creamy peanut butter over a 14-d storage period at 22 °C was studied. Each Salmonella type was independently inoculated into peanut butter and subjected to e-beam doses that ranged from 0 to 3.1 kGy, confirmed by film dosimetry. After 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 14-d of storage, microbial analyses were conducted. Survivors were recovered on growth and selective media using standard spread-plating methods. Microbial counts (CFU/g) were log-converted and differences were determined by ANOVA and Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences test. When samples were not e-beam-treated, there were no significant changes (P > 0.05) in microbial numbers over time. In e-beamed samples, microbial numbers decreased over time; however, reductions were not always significant. Initial recovery rates (R-rates) 2 d after e-beam treatment were significantly different for the 2 strains of Salmonella and between recovery media (P < 0.05); however, these differences did not persist for the remainder of the storage period (P > 0.05) indicating that injured cells were not able to survive in the high-fat, low-water activity peanut butter environment. R-rates for both strains of Salmonella were maintained until day 14 when there were significant reductions in Salmonella Typhimurium (P < 0.05). These results indicate that Salmonella Tennessee and Salmonella Typhimurium will survive in peanut butter when exposed to nonlethal doses of e-beam irradiation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Electron beam (e-beam) irradiation is an alternative to thermal processing; this technique inactivates microorganisms and insects that might be present in a food by generating radiation by accelerated electrons that inactivate organisms directly because of interaction with cell components and indirectly by producing free radicals that disrupt integrity of the cell membrane. E-beam radiation will reduce the number of probable microbiological hazards that could be present while the food remains generally unaffected in texture, taste, and nutritional value. A recent study showed e-beam irradiation to be effective at reducing both Salmonella Tennessee and Typhimurium in peanut butter by one log after exposure to less than 1 kGy, highlighting the need to explore this process further.",

      "abstract": "About 1.2 billion pounds of peanut butter are consumed annually in the United States. In 2008 to 2009, an outbreak involving Salmonella Typhimurium in peanut butter led to a recall of over 3900 products by over 200 companies. More than 700 people became sick, 100 were hospitalized, and 9 people died from this outbreak. This study examines the efficacy of high-pressure processing (HPP) to decrease S. Typhimurium American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 53647 inoculated into peanut butter and model systems. The viability of S. Typhimurium in peanut butter stored at room temperature was investigated. A culture of S. Typhimurium (6.88 log CFU/g) was inoculated into peanut butter. Following 28 d at 20 °C there was a 1.23-log reduction. Approximately 10(6) to 10(7) CFU/g S. Typhimurium were inoculated into 4 brands of peanut butter, 3 natural peanut butters and peanut flour slurries at 2, 5, and 10% peanut flour protein in peanut oil and in distilled water. All were treated at 600 MPa for 5 min at 45 °C. While significant differences were found between natural peanut butter and peanut protein mixtures, the reduction was <1.0 log. The peanut flour/oil mixtures had a 1.7, 1.6, and 1.0-log reduction from HPP (2, 5, and 10% protein, respectively) whereas peanut flour/water mixtures had a 6.7-log reduction for all protein levels. Oil had a protective effect indicating HPP may not help the microbial safety of water-in-oil food emulsions including peanut butter. Practical Application: There have been multiple outbreaks of foodborne illness involving peanut butter products. This study looks at the potential use of high-pressure processing to reduce the bacteria that may be in peanut butter.",

However, the effect of rapeseed oil on the markers of subclinical atherosclerosis is not known. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of dietary intake of cold-pressed turnip rapeseed oil (CPTRO) and butter on serum lipids, oxidized LDL and arterial elasticity in men with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Thirty-seven men with metabolic syndrome completed an open and balanced crossover study. Treatment periods lasted for 6 to 8 weeks and they were separated from each other with an eight-week washout period. Subjects maintained their normal dietary habits and physical activity without major variations. The daily fat adjunct consisted either of 37.5 grams of butter or 35 mL of Virgino R CPTRO. Participants were asked to spread butter on bread on the butter period and to drink CPTRO on the oil period. The fat adjunct was used as such without heating or frying. RESULTS: Compared to butter, administration of CPTRO was followed by a reduction of total cholesterol by 8% (p < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol by 11% (p < 0.001). The level of oxidized LDL was 16% lower after oil period (p = 0.024). Minimal differences in arterial elasticity were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Cold-pressed turnip rapeseed oil had favourable effects on circulating LDL cholesterol and oxidized LDL, which may be important in the management of patients at high cardiovascular risk.",

Thirty-six Prim'Holstein cows at 104 d in milk were sorted into 3 groups by milk production and milk fat globule size. Three diets were assigned: a total mixed ration (control) consisting of corn silage (70%) and concentrate (30%), or a supplemented ration based on the control ration but where part of the concentrate energy was replaced on a dry matter basis by 2.1% (LIN1) or 4.3% (LIN2) extruded linseed. The increased amounts of extruded linseed linearly decreased milk fat content and milk fat globule size and linearly increased the percentage of milk unsaturated FA, specifically alpha-linolenic acid and trans FA. Extruded linseed had no significant effect on butter color or on the sensory properties of butters, with only butter texture in the mouth improved. The LIN2 treatment induced a net improvement of milk nutritional properties but also created problems with transforming the cream into butter. The butters obtained were highly spreadable and melt-in-the-mouth, with no pronounced deficiency in taste. The LIN1 treatment appeared to offer a good tradeoff of improved milk FA profile and little effect on butter-making while still offering butters with improved functional properties.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children with cancer in resource limited countries are often malnourished at diagnosis. Acute malnutrition is associated with more infectious complications and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in major surgery. METHODS: All new patients with the clinical diagnosis of a Wilms tumour admitted in the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi from January 2007 until June 2008 were included. We documented anthropometric parameters, tumour size and serum levels of micronutrients at diagnosis. Corrected weight (body weight - tumour weight) was repeated after 4 weeks of preoperative chemotherapy. During therapy oral feeds were encouraged and a locally made ready to use therapeutic peanut butter-based food (chiponde) supplied. RESULTS: A high rate of acute malnutrition was found in patients with Wilms tumour at diagnosis (45-55%), much higher than in community controls (11%). Patients (40%) and community controls (37%) had a similar, high rate of stunting (low height for age), a sign of chronic malnutrition. Tumour size at diagnosis and the degree of acute malnutrition at diagnosis was correlated; patients with a larger tumour had more severe acute malnutrition (r = -0.88, P < 0.01). With a supply of chiponde, 7 of 18 patients had a >5% increase in corrected weight during preoperative chemotherapy. Patients with a more positive nutritional course had a better tumour response to chemotherapy (r = 0.52, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, few micronutrient deficiencies were found, except for low serum levels of vitamin A (44% of patients). CONCLUSION: Acute malnutrition, superimposed on chronic malnutrition, is common in patients with Wilms tumour in Malawi. Earlier presentation needs to be encouraged. Chiponde, a peanut butter based ready-to-use-therapeutic-food, is an attractive means of nutritional support which needs further study.",

These fatty acids may be considered as functional foods, and the concentration in milk can be increased by e.g. sunflower oil supplementation to the dairy cow feed. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of regular butter with a special butter naturally enriched in c9,t11-CLA and VA on plasma lipids in female growing pigs. The experimental period lasted for three weeks and the two diets provided daily either 5.0 g c9,t11-CLA plus 15.1 g VA or 1.3 g c9,t11-CLA plus 3.6 g VA. RESULTS: The serum concentrations of c9,t11-CLA, VA and alpha-linolenic acid were increased and myristic (14:0) and palmitic acid (16:0) were reduced in the pigs fed the CLA+VA-rich butter-diet compared to regular butter, but no differences in plasma concentrations of triacylglycerol, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, LDL particle size distribution or total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol were observed among the two dietary treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Growing pigs fed diets containing butter naturally enriched in about 20 g c9,t11-CLA plus VA daily for three weeks, had increased serum concentrations of alpha-linolenic acid and decreased myristic and palmitic acid compared to pigs fed regular butter, implying a potential benefit of the CLA+VA butter on serum fatty acid composition. Butter enriched in CLA+VA does not appear to have significant effect on the plasma lipoprotein profile in pigs.",

Most cases of salmonellosis are due to ingestion of contaminated food items such as eggs, dairy products, and meats, but almost any foodstuff can be implicated, including peanut butter, as seen during a recent outbreak of more than 600 Salmonella infections. Although outbreaks often gain national media attention, the majority of nontyphoidal Salmonella infections in the United States occur sporadically. Risk factors for salmonellosis include gastric hypoacidity, recent use of antibiotics, extremes of age, and immunosuppressive conditions. Clinical manifestations of the infection most commonly involve self-limited gastroenteritis, but bacteremia and endovascular and localized infections may occur. Most cases of gastrointestinal involvement are self-limited, and antibiotic therapy is reserved for persons at risk for complicated disease. Preventive strategies by both industry and consumers are advocated to further reduce the occurrence of nontyphoidal salmonellosis.",

      "abstract": "A washing treatment was applied to caprine cream before churning in order to improve phospholipids and MFGM protein purification from buttermilk and butter serum. Cream obtained from a first separation was diluted with water and separated a second time using pilot plant equipment. Regular and washed creams were churned to produce buttermilk and butter, from which butter serum was extracted. The washing treatment allowed a significant decrease of the casein content. As a result, the phospholipids-to-protein ratios in washed buttermilk and butter serum were markedly increased by 2.1 and 1.7-folds respectively, which represents an advantage for the production of phospholipids concentrates. However, when compared with bovine cream, lower phospholipids-to-protein ratios were observed when the washing treatment was applied to caprine cream. A higher concentration of MFGM protein and a lower retention of phospholipids during washing treatment are responsible for the lower phospholipids-to-protein ratios in buttermilk and butter serum obtained from caprine cream. The phospholipids distribution in the butter making process was similar to the one obtained from bovine regular and washed cream. Phospholipids were preferentially concentrated in the butter serum rather than the buttermilk fraction. This simple approach permitted the production of caprine and bovine butter sera extracts containing up to 180 and 240 g phospholipids/kg sera, respectively, on a dry basis.",

The objective was to determine if such treatment would lead to a reduction in the allergenic properties of the peanut extract and butter. Peanut samples were PUV treated using a Xenon RS-3000C under the following conditions: 3 pulses/s, 14.6 cm from the central axis of the lamp, 4 min (extract) or 3 min (liquid peanut butter). After the treatment, the peanut samples were centrifuged and the supernatants analyzed by SDS-PAGE and competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ciELISA). For comparison, boiling treatments were also performed. SDS-PAGE showed that while boiling treatment had little effect on the peanut allergens, PUV-light-treated samples displayed a reduced solubility or level of peanut allergens (63 kDa). Solubility of another allergen (18 to 20 kDa) was unaffected. Insoluble aggregates formed were responsible for the reduced level of allergens in PUV-light-treated samples. ciELISA showed that untreated samples exhibited an IgE binding 7-fold higher than the PUV-treated samples. It was concluded that PUV light was effective in reducing IgE binding of peanut extracts and liquid peanut butter. The current study provides an approach to the development of a possibly less allergenic peanut product. However, the reduction in actual allergenicity needs to be confirmed by clinical studies.",
