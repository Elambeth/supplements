      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (Lf) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with well-established antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and iron-binding properties. Emerging evidence suggests that Lf also plays a neuroprotective role, particularly in neurodegenerative disorders characterized by protein aggregation, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation is a pathological hallmark of PD and other synucleinopathies, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and disease progression. Recent studies indicate that Lf may interfere with aSyn aggregation, iron chelation, and modulation of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Additionally, Lf's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and its potential impact on the gut-brain axis highlight its promise as a therapeutic agent. This review explores Lf's mechanisms of action in synucleinopathies, its potential as a disease-modifying therapy, and innovative delivery strategies that could enhance its clinical applicability. By addressing the pathological and therapeutic dimensions of aSyn aggregation, we propose Lf as a compelling candidate for future research and clinical development in neurodegenerative diseases."

The study examined the production of AgNPs-lactoferrin complexes (AgNPs-LTF) using bovine lactoferrin (LTF) at 1, 2, and 4 mM concentrations. The objective was to create an AgNPs-LTF gel with Carbopol as the base and assess its effectiveness in enhancing wound healing in rats. UV-Vis, PL, FTIR, and XRD analyses confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs. Microscopic examinations (TEM and SEM) showed mainly spherical AgNPs in the AgNPs-LTF samples, with diameters between 11 and 27 nm. The AgNPs-LTF gel with biologically processed AgNPs demonstrated effective infection control and enhanced wound healing outcomes. In Sprague-Dawley rats, the 4 mM AgNPs-LTF gel demonstrated significant wound closure, achieving complete closure by day 10, exceeding the healing rates of both the LTF and control groups. The AgNPs-LTF complex demonstrated high robustness and exceeded the performance of native LTF, exhibiting similar toxicity levels to AgNPs. The study shows the effectiveness of AgNPs-LTF gel in wound treatment, indicating its potential as a viable treatment option.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease, representing a growing public health burden. While previous studies indicated that lactoferrin (LF) alleviates hepatic lipid accumulation, a hallmark of NAFLD, the mechanisms involved are still elusive. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into the control (CON), high-fat, high-cholesterol diet containing cholate (HFCCD), and HFCCD+LF groups and treated for 8 weeks' intervention. Liver and small intestine tissues were analyzed to investigate lipid metabolism and underlying mechanisms. Additionally, gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels were assessed. RESULTS: HFCCD feeding induced hepatic steatosis, while LF intervention improved lipid metabolism by reducing fatty acid synthesis and increasing lipolysis in the liver. Mechanistically, LF downregulated the protein expression of serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A), which is related to lipogenesis, and upregulated the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which is one of the pivotal lipolytic genes, and its downstream effector, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1A (CPT-1A), in the liver. Additionally, LF increased the relative abundance of gut microbiota related to glycolipid metabolism, such as Adlercreutzia, and decreased the relative abundance of 5-HT-promoting gut microbiota, such as Clostridia. Furthermore, LF increased the levels of SCFAs, which positively correlated with the relative abundance of Adlercreutzia. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that LF intervention alleviates HFCCD-induced NAFLD in mice, which is potentially associated with regulation of the HTR2A-PPARa-CPT-1A pathway and gut microbiota composition."

Taken alone, apo-recHLF was less efficient, i.e., the tumor growth index was 0.14 for recHLF-8OA and 0.63 for recHLF as compared with 1.0 in the control animals. In the present study we evaluated antitumor activity of iron-saturated recHLF per se and of the complexes formed by OA with apo-recHLF and holo-recHLF. Balb/c mice with solid myeloma Sp2/0 were subjected to the 10-day treatment with daily intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg iron-saturated recHLF with OA (1:8) per animal (0.4 g/kg). In 15 days, the tumor growth was substantially inhibited. Mean tumor mass was 93% lower as compared with the control value (p < 0.01). I/p injections of apo-recHLF/OA complex did not inhibit the tumor growth. Holo-recHLF used without OA had less pronounced antitumor effect as compared with their complex."

Its biological properties, including antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immune-regulatory, and iron metabolism-regulating functions, have been extensively studied. With further research, lactoferrin's impact on tumorigenesis and tumor microenvironment has become increasingly evident, as it inhibits tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through multiple pathways. This article summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying lactoferrin's anticancer effects, explores its association with the malignant progression of various cancers, and highlights its clinical translational potential as a potential cancer biomarker and drug delivery carrier to enhance anticancer therapy efficiency. Due to the high safety profile of lactoferrin, its widespread application in the field of cancer treatment is highly anticipated."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although advanced surgical techniques are available, satisfactory functional outcomes after peripheral nerve injuries are uncommon. Hence, immune-modulating factors such as PXL01, a lactoferrin-derived peptide that improves axonal outgrowth in injured human digital nerves, have gained attention. We previously reported a short-term immunosuppressive effect of PXL01 after the repair of transected rat sciatic nerves, but it had no effect on nerve regeneration. Here, we investigated the potential of PXL01 to improve nerve regeneration in healthy rats and in a rat model of type 2 diabetes (Goto-Kakizaki [GK] rats). METHODS: A 10-mm sciatic nerve defect was created in healthy (n = 14) and diabetic GK rats (n = 14) and reconstructed using nerve autografts. Immediately after surgery, PXL01 or sodium chloride (control, placebo) (n = 7 for each treatment) was administered around the autograft. On day 8, immunohistochemical staining of the sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was performed to analyze axonal outgrowth (neurofilament staining); inflammation (CD68 and CD206 macrophage staining in nerve); Schwann cell and sensory neuron activation (transcription factor ATF3 staining in nerve and DRGs) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3 staining in nerve); and neuroprotection (heat shock protein [HSP27] staining in nerve and DRGs). RESULTS: PXL01 had no impact on the macrophage response in the autografts but increased axonal outgrowth and HSP27 expression in the DRGs of healthy and diabetic rats, despite a lower number of activated Schwann cells in the autograft. Diabetes affected axonal outgrowth, Schwann cell and macrophage responses, and HSP27 expression. These effects were observed in the sciatic nerve as well as the DRG. DISCUSSION: Application of PXL01, despite having no impact on macrophages, may improve axonal outgrowth and affects Schwann cell activation in autograft-reconstructed sciatic nerves, as well as conveys neuroprotection (HSP27 expression) in the DRGs of healthy and diabetic GK rats. Diabetes influenced nerve regeneration in such autografts. Therefore, PXL01 is a promising candidate to improve nerve regeneration."

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (Lf), we have previously shown, has therapeutic potential in the field of skeletal regenerative medicine demonstrating its potent stimulating effects on bone growth. Recently, we have identified bovine lactoferrin (bLf) as a factor that also enhances antibiotic killing of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Biofilms are associated with around 65% of all infections and 80% of chronic infections. One feature of biofilm infection is tolerance to antibiotics due to the survival of a subpopulation of biofilm bacteria, where laboratory tests on planktonic cells indicate susceptibility. Tolerance is seen in bone infections of osteomyelitis and prosthetic joints, where methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains predominate, but where treatments with the frontline penicillinase-resistant antibiotic cefazolin (CEF) can be ineffective. In vitro-grown biofilms of MSSA are 1000-fold more tolerant to CEF but can be eradicated by CEF at 10x minimal inhibitory concentration in the presence of bLf. Bone infection can impede blood circulation within the bone, leading to bone death. Lf as a potent stimulator of bone growth adds to its appeal as a treatment for bone infections."

In this study, the effect of different doses of LF (L: 50, M: 500 and H: 2000 mg/kg) on D-galactose (D-gal)-induced brain aging C57BL/6 mice was evaluated. The results showed that body weight, mobility, and spatial memory capacity of aging mice were restored after LF (M & H) intervention. It also attenuated hippocampal neuronal damage and intestinal barrier damage in aging mice. LF (M & H) increased brain and serum levels of antioxidant defense enzymes (SOD, GSH, CAT) and decreased colon and serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α). Western blotting results showed that LF (M & H) increased LC3II/I, Beclin1 expression, decreased p-mTOR, p-akt, and p62 expression, and restored autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/m-TOR pathway. Furthermore, LF (M & H) protected the intestinal barrier by regulating the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and increased levels of the beneficial metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Notably, LF (H) exhibited the best anti-aging potential. 500 mg/kg/day LF intervention may be cost-effective in prevents brain aging by regulating the autophagy pathway and the microbiome-gut-brain axis."

While cohort studies demonstrated that specific prebiotics inhibit enteropathogens during iron supplementation, their mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the in vitro impact of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and iron-sequestering bovine lactoferrin (bLF) alone and combined on the gut microbiota of Kenyan infants during low-dose iron supplementation. Methods: Different doses of iron, GOS, and bLF were first screened during batch fermentations (n = 3), and the effect of these factors was studied on microbiota community structure and activity in the new Kenyan infant continuous intestinal PolyFermS model. The impact of different fermentation treatments on barrier integrity, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection, and inflammatory response was assessed using a transwell co-culture of epithelial and immune cells. Results: A dose-dependent increase in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/Pediococcus (LLP) growth was detected with GOS alone and combined with bLF during iron supplementation in batches. This was confirmed in the continuous PolyFermS model, which also showed a treatment-induced inhibition of opportunistic pathogens C. difficile and C. perfringens. In all tests, supplementation of iron alone and combined with bLF did not have a significant effect on microbiota composition and activity. We observed a strengthening of the epithelial barrier and a decrease in cell death and pro-inflammatory response during ETEC infection with microbiota fermentation supernatants from iron + GOS, iron + bLF, and iron + GOS + bLF treatments compared to iron alone. Conclusion: Overall, beneficial effects on infant gut microbiota were shown using advanced in vitro models for GOS alone and combined with bLF during low-dose iron supplementation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bovine mastitis (BM) is a costly disease in the dairy industry. It is associated with reduced milk production and changes in milk composition and quality. Escherichia coli is the most important pathogen causing BM. AIM: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of lactoferrin (LF) as an enhanced agent when combined with marbofloxacin for the treatment of E. coli BM. METHODS: Eighty lactating cattle and buffaloes, 40 each, aged 4-6 years suffering from BM underwent clinical examination. Milk samples were collected for bacteriological examination. The recovered E. coli isolates were subjected to serological, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. BM cases were allocated into two groups: group (A) was treated with marbofloxacin combined with LF, and group (B) was treated with marbofloxacin alone. RESULTS: Fifty E. coli isolates were recovered. Six serogroup were identified: O55, O103, O26, O11, O44, and O124. All isolates were sensitive to marbofloxacin, while there was resistance to gentamycin and ampicillin (26% each), cefquinome (14%), cefixime (10%), and SuLFamethoxazole and trimethoprim (4%). The molecular identification of E. coli strains revealed that the 16S rRNA gene was present in all identified E. coli strains (100%). All isolates resistant to antibiotics encoded BlaTEM, aadB, and Sul1, whereas the qnrS gene was not detected in any E. coli isolate. The broth dilution method did not detect growth when the marbofloxacin (6 μg/ml) was combined with LF (2 mg/ml). Group (A) showed significant improvements compared with group (B), with no recurrence rate. CONCLUSION: LF can serve as a significant cotreatment agent for treating BM. As antibiotic resistance increases, LF-based drugs could play an important role in providing sustainable, effective alternatives for dairy animals.",

Within the array of diverse cancers, breast cancer arises as one of the primary contributors to cancer-related fatalities in females. Breast cysts, thickenings, alterations in breast size or form, etc., are all prevalent and well-known signs of breast cancer. Despite remarkable progression in cancer research and the abundance of potent drugs, the effectiveness of conventional therapy is still hindered by various complications. In this avenue, nanocarriers present considerable promise for delivering therapeutics to cancerous cells, however, still numerous challenges persist in achieving successful targeted drug delivery and localization. Recent progress has emphasized the utilization of ligand-functionalized nanocarriers to enhance the delivery at target tissues and improve uptake by cancer cells. This approach contributes to increased accuracy and efficacy, which ultimately leads to enhanced patient outcomes. Lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein, is currently receiving significant attention as a promising ligand for targeted drug delivery in cancerous cells, especially breast cancer cells. This review provides new insight into ligand-targeted therapy, emphasizing the key benefits and notable features of utilizing lactoferrin as a targeting ligand for delivering drug-loaded nanocarriers to tumor sites."

In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing new cancer therapies, including nutraceuticals and natural compounds with anticancer properties. Lactoferrin, a glycoprotein present in mammals, is of significant interest due to its pleiotropic behavior, demonstrating a broad spectrum of biological activities such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anticancer effects. In this review, we examine the current knowledge of Lf's role in cancer. In addition, it exhibits a synergistic effect along with conventional drugs, potentially enhancing their efficacy and, at the same time, reducing the side effects associated with most traditional therapies. However, it is essential to consider the precise molecular mechanism by which Lf exerts its antitumor activity. Searching interactions with several molecules can provide insight into this mechanism. Additionally, finding lactoferrin receptors can improve the strategies for the specific release of the conjugates. For all these reasons, Lactoferrin becomes a potential therapeutic agent that should be examined in depth.",

Our findings demonstrate that SP-LF hybrid hydrolysates had effective 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and iron ion reducing ability. The synergistic effect between these hybrid hydrolysates were found to be superior to the single hydrolysate in terms of antioxidant level by the joint index analysis. These hybrid hydrolysates are characterized by high levels of amino acids with potential anti-fatigue effect: tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe), hydrophobic amino acid (HAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). In murine models, hybrid hydrolysates significantly prolonged weight-bearing swimming time, increased muscle/liver glycogen levels, decreased lactate, urea nitrogen, and malondialdehyde levels, and increased glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and ATPase activities. Pearson's correlation analysis established significant associations between antioxidant capacity and anti-fatigue efficacy. It alleviated fatigue through activating the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, while increasing the expression levels of PGC-1α. These results collectively suggest that SP-LF hybrid hydrolysates demonstrate significant synergistic antioxidant and anti-fatigue activity and could be incorporated into functional foods as a dietary supplement to reduce fatigue."

      "abstract": "Objective: Lactoferrin, a glycoprotein, has known neuroprotective effects, yet its role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia, remains unclear. This study aims to assess changes in lactoferrin levels during different phases of schizophrenia and explore its relationship with cognitive symptoms and performance. Method : This before/after interventional study involved 30 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Participants were evaluated at two time points: upon hospital admission and after the resolution of acute symptoms. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was utilized to measure symptom severity, while the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) assessed the neurocognitive function. Serum lactoferrin levels were quantified using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Results: Serum lactoferrin levels significantly decreased from 130.63 ± 52.49 ng/mL at admission to 85.42 ± 29.03 ng/mL at discharge (P < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between lactoferrin levels and PANSS scores (r = 0.011, P = 0.975). However, an inverse correlation was observed between changes in lactoferrin levels and the executive function subscale of the BACS (r = -0.360, P = 0.050). Cognitive assessments indicated significant improvements in verbal memory (P = 0.033), working memory (P = 0.002), and executive function (P = 0.039) post-treatment. Conclusion: The study demonstrates a significant reduction in serum lactoferrin levels during the acute phase of schizophrenia, suggesting its potential role in modulating cognitive functions, particularly the executive function, rather than influencing positive or negative symptoms."

Diosmetin, a natural flavonoid, has known neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models but has been less studied in ICH. Our previous study developed diosmetin-loaded lactoferrin-modified long-circulating liposomes (Lf-Dios-Lcl), which penetrate the BBB and improve diosmetin bioavailability and brain distribution. In this study, we found that diosmetin reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and increased the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in LPS-induced BV2 cells, promoting microglial polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. In ICH model rats, Lf-Dios-Lcl (1 mg/kg) effectively reduced neuroinflammation, decreased IL-1β and TNF-α levels, increased IL-10 levels, and increased the proportion of CD206-positive microglia in brain tissues. Moreover, Lf-Dios-Lcl significantly downregulated p-p38 expression, suggesting that p38 signaling activation was inhibited. Overall, Lf-Dios-Lcl demonstrated brain-targeting properties and antineuroinflammatory effects by modulating microglial polarization via the p38 pathway."

The expression levels of lactoferrin and HIF-1α in tears of DED patients and normal controls were detected. A DED mouse model received lactoferrin (50 mg/kg dissolved in 2 mL PBS) or DMOG (40 mg/kg dissolved in 2 mL PBS) orally daily for 28 days. DMOG (dimethyloxaloylglycine) is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor. Various tests conducted in this study were phenol red thread test, corneal fluorescein sodium staining, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, PAS staining of conjunctiva, TUNEL staining, and Western blotting. Compared to normal controls, DED patients showed significantly decreased expression of lactoferrin and increased expression of HIF-1α in tears (P < 0.05). Compared to normal mice, DED model mice exhibited significantly decreased tear secretion, goblet cell count, Bcl-2, lactoferrin, and STAT3 protein expression levels, and significantly increased corneal fluorescein sodium staining grade, TUNEL positivity rate, Bax, HIF-1α, p21, and p27 protein expression levels (P < 0.05). Treatment with lactoferrin or DMOG significantly increased tear secretion, goblet cell count, Bcl-2, lactoferrin, HIF-1α, and STAT3 protein expression levels, and significantly decreased corneal fluorescein sodium staining grade, TUNEL positivity rate, Bax, p21, and p27 protein expression levels in DED model mice (P < 0.05). Normal mice showed normal corneal morphology. Compared to normal mice, DED model mice exhibited rough surface of corneal epithelial cell layer with vacuolated cells and inflammatory cell infiltration. Treatment with lactoferrin or DMOG significantly alleviated corneal lesions in DED model mice. Lactoferrin and HIF-1α exert protective effects on DED in mice."

The docking results highlight XIAP (X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) and Caspase-3 as the most reliable targets, where hLf disrupts XIAP's inhibition of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9, potentially restoring apoptotic signaling; hLf also stabilizes Caspase-3, enhancing its activation in intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Weaker interactions were observed with Fas, Bcl-2, and Akt. hLf's role in Fas signaling is likely due to expression upregulation rather than direct binding. In contrast, its binding to Bcl-2 may disrupt anti-apoptotic function, and its interaction with Akt suggests interference with pro-survival signaling. These findings suggest that hLf may promote apoptosis by enhancing caspase activation and modulating key apoptotic regulators, supporting its potential use in cancer treatment. However, further experimental validation is needed to confirm these interactions and their therapeutic implications.",

However, the effectiveness of oral Lactoferrin is limited by its susceptibility to degradation in harsh stomach conditions, reducing its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. To address this challenge, this study employs Chitosan/Alginate microparticles to enhance Lactoferrin stability and antibacterial activity. Microparticles were synthesized through external ionic gelation and thoroughly characterized. Chitosan/Alginate microparticles were significantly smaller than Alginate microparticles, with a high loading efficiency of 93.65 %. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy confirmed the successful incorporation of Lactoferrin. Release studies demonstrated minimal Lactoferrin release in simulated gastric fluid, while a controlled release was observed in simulated intestinal fluid. Notably encapsulated Lactoferrin retained its structural integrity after exposure to simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Antibacterial assay against Escherichia coli showed that Chitosan/Alginate microcapsules maintain Lactoferrin antibacterial activity after its passage through simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Furthermore, FT-IR spectroscopy and zeta-potential analysis provided novel insights into the mechanism of Lactoferrin's interaction with bacterial LPS, highlighting its ability to destabilize bacterial membrane of this Escherichia coli strain. These findings underscore the Chitosan/Alginate system as a promising strategy for enhancing the therapeutic potential of Lactoferrin."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by oxidative stress and dopaminergic neuron damage. While levodopa remains the cornerstone of PD treatment, its efficacy is limited by poor bioavailability and neuroprotective effects. Curcumin, a potent antioxidant derived from turmeric, demonstrates neuroprotective promise but also suffers from low bioavailability, hindering its therapeutic application. The combined therapeutic use of levodopa and curcumin offers a potential synergistic approach, though its neuroprotection potential through brain-targeted delivery remains underexplored. PURPOSE: To develop a lactoferrin-modified organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous silica nanoparticle system (Lf-lip@LC-MSNs) for co-delivering levodopa and curcumin, aiming to enhance neuroprotective efficacy and achieve brain-targeted delivery in PD. METHODS: Lf-lip@LC-MSNs were engineered to encapsulate levodopa within a curcumin-loaded lipid bilayer, modified with lactoferrin for optimized brain-targeted delivery. In vitro studies were conducted on rotenone-damaged neuronal models to evaluate oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, and neuronal survival. In vivo experiments on MPTP-induced PD mouse models evaluated biodistribution, therapeutic efficacy, and safety in healthy mice, focusing on motor function recovery. RESULTS: The combination of levodopa and curcumin significantly reduced oxidative stress and α-synuclein accumulation, enhancing neuronal survival compared to monotherapies. Lf-lip@LC-MSNs further amplified these effects, achieving superior brain-targeted delivery and improved motor function restoration with minimal systemic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of curcumin and levodopa provided synergistic neuroprotection in PD models. By employing a targeted delivery system, the Lf-lip@LC-MSNs not only facilitated efficient brain targeting but also potentiated therapeutic outcomes, providing a compelling strategy for treating PD and paving the way for advancements in managing other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Although LF has anticancer effects, to the best of our knowledge, its effects on multiple myeloma have not yet been studied. We explored the potential of a lactoferrin-derived chimera for multiple myeloma treatment, a malignant clonal plasma cell bone marrow disease. The lactoferrin-derived chimera effectively inhibited MM1S, MM1R, and RPMI8226 multiple myeloma cell growth, and induced the early and late phases of apoptosis, but not in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, the lactoferrin-derived chimera modulates the relative expression of genes involved in survival, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction at the transcriptional level. Mitochondrial analysis revealed that lactoferrin-derived chimera triggered oxidative stress in multiple myeloma cells, leading to reactive oxygen species generation and a decline in mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Although lactoferrin-derived chimera did not cause caspase-dependent cell death, it induced nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G, indicating the initiation of caspase-independent apoptosis. Overall, the lactoferrin-derived chimera induces caspase-independent programmed cell death in multiple myeloma cell lines by increasing the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor/endonuclease G. Therefore, it has potential for multiple myeloma cancer therapies.",

This is a 62-year-old patient with hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis treated with Bonames®. After extraction, she presented exposed bone in the alveolar ridge of quadrant III. Under informed consent, minimally invasive surgery was performed with electrical instruments (Piezotome®). Histopathological analysis revealed necrotic bone tissue with chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The treatment included Blue®M teeth&bone once a day for 30 days, topical application of Blue®M gel every morning for 15 days and FBM with 808nm diode laser (Therapy-DMC®). The laser sessions were daily until day 3, and then twice a week for four weeks. The patient also performed mouthwashes with Blue®M every night for 30 days. Initially, the patient reported pain of 3/10 on the visual analog scale, which decreased to 0/10 at the end of treatment. Clinically, soft tissue healing was observed at 30 days and 60 days and the CT scan showed hyperdense cancellous bone with well-formed cortical and no alterations. Finally, this case suggests that the combination of FBM with topical active oxygen therapy and lactoferrin, along with minimally invasive surgical intervention, holds promise for the management of MRONJ."

Steroid hormones are essential for development and lactation in the dairy cow mammary gland, and act through binding to receptors that drive gene transcription. However, it remains unclear whether steroid hormone receptors play roles in LF synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). In this study, we investigated the direct effects of estrogen and glucocorticoid on LF synthesis and secretion by BMECs. The results show that treatment of BMECs with estrogen (17-β-estradiol, E2) and glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone) significantly promoted cell proliferation. Furthermore, E2 or hydrocortisone increased the expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and stimulated the synthesis and secretion of LF in BMECs. Treatment of BMECs with various inhibitors (fulvestrant, mifepristone, and pimozide) decreased LF gene transcript and LF protein levels. It was concluded that fulvestrant and mifepristone inhibit LF transcription and translation via inhibiting ER and GR, respectively. Our data indicate that E2 and hydrocortisone regulate LF protein synthesis through the ER and GR signaling pathways. These results provide new information about the regulation of the synthesis of functional proteins in milk."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: India is impacted by the increasing burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), necessitating efficient management and therapy. CKD is characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, specifically IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-6, TNF-α, TGF-β, and fibrinogen. The aim of this research is to determine the antiinflammatory effects of lactoferrin + disodium guanosine monophosphate therapy in CKD patients. The objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of this therapy versus conservative CKD management alone in reducing inflammation. This study intends to examine the possible benefits of study drug in treating inflammation associated with CKD by analyzing its effect on inflammatory markers including IL-6 and TNF-α. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, parallel group, two-arm clinical study, comprising of 40 patients with CKD, with 20 patients in each group. The groups were well-matched in terms of demographic characteristics. Conception, screening, randomization, and follow-up visits including physical examinations, laboratory investigations, and medication dispensation were all carried out over a 29-week period. Creatinine clearance, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), estimated urine urea nitrogen, and inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, CRP) were analyzed at time of screening and at 3 and 6-month postrandomization. RESULTS: The study found a significant decrease in inflammatory markers, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10, in the group receiving study drug, indicating its potential as an antiinflammatory intervention for managing CKD. Secondary endpoints, including hemoglobin (Hb) and e-GFR levels, showed nonsignificant improvements in the study group compared to the control group. No significant adverse events were reported during the study. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the potential antiinflammatory effects of the lactoferrin + disodium guanosine monophosphate therapy in individuals with CKD. The findings suggest that study drug may be a viable intervention for managing inflammation in CKD patients. Further research is needed to validate these results and explore its long-term effects in CKD management.",

      "abstract": "Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) plays a crucial role in cancer cell metabolism by regulating the glycolytic pathway. Although, inhibitors targeting PDK1 have been effective in inhibiting glycolysis in multiple cancers, their lack of selectivity leading to off-target effects limit their therapeutic benefit. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory potential of six PDK1 inhibitors on cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion of androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-negative PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Of the six PDK1 inhibitors, radicicol and dicumarol significantly inhibited cellular proliferation and exhibited lower metabolic activity in both LNCaP and PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer cells. Radicicol was highly effective at lower concentration. Moreover, radicicol significantly inhibited migration and invasion in PC-3 cells. We then developed a lactoferrin nanoparticle (LF-NP) encapsulated with Radicicol (Ra-LF-NP), using a rotary evaporation method. Spheroid assays confirmed the higher inhibitory potential of Ra-LF-NP with a reduction in spheroid area by 80%, and invasiveness compared to radicicol alone. Lactoferrin receptors are overexpressed on the surface of many cancer cells, including prostate cancer. Conjugating radicicol with lactoferrin nanoparticles, potentially enhanced the specific uptake of the drug by prostate cancer cells while minimizing the off-target effects on healthy cells. This targeted therapy approach could lead to improved treatment outcomes and reduced side effects. Our study demonstrated the potential of radicicol delivery by lactoferrin-conjugated nanoparticle as an efficient drug delivery strategy for prostate cancer treatment.",

Calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles with immobilized lactoferrin could therefore be useful as intraoral disinfectants for the prevention and treatment of dental infections because CaP is a mineral component of human teeth. In this study, we fabricated CaP nanoparticles with co-immobilized lactoferrin and heparin using a simple one-step coprecipitation process. Heparin, a negatively charged polysaccharide, was used as both an immobilizing agent for lactoferrin and a particle-dispersing agent. The immobilization efficiency for lactoferrin in the CaP nanoparticles depended on the concentrations of both the lactoferrin and heparin in the reaction solution and was over 90% under optimal conditions. The nanoparticles had a hydrodynamic diameter of about 150-200 nm and could be well dispersed in water, owing to their relatively large negative zeta potential derived from heparin. They were found to exhibit antibacterial activity against Actinomyces naeslundii, which is involved in the initial formation of dental plaque that consequently leads to dental caries and periodontal disease. These results indicate the potential of the proposed nanoparticles as intraoral disinfectants.",

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein of the transferrin family and has been suggested to have a variety of biological functions, including anticancer activity. However, the effects of LF and its mechanisms in anticancer therapies, especially in radiotherapy against cancer cells under hypoxic conditions, are not well-determined. In this study, we focused on the molecular mechanisms of LF functions in cells under hypoxic conditions. High-dose LF treatment showed cytotoxic activity in a variety of cells, including both non-cancer and cancer cells. Interestingly, hypoxic treatment increased the sensitivity to LF in some cancer cells but decreased it in non-cancer cells. LF treatment also altered sensitivity to radiation treatment: LF significantly increased the viability of irradiated KD non-cancer cells under hypoxic conditions but decreased that of HSC2 cancer cells. These effects were only observed when LF was treated within 3 h of irradiation, but not before irradiation. Importantly, knockdown of HIF1A counteracted these effects in both cell lines. Measurements of ROS activity showed that LF decreased ROS production in KD cells but increased it in HSC2 cells, resulting in a decrease in γH2AX foci in KD cells but an increase in HSC2 cells. RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analysis showed that LF treatment regulated gene expression related to the cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammation, and the NRF2 antioxidant signaling pathway. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the downregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene ASC in KD cells and the NRF2-regulated genes in HSC2 cells by LF treatment. Knockdown experiments confirmed the role of ASC in irradiated KD cells and NRF2 in irradiated HSC2 cells with LF treatment. In conclusion, lactoferrin was shown to affect radiation treatment by regulating apoptosis and NRF2 signaling in a cell type-specific manner under hypoxic conditions, suggesting its potential application as a protector or sensitizer for radiation therapy."

      "abstract": "Norcantharidin (NCTD), an antitumor agent with an increased leukocyte function, has been used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in clinical. However, the clinical application of NCTD is limited due to its inadequate hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, short half-life (t1/2), as well as adverse effects such as vascular irritation, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Herein, a lactoferrin (Lf) and DSPE-mPEG2000 functionalized liposomes loaded with norcantharidic acid (NCA), an active metabolite of NCTD, was constructed for the targeted therapy of HCC. In this study, blank PEGylated liposomes were prepared using the film hydration method, and the NCA was loaded by calcium acetate active loading method to increase the encapsulation efficiency (EE). Subsequently, lactoferrin was covalently coupled to DSPE-PEG2000-COOH activated by EDC and NHS. In addition, the in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and H22 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice, respectively. As expected, the encapsulation efficiency measurement showed that the encapsulation efficiency of the NCA liposomes was 89.3±1.25 %, and the coupling efficiency of lactoferrin was more than 65.97 %. Additionally, the variations in both the dynamic size and encapsulation efficiency of norcantharidic acid liposomes in long-term storage stability and serum stability studies did not exceed 10 %. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics results showed that, the NCA-Lips-Lf were able to significantly improve antitumor activity by enhancing tumor-targeting accumulation and prolonging circulation time in the body compared to the sodium demethylcantharidate for injection (Na2DCA). Notably, the AUC0-48 and the t1/2 of NCA-Lips-Lf increased 4.28-time and 5.17-time in comparison to those of NCA-sol, respectively. The tumor inhibition rate of NCA-Lips-Lf (85.29 %) was significantly higher than that of sodium demethylcantharidate for injection (Na2DCA) (59.13 %), without obvious vascular irritation, cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In conclusion, NCA-Lips-Lf have the potential to eliminate hepatocellular carcinoma more effectively with fewer side effects than Na2DCA, which further advances the clinical application of norcantharidin-related drugs.",

Lactoferrin (LF) supplementation has the potential to reduce infection-related morbidity due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of oral LF supplementation randomized controlled trials in population under 18 years old. The primary outcomes were infection-associated outcomes: late onset sepsis (LOS), diarrhea, and upper respiratory infections (URIs). We also analyzed mortality among LOS studies. Of 1594 citations identified, 25 studies met eligibility criteria, including 10 studies of LOS, 14 of diarrhea, and 8 of URI. LF supplementation was associated with fewer patients with culture-proven or probable neonatal LOS compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR): 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42-0.86), with fewer patients with diarrhea compared to placebo in children (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.41-0.75), and no significant fewer patients with URI (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.27-1.40). Before LF can be used as a public health intervention, it is necessary to refine some aspects of the design of future trials. Ideally these trials should be conducted in countries with the highest burden of infections, where the potential benefit is expected to have the largest impact.",

We aimed to investigate the changes in tear cytokine and lactoferrin levels in postmenopausal women with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO) complicated with obstructed meibomian gland dysfunction (OMGD) and preliminary explore the pathological mechanisms of OMGD in patients with PANDO. METHODS: The prospective study involved 43 and 41 postmenopausal women with and without PANDO, respectively. Based on the presence or absence of OMGD, the participants were subdivided. Tear fluid was collected from affected eyes of all participants using Schirmer I test and tested for cytokine concentrations (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, interferon-gamma, tumour necrotic factor (TNF)-α, IL-10, epidermal growth factor (EGF)) using the Multiplex Luminex Assay. Tear lactoferrin levels was determined using ELISA. RESULTS: In the PANDO with OMGD group, the IL-8, IL-1α, IL-1β, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α levels were significantly higher than those in the other groups. The IL-6 and TNF-α levels were significantly higher than those in the controls. The lactoferrin level in the PANDO with OMGD group was lower than that in the Non-PANDO with OMGD group. The IL-10 and EGF levels were not significantly different among the groups. CONCLUSION: The level of pro-inflammatory factors in the tears of patients with PANDO complicated with OMGD was significantly increased, which is likely to cause further damage to ocular surface. Anti-inflammatory therapy may help protect ocular surface in postmenopausal women with PANDO.",

This protein has shown its capability to bind and transport iron molecules in the vicinity of the host-pathogen environment. The ability of parasites to sequester the iron molecule and to increase their pathogenicity and survival depends on the availability of iron sources. Lf protein has suggested a iron chelating effect on parasites iron and, hence, has shown its antiparasitic effect. Since the parasites have a complex life cycle and have developed drug resistance, vaccines and other treatments are a handful. Therefore, therapeutic research focusing on natural treatment regimens that target the parasite and are non-toxic to host cells is urgently needed. The antiparasitic efficacy of Lf protein has been extensively studied over the past 40 years using both in vitro and in vivo studies. This review article highlighted past important studies on Lf protein that revealed its potential antiparasitic activity against various intracellular and extracellular intestinal or blood-borne human parasites. This review article structures the role of Lf protein in its various forms, such as native, peptide, and nanoformulation, laying the groundwork for its function as an antiparasitic agent and its possible known mechanisms of action."

In this study, we developed a nanoemulsion of the lactoferrin (LTF)-EPA complex and conducted a thorough investigation of its macro- and molecular properties. By characterizing the emulsion with different LTF concentrations, we found that 1.0% LTF formed the most stable complex with EPA, which benefited the formation and stability of the emulsion against storage and freezing/thawing treatment. As the foundation block of the emulsion structure, the binding mechanism and the entire dynamic reaction process of the complex have been fully revealed through various molecular simulations and theoretical calculations. This study establishes a comprehensive picture of the LTF-EPA complex across multiple length scales, providing new insights for further applications and productions of its emulsion."

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons and persistent inflammation. Neurons are terminally differentiated cells, and lost neurons cannot be replaced since neurogenesis is restricted to only two neurogenic niches in the adult brain, whose neurogenic potential decreases with age. In this regard, the astrocytes reprogramming into neurons may represent a promising strategy for restoring the lost neurons and rebuilding neural circuits. To date, many anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation; however, their potential to restore neuronal loss was poorly investigated. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of lactoferrin on DI-TNC1 astrocyte cell line and its ability to induce astrocyte reprogramming in a context of sustained inflammation. For this purpose, astrocytes were pre-treated with lactoferrin (4 μg/mL) for 24 h, then with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (400 ng/mL), and examined 2, 9 and 16 days from treatment. The results demonstrate that lactoferrin attenuates astrocyte reactivity by reducing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and IL-6 expression, as well as by upregulating Interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine and NRF2 expression. Moreover, lactoferrin promotes the reprogramming of reactive astrocytes into proliferative neuroblasts by inducing the overexpression of the Sex determining region Y/SRY-box 2 (SOX2) reprogramming transcription factor. Overall, this study highlights the potential effects of lactoferrin to attenuate neuroinflammation and improve neurogenesis, suggesting a future strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes 90% of liver cancer cases and ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating urgent development of alternative therapies. Lactoferrin (LF), a natural iron-binding glycoprotein with reported anticancer effects, is investigated for its potential in liver cancer treatment, an area with limited existing studies. This study focuses on evaluating LF's anti-liver cancer effects on HCC cells and assessing the preventive efficacy of oral LF administration in a murine model. Data showed that LF exerted anti-proliferative effects on HepG2, Hep3B, and SK-Hep1 cells while having no cytotoxicity on healthy liver cells (FL83B). Mechanistically, LF induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells, associated with increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK for apoptosis, and ERK phosphorylation for cell cycle arrest. Intelectin-1 (INTL1) is identified as the receptor facilitating LF endocytosis in HepG2 cells, and downregulation of INTL1 inhibits LF-induced signaling pathways. Notably, oral LF administration prevents HCC development in nude mice with orthotopic HepG2 cell injection. This study unveils the mechanistic basis of LF action in HepG2 cells, showcasing its potential in HCC prevention. Importantly, we report the novel identification of INTL1 as the LF receptor in HepG2 cells, providing valuable insights for future exploration of LF and its derivatives in liver cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Oral formulation is the ideal treatment method for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapy, but the mucosal damage and diarrhea symptoms impede the drug retention around the inflammatory region, severely limiting IBD therapeutic efficacy. To address this, an oral astaxanthin (Ast) precise delivery formulation is developed with the selective Ast anchoring around the inflammatory region by the novel lactoferrin (LF)-responsive flocculation. This formulation also heightens the apparent solubility of Ast with the minimized edible safety risks for the edible raw materials. For in vivo IBD therapy, the precise delivery formulation exhibits remarkable outcomes, including a significant increase in colon length and a 100% survival rate. Furthermore, it is verified that the mechanism of treatment is primarily attributed to the improved immunoregulation, epithelial repair, and gut microbiota remodeling after the LF-responsive flocculation. This effective inflammatory-responsive delivery design is instructive and valuable to develop more precise delivery systems for IBD therapy.",

Intranasal delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier for improved drug bioavailability, yet narrow nasal space and brief retention time hinder clinical applicability. We conducted a Bromocriptine Mesylate-loaded PLGA nanoparticles co-modified with low molecular weight protamine (LMWP) and lactoferrin (Lf) (LMWP/Lf-BCM-NPs) for nose-to-brain delivery. The resulting LMWP/Lf-BCM-NPs were uniform spheres with an average size of 248.53 ± 16.25 nm and zeta potential of -2.63 ± 0.74 mV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed LMWP and Lf attachment. The co-modified nanoparticles showed improving cellular transport and good viability. The LMWP/Lf-BCM-NPs showed increased brain targeting efficiency in mice. In haloperidol-induced Parkinson mouse models, the LMWP/Lf-BCM-NPs showed increased brain targeting efficiency, enhanced behavioral regulatory effects, enhanced antioxidant effects and neuroprotection effects.

      "abstract": "Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) infections result in significant economic losses and reduced animal welfare. Historically, antibiotics and vaccinations currently control APEC infections in poultry, however, antibiotic-resistant strains and heterologous serotypes limit their effectiveness. Meanwhile, antibiotic-resistant strains can be transmitted to humans via contact with animals, food or their environment. Probiotics and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are potential alternatives to antibiotics and represent promising strategies to combat APEC. Bovine lactoferricin and lactoferrampin possess anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is an excellent vector for delivering recombinant proteins. In this research, we generated a recombinant L. lactis strain MG1363 expressing lactoferrin peptides, which was labeled with a fluorescent marker mCherry and lacked an antibiotic resistance gene (LL-EFLmC). Our investigation focused on the impact of LL-EFLmC strain on the gut microbiota composition and avian pathogenic E. coli O78 challenge. Our findings indicate that LL-EFLmC exhibits inhibitory effects against APEC-O78 and Staphylococcus aureus CVCC26003 (S. aureus CVCC26003) in vitro. Furthermore, the inclusion of LL-EFLmC in chicken feed significantly improved the average daily intake and gain to feed ratio. Additionally, LL-EFLmC treatment resulted in a significant increase in serum IgG and intestinal mucus SIgA levels. Administration of LL-EFLmC was found to effectively suppress APEC-O78 infection and mitigate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Additionally, 16S rDNA sequencing data revealed that LL-EFLmC was able to restore the intestinal flora that had been disrupted by APEC-O78. These findings suggest that LL-EFLmC may serve as a promising feed additive and antibiotic alternative in chicken production, due to its potential to enhance immune regulation, promote growth, and confer resistance against APEC-O78 infection.",

This narrative review explores the current understanding of Lf's role in cancer, focusing on the endogenously expressed human full-length and ΔLf isoforms, and the effects of treatment with exogenous human and bovine Lf. We evaluated and compared the mechanisms by which Lf influences tumorigenesis and cancer progression, focusing on its impact on key processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell migration, and invasiveness. Notably, the mechanisms of action of human and bovine Lf show some divergences, presumably due to slight structural differences that may lead to opposing effects. Insights from this comparison may help identify new Lf variants with enhanced anticancer activity. Indeed, both human and bovine Lf showed substantial anticancer activity, prompting researchers to investigate their potential utility in cancer prevention and progression. However, some studies have indicated that high levels of human Lf expression may be linked to increased carcinogenesis and metastasis, reflecting its intricate and context-dependent role in cancer. Thus, we emphasize the need for a deeper comprehension of Lf biology and its regulation to enhance understanding of Lf's role in cancer and identify more targeted therapeutic strategies, encouraging further research in this area.",

      "abstract": "Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, presents a formidable challenge in terms of treatment due to its propensity for metastasis and resistance to conventional therapies. The development of innovative nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery has opened new avenues in cancer therapy. Lactoferrin-conjugated extracellular nanovesicles (LF-EVs) have emerged as a promising vehicle in the targeted treatment of cellular melanoma, owing to their natural biocompatibility, enhanced bioavailability, and ability to traverse biological barriers effectively. This review synthesizes recent advancements in the use of LF-EVs as a novel drug delivery system for melanoma, emphasizing their unique capacity to enhance cellular uptake through LF's receptor-mediated endocytosis pathways. Key studies demonstrate that LF conjugation significantly increases the specificity of extracellular nanovesicles for melanoma cells, minimizes off-target effects, and promotes efficient intracellular drug release. Furthermore, we explore how LF-EVs interact with the tumor microenvironment, potentially inhibiting melanoma progression and metastasis while supporting antitumor immune responses. Future prospects in this field include optimizing LF conjugation techniques, improving the scalability of LF-EV production, and integrating multifunctional payloads to target drug resistance mechanisms. This review highlights the potential of LF-EVs to transform melanoma treatment strategies, bridging current gaps in therapeutic delivery and paving the way for personalized and less invasive melanoma therapies.",

The nanoparticles were characterized by an average size of 208.7 ± 1.25 nm, a zeta potential of 30.77 ± 1.21 mV, and 82.45 % drug encapsulation efficiency. In vitro drug release studies showed sustained, pH-responsive release, with 98.68 ± 4.12 % released at pH 5.5 over 24 h. The nanoparticles exhibited significant cytotoxicity in HCT116 cells (IC50 = 15.32 μg/mL), inducing ROS generation, apoptosis, and G2/M cell cycle arrest, with notable downregulation of BCL2 gene expression. Enhanced cellular uptake due to lactoferrin targeting improved therapeutic efficacy. In In vivo studies, the nanoparticles demonstrated significant tumor reduction and selective colon accumulation in a DMH-induced colorectal cancer rat model, along with improved pharmacokinetics, showing extended plasma circulation and bioavailability compared to free etoposide. Biocompatibility assays, including hemolysis (<1 %), platelet aggregation, and HET-CAM tests, confirmed the safety profiling of the prepared nanoparticles. The nanoparticles also inhibited Proteus mirabilis (ZOI = 1.9 cm) and exhibited promising effects on the gut microbiome of treated animals.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Despite advancements in cancer therapeutics, effective treatments with minimal side effects remain elusive. Natural sources, such as camel milk, harbor bioactive compounds such as lactoferrin peptides, which hold promise as anticancer agents. This study investigated the potential of camel milk-derived lactoferrin peptides against breast cancer cells through a combined in silico and in vitro approach. By integrating computational modeling with experimental assays, we aimed to elucidate the anticancer mechanisms of these peptides and provide insights for their optimization as anticancer therapeutics. METHODS: In silico analysis involving pepetid design, and validation, then molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was used to explore peptide-protein interactions and stability. Peptides were synthesized and tested for anticancer activity using MTT assays on MCF-7 cells, with HDFa normal cells used as controls. RESULTS: Results of this study showed that camel milk-derived lactoferrin peptides, particularly PEP66, exhibited strong anticancer activity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with the lowest IC50 value (52.82 μg/mL) compared to other peptides. In silico molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed that PEP66 formed stable interactions with key residues in the HER2 catalytic site, indicating its potential as an effective anticancer agent. The selectivity index (SI) of PEP66 (3.19) also suggested lower toxicity to normal cells compared to cancer cells, reinforcing its therapeutic potential. Hydrogen bonding analysis highlighted key residues involved in stabilizing peptide-protein complexes, while molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of these interactions over time. Notably, PEP66 exhibited the highest stability and formed significant interactions with essential residues in the HER2 catalytic site, suggesting its potential as an effective anticancer agent. CONCLUSION: Camel milk-derived lactoferrin peptides show promise as anticancer agents against breast cancer cells. The multidisciplinary approach employed in this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying their activity, paving the way for rational design strategies to enhance their efficacy. Further experimental validation is warranted to validate the anticancer potential of these peptides and advance their development as novel therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment."

Lactoferrin, a crucial functional dietary component obtainable from food sources, primarily exists in mammalian milk. We aim to investigate whether dietary supplementation with lactoferrin can protect the thyroid in Experimental Autoimmune Thyroiditis (EAT) rats. Our study reveals significantly elevated levels of oxidative stress (OS) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in the AITD. Lactoferrin markedly reduces OS and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the thyroid tissue of EAT rats. Furthermore, lactoferrin inhibits ERS levels in the thyroid of EAT rats and alleviates cellular apoptosis. In vivo and in vitro experiments elucidate that its protective effect is primarily achieved through the inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway activation. In summary, lactoferrin, a nutrient readily obtainable from food sources, appears to be effective in mitigating thyroid damage in AITD.",

The vehicle control group received sodium citrate buffer, test groups received daily doses of 200, 600, and 2000 mg of effera™ per kg body weight, and the comparative control group received 2000 mg bovine LF (bLF)/kg body weight per day. T-cell-dependent antibody response against keyhole limpet hemocyanin and immunophenotyping of the spleen were performed as measures of immunotoxicity. Clinical observations, body weight, hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, immunotoxicity, gross necropsy, and histopathology were assessed. Toxicokinetic parameters were analyzed as an indication of LF bioavailability, and anti-LF antibody assays were conducted to detect antibodies produced against LF to measure immunogenicity. No treatment related toxicologically significant changes were observed. Based on the absence of toxicologically relevant changes, effera™ is well tolerated in rats at doses up to 2000 mg rhLF/kg/day, an amount ∼400 times that of the estimated daily intake at the 90th percentile proposed for human adult use.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lactoferrin (Lf) is an important immunomodulator in infections caused by different agents. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, Lf can hinder or prevent virus access to the intracellular environment. Severe cases of COVID-19 are related to increased production of cytokines, accompanied by a weak type 1 interferon response. METHODS: We investigated the influence of bovine Lf (bLf) in the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo assays. RESULTS: Our results show a strong binding between bLf and TLR4/NF-κB in silico, as well as an increase in mRNA expression of these genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with bLf. Furthermore, the treatment increased TLR4/TLR9 mRNA expression in infected K18-hACE2 mouse blood, indicating an activation of innate response. Our results show that, when bLf was added, a reduction in the NK cell population was found, presenting a similar effect on PD-1 in TCD4+ and TCD8+ cells. In the culture supernatant of PBMCs from healthy participants, bLf decreased IL-6 levels and increased CCL5 in COVID-19 participants. In addition, K18-hACE2 mice infected and treated with bLf presented an increase of serum pro-inflammatory markers (GM-CSF/IL-1β/IL-2) and upregulated mRNA expression of IL1B and IL6 in the lung tissue. Furthermore, bLf treatment was able to restore FTH1 levels in brain tissue. DISCUSSION: The data indicate that bLf can be part of a therapeutic strategy to promote the immunomodulation effect, leading to homeostasis during COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: A promising dye for phototheranostics, IR-1048 is a near-infrared region II (NIR-II) cyanine dye that exhibits exceptional optical characteristics in NIR-II spectrum. Unfortunately, the biological applications of IR-1048 are challenged by its hydrophobic nature, the formation of face-to-face stacked dimeric aggregates (H-aggregates) that result in pronounced spectral blue shifts, and issues related to fluorescence quenching. Method: We present a novel docking strategy involving bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lactoferrin (Lf) to construct BSA@IR-1048 and Lf@IR-1048 nanoprobes. The NIR-II optical characteristics of these nanoprobes have been thoroughly investigated through both theoretical and experimental approaches. In addition, we conducted in vitro and in vivo evaluations of their NIR-II photothermal and photodynamic properties, multimodal imaging capabilities, and effectiveness in photoimmunotherapy. Results: Following the protein docking process, both BSA@IR-1048 and Lf@IR-1048 probes exhibited a red-shifted absorbance peak and an \"ON\" state in NIR-II fluorescence. Theoretical analyses alongside experimental results indicate that Lf@IR-1048, which has a higher docking binding energy of -10.83 kcal/mol, significantly enhances optical characteristics in the NIR-II region. Notably, when utilizing a single NIR-II light source, Lf@IR-1048 was effective in producing single-linear state oxygen and converting photons into heat energy, achieving a photo-thermal conversion efficiency of 41.9%. The overexpression of transferrin receptors in tumor cells also improved tumor-targeting and enrichment capabilities of Lf@IR-1048, as demonstrated vitro and in vivo studies. Comparatively, Lf@IR-1048 facilitated multimodal imaging-guided NIR-II phototherapy, showing an impressive tumor development inhibition rate of 94.8%. Furthermore, in bilateral CT26 tumor-bearing mice, the Lf@IR-1048-based photo-immunotherapy exhibited significant antitumor activity, attributed to enhanced dendritic cell maturation and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusion: Lf@IR-1048 displays a powerful combination of photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and tumor-targeting potential for effective multimodal imaging-guided NIR-II phototherapy, leading to substantial inhibition of tumor growth.",

      "abstract": "Recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) is of commercial interest for immune support as a food ingredient. The objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity/alloimmunization potential of Helaina rhLF (effera™) from K. phaffii over a 28-day period compared to bovine LF (bLF). Study 1 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel arm, controlled trial where 66 healthy adults were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups: high-dose rhLF (3.4 g/d), low-dose rhLF (0.34 g/d), or bLF (3.4 g/d). Participants completed a 28-day supplementation period with follow-up visits on Days 28, 56, and 84. Study 2 was a 12-week observational study with no intervention that enrolled 24 healthy adults. In both studies, serum was obtained for analysis of anti-LF antibody levels as the primary endpoint. In Study 1, change from baseline to Day 56 in serum anti-bLF antibodies in the bLF group (least squares geometric mean and 95% confidence interval for the post/pre ratio: 3.01; 2.08, 4.35) was greater than the changes in serum anti-hLF antibodies in the low-dose rhLF (1.07; 0.77, 1.49; P < 0.001) and high-dose rhLF (1.02; 0.62, 1.70; P < 0.001) groups. The rhLF groups had similar changes to the observational study, indicating no change in anti-hLF antibodies and no evidence of alloimmunization following ingestion. Changes in safety outcomes were similar between groups and within normal ranges. These results show that under the conditions of the protocol, no increased anti-hLF antibodies or adverse events were identified following ingestion of effera™ as a food ingredient at an intake level up to 3.4 g/d in healthy adults (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06012669).",

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional protein abundant in breast milk that modulates the functions of neural stem cells. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of bovine LF (bLF) in mitigating behavioral changes; however, the molecular mechanisms on the nervous system have not yet been elucidated. The presented study aimed to characterize the molecular mechanisms of bLF on nerve extension in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were treated with 0.01-1000 µg/mL of bLF, and cell viability was determined using the cell counting kit-8 assay after treatment for 24 h. Morphometric evaluation was performed after 24 or 72 h of treatment with 50 ng/mL nerve growth factor (NGF) or 100-500 µg/mL bLF. The molecular mechanisms were investigated using Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR. Cell viability was significantly decreased after treatment with 600-1000 µg/mL bLF for 24 h compared with the control group. Morphometric evaluation revealed neurite outgrowth after 72 h of NGF treatment, with a significant increase in neurite outgrowth after treatment with 250 µg/mL bLF. The phosphorylated p44/42 expression ratio peaked at 5 min and persisted for up to 10 min. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed a significant decrease in MAP2 expression. Our findings suggested that bLF enhanced PC12 cell neurite outgrowth to a similar extent as NGF. These effects are thought to be mediated via the TrkA receptor and activated by the phosphorylated ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, this study demonstrates that bLF promotes neurite outgrowth via a pathway similar to that of NGF.",

This resulted in the revival of existing molecules and the increasing popularity of over-the-counter nutritional supplements. Among the latter, lactoferrin has been investigated as an adjuvant in COVID-19 therapy with conflicting results, mainly depending on different study designs. Considering that lactoferrin is one of the main components of human breast milk with anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activity, it is conceivable that such bioactive molecule could be effective in supporting anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection therapy, especially in infants and pregnant women, two subpopulations that have been poorly evaluated in the existing clinical trials. This narrative review is intended to offer insight into the existing literature on lactoferrin's biological functions and protective effects against COVID-19, with a special focus on pregnant women and their infants.",

      "abstract": "Increased levels of lactoferrin (Lf) are present in the aged brain and in the lesions of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and may contribute to the cascade of events involved in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection. However, whether Lf originates from astrocytes and functions within either the normal or pathological brain are unknown. Here, we employed mice with specific knockout of the astrocyte lactoferrin gene (named Lf-cKO) to explore its specific roles in the pathological process of PD. We observed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells, mitochondrial dysfunction of residual dopaminergic neurons, and motor deficits in Lf-cKO mice, which were significantly aggravated after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment. To further explore how astrocytic lactoferrin deficiency exacerbated PD-like manifestation in MPTP-treated mice, the critical molecules involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contacts and signaling pathways were investigated. In vitro and in vivo models, we found an aberrant level of effects implicated in glutamate and calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial morphology and functions, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondria-associated ER membranes, accompanied by signs of oxidative stress and ER stress, which increase the fragility of dopaminergic neurons. These findings confirm the existence of astrocytic Lf and its influence on the fate of dopaminergic neurons by regulating glutamate/calcium metabolism and ER-mitochondria signaling. Our findings may be a promising target for the treatment of PD.",

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) as an adjuvant combined with AMP (N6) in the treatment of E. coli-induced bacterial enteritis. Firstly, 40 female ICR mice were randomly divided into four groups. The ETEC-A, ETEC-B, and ETEC-C groups were gavaged with 0.2 mL of ETEC K88 at 5 × 109, 5 × 108, and 5 × 107 CFU/mL for three consecutive days, respectively, the CK control group was given PBS. Based on the clinical symptoms and intestinal changes, the optimal model dose of ETEC K88 was determined to be 5 × 108 CFU/mL. Sixty female ICR mice were randomly divided into six groups: CK group (uninfected), NC group (infected and untreated), N6 treatment group (20 mg/kg), bLf treatment group (100 mg/kg), bLf + N6-A treatment group (10 mg/kg N6+100 mg/kg bLf), and bLf + N6-B group (20 mg/kg N6+100 mg/kg bLf). The clinical symptoms, intestinal morphology, inflammatory response and serum metabolites were monitored. The results showed that compared with the NC group, the bLf-N6-A and bLf-N6-B treatment groups had significant reductions in TNF-α and IL-6, significant increases in IL-10, and significant reductions in endotoxin and DAO in plasma (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the bLf-N6-A and bLf-N6-B treatment groups significantly increased the expression of ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin, increased the height of small intestinal mucosal villi and VH/CD after ETEC K88-induced intestinal injury (p < 0.05). The combination of bLf and N6 relieved enteritis by balancing intestinal mucosal immunity, improving intestinal morphology and barrier function. BLf combined with N6 can be used as an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of bacterial enteritis.",

Results showed that LF-EGCG had stronger antioxidant activity, higher thermal stability, and better surface wettability than LF + EGCG. Meanwhile, the complexes showed no cytotoxicity within the tested concentration range (12.5-200 μg/mL). The HIPPEs stabilized with LF-EGCG possessed smaller droplet size, higher ζ-potential, and more uniform oil/water proton distribution. Covalent treatment also enhanced the storage, thermal, freeze-thaw and physical stability of LF HIPPEs. Furthermore, due to the higher antioxidant activity and denser microstructure, LF-EGCG HIPPE can more effectively inhibit the oxidation of fish oil."

Furthermore, Clin can induce alterations in the immune responses and oxidative stress. Lactoferrin, among other activities, participates in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and reduces dysbiosis induced by antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of native and iron-saturated bovine LF in a murine model of dysbiosis induced by Clin. Six groups of male C57BL/6 mice were treated with saline (control), Clin, native lactoferrin (nLF), iron-saturated lactoferrin (sLF), nLF/Clin, or sLF/Clin. Oxidation caused in the intestinal cells of the ileum of animals subjected to different treatments was analyzed, focusing on lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content. The expression of inflammatory mediators was determined by qRT-PCR. Treatment with Clin did not modify lipid peroxidation, but significantly increased protein carbonyl levels up to almost 5-fold respect to the control, an effect that was reversed by orally administering sLF to mice. Furthermore, Clin increased the expression of interleukin-6 and TNF-α by 1- and 2-fold change, respectively. This effect was reversed by treatment with nLF and sLF, decreasing the expression to basal levels. In conclusion, this study indicates that lactoferrin can prevent some of the effects of Clin on intestinal cells and their associated immune system.",

This condition can affect patients of all ages but is more common between 20 and 40 years of age, especially in females and individuals with periodontal disease. The study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy over time of a product for at-home treatment of dentin hypersensitivity. METHODS: One hundred five patients aged between 28 and 65 years were recruited, each with at least two hypersensitive teeth due to erosions, abrasions, gingival recessions, and/or periodontal diseases. Participants were selected through the Schiff Test and anamnestic evaluations, with compilation of periodontal records. Patients are instructed to use the product three times a day, to be applied with a soft-bristled toothbrush and/or topically as a gel on teeth with strong sensitivity and deep cervical lesions and gingival recessions. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between measurements at baseline and after scaling. However, significant differences were observed in follow-ups from the 1st to the 8th week, with a progressive decrease in values. The average trend of product efficacy increases over time according to the Schiff Test, with a significant improvement observed at follow-ups conducted after four and eight weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the product enriched with biomimetic hydroxyapatite and lactoferrin is effective in reducing the painful symptoms of dentin hypersensitivity and in counteracting the inflammatory state of the supporting tissues.",

      "abstract": "This prospective, randomized, controlled, therapeutic study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a product containing nucleotides and lactoferrin in maintaining or improving the clinical picture and laboratory findings of canine leishmaniosis (CanL). The safety and tolerance of this combination were also assessed. Forty Leishmania infantum-seropositive dogs, not requiring leishmanicidal and/or leishmaniostatic treatment, were enrolled in the study and randomized into treatment (TG) and placebo (CG) groups. Products A (containing nucleotides and lactoferrin) and B (placebo) were blindly administered to TG and CG, respectively, as palatable tablets at a rate of 1 tablet per 10 kg of weight once every 24 h for 6 months. Following inclusion (T0), dogs were followed up after 3 (T90) and 6 (T180) months. At each time point, for all animals enrolled physical examination and laboratory tests (complete blood count, biochemical panel including C-reactive protein [CRP] and ferritin, and serum protein electrophoresis) were performed. The immunofluorescence antibody test to detect antibodies for L. infantum (T0, T180), Ehrlichia canis (T0, T90, and T180), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (T0, T90, and T180) was executed. A CanL-dedicated clinical score, using a validated scale from 0 (i.e., absence of clinical signs) to 19, was assigned. Four dogs (n=2 in TG, n=2 in CG) did not complete the study. No statistically significant differences in CanL clinical score were observed between CG and TG at T0, T90 and T180. Both TG and CG showed significant variations in anti-L. infantum antibody titres (p=0.0001 and p=0.004, respectively). In TG, antibody titres decreased in 77.8 %, increased in 5.5 %, and remained stable in 16.7 % of dogs, while in CG, decreased in 27.8 %, increased in 50 %, and remained stable in 22.2 % of dogs. During the study, CRP and ferritin remained stable in TG and significantly increased in CG. At T180, 9 out of 18 dogs (50 %) enrolled in the CG, and 1 out of 18 (5.6 %) enrolled in the TG, developed an active form of leishmaniosis. No side effects were reported in any patient included. In conclusion, a 6-month oral administration of a supplement containing nucleotides and lactoferrin was effective in maintaining a stable clinical score, improving antibody titres and potentially reducing the progression from non-active to active forms in L. infatum seropositive dogs. Furthermore, the product was well-tolerated, easy to administer, and free of side effects.",

In this study, the bifunctional injectable hydrogel lactoferrin (Lf)/NZ2114/lithium magnesium silicate hydrogel (LMSH) was first successfully prepared through the electrostatic interaction method. The physical, biological, and efficacy properties are systematically analyzed with good shear-thinning capacity and biocompatibility. More importantly, it inhibits infection and promotes wound healing in a mouse wound infection model after 14 d treatment, and the bactericidal rate and healing rate were over 99.92% and nearly 100%, respectively. Meanwhile, the massive reduction of inflammatory cells, restoration of tissue structure, and angiogenesis in mice showed the anti-inflammatory and pro-healing properties of the hydrogel. The healed wounds showed thickening with more hair follicles and glands, suggesting that the hydrogel Lf/NZ2114/LMSH (Three in One) could be a better dressing candidate for the treatment of S. aureus-induced wound infections."

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin is a natural multifunctional glycoprotein with potential antidepressant-like effects. However, the mechanism of its antidepressant effect has not been explored from the perspective of gut flora metabolism. Therefore, we employed both 16S rDNA gene sequencing and LC-MS metabolomics analysis to investigate the regulatory effects and mechanisms of lactoferrin in a rat model of depression. After one week of acclimatization, twenty-four 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and equally assigned into three groups: the control group, the model group, and the lactoferrin intervention group. The control group rats were housed under standard conditions, while the rats in the model and lactoferrin intervention groups were individually housed and exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress for 44 days simultaneously. The lactoferrin intervention group was provided with water containing 2% lactoferrin (2 g/100 ml). Behavioural tests were conducted at week 7. Upon completion of the behavioral tests, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, humanely euthanized using a rat guillotine, and tissue samples were collected for further experiments. The results indicated that lactoferrin intervention led to an increase in sucrose solution consumption, horizontal movement distance, number of cross platforms, and residence time in the target quadrant. Additionally, it resulted in an increase in jejunal tight junction protein ZO-1 expression and a suppression of serum expression of inflammatory factors, Lipopolysaccharide and Diamine oxidase. In summary, lactoferrin can regulate the metabolic disorder of intestinal flora, reduce intestinal permeability, and further regulate the metabolic balance of hippocampal tissues through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This process ultimately alleviates the depression-like behavior in rats.",

      "abstract": "Increased astrocytic lactoferrin (Lf) expression was observed in the brains of elderly individuals and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Our previous study revealed that astrocytic Lf overexpression improved cognitive capacity by facilitating Lf secretion to neurons to inhibit β-amyloid protein (Aβ) production in APP/PS1 mice. Here, we further discovered that astrocytic Lf overexpression inhibited neuronal loss by decreasing iron accumulation and increasing glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression in neurons within APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, human Lf (hLf) treatment inhibited ammonium ferric citrate (FAC)-induced ferroptosis by chelating intracellular iron. Additionally, machine learning analysis uncovered a correlation between Lf and GPX4. hLf treatment boosted low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) internalization and facilitated its interaction with heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), thereby inhibiting HSC70 binds to GPX4, and eventually attenuating GPX4 degradation and FAC-induced ferroptosis. Overall, astrocytic Lf overexpression inhibited neuronal ferroptosis through two pathways: reducing intracellular iron accumulation and promoting GPX4 expression via inhibiting chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-mediated GPX4 degradation. Hence, upregulating astrocytic Lf expression is a promising strategy for combating AD.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common motor neurodegenerative disease that still lacks effective therapeutic options. Previous studies have reported that lactoferrin exhibited neuroprotective effects in cellular and animal models of PD, typically induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) synthetic toxin. However, the neuroprotective capacity of lactoferrin in the rotenone-induced cellular model of PD remains relatively less established. Unlike MPTP/MPP+, rotenone is a naturally occurring environmental toxin known to induce chronic toxicity and increase the risk of PD in humans. In this study, we constructed a cellular model of PD by differentiating SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with retinoic acid into mature dopaminergic neurons with increased β-tubulin III and tyrosine hydroxylase expression, followed by 24 h of rotenone exposure. Using this cellular model of PD, we showed that lactoferrin (1-10 µg/ml) pre-treatment for 48 h decreased loss of cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential impairment, reactive oxygen species generation and pro-apoptotic activities (pan-caspase activation and nuclear condensation) in cells exposed to rotenone (1 and 5 µM) using biochemical assays, Hoechst 33342 staining and immunocytochemical techniques. We further demonstrated that 48 h of lactoferrin (10 µg/ml) pre-treatment decreased Bax:Bcl2 ratio and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase expression but increased pAkt expression in 5 µM rotenone-exposed cells. Our study demonstrates that lactoferrin neuroprotective capacity is present in the rotenone-induced cellular model of PD, further supporting lactoferrin as a potential PD therapeutic that warrants further studies.",

Fifty adult male rats (160-200 g) were equally divided into five groups: (1) the saline control group, (2) BLM-injected (15 mg/kg twice a week, ip), and (3-5) groups treated orally with LF (200 mg/kg/day), SeNPs (0.0486 mg/kg/day) or LF/SeNPs combination (200.0486 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks post BLM-intoxication. Blood and liver samples were subjected to biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analyses. The results revealed that BLM caused a significant increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide, as well as serum markers of liver functions (AST, ALT and GGT activities), and levels of GM-CSF, CD4, TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1, fibronectin, triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL-C. Additionally, hepatic glutathione, Na+/K+-ATPase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as serum HDL-C, total protein and albumin levels were significantly reduced. Moreover, BLM injection resulted in marked histopathological alterations and severe expression of caspase 3. Post-treatment of BLM-intoxicated rats with LF, SeNPs or LF/SeNPs combination obviously improved the BLM-induced hepatic damages; this was achieved from the marked modulations in the mentioned parameters, besides improving the histopathological hepatic architecture. It is worth mentioning that LF/SeNPs exerted the greatest potency. In conclusion, the obtained results demonstrated that LF, SeNPs and LF/SeNPs succeeded in attenuating the BLM-induced hepatic dysfunction. Therefore, these supplements might be used to protect against drug-associated side effects.",

Compared to Rif@BSA NPs, the Rif@Lf NPs can specifically target macrophages infected by bacteria, thus increasing the accumulation of Rif within macrophages. Subsequently, Rif@Lf NPs with positive surface charge further displayed targeted adherence to the bacteria within macrophages and released Rif rapidly in a redox-responsive manner. Combined with the antibacterial activities of Lf and Rif, the Rif@Lf NPs showed broad-spectrum antibiotic abilities to intracellular bacteria and biofilms. As a result, the Rif@Lf NPs with high safety exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy in the disease models of subcutaneous infection, sepsis, and bacterial keratitis. Taken together, the antibiotic-loaded Lf nanoparticles present a promising platform to combat pathogen infections through targeted elimination of intracellular bacteria."

Due to the poor bioavailability of curcumin, it is challenging to achieve effective concentrations at the target sites. Nano-micelles are known for their ability to improve the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of hydrophobic compounds like curcumin. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of free curcumin and curcumin embedded in nano-micelles (M(Cur)) on oxidative stress-induced injury in bEnd.3 cells. RESULTS: At a protective concentration of 10 μg mL-1, micellar curcumin was better able to recover the morphology of bEnd.3 cells under oxidative stress while increasing cell viability, restoring mitochondrial membrane electrical potential, and effectively inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation with a positive cell rate of 2.21%. These results indicate that curcumin significantly improves H2O2-induced oxidative stress damage in endothelial cells by maintaining the cellular antioxidant balance. CONCLUSION: This study adds to knowledge regarding the role of nano-micelles in curcumin intervention for endothelial cell oxidative damage and provides insights for the development of curcumin-based dietary supplements. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Here, we present data about Valpalf®, a new formulation containing bLf, sodium citrate, and sodium bicarbonate at a molar ratio of 10-3. In the present study, Valpalf® exhibits superior iron-binding capacity, resistance to tryptic digestion, and a greater capacity to accumulate into the nucleus over time when compared to the native bLf alone. In agreement, Valpalf® effectively reduces interleukin(IL)-6 levels in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages and modulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-stimulated monocytes. Of note, this potentiated bioactivity was corroborated in a retrospective study on the treatment of anemia of inflammation in hereditary thrombophilic pregnant and non-pregnant women, demonstrating that Valpalf® improves hematological parameters and reduces serum IL-6 levels to a higher extent than bLf alone.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The increasing resistance of Malassezia yeasts against commonly used antifungal drugs dictates the need for novel antifungal compounds. Human lactoferrin-based peptides show a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities. Various assays were performed to find the optimal growth conditions of the yeasts and to assess cell viability, using media with low lipid content to avoid peptide binding to medium components. METHODS: In the current study, we tested the antimicrobial susceptibility of 30 strains of M. furfur that cover the known IGS1 genotypic variation. RESULTS: hLF(1-11) inhibited the growth of all species tested, resulting in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. In the combinatory tests, the majority of fractional inhibitory concentration indexes (FIC) for the tested strains of M. furfur were up to 1.0, showing that there is a synergistic or additive effect on the efficacy of the antifungal drugs when used in combination with hLF(1-11). CONCLUSION: Results showed that hLF(1-11) could be combined with fluconazole or amphotericin for the antimicrobial treatment of resistant strains, enhancing the potency of these antifungal drugs, resulting in an improved outcome for the patient."

We characterized 972 bp of piglet brain LfR cDNA and found LfR mRNA was expressed all brain regions being highest in the frontal lobe, followed by parietal lobe, brainstem, occipital lobe, cingulate gyrus, subventricular zone, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus. LfR mRNA and protein in different regions of the brain responded to low (155 mg/kg/day) and high (285 mg/kg/day) LF supplementation of piglets from postnatal days 3 to 38. By postnatal day 39, the low LF diet significantly increased LfR protein expression in the occipital lobe compared to controls, but not the high LF diet. LfR protein in the subventricular zone of the high LF group was 42% and 38% higher than that of the low LF group and controls, respectively. There was a trend for a dose-response relationship between LF intervention and LfR protein expression only in the prefrontal and parietal lobes. LF supplementation significantly improved piglet working memory for a difficult task, which was positively correlated with LfR protein in the prefrontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, but no dose response. Brain LfR responds to dietary LF supplementation, a mechanism by which LF can promote learning and working memory through its receptor. LfR is expressed in the whole brain, and its expression level is anatomic region specific.",

      "abstract": "The main reasons for the difficulty in curing and high recurrence rate of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) include: 1. The difficulty of chemotherapy drugs in penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to target tumor cells; 2. The presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs) leading to chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, breaking through the limitations of the BBB and overcoming the drug resistance caused by GSCs are the main strategies to address this problem. This study presents our results on the development of lactoferrin (Lf)/CD133 antibody conjugated nanostructured lipid carriers (Lf/CD133-NLCS) for simultaneously targeting BBB and GSCs. Temozolomide (TMZ) loaded Lf/CD133-NLCS (Lf/CD133-NLCS-TMZ) exhibited high-efficiencyin vitroanti-tumor effects toward malignant glioma cells (U87-MG) and GSCs, while demonstrating no significant toxicity to normal cells at concentrations lower than 200 μg ml-1. The results of thein vitrotargeting GBM study revealed a notably higher cellular uptake of Lf/CD133-NLCS-TMZ in U87-MG cells and GSCs in comparison to Lf/CD133 unconjugated counterpart (NLCS-TMZ). In addition, increased BBB permeability were confirmed for Lf/CD133-NLCS-TMZ compared to NLCS-TMZ bothin vitroandin vivo. Taking together, Lf/CD133-NLCS-TMZ show great potential for dual targeting of BBB and GSCs, as well as GBM therapy based on this strategy.",

The aim of the current report is to evaluate the effects of a combination of lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactobacillus, resveratrol, vitamins, and oligoelements (PIRV-F20®) on the exercise capacity of post-COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients referred to a specific outpatient clinic dedicated to post-COVID-19 condition from April 2022 to April 2023 was conducted. Subjects of both sexes, aged ≥18 years, with previous COVID-19 in the preceding 12 months, persistent symptoms consistent with post-COVID syndrome, and initial exercise impairment were included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: active cancer, end-stage conditions, severe musculoskeletal conditions, or patients with a history of limited functional capacity, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Patients who reported having taken PIRV-F20® for at least 6 weeks were compared to patients who refused this treatment. Six-minute walking distance was the primary endpoint. Results: Forty-four patients (56.8% women, aged 49.1 ± 18.1 years) were included in the study. The group of patients who reported having taken PIRV-F20® exhibited a significant improvement of 6MWD (median: +40 m; IQR: 10-65 m, p vs. baseline: 0.02), which was significantly superior (p: 0.01) when compared to the controls (median: +10 m; IQR: -5-30 m). No differences were found with regard to muscular strength, echocardiographic parameters, and perception of symptoms. Conclusions: Post-COVID-19 individuals who reported having taken PIRV-F20® for at least six weeks showed a significant improvement in exercise capacity. This finding should be confirmed in larger, prospective, randomized controlled trials."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Children with moderate or severe wasting are at particularly high risk of recurrent or persistent diarrhoea, nutritional deterioration and death following a diarrhoeal episode. Lactoferrin and lysozyme are nutritional supplements that may reduce the risk of recurrent diarrhoeal episodes and accelerate nutritional recovery by treating or preventing underlying enteric infections and/or improving enteric function. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this factorial, blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial, we aim to determine the efficacy of lactoferrin and lysozyme supplementation in decreasing diarrhoea incidence and improving nutritional recovery in Kenyan children convalescing from comorbid diarrhoea and wasting. Six hundred children aged 6-24 months with mid-upper arm circumference <12.5 cm who are returning home after an outpatient visit or inpatient hospital stay for diarrhoea will be enrolled. Children will be randomised to 16 weeks of lactoferrin, lysozyme, a combination of the two, or placebo and followed for 24 weeks, with biweekly home visits by community health workers and clinic visits at 4, 10, 16 and 24 weeks. The primary analysis will compare the incidence of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and time to nutritional recovery between each intervention arm and placebo. The trial will also test whether these interventions reduce enteric pathogen carriage, decrease enteric permeability and/or increase haemoglobin concentration in enrolled children. Finally, we will evaluate the acceptability, adherence and cost-effectiveness of lactoferrin and/or lysozyme. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by the institutional review boards of the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the University of Washington, the Kenyan Pharmacy and Poisons Board, and the Kenyan National Commission on Science, Technology and Innovation. The results of this trial will be shared with local and international stakeholders and published in peer-reviewed journals, and the key findings will be presented at relevant conferences.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anemia occurs in majority of patients with chronic kidney disease despite adequate dialysis and iron replete status. This study was done to evaluate the effects of lactoferrin with or without iron supplementation for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, observational, single-center, single-arm pilot study, adult patients aged >18 years, having stage 5 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min/1.73 m2), and who had anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] <10 g/dl; transferrin saturation [Tsat] >20%) were included. Patients were treated with 100 mg of oral lactoferrin twice a day for one month with or without iron supplementation. Patients had been on stable erythropoietin doses for ≥1 month prior to inclusion in the study. We report on the improvement in Hb levels and effect on inflammatory markers from baseline at four weeks. RESULTS: A total of 46 CKD patients having anemia were included. Patients had a mean age of 39.3 years, and a majority were men (69.6%). Improvement in the mean (SD) Hb level (g/dl) was observed from baseline (8.18 [1.19]) to Week 2 (8.54 [1.57]), which attained significance at Week 4 (8.96 [1.93]; P < 0.001; mean difference: -0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.291 to - 0.2383). The improvement in Hb was higher in women than in men (P = 0.48) and in patients receiving lactoferrin with iron supplementation than in those receiving lactoferrin alone (P = 0.14). There was a non-significant decrease in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.14) and a non-significant increase in C-reactive protein (P = 0.54) level. CONCLUSION: Oral lactoferrin therapy was effective in improving hemoglobin levels in patients with advanced CKD and anemia. The effects of lactoferrin therapy on inflammatory markers remain uncertain."

The formation of covalent bond between lactoferrin and polyphenol was verified by the increase in molecular weight. In LF-EGCG group, the surface hydrophobicity, interfacial pressure, and adsorption rate were decreased, while the molecular flexibility, interfacial film viscoelasticity, and interfacial protein content were increased. Meanwhile, LF-EGCG HIPPE possessed reduced droplet size, increased ζ-potential and stability. Rheology showed the viscoelasticity, structural recovery and gel strength of LF-EGCG HIPPE were improved, giving HIPPE inks better 3D printing integrity and clarity. Moreover, the free fatty acids (FFA) release of LF-EGCG HIPPE (62.6%) was higher than that of the oil group (50.1%). Therefore, covalent treatment effectively improved the interfacial properties of protein particles and the stability of HIPPEs. The macroscopic properties of HIPPEs were positively regulated by the interfacial properties of protein particles. The result suggested that the stability of emulsions can be improved by regulating the interfacial properties of particles.",

Here, we present a retrospective pilot study on women affected from IC/PBS and treated with bovine lactoferrin (bLf). A total of 31 women, affected (20) or unaffected (11) from hereditary thrombophilia (HT), presented the median of 6 episodes of IC/PBS during the 6 months before the study. Treatment consisted of 17 weeks of orally administered Valpalf® capsules, containing bLf plus sodium bicarbonate and citrate. Out of 31 patients, only 3 women had one episode of IC/PBS during the follow-up period, while no episode was observed in 28 women. In the HT group, a significant decrease in both serum IL-6 and D-dimers was found after Valpalf® treatment. Moreover, in Valpalf®-treated women, cystoscopy revealed a global improvement in the appearance of the bladder, especially in term of inflammation/irritation and presence of Hunner ulcers. Even if our results must be corroborated by randomized double-blinded controlled trials on a larger number of patients, our observations indicate that bLf treatment is efficient in relieving IC/PBS symptoms, without side effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long COVID is a heterogeneous condition with a variety of symptoms that persist at least 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, often with a profound impact on quality of life. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein with anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Current hypotheses regarding long COVID aetiology include ongoing immune activation, viral persistence and auto-immune dysregulation. Therefore, we hypothesised that long COVID patients may potentially benefit from lactoferrin treatment. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of lactoferrin on various long COVID domains: fatigue, anxiety, depression, cognitive failure and muscle strength. METHODS: We performed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in long COVID patients aged 18-70 years within 12 months after proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were randomised (1:1) to 6 weeks of lactoferrin (1200 mg daily) or placebo. At three hospital visits (T0, T6 and T12 weeks), patient-reported outcome measures were collected, physical performance tests were performed and blood was drawn. The difference in fatigue at T6 was the primary outcome. RESULTS: 72 participants were randomised to lactoferrin (n=36) or placebo (n=36). We found a significant decrease in fatigue, as measured with the Fatigue Assessment Scale, between T0 and T6 in both study arms, but without significant difference between the study arms (lactoferrin: 3.9, 95% CI 2.3-5.5, p=0.007; placebo: 4.1, 95% CI 2.3-5.9, p=0.013). No significant differences were found in any of the other outcomes in favour of the lactoferrin arm at T6 or T12. CONCLUSION: Although both long COVID arms showed improved clinical outcomes at T6, the improvement did not continue until T12. Lactoferrin provided no benefit in terms of fatigue, other patient-reported outcome measures or physical functioning."

Atrophic changes mainly located in the vulvar vestibule and vulnerability to vulvovaginal infections in postmenopause could be predisposing factors to the development of vulvar burning/pain and introital dyspareunia (vestibulodynia secondary to atrophy). Tibolone is the most effective and safe alternative for treating menopausal symptoms. The role of Lactobacilli and lactoferrin shows its effectiveness in the treatment of vaginal microbiota dysbiosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of the combination of tibolone and an oral-specific Lactobacilli mixture in combination with bovine lactoferrin as synergistic therapy for the treatment of vestibulodynia related to atrophy. METHODS: In this study, we included 35 postmenopausal women with at least 1 year of amenorrhea, affected by vulvar burning/pain and introital dyspareunia. All participants received treatment with open-label, oral Tibolone 2.5 mg and Lactobacilli mixture (5 × 109 CFU per capsule) in combination with bovine lactoferrin (Respecta®). Each product was taken once daily for 90 days. RESULTS: After 90 d of therapy with TIB+ Respecta®, in 30 women that completed the treatment, there was a statistically significant decrease from the baseline in the mean of the Visual Analog Scale for vulvar burning/pain and a reduction in scores in the pain evaluation test. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the combination of TIB+ Respecta® was effective in reducing symptoms related to vestibular pain and hypersensitivity in a postmenopausal setting.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Avian coccidiosis presents a significant challenge to the poultry industry in Egypt, highlighting the urgent need for validating new drug targets offering promising prospects for the development of advanced anticoccidials. Although numerous reports highlight the activity of lactoferrin (LF) against various microorganisms, its potential against Eimeria has not been explored. The present study evaluated the potential anticoccidial effect of LF and diclazuril in broiler chickens experimentally infected with Eimeria tenella. METHODS: A total of 100 one-day-old broiler chicks were divided into five equal groups (20 each) as follows: Group 1 (G1) served as the normal healthy control group, Group 2 (G2) consisted of chickens infected with 1 × 105 sporulated E. tenella oocysts at 14 days of age, Group 3 (G3) comprised infected chickens treated with diclazuril (0.5 mL/L in drinking water) for 3 days successively, Group 4 (G4) included infected chickens treated with LF (at a dose of 250 mg/kg of diet) from one day of age until the end of the study, and Group 5 (G5) comprised infected chickens treated with both LF and diclazuril. RESULTS: The positive control group (G2) experienced significant reductions in body weight (BW), BW gain, serum glucose, lipase, amylase, total antioxidant capacity, several hematological indices, and total proteins, along with alterations in various antioxidant enzymes. Conversely, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline phosphatases (ALP), urea, creatinine, nitric oxide, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), White blood cells (WBCs), heterophils, alpha 2, beta 1, and liver contents of malondialdehyde were elevated in this group. Moreover, higher oocyst counts and lesion scores, along with histopathological alterations, were observed in G2. Remarkably, treatment with diclazuril and/or LF demonstrated potent antioxidant and anticoccidial effects, resulting in reduced shedding of oocysts, lesion scores, and lymphocytic infiltrates in the cecum. Additionally, these treatments improved the antioxidant and immune systems in chickens and restored all histopathological changes reported in the infected non-treated group (G2). CONCLUSION: This study offers novel perspectives on the potential anticoccidial effects of the combination of LF and diclazuril in broiler chickens infected with E. tenella, highlighting the potential synergistic actions of LF in treating poultry coccidiosis."

LF mediates both iron-dependent and iron-independent mechanisms, and the role of LF in regulating iron homeostasis is vital in terms of metabolism. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the organ-level effect and gene expression change of bLf in the cutaneous repair process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An excisional full-thickness skin defect (FTSD) wound model was created in male Sprague Dawley rats (180-250 g) (n = 48) fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and the PHGPx, SLC7A11 and SLC40A1 genes and iron metabolism were evaluated. The animals were randomly divided into 6 groups: 1- Control, 2- bLf (200 mg/kg/day, oral), 3- FTSD (12 mm in diameter, dorsal), 4- HFD + bLf, 5- HFD + FTSD, 6- HFD + FTSD + bLf. Histologically, iron accumulation was demonstrated by Prussian blue staining in the liver, kidney, and intestinal tissues. Gene expression analysis was performed with qPCR. RESULTS: Histologically, iron accumulation was demonstrated by Prussian blue staining in the liver, kidney, and intestinal tissues. Prussian blue reactions were detected in the kidney. PHPGx and SLC7A11 genes in kidney and liver tissue were statistically significant (P < 0.05) except for the SLC40A1 gene (P > 0.05). Expression changes of the three genes were not statistically significant in analyses of rat intestinal tissue (P = 0.057). CONCLUSION: In the organ-level ferroptotic damage mechanism triggered by wound formation. BLf controls the expression of three genes and manages iron deposition in these three tissues. In addition, it suppressed the increase in iron that would drive the cell to ferroptosis and anemia caused by inflammation, thereby eliminating iron deposition in the tissues.",

All participants received treatment with 200 mg of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) once (n = 14) or twice (n = 3) a day before meals. The patients, treated with 200 mg/day of bLf, exhibited a significant increase in red blood cells (+10%, p < 0.001), hemoglobin (+4%, p < 0.001), and hematocrit (+15%, p = 0.004), accompanied by a significant reduction in serum Ftn levels (-52%, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (-85.0%, p < 0.001), and D-dimers (-19%, p < 0.001).

The decrease in serum Ftn levels due to bLf treatment was largely independent of gender (p = 0.78), age (p = 0.66), baseline symptoms (p = 0.20), and concomitant acute (p = 0.34) and chronic (p = 0.53) infections.

Advanced delivery systems are desirable to fully leverage its therapeutic potential in treating ocular diseases. The process of Lf quantification for diagnostic purposes underscores the importance of developing reliable, cost-effective detection methods, ranging from conventional techniques to advanced nano-based sensors. Despite the ease and non-invasiveness of topical administration for ocular surface diseases, challenges such as rapid drug elimination necessitate innovations, such as Lf-loaded contact lenses and biodegradable polymeric nanocapsules, to enhance drug stability and bioavailability. Furthermore, overcoming ocular barriers for the treatment of posterior segment disease calls for nano-formulations. The scope of this review is to underline the advancements in nanotechnology-based Lf delivery methods, emphasizing the pivotal role of multidisciplinary approaches and cross-field strategies in improving ocular drug delivery and achieving better therapeutic outcomes for a wide spectrum of eye conditions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is an age-related condition characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function. The occurrence of sarcopenia has a huge impact on physical, psychological, and social health. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia is becoming an important public health issue. METHOD: 35 six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups, one of which served as a control group, while the rest of the groups were constructed as a model of sarcopenia by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose. The intervention with lactoferrin, creatine, and their mixtures, respectively, was carried out through gavage for 8 weeks. Muscle function was assessed based on their endurance, hanging time, and grip strength. The muscle tissues were weighed to assess the changes in mass, and the muscle RNA was extracted for myogenic factor expression and transcriptome sequencing to speculate on the potential mechanism of action by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. RESULT: The muscle mass (lean mass, GAS index), and muscle function (endurance, hanging time, and grip strength) decreased, and the size and structure of myofiber was smaller in the model group compared to the control group. The intervention with lactoferrin and creatine, either alone or combination, improved muscle mass and function, restored muscle tissue, and increased the expression of myogenic regulators. The combined group demonstrated the most significant improvement in these indexes. The RNA-seq results revealed enrichment in the longevity-regulated pathway, MAPK pathway, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction pathway in the intervention group. The intervention group may influence muscle function by affecting the proliferation, differentiation, senescence of skeletal muscle cell, and contraction of muscle fiber. The combined group also enriched the mTOR-S6K/4E-BPs signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and energy metabolism-related pathways, including Apelin signaling, insulin resistance pathway, and adipocytokine signaling pathway, which affect energy metabolism in muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Lactoferrin and creatine, either alone or in combination, were found to inhibit the progression of sarcopenia by influencing the number and cross-sectional area of muscle fibers and muscle protein synthesis. The combined intervention appears to exert a more significant effect on energy metabolism.",

Complexes were formed between LF, succinylated sodium caseinate (S.NaCas) and FeSO4 with high yield (∼85%). LF-S.NaCas-Fe complexes achieved loading capacities for iron(II) between 2.5 and 12 mg g-1and LF loading capacities between 250 and 690 mg g-1, depending upon initial Fe2+ concentrations and LF ratios. The LF-S.NaCas complex mixtures appeared as smooth cubic particles in SEM, and gradually aggregated to amorphous particles as th iron(II) concentration increased due to iron-facilitated cross-linking. The complexation significantly improved LF thermal stability and addressed the poor solubility of iron(II) under neutral pH. After thermal treatment (95 °C, 5 min), the rehydrated complexes retained 68%-90% LF, with <10% iron(II) release. Circular dichroism spectra showed the secondary structure of the complexed LF was well retained during thermal treatment. This thermally stable system showed great potential in LF thermal protection and iron(II) fortification."

Our study assessed pancreatic tissues functional and histopathological alterations following prolonged oral administration of HCQ. We also investigated the possible ameliorative effects of the lactoferrin (LF) coadministration with HCQ in adult male albino rats. Forty adult male Wister albino rats were divided into: negative control, LF positive control (2 g/kg), HCQ-treated (200 mg/kg), and HCQ+LF treated. Biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical, and morphometric analyses of the pancreatic tissues were conducted. Our findings revealed that prolonged oral administration of HCQ induced significant disruption of the pancreatic acinar architecture, enlarged congested islets of Langerhans, and elevated plasma insulin, amylase, and lipase levels. Interestingly, LF administration ameliorated the deleterious effects of prolonged HCQ administration on pancreatic tissue of adult male albino rats. In conclusion, prolonged oral administration of HCQ induced pancreatic tissue damage in rats, while LF attenuates HCQ-induced pancreatic injury. Our results emphasized the necessity of prescribing HCQ with caution, considering both dosage and treatment duration.",

An innovative resolution is bone-homing and selective-active targeting of anticancer loaded-nanovectors. Herein, ivermectin (IVM) and methyl dihydrojasmonate (MDJ)-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (IVM-NLC) were formulated then dually decorated by lactoferrin (Lf) and alendronate (Aln) to optimize (Aln/Lf/IVM-NLC) for active-targeting and bone-homing potential, respectively. Aln/Lf/IVM-NLC (1 mg) revealed nano-size (73.67 ± 0.06 nm), low-PDI (0.43 ± 0.06), sustained-release of IVM (62.75 % at 140-h) and MDJ (78.7 % at 48-h). Aln/Lf/IVM-NLC afforded substantial antileukemic-cytotoxicity on K562-cells (4.29-fold lower IC50), higher cellular uptake and nuclear fragmentation than IVM-NLC with acceptable cytocompatibility on oral-epithelial-cells (as normal cells). Aln/Lf/IVM-NLC effectively upregulated caspase-3 and BAX (4.53 and 15.9-fold higher than IVM-NLC, respectively). Bone homing studies verified higher hydroxyapatite affinity of Aln/Lf/IVM-NLC (1 mg; 22.88 ± 0.01 % at 3-h) and higher metaphyseal-binding (1.5-fold increase) than untargeted-NLC. Moreover, Aln/Lf/IVM-NLC-1 mg secured 1.35-fold higher in vivo bone localization than untargeted-NLC, with lower off-target distribution. Ex-vivo hemocompatibility and in-vivo biocompatibility of Aln/Lf/IVM-NLC (1 mg/mL) were established, with pronounced amelioration of hepatic and renal toxicity compared to higher Aln doses. The innovative Aln/Lf/IVM-NLC could serve as a promising nanovector for bone-homing, active-targeted leukemia therapy.",

      "abstract": "It is said that a wide range of renal functions are at risk from arsenic exposure. We examined how lactoferrin administration may mitigate inflammation, apoptosis, redox imbalance, and fibrosis in order to counteract arsenic-induced nephrotoxicity. Accordingly, male C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks) were divided into six experimental groups with six mice in each group. The first and second groups were intragastrically administered normal saline and sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) at 5 mg/kg body weight concentrations as the negative control (NC) and NaAsO2 groups. The third, fourth, and fifth groups were intragastrically administered lactoferrin at concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight in addition to NaAsO2 at concentrations of 5 mg/kg body weight. The sixth group was intragastrically administered lactoferrin at a concentration of 200 mg/kg body weight with the experimental group set as the lactoferrin group. After daily drug administration for 4 weeks, the lactoferrin concentrations were optimized based on the results of renal index and renal function. Histopathological, biochemical, and gene expression analyses were performed to evaluate the status of renal tissue architecture, redox imbalance, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis to confirm the alleviative effect of lactoferrin treatment against the NaAsO2 exposure-induced nephrotoxicity. The results confirmed that the 200 mg/kg lactoferrin treatment mitigated these arsenic effects and maintained the normal renal frameworks. Conclusively, disrupting the renal redox balance and triggering inflammation, apoptosis, along with fibrosis is a milieu that arsenic, robustly exerts its nephrotoxic effect. Lactoferrin, probably by its direct and indirect control mechanism on these said pathways, can mitigate the nephrotoxicity and preserve the normal renal health.",

Due to rapid elimination and poor bioavailability, treatment with APO is challenging. Correspondingly, novel APO-loaded lipid nanocapsules (APO-LNC) were formulated and coated with lactoferrin (LF-APO-LNC) to improve br ain targetability and prolong residence time. Lavender oil (LAV) was incorporated into LNC as a bioactive ingredient to act synergistically with APO in alleviating pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures. The optimized LF-APO-LAV/LNC showed a particle size 59.7 ± 4.5 nm with narrow distribution and 6.07 ± 1.6mV zeta potential) with high entrapment efficiency 92 ± 2.4% and sustained release (35% in 72 h). Following subcutaneous administration, LF-APO-LAV/LNC brought about ⁓twofold increase in plasma AUC and MRT compared to APO. A Log BB value of 0.2 ± 0.14 at 90 min reflects increased brain accumulation. In a PTZ-induced seizures rat model, LF-APO-LAV/LNC showed a Modified Racine score of 0.67 ± 0.47 with a significant increase in seizures latency and decrease in duration. Moreover, oxidant/antioxidant capacity and inflammatory markers levels in brain tissue were significantly improved. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assessment of brain tissue sections further supported these findings. The results suggest APO/LAV combination in LF-coated LNC as a promising approach to counteract seizures.",

By virtue of Lf presence, bovine colostrum is expected to perform analogous functions to pure Lf, along with additional activities attributable to other bioactive constituents. The present research aims to compare the antibacterial, anti-invasive, and anti-inflammatory activities of bovine Lf purified from milk (mbLf) and colostrum (cbLf) in comparison to those exhibited by whole bovine colostrum (wbc). The results demonstrated a major efficacy of mbLf in inhibiting pathogenic bacteria and in exerting anti-invasive and anti-survival activities with respect to cbLf and wbc. Furthermore, mbLf lowered IL-6 levels to those of uninfected cells, while a less evident decrease was observed upon cbLf treatment. Conversely, wbc managed to slightly lower IL-6 levels compared to those synthesized by infected cells. These data demonstrate that, to obtain maximum effectiveness in such activities, Lf should be formulated/used without addition of other substances and should be sourced from bovine milk rather than colostrum.",

In this study, the effect of lactoferrin (Lf) on the expression level of ATG101, mTOR and AMPK genes in breast cancer cell line MCF7, as well as the interaction between lactoferrin protein and their protein were investigated. The expression level of the genes was measured using a real-time PCR method. PDB, UniProt, KEGG, and STRING databases and ClusPro webserver and PyMol software were used in silico study. The results showed that the expression level of the ATG101 gene in treatment with concentrations of 100, 400, 600, and 800 μg/ml Lf decreased by 0.05, 0.13, 0.54 and 0.77, respectively. The expression level of the mTOR gene in treatment with concentrations of 100, 400, 600, and 800 μg/ml Lf decreased by 0.07, 0.05, 0.13, and 0.49 times respectively.

Virtualization of the interaction of Lf protein with ATG101, mTOR and AMPK proteins by Pymol software showed that the N lobe region of Lf interacted with the HORMA domain of ATG101 protein, the fat domain of mTOR protein, and the CTD domain of AMPK protein. Although Lf was not able to increase the expression of autophagy-inducing genes, it may be able to induce autophagy through protein interaction by activating or inhibiting proteins related to autophagy regulation.",

Due to its many contributing factors and frequent relapses, CADS is difficult to manage. Given the rise in drug resistance among fungal species, it is critical to develop new therapeutic approaches, reduce the required dosage of medications, and minimize the toxicity and side effects of therapy. HIGHLIGHT: Salivary lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein, is thought to be the first line of defense against microbial invasion of mucosal surfaces. CONCLUSION: Current research emphasizes the capability of lactoferrin and its derivatives to eliminate a broad spectrum of Candida species. It may be an appealing option for use in monotherapy or in combination with common medications for oral stomatitis treatment. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of lactoferrin's anti-fungal effects in oral candidiasis.",

Three polymethoxyflavonoids and two milk proteins were exposed to the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. β-hexosaminidase was used as an indicator of degranulation inhibition. The mechanism of inhibition was examined by measuring intracellular Ca2+ levels and western blot method. In the degranulation inhibition test with polymethoxyflavonoids and milk proteins alone, nobiletin was the strongest inhibitor in the polymethoxyflavonoid group and lactoferrin in the milk protein group. Next, co-stimulation with nobiletin and lactoferrin showed stronger synergistic degranulation inhibition than treatment with nobiletin or lactoferrin alone. Western blot analysis showed that co-stimulation with nobiletin and lactoferrin significantly downregulated the induction of phospholipase Cγ 1 phosphorylation. The degranulation response in RBL-2H3 cells was synergistically suppressed by co-stimulation of nobiletin and lactoferrin acting on both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent pathways."

In this study, we proposed that lactoferrin (LFcinB11) may be a better candidate for inhibiting NCAM polysialylation when compared with CMP and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), which were determined based on our NMR studies. Furthermore, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) represent the most dramatic stage in the cell death process, and the release of NETs is related to the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, with proposed involvement in glomerulonephritis, chronic lung disease, sepsis, and vascular disorders. In this study, the molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of NET release using LFcinB11 as an inhibitor were also determined. Based on these results, LFcinB11 is proposed as being a bifunctional inhibitor for inhibiting both NCAM polysialylation and the release of NETs.",

Chlorogenic acid is a natural plant polyphenol with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Bovine lactoferrin is known for its immunomodulatory, anticancer, antibacterial, and iron-chelating properties. Therefore, the non-covalent binding of chlorogenic acid (CA) and bovine lactoferrin (BLF) with different concentrations under neutral conditions was studied. CA was grafted onto lactoferrin molecules by laccase catalysis, free radical grafting, and alkali treatment. The formation mechanism of non-covalent and covalent complexes of CA-BLF was analyzed by experimental test and theoretical prediction. Compared with the control BLF, the secondary structure of BLF in the non-covalent complex was rearranged and unfolded to provide more active sites, the tertiary structure of the covalent conjugate was changed, and the amino group of the protein participated in the covalent reaction. After adding CA, the covalent conjugates have better functional activity. These lactoferrin-polyphenol couplings can carry various bioactive compounds to create milk-based delivery systems for encapsulation."

Clinical observations, body weight, hematology, clinical chemistry, iron parameters, immunophenotyping, and gross examination at necropsy were used as criteria for detecting the effects of treatment in all groups and to help select dose levels for future toxicology studies. Quantitative LF levels were also analyzed as an indication of bioavailability. Overall, administration of Helaina rhLF by once daily oral gavage for 14 days was well tolerated in rats at levels up to 2000 mg/kg/day, or 57 × Helaina's intended commercial use in adults, and indicating that a high dose of 2000 mg/kg/day is appropriate for future definitive toxicology studies.",

Nevertheless, evaluating the proteoform heterogeneity, conformational stability, and activity of LTF remains challenging during its production and storage processes. In this study, we describe the implementation of native mass spectrometry (nMS), glycoproteomics, and an antimicrobial activity assay to assess the quality of LTF. We systematically characterize the purity, glycosylation heterogeneity, conformation, and thermal stability of LTF samples from different sources and transient high-temperature treatments by using nMS and glycoproteomics. Meanwhile, the nMS peak intensity and antimicrobial activity of LTF samples after heat treatment decreased significantly, and the two values were positively correlated. The nMS results provide essential molecular insights into the conformational stability and glycosylation heterogeneity of different LTF samples. Our results underscore the great potential of nMS for LTF quality control and activity evaluation in industrial production.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of incorporating various inactivated probiotic formulations, with or without recombinant lactoferrin (LF) expression, into a standard chow diet on metabolic-related disorders in obese mice. After inducing obesity through a 13-week high-fat diet followed by a standard chow diet, mice received daily oral administrations of different probiotics for 6 weeks using the oral gavage approach. These probiotic formulations consisted of a placebo (MRS), heat-inactivated Lactobacillus gasseri HM1 (HK-HM1), heat-killed LF-expression HM1 (HK-HM1/LF), sonication-killed HM1 (SK-HM1), and sonication-killed LF-expression HM1 (SK-HM1/LF). The study successfully induced obesity, resulting in worsened glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, the regular diet alone improved glucose tolerance, and the addition of inactivated probiotics further enhanced this effect, with SK-HM1/LF demonstrating the most noticeable improvement. However, while regular dietary intervention alone improved insulin sensitivity, probiotic supplementation did not provide additional benefits in this aspect. Inflammation in perirenal and epididymal fat tissues was partially alleviated by the regular diet and further improved by probiotics, particularly by SK-HM1, which showed the most significant reduction. Additionally, HK-HM1 and HK-HM1/LF supplements could contribute to the improvement of serum total triglycerides or total cholesterol, respectively. Overall, incorporating inactivated probiotics into a regular diet may enhance metabolic indices, and recombinant LF may offer potential benefits for improving glucose tolerance."

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin is widely found in milk and has the ability to bind iron. Previous studies have reported that lactoferrin was effective in the prevention and treatment of acute alcohol-induced liver injury (AALI). Ferroptosis is a recently discovered cell death and is involved in the development of AALI. However, the potential role of lactoferrin in acute alcohol-induced ferroptosis is still unclear. In this study, we observed that lactoferrin (10, 20, and 40 μg/mL) significantly mitigated alcohol (300 mM)-induced injury in vitro. Additionally, lactoferrin (100 and 200 mg/kg BW) significantly alleviated alcohol (4.8 g/kg BW)-induced injury in vivo. Our results showed that lactoferrin inhibited alcohol-induced upregulation of the ferroptosis marker protein ACSL4 and downregulation of GPX4. Meanwhile, lactoferrin treatment successfully reversed the elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the reduced glutathione (GSH) levels caused by alcohol treatment. These results may indicate that lactoferrin significantly decreased ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Lactoferrin has the potential to chelate iron, and our results showed that lactoferrin (20 μg/mL) significantly reduced iron ions and the expression of the ferritin heavy chain (FTH) under FeCl3 (100 μM) treatment. It was demonstrated that lactoferrin had a significant iron-chelating effect and reduced iron overload caused by FeCl3 in AML12 cells. Next, we examined iron content and the expression of iron metabolism marker proteins transferrin receptor (TFR), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), FTH, and ferroportin (FPN). Our results showed that lactoferrin alleviated iron overload induced by acute alcohol. The expression of TFR and DMT1 was downregulated, and FPN and FTH were upregulated after lactoferrin treatment in vivo and in vitro. Above all, the study suggested that lactoferrin can alleviate AALI by mitigating acute alcohol-induced ferroptosis. Lactoferrin may offer new strategies for the prevention or treatment of AALI.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a tumor with minimal chance of cure due to underlying liver diseases, late diagnosis, and inefficient treatments. Thus, HCC treatment warrants the development of additional strategies. Lactoferrin (Lf) is a mammalian multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein of the innate immune response and can be found as either a native low iron form (native-Lf) or a high iron form (holo-Lf). Bovine Lf (bLf), which shares many functions with human Lf (hLf), is safe for humans and has several anticancer activities, including chemotherapy boost in cancer. We found endogenous hLf is downregulated in HCC tumors compared with normal liver, and decreased hLf levels in HCC tumors are associated with shorter survival of HCC patients. However, the chemoprotective effect of 100% iron saturated holo-bLf on experimental hepatocarcinogenesis has not yet been determined. We aimed to evaluate the chemopreventive effects of holo-bLf in different HCC models. Remarkably, a single dose (200 mg kg-1) of holo-bLf was effective in preventing early carcinogenic events in a diethylnitrosamine induced HCC in vivo model, such as necrosis, ROS production, and the surge of facultative liver stem cells, and eventually, holo-bLf reduced the number of preneoplastic lesions. For an established HCC model, holo-bLf treatment significantly reduced HepG2 tumor burden in xenotransplanted mice. Finally, holo-bLf in combination with sorafenib, the advanced HCC first-line treatment, synergistically decreased HepG2 viability by arresting cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Our findings provide the first evidence suggesting that holo-bLf has the potential to prevent HCC or to be used in combination with treatments for established HCC.",
