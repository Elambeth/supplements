      "abstract": "Background: A nutritional supplement based on medicinal plants (saffron and ashwagandha), tryptophan, and vitamin B6 could contribute to alleviating/improving mood and associated disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential benefits of this combination supplement. During the study period, participants underwent a period of forced home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which represented an unexpected impact factor. Methods: This open-label prospective trial enrolled a cohort of female employees who reported mild to moderate anxiety. The primary objective was to evaluate changes in the level of anxiety using the adapted Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) after 12 weeks of regular supplementation with Safromotive (two tablets daily, for 12 weeks). The secondary objectives were to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and tolerability. Results: In total, 46 women with a mean age of 45.0 (6.5) years were included. A statistically significant improvement in HARS was observed, with a 7.5-unit decrease from baseline to 12 weeks (p  < 0.0001) and from 4 to 12 weeks of supplement intake (p=0.0058). However, no significant changes were found during the lockdown period (between weeks 8 and 12 of the study). No relationship was found between women's sociodemographic characteristics and the HARS total score. A significant reduction in the HRQoL questionnaire score of 1.2 units was observed between baselines and 12 weeks of treatment (p=0.0273). At the end of the study, 78.6% of the women reported consistency the supplement intake during the study course. Conclusion: This nutritional supplement composed of saffron, ashwagandha, tryptophan, and vitamin B6 appears to improve anxiety and HRQoL, but confinement could have impacted the evolution of the outcome.",

      "abstract": "Today, diabetes is considered a growing global epidemic. In the diabetic environment, a large amount of reactive oxygen species are produced. This type of active oxygen causes severe damage to cell membranes, proteins, and DNA. Therefore, finding a solution to deal with and reduce this type of reactive oxygen is very important. One of the most effective ways to deal with oxidative damage and inflammation is the modulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. One of the useful natural substances that can be used for treatment in the signaling system is saffron. In this article, research evaluating the medicinal effects of saffron and its compounds and their mechanisms of action, especially the Nrf2 signaling pathway, have been investigated and studied. The results show that saffron and its components have the potential to treat diabetes due to their unique properties.",

      "abstract": "The mutations observed in the various forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affect genes coding for rod-specific proteins and direct the progression of different forms of dystrophy toward total blindness. The present investigation aims to explore the protective effects of Saffron Repron®, in a mouse model of RP. Saffron was administered orally to pregnant females and weaned pups for 120 days. At different time points (P30, P60, P90, and P120), visual function, retinal function, cone lifespan, morphology, gene expression, and protein level were analyzed. The results indicate that chronic saffron treatment effectively slows the progression of long-term damage caused by genetic mutations in both the morphology and function of retinal neurons. Cellular mechanisms responsible for this action appear complex and, probably, due to coordinated and synergistic activities by its chemical components. Here we provide evidence that saffron is able to modulate the epigenetic pathway involved in neuroinflammation. Biochemical and molecular measures suggest that early saffron treatment may induce a form of adaptation known as acquired resilience."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The global prevalence of mental health disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, has increased significantly, with rates further elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conventional pharmacological treatments, while effective, often lead to side effects that can impact patient adherence and quality of life. This has driven interest in safer, natural adjunctive therapies. Crocus sativus L. (Iridaceae) (saffron) and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Lamiaceae) (scutellaria) have individually shown potential, in humans and animals, respectively, as mood regulators, with bioactive compounds that modulate neurotransmitter systems and possess anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic effects. This study aimed (1) to explore the efficacy and safety of scutellaria extracts in humans and (2) to test a possible synergistic effect when combining scutellaria and saffron on mood regulation in individuals experiencing mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 180 participants with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms were assigned to receive either scutellaria extract alone (SCUTELL'UP®), saffron extract alone (SAFFR'ACTIV®), a combination of scutellaria and saffron extracts (SAFFR'UP®), or a placebo for six weeks. The primary outcome was assessed using a standardized depression scale (Beck Depression Inventory). The secondary outcomes, including anxiety, emotional state, well-being level, and sleep quality, were all assessed using validated questionnaires. Safety and tolerability were evaluated throughout the study period. Results: The results confirmed the beneficial effects of saffron extract on depressive and anxious symptoms, as well as its role in improving sleep quality. For the first time in humans, scutellaria extract demonstrated a positive effect on mood regulation. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of the combination of these two extracts was identified, leading to enhanced improvements in depressive and anxious symptoms and emotional well-being among individuals with mild-to-moderate depression, compared to the placebo group. Minimal adverse effects were reported across all treatment groups. Conclusions: This natural adjunctive nutritional strategy offers a promising alternative for individuals seeking safer options for mental health support. Further research is warranted to exclude potential long-term side effects and to explore potential mechanisms of this combined supplementation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) cultivation faces increasing challenges from climate change and declining yields. Optimal corm development occurs at 15/6 °C day/night temperatures. However, climate change is forcing cultivation under higher temperature regimes.This study investigated the effects of Trichoderma harzianum Bi, nano-TiO2, and magnetic field treatments on saffron cormlet production under high-temperature greenhouse conditions (25/15 °C day/night, exceeding optimal temperatures by 10 °C), representing increasingly common stress conditions in traditional growing regions. While controlled environment production offers potential solutions, the combined effects of biological and physical treatments for mitigating high-temperature stress remain unexplored. METHODS: A factorial experiment examined T. harzianum Bi-enriched medium (0, 100% v/v), nano-TiO2 (0, 250, 500 μl l-1), and magnetic field exposure (0, 60 militesla, 30-min constant exposure) effects on uniform-sized saffron corms (13 ± 0.5 g) grown in cocopeat-perlite medium (3:1 v/v). Analysis included cormlet production parameters and comprehensive metabolic profiling of key compounds including carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids. RESULTS: Combined T. harzianum and 250 μl l-1 nano-TiO2 treatment significantly enhanced cormlet production, increasing individual cormlet weight by 68.9% (from 9.0 ± 0.2 to 15.2 ± 0.3 g/cormlet, p < 0.05) and improving key metabolites: starch (37.6% increase to 255.2 ± 20.4 mg g-1 FW), GABA (159.6% increase to 1.35 ± 0.11 μmol g-1 FW), and myoinositol (111.1% increase to 0.95 ± 0.08 mg g-1 FW). Magnetic field exposure increased cormlet numbers but reduced individual weights by 20%. Metabolomic analysis revealed coordinated enhancement of carbohydrate metabolism and stress-response pathways. CONCLUSION: For commercial production, we recommend applying combined T. harzianum (100% v/v medium enrichment) with 250 μl l-1 nano-TiO2 treatment under controlled greenhouse conditions (25/15 °C Day/night). This protocol consistently produces larger, more vigorous cormlets with enhanced metabolic profiles, though magnetic field applications require further optimization. These findings provide immediate practical strategies for addressing cultivation challenges under increasing temperature stress conditions, particularly relevant for commercial greenhouse production systems."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is considered a common underlying mechanism in many retinal degenerative diseases and is often associated with inflammation. The use of dietary supplements containing Saffron has beneficial effects in ocular diseases, though the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we investigated how Saffron can exert protective effects against oxidative damage in retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and whether its combination with Elderberry and Melilotus may have additive beneficial effects. ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with Saffron alone or in a mix containing Saffron, Elderberry and Melilotus, then exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 3 h. Afterwards, we evaluated cell viability, oxidative stress and inflammatory status. Our results showed that H2O2 reduced cell viability and total glutathione levels, while increasing caspase-3, caspase-1 and LDH activity. Moreover, H2O2 triggered ROS production, glutathione oxidation and IL-1β secretion. Pretreatments with Saffron alone or with the mix counteract these damaging effects by improving cell viability, reducing oxidative stress and enhancing SOD2 expression. Pretreatment with the mix activated the NRF2 pathway and was more effective than Saffron alone in preventing caspase-1 activation. These findings suggest that the combination of Saffron, Elderberry and Melilotus could have therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the detoxification effect of extracts from the petal of Crocus sativus L. (PCSE) on acetaminophen (APAP) induced liver injury in mice and its related mechanisms. LC-MS/MS analysis was used to identify the main components in PCSE, and an APAP-induced acute liver injury model in mice was constructed to evaluate the detoxification effect of PCSE. Liver tissue H&E staining, liver function indexes including ALT and AST, pro-inflammatory cytokine including TNF-α and IL-6, as well as hepatic tissue oxidative stress levels were examined. In addition, in vitro APAP induced cell was also prepared, apoptosis levels were detected by AO/EB staining, ROS fluorescence intensity was analyzed as well as the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and Nrf2/HO-1 pathway-related proteins were detected by western blot, to investigate the mechanism of PCSE's action in ameliorating liver injury. The results showed that PCSE can improve the survival rate of APAP induced mice, decrease ALT, AST, TNF-α and IL-6 levels, and ameliorate the liver injury induced by APAP. Furthermore, the mechanism research suggested PCSE attenuated oxidative stress and apoptosis in APAP-induced liver cells, as well as activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. In summary, PCSE possesses potential detoxification effects on APAP induced liver injury by inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis via regulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, which provides more possibilities for the drug selection for the treatment of liver injury in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of combining natural herbs like chamomile and saffron for the management of anxiety and depression. METHODS: A rodent model of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety, secondary to streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus was made. A total of 6 rat groups were chosen; healthy and diseased controls; and diseased test groups of fluoxetine, saffron, chamomile, and combined saffron and chamomile treated (n = 6/group). Activity by forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and correlations with biochemical markers like serum glucose, tryptophan, C-reactive protein (CRP), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 5-hydrox-ytryptamine 2C receptor (5HT2CR) expression, were assessed at the end of the 3rd week of the treatment. A one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test was applied. RESULTS: The combined herbal treatment group showed significantly better (P <0.05) than all other groups in terms of anti-hyperglycemic effect. All treatments improved the CRP levels; however, the combination group was also significantly better than fluoxetine and the individual herb groups. Only the herb groups showed efficacy in the FST with added benefits of the combination group over the healthy controls and similar trends in the EPMT. However, expression of 5HT2CR was repressed while BDNF was elevated through treatment. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in comparison to treatment with a SSRI, and individual herbs, the combination of chamomile and saffron showed overall improved outcomes.",

The multifaceted etiology of AD, which is not yet fully understood, includes genetic predispositions, immune dysfunctions(such as an impaired skin barrier and abnormal immune regulation), imbalances in the skin microbiota, and environmental factors, among others. In the field of AD treatment, the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine is becoming an emerging trend. Given the potenzial side effects and reduced efficacy of conventional therapeutic drugs, Chinese herbal medicines offer patients new treatment options because of their unique efficacy and low toxicity. Some saffron extracts derived from saffron and gardenia, such as crocin, crocetin, and safranal, have shown promising potenzial in the treatment of AD. These natural ingredients not only possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties similar to those of traditional Chinese medicines but also demonstrate excellent effects in promoting the repair of damaged skin barriers. Therefore, this article reviews the therapeutic potenzial of saffron extract in the treatment of AD, with a special focus on its mechanisms and potenzial interventions, while emphasizing the importance of herbal medicines as alternatives to traditional treatments, providing AD patients with safer and more effective treatment options."

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in accidents, sports, and warfare. Additionally, TBI imposes a significant financial burden on individuals and governments, necessitating substantial financial support. It also severely diminishes the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. TBI is consisted of two distinct phases: the primary and secondary phases. The primary phase consists of numerous events that occur immediately after the injury or concussion but the second phase takes times and include several of responsive cascades that human body express against TBI. After TBI incidence, several cellular and molecular pathways (inflammatory, apoptotic, anti-oxidant) will be dysregulated. Over the years, numerous therapeutic approaches have been implemented to treat this debilitating condition, aiming to alleviate its symptoms and complications, while enhancing patients' quality of life. Consequently, the search for more efficient with less adverse effects therapeutic methods remains a priority. One herbal medication that has recently garnered considerable attention is saffron. Data were collected from Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Cochrane Library for clinical, in vivo and in vitro studies published in English between 1992 and Jan 2025. Search terms included \"TBI\" OR \"Traumatic brain injury\" AND \"Saffron\" AND \"Safranal\" AND \"Crocin\" AND \"Crocetin\" AND \"Kaempferol\". The initial search yielded approximately 3,000 manuscripts. After screening and full-text evaluation, as detailed in the search methodology, ten experiments (in-vitro & in-vivo) were ultimately included. Saffron showed to modulate various signaling pathways and cytokines such as NF-kB, NLRP3, Nrf2, HO-1, Bcl2, and Bax, which will lead to the improvement of TBI sign and symptoms and increase the quality of life. It has been demonstrated that this compound could play a multifactorial role in TBI treatment such as reduction in inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, while modulating microglia activation. The findings suggest that saffron may play a pivotal role in treating TBI and mitigating its complications by regulating various pathophysiological pathways. However, more clinical trials are necessary to evaluate saffron's effectiveness in individuals diagnosed with TBI. Clinical trials should focus on various areas such as saffrons' safety profile, adverse effects, the exact mechanism of action, its' impact on acute and chronic TBI, rehabilitation, and long-term neuroprotection."

While changes in leaf composition during senescence have been extensively documented in various plants, similar studies on saffron remain unexplored. Furthermore, there has been no investigation into the potential role of melatonin in delaying leaf senescence in saffron. This study aimed to examine the changes in saffron leaf composition and evaluate the effects of melatonin foliar application during the late growth stage. The research was conducted over two consecutive cropping years (2020-2021 and 2021-2022). In the first experiment, five concentrations of melatonin (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μM) were applied as foliar sprays to assess their effects on fatty acid composition and plant greenness. The second experiment involved varying melatonin concentrations and two application timings (124 and 131 days after germination) to study their impact on antioxidant enzyme activity. Both experiments were designed as factorial trials within a completely randomized block design with three replicates. The results demonstrated that treatment with 100 μM melatonin significantly increased the production of fatty acids, including C8:0 (67.60 %), C10:0 (98.66 %), C12:0 (40.73 %), and C18:0 (35.32 %) compared to the untreated control. Also, the highest activities of ascorbate peroxidase and catalase enzymes were observed with 100 μM melatonin applied 124 days after germination. On the same day, the highest total protein content was recorded with 50 μM melatonin, although it was not significantly different from the 100 μM treatment. In conclusion, the 100 μM melatonin treatment was found to be the most effective in enhancing plant greenness, modifying fatty acid composition, boosting antioxidant enzyme activity, and increasing total protein content. However, the timing of melatonin application emerged as a critical factor warranting careful consideration. These findings highlight the promising role of melatonin in improving the physiological and biochemical attributes of saffron plants."

      "abstract": "Cataracts are significant causes of blindness, closely linked to prolonged hypercholesterolemia. While saffron has the potential for eye health, its effects on lens lesions remain understudied. This study aimed to investigate the effect of saffron on the lens changes in atherosclerotic-induced New Zealand white rabbits (NZWR). Thirty-five NZWRs were subjected to four to eight weeks of high-cholesterol diet to induce atherosclerosis, resulting in cataractous lens changes. The rabbits were categorised randomly into three groups: normal diet group, pre-treated group and treated group. The pre-treated group was divided into early atherosclerosis(HC4) and established atherosclerosis (HC8). The saffron-treated group was fed with the HCD diet followed by saffron treatment of 50mg/kg/day (TG450, TG840) and 100mg/kg/day (TG4100, TG8100) of saffron ethanolic extract (SEE) respectively. The normal diet group was given a normal diet over the 8 weeks. After completing the 16-week experimental protocol, the NZWR were euthanized, and their lenses were extracted for histopathological evaluation. The pre-treated group exhibited cataractous lens changes of grade 2, characterized by increased homogenisation, swollen lens fibers, and intracellular vacuolisation. Interestingly, these cataract changes showed a positive trend from grade 2 to grade 1 post-treatment with SEE. In the saffron-treated group, vacuoles and pinkish homogenised areas were reduced. Additionally, a uniform layer of anterior epithelium and decreased non-swollen lens fibers indicated significant cataract lesion improvement. The normal diet group displayed minimal to zero cataractous changes (Grade 0). HPLC analysis demonstrated the presence of crocin, crocetin, and picocrocin in the saffron ethanolic extract, with peak absorptions at 440nm (12.817min), 440nm (1.620min), and 254nm (6.553min) respectively. The phytochemical screening of saffron ethanolic extract was conducted and showed the presence of phytochemical compounds including saponins, flavonoids, tannins, and steroids. The positive effects on lenses in the TG groups could be due to crocin and crocetin, bioactive components of saffron, and its phytochemical compounds. This study highlights saffron's potential in managing cataract-induced conditions, emphasizing the importance of further research for its full therapeutic potential in cataract management.",

      "abstract": "Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) has held significant cultural and medicinal value since the Greek-Minoan civilization. As a triploid spice with vegetative propagation from the Iridaceae family, the three-branch style of C. sativus flowers, known as saffron, constitutes the most economically valuable part of the plant, renowned for its diverse medicinal properties. This study explores the in vitro induction of stigma-like structures (SLSs) from various explants of the Ghaen ecotype flower. The study found that the optimal sampling time for the majority of explants was the third week of October. Ovary explants exhibiting a prolonged response to hormonal treatments for the production of SLSs. Furthermore, intact, and injury ovary explants were found to be the most effective explant types for inducing SLSs. The explants were cultured on MS, 1/2MS, LS and B5 basal media supplemented with various combinations and concentrations of plant growth regulators. The results indicated that the B5 medium, enriched with 5-10 mg/ L BAP and 5-10 mg/ L NAA was the most effective treatment for inducing SLSs in all types of explants. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of saffron compounds in SLSs indicated similarities with natural saffron, albeit at significant lower concentrations: crocin (up to 10.2 mg/g), picrocrocin (up to 4.8 mg/g), and safranal (up to 9.7 mg/g). The highest accumulation of the three studied secondary metabolites was observed in the SLSs of style (24.4 mg/g), stigma (28.3 mg/g), and ovary (21.4 mg/g) explants, respectively. This study introduces a comprehensive procedure for producing SLSs containing the three most important metabolites of saffron for the first time.",

The efficacy of saffron extracts has been demonstrated in mild to moderate depression and in preclinical models of depression. However, evidence of saffron activity on reduced hedonic responsiveness and motivational anhedonia is limited. Since dopamine transmission dysfunctions are crucially involved in anhedonia and saffron seems to positively modulate dopamine release, we studied the potential antidepressant and anti-anhedonic effects of a standardized formulation of saffron extract in preclinical models of anhedonia-like behaviors, and patients diagnosed with unipolar or bipolar depression. We tested saffron activity in a rat model of stress-induced motivational anhedonia using sucrose self-administration protocols and investigated the molecular underpinnings of this effect focusing on DARPP-32 phosphorylation pattern in response to a reinforcer and BDNF-TrkB signaling, in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex. In parallel, with a pilot double-blind placebo-controlled study we investigated whether saffron add-on therapy reduced symptoms of depression and anhedonia, measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Repeated saffron administration restored motivation and reactivity to reward-associated cues in anhedonic rats, likely modulating dopaminergic transmission and BDNF-TrkB signaling. In depressed patients, an 8-week saffron add-on therapy induced a global improvement in depressive symptoms and a significant reduction in anhedonia. The study supports a pro-motivational effect of saffron and suggests a potentially useful saffron-based augmentation strategy in anhedonic patients, albeit with limitations due to small sample size and short trial duration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Relatively few studies have explored the impact of biofertilizers on the qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron despite its global agricultural and medical importance. This study aimed to evaluate the physiological and phytochemical responses of saffron to potassium (K), phosphorus (P), and iron-zinc (Fe-Zn) biofertilizers over 2 consecutive years (2022-2023). The treatments included single and combined applications of K, P, and Fe-Zn biofertilizers containing active bacterial inoculum, along with a control group, resulting in a total of eight treatments. Biofertilizers were applied at a rate of 0.5 L per hectare by fertigation in mid-February. Flowering began in mid-November in both 2022 and 2023, lasting approximately 3 weeks, during which data were collected. RESULTS: The highest flower count (3.5 times greater than the control group), longest flowering duration (2.4 times longer than the control group), greatest stigma dry weight (3.2 times higher than the control group), and highest flowering rate (1.2 times greater than the control group) were recorded in the second year application of the K + Fe-Zn treatment. The K + Fe-Zn treatment also enhanced quality traits significantly, including total phenolic content (1.11 g kg-1; an increase of 1.1 times relative to the control), anthocyanin (977 mg kg-1, an increase of 8.4 times), crocin (126.9 g kg-1, an increase of 1.2 times), picrocrocin (59.8 g kg-1, an increase of 1.2 times), and safranal (1.8 g kg-1, an increase of 3.3 times). CONCLUSION: Overall, the 2 year application of K + Fe-Zn solubilizing bacteria as biofertilizer improved both the qualitative and quantitative traits of saffron markedly, underscoring its potential importance in sustainable saffron cultivation in mineral-fortified soils. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Light is an essential environmental regulator of plant growth, development, and metabolism. With the popularization of customized light-emitting diode (LED) light sources in facility agriculture, accurate light control has become essential for regulating crop yield and quality. In this study, white, red, and blue LED lights were applied to extend the photoperiod at the start and end of the day during the indoor stage of saffron cultivation. We investigated saffron growth and flowering using non-target metabolomic and transcriptome analyses to determine the flux and accumulation of metabolites from the stigma under different light treatments. RESULTS: The results revealed that supplemental red and white lights both promoted dry mass accumulation in the stigma, with the optimal appearance achieved using white light. Supplemental white light promoted saffron flowering, whereas supplemental blue light delayed it. Supplemental blue light promoted crocin-1 and crocin-3 accumulation, whereas supplemental red light promoted crocin-2 accumulation. Expression analysis of key genes and their correlations with crocin-related metabolites may provide useful information for screening functional genes involved in crocin synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides useful information for future application of LED light to improve the planting technology, quality, and yield of saffron, and reveals underlying molecular information for the further research.",

Saffron is the dried stigma of Crocus sativus L., which is used in traditional medicine as an aphrodisiac. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects of saffron extract (SE) on LOH using an aging mouse model and Leydig cells. METHODS: The potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets of SE for the treatment of LOH were first identified using network pharmacology. An aging model was induced in mice by administration of D-galactose, followed by treatment with varying concentrations of SE. Subsequent assessments of serum testosterone levels, semen quality, testicular aging, oxidative stress, and apoptotic markers were performed to assess the impact of SE and to elucidate its mechanisms. In addition, in vitro experiments assessed the effect of SE on Leydig cell viability, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. RESULTS: The results showed that SE could modulate the PI3K-Akt-Nrf2 signaling pathway, enhancing Leydig cell resistance to oxidative stress and reducing Leydig cell apoptosis, thereby improving Leydig cell function and alleviating the decrease in serum testosterone associated with aging. CONCLUSION: Saffron is a promising strategy for the treatment of LOH and provides an effective approach to alleviate serum testosterone decline in older men.",

Despite a large number of studies examining the impact of saffron supplementation on OS, inflammation, and renal and liver function parameters, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been conducted to compile the outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). OBJECTIVE: The current systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of saffron or crocin intake on OS, inflammation, and renal and liver function parameters in patients with T2DM. DATA SOURCES: Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched up to December 2023. DATA EXTRACTION: The mean differences and their respective SDs were extracted. Using a random-effects model, the pooled data were calculated as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. DATA ANALYSIS: 17 eligible randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled findings showed that saffron supplementation remarkably decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (SMD: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.69 to -0.05; I2 = 40.77%, P = .15), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (SMD: -0.38; 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.10; I2 = 0%, P = .68), and malondialdehyde (MDA) (SMD: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.07; I2= 20.51%, P = .02) compared with the control. In addition, based on subgroup analyses, taking ≥100 mg of saffron daily in individuals with T2DM reduced the serum levels of IL-6 (SMD: -0.50; 95% CI: -0.90 to -0.10; I2 = 0%, P = .50) and MDA (SMD: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.03; I2 = 0, P = .97). Furthermore, the level of alanine transaminase was decreased (SMD: -0.43; 95% CI: -0.73 to -0.12; I2 = 0, P = .66) with a treatment period of <60 days of saffron or crocin supplementation. CONCLUSION: Larger studies with more follow-up and higher doses of both saffron and crocin are needed in order to understand the efficacy and safety of these herbs for long-term use as routine therapies.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of saffron petal extract-enriched diet on egg quality, blood metabolites and odorous gas emission from excreta in laying hens. METHODS: The experimental methodology involved a feeding trial conducted over a period of 12 weeks, using 200 Hy-line W36 laying hens aged 39 weeks. The dietary intervention included a basic diet (serving as a control with no supplementation), as well as diets fortified with 40, 60 or 80 parts per million (ppm) of hydroalcoholic saffron petal extract in a completely randomized design. RESULTS: Results showed that the inclusion of saffron petal extract in the diet did not significantly affect the egg crude protein, fat and ash content. However, a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in yolk cholesterol concentration was observed. No substantial effect was noted on feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and egg weight (p > 0.05). On the other hand, a significant increase (p < 0.05) was documented in the egg production percentage of hens fed on the 80 ppm saffron petal extract diet compared to the control. Furthermore, saffron petal extract supplementation resulted in a significantly lower yolk cholesterol together with reduced serum cholesterol content (p < 0.05). Blood glucose and triglyceride concentrations also demonstrated a decrease subsequent to the inclusion of 80 ppm saffron petal extract. The excretion of faecal minerals did not show any significant alterations due to the dietary interventions (p > 0.05). Notably, hens supplemented with 60 and 80 ppm saffron petal extract displayed significantly diminished concentrations of faecal ammonia (NH3) emissions (p < 0.05) compared to the control. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that the inclusion of 80 ppm saffron petal extract in the diet of laying hens may serve as a functional food source to mitigate cholesterol levels in egg yolk and blood serum, as well as to reduce faecal ammonia emissions.",

      "abstract": "This research aimed to assess the influence of ultrasound at a frequency of 37 kHz on various parameters of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) plants, including flowering efficiency, morphological, and textural properties, corm surface microbial population, and the concentrations of key secondary metabolites in saffron stigmas. Ultrasound was applied to saffron corms during two distinct growth stages, namely flower induction and flower initiation, utilizing varying sonication durations (0, 15, 30, and 60 min). Notably, flowering efficiency experienced a significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) after 60 min of sonication compared to the control at both stages. In contrast, an increase in sonication time from 0 (control) to 15 and 30 min resulted in a noteworthy augmentation in the number of flowers and flowering efficiency. The structural morphology of corms did not exhibit significant alterations under ultrasound at different durations within each stage. Extended exposure time showed efficacy in diminishing microbial population on corm surfaces and reinforcing corm resistance against compressive forces. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of saffron stigmas revealed that a significant increase in crocin content compared to the control at both stages, a trend that persisted with increasing sonication time up to 60 min. However, picrocrocin and safranal contents exhibited a decrease in both stages with prolonged sonication. These findings imply that ultrasound not only impacts the flowering efficiency of saffron corms but also exerts an influence the concentrations of secondary metabolites in the resultant stigma."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing worldwide, and there is growing interest in the potential use of natural compounds as an alternative treatment for managing DM. Several research studies have investigated the impact of saffron consumption on managing and improving metabolic profiles in patients with DM, and they have shown promising results. OBJECT: The study aims to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the potential effects of saffron and its extract on cardiometabolic indicators in diabetic and prediabetic overweight patients. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar for all relevant studies published before April 20, 2024. We extracted weighted (WMD) or standardized (SMD) mean differences (before-after) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of the outcomes and conducted meta-analyses using R. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024538380). RESULTS: Out of the studies screened, 15 RCTs were selected for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis. These studies collectively involved 869 participants, 438 in the intervention group and 431 in the control group. Notably, our results showed that saffron supplementation led to significant changes in FBS (MD: - 8.75 mg/dL, 95% CI [- 14.75; - 2.76], P < 0.01), HbA1C (MD: - 0.34%, 95% CI [- 0.39; - 0.9], P < 0.01), TG (MD: - 13.28 mg/dL, 95% CI [- 22.82; - 3.75], P < 0.01), SBP (MD: - 5.33 mmHg, 95% CI [- 8.99-1.67], P = 0.04), DBP (MD: - 1.02 mmHg, 95% CI [- 3.91; 1.86], P = 0.03), AST (MD: - 1.32 IU/L, 95% CI [- 1.72, - 0.93], P < 0.01) levels in T2DM patients compared to placebo or no supplementation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic intervention. However, there was no significant effect on Insulin secretion (MD: - 0.15 µU/ml, 95% CI [- 2.1763; 1.8689], P = 0.88), HOMA (MD: - 0.35%, 95% CI [- 1.34;0.63], P = 0.48), TC (MD: - 4.86 mg/dL, 95% CI [- 9.81-0.09], P = 0.54), HDL (MD: 0.18 mg/dL, 95% CI [- 0.93; 1.29], P = 0.74), LDL (MD: - 1.77 mg/dL, 95% CI [- 5.99-2.45], P = 0.41), TNF-α (MD: - 0.34 pg/mL, 95% CI [- 0.99-0.30], P = 0.29), creatinine (MD: 2.83 mg/dL, 95% CI [2.29, 3.37], P = 0.31) and BUN (MD: - 0.44 mg/dL, 95% CI [- 1.43, 0.55], P = 0.38). CONCLUSION: Saffron may improve specific CMI indices in overweight patients with diabetes or prediabetes, including significant reductions in FBS, HbA1C, TG, SBP, and AST. However, it did not significantly affect HDL, TC, LDL, insulin secretion, HOMA, DBP, TNF-α, ALT, Cr, or BUN. Further research with more trials and extended follow-up periods is needed to confirm and expand these findings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Contamination is not surprising in light of the ubiquitous nature of the fungi that produce aflatoxin and ochratoxin A. The presence of these toxins in the broiler diet leads to increased losses, an increased feed conversion ratio, and decreased productivity. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of the use of hydroalcoholic extracts of saffron petals, yeast cell walls and bentonite in the diets of broiler chickens contaminated with aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A. METHODS: In a completely randomised design, 350 one-day-old Ross 308 broilers were allocated into seven treatment groups and five replications: a negative control diet (without toxins or additives), a positive control diet (2.5 mg/kg aflatoxin + 2 mg/kg ochratoxin A (mg/kg) and diets containing toxins with a commercial toxin binder or yeast cell wall, processed bentonite or saffron petal extract alone or together. RESULTS: Compared with those in the positive control treatment, the relative weights of the carcasses, breasts and drumsticks improved with the addition of toxic adsorbent compounds (p < 0.05). Compared with the control treatment, the inclusion of a toxin binder had a significant effect on the concentration of glucose (p < 0.05). The concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase enzymes in the yeast cell wall + processed bentonite + saffron petal extract treatment were lower than those in the other treatments (p < 0.05). Toxin adsorbent compounds significantly improved the morphology of the small intestine in chickens fed contaminated diets (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The inclusion of toxic adsorbent compounds can reduce the negative effects caused by the presence of Aflatoxin B1 and Ocratoxin A. Saffron petal extract can potentially be used to modulate diets contaminated with Aflatoxin B1 and Ocratoxin A, which is best achieved with 750 mg/kg saffron petal extract along with 0.1% yeast cell wall extract and 1% processed bentonite.",

      "abstract": "The anticancer, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties of carotenoids from saffron or apocarotenoids (e.g., crocin, safranal, crocetin, and picrocrocin) have prompted research into their benefits. Apocarotenoids seem to be effective compound for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, cancer, respiratory, and metabolic disorders. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells that participates in the biosynthesis of proteins, lipids, and steroid hormones. Given the role of the ER in the regulation of several fundamental biological processes, including metabolic pathways and immune responses, aberrant ER function can have a significant influence on these vital processes and result in serious pathological consequences. Exposure of cell to adverse environmental challenges, such as toxic agents, ischemia, and so on, causes accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, also called ER stress. There is a growing evidence to suggest that ER disturbance in the form of oxidative/nitrosative stress and subsequent apoptotic cell death plays major roles in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, and liver diseases. Apocarotenoids with their unique properties can modulate ER stress through PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP (protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2α/activating transcription factor 4/C/EBP /homologous protein) and X-Box Binding Protein 1/activating transcription factor 6 (XBP1/ATF6) pathways. In addition, they suppress apoptosis through inhibition of endoplasmic and mitochondrial-dependent caspase cascade and can stimulate SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1) and Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) expression, thereby leading to protection against oxidative stress. This review summarizes the potential benefits of apocarotenoids in various ER-stress-related disorders."

However, bacterial infections caused by Aeromonas species pose a challenge. Antibiotics are crucial for disease control, but multidrug resistance is a global concern. Eco-friendly disease management methods, like saffron, have been identified as potential treatments. AIM: The study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with Saffron on Nile tilapia's growth performance, immune response, and disease resistance. METHODS: 180 fish were acclimatized for 2 weeks and randomly allocated into three groups. The first group served as a control, while the other two groups were fed a basal diet supplemented with Saffron at 1.5 g/kg (T1) and 0.5 g/kg (T2), respectively, for 12 weeks. Biochemical blood parameters. Histopathology and immunohistochemical studies were performed on the gills, liver, and spleen tissues. RESULTS: Following the feeding trial with Saffron supplement, especially at higher levels enhanced weight gain, Growth performance, plasma total protein, and globulin showed higher levels in fish groups with dietary with Saffron at 1.5 g/kg (T1) and 0.5 g/kg (T2) than in fish fed the control diet Regulate the immune response in lysozyme activity and immunoglobulin M (IgM). Regeneration of gills, liver, and spleen tissues was noticed Furthermore, saffron-treated organs exhibited immunoreactivity to TNF-α was mostly seen in the liver and gills, although it was also somewhat in the kidney and spleen and CD68, the group were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila, improved its defenses against A. hydrophila, immunity, and disease resistance than the control group. CONCLUSION: The results showed that saffron supplementation significantly increased the survival rate of fish challenged with A. hydrophila. It also enhanced the immune response of fish, as evidenced by increased levels of serum immunoglobulins and lysozyme activity. These findings suggest that saffron supplementation could be a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in aquaculture.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) leads to impaired vision and potential blindness. Globally, it accounts for approximately 9% of vision loss cases, and a projected 288 million individuals will be affected by 2040. Current treatments have limitations such as variable effectiveness, high costs, and potential side effects. Additionally, atrophic ARMD management remains challenging. As saffron has shown promising neuroprotective and antioxidant effects by potentially delaying disease progression, this study aims to review the mechanistic, pre-clinical, and clinical evidence of the effects, safety, and tolerability of saffron in ARMD treatment. METHODS: The Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles was applied in this narrative review. To find relevant literature, the syntax \"(saffron OR crocus) AND (retin* OR \"geographic atrophy\" OR \"choroidal neovascular*\" OR \"macular degeneration\")\" was searched in PubMed/MEDLINE. Pre-clinical and clinical original investigations of the effects of saffron in ARMD along with the eligible studies cited in their reference lists were identified and included. RESULTS: Saffron and its active compounds, crocin and crocetin, have shown promising results in improving visual function and delaying ARMD progression. Several clinical studies have found that daily supplementation with 20-50 mg of saffron or 5-15 mg of crocin for 3-12 months significantly improved best-corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and retinal function as measured by electroretinogram and microperimetry, with benefits observed in both dry and wet forms of ARMD. The effects were independent of genetic risk factors and maintained during the follow-up periods, suggesting the potential role of saffron as a long-term treatment option. Saffron reduces ARMD progression via anti-angiogenic, neuroprotective, and antioxidant mechanisms. Moreover, saffron is safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Although further research is needed to confirm long-term safety and efficacy, current evidence supports the use of saffron or crocin supplements as a safe and tolerable adjunct therapy for ARMD management."

      "abstract": "Saffron, similar to numerous other agricultural commodities, is susceptible to microbial contamination during cultivation and postharvest handling. Cold plasma treatment has emerged as an effective method for microbial inactivation while preserving food quality. The aim of this research was to preserve the color integrity and minimize the presence of microorganisms in dried saffron stigma by implementing cold plasma pre-treatment. Process parameters were optimized using the response surface method (RSM), considering the type of atmosphere (argon and air), plasma exposure time (1, 5, and 10 min), and plasma power (40, 70, and 100 W) as independent variables. The objectives were to maximize crocin content and minimize the total microbial load. The analysis of the response surface revealed that the argon atmosphere had a more significant impact on reducing microbial contamination than air, and an increase in plasma exposure time led to a decrease in microbial load. The maximum reduction in microbial load, by 0.9 logarithmic cycles compared to the control, was achieved with a 10-min treatment at 40 W power. Extended plasma exposure durations led to a minor reduction in the color, taste, aroma, and antioxidant properties of saffron stigma. Specifically, the color, taste, and aroma decreased by 0.5%, 0.5%, and 0.08%, respectively, with longer plasma exposure times. The antioxidant activity decreased by 0.64% with prolonged exposure time. However, the plasma-treated samples did not show any signs of Escherichia coli, mold, or yeast. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that the type of atmosphere significantly influenced the reduction of infection and maintenance of saffron stigma's color quality. Cold plasma pretreatment holds promise as a viable method for preserving the physicochemical attributes of saffron while effectively reducing microbial contamination."

There is increasing interest in exploring food industry waste as a source of bioactive molecules with healthcare applications. In this study, a co-culture system of Caco-2 cells and PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages was used to simulate the human intestinal microenvironment. Inflammation was induced using TNF-α and IFN-γ, followed by treatment with Saffron Petal Extract (SPE). The results demonstrated that SPE significantly attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, and IL-6 via modulation of the NF-κB pathway. Given that NF-κB is a key regulator of macrophage-driven inflammation, our findings support further investigation of SPE as a potential complementary therapeutic agent for IBD treatment."

      "abstract": "Crocus sativus L. is a widely cultivated traditional plant for obtaining dried red stigmas known as \"saffron,\" the most expensive spice in the world. The response of C. sativus to pre-sowing processing of corms with cold plasma (CP, 3 and 5 min), vacuum (3 min), and electromagnetic field (EMF, 5 min) was assessed to verify how such treatments affect plant performance and the quality and yield of herbal raw materials. The results show that applied physical stressors did not affect the viability of corms but caused stressor-dependent changes in the kinetics of sprouting, growth parameters, leaf trichome density, and secondary metabolite content in stigmas. The effect of CP treatment on plant growth and metabolite content was negative, but all stressors significantly (by 42-74%) increased the number of leaf trichomes. CP3 treatment significantly decreased the length and dry weight of flowers by 43% and 60%, respectively, while EMF treatment increased the length of flowers by 27%. However, longer CP treatment (5 min) delayed germination. Vacuum treatment improved the uniformity of germination by 28% but caused smaller changes in the content of stigma compounds compared with CP and EMF. Twenty-six compounds were identified in total in Crocus stigma samples by the HPLC-DAD method, including 23 crocins, rutin, picrocrocin, and safranal. Processing of Crocus corms with EMF showed the greatest efficiency in increasing the production of secondary metabolites in saffron. EMF increased the content of marker compounds in stigmas (crocin 4: from 8.95 to 431.17 mg/g; crocin 3: from 6.27 to 164.86 mg/g; picrocrocin: from 0.4 to 1.0 mg/g), although the observed effects on growth were neutral or slightly positive. The obtained findings indicate that treatment of C. sativus corms with EMF has the potential application for increasing the quality of saffron by enhancing the amounts of biologically active compounds.",

      "abstract": "This work represents the first successful application of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based electrochemical sensor for the sensitive and selective determination of the first developed proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (BOR). BOR is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and mantle cell lymphoma. It shows its desired effect through the boronate group and can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. The MIP-based electrochemical sensor design includes the integration of green-synthesized saffron-based copper nanoflowers (CuNFs) from Crocus sativus L. to increase the active surface area and porosity of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface. 2-Acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) was selected as the functional monomer along with other MIP components. Detailed characterizations of the developed CuNFs/AMPS/MIP-GCE sensor and CuNFs were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The indirect measurement approach using 5.0 mM [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- solution was used to determine BOR in the linear range of 2.5 × 10-13 M - 2.5 × 10-12 M (0.25-2.5 pM). The LOD and LOQ values of the sensor obtained at the fM level (29 fM and 96.7 fM), which has a linear response in the commercial human serum sample in the same concentration range, emphasize its sensitivity (1.89 × 1013 and 2.14 × 1013 μA/M for standard solution and serum). The repeatability and reproducibility of the sensor were between 0.87 % and 2.17 %, showing its reliability. The successful performance of the sensor in the presence of metabolites belonging to BOR demonstrates its unique selectivity. The selectivity was demonstrated via relative imprinting factor (IF') values (higher than 3.5) against BOR's metabolites. The stability of the CuNFs/AMPS/MIP-GCE sensor was found to be 5 days.",

      "abstract": "During ageing, the brain is vulnerable to a growing imbalance of the antioxidant defence system, resulting in increased oxidative stress. This condition may be mainly responsible for cognitive decline, resulting in synaptic transmission disruptions and the onset of neuronal dysfunction. In this context, developing efficient preventive and therapeutic strategies against increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defence mechanisms should be considered a public health priority to promote healthy ageing. Therefore, the current study explored the benefits of a novel combination of green tea, saffron, trans-Reveratrol, and citicoline, called MIX, on improving intracellular processes to ameliorate the mechanisms linked to cognitive decline under oxidative stress conditions. First, the ability of MIX to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated in an in vitro model, analysing TEER value and the specific tight junctions; second, the CCF-STTG1 cell line was pretreated with 200 µM H2O2 for 30 min to explore the effects of the single active compounds and their combination under oxidative stress conditions. Our results demonstrated for the first time the synergistic effects of the new combination to improve the absorption rate of individual agents through the BBB and maintain its integrity. Subsequently, further research was done to assess the positive role of the combination to counteract oxidative damage; as expected, MIX restored the neurodegenerative state activated by 200 µM H2O2, reducing mitochondrial damage, and improving survival pathways. Additionally, MIX acted as a regulator of both cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis, reducing the inflammatory state activated by oxidative stress. Finally, MIX can balance neurotrophin production to prevent mitochondrial disruption. In conclusion, MIX counteracted the adverse effects of brain oxidative stress, suggesting that this new proposed formulation prevents the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of cognitive decline, even in support of conventional therapy.",

      "abstract": "Water stress is one of the most significant abiotic stresses that disrupts the osmotic balance of plants and consequently reduces their growth and performance. In recent years, it has been found that serotonin, as a signaling and regulatory molecule, can play important roles in the growth and development of plants and enhance their tolerance to abiotic stresses. Saffron is a plant known for its medicinal and culinary properties. Its distinct flavor, aroma, and vibrant color make it a sought-after ingredient in various cuisines and traditional medicines. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible effect of serotonin growth regulator on some morphophysiological and biochemical characteristics of saffron plant under water stress conditions. Water stress was applied using polyethylene glycol 6000 at a level of 30%, w/v. Serotonin was also applied exogenously at a concentration of 100 µM in both foliar and root applications. The experimental findings demonstrated that water stress had a detrimental impact on various growth and photosynthetic parameters including FW, DW, SH, RWC, photosynthetic pigments content, Pn, Fv/Fm, C and Ci. Under these conditions, H2O2 content and ion leakage increased. The increase in the content of proline and sugars also confirmed that the saffron plant was placed in unfavorable growth conditions. Serotonin application in both foliar and root applications and especially root treatment under stressful conditions improved plant growth by activating enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Overall, the exogenous application of serotonin increased the resistance of saffron plants to water stress.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a significant mental health challenge globally. While traditional antidepressants are effective, they often have unwanted side effects. Saffron, a natural spice derived from Crocus sativus L., has emerged as a potential alternative therapy for depression. Researchers have found that its components such as crocin, crocetin, and safranal have been found to mitigate depressive symptoms through neurotransmitter regulation, anti-inflammatory effects, and neuroprotection. Clinical trials suggest that the effectiveness of saffron in treating mild to moderate depression is comparable to that of standard medications, and animal studies support these results, showing behavioral improvements with saffron treatment. Saffron is particularly appealing due to its safety and lower incidence of side effects, making it suitable for those sensitive to conventional drugs. Additionally, its antioxidant properties may offer further health benefits. However, challenges such as determining the appropriate dosage, prohibitive cost, and the limited availability of quality saffron need to be addressed. Most research on saffron's efficacy is short-term; thus, long-term studies are essential to understand its full therapeutic potential and ongoing antidepressant effects. While saffron is safe in terms of its culinary value, higher therapeutic doses require careful monitoring for drug interactions and side effects. In summary, saffron represents a promising direction in depression treatment, with benefits potentially matching those of standard treatments and a better safety profile. However, further research is necessary to establish clear guidelines for its use, optimize dosing, and assess long-term outcomes. Saffron offers a natural treatment path for depression, but its use must be controlled and supported by scientific evidence.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Saffron is derived from the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L., which was considered by ancient nations for food and medicinal purposes. In traditional medicine, the therapeutic use of Crocus sativus includes antispasmodic, antitussive and expectorant. AIM OF THE STUDY: Mitochondrial fusion, fission, biogenesis, and mitophagy are essential processes for maintaining mitochondrial dynamics in response to cellular stress. The primary objective of this research was to examine how crocin affected the levels of important mitochondrial regulators, including Drp1, Pgc1α, Nrf1, and Mfn2, in the lung tissue of ovalbumin-sensitized mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of fifty male BALB/C mice were randomly assigned to five unique groups (n = 10 for each group), including the control group, ovalbumin-sensitized group (OVA), OVA group treated with 30 mg/kg of crocin, OVA group treated with 60 mg/kg of crocin, and OVA group treated with 1 mg/kg of dexamethasone. Post-sensitization and ovalbumin challenge, mice lung tissues were evaluated for the expression of Drp1, Pgc1α, Nrf1, and Mfn2 mRNA levels using real-time PCR as well as histopathological assessments. RESULTS: In the OVA group, there was a significant elevated in inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes; however, crocin (both concentrations) and dexamethasone intervention showed significant inhibitory effects (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001). Moreover, an increase in the expression of Drp1, Pgc1α, and Nrf1 levels was seen in the OVA group, while crocin and dexamethasone showed protective benefits (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). Furthermore, the levels of Mfn2 were reduced in the lung tissue of mice exposed to ovalbumin, but this decrease was reversed by crocin 60 (P < 0.05) and dexamethasone treatment (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In mice with OVA sensitization, the balance of mitochondrial dynamics in lung tissue was disrupted, but intervention of crocin identified to have a protective effect.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Saffron is one of the traditional medicinal herbs, which contains various active ingredients, such as safranal, crocin, saffron acid, etc. It has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties, and is widely used in clinical practice. The anti-cancer efficacy of saffron has been previously confirmed, but its anti-cancer mechanism in colorectal cancer remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of active compounds of saffron on the efficacy of immunotherapy for colorectal cancer. METHODS: TCMSP and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS), GeneCards, and DisGeNET databases were used to identify the active compounds of saffron, drug targets and the disease targets of colorectal cancer. They were then subjected to Gene Ontology Enrichment (GO) and Signalling Pathway Enrichment (KEGG) analyses. The core targets and corresponding compounds were selected for molecular docking. The effect of active components of saffron on the proliferation of CT26 and HCT116 cells was investigated using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). In vitro experiments were conducted by subcutaneous injection of CT26 cells to establish a colon cancer model. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting (WB), real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and flow cytometry (FCM) were employed to validate the effects of saffron on colorectal cancer immunotherapy. RESULTS: 1. LC-MS analysis revealed that the main active component of saffron extract was crocin. The active chemicals of saffron intersected with 170 colorectal cancer targets, with 17 predicting targets for saffron treatment. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the active components of saffron can prevent colorectal cancer development by enhancing Th17 cell differentiation and the IL-17 signaling pathway. 2. In vitro studies revealed that saffron alcohol extract, crocin, and safranal can suppress the proliferation of CT26 and HCT116 cells. 3. In vivo studies showed that crocin and safranal can increase the body mass and decrease the tumor mass of loaded mice, decrease the serum level of IL-17, and lower the mRNA expression level of IL-17, IL-6, TNF-α, TGF-β, and PD-L1 and IL-17, PD-L1 protein in tumors. This inhibitory effect was strengthened after combined immunotherapy. In addition, saffron modulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and the CD4+/CD8+T ratio in mouse spleens. CONCLUSION: The active components of saffron can reduce the expression of inflammatory factors and ameliorate the immunological microenvironment of tumors via the IL-17 signaling pathway, thereby improving the efficacy of immunotherapy for colorectal cancer. This study provides pharmacological support for the application of saffron in enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy for colorectal cancer.",

In this meta-analysis, the preclinical evidence and potential mechanism of saffron were explored in an animal model of ovalbumin-induced asthma. METHODS: Studies related to saffron and its constituents in an animal model of ovalbumin-induced asthma from the beginning to March 2024 were searched from Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the 15-item CAMARADES checklist. Data analysis was performed using STATA software version 17. RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 536 animals (268 animals in the intervention group and 268 animals in the ovalbumin-induced group) were analyzed. The meta-analysis findings demonstrated that saffron and its constituents played a significant role in reducing total WBC, eosinophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts. Moreover, saffron showed a significant decrease in the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IgE, histamine, endothelin, nitric oxide, and nitrite. Moreover, saffron was found to elevate EC50 thresholds and lower maximum response rates in experimental animals. The analysis revealed a significant identification of modulation in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and miRNAs pathways. CONCLUSION: Saffron and its components may impact ovalbumin-induced asthma model in animals through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory pathways, as well as improving pulmonary function and modulating ER stress markers and miRNAs pathways. As a result, saffron should be considered for further clinical trials in individuals suffering from asthma."

SAFFRON-104 (NCT03941873) was a multicohort phase Ib/II study investigating sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC). METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced HCC or GC/GEJC. Phase I determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab. Phase II evaluated sitravatinib monotherapy in patients with pretreated HCC, and sitravatinib plus tislelizumab in anti-PD-(L)1-naïve or -treated HCC and anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC. Primary endpoints were safety/tolerability (phase I) and objective response rate (ORR) (phase II). RESULTS: At data cutoff (March 31, 2023), 111 patients were enrolled; 102 were efficacy-evaluable (median study follow-up 9.1 months [range: 0.7-36.9]). The RP2D of sitravatinib was determined as 120 mg orally once daily. In patients receiving sitravatinib monotherapy and sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab, grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (51.9%) and 42 (50.0%) patients, respectively. The ORR was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-49.1) in patients with pretreated HCC receiving sitravatinib monotherapy. In patients receiving sitravatinib with tislelizumab, the ORR was 11.5% (95% CI 2.4-30.2) with anti-PD-(L)1-naïve HCC, 9.5% (95% CI 1.2-30.4) with anti-PD-(L)1-treated HCC, and 16.1% (95% CI 5.5-33.7) in patients with anti-PD-(L)1-naïve GC/GEJC. CONCLUSIONS: Sitravatinib with/without tislelizumab was generally well tolerated and showed preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced HCC and GC/GEJC.",

      "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex process orchestrated by interactions between a variety of cell types, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, and bioactive factors such as extracellular matrix (ECM) components, growth factors, and cytokines. Chronic wounds exhibit delayed proliferative phase initiation, reduced angiogenesis, impaired ECM synthesis, and persistent inflammatory response. Chronic wounds are one of the main challenges to the healthcare system worldwide, with a high cost for medical services. Hence, investigation of new approaches to accelerate wound healing is essential. Phytomedicines are considered as potential agents for improving the wound healing by accelerating epithelization, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis. These natural compounds have various advantages including availability, ease of application, and high effectiveness in wound managment. This study aimed to investigate the biological effects of saffron or Crocus sativus L. (C. sativus) petal extract on cell survival, migration, and angiogenesis using MTT, scratch and in vitro tube formation assays. Moreover, the expression of collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were evaluated in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF)s and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)s, respectively. The effect of the C. sativus extract on the skin of diabetic mice was also monitored. The results showed that C. sativus petal extract promoted the viability and migration of HDFs and HUVECs. Moreover, C. sativus petal extract enhanced the formation of tube-like structures by HUVECs cultured on the Matrigel basement membrane matrix, indicating its potential to stimulate angiogenesis. Gene expression studies have shown the the C. sativus extract increases wound healing by upregulation of COL1A1 and VEGF, which are crucial factors involved in collagen deposition, epithelialization, and angiogenesis. Histological analysis revealed that C. sativus petal extract enhanced vascularity and increased the number of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis, ultimately accelerating wound closure compared to wounds treated with eucerin and commercial ointment in diabetic mice. Therefore, C. sativus petal extract has potential as a herbal treatment to improve the healing of diabetic wounds.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common psychiatric conditions worldwide, with an annual escalation in prevalence. The serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) metabolism through the gut-brain axis has been revealed to be related to the development of depression. Our previous study demonstrated that Lactococcus lactis WHH2078 alleviated depression in mice by shaping the gut microbiome composition and 5-HT metabolism. However, little research has explored the synergistic effects of probiotics and natural mental health-improving products. In this study, three natural products (saffron, l-theanine, and phosphatidylserine), either individually or in combination, were orally administrated for 4 weeks in chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced mice, and their depressive behaviors, hippocampal 5-HT, and serum corticosterone were assessed. Saffron demonstrated improvement of the depressive-like behaviors via multiple behavioral tests and reversed the declined concentration of 5-HT and increased concentration of corticosterone. Following an initial screening, saffron was chosen to be combined with WHH2078, referred to as WHHMOOD™. Furthermore, the effects of WHHMOOD were evaluated in mice with depressive-like behaviors. WHHMOOD reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test, increased the time spent in the central area in open field test, and reduced the serum corticosterone level. Besides, WHHMOOD improved the CRS-induced gut microbial dysbiosis by reversing gut microbial diversity and the abundances of Ligilactobacillus, Candidatus Arthromitus, and Erysipelatoclostridium. Compared to WHH2078, WHHMOOD treatment significantly increased the travel distance and hippocampal 5-HT level in mice. In conclusion, WHHMOOD exhibited prophylactic effects on depressive-like in CRS mice, which may act as a promising agent for improving the symptoms of depression.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory illness of the gastrointestinal tract (GI), characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and tissue destruction. It affects an increasing number of individuals worldwide who suffer from Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Despite substantial advances in understanding the underlying causes of IBD, the available treatments remain restricted and are sometimes accompanied by severe consequences. Consequently, there is an urgent need to study alternate therapeutic options. This review assesses the present drugs, identifies their limitations, and proposes the use of saffron, a natural plant with great therapeutic potential based on preclinical and clinical investigations. Saffron has gained attention for its potential therapeutic benefits in treating various ailments due to its established bioactive compounds possessing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This review covers how saffron impacts the levels of calprotectin, an inflammatory marker, for various inflammatory responses in multiple diseases including IBD. Data from clinical trials were assessed to determine the efficacy and safety of using saffron to counter inflammation in multiple diseases. Studies have shown that saffron may protect against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through several mechanisms by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), reducing oxidative stress through antioxidant effects, enhancing mucosal barrier function by upregulating tight junction proteins, and modulating the gut microbiota composition to promote beneficial bacteria while suppressing pathogenic ones; these combined actions contribute to its therapeutic potential in managing and alleviating the symptoms of IBD. This will enable future research endeavors and expedite the translation of saffron-based interventions into clinical practice as a valuable adjunctive therapy or a potential alternative to conventional treatments, thereby enhancing the quality of life for individuals suffering from inflammatory diseases including IBD.",

      "abstract": "Crocus sativus L., commonly known as saffron, is a precious spice coming from Asia, in particular from Iran, the country leader in its production. The spice is derived exclusively from dried stigmas and it is the most expensive one in the world. The areas of application of saffron are multiple, in fact ranging across the food, drinks, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics sectors. As is the case with other phytochemicals, not only the final product but also saffron by-products are considered a valuable source of bioactive natural compounds. In fact, its healthy effects, especially as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories (via reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines), are well-recognized in internal medicine. In particular, its healthy effects are related to counteracting degenerative maculopathy, depression and anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndrome, cancer and chronic kidney disease, by promoting glucose metabolism. In this review, we summarize the most important papers in which saffron has turned out to be a valuable ally in the prevention and treatment of these pathologies. Moreover, we would like to promote the use of saffron by-products as part of a bio-circular economy system, aimed at reducing wastes, at maximizing the use of resources and at promoting environmental and economic sustainability.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) jeopardise uterine function in women, which is a great challenge in the clinic. Previous studies have shown that endometrial perivascular cells (En-PSCs) can improve the healing of scarred uteri and that hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) promotes angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to observe whether the combination of En-PSCs with HSYA could improve the blood supply and fertility in the rat uterus after full-thickness injury. METHODS: En-PSCs were sorted by flow cytometry, and the effect of HSYA on the proliferation and angiogenesis of the En-PSCs was detected using CCK-8 and tube formation assays. Based on a previously reported rat IUA model, the rat uteri were sham-operated, spontaneously regenerated, or treated with collagen-loaded PBS, collagen-loaded HSYA, collagen-loaded En-PSCs, or collagen-loaded En-PSCs with HSYA, and then collected at both 30 and 90 days postsurgery. HE staining and Masson staining were used to evaluate uterine structure and collagen fibre deposition, and immunohistochemical staining for α-SMA and vWF was used to evaluate myometrial regeneration and neovascularization in each group. A fertility assay was performed to detect the recovery of pregnancy function in each group. RNA-seq was performed to determine the potential mechanism underlying En-PSCs/HSYA treatment. Immunofluorescence, tube formation assays, and Western blot were used to validate the molecular mechanism involved. RESULTS: The transplantation of Collagen/En-PSCs/HSYA markedly promoted uterine repair in rats with full-thickness injury by reducing fibrosis, increasing endometrial thickness, regenerating myometrium, promoting angiogenesis, and facilitated live births. RNA sequencing results suggested that En-PSCs/HSYA activated the NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway. In vitro tube formation experiments revealed that the addition of an ErbB inhibitor diminished the tube formation ability of cocultured En-PSCs and HUVECs. Western blot results further showed that elevated levels of NRG1 and ErbB4 proteins were detected in the Collagen/En-PSCs/HSYA group compared to the Collagen/En-PSCs group. These collective results suggested that the beneficial effects of the transplantation of Collagen/En-PSCs/HSYA might be attributed to the modulation of the NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of En-PSCs/HSYA facilitated morphological and functional repair in rats with full-thickness uterine injury and may promote endometrial angiogenesis by regulating the NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Saffron, renowned for its aroma and flavor, is susceptible to adulteration due to its high value and demand. Current detection methods, including ISO standards, often fail to identify specific adulterants such as safflower or turmeric up to 20% (w/w). Therefore, the quest continues for robust screening methods using advanced techniques to tackle this persistent challenge of safeguarding saffron quality and authenticity. Advanced techniques such as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), with its molecular specificity and high sensitivity, offer promising solutions. Samples of pure saffron and saffron adulterated with safflower and turmeric at three inclusion levels (5%, 10%, and 20%) were analyzed without prior treatment. Spectral analysis revealed distinct signatures for pure saffron, safflower, and turmeric. Through principal component analysis (PCA), TOF-SIMS effectively discriminated between pure saffron and saffron adulterated with turmeric and safflower at different inclusion levels. The variation between the groups is attributed to the characteristic peaks of safflower and the amino group peaks and mineral peaks of saffron. Additionally, a study was conducted to demonstrate that semi-quantification of the level of safflower inclusion can be achieved from the normalized values of its characteristic peaks in the saffron matrix."

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of saffron versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating depression and anxiety. DATA SOURCE: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane database, were searched from inception to April 31, 2023. DATA EXTRACTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing saffron intervention with SSRIs in adults with depression or anxiety were included. DATA ANALYSIS: Random-effects meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and risk ratio (RRs) with their 95% CIs calculated continuous and binary outcomes, respectively. Meta-analysis of 8 studies assessing depression outcomes revealed a nonsignificant difference between saffron and SSRIs in reducing depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.10l 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.29). Four studies reporting anxiety outcomes showed a nonsignificant difference between saffron and SSRIs in reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD = 0.04; 95% CI: -0.22 to 0.29). With regard to safety, participants receiving saffron had fewer adverse events than the SSRI group (risk difference: -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.04; I2: 0%). CONCLUSION: Saffron could be a potential SSRI alternative to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms with fewer adverse events. Further research with larger sample sizes and in diverse populations is warranted to validate these findings and explore potential moderators of treatment response.

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise (AT) and saffron supplementation on hemostasis, inflammatory markers, and insulin resistance in obese women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A total of 44 women with T2D (mean age: 54.12 ± 5.63 years, mean BMI: 31.15 ± 1.50 kg/m2, HbA1c: 85 ± 4.2 mmol/mol) were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 11 per group): saffron + training (ST), placebo + training (PT), saffron supplement (SS), and placebo (P). The ST and PT groups completed 12 weeks of AT (three sessions per week of mild to moderate intensity). The ST and SS groups were administered a daily dose of 200 mg of saffron powder for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected 48 h before the first AT session and/or nutritional supplementation and 48 h after the last AT session and/or nutritional supplementation. Post-evaluation, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance value (HOMA-IR, p < 0.001) and serum levels of glucose (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (FIB, p < 0.001), homocysteine (HCY, p < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6, p < 0.001), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα, p < 0.001) showed significant reduction in the ST, PT, and SS groups compared to the P group (p < 0.05). In particular, the ST group showed a more significant reduction in all variables compared to the PT and SS groups (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that a 12-week intervention with AT and saffron supplementation can independently improve markers related to hemostasis, inflammation, and insulin resistance. However, their combination showed the greatest effectiveness on the above markers.",

      "abstract": "Saffron, derived from Crocus sativus, is gaining research attention for potential therapeutic applications. Its diverse clinical applications extend to cardiovascular health, diabetes management, sleep quality, psychiatric illnesses, and rheumatoid arthritis. Saffron's positive effects on blood pressure, glucose levels, cognitive function, and inflammatory markers contribute to its versatility. Additionally, carotenoids like crocin and crocetin suggest anti-cancer potential. In terms of reproductive health, saffron's impact on male reproductive health shows conflicting findings on semen parameters. However, in female reproductive health, saffron appears promising for managing dysmenorrhoea, reducing menstrual pain, regulating hormonal fluctuations, and improving overall menstrual health. Safety considerations highlight the importance of adhering to specified dosages, as excessive intake may lead to toxicity. Yet, within the therapeutic range, saffron is considered safe, relieving symptoms without serious side effects, according to clinical research. Future trials in 2023 will explore saffron's potential in cancer therapy, diabetes management, mental health, stress response, cardiovascular health, postmenopausal women's well-being, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This ongoing research underscores saffron's adaptability and promise as a natural treatment across various medical applications, emphasizing its efficacy. The current review, therefore, aims to provide up-to-date insights on saffron's role particularly in the realm of reproductive health, contributing to a growing body of evidence supporting its diverse therapeutic benefits."

Hence, the rats were injected for 15 d consecutively with saline, six different injections of Dox until the cumulative dose reached 12 mg/kg., daily Cr (40 mg/kg), and Dox + Cr combination. Cr increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), GSH content and suppressed inflammation and oxidative stress in Dox-exposed rats. Our results were confirmed by immunohistochemical findings that Cr treatment ameliorates the expressions of IL1β and TGF-β in Dox-induced nephrotoxicity. Conclusionally, Cr exhibits adequate nephroprotective effects against Dox-induced nephrotoxicity on rat kidney architecture and tissue function by stabilising cellular redox homeostasis, reducing renal fibrosis and suppressing inflammation."

As of now, no preventive or therapeutic strategies are known to counteract nicotine‑induced neurodegeneration. In this study, we explore the neuroprotective effects of crocin, a bioactive agent commonly found in saffron - a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus - using a rat model. The dose‑dependent effects of crocin were evaluated in nicotine‑induced neurodegeneration and compared with a control group. Neurobehavioral changes, assessed through the elevated plus maze, the open field test, the forced swim test, and the Morris water maze, as well as oxidative stress in the hippocampus, were evaluated. Interestingly, nicotine administration resulted in depression, anxiety, and abnormal motor and cognitive functions, while crocin treatment protected the rat brain from these abnormalities. The beneficial effects of crocin were associated with reduced oxidative stress biomarkers such as malondialdehyde, along with increases in superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities. These results demonstrate that crocin can mitigate nicotine‑induced neurodegeneration by reducing oxidative stress, potentially offering a protective measure against neurodegenerative effects in smokers.",

Compared with placebo, saffron supplementation significantly reduced FPG (WMD = -8.42 mg/dL; 95% CI: -13.37, -3.47; p = 0.001) and HbA1c (WMD = -0.22%; 95% CI: -0.33, -0.10; p < 0.001). However, there was no significant effect on insulin levels, QUICKI and HOMA-IR. CONCLUSION: Saffron is effective for patients with diabetes in terms of FPG and HbA1c, therefore, it appears to be a promising adjuvant for the glycemic control of DM. However, the overall methodological quality of the identified studies is heterogeneous, limiting the interpretation of the benefit of saffron in diabetes. More long-term follow-up, well-designed and large-scale clinical trials are warranted to draw definitive conclusions. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: The protocol of review was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (ID: CRD42023426353)."

      "abstract": "Safe and anti-inflammatory plant-based natural products present an increasing focus in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis or inflammatory bowel diseases. Among them, saffron, a spice derived from the stigma of Crocus sativus, could have anti-inflammatory properties and would be therefore a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of such conditions. However, the anti-inflammatory molecular mechanisms of saffron in humans are still understudied and unclear. In this study, combining human serum metabolites and cell cultures, we evaluated the effect of circulating metabolites from the consumption of a patented saffron extract (Safr'InsideTM) on the chondrocytes and colon epithelial cell responses to inflammatory stress. Parametric or non-parametric Analysis of Variance with post hoc tests was performed. We demonstrated that human serum containing metabolites from saffron intake attenuated IL-1β-stimulated production of PGE2 and MMP-13 in chondrocyte cells and limited the increase in ICAM-1, MCP-1, iNOS, and MMP-3 in human epithelial cells following combined IL-1β and TNF-α inflammatory stimulation. Altogether, these data provide new findings into the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of saffron on chondrocytes and enterocyte cells at the cellular level and in the context of chronic inflammatory disorders."

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Open-label, extension trial of 93 adults (>50 years) with mild/moderate AMD and vision >20/70 Snellen equivalent in at least 1 eye. Exclusion criteria included confounding visual lesions or significant gastrointestinal disease impairing absorption.Participants were given oral saffron supplementation (20 mg/day) for 12 months. Those already consuming Age-Related Eye Diseases Study (AREDS) supplements or equivalent maintained these.Primary outcomes included changes in multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) response density and latency, and changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Secondary outcomes included safety outcomes, changes in mfERG and BCVA among participants on AREDS supplements and changes in microperimetry. RESULTS: At 12 months, mean mfERG response density was significantly higher in rings 1, 2 and overall (p<0.001 for all) but not in rings 3-6, and there was no difference in response between those taking AREDS supplements and those not (p>0.05). Mean mfERG latency was not significantly different in any of rings 1-6 or overall (p>0.05 for all), again with no difference between those taking AREDS supplements or not (p>0.05). Mean BCVA was 1.6 letters worse (p<0.05) with no difference between those on AREDS supplements or not, and this may have been related to cataract progression. No saffron-related serious adverse events were detected. CONCLUSION: Saffron supplementation modestly improved mfERG responses in participants with AMD, including those using AREDS supplements. Given the chronic nature of AMD, longer-term supplementation may produce greater benefits.",

      "abstract": "Crocin-I, a valuable natural compound found in saffron (Crocus sativus L.), is the most abundant among the various crocin structures. Developing a cost-effective and scalable purification process to produce high-purity crocin-I is of great interest for future investigations into its biological properties and its potential applications in the treatment of neurological disorders. However purifying crocin-I through single-column preparative chromatography (batch) poses a yield-purity trade-off due to structural similarities among crocins, meaning that the choice of the collection window sacrifices either yield in benefit of higher purity or vice versa. This study demonstrates how the continuous countercurrent operating mode resolves this dilemma. Herein, a twin-column MCSGP (multicolumn countercurrent solvent gradient purification) process was employed to purify crocin-I. This study involved an environmentally friendly ethanolic extraction of saffron stigma, followed by an investigation into the stability of the crocin-I within the feed under varying storage conditions to ensure a stable feed composition during the purification. Then, the batch purification process was initially designed, optimized, and subsequently followed by the scale-up to the MCSGP process. To ensure a fair comparison, both processes were evaluated under similar conditions (e.g., similar total column volume). The results showed that, at a purity grade of 99.7%, the MCSGP technique demonstrated significant results, namely + 334% increase in recovery + 307% increase in productivity, and - 92% reduction in solvent consumption. To make the purification process even greener, the only organic solvent employed was ethanol, without the addition of any additive. In conclusion, this study presents the MCSGP as a reliable, simple, and economical technique for purifying crocin-I from saffron extract, demonstrating for the first time that it can be effectively applied as a powerful approach for process intensification in the purification of natural products from complex matrices.",

Saffron contains various bioactive constituents, such as crocin, crocetin, safranal, picrocrocin, and kaempferol, that have shown potential benefits for human health. Among them, crocin is the most abundant and characteristic constituent of saffron, responsible for its bright red color and antioxidant properties. One of the most promising applications of saffron and its constituents is in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders, such as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other brain disorders. Saffron and its constituents have been reported to exert neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms, such as modulating neurotransmitters, enhancing neurogenesis, reducing neuroinflammation, regulating oxidative stress, activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and modulating epigenetic factors. Several clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of saffron and its constituents in improving cognitive function, mood, and other neurological outcomes. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the therapeutic potential of saffron and its constituents in neurological disorders, from bench to bedside.

This systematic review aimed to assess the overall effects of saffron on cognition, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by searching PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Clinical Trials databases up to June 2023 according to search terms and inclusion criteria. The participants were either healthy or suffering from some diseases, including neurological and psychiatric disorders, and consumed saffron or its extracts as an intervention. The risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane guidelines, and the PRISMA statement was followed. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan and STATA software. A random-effects or fixed-effects model was used to calculate the pooled effect sizes. Forty-six RCTs were enrolled, and the duration of these trials ranged from 4 to 48 weeks with saffron or its extracts, both alone or in combination with conventional drugs. Saffron was more effective than placebo in improving cognition, depression with an overall effect size of -4.26 (95% CI: -5.76, -2.77), anxiety of -3.75 (95% CI: -5.83, -1.67), and sleep disorders of -1.91 (95% CI: -2.88, -0.93). Saffron was non-inferior to conventional drugs for treating cognitive disorders, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD, and it exhibited good tolerance with few side effects. Saffron may exert protective roles for neurological and psychiatric disorders and represents a relatively favorable and safe treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sexual satisfaction is a crucial part of a fulfilled life, and the ability to have satisfying sexual function is crucial to one's sexual health. This study investigated the effect of the combined administration of saffron and vitamin E and vitamin E alone on the sexual function of women in their reproductive years. METHODS: A triple-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 50 participants experiencing sexual dysfunction without comorbid sleep disorders or severe depression. They were allocated into two groups using a block randomization method (stratified based on the severity of moderate or mild/normal depression). During the 8-week intervention period, participants in the experimental group were administered a 15 mg saffron capsule (safrotin) in the morning and a combination capsule containing 15 mg saffron and 50 mg vitamin E (safradide) in the evening. During the same period, the control group consumed one saffron placebo capsule in the morning and one capsule containing 50 mg of vitamin E and saffron placebo in the evening (in identical appearance to safradide). The Female Sexual Function Index was used to assess sexual function, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to measure levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. These measures were administered at baseline as well as four and eight weeks post-intervention, with an additional measurement taken four weeks after the intervention ceased. The repeated measures ANOVA, ANCOVA, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the groups. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the experimental group (saffron and vitamin E) demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the overall mean score of sexual function compared to the control group (placebo of saffron and vitamin E) (adjusted mean difference (AMD): 4.6; 95%CI: 3.1 to 6.1; p < 0.001). The mean scores for sexual function dimensions, namely libido, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, except for pain, were consistently higher than those of the control group across all time points (p < 0.001). Additionally, the mean score for lubrication was significantly higher only at the eighth-week measurement (p = 0.004). The mean depression score in the experimental group was significantly lower than in the control group at all-time points, i.e., four (p = 0.011) and eight weeks after the intervention (p = 0.005), and four weeks after the end of the intervention (p = 0.007). The experimental group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in mean anxiety score compared to the control group at four weeks into the intervention (p = 0.016) and four weeks following the end of the intervention (p = 0.002). At eight weeks post-intervention, however, there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.177). Additionally, the experimental group exhibited a significant reduction in the overall mean stress score compared to the control group after the intervention (AMD: -2.3; 95%CI: -3.1 to -1.5; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Using the combination of saffron and vitamin E is more effective in improving sexual function and its domains compared to vitamin E alone in women of reproductive age with sexual dysfunction without severe depression. Also, it diminishes the degree of depression, anxiety, and stress more compared to vitamin E alone. However, further research is required to arrive at a more definitive conclusion.

      "abstract": "The saffron industry produces large by-products, including petals with potential bioactive compounds, which are cheap and abundant, making them an attractive alternative to expensive stigmas for extracting bioactive components. This study aimed to optimize the extraction conditions of bioactive compounds from vacuum-dried saffron petals using an ultrasound-assisted acidified ethanol solvent. Three factors were considered: ethanol concentration (0-96%), citric acid concentration in the final solvent (0-1%), and ultrasound power (0-400 watt). This study examined the effects of these factors on parameters like maximum antioxidant activity, total anthocyanin content, total phenolic content, and the total flavonoid content of the extraction. This study found that saffron petal extract's antioxidant activity increases with higher ethanol concentration, citric acid dose, and ultrasound power, but that an increased water content leads to non-antioxidant compounds. Increasing the dosage of citric acid improved the extraction of cyanidin-3-glucoside at different ultrasound power levels. The highest extraction was achieved with 400 watts of ultrasound power and 1% citric acid. Ethanol concentration did not affect anthocyanin extraction. Higher ethanol concentration and greater citric acid concentration doses resulted in the maximum extraction of total phenolic content, with a noticeable drop in extraction at higher purity levels. This study found that increasing the proportion of citric acid in the final solvent did not affect flavonoid extraction at high ethanol concentration levels, and the highest efficiency was observed at 200 watts of ultrasound power. The optimum values of the independent parameters for extracting bioactive compounds from saffron petals included 96% ethanol concentration, 0.67% citric acid concentration, and 216 watts of ultrasound power, resulting in a desirability value of 0.82. This ultrasound-assisted acidified ethanolic extract can be used in the food industry as a natural antioxidant and pigment source."

Despite the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy, medication resistance and adverse effects limit its effectiveness, leading researchers to explore alternative treatments, including herbal remedies. Saffron, a well-known spice derived from the Crocus sativus L. plant, has shown potential as a BC treatment. The active components of saffron exhibit anti-cancer properties by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell division, and modulating signaling pathways implicated in cancer development, such as PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, and MAPK. Clinical findings suggest that saffron can alleviate chemotherapy-induced symptoms, reduce serum tumor marker levels, and enhance quality of life. Preliminary clinical trials are investigating the safety and efficacy of saffron in treating BC, with recent evidence indicating that recommended doses of saffron supplementation are well-tolerated and safe. This review provides an overview of the anti-tumor effects of saffron and its unique chemical composition in BC. However, further research and clinical studies are imperative to fully comprehend the potential of saffron in adjuvant therapy for BC patients.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Crocus sativus L. known as saffron, is a popular food condiment with a high aroma, deep colour, and long and thick threads (stigmas) cultivated in Iran, Morocco, Spain, Italy, China, Japan, France, Turkey, and India. In 'Ayurveda', saffron is acknowledged for its immunostimulant, aphrodisiac, cardiotonic, liver tonic, nervine tonic, carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic, emmenagogue, galactagogue, febrifuge, sedative, relaxant, and anxiolytic activities. The renowned Persian physician and philosopher, Avicenna, delineated saffron as an antidepressant, hypnotic, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, bronchodilator, and aphrodisiac in his book, the Canon of Medicine. Within traditional Iranian Medicine (TIM), saffron is characterized as a mood elevator and a rejuvenator for the body and senses. Further, the ethnopharmacological evidence indicates that saffron has shown an effect against neurodegenerative disorders namely, dementia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's with its bioactive constituents i.e., carotenoids and apocarotenoids. AIM: The present study aimed to investigate the potential of standardized (Kashmir Saffron, India) Crocus sativus extract (CSE) in chronic scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) accumulation in rat brains by targeting AChE inhibition and scopolamine mechanistic effect. METHODS: The experimental animals were divided into six groups: group 1: normal control, group 2: scopolamine, group 3,4 and 5 rivastigmine tartrate, CSE (p.o. 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg) respectively. Each treatment group received scopolamine after 20 min of dosing, till 4 weeks. The effects of different treatments on learning, acquisition, and reversal memory were performed using a Morris water maze test. In addition to behavioral assessments, biochemical parameters such as AChE, IL-6, and antioxidants were measured in isolated brains. Histological observations were also conducted to assess the presence of Aβ plaques and NFT. Furthermore, molecular docking was performed to explore the potential AChE inhibitory activity of the bioactive constituents of standardized CSE. RESULTS: Scopolamine produces memory impairment, and its chronic administration forms Aβ plaque and NFT in rat brains. Supplementation with CSE in presence of scopolamine has shown remarkable effects on behavioural activity, special acquisition, and reversal memory. The CSE has also shown promising effects on AChE inhibition and antioxidant activity. The results of the docking study also indicate that trans-crocetin, i.e., a biologically active metabolite of Crocins, has strong AChE inhibitory activity, supported by an in vivo animal experiment. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with CSE significantly attenuates the formation of Aβ plaque and NFT in the hippocampus at a dose of 20 mg/kg per day. In addition, CSE also counters scopolamine-induced neuroinflammation.",

Quantitative analysis of plant hormones provides a basis for more efficient research on their synthesis, transportation, metabolism, and action. However, starch (which interferes with extraction) is present in high levels, and hormone levels are extremely low, in saffron corms, thereby hampering accurate determination of plant-hormone levels in saffron. Herein, we screened an efficient and convenient pre-treatment method for plant materials containing abundant amounts of starch. Also, we proposed an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin (IAA). Then, the method was applied for the detection of hormone-content differences between flowering and non-flowering top buds, as well as between lateral and top buds. Our method showed high sensitivity, reproducibility, and reliability. Specifically, good linearity in the range 2-100 ng ml-1 was achieved in the determination of ABA and IAA, and the correlation coefficient (R2) was >0.9982. The relative standard deviation was 2.956-14.51% (intraday) and 9.57-18.99% (interday), and the recovery range was 89.04-101.1% (n = 9). The matrix effect was 80.38-90.50% (n = 3). The method was thoroughly assessed employing various \"green\" chemistry evaluation tools: Blue Applicability Grade Index (BAGI), Complementary Green Analytical Procedure Index (Complex GAPI) and Red Green Blue 12 Algorithm (RGB12). These tools revealed the good greenness, analytical performance, applicability, and overall sustainability alignment of our method. Quantitative results showed that, compared with saffron with a flowering phenotype cultivated at 25 °C, the contents of IAA and ABA in the terminal buds of saffron cultivated at 16 °C decreased significantly. When cultivated at 25 °C, the IAA and ABA contents in the terminal buds of saffron were 1.54- and 4.84-times higher than those in the lateral buds, respectively. A simple, rapid, and accurate UPLC-MS/MS method was established to determine IAA and ABA contents. Using this method, a connection between the contents of IAA and ABA and the flowering phenotype was observed in the quantification results. Our data lay a foundation for studying the flowering mechanism of saffron.",

      "abstract": "Due to an increase in the number of older people in recent years, neurodegenerative diseases as the most important age-related neurological disorders are considered as a great threat to human health. The treatment strategies for these disorders are symptomatic and there is no known definitive treatment; however, recently, several studies have investigated the effectiveness of some herbs and their components in limiting the progression and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we searched Medline (via PubMed), Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords used in the search were: saffron [title/abstract] or (saffron compound [title/abstract]) and (neurological disorders [title/abstract]), publication date range (2010-2023), and language (English). After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 articles remained. Of the 30 articles included in the study, six studies on the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders by saffron and its components were in the clinical trial phase, and 24 studies were in the preclinical phase. Saffron and its compounds can play an important role in inhibiting neuroinflammation and excitotoxic pathways, modulating autophagy and apoptosis, attenuating oxidative damage, and activating defensive antioxidant enzymes, resulting in neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to review the studies on the effects of saffron and its compounds on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "Smoking is one of the main causes of death in the world. Cigarette use is related with various components of metabolic syndrome (e.g., insulin resistance, raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation state) and psychiatric disorders. This study was conducted to determine the effect of crocin (Cro) supplementation on nicotine dependence, anxiety, depression, and metabolic indices in smokers. A total of 50 smokers were selected and randomly categorized into two groups (crocin and placebo). The intervention group received crocin (30 mg per day; n = 25) and placebo (containing Avicel; n = 25) once a day. The primary (nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety inventory) and secondary (metabolic indices) outcomes were assessed at the start of the intervention and after the 3 months. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the treatment effects on the outcomes adjusting for confounding variables. The primary outcome results such as nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety inventory did not have a significant difference among the intervention groups (P > 0.05). Also in the secondary outcomes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels did indicate a significant difference by Cro intervention (β - 3.27 mg/dL; 95% CI, - 5.23, - 1.31; P = 0.002; β - 0.76 μIU/mL; 95% CI, - 1.38, - 0.15; P = 0.01; β - 0.18; 95% CI, - 0.29, - 0.07; P = 0.002), respectively. There were also significant reductions in serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (β - 0.72 mg/L; 95% CI, - 1.37, - 0.07; P = 0.03), compared with the placebo. Cro intake may have favorable effects on the level of FPG, insulin, HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP in smokers. However, due to the small sample size and limited scientific reports on smokers, further studies are necessary. ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: IRCT20170420033551N11.",

      "abstract": "Previous research has shown that natural medications pose health risks, especially in subjects with comorbidities. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of saffron ethanolic extract (SEE) administration in early and established atherosclerotic rabbits. Rabbits were given a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) for 4 and 8 weeks to induce early and established atherosclerosis respectively, and then they were treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg/day SEE. The body weight of the animals was recorded. Blood samples were collected at baseline, pre-treatment, and post-treatment for hematological studies, lipid profiles, and biochemical profiles. Tissue specimens of the vital organs were subjected to histological examination. The above parameters were significantly altered post-intervention with 4 and 8 weeks of HCD. No significant differences in body weight were observed in all the groups post-treatment with 50 and 100mg/kg of SEE compared to pre-treatment. However, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, serum urea, and glucose significantly decreased post-treatment with 50 and 100mg/kg/day SEE compared to pre-treatment in early and established atherosclerosis groups. Hematological parameters that were affected post-intervention with HCD returned to their baseline values post-treatment with 50 and 100mg/kg/day SEE. There was a significant improvement in the vital organs post-treatment with 50 and 100mg/kg SEE. SEE can safely be administered without causing harmful effects on the hematological, biochemical profiles, and vital organs. Notably, SEE exerts hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effects on atherosclerotic conditions. Further clinical trials are warranted to ensure the safety of saffron administration in patients with atherosclerosis-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the USA. Several studies have demonstrated the antitumor properties of saffron in different types of cancers, including prostate cancer. The oral administration of saffron extract has been reported to have antitumor effects on aggressive prostate-cancer-cell-line-derived xenografts in nude male mice. The objective of this study was to carry out in vitro studies of saffron-treated prostate cancer cells to ascertain the effects of saffron on key intermediates in prostate carcinogenesis. Our studies demonstrated the significant inhibition of cell proliferation for androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines via apoptotic pathways. We also demonstrate the statistically significant down-regulation of DNA methyltransferases (COMT, MGMT, EHMT2, and SIRT1 deacetylase) in saffron-treated prostate cancer cells. In addition, saffron-treated prostate cancer cells displayed a statistically significant dysregulation of DNA repair intermediates (WRN, p53, RECQ5, MST1R, and WDR70) in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that saffron treatment induced changes in the expression of other key genes (DNMT1, DNMT3b, MBD2, CD44, HDAC3, c-Myc, NF-kB, TNFα, AR, N-RAS, and PTEN) in prostate cancer cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the important mechanisms by which saffron mediates anti-tumor properties in prostate cancer. These findings suggest that the use of saffron supplements alongside standard treatment protocols may yield beneficial effects for individuals with prostate cancer.",

Although multiple studies have highlighted the stress- alleviating properties of saffron extract, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study employs the unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS) animal model to investigate the impact of a standardized saffron extract, Affron® (AFN), on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation and neuroplasticity in Wistar rats following repeated oral administration. The research evaluates AFN's effects on various stress-related parameters, including hypothalamic gene expression, stress hormone levels, and the sucrose preference test. In animals subjected to continuous unpredictable CMS, repetitive administration of AFN at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg effectively normalized HPA axis dysregulation and enhanced neuroplasticity. Increased concentrations of AFN demonstrated greater efficacy. Following AFN oral administration, adrenocorticotropic and corticosterone hormone levels exhibited significant or nearly significant reductions in comparison to subjects exposed to stress only. These changes align with the alleviation of stress and the normalization of the HPA axis. These findings elucidate AFN's role in stress mitigation, affirm its health benefits, validate its potential as a treatment for stress-related symptoms, confirm its physiological effectiveness, and emphasize its therapeutic promise.",

In search of new anti-obesity agents, Crocus sativus, popularly known as saffron, is a nutraceutical agent, praised for its beneficial effects. The study aimed to investigate the possible effect of Kozanis saffron administration on weight management of obese prediabetic adolescents. Seventy-four obese prediabetic adolescents participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of three arms, randomly assigned to receive either Kozanis saffron (n = 25, 60 mg/day), metformin (n = 25, 1000 mg/day) or a placebo (n = 24), for twelve weeks. Anthropometry, glycemic markers and lipid profiles were investigated at baseline and post-intervention. Saffron supplementation significantly reduced the weight z-score, BMI, BMI z-score and waist circumference (WC) of obese adolescents; however, this reduction was less significant compared to the effect of metformin. Metformin administration offered a significantly more profound improvement in anthropometry compared to saffron administration. Saffron administration also provided significant improvements in weight, weight z-scores, BMI values, BMI z-scores and WCs compared to the placebo. Saffron supplementation failed to change any glycemic marker, but provided a significant reduction in fasting triglyceride levels and also a significant increase in fasting HDL levels. Saffron Kozanis constitutes a promising nutraceutical option for adolescents and children with obesity and prediabetes in need of weight management."

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis refers to a complex inflammatory response caused by multiple factors, which is a known cause of liver cirrhosis and even liver cancer. As a valuable medicine food homology herb, saffron has been widely used in the world. Saffron is commonly used in liver-related diseases and has rich therapeutic and health benefits. The therapeutic effect is satisfactory, but its mechanism is still unclear. In order to clarify these problems, we planned to determine the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of saffron extract in preventing and treating liver fibrosis through network pharmacology analysis combined with in vivo validation experiments. Through UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS analysis, a total of fifty-six nutrients and active ingredients were identified, and nine of them were screened to predict their therapeutic targets for liver fibrosis. Then, network pharmacology analysis was applied to identify 321 targets for saffron extract to alleviate liver fibrosis. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis showed that the putative targets of saffron for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis are mainly involved in the calcium signaling pathway, the HIF-1 signaling pathway, endocrine resistance, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, lipid and atherosclerosis, and the cAMP signaling pathway. Based on the CCl4-induced liver fibrosis mice model, we experimentally confirmed that saffron extract can alleviate the severity and pathological changes during the progression of liver fibrosis. RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis confirmed that saffron treatment can prevent the CCl4-induced upregulation of HIF-1α, VEGFA, AKT, and PI3K, suggesting that saffron may regulate AKT/HIF-1α/VEGF and alleviate liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although activation of inflammatory processes is essential to fight infections, its prolonged impact on brain function is well known to contribute to the pathophysiology of many medical conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, identifying novel strategies to selectively counter the harmful effects of neuroinflammation appears as a major health concern. In that context, this study aimed to test the relevance of a nutritional intervention with saffron, a spice known for centuries for its beneficial effect on health. METHODS: For this purpose, the impact of an acute oral administration of a standardized saffron extract, which was previously shown to display neuromodulatory properties and reduce depressive-like behavior, was measured in mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 830 μg/kg, ip). RESULTS: Pretreatment with saffron extract (6.5 mg/kg, per os) did not reduce LPS-induced sickness behavior, preserving therefore this adaptive behavioral response essential for host defense. However, it interfered with delayed changes of expression of cytokines, chemokines and markers of microglial activation measured 24 h post-LPS treatment in key brain areas for behavior and mood control (frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum). Importantly, this pretreatment also counteracted by that time the impact of LPS on several neurobiological processes contributing to inflammation-induced emotional alterations, in particular the activation of the kynurenine pathway, assessed through the expression of its main enzymes, as well as concomitant impairment of serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. CONCLUSION: Altogether, this study provides important clues on how saffron extract interferes with brain function in conditions of immune stimulation and supports the relevance of saffron-based nutritional interventions to improve the management of inflammation-related comorbidities."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Crocus sativus also known as saffron, is one of the most popular traditional plants. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saffron extracts in ADHD. METHOD: This study includes clinical trial studies that assessed the efficacy and/or safety of saffron in ADHD patients. Non-English papers, review articles, commentaries, letters, observational studies, thesis, animal studies, in-vitro studies, and conference abstracts were not included. The risk of bias in randomized studies was evaluated based on the Cochrane RoB.2, and risk of bias in pre-post intervention studies was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS: Four studies met our inclusion criteria with a total of 118 patients. The results manifested an efficient role of saffron as either an adjuvant therapy to MPH or a single therapy against ADHD, without significant safety issues. DISCUSSION: Saffron demonstrates promise in improving ADHD symptoms, with an acceptable safety profile. Future well-designed multicentral studies are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, is characterized by inflammation that affects not only the liver but also other organs and the musculoskeletal system. The standard therapy for RA is methotrexate (MTX), which has safety limitations. The extract from Crocus sativus L. (saffron-SF) is also known for its anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we decided to investigate the potential benefit of SF in monotherapy via two doses (SF1-25 mg/kg of b.w.; SF2-50 mg/kg of b.w.) and in combination with MTX (0.3 mg/kg of b.w., twice a week) using adjuvant arthritis in rats. To evaluate these therapeutic settings, we used biometric, immunological, and biochemical parameters, as well as the relative gene expression of the mRNA in the liver. Our results showed a statistically significant increase in the experimental animals' body weight and the arthritic score (AS) on day 14 for monotherapy with SF1 and SF2. The change of hind paw volume (CHPV) was significant only for SF2 monotherapy on the 14th day of the experiment. A combination of SF1 and SF2 with MTX significantly modulated all the biometric parameters during the experimental period. Additionally, AS and CHPV improved considerably compared to MTX monotherapy on day 21. Furthermore, all monotherapies and combination therapies were significant for the biochemical parameter γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in the joint. GGT activity in the spleen was less pronounced; only MTX in combination with SF1 significantly modified this parameter. The higher dose of SF monotherapy (SF2) was similarly significant with respect to immunological parameters, such as plasmatic IL-17A, IL-1β, and MMP-9 on day 21. The combination of both doses of SF with MTX significantly improved these immunological parameters, except for C-reactive protein (CRP), which was influenced only by the higher dose of SF2 in combination with MTX in plasma at the end of the experiment. A different effect was found for the relative expression of CD36 mRNA, where only SF1 significantly decreased gene expression in the liver. However, the relative gene mRNA expression of IL-1β in the liver was significantly reduced by the SF monotherapies and the combination of both SF doses with MTX. Our findings showed SF's partial antiarthritic and anti-inflammatory potential in monotherapy, but the effect was stronger in combination with MTX.",

The present study aimed to compare the effect of saffron and corrective exercises on depression and quality of life in women with MS. This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 80 MS women for 12 weeks. Participants were selected through convenience sampling and allocated into four study groups (three intervention groups and one control group) using the stratified block randomization. The Expanded Disability Status Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale were used to collect data at the start of the study and also at the end of the sixth and the twelfth weeks. At the end of the twelfth week, the depression mean scores in all experimental groups (saffron group, corrective exercises group, corrective exercises + saffron group) were significantly different compared to the control group (P < 0.05), and this difference in corrective exercises + saffron group was more than the others. Also, at the end of the twelfth week, the mean scores of the quality of life (both physical and mental dimensions) in all experimental groups were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05). The saffron group in physical dimension and the corrective exercises + saffron group in psychological dimension showed a significant difference with other groups. Although each of the corrective exercises program and saffron consumption alone were effective in reducing depression and enhancing the quality of life in MS patients, the consequences will be more beneficial in case these two interventions are used together. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage MS patients to consume saffron supplement along with doing physical activities in caring and rehabilitation programs.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Crocus sativus L. (saffron, Iridaceae) has been traditionally used for thousands of years as herbal medicine for many diseases, including type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially in Sri Lanka. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis on C. sativus for T2DM value traditional knowledge about this species. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the effectiveness of C. sativus powdered plant, hydroethanolic extract and crocin in reducing fasting blood sugar (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, and other metabolic parameters in patients with T2DM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis based on searches in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane, including all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published before January 2, 2023. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the risks of bias. The effects of C. sativus and crocin were assessed on glycemic, metabolic, and blood pressure parameters. Weighted (WMD) or standardized (SMD) mean differences (before-after) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of the outcomes were extracted or estimated and meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration). This protocol was registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42023390073). RESULTS: Fifteen of 29 studies were included. Saffron powdered plant decreased AST (WMD -1.19, 95%CI -2.24, -0.13), but increased BMI (WMD 0.56, 95%CI 0.07, 1.05); saffron extract decreased HbA1c (WMD -0.35, 95%CI -0.65, -0.06), FBG (WMD -26.90, 95%CI -38.87, -14.93), creatinine (WMD -0.12, 95%CI -0.19, -0.05), and total cholesterol (WMD -9.29, 95%CI -18.25, -0.33); and crocin decreased HbA1c (WMD -0.43, 95%CI -0.66, -0.20), FBG (WMD -14.10, 95%CI -22.91, -5.30), and systolic blood pressure (WMD -8.18, 95%CI -12.75, -3.61), but increased creatinine levels (WMD 0.24, 95%CI 0.17, 0.32). Of the 15 included studies, 14 had a moderate risk of bias, and one study had a low risk of bias. CONCLUSION: C. sativus (saffron) powdered plant, extract, and crocin have potential as an adjunct treatment for T2DM, improving control of metabolic and clinical parameters. However, C. sativus extract seems to be superior because it was effective in more parameters and did not induce adverse effects. Since many studies were at moderate risk of bias, further high-quality research is needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of this plant.",

      "abstract": "A mechanism shared by most neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), is neuroinflammation. It has been shown to have a link between cognitive impairment and retinal function under neuroinflammatory conditions, confirming the essential role of the retina as a window to the brain. Here, we characterize a mouse model of LPS-induced neuroinflammation describing the parallel deterioration of both memory and visual function. Then, we demonstrate, using the Novel Object Recognition test (NOR) and electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, that preventive, chronic treatment with saffron Repron® is able to reduce the neuroinflammation process and prevent the impairment of both cognitive and visual function. The improvement in behavioral and visual function is confirmed by the pattern of expression of neuroinflammation-related genes and related proteins where pre-treatment with Repron® saffron presents a positive modulation compared with that obtained in animals treated with LPS alone. These results hold for retinal tissue and partially in the brain, where it appears that the onset of damage was delayed. This trend underlines the critical role of the retina as a most sensitive portion of the central nervous system to LPS-induced damage and could be used as a \"sensor\" for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's."

      "abstract": "Saffron is a well-known expensive spice, which has many pharmacological properties against a variety of ailments. Saffron stigma and leaf contain apocarotenoids and bioactive phytochemicals having therapeutic potential against human disorders. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the most common toxins in today's aquatic environment. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a high molecular weight PAHs prototype, and reported as a potent neurotoxicant, which is profoundly contaminating the environment. The present study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of Saffron stigma extracts and crocin, on B[a]P-induced behavioral changes, altered antioxidant activities, and neurodegeneration in zebrafish. The behavioral responses monitored through the light-dark preference test and novel tank diving test suggested that B[a]P treated zebrafish group showed alteration in anxiolytic-like behavior. Animals exhibited their native behavior when treated alone with Saffron Stigma Extract (SSE) and crocin, an apocarotenoid which also reduced the altered behavior induced by B[a]P. The SSE and crocin stimulated the antioxidant activities with an accumulation of reduced glutathione and catalase enzymes, indicating a protective role against B[a]P-induced oxidative stress and behavioral deficits. The histopathological studies showed the percentage change of pyknotic cell counts in the Periventricular Gray Zone region of the Optic Tectum was 1.74 folds high in B[a]P treated animals as compared to control. Furthermore, the treatment of SSE and crocin reduced the pyknosis process induced by B[a]P-mediated neurodegeneration, possibly due to a better protective mechanism. Future studies may reveal the detailed mechanisms of action of potent SSE and crocin like bioactive compounds having neuroprotective potentials against neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles and is mainly synthesized in the pineal gland from tryptophan after its conversion into serotonin. Under normal conditions, less than 5% of tryptophan is reserved for the synthesis of serotonin and melatonin. The remaining 95% is metabolized in the liver through the kynurenine pathway. Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cortisol increase the metabolism of tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway and reduce its availability for the synthesis of melatonin and serotonin, which may cause alterations in mood and sleep. The standardized saffron extract (affron®) has shown beneficial effects on mood and sleep disorders in humans, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the effects of affron® supplementation on the kynurenine pathway and the synthesis of melatonin in rats. For this purpose, adult male Wistar rats were supplemented for 7 days with 150 mg/kg of affron® or vehicle (2 mL/kg water) administered by gavage one hour before sleep. Affron® supplementation reduced body weight gain and increased the circulating levels of melatonin, testosterone, and c-HDL. Moreover, animals supplemented with affron® showed decreased serum levels of kynurenine, ET-1, and c-LDL. In the pineal gland, affron® reduced Il-6 expression and increased the expression of Aanat, the key enzyme for melatonin synthesis. In the liver, affron® administration decreased the mRNA levels of the enzymes of the kynurenine pathway Ido-2, Tod-2, and Aadat, as well as the gene expression of Il-1β and Tnf-α. Finally, rats treated with affron® showed increased mRNA levels of the antioxidant enzymes Ho-1, Sod-1, Gsr, and Gpx-3, both in the liver and in the pineal gland. In conclusion, affron® supplementation reduces kynurenine levels and promotes melatonin synthesis in rats, possibly through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, making this extract a possible alternative for the treatment and/or prevention of mood and sleep disorders."

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurobehavioral disease that induces cognitive and behavioral alterations, usually accompanied by oxidative stress in the brain. Crocus sativus (saffron) and its active ingredient, crocin, have potent antioxidative effects that may benefit autistic behaviors. This study aimed to determine the effects of saffron extract and crocin against brain oxidative stress and behavioral, motor, and cognitive deficits in an animal model of autism in male offspring rats. 14 female rats were randomly divided into the saline and valproic acid (VPA) groups. Then, they were placed with mature male rats to mate and produce offspring. VPA (500 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected on day 12.5 of pregnancy (gestational day, GD 12.5) to induce an experimental model of autism. 48 male pups were left undisturbed for 29 days. First-round behavioral tests (before treatments) were performed on 30-33 post-natal days (PND), followed by 28 days of treatment (PND 34-61) with saffron (30 mg/kg, IP), crocin (15 or 30 mg/kg, i.p.), or saline (2 ml/kg, i.p.). The second round of behavioral tests (after treatments) was performed on PND 62-65 to assess the effects of the treatments on behavioral and cognitive features. In the end, animals were sacrificed under deep anesthesia, and their brains were dissected to evaluate the brain oxidative stress parameters, including malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT). VPA injection into female rats increased anxiety-like behaviors, enhanced pain threshold, impaired motor functions, disturbed balance power, increased MDA, and decreased GSH and CAT in their male offspring. 28 days of treatment with saffron or crocin significantly ameliorated behavioral abnormalities, reduced MDA, and increased GSH and CAT levels. Brain oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autistic-like behaviors. Saffron and crocin ameliorate anxiety-like behaviors, pain responses, motor functions, and brain oxidative stress parameters in an experimental model of autism. Saffron and crocin may hold promise as herbal-based pharmacological treatments for individuals with autism. However, further histological evidence is needed to confirm their efficacy.",

It has been suggested that saffron and crocin extracted from it also up-regulate the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), down-regulate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and untimely improve the body organs dysfunction. Inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) also is attributed to crocin.

Saffron showed antinociceptive activities in formalin-, carrageenan-, and capsaicin-induced experimental pain models. Saffron analgesic activities affected several targets, including ion channels of nociceptors; the adrenergic system and central histaminic system; inhibition of inflammatory pathways, apoptotic pathways, and oxidative stress; regulation of NO pathway, and the endocannabinoid system. Clinical studies showed analgesia of Saffron in rheumatoid arthritis, after-pain following childbirth, dysmenorrhea, and fibromyalgia.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a debilitating condition that affects the mind and the individual's body. The improving effects of saffron on depression and anxiety have long been discussed, with limited information about the molecular mechanism of action. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: Investigating the effect of saffron carotenoids, Crocin and Crocetin, on depression and anxiety in rats by emphasizing some signaling pathways involved. STUDY DESIGN: Depression and anxiety were induced in rats via unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Then different rat groups were treated with Crocin, Crocetin, Fluoxetine, and vehicle. Behavioral tests were done before and after treatment. METHODS: The serum Serotonin and Corticosterone and the expression of some hippocampal signaling proteins were studied. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools were used to predict the interactions of Crocin/ Crocetin with the Serotonin transporter and NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Then, the patch-clamp was used to study the interaction of Crocetin with the NMDA receptor. RESULTS: Various behavioral tests confirmed the induction of depression and the improvement of depression by these natural carotenoids. In addition, Crocin/ Crocetin significantly increased the decreased serum Serotonin and reduced the increased serum Corticosterone in the depressed groups. They also increased or caused a trend of increase in the CREB, ERK, BAD, BDNF, p11, and 5-HT1B expression in the hippocampus of the depressed groups. In addition, there were an increase or a trend in p-CREB/CREB, p-ERK1/2 /ERK1/2, and p-BAD/BAD ratios in the Crocin/ Crocetin treated depressed groups. However, the NR2B and FOXO3a expression showed a trend of decrease in depressed groups after treatment. The bioinformatics data indicated that Crocin/ Crocetin could bind to the Serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. Both carotenoids bind to the same site as Fluoxetine in the SLC6A4. However, they bound to different sites on the NR2B. So, Crocetin binds to NR2B at the same site as Ifenprodil. But Crocin bound to another site. The whole cell patch-clamp recording on the normal rat hippocampus revealed a significant decrease in the NMDA peak amplitude after Crocetin treatment, indicating its inhibitory effect on this receptor. CONCLUSION: The antidepressant activities of Crocin/ Crocetin are possibly due to their effects on Serotonin and Corticosterone serum concentrations, NR2B expression, and the downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, these natural carotenoids, like Fluoxetine, induced an increasing tendency in p11 and 5HT1B in depressed rats.",

      "abstract": "Despite the existence of effective drugs used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), many patients fail to respond or lose response over time. Further, many drugs can carry serious adverse effects, including increased risk of infections and malignancies. Saffron (Crocus sativus) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. Its protective role in IBD and how the microbiome and metabolome play a role has not been explored extensively. We aimed to establish whether saffron treatment modulates the host microbiome and metabolic profile in experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice with 3% DSS and treated with either saffron in a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight or vehicle through daily gavage. On day 10, stool pellets from mice were collected and analyzed to assess saffron's effect on fecal microbiota and metabolites through 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted primary metabolite analysis. Saffron treatment maintained gut microbiota homeostasis by counter-selecting pro-inflammatory bacteria and maintained Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio, which was otherwise disturbed by DSS treatment. Several metabolites (uric acid, cholesterol, 2 hydroxyglutaric acid, allantoic acid, 2 hydroxyhexanoic acid) were altered significantly with saffron treatment in DSS-treated mice, and this might play a role in mediating saffron's colitis-mitigating effects. These data demonstrate saffron's therapeutic potential, and its protective role is modulated by gut microbiota, potentially acting through changes in metabolites."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep quality is defined as an individual's consent to sleep experience. Poor sleep quality has important adverse health outcomes. There are drugs to treat sleep disorders but consumption of these drugs is accompanied by adverse effects whereas herbal treatments have fewer side effects. Saffron is spice obtained from Crocus sativus flower. Several articles have been done on its effects on the quality of sleep and its safety. This review for the first time critically evaluates effect of saffron on sleep quality improvement. METHOD: The search technique aims to get all related published data-based up to 2022 articles. PubMed, Central, Google Scholar, and Scopus were examined. Only full reports were evaluated (abstracts were excluded). The first screening was done by title and abstract. Then full text of articles was read and irrelevant articles were removed. Duplicate articles were also removed by Endnote. By using Cochrane risk of bias tool assessment, a quality score based on probability of bias was given. Methodological characteristics were also evaluated using the criteria of Stevinson and Ernst. RESULT: In the systematic review, 5 randomized clinical trials with 379 participants from 3 countries were identified. In placebo-comparison trials, saffron contains a large treatment. CONCLUSION: It seems that saffron has a beneﬁcial influence on duration and quality of sleep. Saffron, crocin, and safranal induce hypnotic effects by increasing the duration of sleep. Research conducted so far provides initial support and safety for use of saffron to improve sleep quality."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress and saffron seem to affect glucoregulation mechanisms and insulin resistance in different ways. Impacts of the aqueous saffron extract were investigated on serum glucose levels, serum insulin levels, the homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B), the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), adrenal weight, and hepatic gene expression of angiotensinogen (Agt) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in rats under sub-chronic stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two male rats were divided into six groups: control, restraint stress (6h/day for seven days), saffron (30 and 60 mg/kg) treatments for seven days, and post-stress saffron (30 and 60 mg/kg) treatments for seven days. The serum glucose and insulin levels, hepatic gene expressions of Agt and TNF-α, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, and adrenal gland weight were measured. RESULTS: One-week recovery following sub-chronic stress led to non-significant hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. The hepatic Agt and TNF-α mRNA levels increased significantly in this group. Saffron administration led to enhanced hepatic Agt mRNA in the non-stressed subjects. In addition, serum glucose levels, insulin resistance, and hepatic Agt gene expression significantly increased in stress-saffron groups. The hepatic TNF-α gene expression was reduced only in the stress-saffron 60 group. CONCLUSION: Saffron treatment after sub-chronic stress not only did not improve glucose tolerance but also enhanced insulin resistance. It indicated the interaction of saffron and sub-chronic stress to promote renin-angiotensin system activity. In addition, the saffron treatment decreased TNF-α gene expression after sub-chronic stress. The synergistic stimulating effect of saffron and sub-chronic stress on gene expression of hepatic Agt led to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia."

To investigate heterogeneity, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were utilized. Begg and Egger's tests were used to measure publication bias. Our results showed that saffron, crocin, and safranal were able to significantly reduce the serum levels of oxidants with strong efficacy so that saffron had the highest effectiveness on serum malondialdehyde (SMD, -2.84 (μmol/L) [95% confidence interval (CI), -4.32 to -1.36]; p < .001, I 2 = 83.5%). In addition, saffron and its effective compounds were highly effective by increasing the serum level of antioxidants. In addition, saffron and its effective compounds were able to significantly increase the serum level of antioxidants with strong efficacy, while saffron had the highest effect on the serum level of total antioxidant capacity (SMD, 3.90 (μmol/L) [95% CI, 0.78-7.03]; p = .014, I 2 = 86.9%). The findings of this study show that treatment with saffron, crocin, and safranal by strengthening the antioxidant defense system and modulating oxidative stress shows antidiabetic effects in the diabetic model of rats, also these findings support the potential effect of saffron and its effective compounds for the management of diabetes and its complications. However, more human studies are needed."

However, its clinical efficacy is hampered by its safety profile and dose-limiting toxicity. Saffron is a natural product that has shown significant anticancer effects. The combination treatment of saffron with chemotherapeutic agents has been considered a new strategy. METHODS: Herein, saffron extract as a natural anticancer substance was combined with cisplatin to assess their combined efficacy against tumor development in vitro. In A549 and QU-DB cell lines, the combined effect of the saffron extract with cisplatin led to a significant reduction in cell viability as compared to cisplatin alone. RESULTS: After 48 h incubation a considerable reduction in ROS levels in the QU-DB cell line upon treatment with cisplatin in the presence of saffron extract in comparison with cells treated with cisplatin alone. Furthermore, apoptosis increased significantly when in cells treated with cisplatin in combination with saffron extract compared to cisplatin alone. CONCLUSION: Our data establish that the combination of saffron extract as a natural anticancer substance with cisplatin leads to improved cell toxicity of cisplatin as an anticancer agent. Therefore, the saffron extract could be potentially used as an additive to enable a reduction in cisplatin dosages and its side effects.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of saffron (Crocus sativus L., Iridaceae) herbal tea on happiness in postmenopausal women. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial which was conducted in 2021, 72 postmenopausal women were enrolled and divided into intervention and control groups. The randomization blocks method was used for random allocation, and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was utilized to measure the scores. The intervention included the use of 30 mg of dried stigmas of the saffron plant, which was boiled once (in the morning, in 300 ml of boiling water for 10-15 min) and consumed with white rock candy as one cup of saffron tea daily. To compare the trend of changes and after removing the effect of other variables, generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in any of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics (p > 0.05). The results of paired samples t-test showed that the happiness mean score in the intervention group increased significantly (p < 0.001) from 42.93 ± 8.54 to 61.58 ± 8.24, while in the control group, there was no significant difference between the happiness mean score at the beginning and end of the study (p = 0.861). Also, after applying the treatment program in the intervention group, there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of the happiness mean scores (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Saffron herbal tea had a positive effect on reducing depression and increasing the happiness score; thus, it is recommended that it should be used as a complementary treatment in consultation with the treating physician.

Despite developments in pharmacological treatments for dyslipidemia there are several challenges. Recently some herbs highly considered to control dyslipidemia due to their low toxicity and high potency. In this study we investigated the effects of saffron petals on the lipid profile of dyslipidemia patients as well as several other biochemical blood factors. METHODS: In this double blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial, we used systematic random sampling to divide 40 patients with at least two abnormalities in the following factors: (high-density lipoproteins (HDL) ≤40, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) ≥130, triglycerides (TG) ≥200, total cholesterol (Cho) ≥200), into 2 groups of 21 ones. At the end of the intervention period, serum lipid factors, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urea, creatinin (CR) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) were measured and statistically compared with their values just before the intervention. RESULTS: We found that the saffron petal pills markedly (P < 0.001) decreased the serum lipid levels of patients (TG, Cho and LDL) in the intervention group (113.81 ± 12.93, 56.52 ± 4.68 and 48.28 ± 3.70) as compared to the placebo group (18.42 ± 15.79, 4.57 ± 4.40 and 7.38 ± 3.54). Also, comparing the mean value of differences in two groups before and after the intervention showed significant reduction in TG (113.81 ± 26), Cho (56.53 ± 0.30) and LDL (48.28 ± 4.30) levels (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The saffron petal pills considerably reduced blood serum lipid profile and as well as urea and CR of dyslipidemia patients. So, this plant may be used as a potent phytomedicine for treatment and prevention of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disorders. However, the results indicated that no statistical change was observed in the level of other biochemical blood factors such as ALT, AST, ALP and FBS.",

METHODS: In an experimental study, 12 rats were randomly divided into 2 groups to be evaluated in the prevention phase for 7 weeks. In the prevention phase, the animals were randomly assigned to either fed HFHS + 250 mg/kg saffron (S) or fed with HFHS. Afterward, parts of the liver were excised for histopathologic examination. Plasma concentrations of ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, serum lipids, insulin concentrations, plasma glucose, hs-CRP, and TAC were measured. Moreover, Also, the gene expression of 6 target genes was evaluated, including FAS, ACC1, CPT1 ،PPARα ،DGAT2, and SREBP 1-c at the beginning and end of the study. Also, the differences among groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test for non-normal data and the independent t test for normal data. RESULTS: The prevention phase groups have a significant elevation in body weight ( P = 0.034) and food intake (P = 0.001) of the HFHS group versus HFHS + 250 mg/kg S group. Also, there was a significant difference between groups 1 and 2 for ALT (P = 0.011) and AST (P = 0.010), and TG (P = 0.040). The HFHS group had higher plasma levels of FBS (P = 0.001), insulin (P = 0.035), HOMA-IR (P = 0.032), and lower TAC (P = 0.041) versus the HFHS+ S group. Also, the difference between HFHS + 250 mg/kg S and HFHS for PPARα gene expression was significant (P = 0.030). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that consumption of saffron could prevent developing NAFLD in rats at least partially through modulation in gene expression of PPARα."

      "abstract": "Salinity stress is the second most devastating abiotic factor limiting plant growth and yields. Climate changes have significantly increased salinity levels of soil. Besides improving the physiological responses under stress conditions, jasmonates modulate Mycorrhiza-Plant relationships. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJ) and Funneliformis mosseae (Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) on morphology and improving antioxidant mechanisms in Crocus sativus L. under salinity stress. After inoculation with AM, pre-treated C. sativus corms with MeJ were grown under low, moderate, and severe salinity stress. Intense salinity levels damaged the corm, root, total leaf dry weight, and area. Salinities up to 50 mM increased Proline content and Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, but MeJ increased this trend in proline. Generally, MeJ increased anthocyanins, total soluble sugars, and PPO. Total chlorophyll and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased by salinity. The maximum catalase and SOD activities in + MeJ + AM were 50 and 125 mM, respectively, and the maximum total chlorophyll in -MeJ + AM treatment was 75 mM. Although 20 and 50 mM increased plant growth, using mycorrhiza and jasmonate enhanced this trend. Moreover, these treatments reduced the damage of 75 and 100 mM salinity stress. Using MeJ and AM can improve the growth of saffron under various ranges of salinity stress levels; however, in severe levels like 120 mM, this phytohormone and F. mosseae effects on saffron could be adverse.",

In this study, a luminaire was used at 10-h photoperiod combined 450 nm blue LEDs with 660 nm broad-band red LEDs, which respectively had full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15 nm and 85 nm, in a ratio of blue: red: far-red light = 20%: 62%: 18%. The influence of total daily light integral (TDLI) was evaluated on flowering characteristics, stigma quality, as well as leaf morphological characteristics. The results showed that flower number, daily flowering proportion, stigma dry weight and crocetin esters content were significantly correlated with TDLI (P < 0.01). The increasing TDLI could slightly promote leaf width and leaf area beyond buds, but had no significant effect on bud length and leaf length. Both the average flower number per corm and dried stigma yield was the highest under the 150 mol m-2 TDLI treatment, up to 3.63 and 24.19 mg respectively. The former was 0.7 more than that under original natural light treatment, while the later was 50% higher. Totaling, combining blue LEDs with a broad-band red LEDs of the 150 mol m-2 TDLI was the most favorable condition for flower number and stigma quality of saffron in this study.",

      "abstract": "The ever-rising trend of nitrate leaching from the agricultural production systems is a major risk to the contamination of ground- and surface-waters and should be addressed. But so far, there has been no study on the reduction of nitrate leaching from saffron fields through intercropping. Saffron growers can make a sustainable use of the saffron inter-row spaces through the strategy of winter-wheat/saffron base intercropping system to reduce nitrate leaching. During four years of study, in a set of lysimeters, effects of two cropping systems (saffron mono-cropping and saffron-wheat intercropping), application of two sources of nitrogen (organic cow manure and chemical granular urea) and four irrigation regimes [40, 60, 80, and 100% of the standard crop evapotranspiration (ETc)] on plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake, nitrogen leaching and nitrogen and phosphorus efficiencies were investigated. The optimum irrigation regime was experienced at 60% ETc (with irrigation application efficiency of 60%, equivalent to 100%ETc) where the highest saffron and wheat nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) uptake, nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) harvest indices, nutrient acquisition and use efficiencies, corm, saffron, and grain yields and lowest nitrogen loss was achieved. Moreover, manure application indicated 12, 42, 50 and 46% lower amounts of drained water, leachate nitrate nitrogen concentration, total leached nitrogen and N losses (other than N leaching), respectively, in comparison to the urea source of nitrogen showing the lower risk of groundwater nitrate pollution. Manure application showed 9, 8 and 9% increase in the concentration of corm nitrogen, phosphorus and protein, respectively, in comparison to urea application treatment. Saffron corm and stigma yields, irrigation and economic water productivities, corm nitrogen use efficiency and saffron-plant-nitrogen-acquisition efficiency in manure application surpassed respectively by 21, 25, 20, 17, 39 and 49% compared with the chemical source of nitrogen. Intercropping showed 10, 11, 23 and 64% lower amounts of drained water, nitrate concentration in drainage water, seasonal leached nitrate and N losses (other than N leaching), respectively compared to saffron sole cropping which reduces the risk of groundwaters nitrate contamination. For all the experimental treatments, empirical regression models were derived for estimation of seasonal leached nitrate based on the seasonal drained water. Intercropping saffron with winter wheat, application of organic cow manure and adopting irrigation regime of 60% ETc is an innovative system of saffron production which mitigates the risk of groundwater nitrate contamination and increases irrigation and economic water productivities. Saffron growers can make sustainable and clean use of the inter-row spaces of the saffron crop to grow winter wheat in order to obtain higher economic water productivity and lower groundwater nitrate pollution, and it is highly recommended to maintain a sustainable environment."

      "abstract": "Flowering in saffron is a highly complex process regulated by the synchronized action of environmental cues and endogenous signals. Hormonal regulation of flowering is a very important process controlling flowering in several plants, but it has not been studied in saffron. Flowering in saffron is a continual process completed in months with distinct developmental phases, mainly divided into flowering induction and flower organogenesis/formation. In the present study, we investigated how phytohormones affect the flowering process at different developmental stages. The results suggest that different hormones differentially affect flower induction and formation in saffron. The exogenous treatment of flowering competent corms with abscisic acid (ABA) suppressed both floral induction and flower formation, whereas some other hormones, like auxins (indole acetic acid, IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA), behaved contrarily at different developmental stages. IAA promoted flower induction, while GA suppressed it; however, GA promoted flower formation, whereas IAA suppressed it. Cytokinin (kinetin) treatment suggested its positive involvement in flower induction and flower formation. The expression analysis of floral integrator and homeotic genes suggests that ABA might suppress floral induction by suppressing the expression of the floral promoter (LFY, FT3) and promoting the expression of the floral repressor (SVP) gene. Additionally, ABA treatment also suppressed the expression of the floral homeotic genes responsible for flower formation. GA reduces the expression of flowering induction gene LFY, while IAA treatment upregulated its expression. In addition to these genes, a flowering repressor gene, TFL1-2, was also found to be downregulated in IAA treatment. Cytokinin promotes flowering induction by increasing the expression levels of the LFY gene and decreasing the TFL1-2 gene expression. Moreover, it improved flower organogenesis by increasing the expression of floral homeotic genes. Overall, the results suggest that hormones differently regulate flowering in saffron via regulating floral integrator and homeotic gene expression."

      "abstract": "The usage of seaweed extracts in cropping systems is gaining attention nowadays due to their distinct bioactive properties. This study aims to assess how saffron (Crocus sativus L.) corm production was affected by seaweed extract through different application modes. The study was conducted at the CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur, HP, India, during the autumn-winter agricultural cycle. Five treatments using a combination of Kappaphycus and Sargassum seaweed extracts were replicated five times in a randomized block design. Treatments that were examined include T1: Control, T2: Corm dipping @ 5% seaweed extract, T3: Foliar spray @ 5% seaweed extract, T4: Drenching @ 5% seaweed extract, and T5: Corm dipping + foliar spray @ 5% seaweed extract. Seaweed extract, when applied to saffron plants (T5: Corm dipping + foliar spray @ 5% seaweed extract) resulted in significantly higher growth parameters along with the higher dry weight of stem, leaves, corms, and total roots per corm. Corm production, viz., the number of daughter corms and corm weight per m2 was significantly affected by seaweed extract application, with the maximum value recorded with treatment T5. Biochemical parameters chlorophyll, carotenoids, and photosynthetic rate were higher in T5, while nutrient concentration was lowest in this treatment. Seaweed extracts improved corm production, making it a feasible alternative to limiting the application of conventional fertilizers, attenuating the effects on the environment, and enhancing corm number and weight."

      "abstract": "Saffron treatment is a broad-spectrum therapy used for several retinal diseases, and its effectiveness depends on a particular molecular composition (REPRON® saffron). Its production requires specific crops and procedures that, together with low yields, make this spice expensive. To reduce costs, the use of hydroponic crops is gradually increasing. In this study, we tested the protective properties of a hydroponic saffron (sH) batch in models of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) degeneration. ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with 40 µg/mL saffron and exposed to different types of damage: excess light and retinol (LE + RET) or oxidative stress (H2O2). After analyzing the composition of all saffron types with spectroscopy, we performed cell viability and immunofluorescence analysis for both protocols. We compared the sH results with those of a validated batch of saffron REPRON® (sR) and those of a saffron non-REPRON® (sNR) batch. sH and sR, which we found had the same chemical composition, were more effective than sNR in increasing cell survival and attenuating the morphological changes related to apoptosis. In conclusion, hydroponic culturing is a suitable strategy to produce high-quality saffron to reduce costs and increase the accessibility of this promising treatment for retinal degeneration.",

This metabolic disorder can trigger pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. In this regard, statins currently represent the main pharmacological therapy, but their contraindications and side effects limit their use. This is stimulating the search for new therapeutic strategies. In this work, we investigated in HepG2 cells the hypolipidemic potential of a picrocrocin-enriched fraction, analyzed by high-resolution 1H NMR and obtained from a saffron extract, the stigmas of Crocus sativus L., a precious spice that has already displayed interesting biological properties. Spectrophotometric assays, as well as expression level of the main enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, have highlighted the interesting hypolipidemic effects of this natural compound; they seem to be exerted through a non-statin-like mechanism. Overall, this work provides new insights into the metabolic effects of picrocrocin, thus confirming the biological potential of saffron and paving the way for in vivo studies that could validate this spice or its phytocomplexes as useful adjuvants in balancing blood lipid homeostasis.",

We aimed to synthesize copper, nitrogen-doped carbon dots (Cu, N-CDs) from saffron and investigated their effects on HCT-116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. MAIN METHODS: CDs were synthesized by hydrothermal method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. HCT-116 and HT-29 cells were incubated with saffron, N-CDs, and Cu, N-CDs for 24 and 48 h for cell viability. Cellular uptake and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Oil Red O staining was used to monitor lipid accumulation. Apoptosis was evaluated using acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) assay. The expression of miRNA-182 and miRNA-21 was measured by Q-PCR, while the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) activity was calculated by colorimetric methods. KEY FINDINGS: CDs were successfully prepared and characterized. Cell viability decreased in the treated cells dose- and time-dependently. HCT-116 and HT-29 cells uptook Cu, N-CDs with a high level of ROS generation. The Oil Red O staining showed lipid accumulation. Concomitant with an up-regulation of apoptotic genes (p < 0.05), AO/PI staining showed increased apoptosis in the treated cells. In comparison to control cells, NO generation, and miRNA-182 and miRNA-21 expression significantly changed in the Cu, N-CDs treated cells (p < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: The results indicated that Cu, N-CDs could inhibit CRC cells through the induction of ROS generation and apoptosis.",

Combination with other agents may improve the outcomes. This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b trial investigated the combination of sitravatinib, a spectrum-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, plus anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC were enrolled (Cohorts A, B, F, H, and I; N=22-24 per cohort). Cohorts A and F included patients previously treated with systemic therapy, with anti-PD-(L)1-resistant/refractory non-squamous (cohort A) or squamous (cohort F) disease. Cohort B included patients previously treated with systemic therapy, with anti-PD-(L)1-naïve non-squamous disease. Cohorts H and I included patients without prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease, no prior anti-PD-(L)1/immunotherapy, with PD-L1-positive non-squamous (cohort H) or squamous (cohort I) histology. Patients received sitravatinib 120 mg orally one time per day plus tislelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, until study withdrawal, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary endpoint was safety/tolerability among all treated patients (N=122). Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed tumor responses and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 10.9 months (range: 0.4-30.6). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 98.4% of the patients, with ≥Grade 3 TRAEs in 51.6%. TRAEs led to discontinuation of either drug in 23.0% of the patients. Overall response rate was 8.7% (n/N: 2/23; 95% CI: 1.1% to 28.0%), 18.2% (4/22; 95% CI: 5.2% to 40.3%), 23.8% (5/21; 95% CI: 8.2% to 47.2%), 57.1% (12/21; 95% CI: 34.0% to 78.2%), and 30.4% (7/23; 95% CI: 13.2% to 52.9%) in cohorts A, F, B, H, and I, respectively. Median duration of response was not reached in cohort A and ranged from 6.9 to 17.9 months across other cohorts. Disease control was achieved in 78.3-90.9% of the patients. Median PFS ranged from 4.2 (cohort A) to 11.1 months (cohort H). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC, sitravatinib plus tislelizumab was tolerable for most patients, with no new safety signals and overall safety profiles consistent with known profiles of these agents. Objective responses were observed in all cohorts, including in patients naïve to systemic and anti-PD-(L)1 treatments, or with anti-PD-(L)1 resistant/refractory disease. Results support further investigation in selected NSCLC populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03666143.",
