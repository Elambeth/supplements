      "abstract": "To upgrade the utilization of Syzygium samarangense in food industries, the key biological component, i.e., polysaccharide, was extracted from the fruit by alkaline treatment, and its structural characteristics, physicochemical properties, gelling properties and biological activities were investigated. The findings demonstrated that the alkaline-extracted S. samarangense polysaccharide (SSP-AK) predominantly exists as a pectic polysaccharide with a high rhamnogalacturonan-I domain. The monosaccharide composition primarily includes rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, and arabinose. The molecular weight distribution of SSP-AK was characterized by two peaks, with fraction 1 exhibiting a high molecular weight of 7658 kDa and fraction 2 exhibiting a molecular weight of 345.3 kDa. Meanwhile, SSP-AK exhibited excellent rheological behavior and gelling properties upon Ca2+-induced gelation, which may be related to its relatively low degree of esterification of 41.3%. Further studies revealed that higher concentrations of pectin and Ca2+ led to the formation of stronger gels. The SSP-AK gels exhibited superior rheological properties, increased hardness, enhanced water-holding capacity, and a more compact network structure than the other gels. Moreover, SSP-AK exhibited significant in vitro antioxidant activity and immunomodulatory effects, including significantly enhancing the DPPH and ABTS radical-scavenging abilities and production of NO, IL-6, and TNF-α in RAW264.7 cell models. This study enhances the understanding of S. samarangense cell wall polysaccharides and may facilitate their application in the development of functional and health-oriented food products."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Using dietary interventions to steer the metabolic output of the gut microbiota towards specific health-promoting metabolites is often challenging due to interpersonal variation in treatment responses. METHODS: In this study, we combined the ex vivo SIFR® (Systemic Intestinal Fermentation Research) technology with untargeted metabolite profiling to investigate the impact of carrot-derived rhamnogalacturonan-I (cRG-I) on ex vivo metabolite production by the gut microbiota of 24 human adults. RESULTS: The findings reveal that at a dose equivalent to 1.5 g/d, cRG-I consistently promoted indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) production (+45.8% increase) across all subjects. At a dose equivalent to 0.3 g/d, increased IPA production was also observed (+14.6%), which was comparable to the effect seen for 1.5 g/d inulin (10.6%). IPA has been shown to provide protection against diseases affecting the gut and multiple organs. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation (R = 0.65, padjusted = 6.1 × 10-16) between the increases in IPA levels and the absolute levels of Bifidobacterium longum, a producer of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), an intermediate in IPA production. Finally, the community modulation score, a novel diversity index, demonstrated that cRG-I maintained a high α-diversity which has previously been linked to elevated IPA production. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the ex vivo SIFR® experiment mirrored clinical outcomes and provided novel insights into the impact of cRG-I on the gut microbiome function. Importantly, we demonstrated that cRG-I promotes tryptophan conversion into IPA via gut microbiome modulation, thus conferring benefits via amino acid derived metabolites extending beyond those previously reported for short chain fatty acids (SCFA) resulting from carbohydrate fermentation."

      "abstract": "This work investigated a sustainable and efficient approach of pectin extraction for banana peel waste valorisation and studied the influence of banana ripening stages (RS at 2,5 and 7). Although pectin content in banana peel raw material decreased during ripening, pectin extraction was favoured. The highest alcohol-insoluble solids (AIS) yield (12.5%) was achieved at 70 °C, 15 mins from RS 7 peel. All extracts were homogalacturan-rich with some rhamnogalacturonan-I content (showing HGA/RG-I ratio > 2) with varied degree of methylation (DM). The highest HGA content (837.2 mg/g AIS) and HGA/RG-I ratio (9.9) were achieved at 110 °C, 0 mins from RS 7, suggesting its promising application as gelling agent. The highest RG-I content (111.1 mg/g AIS) were obtained at 110 °C, 5 mins from RS 7, which was comparable with the pectin with reported prebiotic ability isolated from the literature, suggesting its potential application in novel products.",

      "abstract": "Proline metabolism plays a crucial role in both environmental stress responses and plant growth. However, the specific mechanism by which proline contributes to abiotic stress processes remains to be elucidated. In this study, we utilized atrzf1 (Arabidopsis thaliana ring zinc finger 1) as a parental line for T-DNA tagging mutagenesis and identified a suppressor mutant of atrzf1, designated proline content alterative 31 (pca31). The pca31 mutant suppressed the insensitivity of atrzf1 to dehydration stress during early seedling growth. Using Thermal Asymmetric Interlaced-PCR, we found that the T-DNA of pca31 was inserted into the promoter region of the At2g22620 gene, which encodes the cell wall enzyme rhamnogalacturonan lyase 1 (RGL1). Enzymatic assays indicated that RGL1 exhibited rhamnogalacturonan lyase activity, influencing cell wall pectin composition. The decrease in RGL1 gene expression suppressed the transcriptomic perturbation of the atrzf1 mutant. Silencing of the RGL1 gene in atrzf1 resulted in a sensitive phenotype similar to pca31 under osmotic stress conditions. Treatment with mannitol, salt, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid induced RGL1 expression. Furthermore, we uncovered that RGL1 plays a role in modulating root growth and vascular tissue development. Molecular, physiological, and genetic experiments revealed that the positive modulation of RGL1 during abiotic stress was linked to the AtRZF1 pathway. Taken together, these findings establish that pca31 acts as a suppressor of atrzf1 in abiotic stress responses through proline and cell wall metabolisms.",

Here, we confirmed experimentally the fundamental possibility of creating composite protein-polysaccharide hydrogels based on non-degrading rhamnogalacturonan I (RG) and fibrin as a delivery vehicle for antitumor RNase binase. The method is based on enzymatic polymerization of fibrin in the presence of RG with the inclusion of liposomes, containing an encapsulated enzyme drug, into the gel network. The proposed method for fabricating a gel matrix does not require the use of cytotoxic chemical cross-linking agents and divalent cations, and contains completely biocompatible and biodegradable components. The process proceeds under physiological conditions, excluding the effect of high temperatures, organic solvents and ultrasound on protein components. Immobilization of therapeutic enzyme binase in the carrier matrix by encapsulating it in liposomes made from uncharged lipid made it possible to achieve its prolonged release with preservation of activity for a long time. The release time of binase from the composite carrier can be regulated by variation of the fibrin and RG concentration.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (Ginseng) has traditionally been used to treat diabetes. Polysaccharide is the main active component of ginseng, and has been proved to have hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the effect and the potential mechanism of rhamnogalacturonan-I enriched pectin (GPS-1) from steamed ginseng on lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GPS-1 was prepared by water extraction, ion-exchange and gel chromatography. High-glucose/high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin was used to establish T2DM rat models, and lipid levels in serum and liver were tested. 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to detect the changes of gut microbiota and metabolites. The protein and mRNA levels of lipid synthesis-related genes were detected by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The polyphagia, polydipsia, weight loss, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in T2DM rats were alleviated after GPS-1 intervention. GPS-1 modulated the gut microbiota composition of T2DM rats, increased the levels of short-chain fatty acids, and promoted the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide tyrosine tyrosine. Further, GPS-1 activated AMP-activated protein kinases, phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase, reduced the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and fatty acid synthases in T2DM rats. CONCLUSIONS: The regulation effects of GPS-1 on lipid metabolism in T2DM rats are related to the regulation of gut microbiota and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase pathway.",

      "abstract": "The molecular basis of cell-cell adhesion in woody tissues is not known. Xylem cells in wood particles of hybrid poplar (Populus tremula × P. alba cv. INRA 717-1B4) were separated by oxidation of lignin with acidic sodium chlorite when combined with extraction of xylan and rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) using either dilute alkali or a combination of xylanase and RG-lyase. Acidic chlorite followed by dilute alkali treatment enables cell-cell separation by removing material from the compound middle lamellae between the primary walls. Although lignin is known to contribute to adhesion between wood cells, we found that removing lignin is a necessary but not sufficient condition to effect complete cell-cell separation in poplar lines with various ratios of syringyl:guaiacyl lignin. Transgenic poplar lines expressing an Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding an RG-lyase (AtRGIL6) showed enhanced cell-cell separation, increased accessibility of cellulose and xylan to hydrolytic enzyme activities, and increased fragmentation of intact wood particles into small cell clusters and single cells under mechanical stress. Our results indicate a novel function for RG-I, and also for xylan, as determinants of cell-cell adhesion in poplar wood cell walls. Genetic control of RG-I content provides a new strategy to increase catalyst accessibility and saccharification yields from woody biomass for biofuels and industrial chemicals.",

RG-I pectin cannot be extracted the same way as commercial homogalacturan-rich pectin using hot acid. Therefore, this study has explored several alternative methods, including microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and conventional-solvent extraction (CSE) at atmospheric pressure using different solvents, and microwave-assisted hydrothermal extraction (MAHE) under pressure using water. No conclusive differences in microwave and conventional heating were found with heating rate controlled. The optimum treatment times of both MAE and CSE at 90 °C atmospheric pressure and regardless of the solvents used were 120 min; however, MAHE at 130 °C under pressure can dramatically reduce the time to 10 min. Alcohol-insoluble solids (AIS) extracted using pH13 solvent by MAE had both the highest RG-I yield at 25.3% and purity at 260.2 mg/g AIS, followed by AIS extracts using water by MAHE with 7.5% and 166.7 mg/g AIS respectively."

BCE-I mainly consisted of galactose and arabinose, whereas BCE-II mainly consisted of galacturonic acid and rhamnose, and BCE-III mainly consisted of rhamnose and galactose. Of the three fractions, stimulation of murine peritoneal macrophages by BCE-I showed the greatest enhancement of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-6 secretion. In addition, intravenous (i.v.) administration of BCE-I enhanced the lethal activity of natural killer (NK) cells on YAC-1 tumor cells significantly and dose-dependently in an ex vivo experiment of NK cell activity. In an experimental model using lung metastasis of Colon26-M3.1 carcinoma cells, prophylactic i.v. and oral administration of BCE-I significantly and dose-dependently inhibited lung metastatic activity. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of BCE-1 on lung metastasis partially disappeared when NK cell function was removed through treatment of rabbit anti-asialo GM1. These results indicated that BCE-I has potent antitumor metastatic activity, and that its anti-metastatic activity has relevance to the stimulation of NK and other immune cells.",

In this manuscript, rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI)-rich pectins prepared from ginseng pectin were investigated for their effect on cell migration. The results indicated that the combination of homogalacturonan (HG) and RGI-rich pectins exerted stronger effects than either HG- or RGI-rich pectin alone. Further studies revealed that the effects of HG- and RGI-rich pectins were dependent on pretreatment, which caused alterations in cell morphologies such as cell size and shape, focal adhesion, and the organization of actin filaments, suggesting that HG and RGI pectins exert synergistic effects on cell migration, likely through different ways. Morphological data and quantitative cell adhesion and spreading assays showed that HG- and RGI-rich pectin treatment decreased cell adhesion and cell spreading on the substratum, suggesting that HG- and RGI-rich pectins may exert their effects on cell migration via decreasing cell adhesion and cell spreading. Additionally, we showed that L-929 cells expressed little galectin-3 (Gal-3) and that lactose, an inhibitor of Gal-3 did not block the activities of HG- and RGI-rich pectins, implicating that cell migration inhibited by pectin did not correlate to Gal-3.",

Monosaccharide compositional analysis of PPc revealed the presence of rhamnose, galacturonic acid, galactose, and arabinose in a molar ratio of 7.4: 25: 28: 2.6. Structural and linkage analysis by 1D NMR (1H NMR and 13C NMR), and 2D NMR (COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, and elevated temperature HMBC) suggested that PPc was a RG-I-like pectic polysaccharide, branched at the C-4 of some of the (about 29% of) rhamnosyl units, with relatively long β-1,4-d-galactan side chains to which were attached, through the C-3 of β-d-Gal, terminal non reducing α-Araf units. The results of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) show that PPc binds to two types of lectin, Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 (RCA120) and Galectin-3 (Gal-3). These binding studies show quick association and slow dissociation with a moderate binding affinity between PPc and Gal-3 of 1.26μM. The interaction between PPc and Gal-3 suggest the potential use of pumpkin pectic polysaccharide as a Gal-3 inhibitor in functional food or drug development applications.",

A new source for delivery is plant-polysaccharide based delivery platforms such as Rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I). In the gastro-intestinal tract the RG-I is only degraded by the action of the colonic microflora. For assessment of potential drug delivery properties, RG-I based microcapsules (~1 μm in diameter) were prepared by an interfacial poly-addition reaction. The cross-linked capsules were loaded with a fluorescent dye (model drug). The capsules showed negligible and very little in vitro release when subjected to media simulating gastric and intestinal fluids, respectively. However, upon exposure to a cocktail of commercial RG-I cleaving enzymes, ~ 9 times higher release was observed, demonstrating that the capsules can be opened by enzymatic degradation. The combined results suggest a potential platform for targeted drug delivery in the terminal gastro-intestinal tract.",

Both RG I and oligo-RG I have stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp., with oligo-RG I hydrolysates being more selectively fermented by these beneficial bacteria. Furthermore, none of RG I nor its hydrolysates increased the populations of Bacteroidetes and Clostridium leptum. Total amounts of short chain fatty acids, generated upon the fermentation of oligo-RG I, were higher than those obtained with its parent RG I and the positive control (fructooligosaccharides).

Microwave power and solid/liquid ratio exhibited a significant adverse interactive effect on the yield. Galactose content of extracted polysaccharides can be modulated by compromising between KOH concentration and extraction time, which exhibited adverse interaction. Optimum conditions were identified using the established predicted models and consisted of treatment of potato cell wall at solid/liquid ratio of 2.9% (w/v) with 1.5M KOH under microwave power of 36.0 W for 2.0 min. Yield of intact galactan-rich RG I of 21.6% and productivity of 192.0 g/Lh were achieved.

Two techniques, DLS and NMR, with different principles of diffusion experiment were used to establish the reasons for this property of RG-I. Three possible types of particles were revealed by DLS depending on the concentration of the RG-I and G1 solutions (2-2.5, 15-20, and 150-200 nm). It was determined by BPP-LED experiments that the backbone of the RG-I was 1.3-1.9-fold more mobile than the side chains.

      "abstract": "Pectin has been shown to inhibit the actions of galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding protein associated with cancer progression. The structural features of pectin involved in this activity remain unclear. We investigated the effects of different ginseng pectins on galectin-3 action. The rhamnogalacturonan I-rich pectin fragment, RG-I-4, potently inhibited galectin-3-mediated hemagglutination, cancer cell adhesion and homotypic aggregation, and binding of galectin-3 to T-cells. RG-I-4 specifically bound to the carbohydrate recognition domain of galectin-3 with a dissociation constant of 22.2 nm, which was determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The structure-activity relationship of RG-I-4 was investigated by modifying the structure through various enzymatic and chemical methods followed by activity tests. The results showed that (a) galactan side chains were essential to the activity of RG-I-4, whereas arabinan side chains positively or negatively regulated the activity depending on their location within the RG-I-4 molecule. (b) The activity of galactan chain was proportional to its length up to 4 Gal residues and largely unchanged thereafter. (c) The majority of galactan side chains in RG-I-4 were short with low activities. (d) The high activity of RG-I-4 resulted from the cooperative action of these side chains. (e) The backbone of the molecule was very important to RG-I-4 activity, possibly by maintaining a structural conformation of the whole molecule. (f) The isolated backbone could bind galectin-3, which was insensitive to lactose treatment. The novel discovery that the side chains and backbone play distinct roles in regulating RG-I-4 activity is valuable for producing highly active pectin-based galectin-3 inhibitors.",

The extraction yield increased as the concentration of alkaline solution was increased from 0.5 M (22-24%) to 2 M (53-56%). The yield of 38% obtained upon the enzymatic treatment was similar to those observed with 1M alkaline solutions. The results reveal the high debranching of arabinan side chains of RG I as compared to the galactan ones under harsh alkaline conditions. The molecular weight distribution shows that the enzymatic extraction led to the highest proportion of high-molecular weight polysaccharides (>500 kDa; 62.2%). According to monosaccharide pattern, the weak acidic fractions of high alkaline (1-2 M)-based polysaccharide extracts was the most enriched with galactan-rich RG I. Using milder conditions (enzyme and weak alkaline), two RG I populations with low and high linked homogalacturonan fragments were recovered in the weak and strong acidic fractions, respectively. The structure of galactan-rich RG I was confirmed by H(1) NMR spectroscopy analysis.",

The defective locus was found to be allelic to the mum2-1 and mum2-2 mutants. Map-based cloning showed that MUCILAGE-MODIFIED2 (MUM2) encodes the putative beta-D-galactosidase BGAL6. Activity assays demonstrated that one of four major beta-D-galactosidase activities present in developing siliques is absent in mum2 mutants. No difference was observed in seed coat epidermal cell structure between wild-type and mutant seed; however, weakening of the outer tangential cell wall by chemical treatment resulted in the release of mucilage from mum2 seed coat epidermal cells, and the mum2 mucilage only increased slightly in volume, relative to the wild type. Consistent with the absence of beta-D-galactosidase activity in the mutant, the inner layer of mucilage contained more Gal. The allocation of polysaccharides between the inner and outer mucilage layers was also modified in mum2. Mass spectrometry showed that rhamnogalacturonan I in mutant mucilage had more branching between rhamnose and hexose residues relative to the wild type. We conclude that the MUM2/BGAL6 beta-D-galactosidase is required for maturation of rhamnogalacturonan I in seed mucilage by the removal of galactose/galactan branches, resulting in increased swelling and extrusion of the mucilage on seed hydration.",

Using two-step discontinuous sucrose step gradients, galactosyltransferase (GalT) activity that synthesized 70%-methanol-insoluble products from UDP-[(14)C]Gal was detected in both the 0.5 M sucrose fraction and the 0.25/1.1 M sucrose interface. The former fraction contained mainly soluble proteins and the latter was enriched in Golgi vesicles that contained most of the UDPase activity, a Golgi marker. By gel-filtration analysis, products of 180-2000 Da were found in the soluble fraction, whereas in the Golgi-enriched fraction the products were larger than 80 kDa and could be digested with rhamnogalacturonan lyase and beta(1,4) endogalactanase to yield smaller rhamnogalacturonan oligomers, galactobiose and galactose. The endogalactanase requires beta(1-->4)galactans with at least three galactosyl residues for cleavage, indicating that the enzyme(s) present in the 0.25/1.1 M Suc interface transferred one or more galactosyl residues to pre-existing beta(1-->4)galactans producing RG-I side chains in total longer than a trimer. Thus, the beta(1-->4)GalT activity that elongates beta(1-->4)-linked galactan on RG-I was located in the Golgi apparatus. This beta(1-->4)GalT activity was not reduced after treatment of the Golgi vesicles with proteinase, but approximately 75% of the activity was lost after treatment with proteinase in the presence of Triton X-100. In addition, the beta(1-->4)GalT activity was recovered in the detergent phase after treatment of Golgi vesicles with Triton X-114. Taken together, these observations supported the view that the RG-I beta(1-->4)GalT that elongates beta(1-->4)galactan was mainly located in the Golgi apparatus and integrated into the membrane with its catalytic site facing the lumen.",

Incubation of the microsomal membranes in the presence of UDP-[14C]galactose resulted in a radioactive product insoluble in 70% methanol. The product released only [14C]galactose upon acid hydrolysis. Treatment of the product with Aspergillus niger endo-1,4-beta-galactanase released 65-70% of the radioactivity to a 70%-methanol-soluble fraction. To a minor extent, [14C]galactose was also incorporated into proteins, however these galactoproteins were not a substrate for Aspergillus niger endo-1,4-beta-galactanase. Thus, the majority of the 14C-labelled product was 1,4-beta-galactan. Compounds released by the endo-1,4-beta-galactanase treatment were mainly [14C]galactose and [14C]galactobiose, indicating that the synthesized 1,4-beta-galactan was longer than a trimer. In vitro synthesis of 1,4-beta-galactan was most active with 6-d-old cells, which are in the middle of the linear growth phase. The optimal synthesis occurred at pH 6.0 in the presence of 7.5 mM Mn2+. Aspergillus aculeatus rhamnogalacturonase A digested at least 50% of the labelled product to smaller fragments of approx. 14 kDa, suggesting that the synthesized [14C]galactan was attached to the endogenous rhamnogalacturonan I. When rhamnogalacturonase A digests of the labelled product were subsequently treated with endo-1,4-beta-galactanase, radioactivity was not only found as [14C]galactose or [14C]galactobiose but also as larger fragments. The larger fragments were likely the [14C]galactose or [14C]galactobiose still attached to the rhamnogalacturonan backbone since treatment with beta-galactosidase together with endo-1,4-beta-galactanase digested all radioactivity to the fraction eluting as [14C]galactose. The data indicate that the majority of the [14C]galactan was attached directly to the rhamnose residues in rhamnogalacturonan I. Thus, isolated microsomal membranes contain enzyme activities to both initiate and elongate 1,4-beta-galactan sidechains in the endogenous pectic rhamnogalacturonan I.",

Treatment of RG-I with a purified endo-(1-->5)-alpha-L-arabinanase released a series of arabinose-containing oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization (dp's) between 2 and 20. These oligosaccharides were shown, by glycosyl-linkage composition analysis, to contain terminal, 5-, and (3-->5)-linked Araf residues. These results provide evidence that a branched arabinan is attached to the backbone of RG-I. RG-I was freed of 95% of its arabinosyl residues by treating the polysaccharide with a combination of endo-(1-->5)-alpha-L-arabinanase and alpha-L-arabinosidase. No galacturonic acid was released by these enzymes, which is evidence that the arabinosyl-containing portions of the side chains do not contain galactosyluronic acid residues. The galactose-containing portions of the side chains of RG-I were not fragmented by an endo-(1-->4)-beta-D-galactanase. However, approximately 85% of the galactose and small amounts of galacturonic acid were released by digestion of arabinose-depleted RG-I with a combination of endo- and exo-beta-D-galactanases. The galacturonic acid may have been released by small amounts of an exo-alpha-galactosyluronidase contaminating the galactanases. Treatment of RG-I with this mixture of endo- and exo-glycanases resulted in a relatively size-homogeneous, almost side chain-free backbone composed of the O-acetylated diglycosyl repeating unit -->4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap. A combination of 1H NMR spectroscopy and periodate oxidation established that the backbone repeating unit contained a single O-acetyl substituent on C-2 or C-3 of each galactosyluronic acid residue.",

      "abstract": "Considerable information has been obtained about the primary structures of suspension-cultured sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cell-wall pectic polysaccharides, i.e. rhamnogalacturonan I, rhamnogalacturonan II, and homogalacturonan. However, these polysaccharides, which are solubilized from the walls by endo-alpha-1,4-polygalacturonase, account for only about half of the pectic polysaccharides known to be present in sycamore cell walls. We now report that, after exhaustive treatment with endo-alpha-1,4-polygalacturonase, additional pectic polysaccharides were extracted from sycamore cell walls by treatment with Na(2)CO(3) at 1 and 22 degrees C. These previously uncharacterized polysaccharides accounted for approximately 4% of the cell wall. Based on the glycosyl and glycosyl-linkage compositions and the nature of the products obtained by treating the quantitatively predominant NaCO(3)-extracted polysaccharides with lithium metal dissolved in ethylenediamine, the polysaccharides were found to strongly resemble rhamnogalacturonan I. However, unlike rhamnogalacturonan I that characteristically had equal amounts of 2- and 2,4-linked rhamnosyl residues in its backbone, the polysaccharides extracted in Na(2)CO(3) at 1 degrees C had markedly disparate ratios of 2- to 2,4-linked rhamnosyl residues. We concluded that polysaccharides similar to rhamnogalacturonan I but with different degrees of branching are present in the walls of suspension-cultured sycamore cells."
