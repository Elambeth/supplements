      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulators of gene expression, impacting a wide range of biological processes. Their dysregulation can result in pathological changes and contribute to the development of various disorders. This study aims to evaluate the expression of selected miRNAs in duodenal tissue of paediatric patients with active celiac disease (CD), investigate the role of dysregulated miRNAs in disease pathogenesis and assess the changes in their expression profile in response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included newly diagnosed celiac patients (n = 20), celiac patients adhering to a GFD (n = 17) and a control group (n = 29). The miRNA expression in duodenal samples was quantified by real-time PCR. Dysregulated miRNAs were analysed for functional enrichment in molecular pathways. Our results identified 8 dysregulated miRNAs in celiac patients: miR-155-5p (upregulated) and hsa-miR-22-5p, hsa-miR-192-5p, hsa-miR-338-3p, hsa-miR-31-5p, hsa-miR-31-3p, hsa-miR-215-5p and hsa-miR-378d (downregulated). Pathway analysis implicated these miRNAs in regulating various signaling pathways related to inflammation, immune response and intercellular junctions, all of which are relevant to the pathogenesis of CD. Moreover, miR-31-3p was upregulated in CD patients on a GFD, exhibiting a negative correlation with the duration of GFD. For other miRNAs, the level of expression in CD patients adhering to a GFD was restored to levels similar to those observed in the control group. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study reveals significant changes in miRNA expression in duodenal biopsies from paediatric CD patients and how these patterns shift with dietary intervention. Understanding the interactions among dysregulated miRNAs may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for managing CD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease affecting 1.4% of the population worldwide. The only treatment for this condition is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Although the complexity of this condition is recognised, the definitive follow-up strategy and long-term management have still not been developed in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia. This meta-synthesis aimed to explore the experiences of patients living with CD who follow the GFD in the UK and Australia. METHODS: A systematic search for primary qualitative literature related to experiences of patients with CD on a GFD and a meta-synthesis of the results were conducted. Healthcare-relevant online databases were screened: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Scopus, followed by reference list searching. A defined inclusion criteria were used to identify relevant studies. The data synthesis from the literature followed the thematic synthesis approach. A clear description of the methodology and peer review were applied to ensure transparency. RESULTS: A total of 286 studies were screened for eligibility. Of those, six studies met the inclusion criteria. The experiences of 198 patients living with CD were analysed and reported. Five analytical themes emerged through the thematic synthesis process: acceptance and adaptation, dietary burden, cost burden, socialising, and importance of support. All themes were found to impact patients' quality of life (QoL). The overall quality of the reviewed studies was described as good. CONCLUSION: This meta-synthesis revealed insights into the daily experiences of patients with CD in adhering to a GFD in the UK and Australia, being the first secondary qualitative study to explore this phenomenon. It highlighted the need for the development of defined strategies for patient follow-up to provide holistic care, considering the complexities of this condition and its impact on both physical and psychological domains.",

RESULTS: Overall, 96 of 130 children (74%) had mucosal recovery, including 48% children (12/25) who were assessed within 3 months. Musculoskeletal symptoms at diagnosis were the only clinical characteristic associated with persistent enteropathy. DISCUSSION: While mucosal recovery can occur within months, more than a quarter of children with CeD had persistent enteropathy within 15 months of treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia and related disorders (SRD) are characterized by positive and negative symptoms, such as anhedonia and avolition. There are no current FDA approved treatments for negative symptoms, which is a critical gap in our treatment of people with SRDs, since they are a major determinant of functional impairment. An emerging literature suggests that SRDs have a relationship with immune function and inflammation. Recently an SRD subgroup with high inflammation and elevated levels of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) of immunoglobulin G type (IgG) has been characterized. Negative symptom improvement has been previously observed with gluten removal in this subgroup in two small clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a 5-week confirmatory double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a gluten free diet (GFD) versus gluten-containing diet (GCD) for negative symptoms in people with SRD who have elevated AGA IgG (NCT03183609). Participants were between the ages of 18-64 years, had baseline negative symptoms and a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Those included were screened for an AGA IgG >20 U, no serologic evidence of celiac disease, and stable antipsychotic treatment and dose. All participants were inpatients, received a GFD and were randomized to 30 grams of gluten or rice flour daily delivered in protein shakes. The Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS) Motivation and Pleasure (MAP) scale was the primary outcome measure. We also examined the CAINS Expressivity (EXP) scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and conducted regular side effect screening and laboratory measures for safety. FINDINGS: Between 2018 and 2024, we included 39 participants (N=21 GFD and N=18 GCD). There was a significant improvement over time in the CAINS MAP (treatment X time df=30.1, F=2.78, p=0.045) in the GFD compared to GCD, but no significant change in the CAINS EXP, the SANS, BPRS or MCCB. The diet was well tolerated; the most frequently occurring side effects were constipation (38.1% GFD, 33.3% GCD), sedation (33.3% GFD, 50% GCD), dry mouth (33.3% GFD, 33.3% GCD), headache (33.3% GFD, 27.8% GCD), and insomnia (33.3% GFD, 27.8% GCD). INTERPRETATION: This is the first large scale double-blind randomized clinical trial in SRD with AGA IgG+. This replication of smaller studies suggests that negative symptoms, particularly anhedonia and avolition may be improved. However, we did not replicate our previous finding of cognitive improvement and COVID-19 likely impacted the extent of improvement in negative symptoms due to quarantines and lockdowns. More work is needed to determine the mechanism of action of gluten removal in this subgroup with hopes of developing new treatment targets for motivational deficits of this illness. FUNDING: This project was funded by NIMH R01 R01MH113617 (DL Kelly PI)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The main treatment for Celiac Disease (CD) is the gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in some CD patients, iron deficiency anemia can be persistent despite a GFD. AIM: In this study, we aim to evaluate the prevalence of anemia in both adults and children with CD at the diagnosis and during the GFD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study including both adults and children with CD, the demographic characteristics and hemoglobin, iron, folate and vitamin B12 levels were retrospectively retrieved from patients' medical records at the time of diagnosis (T0); after 3-5 years (T1) and after 8-10 years (T2) of GFD. RESULTS: 311 CD patients (184 adults and 127 pediatric patients) were included in the study. No difference was observed in the prevalence of anemia in the overall population after 3-5 years of GFD in both adult and pediatric patients compared to the diagnosis. At 8-10 years, in the adult patient's group, a significant reduction in the prevalence of anemia was observed (24% vs. 17.8% p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the GFD and a very long observational period the diagnosis of anemia persists in 17.8% and 4.4% of adult and pediatric patients, respectively. The diagnostic delay (longer in adult patients) and a more pronounced ultrastructural mucosal injury could play a role in the persistence of anemia despite the GFD.",

      "abstract": "The etiology of bone loss in celiac disease (CeD) remains a clinical challenge, with uncertainties present such as the extent of involvement of malabsorption and inflammation-induced osteoresorption processes in development of osteopenia/osteoporosis (OPN/OP), or reasons for failure to achieve healthy bone mass (BMD) even after long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment. This observational prospective study explores the in vitro osteoclastogenic potential of peripheral blood precursors originating from adult active (newly diagnosed and untreated) celiac disease patients (aCeD) and describes the longitudinal changes in osteoclastogenesis after long-term adherence to GFD. To find connections between in vitro observations and in vivo bone metabolism changes, serum levels of 25(OH)D3, PTH, bCTX, PINP, CRP, IL-6, RANKL and OPG were measured before and after GFD and levels of these markers were correlated with the rate of osteoclastogenesis in vitro. OPG and IL-6 showed associations with BMD and/or presence of OPN/OP. Patients after GFD (CeD-GFD) exhibited improved BMD and increased serum 25(OH)D3 levels, alongside reduced bCTX and PINP levels. Compared to healthy donors, aCeD osteoclast genesis in vitro was higher and, surprisingly, remained elevated even in CeD-GFD patients. Negative correlation was found between osteoclastogenesis rate and serum OPG in aCeD, while osteoclastogenesis rate positively correlated with PTH in CeD-GFD. These results highlight OPG as marker for risk of OPN/OP in CeD and suggest that improvement of BMD after GFD is a result of uncoupling between bone metabolism and osteoresorptive action of osteoclasts after GFD.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CeD), also known as gluten enteropathy, is an immune-mediated inflammatory enteropathy triggered by intolerance to gluten. It presents with a spectrum of symptoms, including both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations, as well as neurological symptoms. A review of the literature indicates that 10-22% of patients with CeD present with neurological symptoms. The objective of this study is to assess the influence of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on brain bioelectrical activity and neurological symptoms in children with CeD. Methods: The study was conducted using a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing a comprehensive array of clinical data gathered alongside laboratory test results, questionnaires, and electroencephalogram (EEG) assessments. The study population included 85 children: 18 newly diagnosed cases of CeD patients (NDC), subsequently reassessed after 6 months on a GFD as a celiac disease on diet (CDD); 27 CeD patients on a GFD for over 12 months (CDD2); and 40 healthy individuals in the comparison group (CG). Results: It was observed that over half of the NDC group exhibited neurological symptoms, particularly headaches. Following a six-month period on a GFD, there was a notable reduction in symptom severity. In comparison to the CG, the NDC patient group exhibited a higher prevalence of abnormalities in EEG recordings (p = 0.032), including focal sharp waves or slow waves. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that a GFD has a positive impact on the neurological condition of children with CeD. The clinical improvements correspond with EEG normalization, which supports the hypothesis that dietary intervention plays a role in mitigating CeD-associated neurological dysfunction."

This study aimed to validate the Hellenic version of the Celiac Disease Adherence Test (H-CDAT) to evaluate adherence levels and explore the impact of dietary adherence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL)-both of which have never been objectively assessed in Greek CD patients. METHODS: The study included 102 adult CD patients who completed H-CDAT, diet-related questions, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: H-CDAT demonstrated good psychometric properties and showed multiple strong correlations with HRQoL dimensions. H-CDAT adherence was Good in 38.2%, Moderate in 42.2%, and Poor in 19.6% of patients, despite their perception of effective adherence, with 51% never having visited a dietitian for guidance on a GFD. Patients scored significantly lower across most HRQoL dimensions compared to the general Greek population. When stratified into the three adherence categories, striking differences emerged between Good and Moderate adherence across both physical and mental health domains, highlighting that moderate adherence is not sufficient for optimal health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the critical role of strict GFD adherence in improving overall health and underscore the importance of dietetic intervention for achieving optimal patient outcomes.",

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on HbA1c levels in patients with both type 1 diabetes and CD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, biochemical and clinical information was gathered from 174 children with T1DM from January 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: We assessed 174 children with T1DM (93 girls and 81 boys). Celiac disease was diagnosed in 18 out of 174 cases (10.34%). Height and weight percentiles showed significant differences between children with CD and those without CD (P = 0.015 and P = 0.026, respectively). The average HbA1c in the celiac group was 8.61 ± 2.20 (95% CI: 5.1 - 12.1) prior to GFD therapy. HbA1c was assessed six and twelve months following the initiation of the GFD and was found to be 8.32 ± 1.46 (95% CI: 6 - 9.8) and 8.37 ± 1.67 (95% CI: 6.1 - 10.2), respectively. No significant change in HbA1c was observed before and after therapy (P = 0.501). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic children with CD exhibit lower weight and height compared to those without CD. Gluten-free diet therapy in patients with CD did not affect HbA1c levels."

      "abstract": "Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated chronic enteropathy, with a prevalence of around 1% in the general population and occurring in genetically susceptible individuals after the ingestion of gluten proteins present in wheat, rye and barley. Currently, a strict lifelong gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of treatment of coeliac disease. However, maintaining strict dietary adherence is challenging for many patients, due to the high costs, the highly restrictive nature of the diet and the impact on patients' quality of life. Moreover, a tiny minority of coeliac patients can develop pre-malignant/malignant complications of coeliac disease, a group of conditions, that despite being rare, are still burdened by a poor prognosis due to the lack of effective therapies. Therefore, the development of pharmacological treatments as an alternative to or supportive of a gluten-free diet is still an unmet need. The identification of new pathogenetic targets in the last years has enabled the development of several candidates molecules, many of which have been investigated in phase 2/3 clinical trials. In this narrative review we aim to summarise the investigational therapies that have been evaluated in phase 2/3 trials and provide a critical overview on the latest advances in this field."

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) and eating disorders (EDs) are complex chronic conditions in adolescents, sharing symptoms such as weight change, malnutrition, and gastrointestinal symptoms. CD, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion, is managed through a strict gluten-free diet that can unintentionally foster disordered eating behaviors due to dietary restrictions. Conversely, EDs may mask and complicate CD symptoms, leading to diagnostic delays and treatment challenges. Evidence reveals an increased risk of EDs in CD individuals and vice versa, indicating a potential bidirectional relationship. This review explores the mechanisms and clinical implications of this interplay and proposes integrated screening and care strategies to improve the quality of life for individuals with both conditions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Concurrent type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CeD) pose challenges in insulin dosage adjustments and gluten-free dietary adherence. Urine testing for gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) is a new method to detect gluten exposure within the last 3-12 h. Our aims were to compare gluten-free dietary adherence between T1D + CeD and CeD individuals and evaluate urinary GIP testing in an outpatient setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study included three adult groups: (1) T1D and CeD, (2) CeD only, and (3) T1D only. T1D participants were recruited from outpatient clinics, the CeD group via social media. One urine sample (12 pm-7 pm) was analyzed using a qualitative immunographic GIP test. CeD participants completed 'Celiac Dietary Adherence Test' (CDAT) and 'Celiac Symptom Index' (CSI) questionnaires. IgA anti-transglutaminase 2 (IgA-TG2) and IgG anti-deamidated gliadin (IgG-DGP) serology were also analyzed. RESULTS: 197 participants, mean (SD) age 43 (15) years, were included. Female percentages were: CeD: 90%, T1D + CeD: 64%, and T1D: 47%. Positive urinary GIP was found in 15% (14/96) of T1D + CeD and 0% (0/50) of CeD (p = 0.002). As expected, most T1D only participants had positive urinary GIP (86%, 44/51). CDAT and CSI scores did not differ between T1D + CeD and CeD groups. Positive IgA-TG2 and/or IgG-DGP levels were found in 12% of T1D + CeD and 6% of CeD participants (p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: A single GIP urine test revealed higher gluten exposure in T1D + CeD versus CeD only, questioning dietary adherence in this population. Urinary GIP tests can be useful for clinical follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the gluten-free diet (GFD) has become much more than the dietary treatment for celiac disease. Due to its presumed beneficial effects even in non-celiac subjects, it has become a new fashion statement and it is promoted by some healthcare professionals, social media and marketing strategists. On the other hand, regardless of a proper medical indication, a GFD may present side effects, such as poor palatability, high costs and socio-psychological adversities. Moreover, it can be an obstacle to correct clinical practice and may induce nutritional deficiency due to a low-quality diet. In addition, a GFD can trigger or exacerbate many irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like disorders in predisposed subjects: reactivity to dietary nickel, the increased consumption of FODMAP-rich foods and histamine intolerance seem to frequently play a relevant role. The possible intersections between high-risk foods in these categories of patients, as well as the possible overlaps among IBS-like disorders during GFD, are described. In conclusion, it is advisable to undergo a careful clinical evaluation by a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist (in some cases, also a psychotherapist) before starting and during a GFD, because both benefits and risks are possible. It is also important to take into account IBS-like disorders that can be exacerbated by a GFD and that are still underestimated today.",

Not everyone is able to adapt to the new eating style and may develop maladaptive behaviors. The objective was to evaluate the factors of adherence to the gluten-free diet in people with celiac disease in Paraguay in 2023. METHODOLOGY: We perform an observational, cross-sectional design in adolescent and adult subjects with celiac disease. A telematic questionnaire containing demographic and clinical data was applied. The adherence to the diet was evaluated with the Leffler questionnaire, eating attitudes and behaviors with the CD-FAB instrument, and family support with the family APGAR test. Descriptive and analytical statistics were applied with SPSS Statistics 25™ software. The research respected ethical aspects. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 292 people. The median age was 33 years and predominated the female sex (85.3%). Good adherence to the gluten-free diet was detected in 151 (51.7%) people and good adaptation to it in 164 (56.2%). In 141 cases (48.3%) it was stated that they had family support. The analysis showed that prolonged time since diagnosis and having family support were significantly associated with adherence to the gluten-free diet (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In people with celiac disease, adherence to the gluten-free diet was related to a prolonged time since diagnosis and receiving family support. It is recommended to investigate the causes of maladaptive behaviors to the gluten-free diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Currently, the main treatment for celiac disease (CD) is the gluten-free diet (GFD). This observational cohort study investigated the impact of CD and 1 year of GFD on gut function and microbiome. METHODS: A total of 36 newly diagnosed patients and 36 healthy volunteers (HVs) were studied at baseline and at 12-month follow-up. Small bowel water content (SBWC), whole gut transit time (WGTT), and colon volumes were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Stool sample DNA was subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Species-level abundances and gene functions, including CAZymes (carbohydrate active enzymes) were determined. RESULTS: SBWC was significantly higher in people with CD (157 ± 15 mL) vs (HVs 100 ± 12 mL) (P = .003). WGTT was delayed in people with CD (68 ± 8 hours) vs HVs (41 ± 5 hours) (P = .002). The differences reduced after 12 months of GFD but not significantly. Well-being in the CD group significantly improved after GFD but did not recover to control values. CD fecal microbiota showed a high abundance of proteolytic gene functions, associated with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, and Peptostreptococcus. GFD significantly reduced Bifidobacteria and increased Blautia wexlerae. Microbiome composition correlated positively with WGTT, colonic volume, and Akkermansia municphilia but negatively with B wexerelae. Following GFD, the reduction in WGTT and colonic volume was significantly associated with increased abundance of B wexlerae. There were also significant alterations in CAZyme profiles, specifically starch- and arabinoxylan-degrading families. CONCLUSIONS: CD impacted gut function and microbiota. GFD ameliorated but did not reverse these effects, significantly reducing Bifidobacteria associated with reduced intake of resistant starch and arabinoxylan from wheat.

Mainstay of treatment in celiac disease is total avoidance of gluten in diet whereas treatment in child with both the diseases will be Insulin therapy, exercise along with gluten free diet (GFD). There is dearth of literature regarding adherence to GFD and barriers for children with both T1DM and CD. METHODS: A questionnaire-based study was done at a tertiary care institute so as to compare the self-reported gluten adherence and the problems faced by children with dual diseases (TIDM and CD) and CD alone. Thirty children of age group 5-14 years each withType 1 DM and CD (T1DMCD group) and celiac disease (CD group) were selected consecutively. A questionnairewas filled by asking questions from either children (above 8 years) or parents (below 8 years) and the results were compiled, compared and further analysed. RESULTS: Baseline demographic parameters were comparable in both the groups. Gluten adherence was found to be worse in T1DMCD group as compared to CD group. Greater number of problems were experienced by children with both TIDM and CD as compared to children with CD alone (P < 0.05). Financial burden more so in T1DMCD group, unawareness about disease and benefits of GFD, less availability and social isolation were found to be the most significant barriers to diet adherence. CONCLUSION: As these children face dual diseases, they should be made more aware regarding benefits of GFD. Such information is valuable to primary care physicians for better management and rehabilitation of children suffering from these chronic diseases."

We compared baseline characteristics and serology normalization in children diagnosed with or without biopsies. A retrospective study of pediatric patients diagnosed with CeD during 2020: group A, no biopsy and group B, biopsy-based diagnosis. Baseline characteristics included demographics, anthropometrics, symptoms, family history, and celiac serology. Follow-up at 6-month intervals, up to 18 months, included dietary compliance, symptoms, and serology. Of 145 children diagnosed with CeD, 42 (29%) and 103 (71%) were from group A and B respectively. Mean age was 7.8 years (range 2.4-17.9 y), 91 (62.8%) females. Baseline symptoms or signs were present in 93 (64.1%) children, without significant difference between the groups. Baseline TTG levels were >  × 10 ULN in all patients in group A and 71 (68.9%) in group B. Among these patients, the rate of TTG decline during follow-up did not differ at any time point between patients diagnosed with and without biopsy, and between patients with and without symptoms. At the last follow-up visit, 24 (57%) children in group A and 46 (65%) in group B had TTG <  × 3 ULN without significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: Rate of TTG decline did not differ between CeD patients diagnosed with and without biopsy, suggesting that, at least in short term, no biopsy approach may not change patients' adherence and families' attitude towards treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Based on current guidelines, there is a rise in the incidence of pediatric celiac disease (CeD) diagnosis without an intestinal biopsy. • There is insufficient data regarding patients' adherence to treatment, including pattern of serology decline, based on the method of CeD diagnosis. WHAT IS NEW: • Children with CeD have similar baseline characteristics, including presence or absence of symptoms, whether diagnosed with or without biopsies. • During 18-month follow-up, the rate of celiac serology decline, and the reported adherence to treatment, do not differ between patients diagnosed based on biopsy or no biopsy approaches.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder exacerbated by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to intestinal inflammation and damage. This chronic disease affects approximately 1% of the world's population and is a growing health challenge due to its increasing prevalence. The development of CD is a complex interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental factors, especially gluten, culminating in a dysregulated immune response. The only effective treatment at present is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. However, adherence to this diet is challenging and often incomplete, so research into alternative therapies has intensified. Recent advances in understanding the molecular and immunological aspects of CD have spearheaded the development of novel pharmacologic strategies that should provide more effective and manageable treatment options. This review examines the latest innovations in CD therapies. The focus is on drugs in advanced clinical phases and targeting specific signaling pathways critical to the disease pathogenesis. We discuss both quantitative strategies such as enzymatic degradation of gluten, and qualitative approaches including immunomodulation and induction of gluten tolerance. Innovative treatments currently under investigation include transglutaminase inhibitors, which prevent the modification of gluten peptides, and nanoparticle-based therapies to recalibrate the immune response. These new therapies not only promise to improve patient outcomes but are also expected to improve quality of life by reducing the burden of dietary restrictions. The integration of these new therapies could revolutionize the treatment of CD and shift the paradigm from strict dietary restrictions to a more flexible and patient-friendly therapeutic approach. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the future prospects of CD treatment and emphasizes the importance of continued research and multidisciplinary collaboration to integrate these advances into standard clinical practice.",

One major challenge for these individuals is dining out, as they must constantly avoid cross-contact with gluten, contend with a limited range of restaurant options, and often encounter unknowledgeable or misinformed staff. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program designed to enhance the understanding of CD and gluten-free diet (GFD) among future catering staff, thereby improving the social experiences of individuals with CD. A 3-h theoretical and practical session was developed for professional cookery students, focusing on predefined competencies and learning outcomes related to GFD. The study involved a sample of 100 students from Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Following the intervention, students demonstrated increased knowledge regarding gluten content in foods and the application of GFD principles, including cross-contact prevention. However, during the practical activity, the gluten-free dish they prepared was not safe for CD patients to consume. Additionally, the students' perception of the difficulty in providing a GFD remained unchanged. Future sessions should emphasise the importance of interpreting food labels and practising cross-contact prevention. The strong interest in training hospitality students to promote social inclusion of CD patients highlights the need for more programmes to enhance their dining options and safety."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the primary treatment of celiac disease (CeD), a gluten-driven enteropathy. Concerns have been raised about increased exposure to arsenic from a GFD because rice, which naturally bioaccumulates arsenic, is commonly used as a substitute for gluten-containing grains such as wheat. We hypothesize that arsenic exposure increases in newly diagnosed children with CeD after they adopt a GFD. METHODS: This is a single-center prospective longitudinal cohort study of children (age 2-18 years) with elevated celiac serology who underwent a diagnostic endoscopy before initiation of a GFD between January and May 2022. The primary outcome was change in urinary arsenic concentration between endoscopy and after 6 months on a GFD. RESULTS: Of the 67 recruited participants, 50 had a biopsy diagnostic of CeD and were invited to continue the study. Thirty-five participants completed sample collection. Participants were from a middle-class, well-educated population that was predominantly White with presenting symptoms of abdominal pain (51%) and diarrhea (29%). After 6 months on a GFD, there was a significant increase in the median urinary arsenic concentration (3.3 µg/L vs 13.6 µg/L, P = 0.000004). In regression models, family history of CeD and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with having a higher urinary arsenic concentration after 6 months on a GFD. DISCUSSION: Children with newly diagnosed CeD have increased arsenic exposure shortly after transitioning to a GFD. While the arsenic levels were well below acutely toxic concentrations, the clinical impact of chronic exposure to mildly elevated arsenic levels is unknown.",

METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 50 adults with biopsy-confirmed CeD who completed validated surveys evaluating demographics, psychological factors, QOL, eating pathology, and food avoidance. RESULTS: Overall CDQOL scores were good (mean: 62.7 out of 100). However, 58.0% of the participants self-elected to avoid one or more additional foods without diagnosed allergies or intolerances. Those avoiding one or more other foods had lower QOL scores (57.4 (23.2) vs. 70.2 (15.9)) compared to those only avoiding gluten (p = 0.034). The mean depression score (CESD) for the group avoiding foods beyond gluten was in the depressive range, unlike those avoiding only gluten (16.0 (4.9) vs. 13.6 (4.0), p = 0.078), with 77% of those avoiding more than gluten scoring above the CESD cut-off point of 15, indicating clinical depression. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of participants (58%) reported avoiding additional foods beyond the GFD, a behavior associated with decreased QOL and increased depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Common gastrointestinal disease irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is marked by symptoms like changed bowel habits, bloating, and stomach ache. A low-FODMAP combined gluten-free diet (LF-GFD) has been suggested as a possible therapy for IBS symptoms management. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate whether a LF-GFD would help patients with IBS. METHODS: Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria from internet databases helped to identify clinical studies evaluating the intervention of LF-GFD in the treatment of IBS patients. Using measurements including the visual analog scale (VAS) for bloating and pain, the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), and IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL), the main results evaluated were the efficacy of LF-GFD in reducing IBS symptoms. Furthermore assessed were the psychological impacts of LF-GFD utilizing the self- rating depression scale (SDS) and self- rating anxiety scale (SAS). RESULTS: A total of 437 patients (221 on LF-GFD diet and 216 on GFD) were involved in 4 randomized controlled trials and 4 cohort studies. The combined results indicated that LF-GFD reduced the VAS bloating ratings (RR = - 0.58, 95%CI - 0.92-0.23, P = 0.0010, I2 = 83%) and the VAS pain scores (RR = - 0.42, 95%CI - 0.66-0.19, P = 0.005, I2 = 58%). In addition, LF-GFD indicated a substantial enhancement in IBS-SSS scores (MD = - 1.42, 95%CI - 2.74-0.10, P = 0.03, I2 = 24%) and IBS-QoL ratings (MD = 3.75, 95%CI 0.98-6.53, P = 0.008, I2 = 33%). Moreover, the LF-GFD group showed a substantial drop in SDS (MD = - 2.56, 95%CI - 3.38-1.74, P < 0.00001, I2 = 65%) and SAS (MD = - 4.30, 95%CI - 6.53-2.24, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%) scores compared to the GFD group. CONCLUSION: LF-GFD therapy significantly enhances clinical symptoms and reduces anxiety and depression in individuals diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.",

Due to fortification rules excluding gluten-free products in the United States of America (U.S.A.), understanding the nutritional adequacy of a GFD is important for promoting optimal health among those with CeD. Cross-sectional examination of multiple 24 h dietary recalls from a study sample of 50 adults and 30 teens with CeD was used to determine nutritional adequacy and excesses according to U.S.A. recommendations. The results were compared with those of 15,777 adults and 2296 teens from a nationally representative sample not reporting CeD, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2014. Compared with NHANES, our study population was more at risk of low folate and carbohydrate (adults) consumption, and of excessive niacin and vitamin A (teens), as well as saturated and total fat consumption (adults). Overall, though, compared with NHANES, our study participants had similar nutrient concerns but fewer nutritional imbalances, with some notable exceptions. In addition to maintaining a GFD, individuals with CeD should be counseled to maintain a balanced diet and to pay attention to nutrient-dense foods. Special attention should be given to teens in providing dietary counseling to potentially mitigate the risk of future morbidity.",

The cornerstone of treatment is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). This paper collected studies that were screened between the 15th and 25th of June 2024 and were searched for from many databases and registers, including PubMed, Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Europe PMC, and EBSCO Open Dissertations. We have included the 12 most relevant studies that examined the effects of GFD adherence among pediatric patients with celiac disease. Evidence suggests that a GFD caused notable improvements in liver function, growth metrics, and quality of life indices. Extraintestinal symptoms such as cardiac dysfunctions and obstructive sleep apnea also showed compelling improvement. We conclude that there are substantial advantages of a GFD in children with celiac disease and call for the need for personal nutritional support to address nutritional deficiencies and long-term studies and comprehensive strategies to optimize treatment outcomes and improve the quality of life for affected children."

Limited education about the disease and a GFD is an attributing factor to inadequate adherence. Thus, our aim was to assess the current knowledge about a GFD and the clinical monitoring of adherence to the diet among CeD people and HCPs. Specific questionnaires were designed and distributed to assess the knowledge of CeD people (Q1 questionnaire) (n = 2437) and to analyze the follow-up of the disease from the perspective of patients (Q2 questionnaire) (n = 1294) and HCPs (Q3 questionnaire) (n = 346). Two-thirds of HCPs specialized in pediatric care, while one-third did so in adult care. In CeD people, general questions regarding food classification and cross-contamination are well understood. When patients have doubts, 51.4% reported using the Internet and social networks. Thus, it is crucial that resources like social media are reliable and provide valuable information. Q3 revealed the lack of time to follow up the diet after diagnosis (48% of HCPs allocate < 15 min), the interest in further training, and the need for a professional specialized in diets within the healthcare system. In conclusion, it is essential to enhance nutritional education to increase awareness of a GFD.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to find the tool that best predicts celiac individuals' adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The Transparent Reporting of Multivariable Prediction Models for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD-SRMA) guideline was used for the construction and collection of data from eight scientific databases (PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, LIVIVO, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Proquest) on 16 November 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies involving individuals with celiac disease (CD) who were over 18 years old and on a GFD for at least six months, using a questionnaire to predict adherence to a GFD, and comparing it with laboratory tests (serological tests, gluten immunogenic peptide-GIP, or biopsy). Review articles, book chapters, and studies without sufficient data were excluded. The Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS) was used for data collection from the selected primary studies, and their risk of bias and quality was assessed using the Prediction Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). The association between the GFD adherence determined by the tool and laboratory test was assessed using the phi contingency coefficient. The studies included in this review used four different tools to evaluate GFD adherence: BIAGI score, Coeliac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT), self-report questions, and interviews. The comparison method most often used was biopsy (n = 19; 59.3%), followed by serology (n = 14; 43.7%) and gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) (n = 4; 12.5%). There were no significant differences between the interview, self-report, and BIAGI tools used to evaluate GFD adherence. These tools were better associated with GFD adherence than the CDAT. Considering their cost, application time, and prediction capacity, the self-report and BIAGI were the preferred tools for evaluating GFD adherence.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic disease characterized by the presence of endometriumlike tissue outside the uterus and is often associated with symptoms, such as dysmenorrhea, dysuria, dyschezia, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. Moreover, women diagnosed with endometriosis can report gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating, constipation or diarrhea, and abdominal cramping, which can be associated with irritable bowel syndrome and can result in the misdiagnosis of endometriosis as irritable bowel syndrome at first. Treatment usually involves hormonal therapy, pain management, surgery, and/or assisted reproductive techniques in case of infertility. Nonetheless, these treatment methods can be insufficient for alleviating symptoms or can have unacceptable side effects, leading to noncompliance. Therefore, women often apply self-management strategies, including dietary interventions. One of the diets frequently suggested as a tool to manage endometriosis-related symptoms on social media and patient forums is a gluten-free diet. Although a gluten-free diet has been proven effective in managing nonceliac wheat sensitivity or celiac disease, its effectiveness in endometriosis remains uncertain. The Nurses' Health Study II found it unlikely that gluten intake was a strong factor in endometriosis etiology and symptomatology. To the best of our knowledge, the most frequently cited and sole published intervention study on the efficacy of a gluten-free diet for endometriosis has several important limiting factors, including the absence of a control group. In addition, gluten consumption is highly susceptible to a placebo effect and a nocebo effect, where women might experience symptom relief after eliminating gluten and return of symptoms after they consume gluten again, solely because they believe that gluten is bad for them. Despite the inverse association between body mass index and endometriosis and between a gluten-free diet and increased body mass index, this is an association, and no causality was proven. In addition, other factors should be taken into consideration. Of note, a gluten-free diet is expensive, has limited availability, and has a significant effect on quality of life. Moreover, without proper dietary guidance, it may adversely affect the gastrointestinal microbiome. Therefore, scientifically substantiated advice regarding the use of a gluten-free diet for endometriosis-related symptoms is currently not available, and a gluten-free diet should be discouraged unless there is an additional diagnosis of nonceliac wheat sensitivity or celiac disease."

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing food by genetically predisposed individuals. Hence, treatment of CD consists of permanent avoidance of wheat, rye, barley, and other gluten-containing foods. Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves the symptoms of CD, but recent evidence suggests it is also associated with a higher risk for hepatic steatosis and the coexistence or emergence of other cardiometabolic risk factors. Moreover, a higher risk for liver steatosis is also reported by some authors as a potential extraintestinal complication of the CD itself. Recent nomenclature changes designate the association between hepatic steatosis and at least one of five cardiometabolic risk factors as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). An extended network of potentially causative factors underlying the association between MAFLD and CD, before and after dietary therapy is implemented, was recently described. The individualized treatment of these patients is less supported by evidence, with most of the current recommendations relying on empiric clinical judgment. This review focuses on the causative associations between CD and hepatic injury, either as an extraintestinal manifestation of CD or a side effect of GFD, also referring to potential therapeutic strategies for these individuals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, approximately 1.4% of people have celiac disease (CD), induced by gluten sensitivity. If left untreated, it causes small intestinal inflammation and villous atrophy, which can result in failure to thrive, anemia, osteoporosis, malabsorption, and even malignancy. The only treatment option available is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Few studies have looked at the role and perception of telehealth in relation to CD and selective nutrition both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: Our goal was to screen and investigate the research conducted both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic concerning the utilization of telehealth applications and solutions in CD and other GFD-dependent circumstances. METHODS: We employed a narrative review approach to explore articles that were published in scholarly journals or organizations between the years 2000 and 2024. Only English-language publications were included. PubMed and Google Scholar searches were mainly conducted using the following keywords: telemedicine, telehealth, telecare, eHealth, m-health, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, celiac disease, and gluten-free diet (GFD). Manual searches of the references in the acquired literature were also carried out, along with the authors' own personal contributions of their knowledge and proficiency in this field. RESULTS: Only a few studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 outbreak examined the viewpoints and experiences of adult patients with CD with relation to in-person clinic visits, as well as other options such as telehealth. The majority of patients believed that phone consultations were appropriate and beneficial. Video conferencing and telemedicine became more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the effectiveness of using these technologies for CD on a global basis. In recent years, urine assays for gluten identification have become accessible for use at home. These tests could be helpful for CD monitoring with telemedicine assistance. CONCLUSIONS: The extended knowledge gathered from the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to complement pre-COVID-19 data supporting the usefulness of telemedicine even after the emergent pandemic, encouraging its wider adoption in standard clinical practice. The monitoring and follow-up of CD patients and other GFD-dependent conditions can greatly benefit from telemedicine."

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on disease severity, quality of life, and inflammatory markers in patients with UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, we evaluated the effect of a GFD on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, disease severity, and quality of life in patients with mild to moderate UC. Patients' quality of life and severity of symptoms were evaluated using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI), respectively. Patients received this regimen for six weeks and were evaluated before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean age of patients (n = 26) was 39.31 years (standard deviation = 9.34). In both study groups, the mean ESR, CRP, IBDQ, and SCCAI showed no statistically significant improvement with the dietary intervention. Fecal calprotectin was increased in both groups without statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: We could not find any significant effect of GFD on inflammatory markers, quality of life, and disease severity among patients with mild to moderate UC. It is too early to suggest the gluten-free diet as a safe and beneficial regimen for UC patients. There is a need for further investigations with larger sample sizes and longer follow-ups as clinical trials and cohort studies to obtain more reliable results.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immuno-mediated enteropathy caused by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals carrying HLA (Human Leukocytes Antigen) genes that encode for DQ2.5 and DQ8 molecules. TRAFD1 (TRAF-type zinc finger domain 1) is a gene recently found associated with CD and defined as a master regulator of IFNγ signalling and of MHC class I antigen processing/presentation. There is no specific drug therapy and the only effective treatment is the gluten-free diet (GFD). The great majority of celiac patients when compliant with GFD have a complete remission of symptoms and recovery of gut mucosa architecture and function. Until now, very few studies have investigated molecular differences occurring in CD patients upon the GFD therapy. METHODS: We looked at the expression of both HLA DQ2.5 and TRAFD1 risk genes in adult patients with acute CD at the time of and in treated patients on GFD. Specifically, we measured by qPCR the HLA-DQ2.5 and TRAFD1 mRNAs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the two groups of patients. RESULTS: When we compared the HLA-DQ mRNA expression, we didn't find significant variation between the two groups of patients, thus indicating that GFD patients have the same capability to present gliadin antigens to cognate T cells as patients with active disease. Conversely, TRAFD1 was more expressed in PBMC from treated CD subjects. Notably, TRAFD1 transcripts significantly increased in the patients analyzed longitudinally during the GFD, indicating a role in the downregulation of gluten-induced inflammatory pathways. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that HLA-DQ2.5 and TRAFD1 molecules are two important mediators of anti-gluten immune response and inflammatory process."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) mechanisms are well described, but the aetiology is uncertain. Coeliac disease (CD), a gluten enteropathy with increased duodenal eosinophils overlaps with GORD. Functional dyspepsia is a condition where duodenal eosinophilia is featured, and a 6-fold increased risk of incident GORD has been observed. Perturbations of the duodenum can alter proximal gastric and oesophageal motor function. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the association between CD and GORD. METHODS: A systematic search of studies reporting the association of GORD and CD was conducted. CD was defined by combined serological and histological parameters. GORD was defined based on classical symptoms, oesophagitis (endoscopic or histologic) or abnormal 24-h pH monitoring; studies reporting oesophageal motility abnormalities linked with GORD were also included. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. FINDINGS: 31 papers were included. Individuals with CD on a gluten containing diet were 3 times more likely to have GORD than controls (OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 2.09-5.44), and over 10 times more likely when compared to those on a gluten free diet (GFD) (OR: 10.20, 95% CI: 6.49-16.04). Endoscopic oesophagitis was significantly associated with CD (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.22-11.06). One year of a GFD in CD and GORD was more efficacious in preventing GORD symptom relapse than treatment with 8 weeks of PPI in non-CD GORD patients (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.08-0.36). Paediatric CD patients were more likely to develop GORD (OR: 3.29, 95% CI: 1.46-7.43), compared to adult CD patients (OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.65-3.93). INTERPRETATION: CD is strongly associated with GORD but there was high heterogeneity. More convincingly, a GFD substantially improves GORD symptoms, suggesting a role for duodenal inflammation and dietary antigens in the aetiology of a subset with GORD. Ruling out CD in patients with GORD may be beneficial. FUNDING: The study was supported by an Investigator Grant from the NHMRC to Dr. Talley."

Current treatment consists of strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) which is considered safe and effective in the large majority of patients. However, since adherence to a GFD is difficult and has a negative impact on quality of life, an increasing interest in other treatment options has emerged. Moreover, in some individuals a GFD is not sufficiently effective, necessitating alternative treatments. METHODS: By performing a systematic search, we constructed a detailed narrative review. Only treatment options considered relevant and conducted in a phase I, II or III clinical trial were included. RESULTS: Based on the pathophysiology of CD, four major therapeutic approaches can be distinguished: firstly, by focusing on intraluminal gluten detoxification before absorption occurs, secondly, by modulating intestinal permeability and preventing paracellular uptake, thirdly, by enhancing immunological tolerance to gluten and finally, by regulating gluten auto-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant efforts, no treatment has yet completed a phase III clinical trial. Future studies will likely focus on the use of supplemental drugs in conjunction to a GFD, with ALV003 and ZED-1227 currently being the most promising therapeutic options.",

AIM: To examine the effects of orally administered Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase protease (AN-PEP) on inadvertent gluten exposure and symptom prevention in adult celiac disease (CeD) patients following their usual GFD. METHODS: This was an exploratory, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled CeD patients on a long-term GFD. After a 4-wk run-in period, patients were randomized to 4 wk of two AN-PEP capsules (GliadinX; AVI Research, LLC, United States) at each of three meals per day or placebo. Outcome endpoints were: (1) Average weekly stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) between the run-in and end of treatments and between AN-PEP and placebo; (2) celiac symptom index (CSI); (3) CeD-specific serology; and (4) quality of life. Stool samples were collected for GIP testing by ELISA every Tuesday and Friday during run-ins and treatments. RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized for the intention-to-treat analysis, and three were excluded from the per-protocol assessment. Overall, 628/640 (98.1%) stool samples were collected. GIP was undetectable (< 0.08 μg/g) in 65.6% of samples, and no differences between treatment arms were detected. Only 0.5% of samples had GIP concentrations sufficiently high (> 0.32 μg/g) to potentially cause mucosal damage. Median GIP concentration in the AN-PEP arm was 44.7% lower than in the run-in period. One-third of patients exhibiting GIP > 0.08 μg/g during run-in had lower or undetectable GIP after AN-PEP treatment. Compared with the run- in period, the proportion of symptomatic patients (CSI > 38) in the AN-PEP arm was significantly lower (P < 0.03). AN-PEP did not result in changes in specific serologies. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study conducted in a real-life setting revealed high adherence to the GFD. The AN-PEP treatment did not significantly reduce the overall GIP stool concentration. However, given the observation of a significantly lower prevalence of patients with severe symptoms in the AN-PEP arm, further clinical research is warranted.",

      "abstract": "A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders. Nevertheless, strict adherence to the GFD is often challenging due to concerns about social isolation, risk of gluten contaminations, high cost, poor quality and the taste of gluten-free products. Moreover, although the GFD is effective in achieving mucosal healing, it may lead to dietary imbalances due to nutrient deficiencies over a long period of time. To overcome these issues, several gluten-free wheat flours have been developed to create products that closely resemble their gluten-containing counterparts. Furthermore, given the critical importance of adhering to the GFD, it becomes essential to promote adherence and monitor possible voluntary or involuntary transgressions. Various methods, including clinical assessment, questionnaires, serology for celiac disease, duodenal biopsies and the detection of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIPs) are employed for this purpose, but none are considered entirely satisfactory. Since adherence to the GFD poses challenges, alternative therapies should be implemented in the coming years to improve treatment efficacy and the quality of life of patients with celiac disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore current knowledge of the GFD and investigate its future perspectives, focusing on technology advancements, follow-up strategies and insights into a rapidly changing future.",

Despite the social burden, high expenses, and challenges of following a GFD, 2 to 5 percent of patients do not demonstrate clinical or pathophysiological improvement. Therefore, we need novel and alternative therapeutic approaches for patients. Innovative approaches encompass a broad spectrum of strategies, including enzymatic degradation of gluten, inhibition of intestinal permeability, modulation of the immune response, inhibition of the transglutaminase 2 (TG2) enzyme, blocking antigen presentation by HLA-DQ2/8, and induction of tolerance. Hence, this review is focused on comprehensive therapeutic strategies ranging from dietary approaches to novel methods such as antigen-based immunotherapy, cell and gene therapy, and the usage of nanoparticles for CD treatment.",

However, complete dietary gluten avoidance is challenging and a substantial number of patients do not respond fully, clinically, or histologically, despite their best efforts. As celiac disease is common and its central pathophysiology is well elucidated, it has become attractive for drug development to address the limitations of dietary treatment. Most efforts address nonresponsive celiac disease, defined as continued symptoms and/or signs of disease activity despite a gluten-free diet, and the more severe forms of refractory celiac disease, types I and II. An increasing spectrum of therapeutic approaches target defined mechanisms in celiac disease pathogenesis and some have advanced to current phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. We discuss these approaches in terms of potential efficiency, practicability, safety, and need, as defined by patients, regulatory authorities, health care providers, and payors.",

CeD patients have HLA-restricted, gluten-specific T cells persisting in the blood and gut even after decades of GFD, which are reactivated and disease driving upon gluten exposure. Our aim was to examine the transition of activated gluten-specific T cells into a pool of persisting memory T cells concurrent with normalization of clinically relevant biomarkers during the first year of treatment. METHODS: We followed 17 CeD patients during their initial GFD year, leading to disease remission. We assessed activation and frequency of gluten-specific CD4+ blood and gut T cells with HLA-DQ2.5:gluten tetramers and flow cytometry, disease-specific serology, histology, and symptom scores. We assessed gluten-specific blood T cells within the first 3 weeks of GFD in 6 patients and serology in an additional 9 patients. RESULTS: Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells peaked in blood at day 14 while up-regulating Bcl-2 and down-regulating Ki-67 and then decreased in frequency within 10 weeks of GFD. CD38, ICOS, HLA-DR, and Ki-67 decreased in gluten-specific cells within 3 days. PD-1, CD39, and OX40 expression persisted even after 12 months. IgA-transglutaminase 2 decreased significantly within 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: GFD induces rapid changes in the phenotype and number of gluten-specific CD4+ blood T cells, including a peak of nonproliferating, nonapoptotic cells at day 14. Subsequent alterations in T-cell phenotype associate with the quiescent but chronic nature of treated CeD. The rapid changes affecting gluten-specific T cells and disease-specific antibodies offer opportunities for clinical trials aiming at developing nondietary treatments for patients with newly diagnosed CeD.",

Previous studies have investigated its effect on body mass index (BMI) in celiac disease (CD) patients but had contradictive conclusions. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of GFD on BMI in CD patients. STUDY: Systematically, we conducted literature research using Medline, Scopus, and Embase, and we identified 1565 potential studies/abstracts. Only studies of patients with CD under a GFD with recorded BMI before and after dietary intervention were included. Subgroup analyses based on study design and BMI categories were performed. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) for the number of patients in each BMI group according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definitions after GFD using fixed and random effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: The analysis included 10 studies and 38 sub-studies/data sets, which encompassed 2450 patients from 5 countries. We found nonsignificant odds for changing the BMI group (pooled OR 0.972, 95% CI: 0.858-1.101, P =0.65) after GFD. However, looking specifically at BMI subgroups, we found higher odds for BMI category change after GFD in underweight patients (OR 0.588, 95% CI: 0.479-0.723, P <0.001), and overweight patients,25<BMI<30, (OR 1.332, 95% CI: 1.167-1.521, P <0.001). No publication bias was demonstrated, and the amount of heterogeneity between studies was moderate ( I2 =54.13). CONCLUSION: Although crucial in patients with CD, GFD is associated with increased BMI in some CD patient populations. Accordingly, special considerations and follow-up should be maintained in overweight patients with CD after GFD.",

The guidelines suggest a 14-day gluten intake > 3 gr to get CeD diagnosis, although many subjects refuse this approach. Other evidence showed that the intake of 50 mg/day of gluten for 3 months could be useful for CeD diagnosis. AIMS: We performed a dietary study, administering a low dose of gluten in form of \"crackers\" (about 60-120 mg of gluten/day) for 3 months, to get a final diagnosis of CeD in subjects already on GFD. METHODS: We enrolled adult patients with a suspicion of CeD on self-prescribed GFD. All subjects performed the crackers challenge for 3 months. At the end, all patients were analysed for CeD serology and if positive underwent endoscopy/histology. Also, we recorded the grade of satisfaction for the gluten challenge and the onset of adverse events. RESULTS: We enrolled 120 patients. All patients concluded the challenge without relevant adverse events. Serological positivity was detected in 54 patients (45%). Histology showed atrophy in 87% and Marsh 1-2 grade in 13% of patients. Ninety-nine patients (83%) were satisfied by this challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The \"crackers challenge\" is a useful and safe diagnostic approach in people on self-administered GFD.",

      "abstract": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which thyroid cells are attacked through cell-and antibody-mediated immune processes. A gluten-free diet reduces antibody concentration and regulates thyroid autoimmunization. Mediterranean diet reduces oxidative stress. This study evaluates the short-term effects of Mediterranean, gluten-free, and Mediterranean gluten-free dietary patterns on thyroid function and autoantibody levels of patients. The 40 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis included in the study were randomly divided into four groups (defined as gluten-free, Mediterranean, Mediterranean gluten-free, and controls) for 12 weeks. Thyroid function tests, autoantibody levels, and food consumption were recorded at the beginning and end of the study. There was no statistically significant difference in TSH levels of the groups before the intervention, but a statistically significant difference was found afterward (p < 0.05). Free T3 hormone levels showed a statistically significant difference across the groups before and after the intervention (p < 0.05). Free T3 hormone levels increased significantly in all intervention groups after the intervention, with the highest increase in the Mediterranean group (p < 0.05). In the intervention groups, anti-TPO and anti-Tg levels decreased after the intervention; however, this difference was not significant across groups (p > 0.05). In addition, body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumference averages decreased significantly in all intervention groups compared with controls (p < 0.05). The study achieved an increase in Free T3 hormone levels in the intervention groups. The most marked difference was seen in the Mediterranean gluten-free diet model, which may be due to the anti-inflammatory effect of both Mediterranean and gluten-free diets and the loss of body weight as a result of the intervention."

However, there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines on the GFD dietary management of coeliac disease. This position paper, led by the Special Interest Group in coeliac disease of the European Society of Pediatric, Gastroenterology Hepatology, and Nutrition, supported by the Nutrition Committee and the Allied Health Professionals Committee, aims to present evidence-based recommendations on the GFD as well as how to support dietary adherence. METHODS: A wide literature search was performed using the MeSH Terms: \"diet, gluten free,\" \"gluten-free diet,\" \"diets, gluten-free,\" \"gluten free diet,\" and \"coeliac disease\" in Pubmed until November 8th, 2022. RESULTS: The manuscript provides an overview of the definition of the GFD, regulations as basis to define the term \"gluten-free,\" which foods are naturally gluten-free and gluten-containing. Moreover, it provides recommendations and educational tips and infographics on suitable food substitutes, the importance of reading food labels, risk of gluten cross-contact at home and in public settings, nutritional considerations as well as factors associated to dietary adherence based on available evidence, or otherwise clinical expertise. CONCLUSIONS: This position paper provides guidance and recommendations to support children with coeliac disease to safely adhere to a GFD.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, affecting around 1% of the global population. It is a multifactorial disease involving both genetics and environmental factors. Nowadays, the only available treatment for CeD is a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD), which can cause a significant burden for patients, since symptoms and mucosal injury can persist despite apparent compliance with a GFD. This could also lead to psychological consequences and affect the quality of life of these patients. Thankfully, recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of CeD and the availability of various targets have made it feasible to explore pharmaceutical treatments specific to CeD. Recently, the FDA has highlighted the unmet needs of adult patients on a GFD who experience ongoing symptoms attributed to CeD and also show persistent duodenal villous atrophy. This review will outline the limitations of a GFD, describe the targets of potential novel treatment of CeD and provide an overview of the primary clinical trials involving oral and injectable agents for a non-dietary treatment of CeD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While lifelong and strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential for the successful treatment of celiac disease (CeD), only 30-50% of patients are able to maintain a good adherence to GFD. We determined factors influencing the adherence to GFD at various ecological levels including intra-personal, inter-personal, organizational, community and system-based levels in adult patients with CeD. METHODS: A questionnaire to assess the adherence was developed and it was administered in the CeD clinic to patients with CeD on GFD for >1 year. Adherence to GFD was assessed in a subset of patients (n = 320) using Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT). RESULTS: Overall, 978 patients [median age: 29 years; females: 592] with CeD on GFD were recruited. They reported many barriers to adherence to GFD including intra-personal barriers such as lack of knowledge about GFD (19%), inadequate financial resources (27.2%) and lack of self-motivation/confidence (55.3%); inter-personal barriers such as intake of gluten-containing food upon forceful insistence of friends/family (23.4%); organizational barriers such as high cost (70.8%) and non-availability of GF-food products (48.6%); community-based barriers like consumption of gluten-containing food at religious occasions/festivals (11.1%) and social occasions (27.2%); and system-based barriers such as non-referral to dietitian for counseling (21.9%). As per CDAT, 204 (63.7%), 73(22.8%) and 43(13.4%) patients had good, average, and poor adherence to GFD, respectively. On multivariable analysis, occasional consumption of gluten, non-availability of GF-food while dining out and coercing by family and friends for consumption of GC-food were found to have highest odds for poor adherence to GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Non-referral to a dietitian for counseling, irregular follow-up visits, unavailability of flour mill, non-supportive family/friends, high cost and limited availability of GF-food are the most common barriers to adherence to GFD. There is a need to create infrastructure and develop strategies to overcome these diverse barriers at various levels of ecosystem and thereby facilitate better adherence to GFD.",

      "abstract": "Background: Thyroid autoimmunity is an immune response to thyroid antigens that causes varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The sole effective treatment for Celiac Disease (CD) is a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, the association between GFD and thyroid autoimmunity in patients with CD has not been confirmed. Methods: A comprehensive search of several databases, involving PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane databases, was conducted to identify studies that primarily addressed the effects of GFD on thyroid autoimmunity in CD subjects. The meta-analysis involved studies that compared the risk of ATPO and ATG antibody positivity in CD patients with GFD, the risk of developing AITD, and the risk of developing thyroid dysfunction. Fixed-effects models or random-effects models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: A total of 10 observational studies met the inclusion criteria and included 6423 subjects. The results indicated that GFD is positively associated with thyroid autoimmunity in the children subgroup of CD patients (OR = 1.61, 95%CI 1.06-2.43, P = 0.02). However, there was no significant difference in thyroid autoimmunity between the group adhering to GFD and the control group in the total CD population. Conclusion: The results seem to indicate that subjects with a more pronounced autoimmunity (such as to have an early onset of CD) appear to have a greater risk of thyroid autoimmunity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A subgroup of adults with celiac disease experience persistent gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, which vary between individuals and the cause(s) for which are often unclear. METHODS: The present observational study sought to elucidate patterns of persistent symptoms and the relationship between those patterns and gluten-free diet adherence, psychiatric symptoms, and various aspects of quality of life (QOL) in an online sample of adults with celiac disease. U.S. adults with self-reported, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease (N = 523; Mage = 40.3 years; 88% women; 93.5% White) voluntarily completed questionnaires as part of the iCureCeliac® research network: (a) Celiac Symptoms Index (CSI) for physical symptoms and subjective health; (b) Celiac Dietary Adherence Test for gluten-free diet adherence; (c) PROMIS-29, SF-36, and Celiac Disease Quality of Life Survey for psychiatric symptoms and QOL. Symptom profiles were derived using latent profile analysis and profile differences were examined using auxiliary analyses. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis of CSI items determined a four-profile solution fit best. Profiles were characterized by: (1) little to no symptoms and excellent subjective health (37% of sample); (2) infrequent symptoms and good subjective health (33%); (3) occasional symptoms and fair to poor subjective health (24%); (4) frequent to constant symptoms and fair to poor subjective health (6%). Profiles 2 and 3 reported moderate overall symptomology though Profile 2 reported relatively greater extraintestinal symptoms and Profile 3 reported relatively greater gastrointestinal symptoms, physical pain, and worse subjective health. Profiles differed on anxiety and depression symptoms, limitations due to physical and emotional health, social functioning, and sleep, but not clinical characteristics, gluten-free diet adherence, or QOL. Despite Profile 3's moderate symptom burden and low subjective health as reported on the CSI, Profile 3 reported the lowest psychiatric symptoms and highest quality of life on standardized measures. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with celiac disease reported variable patterns of persistent symptoms, symptom severity, and subjective health. Lack of profile differences in gluten-free diet adherence suggests that adjunctive dietary or medical assessment and intervention may be warranted. Lower persistent symptom burden did not necessarily translate to better mental health and QOL, suggesting that behavioral intervention may be helpful even for those with lower celiac symptom burden.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Fly-catching syndrome (FCS) is a rare condition typically characterized by episodes during which affected dogs bite or lick the air and jump for no apparent reason. Among veterinary literature, obsessive-compulsive disorders, focal epileptic seizures, and underlying gastrointestinal diseases were considered the most likely triggering causes. Recently, gluten-sensitive dyskinesia has been described in dogs, but it has never been reported to be associated to FCS. ANIMAL: A 6-year-old male French Bulldog. CLINICAL PRESENTATION, PROGRESSION, AND PROCEDURES: The dog was presented for a 2-month history of episodes characterized by sudden onset of jumping while trying to catch something in the air without impaired consciousness or autonomic signs. The episodes could be interrupted by the owner and lasted several minutes. The dog suffered from chronic gastrointestinal signs. The neurological examination was within normal limits except for the episodes suggestive of FCS during the consultation. The serological test for anti-gliadin immunoglobulin G (AG IgG) and anti-transglutaminase-2 immunoglobulin A (ATG-2 IgA) antibodies resulted above the reference range (3.092 and 0.929, respectively; normal range < 0.6). TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: An exclusively gluten-free diet was started. Complete resolution of the episodes was reported during a 3-month follow-up. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of FCS associated to positive AG IgG and ATG-2 IgA antibodies responsive to a gluten-free diet. The typical manifestation of the episodes and response to diet support the hypothesis that FCS may be associated to gastrointestinal disorders. However, more studies are needed in order to confirm this hypothesis.",

Strict adherence to this diet in children yields excellent results in terms of the clinical symptoms present at the time of diagnosis. Despite the constraints associated with following this diet, it remains the only hope for children with CD to have a better quality of life and life expectancy. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive cohort study was carried out on children diagnosed with CD in the pediatrics department of the Hassan II University Hospital in Fez, Morocco. The children were followed up for 18 months, during which time they were seen as outpatients at different frequencies depending on their clinical condition and degree of compliance with the diet. RESULTS: Only half of the diagnosed children continued to follow our structure. Compliance with the gluten-free diet varied from 58.7% (n = 84) of children who strictly followed the GFD to 3.5% (n = 5) of children who never followed the diet. Compliance was significantly correlated with the child's age, with adolescents being the least compliant (p = 0.03). Similarly, a correlation was observed between compliance with the diet and the disappearance of symptoms (p <0.01), the persistence of certain symptoms (p = 0.02), and the occurrence of complications (p = 0.01). The majority of children (87.3%) had their clinical symptoms resolved within a mean delay of 6.4±3.6 months, with a mode of three months. The speed of symptom resolution differed from one symptom to another but remained statistically correlated with the degree of GFD compliance (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Despite the excellent results of a GFD on clinical symptoms in children, the discrepancies observed between compliance and non-compliance call for close follow-up of children with CD to avoid complications and repercussions on the vital prognosis in adulthood."

      "abstract": "Gluten, as a term, causes unease among a vast majority of the population. The reason is the body's inability to process gluten, causing various pathological manifestations. While celiac disease is predominantly a gastrointestinal disease, it also has various extra-intestinal manifestations. Many children receive diagnoses of idiopathic neuropsychiatric symptoms such as epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), and peripheral neuropathy without ever finding the root cause. A majority of these cases may be associated with celiac disease if only their antibody titers and other appropriate investigations were conducted. The treatment of these manifestations may be eliminated or at least controllable with dietary modification to a gluten-free diet (GFD). In this paper, we will discuss the pathology of celiac disease and the impact of GFD on the neuropsychiatric aspects of this disease, which is of higher prevalence in the pediatric population. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in prominent databases, namely PubMed and Google Scholar, to include studies that provided individual-level data on the neuropathological manifestations and the impact of a GFD on extra-intestinal manifestations of celiac disease. The research protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) with the registration ID: CRD42023415100. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we included prospective studies, observational studies, and case reports on pediatric patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease, serologically positive celiac disease, celiac disease with neuropsychiatric manifestations, and studies reporting the impact of GFD. After a rigorous quality assessment to remove the risk of bias, we finally included 20 studies to be discussed.  In 6 (30%) studies, patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations had positive serology findings and a relatively higher grade of biopsy results. Seven studies discussed the positive impact of GFD. Five of these seven studies reported statistically significant results (p ≤ 0.001). Our study suggests that gluten plays a role in the severity of neuropsychiatric manifestations of celiac disease. Considering the results of our study, we can see that GFD does impact the prognosis of the disease. Neuropsychiatric findings without gastrointestinal manifestations are more common in the pediatric age group. We have clear evidence that several neurological conditions (neuropathy, ADHD, epilepsy, and RLS) have not only a significant association with gluten but can also potentially benefit from GFD. Thus, screening, with a combination of serological, biopsy, and imaging techniques, must be adapted into the guidelines for early detection and induction of GFD. Furthermore, studies should aim at introducing GFD in the pediatric population as a mode of primary prevention. In conclusion, our review underscores the importance of gluten while dealing with idiopathic neurological conditions in children and hopes to shed light on this commonly misdiagnosed and easily manageable disease."

The effectiveness of AOMs in this population has not been previously described. METHODS: In our retrospective cohort study, we matched 39 patients with treated CeD to 78 patients without CeD based on sex and AOM. We assessed the weight loss outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months after starting the AOM in both cohorts and analyzed if there was a differential response when comparing by type of AOM [injectable glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists vs. oral non-GLP-1 AOMs]. RESULTS: Both cohorts had similar baseline demographic and anthropometric characteristics. At 12 months, the CeD cohort had a nonsignificantly inferior total body weight loss percentage compared with the cohort without CeD (6.5% vs. 9.5%, P =0.13). The CeD cohort had a similar proportion of patients achieving a total body weight loss percentage of ≥5% than the cohort without CeD (72.7% vs. 72.1%, P =1.00). No significant difference was observed when comparing the weight loss outcomes of injectables (GLP-1 receptor agonists) to oral AOMs. The proportion of patients reporting side effects was similar for both groups, regardless of the type of AOM. CONCLUSION: Patients with CeD taking AOMs had similar weight loss outcomes to patients without CeD. Hence, AOMs can be a safe and effective therapy for weight management in patients with CeD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies are a hallmark for celiac disease (CD). In CD patients on gluten free diet (GFD) these antibodies are transient. Few studies are available comparing the tTG-IgA assay characteristics for monitoring response to GFD. Since discrepant results were reported in patients on GFD after switching tTG-IgA assays, we conducted a retrospective observational study to monitor GFD response using three different tTG-IgA assays. METHODS: Diagnostic samples from 44 adults and 17 children with CD were included. Of most patients two follow-up samples after introduction of GFD were available. In all samples tTG-IgA were assessed using one fluorochrome-enzyme immuno-assay (FEIA) and two chemiluminescence immuno-assays (CLIA) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP) as surrogate marker for intestinal epithelial damage was measured. RESULTS: Using CLIA assays, normalization of antibody levels was delayed compared to FEIA (p<0.001). Of all samples taken after at least 6 months on GFD with elevated i-FABP indicating intestinal epithelial damage, 40 % had positive tTG-IgA according to the FEIA, 85 and 90 % according to the two CLIA. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of tTG-IgA in patients on GFD depends on the assay used. Both CLIA appear to be more sensitive in detecting suboptimal treatment response in CD-indicated by elevated i-FABP - when applying the manufacturer's recommended cut-off for the diagnosis of CD.",

For this reason, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of a GFD on anthropometric indicators. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in databases from inception until July 12, 2022. We included all relevant articles that evaluate efficacy of a GFD on anthropometric indicators in patients with and without celiac disease (CD). Random-effects models were applied to combine the data. The main outcomes were then analyzed using weight mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs. FINDINGS: A total of 27 articles met the eligible criteria and were included. Pooled results from the random-effects model indicated that the GFD has no significant effect on any of the factors of anthropometry, including weight (WMD, 1.20 kg; 95% CI, -1.16 to 3.55 kg; P = 0.319), body mass index (WMD, 0.70 kg/m2; 95% CI, -0.45 to 1.84 kg/m2; P = 0.233), waist circumference (WMD, 0.92 cm; 95% CI, -1.34 to 3.17 cm; P = 0.497), and body fat (WMD, 1.02%; 95% CI, -0.38% to 2.42%; P = 0.153). The subgroup results indicated that after implementation of a GFD significant increased weight and body fat occurred in patients with compared with without CD. In addition, the effect of this diet on the increase of BMI and body fat in the intervention of more than 48 weeks was significantly higher. IMPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that a GFD can have a significant and beneficial effect on weight and body fat in patients with CD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) is critical to achieving symptom control and mucosal healing in celiac disease (CeD), but its assessment is difficult. OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) measurements over a 4-wk period with conventional tools commonly used to monitor compliance with a GFD. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with CeD attending the Small Bowel Section of the Buenos Aires Gastroenterology Hospital were invited to this observational study and were instructed to collect stool samples on Fridays for 4 consecutive weeks. Weekly mean stool GIP concentration was measured was estimated. GIP results were compared with a self-assessment scale of adherence, specific CeD serology, the celiac symptom index, and the assessment by an expert dietitian. RESULTS: Fifty-three CeD patients were enrolled and those with stool GIP ≥0.65 μg/g/wk (n = 13; 24.5%) had higher serum concentrations of IgA deamidated gliadin peptides (DGPs) antibodies [69 (29-109) compared with 14 (13-29); P = 0.0005] and IgA tissue transglutaminase [42 (14-200) compared with 10 (7-16); P = 0.02], higher proportion of cases with IgA DGP antibodies >20 AU/mL (84.6% compared with 33.3%; P = 0.002), and a higher self-estimated adherence score [5 (4-9) compared with 9 (7-10); P = 0.003]. GIP did not correlate with celiac symptom index scores (55.6% compared with 30.8%; P = 0.9). Expert dietitian assessment identified 69% [odds ratio (OR): 5.25; 95% CI: 1.1-27.2; P = 0.01] of nonadherent cases when high stool GIP. Logistic regression analysis determined that IgA DGP (adjusted OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11; P = 0.02) and males (adjusted OR: 28.3; 95% CI: 1.1-722.6; P = 0.04) were independently associated with excessive gluten exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly stool GIP identifies gluten exposure that is not always detected by commonly used GFD adherence assessment methods. The higher the concentration of stool GIP, the better the predictive value of serology and dietitian interviews. Stool GIP is a useful and practical test for GFD monitoring, particularly for risky gluten exposure in real-life scenarios.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a frequent complaint in patients with celiac disease. A gluten-free diet is the only established treatment for celiac disease, but how this diet influences fatigue is uncertain. We aimed to investigate fatigue prevalence, severity, and associated factors in patients with celiac disease, at diagnosis and at 1 year after commencing a gluten-free diet. METHODS: 78 patients with serologically and histologically verified celiac disease, 78 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Primary endpoints were Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (fVAS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and inverted Vitality subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36vs). Clinically relevant fatigue was defined as: FSS score ≥ 4, fVAS score ≥ 50 mm, or inverted SF-36vs score ≥ 65. Higher scores represented more fatigue. RESULTS: Fatigue was reduced after a 12-month gluten-free diet. Median scores changed from 3.8 (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.2 to 4.8) to 1.9 (IQR: 1.4 to 3.5) for FSS, from 44.5 (IQR: 18.8 to 66.0) to 15.5 (IQR: 7.8 to 43.3) for fVAS, and from 65 (IQR: 40 to 75) to 35 (IQR: 25 to 55) for inverted SF-36vs (p < 0.001 for all). Fatigue prevalence also declined after treatment. However, scores were significantly higher in patients compared to control subjects. Higher fatigue scores were associated with depression and pain, but not with signs of disease activity or nutritional deficiency. CONCLUSION: At diagnosis, patients with celiac disease frequently had severe fatigue. Fatigue declined after a gluten-free diet, but it remained higher than that observed in healthy subjects.

Previously, we showed that a gluten-free (GF) diet provided strictly in utero reduces the autoimmune diabetes incidence in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice compared to a gluten-containing standard (STD) diet. The current study was initiated to elucidate possible mechanisms behind the diabetes-alleviating effect of the same diet intervention. NOD mice received either a GF Altromin diet or a STD Altromin diet during pregnancy. Female offspring from both groups were fed a STD diet throughout life and their diabetes incidence was recorded for 200 days. The following parameters were measured in 13-week-old female offspring: insulitis degree, glucose and insulin tolerance, and plasma insulin autoantibody titer. The diet intervention showed no reduction in autoimmune diabetes incidence, insulitis degree, glucose nor insulin tolerance and plasma insulin autoantibody titer. In conclusion, this study could not replicate the previously observed diabetes alleviative effects of a maternal gluten-free diet in NOD mouse offspring and could therefore not further elucidate potential mechanisms.",

Fecal samples were collected before and after probiotics, or placebo administration and the changes in intestinal microbiota were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Probiotic administration improved the patients' clinical symptoms when compared to the placebo group. Fatigue score was significantly reduced by the intake of probiotic supplements (P = 0.02). Except for Staphylococcus spp., the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium cluster I, Enterobacteriaceae, and Firmicutes were higher in probiotics group.

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is included in the group of complex or multifactorial diseases, i.e., those caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Despite a growing understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, diagnosis is still often delayed and there are no effective biomarkers for early diagnosis. The only current treatment, a gluten-free diet (GFD), can alleviate symptoms and restore intestinal villi, but its cellular effects remain poorly understood. To gain a comprehensive understanding of CD's progression, it is crucial to advance knowledge across various scientific disciplines and explore what transpires after disease onset. Metabolomics studies hold particular significance in unravelling the complexities of multifactorial and multisystemic disorders, where environmental factors play a significant role in disease manifestation and progression. By analyzing metabolites, we can gain insights into the reasons behind CD's occurrence, as well as better comprehend the impact of treatment initiation on patients. In this review, we present a collection of articles that showcase the latest breakthroughs in the field of metabolomics in pediatric CD, with the aim of trying to identify CD biomarkers for both early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. These advancements shed light on the potential of metabolomic analysis in enhancing our understanding of the disease and improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. More studies need to be designed to cover metabolic profiles in subjects at risk of developing the disease, as well as those analyzing biomarkers for follow-up treatment with a GFD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have systematically analyzed information regarding chronic medical conditions and available treatments on social media. Celiac disease (CD) is an exemplar of the need to investigate web-based educational sources. CD is an autoimmune condition wherein the ingestion of gluten causes intestinal damage and, if left untreated by a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), can result in significant nutritional deficiencies leading to cancer, bone disease, and death. Adherence to the GFD can be difficult owing to cost and negative stigma, including misinformation about what gluten is and who should avoid it. Given the significant impact that negative stigma and common misunderstandings have on the treatment of CD, this condition was chosen to systematically investigate the scope and nature of sources and information distributed through social media. OBJECTIVE: To address concerns related to educational social media sources, this study explored trends on the social media platform Twitter about CD and the GFD to identify primary influencers and the type of information disseminated by these influencers. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data mining to collect tweets and users who used the hashtags #celiac and #glutenfree from an 8-month time frame. Tweets were then analyzed to describe who is disseminating information via this platform and the content, source, and frequency of such information. RESULTS: More content was posted for #glutenfree (1501.8 tweets per day) than for #celiac (69 tweets per day). A substantial proportion of the content was produced by a small percentage of contributors (ie, \"Superuser\"), who could be categorized as self-promotors (eg, bloggers, writers, authors; 13.9% of #glutenfree tweets and 22.7% of #celiac tweets), self-identified female family members (eg, mother; 4.3% of #glutenfree tweets and 8% of #celiac tweets), or commercial entities (eg, restaurants and bakeries). On the other hand, relatively few self-identified scientific, nonprofit, and medical provider users made substantial contributions on Twitter related to the GFD or CD (1% of #glutenfree tweets and 3.1% of #celiac tweets, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Most material on Twitter was provided by self-promoters, commercial entities, or self-identified female family members, which may not have been supported by current medical and scientific practices. Researchers and medical providers could potentially benefit from contributing more to this space to enhance the web-based resources for patients and families."

This study investigated the diet quality, nutrition imbalances and nutrition status among young children,adolescents and adults with CD who were referred to several hospitals in Lebanon. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 50 individuals (31.74 ± 15.64 years) with CD who follow a gluten free diet was conducted, using biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements, dietary and physical activity assessments. Results: Of the 50 participants, 38% and 16% were presenting low serum levels of iron and vitamin B12, respectively. The majority of participants were physically inactive and around 40% of them had low muscle mass. A weight loss of 10% to 30% indicating mild to moderate malnutrition was shown in 14% of individuals. The assessment of food-related behaviors shows that 80% of participants were reading nutrition labels and 96% of them were following gluten-free diets (GFD). Some barriers including family ignorance (6%), language of the nutrition labels (20%) and expensive GF products (78%) were limiting the adherence to GFD. The inadequacy of the daily energy intake along with insufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D were remarked among individuals with CD. However, protein and iron intake were exceeding the recommendations among all age groups, except in males aged 4-8 years and 19-30 years. Half the study participants were using dietary supplements where 38%, 10%, 46%, 18%, 16% and 4% used vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, folate and probiotics, respectively. Conclusion: GFD is the key treatment for CD. However, it is not without inadequacies and may cause certain deficiencies such as calcium and vitamin D leading to reduced bone density. This underlines the critical role of dietitians in education and maintenance of healthy GFD among individuals with CD.",

      "abstract": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment available for celiac disease (CD); hence, it is important to ensure correct adherence to the diet and adequate monitoring of the diet. The present study aims to assess the importance of an early follow-up of celiac patients after diagnosis of the disease, identify the role of stool gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) in the assessment of GFD adherence, and analyze possible nutritional imbalances or deficiencies in the GFD. This is a cross-sectional study carried out in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CD in a tertiary hospital in Spain. Of the 61 patients included, 14% had positive stool GIPS at 4 months after CD diagnosis, Among them, 88% had negative stool GIPS at 9 months after diagnosis, following dietary advice. We found nutritional deficiencies in the GFD, such as vitamin D (with only 27% of patients with adequate intakes), folate, calcium, magnesium, and fiber. Similarly, we found imbalances: excess protein and fat intakes and a high percentage of total daily energy intake came from ultra-processed foods (UPF). These findings emphasize the importance of early follow-up of children after diagnosis of CD. It is also crucial to identify patients with poor GFD compliance based on stool GIPS and analyze GFD nutritional imbalances and deficits. Our findings may contribute to the development of specific strategies for the early follow-up of patients with CD, including appropriate nutritional counselling.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease related to gluten consumption. To date, the only effective therapy that can reverse symptoms and prevent complications is the gluten-free diet (GFD), which is challenging to maintain and has potential health risks. Identifying foods that can help diversify the GFD and that best match the nutritional needs of people with CD may improve the health and quality of life of celiac patients. This review, conducted through a non-systematic search of the available literature, aims to gather the most recent research on nutritional issues in CD and GFD. Moreover, it highlights how sorghum characteristics could provide health benefits to CD patients that counteract the nutritional problems due to CD and the nutritional consequences of GFD acceptance. Sorghum contains a wide variety of bioactive compounds, such as flavones and tannins, that have shown anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical studies. They can also regulate blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol to reduce the effects of common chronic diseases such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Because it is gluten-free, its use in making foods for celiac patients is increasing, especially in the United States. In conclusion, sorghum is a fascinating grain with nutritional properties and health benefits for supplementing GFD. However, only one study confirms the short-term safety of sorghum inclusion in the GFD, and further long-term studies with a large sample are needed.",

      "abstract": "Celiac Disease (CD) continues to require a strict lifetime gluten-free diet (GFD) to maintain healthy status. Many studies have assessed the GFD nutritional adequacy in their cohorts, but an overall picture in adults and children would offer a lifetime vision to identify actionable areas of change. We aimed at assessing the nutrient intakes of adult and pediatric CD patients following a GFD diet and identifying potential areas of improvement. Systematic review was carried out across PubMed, Scopus and Scholar up to October 2022, including full-text studies that assessed the nutrient intakes of CD patients on GFD, in terms of macro- and/or micronutrients (absolute or percentage daily average). Random-effect meta-analysis and univariable meta-regression were applied to obtain pooled estimates for proportions and influencing variables on the outcome, respectively. Thirty-eight studies with a total of 2114 patients were included. Overall, the daily energy intake was 1995 (CI 1884-2106) Kcal with 47.8% (CI 45.7-49.8%) from carbohydrates, 15.5% (CI 14.8-16.2%) from proteins, and 35.8% (CI 34.5-37.0%) from fats. Of total fats, 13.2% (CI 12.4-14.0%) were saturated fats. Teenagers had the highest consumption of fats (94.9, CI 54.8-134.9 g/day), and adults presented insufficient dietary fiber intake (18.9 g, CI 16.5-21.4 g). Calcium, magnesium, and iron intakes were particularly insufficient in adolescence, whereas vitamin D was insufficient in all age groups. In conclusion, GFD may expose CD patients to high fat and low essential micronutrient intakes. Given GFD is a lifelong therapy, to prevent the occurrence of diseases (e.g. cardiovascular or bone disorders) dietary intakes need to be assessed on long-term follow-ups.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Minimal change disease in childhood can follow a frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent course in up to 40% of cases. Second-line immunosuppressive medications that are used to manage these patients are associated with significant adverse effects. There is a need for safer alternative treatments for difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, we conducted an open-label feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of a gluten-free diet as treatment for pediatric patients with difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome. As a second aim, we sought to determine if the plasma zonulin concentration can identify those who are more likely to respond to this intervention. METHODS: Seventeen patients were placed on a gluten-free diet for 6 months. A positive response was defined as a 50% reduction in the relapse rate compared to the preceding 6 months or the ability to discontinue 1 immunosuppressive drug. RESULTS: Five (29%) participants had a positive response to the dietary intervention. The gluten-free diet was well tolerated with no clinical or laboratory adverse events. Plasma zonulin concentration was elevated in patients who failed to benefit from the gluten-free diet. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: A gluten-free diet may be a useful adjunctive intervention for patients with difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome that can be implemented prior to resorting to second-line immunosuppressive therapy. Development of the plasma zonulin level as a biomarker to predict efficacy would facilitate rational use of a gluten-free diet in the management of nephrotic syndrome."

      "abstract": "Celiac disease is a rising disorder and is becoming frequently diagnosed in recent years. To date, the only available treatment is the gluten-free diet (GFD). The role of gluten on components of metabolic syndrome and on related inflammatory response is still unclear due to controversial results. In recent years, scientific focus on this topic has been growing up, in particular regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters and diabetes. In addition, studies on the remaining components showed discordant results, which was likely due to heterogeneous and large celiac disease populations and to the lack of prospective studies. Furthermore, knowledge about the role of the GFD on inflammatory cytokines and the relationship among vitamin D and celiac disease, metabolic syndrome (MS) and GFD is needed. In this narrative review, we provided evidence regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters, cholesterol, triglycerides, waist circumference, blood pressure and inflammatory cascade, also evaluating the role of vitamin D, trying to summarize whether this nutritional pattern may be a value-added for subjects with dysmetabolic conditions. Finally, due to the limited findings and very low-certainty evidence, predominantly based on observational studies, the real effects of a GFD on different components of MS, however, are unclear; nevertheless, an improvement in HDL levels has been reported, although data on glycemic levels are discordant.",

New molecular features detectable in stool may improve and facilitate noninvasive clinical management of CD. For this purpose, fecal small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and gut microbiome profiles were concomitantly explored in CD subjects in relation to strict (or not) GFD adherence over time. In this observational study, we performed small RNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing in stool from 63 treated CD (tCD) and 3 untreated subjects as well as 66 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. tCD included 51 individuals on strict GFD and with negative transglutaminase (TG) serology (tCD-TG-) and 12 symptomatic with not strict/short-time of GFD adherence and positive TG serology (tCD-TG+). Samples from additional 40 healthy adult individuals and a cohort of 19 untreated pediatric CD subjects and 19 sex/age matched controls were analyzed to further test the outcomes. Several miRNA and microbial profiles were altered in tCD subjects (adj. p < .05). Findings were validated in the external group of adult controls. In tCD-TG-, GFD duration correlated with five miRNA levels (p < .05): for miR-4533-3p and miR-2681-3p, the longer the diet adherence, the less the expression differed from controls. tCD-TG+ and untreated pediatric CD patients showed a similar miRNA dysregulation. Immune-response, trans-membrane transport and cell death pathways were enriched in targets of identified miRNAs. Bifidobacterium longum, Ruminococcus bicirculans, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae abundances shifted (adj. p < .05) with a progressive reduction of denitrification pathways with GFD length. Integrative analysis highlighted 121 miRNA-bacterial relationships (adj. p < .05). Specific molecular patterns in stool characterize CD subjects, reflecting either the long-term GFD effects or the gut inflammatory status, in case of a not strict/short-time adherence. Our findings suggest novel host-microbial interplays and could help the discovery of biomarkers for GFD monitoring over time.",

CeD, in addition to digestive disease, is a multisystem disorder. If untreated, it is potentially can be a dangerous disorder and lead to morbidity and even mortality. At present, the only treatment option is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), and all authors recommended this regimen. To the best of our knowledge, there are rare reports of the complete remission of disorder on GFD and reintroduction of a normal diet in affected patients. In this report, we describe five patients with CeD who developed complete remission of clinical symptoms, histopathological changes, and serology on a gluten-containing diet. All patients had CeD based on a positive tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG IgA) and typical histopathological changes in duodenal biopsy with the complete disappearance of symptoms on the GFD regimen. All patients followed GFD for a mean 4 (±0.54) years. In conclusion, this study has shown that some CeD patients diagnosed in adulthood can recover a normal mucosa after a long period of the gluten-containing diet without relapsing any clinical or biological symptoms of CeD."

This study aimed to determine how GFD duration affects the BMI of Iranian patients with CD. Methods: In this prospective study, 215 patients with CD, who were on a GFD, were categorized into three groups according to the duration of compliance to GFD: 1. patients with less than 6 months of diet, 2. Patients who had a diet for 6 months to 2 years, and 3. patients with more than 2 years of diet. The BMI changes were assessed before and after adherence to the GFD. Results: Most patients' weight remains in the same BMI category during different courses of GFD adherence. Patients who were underweight showed significant changes in their BMI following the diet in less than 6 months (P=0.033) and more than 2 years (P<0.001), and the number of weight gain cases increased over time. Conclusion: There is a need for careful, updated, and personalized nutrition management of patients with CD in different periods of the diet. Conducting similar studies with larger sample sizes in different regions can lead to providing expert dietary counseling for patients with CD."

Most patients with T1DM who develop CeD are either asymptomatic or have mild CeD-related gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, children affected by T1DM should undergo screening for asymptomatic CeD. The aim of this review is to highlight the influence of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on glycemic control, growth rate, microvascular complications, and quality of life in patients with T1DM and CeD. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central databases were searched. Reports reviewed were those published from 1969 to 2022 that focused on the interplay of T1DM and CeD and examined the effect of diet on glycemic control, growth rate, and quality of life. The most challenging aspect for a child with T1DM and CeD is that most GFD foods have a high glycemic index, while low glycemic index foods are recommended for T1DM. Interestingly, dietary therapy for CeD could improve the elevated HbA1c levels. Avoiding gluten added to a diabetic dietary regimen in T1DM patients might impose practical limitations and lead to important restrictions in the lifestyle of a young patient. Consequently, non-adherence to GFD in patients with T1DM and CeD is common. GFD in patients with T1DM and CeD seems to lower the incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, but this requires further investigation. It seems that adherence to GFD in young patients with T1DM and CeD leads to regular growth and a stable body mass index without any negative effect on HbA1c or insulin requirements. Furthermore, the lipid profile and quality of life seem to have improved with the introduction of GFD.",

      "abstract": "Without a doubt, a majority of diseases are food-pattern-related. However, one disease stands out as an increasingly more common autoimmune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Celiac disease (CD) is an old disease, with changing clinical patterns, affecting any age, including infancy and adolescence, and becoming more frequent among the elderly. The gluten-free diet (GFD) has been the sole provider of clinical, serological, and histological improvement for patients with CD for more than seven decades. Nowadays, complete avoidance of dietary gluten is rarely possible because of the wide availability of wheat and other processed foods that contain even more gluten, to the detriment of gluten-free products. Undeniably, there is a definite need for replacing the burdensome GFD. An add-on therapy that could control the dietary transgressions and inadvertent gluten consumption that can possibly lead to overt CD should be considered while on GFD. Nevertheless, future drugs should be able to provide patients some freedom to self-manage CD and increase food independence, while actively reducing exposure and mucosal damage and alleviating GI symptoms. Numerous clinical trials assessing different molecules have already been performed with favorable outcomes, and hopefully they will soon be available for patient use.",

Ingested food plays a key role in the pathophysiology of disorders of gut-brain interaction as up to 84% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) report food-triggered symptoms. Potential pathogenetic mechanisms of food-related symptoms in these patients are discussed, focusing on bloating and abdominal distension. These mechanisms provide the rationale for dietary treatment in patients with functional abdominal bloating and distension. The role of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) and gluten in functional abdominal bloating and distension is examined. Current literature evaluating the efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet and the gluten-free diet in abdominal bloating and distension is analyzed. Available evidence originates mainly from studies on patients with IBS, since clinical studies on selected cohorts of patients with only functional abdominal bloating and distension have been missing to date. Promising evidence on the potential efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet in functional abdominal bloating and distension is provided by the reduction of the bloating observed in patients with IBS. Regarding the gluten-free diet, there is insufficient evidence to recommend it to reduce bloating and abdominal distension. In conclusion, this review asserts the need for a close collaboration with experts in nutrition to optimize the management of these patients and reduce the risks associated with elimination diets."

Participants included children and adolescents with CD, aged 8 to 18 years, that had been diagnosed more than 6 months prior to the study. Parents completed a demographic questionnaire and reported their child's constancy in adherence to the diet. Children and adolescents were asked to share the things they do themselves to prepare for participating in the various activities. Responses were qualitatively analyzed, and common themes were identified and categorized using directed analysis. Participants were 126 children and adolescents (Mage = 12.33 yr, SD = 2.85), 67.5% of whom had been diagnosed more than 3 yr prior to the study. Based on parents' reports, almost all (97.6%) participants \"always adhered\" to the diet. A total of 10 categories were defined from the qualitative responses describing 125 do and don't actions used by the children and adolescents to self-manage their diet. The do and don't actions encompass cognitive planning far beyond the mere act of avoiding gluten. These actions can serve as an initial database of suggested strategies to support acquiring independent self-management. Understanding the cognitive complexity of routinely carrying out the diet while actively participating in everyday activities can assist health professionals in building support and intervention programs, promoting effective self-management, and facilitating optimal adherence to the diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gluten-free diet is the treatment of celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders and excludes wheat, rye, and barley, while oats inclusion/exclusion has long been a matter of debate. A logo or catchphrase indicating the gluten-free condition in a product is all the consumer relies on to accept the product as suitable for his/her treatment. The oat-based gluten-free products represents a small market, which may have changed, and become more limited during COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess gluten contamination in all labeled oat-based gluten-free local and imported products available in the market, comparing them to matched regular gluten containing counterparts. As a secondary objective, unconventional flours available in the same sale points were also assessed. RESULTS: The search yielded 25 gluten-free labeled oat flours, rolled, and instant cereals, which were compared to 27 regular gluten containing equivalents. Gluten content was above the local (5 ppm) and the Codex Alimentarius cutoff (20 ppm) in 40 and 36% of the gluten-free labeled products, respectively. When all positive products were analyzed together, there were no differences in gluten content between labeled and unlabeled products. Locally produced products were more expensive, while rolled/instant oats were less contaminated than flours (p = 0.01). Precautionary labels advising presence of gluten as allergen was omitted in 37.0% of regular products. Only 33.3% of unconventional flours obtained from open markets and sold in bulk, were gluten contaminated. CONCLUSION: Oat-based gluten-free products are currently highly contaminated. It is urgent to regulate them and implement protocols that allow safe consumption of these products."

      "abstract": "Currently, the only treatment for coeliac disease (CD) is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD); however, their completeness with regard to energy and macro- and micronutrients remains poorly understood. Paediatric studies are often limited by a low quality and a lack of controls, and their findings should be interpreted with caution. The aim of the present study was to evaluate nutritional imbalances in children with CD on a strict GFD. Methods: A single-centre prospective cohort study was conducted. A total of 48 children with CD (33 girls, mean age 11.8 ± 3.68 years) on a strict GFD (mean duration 5.02 ± 3.87 years) were compared with 50 non-coeliac subjects (26 girls, mean age 10.2 ± 3.97 years). In both groups, anthropometric measurements (body height, weight and BMI) and laboratory tests (haemoglobin level, calcium and magnesium serum concentration, folic acid, vitamin B1, B2, B6 and B12 level) were checked. Additionally, in coeliac subjects, a 3-day food record for energy and macro- and micronutrient intake assessment were determined, and the values were compared to those in non-CD participants and the dietary reference intake (DRI) standards. Results: The CD children were more likely to demonstrate significantly lower serum vitamin B1 and folic acid levels compared to controls (p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). Although mean serum calcium values were within normal ranges, they were significantly lower in CD subjects than controls (p = 0.01). Mean calcium, folic acid and vitamin D intake was below the dietary recommendations in the CD group (69.9%, 71.2% and 68.9% DRI, respectively) but did not differ significantly between CD and non-coeliac subjects. In turn, the mean supply of proteins and carbohydrates in the CD group substantially exceeded the recommended levels (190.3% and 189.4% DRI, respectively) but was similar to controls. A significantly higher number of CD children were classified as underweight, and a significantly lower number as overweight or obese, compared with controls (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Although children with CD receive nutritional education at diagnosis, a GFD often does not provide a balanced set of macro- and micronutrients. This is mainly due to unhealthy dietary habits, as commonly observed in the general population. Children with CD should be informed that while their diet should be free of gluten, it should nevertheless cover all their nutrition requirements in the long term.",

The aim of the present study was to assess whether the gluten-free diet determines the effect of vitamin D treatment on thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid function in young women with autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis. The study compared two groups of euthyroid premenopausal women with this disorder, matched for thyroid antibody titers: 31 women with non-celiac gluten sensitivity complying for at least 12 months with the gluten-free diet and 31 unaffected sisters of women with non-celiac gluten sensitivity remaining without any dietary intervention. Plasma titers of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, as well as plasma concentrations of thyrotropin, free thyroid hormones, prolactin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and high-sensitive C-reactive protein were measured at entry and after a six-month follow-up. Moreover, at both time points, the structure parameters of thyroid homeostasis were assessed. Although exogenous vitamin D decreased titers of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies and increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in each treatment group, this effect was less pronounced in patients on the gluten-free diet than in patients not following any dietary recommendations. Only in the latter group of patients, vitamin D increased SPINA-GT. Treatment-induced changes in thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies correlated with the impact of treatment on 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. The obtained results suggest that gluten-free diet may impair beneficial effects of exogenous vitamin D in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",

The present aim was to assess whether GFD was associated with changes in the gut bacteriome composition and in its functional capacity, and whether such changes mediated the observed effects of GFD on beta cell function. METHODS: Forty-five children (aged 10.2 ± 3.3 years) were recruited into a self-selected intervention trial primarily focused on determining the role of GFD on beta cell preservation ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02867436). Stool samples were collected prior to the dietary intervention and then at 3-month intervals. A total of 128 samples from the GFD group and 112 from the control group were analysed for bacteriome 16S rDNA community profiles, the bacteriome functional capacity was predicted using PICRUSt2 and actual gut metabolome profiles measured using NMR. Intestinal permeability was assessed using serum zonulin concentrations at 1, 6 and 12 months and lactulose/mannitol tests at the end of intervention. Dietary questionnaires were used to ensure that the dietary intervention did not result in differences in energy or nutrient intake. RESULTS: The bacteriome community composition changed during the intervention with GFD: of abundant genera, a 3.3-fold decrease was noted for Bifidobacterium genus (adjusted p=1.4 × 10-4 in a DESeq2 model, p=0.026 in generalised estimating equations model), whereas a 2.4-fold increase was observed in Roseburia (adjusted p=0.02 in DESeq2 model, p=0.002 in generalised estimating equations model). The within-sample (alpha) diversity did not change, and there was no statistically significant clustering of GFD samples in the ordination graphs of beta diversity. Neither of the genera changes upon GFD intervention showed any association with the pace of beta cell loss (p>0.50), but of the remaining taxa, several genera of Bacteroidaceae family yielded suggestive signals. The faecal metabolome profile ordination correlated with that of bacteriomes but did not associate with GFD or categories of beta cell preservation. There was no indication of changes in gut permeability. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The bacteriome reacted to GFD, but the changes were unrelated to the pace of beta cell capacity loss. The previously observed moderately protective effect of GFD is therefore mediated through other pathways.",

AIMS: To assess the effects of gluten-free versus gluten-containing diet on symptoms and the gut microenvironment, and to identify predictors of response to the gluten-free diet in IBS METHODS: Twenty patients with IBS and 18 healthy controls (HC) followed a gluten-free diet during two 14-day intervention periods where they sprinkled either gluten (14 g/day) or rice flour powder over their meals. Primary outcomes included effects of the interventions on IBS symptoms (IBS-SSS) and bowel habits. Secondary outcomes included effects of gluten-free diet on faecal microbiota and metabolite profile. RESULTS: IBS symptoms improved during the gluten-free (p = 0.02), but not the gluten-containing period, with no difference between the interventions. IBS patients reported fewer loose stools during the gluten-free intervention (p = 0.01). Patients with IBS and HC presented distinct metabolite profiles based on the effects of the gluten-free diet (p < 0.001). True responders (reduced IBS-SSS by ≥50 solely after gluten-free period) and non-responders were discriminated based on the effects of the gluten-free diet on the microbiota (p < 0.01) and metabolite profiles (p < 0.001). The response to the gluten-free diet could be predicted by the metabolite profile before the intervention (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A gluten-free diet may influence symptoms in a subset of patients with IBS, with a particular effect on bowel habits. A gluten-free diet seems to impact the gut microenvironment. Responsiveness to the gluten-free diet may be predicted by the metabolite profile. CLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT03869359.",

Nutritional deficiencies are common in CD; however, how this is influenced by the presence of symptoms, duration of CD, and compliance of GFD is less clear. The objective of this study was to compare nutritional deficiencies in patients with CD to those of nonceliac populations on a GFD. The secondary outcomes were to compare deficiencies in short- (&lt;2 y) versus long-term (≥2 y) GFD, and in those with persistent symptoms versus asymptomatic. METHODS: We included patients seen at the McMaster Celiac Clinic from June 2018 to August 2020. GFD adherence was assessed with the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test, and CD serology, vitamins, and trace minerals were measured in blood samples. We enrolled 221 patients, including 182 patients with CD and 39 controls. RESULTS: Overall, 103 of 182 patients with CD (56.6%) were following a GFD for &gt;2 y and 119 patients (69.2%) were symptomatic. The most common micronutrient deficiencies were zinc (48.3%), ferritin (16.9%), and vitamin D (33.3%). There were no differences in micronutrient deficiencies between patients with CD and nonceliac controls, short- and long-term GFDs, or those strictly compliant with GFD and those who were fairly compliant (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nutrient deficiencies may be related more to GFD nutritional inadequacy rather than malabsorption.",

      "abstract": "This cross-sectional study aims to assess eating competence (EC—an intra-individual approach to food, behaviors, and attitudes related to food) and aspects related to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in Brazilian adults with gluten-related disorders (GRDs). The research was conducted using an online survey with a self-reported instrument consisting of 40 items, organized into three parts: (I) Socioeconomic and demographic data; (II) the Brazilian version of the Eating Competence Satter Inventory (ec-SI2.0™BR); and (III) questions about adherence and difficulties in following the gluten-free diet. EC was measured by the ecSI2.0™BR instrument, with scores ≥32 were considered competent eaters. The instrument was applied nationwide through the GoogleForms® platform from 14 February 2022 to 30 March 2022. The publicity for the recruitment was supported by Brazilian celiac local and national associations (Acelbras and Fenacelbra), pages of food services or personal pages of tips and posts about gluten-related disorders, and specialized stores that offer gluten-free foods. The recruitment occurred through social networks (emails, Facebook groups, WhatsApp, and Instagram). A total of 1030 Brazilians with GRDs answered the questionnaire. Most participants were female, aged 40 years or older, with an income >R$3000, and a high education level. The main difficulty regarding adherence to GFD was the high cost of gluten-free foods. Individuals younger than 40 years old had lower EC scores, with no differences between men and women. Increasing socioeconomic status, schooling, and culinary practices increased the total score. Participants who “never/almost never” felt socially judged because their diet had higher scores for total EC. Competent eaters GRD individuals (EC ≥ 32) were mostly individuals aged ≥40 y/o; with income > R$3000; following a GFD; satisfied with purchased gluten-free products; consuming gluten-free products prepared at home, mainly by themselves; who do not feel judged because of the GRD and who feel that they can live a normal life with GRD. Our study showed that individuals who strictly adhere to the GFD have higher scores on eating competence than those who sometimes follow the treatment.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten from wheat and other cereals. Nowadays, its positive diagnosis is based on invasive approaches such as the histological examination of intestinal biopsies and positive serology screening of antibodies. After proven diagnosis, the only admissible treatment for CD individuals is strict life-long adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD), although it is not a conclusive therapy. Acting by different mechanisms and with different etiologies, both CD and GFD have a great impact on gut microbiota that result in a different taxa composition. Altered production of specific metabolites reflects these microbiota changes. In this light, the currently available literature reports some suggestions about the possible use of specific metabolites, detected by meta-omics analyses, as potential biomarkers for a CD non-invasive diagnosis. To highlight insights about metabolomics application in CD study, we conducted a narrative dissertation of selected original articles published in the last decade. By applying a systematic search, it clearly emerged how the metabolomic signature appears to be contradictory, as well as poorly investigated."

Our aims were to determine adherence to the gluten-free diet and the risk factors for non-adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted. It included individuals of both sexes and of any age that presented with celiac disease, lived in Paraguay from January to April 2021, and agreed to participate in the survey. Incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Non-probabilistic convenience sampling was utilized. Adherence was measured using the Leffler questionnaire. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidad Privada del Este. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 371 respondents, 322 (87%) of whom were adults, with a mean age of 38 ± 12 years, and 49 (13%) of whom were children and adolescents, with a mean age of 10 ± 5 years. Female sex was predominant (85%). Adherence to the gluten-free diet was detected in 59% of the adults and 73% of the children and adolescents. The factors significantly associated with adherence included belonging to the child and adolescent age group and having had the diagnosis for a longer time: 9 ± 8 years for the adherence group and 7 ± 8 years for the non-adherence group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the frequency of adherence to the gluten-free diet in celiac patients in Paraguay. Psychologic and nutritional support is recommended for individuals with celiac disease that do not adhere to their treatment.",

The systematic search followed databases such as PUBMED (MEDLINE), SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE and EMBASE. Out of 843 initially screened papers, a total number of 13 research papers were included. A total of 212 patients with CD on GFD, in comparison to 174 healthy individuals and 176 untreated patients with CD, were examined. Analysis of the microbial community based primarily on faecal samples and duodenal biopsies. Bifidobacterium was noticed to be less abundant in the study group than in both control groups, while the abundance of Bacteroides was more numerous in the group of CD patients on GFD. Staphylococcaceae prevailed in untreated CD patients. Despite the fact that the GFD was not able to fully restore commensal microorganism abundance, the treatment was associated with the greater abundance of selected beneficial bacteria and lower presence of pathogenic bacteria associated with worsening of CD symptoms.",

The only therapy for CD patients is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Gluten-free food contamination by other cereals during packaging and cooking or accidental ingestion of gluten may cause several intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms in CD patients. Therefore, the monitoring of gluten contamination in food and assessing the level of ingested gluten by analytical biomarkers has been of great interest in recent years. To this aim, small gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) obtained by the hydrolysis of gluten and present in urine and feces have been studied as biomarkers of gluten intake and to monitor adherence to GFD by CD patients. More recently, the use of circulating, fecal and urinary miRNAs has emerged as a novel diagnostic tool that can be potentially applied to assess adherence to GFD. Moreover, the presence of GIPs and miRNAs in both feces and urine suggests a similar excretion modality and the possibility of using urinary miRNAs, similarly to GIPs, as potential biomarkers of GFD in CD patients."

The few studies in this regard do not confirm positive changes resulting from a gluten-free diet. At the same time, the presence of other comorbid autoimmune diseases in this group of patients is increasing. This may have important implications for the interpretation of test results and the need for a gluten-free diet in some patients. In this review, the PubMed database was searched for links between a gluten-free diet, Hashimoto's disease, and autoimmune diseases. When analyzing the available literature, we found no basis for introducing a gluten-free diet for the standard management of Hashimoto patients. The recommended diet is instead an anti-inflammatory diet that levels the supply (to compensate for deficiencies) of vitamin D, iodine, and selenium, which are found in plant products rich in polyphenols, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids, as illustrated in this article.",

METHODS: A prospective interventional study on newly diagnosed celiac patients was conducted in the Pediatrics department of a tertiary care teaching institute in 2 stages viz. on presentation and after 6 months of GFD. Anthropometric measurements, biochemical investigations, Vitamin D levels, and DEXA scan was done at recruitment and after 6 months of GFD and was analyzed. RESULTS: In newly diagnosed 60 pediatric celiac patients, positive effect of GFD on anthropometry, hemoglobin, Vitamin D levels, DEXA scan parameters was observed. Significant difference was found in Vitamin D levels which increased from baseline 14.85 ± 5.39 to 18.22 ± 5.67 ng/ml after 6 months of GFD (P < 0.05). Significant difference was found in BMD (mean Z-score) which increased from -0.941 ± 0.738 to -0.640 ± 0.60 after 6 months of GFD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that there is significant increase in vitamin D levels as well as Z-score, bone mass density (BMD) and bone Mass Content (BMC) after 6 months of GFD."

Τhe aim of the present study was to gain an insight into patients' perceptions regarding the GFD, in relation to difficulties experienced, disease-specific symptoms, adherence level, and information sources used. METHODS: Two hundred ninety CD patients (247 women and 43 men) aged 18-74 years, completed a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Self-rated dietary adherence was high in 65.5%, moderate in 27.5% and poor in 6.9% of the patients. The main difficulties encountered were the high cost and limited availability of GF foods and meals in markets and restaurants. The main source of information concerning CD and GFD was the internet, and the most useful source was the Coeliac Society. Dietary adherence correlated positively with Coeliac Society membership and awareness of the monthly CD allowance. CONCLUSION: Α substantial proportion of patients did not adhere to a strict GFD. Patients were not adequately followed-up. INNOVATION: A self-administered questionnaire was used to explore the practical challenges of a GFD in an understudied population, Greek adult coeliac patients. The results highlighted the need for dietitians with expertise on CD."

Currently, the only available treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Screening for CD is primarily performed using serum based testing for anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies. Patients must be on a gluten containing diet at the time of testing to ensure an accurate serological result. We investigated the prevalence of a GFD in hospital clinic settings and the general population using survey data to estimate the proportion of CD patients that may be misdiagnosed for CD based on serological tests. Data were collected at clinics of a metropolitan hospital in Sydney, Australia, and the general population. Data from Medicare Benefits Scheme and tTG results from a large Australian private laboratory were reviewed for comparison. Of 778 participants who responded to the survey, 58 (7.5%) were on a GFD. More patients attending the immunology (15.9%) and gastroenterology (12.1%) clinics adopted a GFD than those attending the diabetes (2.6%) or endocrinology (6.1%) clinics, or in the general population (4.3%). More females than males excluded gluten from their diet (p<0.0001). Medicare statistics between 2013 and 2019 demonstrated an increase in CD serological testing; however, tTG data from a private pathology highlighted a stable level of elevated tTG antibodies of 3% of total tests performed. The high number of individuals on a GFD is likely impacting the ability to accurately diagnose CD using serum-based testing.",

This study investigated the alteration in sleep disturbances within 6 months of starting a GFD in children with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 103 children initially diagnosed with CD, with no psychiatric diagnosis and not receiving psychotropic medication, were included in this study. Sociodemographic data were collected, and the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) was completed both before and after six months of initiating a GFD. RESULTS: Overall, the total average CSHQ score was 46; after starting the GFD, this decreased to 40, which was under the clinically significant cutoff level for sleep disturbance (p < 0.001). A total of 74 patients (71.8%) had a CSHQ score above the clinically significant cutoff before treatment, which decreased to 40 patients (38.8%) six months after GFD (p < 0.001). A significant improvement was detected in all CSHQ subscale scores and in the total CSHQ score after starting the GFD (p < 0.001). Parasomnia and the total CSHQ score were higher in children who were diagnosed incidentally compared to symptomatic children but did not differ after GFD (p < 0.005). In 39 patients (37.8%), the total CSHQ score remained high 6 months after starting the GFD. Maternal and paternal ages were significantly higher in children whose scores remained high (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A significant improvement in sleep scores was detected after starting a GFD, regardless of initial age, sex, and symptom status. With a GFD, children may fall asleep more easily and sleep for longer with less interruptions. GFD may help to reduce sleep disturbances in CD, but future studies should investigate the certain conditions in patients who do not respond to a GFD."

We performed a randomized trial comparing traditional dietary advice (TDA) against the low FODMAP diet (LFD) and gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Patients with Rome IV-defined non-constipated IBS were randomized to TDA, LFD, or GFD (the latter allowing for minute gluten cross-contamination). The primary end point was clinical response after 4 weeks of dietary intervention, as defined by ≥50-point reduction in IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS). Secondary end points included (1) changes in individual IBS-SSS items within clinical responders, (2) acceptability and food-related quality of life with dietary therapy, (3) changes in nutritional intake, (4) alterations in stool dysbiosis index, and (5) baseline factors associated with clinical response. RESULTS: The primary end point of ≥50-point reduction in IBS-SSS was met by 42% (n = 14/33) undertaking TDA, 55% (n = 18/33) for LFD, and 58% (n = 19/33) for GFD (P = .43). Responders had similar improvements in IBS-SSS items regardless of their allocated diet. Individuals found TDA cheaper (P < .01), less time-consuming to shop (P < .01), and easier to follow when eating out (P = .03) than the GFD and LFD. TDA was also easier to incorporate into daily life than the LFD (P = .02). Overall reductions in micronutrient and macronutrient intake did not significantly differ across the diets. However, the LFD group had the greatest reduction in total FODMAP content (27.7 g/day before intervention to 7.6 g/day at week 4) compared with the GFD (27.4 g/day to 22.4 g/day) and TDA (24.9 g/day to 15.2 g/day) (P < .01). Alterations in stool dysbiosis index were similar across the diets, with 22%-29% showing reduced dysbiosis, 35%-39% no change, and 35%-40% increased dysbiosis (P = .99). Baseline clinical characteristics and stool dysbiosis index did not predict response to dietary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: TDA, LFD, and GFD are effective approaches in non-constipated IBS, but TDA is the most patient-friendly in terms of cost and convenience. We recommend TDA as the first-choice dietary therapy in non-constipated IBS, with LFD and GFD reserved according to specific patient preferences and specialist dietetic input.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated small bowel enteropathy resulting from dietary gluten exposure. Presently, the only effective treatment is adoption of a gluten-free diet (GFD), although strict adherence is challenging to maintain, and inadvertent gluten exposures are inevitable for most patients. Hence, there is substantial interest in drug development in CeD and multiple novel therapies are under investigation. AIMS: To review existing and upcoming clinical trial programmes for pharmacologic agents for CeD. METHODS: A narrative review was performed, informed by a search of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane CENTRAL Library and clinicaltrials.gov. RESULTS: We summarise the pathophysiology of CeD and the specific steps that are potentially amenable to pharmacologic treatment. We evaluate the evidence supporting existing and future drug targets, including trials of peptidases, gluten sequestrants, tight junction regulators, anti-transglutaminase 2 therapies, immune tolerizing agents, advanced biologics and small molecules, and microbiome-targeted strategies. We highlight unique considerations for conducting CeD trials, including identifying appropriate study populations, assessing results in the context of a gluten challenge, and interpreting CeD-specific clinical and histologic outcomes. Understanding these factors is crucial for accurately appraising the evidence. Finally, we outline what the future of CeD therapy may hold with the introduction of pharmacotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for pharmacologic options for CeD, either used adjunctively with a GFD for accidental or intentional gluten exposures or for refractory disease. Multiple promising agents are in development, and these trials are likely to lead to approvals for the first generation of pharmacologic agents for CeD within the next 5 years.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a major cause of disability and the leading cause of death worldwide. To reduce mortality and morbidity, prevention strategies such as following an optimal diet are crucial. In recent years, low-gluten and gluten-free diets have gained strong popularity in the general population. However, study results on the benefits of a gluten-reduced or gluten-free diet are conflicting, and it is unclear whether a gluten-reduced diet has an effect on the primary prevention of CVD. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of a gluten-reduced or gluten-free diet for the primary prevention of CVD in the general population. SEARCH METHODS: We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science up to June 2021 without language restrictions or restrictions regarding publication status. Additionally, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and checked reference lists of included studies as well as relevant systematic reviews for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), such as prospective cohort studies, comparing a low-gluten or gluten-free diet or providing advice to decrease gluten consumption with no intervention, diet as usual, or a reference gluten-intake category. The population of interest comprised adults from the general population, including those at increased risk for CVD (primary prevention). We excluded cluster-RCTs, case-control studies, studies focusing on participants with a previous myocardial infarction and/or stroke, participants who have undergone a revascularisation procedure as well as participants with angina or angiographically-defined coronary heart disease, with a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease or with type 1 diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of studies in a two-step procedure following Cochrane methods. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) and the 'Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions' (ROBINS-I) tool, and the certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: One RCT and three NRSIs (with an observational design reporting data on four cohorts: Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), Nurses' Health Study (NHS-I), NHS-II, UK Biobank) met the inclusion criteria. The RCT was conducted in Italy (60 participants, mean age 41 ± 12.1 years), two NRSIs (three cohorts, HPFS, NHS-I, NHS II) were conducted across the USA (269,282 health professionals aged 24 to 75 years) and one NRSI (Biobank cohort) was conducted across the UK (159,265 participants aged 49 to 62 years). Two NRSIs reported that the lowest gluten intake ranged between 0.0 g/day and 3.4 g/day and the highest gluten intake between 6.2 g/day and 38.4 g/day. The NRSI reporting data from the UK Biobank referred to a median gluten intake of 8.5 g/day with an interquartile range from 5.1 g/day to 12.4 g/day without providing low- and high-intake categories. Cardiovascular mortality From a total of 269,282 participants, 3364 (1.3%) died due to cardiovascular events during 26 years of follow-up. Low-certainty evidence may show no association between gluten intake and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for low- versus high-gluten intake 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.06; 2 NRSIs (3 cohorts)). All-cause mortality From a total of 159,265 participants, 6259 (3.9%) died during 11.1 years of follow-up. Very low-certainty evidence suggested that it is unclear whether gluten intake is associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted HR for low vs high gluten intake 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.01; 1 NRSI (1 cohort)). Myocardial infarction  From a total of 110,017 participants, 4243 (3.9%) participants developed non-fatal myocardial infarction within 26 years. Low-certainty evidence suggested that gluten intake may not be associated with the development of non-fatal myocardial infarction (adjusted HR for low versus high gluten intake 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.10; 1 NRSI (2 cohorts)). Lowering gluten intake by 5 g/day also showed no association on the primary prevention of non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction (composite endpoint) in linear dose-response meta-analyses (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.06; 1 NRSI (2 cohorts)). Coronary risk factors  Type 2 diabetes From a total of 202,114 participants, 15,947 (8.0%) developed type 2 diabetes after a follow-up between 22 and 28 years. There was low-certainty evidence that a lower compared with a higher gluten intake may be associated with a slightly increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes (adjusted HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22; 1 NRSI (3 cohorts)). Furthermore, lowering gluten intake by 5 g/day may be associated with a slightly increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes in linear dose-response meta-analyses (adjusted HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.16; 1 NRSI (3 cohorts)). Blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein level, body mass index (BMI) After six months of follow-up, very low-certainty evidence suggested that it is unclear whether gluten intake affects systolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -6.9, 95% CI -17.1 to 3.3 mmHg). There was also no difference between the interventions for diastolic blood pressure (MD -0.8, 95% CI -5.9 to 4.3 mmHg), low-density lipoprotein levels (MD -0.1, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.3 mmol/L) and BMI (MD -0.1, 95% CI -3.3 to 3.1 kg/m²).  No study reported data on adverse events or on other outcomes. Funding sources did not appear to have distorted the results in any of the studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Very low-certainty evidence suggested that it is unclear whether gluten intake is associated with all-cause mortality. Our findings also indicate that low-certainty evidence may show little or no association between gluten intake and cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction. Low-certainty evidence suggested that a lower compared with a higher gluten intake may be associated with a slightly increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes - a major cardiovascular risk factor. For other cardiovascular risk factors it is unclear whether there is a difference between a gluten-free and normal diet. Given the limited findings from this review predominantly based on observational studies, no recommendations for practice can be made.",

      "abstract": "Association between celiac disease (CD) and infertility has been a point of consideration for many years. There are lots of studies which present contradictory results. It is accepted that women with unexplained infertility have three times higher risk of CD compared to the healthy women. This finding leads to the conclusion that a gluten-free diet (GFD), as the only effective method of treatment CD, is important to improve fertility. It is observed that women diagnosed with CD and treated by GFD, have positive pregnancy outcomes including better effects of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Excluding gluten from diet by women without CD diagnosis could bring adverse outcomes, because the risk of malnutrition if diet is unbalanced. On the other hand, some research show that not only GFD but CD is related to malnutrition which could be the cause of problems with getting pregnant or with termination of pregnancy. Regarding CD influence on women's reproductive system, it is not only connected with unexplained infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, but also with delayed menarche, early menopause and decrease of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). What is more, non-celiac wheat sensitivity affects the reproductive system by increasing risk of menstrual disorders too. The main aim of this paper is presenting scientific facts about the link between gluten elimination and fertility. It is very important to provide patients with reliable fact-checked information in the context of their symptoms.",
