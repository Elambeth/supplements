      "abstract": "Background: Non-specific low back pain is a discomfort that affects individuals at any point in their lives. This study's aim was to determine the effects of myofascial release and joint mobilization on muscle thickness via ultrasonography in individuals experiencing non-specific low back pain. Methods: This double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted on 84 participants in three groups: joint mobilization, myofascial release, and a combination of joint mobilization and myofascial release. Data were collected during a two-week treatment regimen (days 1, 4, 8, and 12) and at a one-month follow-up. Ultrasound evaluations were used to measure the thickness of deep lumbar muscles at rest and contraction, i.e., the transverse abdominis (rTrA and cTrA) and lumbar multifidus (rLM and cLM). Repeated-measures ANOVA was utilized to analyze the follow-ups within the groups and among the groups, with post hoc tests conducted to identify specific differences. Results: Significant increases in muscle thickness were observed over time in the transverse abdominis, with improvements in both rTrA (right, p = 0.001; left, p = 0.001) and cTrA (right, p = 0.001; left, p = 0.008). The lumbar multifidus also demonstrated significant changes, with increases in the rLM (right, p = 0.001; left, p = 0.047) and cLM (right, p = 0.004; left, p = 0.037). However, the main effects showed no significant differences in muscle thickness among the groups. Conclusions: Joint mobilization demonstrated increased effectiveness in improving muscle thickness relative to myofascial release and a combination of both treatments for individuals with non-specific low back pain."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Trigger points can disrupt muscle activity patterns and cause cramping, fatigue, and weakening. Massage guns and myofascial release are widely employed for such circumstances, but their isolated outcomes are unknown. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a massage gun versus myofascial release technique on subjective pain, pain pressure threshold and ankle ROM for 12 weeks in people with pain and latent trigger points in the calf muscles. METHODS: From December 2024 to November 2025, this assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial will enroll 60 patients with latent myofascial trigger points in the calf and equally (1:1) allocate them randomly to either massage gun (Group A) or myofascial release technique (Group B) at the Outpatient Service Unit, Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Jashore University of Science and Technology (JUST), Jashore, Bangladesh. Both groups will receive 12 sessions of massage gun or myofascial release on latent trigger points, with 20 min of ice once a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes are subjective pain severity by the visual analog scale and pain sensitivity by pressure algometry, while the secondary outcome is ankle dorsiflexion range of motion by an inclinometer to be measured at the baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment. The ethical approval and trial registration obtained prospectively, we will adhere to the International committee on harmonization good clinical practice (ICH-GCP) by confirming confidentiality, respect, voluntary participation and withdrawal rights of participants and justice. To ensure trial safety, the manageable and fatal adverse effects will be recorded and reported. RESULTS: Sociodemographic, clinical, and outcome characteristics will be collected at baseline after randomization. A non-experimental assessor will evaluate group treatments afterward. A data monitoring committee-appointed expert data analyst will compare and analyze the independent assessors' baseline and post-treatment outcome values. DISCUSSION: This study will address the research gap on isolated outcomes of newly addressed widely used massage guns and conventional myofascial release techniques on reducing subjective pain, and pressure pain threshold and improving ankle ROM for patients with pain and latent trigger points at the calf muscle. This single-centre study will indicate short-term outcomes with poor external generalization, but the study will help the clinicians in evidence-based practice and guide future multicenter studies with long term evaluations with a follow-up design.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative condition, afflicting large number of people globally. Fascia is a three-dimensional network of connective tissue that helps in force transmission along the myofascial chains to bone level causing malalignments and movement dysfunctions. Myofascial dysfunctions have been identified in osteoarthritis of knee as a pain-causing component. Recently, clinicians have aimed a variety of therapeutic techniques at fascia. There is a lack of literature to determine the effect of kinetic chain activation technique (K-CAT) as well as deep front line (DFL) release technique in OA knee. PURPOSE: The current study aimed to determine and compare the effectiveness of DFL release and K-CAT in knee OA. METHODS: The study was a randomized clinical trial conducted in an outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital. Thirty-two (n = 32) participants between 45 and 60 years of age with knee osteoarthritis (grades 2 and 3) were included and randomized into two groups based on selection criteria. Group A received DFL myofascial release and Group B received K-CAT, along with common conventional therapy (modality + exercises), three sessions per week for 2 weeks. Pain intensity using Numeric Pain Rating Scale, skyline view of knee radiographic parameters including lateral patellar tilt angle (LPTA) and bisect offset (BO), dynamic knee valgus (DKV) by single leg squat using Kinovea software and quality of life using Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score on day 1 and day 14 of intervention were assessed. RESULTS: Within-group analyses showed significant improvements in both the groups for pain, BO on x-ray, DKV, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (p < 0.05). LPTA showed statistical significance only in the DFL group. However, between-group comparisons showed no statistical difference in all the outcomes (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both DFL myofascial release and K-CAT were found to be equally effective in alleviating pain, improving quality of life and knee malalignments.Trial registered under Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2023/11/059388)."

METHODS: In this prospective case series study, 30 patients with breast cancer diagnosed with AWS post-surgery were recruited. Participants underwent a 12-week intervention combining Gua Sha and myofascial release techniques. Upper limb function (primary outcome) was assessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]), range of motion (goniometry) and quality of life. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in upper limb function, with mean DASH scores decreasing from 52.3 ± 15.7 at baseline to 28.6 ± 12.4 at 12 weeks (p < 0.001). Pain intensity showed a marked reduction, with mean VAS scores decreasing from 6.8 ± 1.5 to 3.2 ± 1.8 (p < 0.001). Range of motion improved across all measured joints, with shoulder abduction showing the most substantial gain (mean increase: 35.2° ± 12.8°, p < 0.001). Quality of life scores also demonstrated significant enhancement, particularly in physical functioning and pain domains. CONCLUSION: The combined approach of Gua Sha and myofascial release techniques shows promising results in improving upper limb function, reducing pain and enhancing the quality of life in patients with breast cancer and AWS. These findings warrant further investigation through randomised controlled trials to establish the efficacy of this intervention compared with standard care.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Many healthcare professions incorporate foam rolling (FR) and static stretching (SS) to improve tissue extensibility. Currently, it is unknown if the order an individual performs FR and SS influences flexibility or whether flexibility is retained. This study aimed to determine if FR before, or, following SS influences passive hip flexion range of motion (ROM), and if changes are retained. DESIGN: Between-group experimental design. METHODS: Thirty-five participants with less than 90° of passive hip flexion ROM volunteered. Over 8 days, 6 days separated by 24 hours, and then 1 week (day 7) and 2 weeks (day 8) following the last treatment, ROM was measured before and following 1 of 5 treatments; FR/SS, SS/FR, SS, FR, or nothing (control). Participants laid supine on a table where a bubble inclinometer was placed on the tibia of the dominant leg with the hip passively flexed to establish pretreatment ROM. Participants then received the treatments. Passive hip flexion ROM was assessed from pretreatment on day 1 to posttreatment on day 6, day 7 (1 wk), and day 8 (2 wk). RESULTS: Passive hip flexion ROM increased for those receiving FR/SS, SS/FR, FR, and SS. ROM with FR and SS/FR was retained at day 7 but not day 8. Hip flexion ROM for FR/SS and SS were not retained at day 7 nor 8. SS/FR resulted in greater ROM than FR on day 6. SS/FR, FR/SS, SS, and FR were greater than the control at day 6. SS/FR was also greater than the control on days 7 and 8. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that FR the hamstring muscles after SS produces the greatest gains in passive hip flexion and would be appropriate in noninjured patients with less than 90°."

The aim of this study was to examine the distant effects of myofascial release applied to the thoracolumbar fascia together with exercise training on balance, lower-extremity flexibility, and muscular endurance in healthy young adults. DESIGN: Single-blinded randomized control trial design. METHODS: Thirty-six healthy participants aged 18-35 years were randomly divided into 3 groups: myofascial release and exercise group (group 1, n = 12), exercise group (group 2, n = 12), and control group (group 3, n = 12). Three days a week for 4 weeks, group 1 applied the thoracolumbar fascia foam roller massage together with the warm-up, muscular endurance, balance, and stretching exercise program, and group 2 applied the same exercise program except for the foam roller massage. No intervention was made in group 3. Flexibility was assessed with sit and reach test, muscular endurance with the 1-minute sit to stand test, and balance with star excursion balance test before the intervention and at the end of the fourth week. RESULTS: Flexibility, muscular endurance, and dynamic balance values increased significantly in groups 1 and 2 after the intervention (P < .05). When the difference values (Δ) of groups 1 and 2 were compared, there was a difference in favor of group 1 for flexibility, muscular endurance, and dynamic balance (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study showed that the effect of the distant myofascial release technique added to the exercise training on flexibility, muscular endurance, and dynamic balance was greater than the exercise training alone."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myofascial release (MFR) is a form of massage therapy that involves identifying and releasing restrictions in the fascia and muscles. MFR-like techniques have shown improvement in abdominal pain, distention, constipation, and quality of life (QoL) in adults. Therefore, MFR may be helpful in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder of gut-brain interaction or functional gastrointestinal disorder, mainly presenting with prolonged abdominal pain, bloating, and altered defecation patterns, leading to impairment in QoL. Treatments for IBS are limited and do not always completely relieve pain. To date, no studies have evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of MFR for children with IBS as a potential therapy. PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of administering abdominal wall-targeted MFR in children with IBS. SETTING: This study was approved and conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PARTICIPANTS: Males and females aged 13-18 years meeting Rome IV criteria for IBS were included in the study. RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants underwent six 1-h weekly sessions of abdominal wall-targeted MFR with a licensed massage therapist (LMT) and performed self-MFR at home between sessions. Feasibility and acceptability data were collected via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) by the study team and LMTs. Symptoms and QoL were assessed before and after the intervention period using child and parent versions of validated pediatric questionnaires. RESULTS: Of 10 participants aged 14-18 years, 60% females underwent the MFR intervention and completed the 6-week protocol. The median visit compliance with questionnaire completion was 90%. All participants received self-MFR education and performed self-MFR between sessions. Fascia restrictions were identified and released in all participants, as reported by the LMTs. Most participants voluntarily provided positive feedback on MFR. All participants reported no or minimal soreness during or after MFR, and no adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal wall-targeted MFR is feasible to administer and well accepted in pediatric IBS patients."

It was aimed to determine the acute effect of MFR technique on pain and flexibility in CLBP. METHODS: Forty CLBP patients (19 female; 21 male) with an average age of 40 years were randomized as MFR technique and classical massage groups. A single session of technique was applied to each group. Outcome measurements consisted of the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Sit and Reach Test (SRT), Straight Leg Raise Test (SLRT), and Modified Schober Test. RESULTS: In within-group comparisons, all outcome measures (except right-SLRT) improved statistically significantly in both groups after interventions (p˂0.05). ANCOVA was conducted to determine whether there were significant differences in between groups after intervention while controlling for age. The analysis showed that VAS, SRT and left-SLRT results were significantly more improved after the MFR technique compared with classical massage (p˂0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the MFR technique is a safe and effective method for the immediate relief of pain and the enhancement of flexibility. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior efficacy in pain relief and flexibility improvement compared to classical massage, which is another manual therapy technique.",

      "abstract": "Hypomobility in the foot structure causes functional limitations. These functional limitations affect sportive performance negatively, especially in basketball, where dynamic movements such as jumping and sudden changes in direction are very intense. In this context, reducing hypomobility is important in terms of eliminating performance disorders caused by hypomobility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of myofascial release on foot mobility and sportive performance in basketball players with hypomobile feet. This study was designed as randomized controlled experimental research. Twenty-four male basketball players (23.46 ± 2.81 years) participated in this study. The athletes were first subjected to foot mobility, balance and vertical jump tests. Then, the participants were divided into two groups: myofascial release (MR) and placebo myofascial release (PMR). Myofascial release (Graston technique) was applied to the MR group, and placebo myofascial release was applied to the PMR group. After application, foot mobility and performance measurements were performed again, and the results were analyzed. It was observed that there was a significant difference in right foot mobility (d = 4), left foot mobility (d = 6), vertical jump (d = 1.13) and dynamic balance (d = 1.03) parameters after application in the MR group. It was also determined that the acute effects of the intervention on foot mobility lasted for at least two hours (p < 0.001). There was no change in any parameter after application in the PMR group (p > 0.05). The results of this study show that a single session of myofascial release applied to the plantar sole temporarily increased foot mobility and improved vertical jump and dynamic balance performance in basketball players with chronic hypomobility."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coactivation between tonic and phasic muscles is essential for correct posture and movement. Impaired movement patterns and postural changes facilitate the flexor response to protect painful tissue in the injured area. Tone changes between tonic and phasic muscles lead to an imbalance in the rotator cuff (RC) muscles. DESIGN: A randomized controlled pilot study. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of applying myofascial release (MFR) to the muscles in the cervicothoracic region for the treatment of fascia limitations in patients with postoperative RC tear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. The patients in the control group performed exercises, whereas those in the MFR group performed exercises in addition to MFR. Pain intensity, grip strength, pectoralis minor flexibility, Constant Murley Score (CMS), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) score were evaluated. Pain intensity was recorded before and after the MFR sessions. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups regarding pain, grip strength, pectoralis minor flexibility, CMS values, or SF-36 score (p > 0.05). There were significant differences in pain levels measured before and after all MFR sessions. Moreover, a significant decrease is shown between the first and last sessions in the MFR group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MFR can be useful, especially in postoperative RC patients who have pain in the early period. Significant reductions in pain intensity after MFR can help prepare patients for exercise and reduce pain-related medication use.",

Elucidating the best prevention and treatment strategies for MPS has been one of the main goals in the last decade. The objective of the present study was to compare the acute effects of self-myofascial foam rolling release (SFR) and dry-needling (DN) techniques on ankle dorsiflexion ROM, soreness post-needling and performance through countermovement jump (CMJ) height. METHODS: a prospective crossover design composed by 12 active adults, aged 23.41 ± 1.68 years (weight: 78.33 ± 9.02 Kg; height: 1.79 ± 0.088 m) with active ankle dorsiflexion restriction was performed. Participants were randomized into the SFR and DN techniques to analyze its effects on ankle dorsiflexion ROM, muscle soreness and jump height at pre, post and 24 h post-intervention. RESULTS: significant improvements were found by DN on ankle dorsiflexion at 24 h post intervention and muscle soreness by SFR at the same time point. No significant differences were found between conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Both SFR and DN are effective in improving ankle dorsiflexion and performance in young adults without producing an acute effect in muscle soreness.",

METHODS: Shear wave speed values were measured in the regions of interest within the lateral gastrocnemius fascia and muscle areas from the elastographic images. Measurements were taken in three different situations: before, immediately after and 5 min after MFR protocol. Subsequently, the results from each situation were statistically compared. RESULTS: The protocol was administered to a group of eighteen tennis players with a mean age of 18 ± 1.23 years. The shear wave speed values increased for both fascia and muscles sites, after applying the MFR technique: From 3.01 ± 0.64 to 3.33 ± 0.86 m/s in the deep fascia and from 2.23 ± 0.41 to 2.57 ± 0.51 m/s in superficial fascia. In the deep and superficial muscles sites the increases were from 4.12 ± 0.95 to 4.40 ± 1.22 m/s, and from 2.94 ± 0.71 to 3.38 ± 0.95 m/s, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study showed that after the myofascial manipulation in tennis athletes, the lateral gastrocnemius muscle and fascia tissues stiffness increased, according to elastography, and possible mechanisms were discussed. ShearWave™ Elastography could be utilized to assess the acute effects of applying a direct myofascial release (MFR) technique.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ankle is one of the most commonly injured areas in people with active and sedentary lives. Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is characterized by pain and stiffness that limits daily living work. Myofascial release and eccentric training are believed to improve soft tissue circulation, strength, pain, ROM, and function. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of myofascial release with and without eccentric resistance on pain, range of motion, and functional disability in patients with AT. METHODOLOGY: This randomized clinical trial was conducted with a sample of 72 participants selected via a convenient sampling technique. Participants were divided into two groups, Group A was given myofascial release therapy, and Group B was given myofascial release with eccentric resistance. Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Goniometer, and Foot ankle disability index (FADI) were outcome measure tools for pain, range of motion, and functional disability. The assessment was done at baseline, 2nd and 4th week. Mann-Whitney U Test and Friedman's ANOVA were applied to find between-group and within-group differences. P-value was set at ≤0.05. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in pain (p = 0.03), plantarflexion ROM (p = 0.008), and functional disability (p = 0.02) between the two groups. However, no significant difference was observed in dorsiflexion (p = 0.06). Within-group differences were also significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that myofascial release with eccentric resistance was more effective than myofascial release without eccentric resistance in improving pain, range of motion, and functional disability in Achilles tendinopathy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate whether adding diaphragmatic release to corrective exercise could improve the Cobb angle and pulmonary function more than corrective exercise alone in hyperkyphotic adolescent girls. DESIGN: This is a single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: One hundred eighteen adolescent hyperkyphotic girls were allocated randomly into two equal groups. Control group received only corrective exercise, while study group received diaphragmatic release in addition to corrective exercise. Primary outcome was Cobb angle, assessed by lateral radiographs. Secondary outcomes were pulmonary function testing, assessed by computerized spirometery. Outcomes were assessed before and after treatment, after 3 mos of interventions, in both groups. RESULTS: Two-way analysis of variance revealed that both Cobb angle and pulmonary function testing significantly improved after treatment in both groups ( P < 0.001). Time*group interaction revealed that the study group had a superior improvement in Cobb angle and pulmonary function testing compared to the control group ( P < 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adding diaphragmatic release to 3 mos of multimodal corrective exercise program showed superior improvements in Cobb angle and pulmonary function testing than corrective exercise alone in hyperkyphotic adolescent girls within a shorter timeframe compared to previous studies. These results strengthen the hypothesis of its potential as a beneficial addition to the treatment of thoracic hyperkyphosis.

      "abstract": "Advanced post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis (PTAO) is a severe condition that affects less than one percent of the population, with rare incidence. It accounts for less than 5% of all osteoarthritis (OA) cases. Physiotherapy enhances functionality by strengthening the dynamic stabilizers of the ankle, such as the calf, soleus, tibialis anterior, and peroneal muscles, and by improving proprioception, which aids in balance and coordination. As OA progresses, individuals may experience early losses in their ability to perform everyday activities and job tasks. Occupational therapy and cardiovascular exercises are crucial for conserving energy while walking and improving posture at work. This case report involves a 39-year-old male who presented to the hospital with pain, swelling, difficulty walking, and an equinus deformity. After diagnosing him with ankle arthritis, the orthopedic specialist recommended an X-ray. Medication and physical therapy were administered to educate and rehabilitate the patient, aiming to improve pain, range of motion (ROM), strength, and walking capacity. A four-week treatment plan, along with medication, resulted in significant improvements in pain reduction, ROM, strength, and walking ability. This case report also underscores the importance of focusing on preoperative care to ensure that post-surgery, the hip and knee ranges are normal, and the patient experiences less difficulty walking. Future studies are needed to explore this condition further and to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound therapy in such cases, as it was not effective in reducing pain in this instance."

DESIGN: A total of 39 male soccer players were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial, aged between 18 and 23 years who were divided into 3 groups: Only Exercise, IASTM, and FR. METHODS: All participants performed daily strengthening and stretching exercises, while 1 group added IASTM, and the other added FR to the exercise program. We evaluated ITB tightness with the Ober test and an inclinometer, pressure pain threshold, using an algometer, and we evaluated muscle strength with the Cybex Norm Isokinetic device. RESULTS: We found that all 3 groups exhibited an increase in the Ober inclination angle after the interventions (P = .001), but the increase was greater for participants in the IASTM and FR groups, compared with exercise alone. Additionally, both the IASTM and FR groups displayed an increased pressure pain threshold (P = .001), whereas there was no change in the control group. Moreover, while all 3 groups experienced an increase in hip muscle strength (P = .001), the IASTM and FR groups exhibited a greater increase compared with exercise alone (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, exercise improves pain, range of motion, and muscle strength in athletes with ITB tightness, and IASTM, and FR techniques enhanced exercise effects but did not differ from one another. While our study demonstrated that both IASTM and FR techniques significantly enhance the benefits of exercise for athletes with ITB tightness, further research could delve into the long-term effects of these interventions.",

Myofascial release therapy (MFR) is frequently utilized to restore the extensibility of fascial tissue and is considered beneficial for various clinical conditions such as low back pain and ankle injuries. However, no studies have yet evaluated the effects of MFR on periscapular muscles activation and shoulder mobility in patients with subacromial pain syndrome(SAPS). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of MFR combined with supervised exercise(SE) and SE alone in patients with SAPS. DESIGN: Assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. SUBJECTS: Subacromial pain syndrome patients. METHODS: Fifty participants were divided into two groups: SE group and MFR + SE group, each group 25 cases. Both treatment methods were performed 5 times a week for 4 weeks. MAIN MEASURES: Shoulder pain severity was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS); shoulder range of motion (ROM) by a goniometer; functionality by shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI); and periscapular muscles activation by sEMG. All measurements were evaluated both pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: An ANOVA analysis indicated no significant group by time interactions for flexion ROM and resting VAS (p > 0.05). However, significant group by time interactions were found for SPADI, abduction and external rotation ROM, and activity VAS (p < 0.05). Post-hoc tests revealed significant improvements in SPADI, abduction and external rotation ROM, and activity VAS in both groups compared to pre-treatment (p < 0.05). Additionally, there were significant group by time interactions for the sEMG values of the upper trapezius and serratus anterior (p < 0.05). Post-hoc tests showed that compared to pre-treatment, the MFR + SE group had decreased upper trapezius sEMG values and increased serratus anterior sEMG values(p < 0.05), while the SE group showed increased serratus anterior sEMG values(p < 0.05). After the 4-week intervention, there were significant between-group differences in SPADI, abduction and external rotation ROM, activity VAS, and sEMG values of the upper trapezius and serratus anterior(p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Four weeks of MFR combined with SE can increase shoulder ROM, improve pain, and thus enhancing functional activities in patients with SAPS. Additionally, it can further improve the balance between the upper trapezius and serratus anterior to improve the dynamics of the periscapular muscles. TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: ChiCTR2200061054.

METHODS: Eighty individuals with neck myofascial syndrome were randomly divided into 4 groups: (1) MR protocol with a TENS conductive glove (MR+TENS), (2) MR protocol without TENS (MR), (3) conventional TENS protocol (TENS), and (4) placebo TENS (control). All participants attended 6 sessions over a period of 3 weeks. The following measures were evaluated at baseline, at the third week, and at the 1-month follow-up: Pain with the visual analog scale (VAS pain), upper trapezius pressure pain threshold (PPT) with pressure algometry, cervical range of motion (ROM) with goniometry, and disability with the neck disability index (NDI). A 2-way ANOVA with repeated measurements was applied. RESULTS: Significant changes between the 3 intervention groups and the control group were noted in the VAS and the NDI scores (P < .05) with the MR+TENS group exhibiting the biggest difference. Additionally, MR significantly increased PPT compared to TENS, and even further when applied with the conductive glove (P < .05). Regarding lateral flexion ROM, MR was equally effective either alone or in combination with the glove compared to TENS (P < .05). In contrast, TENS did not appear to affect neck PPT and ROM (P > .05). Finally, no difference between the groups was detected in cervical rotation ROM (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The MR protocol appears to be more effective in dealing with pain, disability, and lateral flexion ROM than conventional TENS. A TENS conductive glove significantly improves the effects of MR, possibly due to the combined mechanical and electrical stimulation of the muscle.",

This study was aimed to investigate the impact of traditional static stretching (STR) and self-myofascial release (MFR) in adolescents with HMS hip. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial. Adolescent athletes with HMS hip were grouped as 23 STR and 23 MFR. Foam rolling was employed as the training method for MFR. Both interventions were performed twice a day for 20 minutes in 6 weeks. The training was filmed and distributed via the mobile video. Self-assessed Copenhagen Hip & Groin Outcome Score, ROM, strength, and hop tests were measured before and after the interventions. The healthy side without limitations was designated as non-HMS (nHMS) and taken as reference value. RESULTS: The study participants had limitations in flexion (FLX), abduction (ABD), internal rotation (IR), and external rotation (ER). The ROM of STR group was recovered to nHMS level. The FLX and ABD of MFR group was also recovered, however the IR and ER had lower angles compared to nHMS. MFR FLX, ABD, ER strength, and single hop test were restored like that of nHMS, however STR group was substantially lower than nHMS despite the improvements. Both groups depicted lower pre-intervention Copenhagen Hip & Groin Outcome Score subscale activities daily living, sport, and physical activity compared to nHMS. Activities daily living and physical activity were improved to healthy levels after the intervention, however sport was lower than that of nHMS. CONCLUSION: Both STR and MFR had impact on hip mobility and hip self-assessment score. Furthermore, MFR had strength improvements in FLX, ABD, and ER. However, the improvements in MFR group regarding triples, crossover hops, and self-assessed sports were limited. Therefore, STR and MFR are effective in improving not only ROM but also muscle function asymmetry in HMS hip.",

      "abstract": "Among athletes, foam rolling is popular technique of myofascial release aimed to support recovery processes and counteract delayed onset muscle soreness. However, there is no consensus on the optimal parameters of the roller texture used in the procedure. The study aimed to determine whether using rollers with different textures and hardness (smooth/soft, grooved/mid, serrated/hard) in myofascial release affects post-exertional restitution rate and the level of perceived DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) after intense anaerobic exercise. The study involved 60 healthy and physically active men randomly divided into three experimental groups and one control group (passive rest)-each consisting of 15 individuals: STH-rolling with a smooth roller; G-rolling with a grooved roller; TP-rolling with a serrated roller; Pass-passive rest group. After performing a exercise test (one-minute high-intensity squat), blood lactate (LA), creatine kinase (CK) and pain perception (VAS Scale) were monitored. The analysis of the average LA concentration in the blood 30 min post-exercise showed a statistical difference for all rolling groups compared to the passive rest group: STH (p < 0.001), G (p < 0.001), TP (p = 0.035). No statistically significant differences were found between the CK measurement results in individual assessments. Statistically significant differences in VAS values were observed between G (p = 0.013) and TP (p = 0.006) groups and the Pass group at 48 h, as well as between STH (p = 0.003); G (p = 0.001); TP (p < 0.001) groups and the Pass group at 72 h. Based on statistical data, a strong influence (η2 = 0.578) of time on the quadriceps VAS variable was noted. The research results confirm the effectiveness of rolling in supporting immediate and prolonged recovery. The conducted studies indicate a significantly better pace of post-exertional recovery after a rolling procedure lasting at least 120 s. The texture and hardness of the tool used did not matter with such a duration of the treatment.",

A total of 79 female patients diagnosed with CPPS from January 2021 to December 2022 were prospectively analyzed. Every patient received 3 weeks of treatment which included myofascial release therapy combined with electrical and magnetic stimulation. The visual analog score (VAS) of pelvic floor muscle (PFM) trigger points (TrPs) and the changes in pelvic floor surface electromyography before and after treatment were compared. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of each outcome index. There were significant differences in VASs of muscle TrPs before and after treatment (P < 0.05). For the surface electromyography of PFMs, the differences in pre-baseline rest, post-baseline rest, isometric contractions for muscle endurance evaluation, and coefficient of variation were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that disease course (X 1), dyspareunia (X 5), and urinary incontinence (X 6) were influencing factors for the decline of pre-baseline rest (r5 = 1.067, R 2 = 0.089), post-baseline rest (r1 = 0.055, r5 = 0.99, R 2 = 0.119), VASs of ischial spine (r5 = 0.916, R 2 = 0.102), obturator internus (r5 = 0.796, r6 = -0.703, R 2 = 0.245), and pubococcygeus (r5 = 0.885, R 2 = 0.149) after treatment in the CPPS group. This study confirmed that individualized myofascial release therapy combined with electrical and magnetic stimulation has significant efficacy for patients with CPPS. At the same time, it is more effective for CPPS patients with longer course of disease, dyspareunia, and without urinary incontinence."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is common and costly, and conventional care is often inadequate for pain resolution. Although evidence supports movement and manual therapy treatments, the benefits of the synchronous application of these two therapies are sparsely documented and poorly understood. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old female presented to a chiropractic practice within a large multispecialty clinic with chronic right-sided thoracolumbar and posterior ribcage, abdominal wall, and anterior hip pain, despite extensive medical workup and multifaceted treatment. INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION: Initial chiropractic treatment entailed manual therapy and yoga-based home exercise prescription. Outcome measures during the first two months of treatment fluctuated erratically. In an effort to facilitate at-home yoga practice and to bolster the patient's self-efficacy, myofascial release therapy was combined synchronously with in-clinic yoga practice (\"yoga release therapy\", YRT). OUTCOMES: The shift in treatment to YRT was associated with improvements measured on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instrument, including: pain rating (50 - 20), pain interference (60 - 47), sleep disturbance (54 - 37), anxiety (46 - 42), fatigue (57 - 43), physical function (32 - 51), and social function (44 - 65). CONCLUSION: These outcomes indicate a potential role for YRT in an integrative approach to managing MSK pain. They justify prospective research to validate YRT's efficacy and explore its mechanisms.",

To investigate the effectiveness of TOCT on balance, quality of life, and disease symptoms when combined with myofascial release in pwPD. METHODS: Twenty-six pwPD were randomized into two groups for this randomized controlled study. The groups received TOCT three days a week for eight weeks. At the end of each session, the myofascial release was applied to the neck, trunk, and lumbar region with three sets of 60-s foam rolling body weight (Intervention group-IG) and perceived discomfort level 0/10 (Control group-CG) using a numeric rating scale. Primary outcome measures were measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8), and Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Secondary outcome measures included posturographic assessment, timed-up and go test (TUG), Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), and rolling time. RESULTS: Data obtained from 26 pwPDs in equal numbers in both groups were analyzed. All groups reported a significant change in MDS-UPDRS, MDS-UPDRS-III, PDQ-8, TIS, and rolling time after treatment compared to pretreatment. Post-hoc analyses showed that IG significantly improved motor symptoms, TUG, and TIS dynamics compared to CG. The mediolateral limits of stability and anterioposterior limits of stability distances of IG increased (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Myofascial release, when combined with TOCT, may help to reduce disease-related motor symptoms and improve dynamic balance in pwPD. These findings suggest that myofascial release can be a beneficial addition to TOCT programs for pwPD.Clinical Trial Number: NCT05900934 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

      "abstract": "Pain in the lower back is a major concern in today's era due to prolonged sitting in two-wheeler riders, mainly due to hamstring tightness. It also creates physical disability and impairment in activities of daily living. The study aimed to compare the efficacy of muscle energy technique (MET) and self-myofascial release (SMFR) using the foam roller on hamstring flexibility, dynamic balance, and physical disability amongst two-wheeler riders with chronic low back pain (LBP). Participants were randomized into two intervention groups, MET and SMFR using the envelope method, with each group having 20 participants. Hamstring flexibility and range of motion for knee extension and the lower back were assessed using the active knee extension test (AKE-L and AKE-R) and sit and reach test (SRT), while the dynamic balance was assessed by the star excursion balance test (SEBT) and physical disability by Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, (RMDQ). Measurements were taken at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention. This study demonstrated that both SMFR using a foam roller and MET are effective in enhancing hamstring muscle flexibility, (SRT-F(1, 38) = 299.5, p < 0.001; AKE-R-F(1, 38) = 99.53, p < 0.001; AKE-L-F(1, 38) = 89.67, p < 0.001). Additionally, these techniques significantly improved dynamic balance in various directions, including anterior (ANT), anteromedial (AMED), medial (MED), posteromedial (PMED), posterior (POST), posterolateral (PLAT), lateral (LAT), and anterolateral (ALAT) directions (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in physical disability (RMDQ-F(1, 38) = 1307, p < 0.001), among two-wheeler riders suffering from chronic LBP. Compared to MET, SMFR using foam rollers was found to be more effective in enhancing hamstring flexibility, improving balance, and decreasing disability level on the RMDQ after 4 weeks.",

The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the PEDro scale, and the certainty of evidence was reported using the GRADE scale. The overall effect size was calculated using the robust variance estimator, and subgroup analyses were conducted using the Hotelling Zhang test. (3) Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall effect size results indicated that the myofascial release intervention had a moderate effect on ROM performance in athletes when compared to the active or passive control groups. (4) Conclusions: Alternative MRTs, such as myofascial trigger point therapy, can further improve the ROM performance of athletes. Gender, duration of intervention, and joint type may have a moderating effect on the effectiveness of MRTs."

Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) facilitates waste drainage and improves soft tissue tension in peripheral tissues. To date, no studies have investigated how the combination of MLD, MWM, and MFR influences the human body. The purpose of this study is to determine how the combination of MLD, MWM, and MFR affects DFROM and balance ability. We randomly assigned 16 individuals (26 feet) to one of three groups: MWM-MFR (MR), MWM-MLD (MD), or MWM-MFR-MLD (MRD) intervention. To confirm the intervention effect of each group, DFROM was assessed using a modified lunge test, and dynamic balance was measured using a modified star excursion balance test. In the results, differences were found between the MR and MRD groups in PL and mGCM activities in the 1 section (p = 0.008, p = 0.036) and between the MD and MRD groups in mGCM activity in the 4 and 5 sections (p = 0.049, p = 0.004). We suggest that the application of MRD is the most effective intervention for increasing muscle activation of the PL and mGCM during the modified star excursion balance test."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression affects a significant portion of the global adult population, with chronic pain patients being particularly susceptible to severe depression. Pain and mental illness contribute to an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, affecting heart function. Myofascial release promises to improve mental and physical health by addressing fascial dysfunctions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the influence of myofascial release on emotional states and autonomic nervous system functioning in individuals with chronic neck pain and depression. Additionally, it seeks to evaluate the myofascial release effect on fascial properties, pain intensity and sensitivity, and cervical spine range of motion. METHOD: Experimental Study. RESULT: The study revealed significant enhancements in the myofascial release group, such as a substantial reduction in pain perception and stiffness, increased range of motion of the cervical spine, heart rate variability, positive affect, and pressure pain threshold. The effect sizes of these improvements ranged from small to large. No significant differences were observed in elasticity and tone. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that myofascial release has a positive impact on individuals with chronic neck pain and depression, particularly in reducing pain intensity. Integrating myofascial release into treatment approaches may be beneficial. However, further research is needed to confirm and expand upon these findings, explore long-term effects, and better understand the clinical significance of certain outcomes.

METHODS: To conduct a literature search and identification; PRISMA-ScR guidelines were followed. Relevant articles were searched for from the following medical and health sciences electronic databases: PubMed, EBSCOhost, CENTRAL of the Cochrane Library, and the Physiotherapy Evidence-Based Database (PEDro). Patients with chronic neck pain were eligible for the scoping review. RESULTS: Seven articles were included in this review. This scoping review found that there is heterogeneity in the prescription of MFR and MET and a greater tendency to check three major physical dimensions (pain, range of motion, and disability). Various studies have opted for distinct intervention regimens, resulting in disparities in the frequency of weekly interventions, which can range from biweekly to five times a week. These inconsistencies may lead to perplexity among practitioners, as each intervention modality demonstrates favorable outcomes for individuals with persistent cervical discomfort. Moreover, a significant proportion of research projects have employed the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and visual analog scale (VAS) for data quantification. CONCLUSION: According to results, majority of the studies were focused on pain and missing components of range of motion and quality of life. Work-related factors can act as risk factors for chronic neck pain. Future investigations should adopt a comprehensive methodology and incorporate QoL assessments of quality of life."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Myofascial release is a popular therapy technique used to manipulate connective muscle tissue to become more pliable. The maintenance of body posture relies on mechanoreceptors located in connective tissue, thus manipulation of connective tissue should affect postural control. The effects of this phenomenon have not been well studied, leaving room for this investigation. PURPOSE: To observe if postural sway scores changed before and after foam rolling proximal (quadriceps and hamstrings) in comparison to distal (calves) muscles. METHODS: Thirty-six, college-aged female athletes (age 20.39 ± 0.25 years, mass 68.70 ± 1.97 kg, height 170.18 ± 1.56 cm.) performed approximately two and one-half minutes of moderate intensity foam rolling to their calves (n = 19, Group A) or to their hamstrings and quadricep muscle (n = 17, Group B). Center of Pressure (CoP) and Limit of Stability (LoS) testing was assessed both pre- and post-foam rolling using a computerized posturography balance plate. CoP sway was measured under both eyes open (EO) and eye closed (EC) Conditions on both stable and unstable surfaces. LoS was measured in the Anterior, Posterior, Left, and Right Directions. Effects of foam rolling on CoP and LoS were assessed using a repeated-measures MANOVA (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Eyes Open Stable Surface had the lowest postural sway (p = 0.001). However, CoP did not differ for any condition either between Groups (p ≥ 0.6) or from pre- to post-foam rolling (p = 0.3). LoS significantly differed between Directions such that LoS was greater in the frontal plane than in the sagittal plane (p = 0.011). There was also a significant Time X Group X Direction interaction effect (p = 0.001) such that LoS for Group A decreased after foam rolling (mean change = -1.621 cm) but increased for Group B after foam rolling (mean change = + 0.878 cm). No differences were found for any other Direction (p ≥ 0.1). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated CoP and LoS improvements between the two groups based on acute effects of foam rolling intervention. Further research is suggested to determine if long-term gains are observed within or between groups."

The risk of bias was evaluated utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. RESULTS: Pooled results showed that MFR intervention significantly reduces pain intensity [SMD = -2.01, 95% CI (-2.98, -1.03), I2 = 90%, P < 0.001] and improves disability [SMD = -1.3, 95% CI (-1.82, -0.79), I2 = 74%, P < 0.001].

CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis results indicate that MFR intervention can significantly alleviate pain and disability in TTH and CGH. For migraine, however, the results were inconsistent, and there was only moderate quality evidence of disability improvement for TTH and CGH. In contrast, the quality of other evidence was low or very low.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding plays a primary role in the events that characterize the development of the relationship between a mother and her newborn. However, this essential process sometimes does not fully cover the nutritional requirements of the newborn due to altered biomechanical sucking skills. In this context, adequate osteopathic treatment associated with neuromotor facilitation techniques could play a promoting role. METHODS: This study evaluated the effect of the osteopathic approach using myofascial release on 26 infants with ineffective sucking ability, identified by the POFRAS scale and LATCH score, compared with 26 untreated similar infants. After the procedure was initially performed in the hospital, the strategy based on basic neuromotor patterns was taught to the parents to be continued at home. The effects were measured at hospital discharge, during the first outpatient visit, which occurred after about seven days, and at one month of life. RESULTS: The number of valid and continuous suctions, initially less than five per feed in both groups, at the first outpatient check-up was significantly higher (p < 0.00001) in the treated group. Exclusive breastfeeding, initially present in all enrolled children, was maintained mainly in treated children, both at discharge (p < 0.003), at outpatient follow-up (p < 0.00001), and at one month of life (p < 0.00001). Differences in growth and health conditions were not found between the groups. CONCLUSION: We believe that osteopathic treatment associated with neuromotor facilitation techniques can optimize newborns' sucking skills, improving the acquisition and duration of breastfeeding.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a muscle pain disorder characterized by the presence of Myofascial Trigger Point (MTrP) within a taut band, local tenderness, referral of pain to a distant site, restricted range of motion, and autonomic phenomena. The upper trapezius is the muscle most often affected by MTrPs. Manual myofascial release (MFR) and Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) are techniques of soft tissue release that are used to resolve MPS. Fifty six percent of physiotherapists complain of pain in multiple areas due to the massage and manual therapy that they have to perform. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to find whether IASTM is better than manual MFR in treating patients with MPS in upper trapezius. METHODS: This study was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial that included 31 participants, both males and females between the age groups of 18-50 years. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. Three sessions were given over a period of one week for both groups. Group A received IASTM along with conventional treatment and Group B received Manual MFR along with the conventional treatment. The outcome measures evaluated were pain, cervical range of motion, pain pressure threshold (PPT) of trigger points, and the neck disability index. Pre- and post-measurements were taken and the analysis was done. RESULTS: Both the treatment methods significantly reduced pain, improved PPT, range of motion, and function. The effects between the groups showed that IASTM was significantly better than manual MFR to reduce pain. The improvement in PPT, range of motion and function were equal in both the groups. CONCLUSION: IASTM and manual MFR both are effective individually as treatment procedures for pain, PPT, range of motion, and function. Neither of the treatment options can be considered better that the other. The clinician can decide based on the availability of the instrument, training, patient's preference, and his/her comfort whether which of the two treatment methods should be used."

Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group.

Patients with hemophilic arthropathy present joint damage, reduced range of motion, and decreased strength and functional capacity. Myofascial release therapy aims to decrease pain and improve tissue mobility and functionality. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of myofascial release therapy in patients with hemophilic ankle arthropathy. METHOD: Single-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty-eight adult patients with hemophilia were randomly allocated to the experimental group (myofascial release therapy with foam roller) or the control group (no intervention whatsoever). The daily home protocol of myofascial release therapy for the lower limbs using a foam roller lasted eight consecutive weeks. The primary variable was the safety of myofascial release therapy (weekly telephone follow-up). The secondary variables were pain intensity (visual analog scale), range of motion (goniometer), functional capacity (2-Minute Walk Test) and muscle strength (dynamometer), at baseline and at 8 and 10 weeks. RESULTS: During the experimental phase, none of the patients in the experimental group developed ankle hemarthrosis. There were statistically significant changes in time*group interaction in ankle dorsal flexion (F[1.75] = 10.72; p < .001), functional capacity (F[1.16] = 5.24; p = .009) and gastrocnemius strength (F[2] = 26.01; p < .001). The effect size of the changes after the intervention was medium-large in pain intensity (d = -1.77), functional capacity (d = 1.34) and gastrocnemius strength (d = 0.76). CONCLUSION: Myofascial release therapy is a safe form of physical therapy for patients with hemophilia. Myofascial release therapy can effectively complement prophylactic pharmacological treatment in patients with hemophilic arthropathy, improving range of motion in dorsal flexion, functional capacity and gastrocnemius strength.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The lower kinetic chain is known to be affected by hamstring tightness which causes biomechanical alterations. As per the literature, short hamstring might cause prolonged forefoot loading, which can cause higher repeated stress on the plantar fascia. There is evidence supporting the use of various stretching and myofascial release techniques for hamstring tightness, further research is needed to investigate their impact on plantar pressure. Hence the study aims to determine combined effect of myofascial release and passive stretching on plantar pressure in individual with hamstring tightness. METHODS: This was an experimental pre-post study design with 67 randomised screenings from asymptomatic health care science students aged 18 to 25. From this scientific survey, a sample size of 47 students having HMS tightness based on the popliteal angle were recruited using a universal goniometer. An intervention was proposed that included MFR and passive stretching in 3 sessions on alternate days. Plantar pressure of these individuals was noted by using the \"Harris and Beath foot printing mat\" before and after the intervention. RESULT: Significant pressure changes were observed after intervention: great toe of right side (p = 0.001), toes 2 to 5 of right side (p = 0.010) and left side (p = 0.008), first metatarsal of left side (p = 0.010), lateral forefoot of right side (p = 0.019) and left (p = 0.018), medial heel (p = 0.044), and lateral heel of right side (p = 0.025). These values substantiate the enhancement in plantar pressure. CONCLUSION: The combined effect of Myofascial release and passive stretching in an individual with hamstring tightness resulted in a significant increase in popliteal angle and plantar pressure.",

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. METHOD: Pilot study that non-probabilistically convenience sampling that selected butterfly swimmers who were simply randomized into three groups to receive the standard protocol (scapular mobilization with release of the subscapularis muscle by the lateral edge of the scapula and rib cage detachment) in intervention group (IG), sham group (SG) (scapular mobilization without subscapularis muscle release and without rib cage detachment) or no intervention in control group (CG). We evaluated the stroke frequency, length, and average speed of 30 swimmers using the 8.15 Kinovea® motion analysis system. RESULTS: The findings showed that, compared to the CG and IG, the SG showed a significant reduction in mean velocity (p = 0.002; p = 0.02, respectively), stroke frequency (p = 0.002; p = 0.003, respectively), and stroke length (p = 0.01; p = 0.05, respectively). DISCUSSION: The results showed that manual therapy through scapular mobilization without associated myofascial release with detachment of the scapula from the rib cage worsened the swimming efficiency indicators even after 30 min of application of the technique. The limitations of the studies are related to the sample size, the risk of non-probabilistic contraction bias and the lack of blinding of the evaluators. Thus, the results of this study should be evaluated with caution.",

METHODS: The single-blind, two-arm, randomised clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Physiotherapy, Sindh Institute of Physical Medicine, Karachi, from December 7, 2020, to March 24, 2021, and comprised patellofemoral pain syndrome of either gender with gluteus medius trigger point. They were randomly allocated to positional release technique group A and myofascial release technique group B. The intervention comprised 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks for a total of 18 sessions, with each session lasting 45 minutes. Function through anterior knee pain scale, pain through visual analogue scale, strength via hand-held dynamometer, and quality of life via World Health Organisation quality of life brief questionnaire were assessed alongside pressure pain threshold via algometer which was taken as the gluteus medius trigger point. All measurements were taken at baseline and 6 week post-intervention. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 64 participants, 38(59.4%) were females and 26(40.6%) were males.

Manual therapists often use myofascial release (MFR) to elongate restricted pectoral fascia to reduce FSP and improve shoulder function; however, the effects of this treatment approach remain anecdotal. OBJECTIVE: Determine the acute effects of 4-min of MFR, compared to a soft-touch control (CON), to the pectoral fascia on: 1) FSP, 2) shoulder horizontal abduction ROM (HA-ROM), and 3) muscle excitation of the trapezius (upper, middle, lower [UT, MT, LT]) and pectoralis major (PEC). METHODS: Fifty-nine right-handed participants (27 ± 9 years, 30 female) with FSP, but otherwise asymptomatic shoulders participated in a randomized crossover clinical trial by attending two experimental sessions: one MFR and one CON treatment, each administered by a Registered Massage Therapist. FSP, HA-ROM, and muscle excitation during a reaching task, were measured before and after each treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between treatment and time for FSP (p = .018, ηp = .093) with FSP decreasing from PRE MFR (128 ± 19 mm) to POST MFR (123 ± 19 mm; p < .001, ηp = .420) and PRE CON (126 ± 19 mm) to POST CON (124 ± 18 mm; p < .001, ηp = .191) interventions. There were no significant differences in HA-ROM or muscle excitation. CONCLUSION: Four minutes of MFR or CON to the pectoral fascia acutely reduces FSP.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four cervical radiculopathy patients were randomly assigned to either the myofascial release group or the exercise group. Both groups received conventional treatment. Additionally, the exercise group performed stretching and strengthening exercises while the myofascial release group received the myofascial release technique. The pain pressure threshold, muscle strength, cervical range of motion, pain, and disability variables were assessed for all patients. RESULTS: The myofascial release group demonstrated significantly larger improvements in flexion (p = 0.001), extension (p = 0.037), left rotation (p = 0.012), and left lateral flexion (p = 0.001) range of motions compared to the exercise group. Muscle strength in the wrist flexors (p < 0.001), wrist extensors (p < 0.010), biceps (p < 0.001) and triceps (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the myofascial release group compared to the exercise group. And, again, the myofascial release group demonstrated significantly larger improvements in wrist flexors (p < 0.001), wrist extensors (p < 0.001), biceps (p < 0.001), triceps (p < 0.001), pectorals (p < 0.001), subscapularis (p < 0.001), upper trapezius (p = 0.002), and the pain pressure threshold. Finally, the myofascial release group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain (p < 0.001) and disability (p < 0.001) scales compared to the exercise group. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the arm muscle strength and pain pressure threshold variables in patients with cervical radiculopathy may benefit clinicians in the preparation of treatments. Cervical radiculopathy symptoms may improve after the application of myofascial release techniques. A customized cervical exercise program and conventional treatment could be added to the non-surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy.",

Because of the complexity and multiple influencing factors, chronic pain conditions are associated with a long treatment and diagnostic process. This leads to a prolonged healing process and high costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of myofascial release on the variables of pain and range of motion in patients with chronic neck pain. METHOD: Selection criteria were set to create a search algorithm for a systematic search in the databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, EBM Reviews, Medline, CINAHL, PEDro, and Science Direct. The risk of bias and the methodological quality was analyzed with the PEDro scale. RESULT: Ten randomized controlled trials, with 549 participants met the eligibility criteria. The methodological quality was ranked from good to excellent. The myofascial release showed a significant difference in pain (p =  0.03), rotation to the right (p =  0.05), and lateral flexion to the right (p =  0.04), compared to other treatment methods. No significant effect was found for improvements in pressure pain threshold. CONCLUSION: Modest effects are observed in pain reduction, suggesting potential benefits of myofascial release in managing chronic neck pain. Further research with standardized protocols and direct comparisons to established therapies is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of myofascial release efficacy.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine which mechanisms are operative in releasing the extraocular myofascial tissue in response to extraocular myofascial release (EOMR) and to evaluate the effect of EOMR on saccadic velocity and esodeviation angle in patients with convergence spasm. METHODS: Fourteen patients with convergence spasm aged 20-35 participated in this research. The treatment included touching the medial rectus and its interrelated fascial tissue with the index finger pulp from over the eyelid for at least 300 s and applying very gentle and uniform pressure. We evaluated the saccadic velocity obtained from dynamic electrooculography (EOG) and the angle of deviation. The findings of dynamic EOG were used as a reliable quantitative method to assess eye movement function. RESULTS: The amount of esodeviation decreased significantly at both far 2.39Δ, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.27-3.52) (P = 0.002) and near 5.57Δ, 95% CI (4.67-6.47) (P = 0.001) after two sessions of EOMR in a week. There was no significant difference in saccadic velocities before and after treatment. CONCLUSION: In the short term, the EOMR only affects the static condition of the eye. Therefore, a significant improvement could be seen in the deviometric findings. However, the dynamic properties of the extraocular muscles did not improve and probably needed a more extended treatment period for acting the long-term mechanisms."

      "abstract": "Therapists and strength and conditioning specialists use self-myofascial release (SMR) as an intervention tool through foam rollers or massage rollers for soft tissue massage, with the purpose of improving mobility in the muscular fascia. Moreover, the use of SMR by professional and amateur athletes during warm-ups, cool downs, and workouts can have significant effects on their physical performance attributes, such as range of motion (ROM) and strength. The purpose of this study was to analyse the literature pertaining to these types of interventions and their effects found in different physical performance attributes for athletes. A systematic search was carried out using the following databases: PUBMED, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane, including articles up to September 2023. A total of 25 articles with 517 athletes were studied in depth. SMR seems to have acute positive effects on flexibility and range of motion, without affecting muscle performance during maximal strength and power actions, but favouring recovery perception and decreasing delayed-onset muscle soreness. Some positive effects on agility and very short-range high-speed actions were identified, as well. In conclusion, although there is little evidence of its method of application due to the heterogeneity in that regard, according to our findings, SMR could be used as an intervention to improve athletes' perceptual recovery parameters, in addition to flexibility and range of motion, without negatively affecting muscle performance."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Self-myofascial release (SMR) is a form of self-massage aiming to release tension, improve blood flow, and alleviate muscle soreness. This study aimed to determine whether a single session of SMR could impact cardiovascular parameters at rest and during a cold pressor test (CPT). METHODS: Twenty male participants (aged 26 ± 2 years) underwent a 20-min SMR and a 20-min seated control condition (CON) on two separate test days in a randomized order. Peripheral and central blood pressure (BP), total peripheral resistance (TPR), pulse wave velocity (PWV), heart rate (HR), root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD), and the quotient of low-frequency power and high-frequency power (LF/HF) were measured both at rest and during a CPT before (t0), 2 min (t1), and 20 min (t2) after the SMR and CON. RESULTS: Time × condition interactions could be detected for peripheral and central diastolic BP, TPR, HR, and RMSSD. Following the SMR, peripheral diastolic BP, central diastolic BP, TPR, and RMSSD were reduced, while HR was increased compared to the CON. Regarding the CPT time × condition interactions could be detected for peripheral, and central diastolic BP, with lower values after SMR. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that a single bout of SMR confers favorable cardiovascular benefits in healthy normotensive individuals. Furthermore, SMR can attenuate the hemodynamic reactivity to a stress test. Future research should address whether regular SMR leads to chronic adaptations similar to regular, moderate aerobic exercise, massage therapy, and static stretching.",

METHOD: Systematic review conducted in four databases from 2017. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of two forms of soft tissue mobilization on athletes' performance. The risk of bias was analyzed using the Cochrane Handbook scale. RESULTS: Ten studies were included for qualitative analysis. IASTM increased range of motion, knee joint kinetic force, peak torque, and angular velocity in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. The technique increases isometric strength and isokinetic power in vertical jumping. FRSMR was relevant in counter movement jumping between the pre- and post-intervention conditions, mainly by increasing strength in the initial jumping phase. CONCLUSIONS: IASTM should be used in sports preparation to improve muscle response and explosive force production. FRSMR increases flexibility as it tends to restore tissue elasticity, but it does not improve aerobic activity. The suggested time for strategy intervention is at least 90 s per muscle group.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a highly prevalent syndrome. Previous studies showed that extracorporeal shockwave therapy and myofascial release therapy could improve the quality of life in patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Theoretically, combined therapy with extracorporeal shockwave therapy and myofascial release therapy will likely have significant advantages in treating CP/CPPS. We, therefore, present a protocol for conducting a well-designed randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of each therapy. METHODS: The proposed study will be a three-group randomized control trial (RCT) design that includes 150 participants from Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University, with equal allocation of participants to the three intervention groups. The study duration will be 8 weeks, which includes a 4-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period. The primary outcome will be the changes in surface electromyography (sEMG) assessment and National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). The secondary outcomes will include the changes in three-dimensional quantification, shear wave elastography (SWE), and sympathetic skin response (SSR) testing. Assessments will be conducted before the intervention (T0), before the 5th intervention (T1), immediately after the 8th intervention (T2), and the 4th week after the end of the 8th intervention (T3). DISCUSSION: This trial will compare the differences in efficacy between single extracorporeal shockwave therapy, single myofascial release therapy, and combined therapy to select the most appropriate treatment option for patients with CP/CPPS. The possible pathogenesis of CP/CPPS would also be analyzed by comparing the intercorrelation between each objective and subjective measurement (NIH-CPSI score, sEMG, SWE, SSR).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of isolated myofascial release techniques (MFR) in the treatment of CLBP in adults. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies published from 1 January 2013 to 1 March 2023. We included English-language randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of isolated MFR performed by a specialist on adults with CLBP. Only studies with a comparison group without treatment or with sham MFR were included. A total of 373 studies were detected, of which 6 studies were finally included in this review. There was a total of 397 CLBP patients aged 18-60 in all study groups. The studies evaluated the effects of a series of MFR treatments as well as a single intervention. After applying a series of treatments, a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity, improvement in the range of motion, reduction in the level of functional disability and fear-avoidance beliefs, as well as a decrease in the activity of paraspinal muscles at maximum trunk flexion were demonstrated. A single, 40-min complex intervention involving tissues at various depths significantly reduced the level of pain, improved the range of motion, and reduced the resting activity of paraspinal muscles in the standing position, but did not affect postural stability. The use of a single 5 min MFR technique did not affect pain intensity and sensitivity and functional disability. The findings suggest that the use of a series of isolated MFR improves the condition of patients with CLBP by reducing the intensity of pain, improving functional efficiency, and reducing the activity of the paraspinal muscles in the position of maximum forward bend. The use of a single intervention containing a set of techniques covering superficial and deep tissue also reduces the intensity of pain, improves mobility, and reduces the resting activity of the paraspinal muscles in a standing position. Given the small number of eligible studies with limitations, conclusions should be interpreted with caution and avoid overgeneralizing the benefits of isolated MFR based on limited or mixed evidence."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential effectiveness of myofascial release compared to passive muscle stretching and to a control group in modulating pain intensity and health status in adults diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A preliminary randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted, consisting of eight weekly sessions. The participants were divided into three groups: myofascial release group (RG = 13), a muscle stretching group (SG = 13), and a control group (CG = 12), which received advice from a rheumatologist. The outcomes measured were the visual analogue pain scale (VAS), the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) (representing health status), and the number of painful areas. Univariate analyzes of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed at baseline, after 4 weeks (during treatment), after 8 weeks (post-treatment), and after 12 weeks (follow-up). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) were included as covariates. Clinical trial registration number: NCT: 03408496. RESULTS: After eight weeks, the RG showed lower VAS scores compared to the CG (mean difference 95% CI: -5.10 to -1.26) and the SG (mean difference 95% CI: -4.9 to -0.23) with no difference between the SG and the CG. The total FIQ score for the RG was lower than the CG after 4 weeks (95% CI: -49.92 to -5.61), and 8 weeks (mean difference 95% CI: -52.72 to -15.73), although there was no difference between the RG and SG, as well as between the SG and CG, at both time points. The number of painful body areas was similar in all groups at the four time points. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest that the RG possibly showed greater improvements in pain intensity and health status compared to the CG, and possibly greater improvements in pain intensity compared to the SG.",

This study aimed to examine the effect of the self-myofascial release of the lower back on myofascial gliding, lumbar flexibility, and abdominal trunk muscle strength using a roller massager. This crossover study included 24 college athletes who underwent three interventions-roller massage, static stretching, and control (rest). Before and after the intervention, lumbar and fascial gliding were evaluated using ultrasonography. Long-seat anteflexion (lumbar flexibility) and abdominal trunk muscle strength were assessed. The movement velocities of the subcutaneous tissue and the multifidus muscle over time were calculated using echo video analysis software, and gliding was estimated using the cross-correlation coefficient between the velocities. Gliding, lumbar flexibility, and abdominal trunk muscle strength showed significant intervention-by-time interactions. Roller massage significantly improved gliding, lumbar flexibility, and abdominal trunk muscle strength. The self-myofascial release of the lower back using a roller massager improved the lumbar/fascia gliding, lumbar flexibility, and abdominal trunk muscle strength compared to static stretching."

A paucity of literature exists about the effect of the gross myofascial release (MFR) technique on the management of LBP. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of gross MFR when given as an adjunct to conventional physical therapy in subjects with low back pain with radiculopathy. METHODS: Forty subjects (n=40) clinically diagnosed with LBP with radiculopathy were enrolled and randomly allocated to either the control group (n=20) or the experimental group (n=20). Both study groups received 5 sessions of intervention. The control group received conventional physical therapy while the experimental group received gross MFR of the trunk and lower limb along with conventional physical therapy. The outcome measures included were pressure pain threshold for the lower back and lower extremity, lumbar flexion and extension range of motion (ROM), percentage disability, and patient satisfaction towards the treatment which were measured pre-intervention (day 1) and post-treatment (day 5). The interaction between group and time was analysed using two-way mixed ANOVA. RESULTS: The results suggested that the experimental group was statistically significant over the control group in terms of pressure pain threshold in the lower back (p<0.001) and lower limb (p=0.003), disability (p<0.001), and patient satisfaction (p=0.034) and lumbar flexion (p=0.002) except lumbar extension ROM (p=0.973). CONCLUSION: When given as an adjuvant to conventional physical therapy, gross myofascial release proved to provide a significant and faster short-term improvement over conventional treatment alone in subjects diagnosed with low back pain with radiculopathy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hamstring tightness is prevalent among college-going students aged 18-25 years, leading to an increased risk of recurrent injury, reduced athletic performance, post-exercise soreness, and decreased coordination. Myofascial release and neurodynamic sliding technique are two interventions used to alleviate this issue. Myofascial release is a concept that involves pain originating from the muscle and fascia. The neurodynamic sliding technique is a method of producing sliding movement of neural structures relative to their mechanical interfaces. METHODS: This study involved 70 individuals with hamstring tightness who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants were assigned to Group A or Group B using a convenient sampling method. Group A received neurodynamic sliding technique treatment, while Group B received a self-myofascial release. Both interventions were administered for two months. The outcome measures used in this study were active knee extension and lower extremity functional scale, which were evaluated before and after the intervention. RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS: Within-group comparisons indicated that both Group A and Group B showed significant improvements in hamstring flexibility. Between-group comparisons of active knee extension (AKE) and lower extremity functional scale (LEFS) immediately after the intervention showed statistically significant results. These findings suggest that both the neurodynamic sliding technique and self-myofascial release are effective in improving hamstring flexibility. This study has implications for clinical practice, as both interventions may be used to address hamstring tightness. CONCLUSION: Our study found that both the neurodynamic sliding technique and self-myofascial release can improve hamstring flexibility. However, the neurodynamic sliding technique was found to be more effective than self-myofascial release. Further research is necessary to determine the optimal protocol for these interventions and their effectiveness in clinical populations with hamstring tightness or injury."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many fascial therapies have been demonstrated to positively affect the range of motion, pain sensitivity, balance, daily functioning, and participation in social activities. Among these therapies, myofascial release has been extensively studied and widely used in clinical trials. The fascial distortion model was recently introduced, and it has received much attention due to its rapid onset of action and ease of application. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the effects of myofascial release and the fascial distortion model on range of motion, pain sensitivity, and balance, with the goal of helping therapists select the most appropriate treatment. METHODS: Sixteen healthy adults were included in a prospective, randomized, single-blind study. The subjects were randomly assigned to either the myofascial release or fascial distortion model groups. The outcome measures were functional reach test, pain pressure threshold, straight leg-raising test angle, and finger floor distance. RESULTS: The myofascial release and fascial distortion model groups showed significantly increased straight leg-raising angle and finger floor distance, but no between-group differences were observed (p > .05). The fascial distortion model group demonstrated significantly better pain control (p < .05), which was also better than in the myofascial release group (p < .05). The myofascial release group showed significantly improved balance control (p < .05); however, there was no difference between the two groups (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Either myofascial release or fascial distortion model can be chosen to improve the range of motion. However, if pain sensitivity is the goal, it is expected that the fascial distortion model will be more effective.",

METHODS: Thirty-three college students with a mean age of 21.33 ± 0.98 involved in distance learning due to the Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19) restriction were randomized to receive either IASTM on the upper trapezius and levator scapulae muscles or MRT. Researchers measured their pain with a visual analog scale (VAS), function with neck disability index (NDI), and pain pressure threshold (PPT) with a pressure algometer. The subjects received eight therapy sessions over four weeks and outcome measures were assessed pre and post-intervention. The study was registered as a clinical trial on clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT05213871). RESULT: Unpaired t-test showed no statistical significance between the two groups post-intervention regarding improvement in pain, function, and PPT (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study showed insignificant differences between groups. However, we did not use a control group, indicating that the improvement in outcomes may not have been caused by the intervention. STUDY DESIGN: Quasi-experimental two groups pre-posttest clinical trial. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapy, level 2b.",

[Subjects] Sixty-four subjects, aged 30-60 years, with a diagnosis of plantar heel pain, plantar fasciitis, or calcaneal spur by a physician according to ICD-10, were equally allocated to the MFR (n = 32) and SDM (n = 32) groups by hospital randomization and concealed allocation. [Methods] In this assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial, the control group performed MFR to the plantar surface of the foot, triceps surae, and deep posterior compartment calf muscles, while the experimental group performed a multimodal approach utilizing the SDM concept for 12 sessions over 4 weeks. Both groups also received strengthening exercises, ice compression, and ultrasound therapy. Pain, activity limitations and disability were assessed as primary outcomes using the Foot Function Index (FFI) and Range of motion (ROM) assessment of the ankle dorsiflexors and plantar flexors using a universal goniometer. Secondary outcomes were measured using the Foot Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and a 10-point manual muscle testing process for the ankle dorsiflexors and plantar flexors. [Results] Both MFR and SDM groups exhibited significant improvements from baseline in all outcome variables, including pain, activity level, disability, range of motion, and function after the 12-week intervention period (p < .05). The SDM group showed more improvements than MFR for FFI pain (p < .01), FFI activity (p < .01), FFI (p < .01) and FADI (p = <.01). [Conclusion] Both MFR and SDM approaches are effective in reducing pain, improving function, ankle range of motion, and reducing disability in plantar heel pain, however, the SDM approach may be a preferred treatment option.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients were divided into treatment groups: DN (n=15) and IMR (n=15). Therapeutic efficacy regarding pain perception and tolerance of masticatory, facial, and cervical muscles, bite force, and distribution of occlusal contacts were analyzed in this observational longitudinal clinical study pre/post-intervention and pre/post one month of therapeutic intervention. The data were tabulated and statistically analyzed (repeated measures and Bonferroni post-hoc test, p<0.05). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in pain between the groups in the comparison of pre- and post-intervention with effect on time versus intervention in the head and neck. Pain perception and tolerance showed a statistical effect of time on the temporal, suboccipital, sternocleidomastoid, mental (right and left), right masseter, and left trapezius muscles. There was a statistically significant effect of the intervention on the mentalis, supraorbital, and infraorbital (right and left) muscles. There was a statistically significant effect of the interaction on the upper masseter (right and left), anterior temporal (left), suboccipital, sternocleidomastoid, and mentalis (left) muscles. There was an increase in post-intervention molar bite force in the groups, with a statistical effect on time versus intervention in the right and left regions. Contact of occlusal forces at the maxilla/mandible interface showed a difference between the mean times on teeth 26-36 after versus 1 month after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The two therapeutic techniques are viable for the treatment of muscular temporomandibular disorders; however, IMR proved to be more effective immediately after the intervention and after one month.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Supportive interventions to improve breastfeeding practice are needed in nursing. This study investigated the effects of pectoralis major myofascial release massage (MRM) on breast pain and engorgement among breastfeeding mothers and on breast milk intake and sleep patterns among newborns. METHODS: Breastfeeding mothers who had delivered between 37 and 43 weeks and had 7-to 14-dayold newborns were recruited from a postpartum care center in Gunpo, Korea. Participants were randomized to the MRM or control group. The outcome variables were breast pain and breast engorgement among breastfeeding mothers and breast milk intake and sleep time among newborns. The experimental treatment involved applying MRM to separate the pectoralis major muscle and the underlying breast tissue in the chest. After delivery, the first MRM session (MRM I) was provided by a breast specialist nurse, and the second (MRM II) was administered 48 hours after MRM I. RESULTS: Following MRM, breast pain (MRM I: t=-5.38, p&lt;.001; MRM II: t=-10.05, p&lt;.001), breast engorgement (MRM I: right, t=-1.68, p =.100; left, t=-2.13, p=.037 and MRM II: right, t=-4.50, p&lt;.001; left, t=-3.74, p&lt;.001), and newborn breast milk intake (MRM I: t=3.10, p=.003; MRM II: t=3.09, p=.003) differed significantly between the groups. CONCLUSION: MRM effectively reduced breast engorgement and breast pain in breastfeeding mothers, reducing the need for formula supplementation, and increasing newborns' breast milk intake. Therefore, MRM can be utilized as an effective nursing intervention to alleviate discomfort during breastfeeding and to improve the rate of breastfeeding practice (clinical trial number: KCT0002436)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive narrowing and collapse of pharyngeal airway during sleep, leading to apnoea or hypopnoea. In this context, myofunctional therapy and myofascial release might be effective, despite the literature on the combination of these approaches is still scarce. OBJECTIVES: This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of oro-facial myofunctional therapy combined with myofascial release in terms of functioning in patients with mild OSA. METHODS: Patients aged from 40 to 80 years with diagnosis of mild OSA were randomly allocated into intervention group (oro-facial myofunctional therapy plus myofascial release) and control group (only oro-facial myofunctional therapy). At the baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T1), and after 8 weeks (T2), the following outcomes were assessed: apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI), average oxygen saturation (SpO2 ), sleep time spent with oxygen saturation < 90% (T90), snoring index, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: Out of the 60 patients enrolled, 28 (aged 61.46 ± 8.74 years) complete the treatment in the intervention group and 24 (aged 60.42 ± 6.61 years) in the control group. There were no significant differences in AHI between groups. A significant difference was reported for ΔT0-T1 SpO2 (p = .01), T90 (p = .030), ΔT0-T1 and ΔT0-T2 snoring index (p = .026 and <.001 respectively), and ΔT0-T1 and ΔT0-T2 Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (p = .003 and <.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: Taken together, a combination of oro-facial myofunctional therapy and myofascial release showed a potential treatment for sleep quality in patients with mild OSA. Future studies are necessary to better investigate the role of these interventions in OSA patients.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Anatomy trains theory states that performing techniques in any part of the superficial myofascial backline can remotely treat other parts of this pathway. Due to the connections of different parts of the superficial backline, it is possible to influence the hamstring by performing the technique in the lumbar area. As chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP) may lead to or be caused by hamstring tightness, remote myofascial release (MFR) techniques using the superficial backline can help improve hamstring tightness. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of remote MFR on hamstring tightness for those with chronic nonspecific LBP. DESIGN: Single-blind, parallel design. SETTING: The present study was performed at the clinical setting of Tarbiat Modares University in Iran. METHODS: This study included 40 participants (20 males and 20 females) who were 40.5 (5.3) years old with chronic nonspecific LBP and hamstring tightness. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly divided into the lumbar MFR (remote area) and hamstring MFR groups. Participants underwent 4 sessions of MFR for 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A passive knee-extension (PKE) test was used for muscle tightness evaluation 3 times. RESULTS: Repeated-measure analysis of variance test showed that after the lumbar and hamstring MFR, the PKE was significantly reduced in both legs: lumbar MFR (right knee: from 61.04° [2.17°] to 51.01° [4.11°], P ≤ .003 and left knee: from 63.02° [3.12°] to 52.09° [2.48°], P ≤ .004) and hamstring MFR (right knee: from 62.01° [4.32°] to 50.50° [7.18°], P ≤ .001 and left knee: from 63.11° [2.56°] to 51.32° [5.31°], P ≤ .002). Least Significant Difference (LSD) post hoc test results showed that the 2 groups were not significantly different after the MFR (P ≥ .05). Also, the intraclass correlation coefficient index showed that the PKE test has excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, .910 for the right limb and .915 for the left limb). The minimal detectable change at the 95% confidence interval indicated that a change greater than or equal to 6° is required to exceed the threshold of the error PKE test, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the remote MFR technique to the lumbar region demonstrated the same significant results in decreasing hamstring tightness as was noted in hamstring MFR to both limbs in patients with chronic nonspecific LBP.",

Participants in the myofascial release group received 4 sessions of myofascial release to the lumbar region. The remote release group received 4 myofascial release sessions to the crural and hamstring fascia of the lower limbs. Low back pain severity and elastic modulus of the lumbar myofascial tissue were assessed before and after treatment by the Numeric Pain Scale and ultrasonography examinations. RESULTS: The mean pain and elastic coefficient in each group before and after myofascial release interventions were significantly different (P ≤ .0005). The results showed that the changes in mean pain and elastic coefficient of the 2 groups after myofascial release interventions were not significantly different from each other (F1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 = 1.48, P = .230, 95% confidence interval) (effect size = 0.22). CONCLUSION: The improvements in the outcome measures for both groups suggest that remote myofascial release was effective in patients with chronic nonspecific LBP.

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Inflammatory processes in the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) lead to thickening, compaction, and fibrosis and are thought to contribute to the development of nonspecific low back pain (nLBP). The blood flow (BF) of fascial tissue may play a critical role in this process, as it may promote hypoxia-induced inflammation. The primary objective of the study was to examine the immediate effects of a set of myofascial release (MFR) techniques on the BF of lumbar myofascial tissue. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the influence of TLF morphology (TLFM), physical activity (PA), and body mass index (BMI) on these parameters and their correlations with each other. (2) Methods: This study was a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty pain-free subjects (40.5 ± 14.1 years) were randomly assigned to two groups treated with MFR or a placebo intervention. Correlations between PA, BMI, and TLFM were calculated at baseline. The effects of MFR and TLFM on BF (measured with white light and laser Doppler spectroscopy) were determined. (3) Results: The MFR group had a significant increase in BF after treatment (31.6%) and at follow-up (48.7%) compared with the placebo group. BF was significantly different between disorganized and organized TLFM (p < 0.0001). There were strong correlations between PA (r = -0.648), PA (d = 0.681), BMI (r = -0.798), and TLFM. (4) Conclusions: Impaired blood flow could lead to hypoxia-induced inflammation, possibly resulting in pain and impaired proprioceptive function, thereby likely contributing to the development of nLBP. Fascial restrictions of blood vessels and free nerve endings, which are likely associated with TLFM, could be positively affected by the intervention in this study."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of myofascial release and muscle energy on acute outcomes in trunk extensors active range-of-motion and strength in recreationally resistance-trained women. Seventeen apparently healthy women performed three experimental protocols using a cross-over, randomized (counterbalanced in Latin Square format), and within-subjects design: a) range-of-motion and strength test after a manual myofascial release protocol (MFR); b) flexibility and strength test after a muscle energy protocol (ME); and c) range-of-motion and strength test without myofascial release or muscle energy (control condition). Active trunk range-of-motion was measured via a sit-and-reach test and trunk extension strength via isometric dorsal dynamometer. A significant increase in range-of-motion was found for MFR (p = 0.002; d = 0.71) and ME (p < 0.001; d = 0.47) when comparing post-intervention with baseline values. Similarly, a significant increase for strength was found for MFR (p = 0.018; d = 0.10) when comparing post-intervention with baseline values. In conclusion, both techniques (MFR and ME) improved trunk range-of-motion with the sit and reach test immediately post-intervention; however, MFR showed greater magnitude increases in range-of-motion (MFR: (medium magnitude) vs ME: small magnitude). Due to the potential health implications, both (MFR and ME) responses should be among the many considerations for rehabilitation and performance exercise prescription when prescribing an exercise regimen.",

However, no studies in the literature performed both diaphragmatic and iliopsoas MFR techniques in patients with chronic low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of diaphragmatic and iliopsoas MFR techniques on pain, lumbar spine range of motion (ROM), chest wall mobility, and flexibility in patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two participants with chronic low back pain, aged between 20 and 50 years. INTERVENTION: The sample was randomly allocated into one of two groups; the myofascial group (n = 21) and control group (n = 21) received the MFR technique or the placebo MFR technique as a complementary therapy to traditional physiotherapy treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were pain, chest wall mobility, lumbar spine range of motion (ROM), and flexibility. Secondary outcomes were depression, kinesiophobia, and functional disability. RESULTS: The MFR techniques significantly reduced the pain, with a between-group difference of -2.05 (95% CI, -2.93 to -1.15) for rest, -2.62 (95% CI, -3.34 to -1.89) for trunk flexion, and -2.00 (95% CI, -2.84 to -1.16) for trunk extension in favor of the EG. MFR techniques significantly increased the lumbar spine ROM after interventions, with a between-group difference of 16.67° (95% CI, 8.87 to 24.47) for flexion, 7.63° (95% CI, 5.44 to 9.80) for extension and, 9.53° (95% CI, 6.57 to 12.48) for right lateral flexion. There was also a significant difference between the groups in flexibility in favor of the MG of 1.95 cm (95% CI, 1.41 to 2.49) for MST, -13.52 cm (95% CI, -20.18 to -6.86) for trunk flexion and, -4.37 cm (-6.50 to -2.28) for right lateral flexion The MFR techniques also significantly increased the chest wall mobility after interventions, with a between-group difference of 2.52 cm (95% CI, 1.82 to 3.23) for the xiphoid region and 3.48 cm (95% CI, 2.60 to 4.36) for the subcostal region.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most frequently observed disorders of the musculoskeletal system in the modern population. It is suggested that myofascial disorders in the highly innervated thoracolumbar fascia (TLF), reported in patients with LBP, may be an underlying cause of the ailment. Research also confirms that patients with LBP demonstrate poorer postural stability compared with individuals without the condition. Myofascial release techniques (MFR) are additional therapeutic options that complement existing therapies and help provide a more holistic treatment for chronic LBP (CLBP). OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of changes in postural stability following one MFR intervention applied to CLBP subjects immediately after manual therapy and after a month. It was hypothesized that postural stability is going to aggravate immediately after the MFR intervention and improve one month after treatment compared with the baseline results before the treatment. METHODS: 113 patients with CLBP participated in a randomized-controlled trial. The experimental group (n = 59) received one MFR intervention, whereas the control group (n = 54) did not receive any therapeutic intervention. Posturography was performed to determine experimental group's immediate response to the therapy and to evaluate the experimental and control groups' responses to the therapy one month after the intervention. RESULTS: Only 2 out of 12 comparisons of stabilometric parameters demonstrated reliable effects that are in line with our research hypotheses. Even though both comparisons were observed for therapy outcomes within the experimental group, no reliable differences between the groups were found. CONCLUSIONS: A single MFR treatment in the TLF did not affect postural stability in CLBP patients in the experimental group. Further studies are needed to extend the findings by performing a series of holistic MFR treatments applied to a larger area of the body surface that would induce more general tissue changes and thus having a greater impact on postural stability.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This prospective intervention study was designed to determine the efficacy of a standardized Preflight/Postflight Stretches (PPS) protocol to reduce subjective neck and back pain scores in helicopter aircrew. Aircrew transient back and neck pain is well documented, and there is currently no standardized preflight and postflight stretching protocol for Naval Aviation. METHODS: Subjects were recruited from two carrier air wing MH-60R squadrons at Naval Air Station Jacksonville. These carrier air wing squadrons were selected to control for size (number of aircrew), age, and operational tempo (number of flight hours). Subjects consisted of both pilots and enlisted aircrew. One squadron was designated as the control group, although the second squadron served as the intervention group. Subjects from both groups filled out the questionnaire. Only the intervention group completed the PPS protocol immediately after completing the questionnaire and before departing the squadron spaces for the aircraft outside. Upon landing, the aircrew completed a postflight debrief. Only the intervention group completed the PPS protocol after debrief. Both the intervention and control groups once again completed the questionnaire. Questionnaires were matched by using a generated anonymous subject ID. The amounts of change and pain levels were then compared using the Mann-Whitney test and the Fisher's exact test, respectively. RESULTS: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test found the data to be nonparametric. The preflight and postflight overall (P ≤ .001), cervical (P ≤ .001), thoracic (P = .006), and lumbar (P = .004) differences between the control and intervention groups were found to be statistically significant when using the Mann-Whitney test. Preflight and postflight pain differences in the sacral region and \"other\" section were not found to be statistically significant (sacral, P = .618; others, P = .182). When evaluating the worsening of the pain level, 50 (92%) of the control flights in which PPS was not performed reported worse pain, compared to 21 (61.8%) in the intervention group where PPS was performed. The Fisher's exact test found the association between performing PPS and the worsening in pain to be statistically significant (P = .001) in the overall, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Therefore, the hypothesis was accepted in regard to overall pain, as well as in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. CONCLUSION: Aircrew back and neck pain because of flying is well documented. However, there is no standardized stretching protocol for aircrew to perform immediately preflight or postflight in U.S. Naval Aviation. This study demonstrated that PPS, a simple 5- to 7-min stretching routine, gives aircrew structure and can reduce postflight cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and overall pain. This phase proved to be safe as no adverse events were reported. The prehabilitation aspect could reduce conventional medical intervention, costly pharmacological management of neck and back pain, and be applied to other aviation populations in military and civilian communities.",

Objective: This study seeks to compare the effects of myofascial release with Findings-Oriented Orthopedic Manual Therapy (OMT) combined with Foam Roller (FR), versus FR by itself, on the physical performance of university athletes. A randomized controlled study was conducted with a total of twenty-nine university athletes, measuring Range of Motion (ROM), jump height and flight time, strength and dynamic flexibility using Goniometer pro, CMJ protocol in OptoGait, 1 Repetition Maximum (1RM) and Mean Propulsive Velocity (MPV) and the Sit and Reach (V) test, correspondingly. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov prior to the initial measurement of the participants under the code NCT05347303. Through a univariate analysis, together with an analysis of independent groups with ANOVA and an analysis of covariance, it was evidenced that OMT combined with FR generated more and better effects in all the evaluated ROM, jump height and flight time, RM and VMP tests. Finally, it was found that OMT combined with FR is better when it is desired to improve ROM, muscle power, strength and flexibility, while FR alone only improves dynamic flexibility.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of a single exercise session of Self-Myofascial Release (SMR) on the posterior muscular chain flexibility after one hour from the intervention. Thirty-six participants performed SMR using a rigid ball under the surface of both feet. Participants were tested with the Sit and Reach (S&R) test at four different times: before (T0), immediately after (T1), 30 (T2), and 60 (T3) minutes after the SMR intervention. The sample (n = 36) was categorized into three groups: (1) flexible, (2) average, and (3) stiff, based on the flexibility level at T0 (S&R values of >10 cm, >0 but <10 cm and <0 cm, respectively). For the whole sample, we detected significant improvements in the S&R test between the T1, T2, and T3 compared to T0. The stiff group showed a significant (p < 0.05) improvement between T1−T2 and T1−T3. Results were similar between the average group and the whole sample. The flexible group did not show any significant difference (p > 0.05) over time. In conclusion, this investigation demonstrated that an SMR session of both feet was able to increase posterior muscular chain flexibility up to one hour after intervention. Considering that a standard training session generally lasts one hour, our study can help professionals take advantage of SMR effects for the entire training period. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that physical exercise practitioners should also assess individuals’ flexibility before training, as the SMR procedure used in this work does not seem necessary in flexible individuals.",

DESIGN: A randomized, single-blinded, cross-over, controlled trial. SETTING: An outpatient rehabilitation clinical setting. POPULATION: Thirty patients with BCRL. METHODS: Within a crossover design with randomized treatment sequences, fifteen subjects received MFR for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of washout period, and then received placebo MFR and the other fifteen subjects received interventions in the reverse order. Each session had a 60 min process including either MFR or placebo MFR for 30 min, followed by complete decongestive therapy for 30 min twice a week. Upper limb volume as the primary outcome and subjective pain, shoulder range of motion (ROM), chest mobility, shoulder function, and quality of life as secondary outcomes were assessed before and at the end of each intervention period. RESULTS: There were significant differences in upper limb volume after both MFR and placebo MFR (P<0.05) while no significant difference between MFR and placebo MFR treatments was found (P>0.05). MFR-based treatment also achieved a greater improvement than placebo MFR-based treatment in subjective pain and shoulder ROM (P<0.05), except for internal rotation, and shoulder function. CONCLUSIONS: MFR-based treatment showed clinical improvement in shoulder function, induced by decreased edema volume and pain, and improved ROM and chest mobility. However, a further study with parallel randomized controlled trials to confirm what was achieved in the present study. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: MFR-based treatment is considered an important part of BCRL rehabilitation. Moreover, MFR-based treatment may be safe for patients with BCRL.",

      "abstract": "Background: Hemophilic ankle arthropathy is manifested by degenerative functional alterations (reduced muscle strength, mobility, and proprioception) and chronic pain. Myofascial release techniques are used to treat soft tissue adhesions, relieve pain, and reduce tissue sensitivity. The aim was to evaluate the safety of self-induced myofascial release in patients with hemophilic ankle arthropathy and to assess possible changes in musculoskeletal variables. Methods: We recruited 20 patients with ankle hemophilic arthropathy. Patients carried out a daily self-induced myofascial release exercise program using a foam roller over a period of 8 weeks. The primary variable was the frequency of hemarthrosis (regular telephone follow-up). Secondary variables were pain intensity (visual analog scale), range of motion (goniometry), and functional capacity of the lower limbs (six-minute walk test). Three evaluations were performed: pre-treatment (T0), post-treatment (T1), and at 8 weeks follow-up (T2). Results: There was a lower, non-significant, association in the frequency of hemarthrosis between the experimental and follow-up periods, compared to the pre-study period (SE = 0.50; 95%CI: −1.67; 0.28). There were significant within-subject changes in intensity of pain (T0: 4.91; T1: 2.79; T2: 2.46; p < 0.001), plantar flexion (T0: 125.55; T1: 131.5; T2: 130.30; p = 0.01), and functionality of the lower limbs (T0: 173.06; T1: 184.85; T2: 178.39; p = 0.009). Conclusions: Self-induced myofascial release is safe in patients with hemophilic ankle arthropathy. A protocol based on self-induced myofascial release can lead to changes in pain intensity, range of ankle motion in plantar flexion, and functionality in hemophilic patients."

      "abstract": "Increased muscle stiffness can result in a reduced range of motion (ROM) and impaired function. An increased ankle injury risk has been associated with reduced ankle dorsiflexion ROM. Although self-myofascial release (SMFR) is commonly used in clinical and sporting settings, little is known about its impact on gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon (AT) stiffness. As a result, we investigated how SMFR using a foam roller (FR) affects gastrocnemius-AT complex stiffness and ankle dorsiflexion ROM. According to these results, self-myofascial relaxation of the gastrocnemius and an improvement in ankle dorsiflexion ROM can be accomplished by rolling an FR along the calf. Myofascial release (MFR) is a type of manual therapy that involves stretching the myofascial complex with a light load and for a long duration in order to restore optimal length, relieve pain, and improve function. Viscoelastic deformation is the rapid increase in muscle length following stretching."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) is first-line therapy for treatment of pelvic floor tension myalgia (PFTM). Pelvic floor trigger point injections (PFTPI) are added if symptoms are refractive to conservative therapy or if patients experience a flare. The primary objective was to determine if a session of physical therapy with myofascial release immediately following PFTPI provides improved pain relief compared to trigger point injection alone. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 87 female patients with PFTM who underwent PFTPI alone or PFTPI immediately followed by PFPT. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores were recorded pre-treatment and 2 weeks post-treatment. The primary outcome was the change in VAS between patients who received PFTPI alone and those who received PFTPI followed by myofascial release. RESULTS: Of the 87 patients in this study, 22 received PFTPI alone and 65 patients received PFTPI followed by PFPT. The median pre-treatment VAS score was 8 for both groups. The median post-treatment score was 6 for the PFTPI only group and 4 for the PFTPI followed by PFPT group, showing a median change in VAS score of 2 and 4, respectively (p = 0.042). Seventy-seven percent of patients in the PFTPI followed by PFPT group had a VAS score improvement of 3 or more, while 45% of patients in the PFTPI only group had a VAS score improvement greater than 3 (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: PFTPI immediately followed by PFPT offered more improvement in pain for patients with PFTM. This may be due to greater tolerance of myofascial release immediately following injections.",

Iliotibial band friction syndrome is a common chronic overuse injury caused by repetitive knee use in cycling. Self-myofascial release using foam rollers is an effective intervention for this syndrome; however, studies reporting positive results on self-myofascial release in cycling are limited. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of self-myofascial release on pain and iliotibial band flexibility, heart rate, and exercise performance (cadence, power, and record) in adult male cyclists with iliotibial band friction syndrome. We evaluated the pain and exercise ability of the control (n = 11) and self-myofascial release (n = 11) groups before and after cycling twice. Significant differences were observed in the pain scale, the iliotibial band flexibility, and cycling pain and power. The posterior cadence of the self-myofascial release group was 3.2% higher than that of the control group. The control group's record time increased by 74.64 s in the second cycling session compared to the first cycling session, while that of the self-myofascial release group decreased by 30.91 s in the second cycling session compared to the first cycling session. Self-myofascial release is effective in relieving pain and may improve cycling performance by increasing the iliotibial band flexibility.",

Muscle soreness usually lasts for a few days, if not longer. This muscular rigidity and stiffness cause spasms in upper trapezius fibres, culminating in neck discomfort in the posterior side of the neck and shoulder area. This protocol was designed to describe the study to evaluate the effect of myofascial release (MFR) versus high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief and functional improvement in subjects with trapezius myalgia. Methods: Forty-five subjects with trapezius myalgia meeting inclusion criteria were selected for the study. Two groups were created, with group A undergoing MFR therapy and group B undergoing high-frequency TENS. The procedure was completed within four weeks. Regular assessments were carried out in the first week and fourth week of the rehabilitation. Throughout the recovery process, we evaluated pain, functional improvement, and range of motion of the neck at regular intervals. The outcome measures taken were the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Neck Disability Index (NDI). Discussion: The intervention's efficacy was assessed by looking at pain alleviation using the outcome measures. The study's findings strongly supported the application of these approaches and modalities in the rehabilitation of myalgia patients."

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Medline, Wiley Online Library, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data, and the Cochrane Library were searched until 12 September 2022. REVIEW METHODS: This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022302485). Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias assessment, and the quality of the evidence followed the GRADE recommendation. The outcomes pain, cervical mobility (Flexion, Extension, Rotation, lateral flexion), trapezius and suboccipital pressure pain thresholds (PPT), neck disability index (NDI), and adverse effects were extracted. RESULTS: After screening of 346 studies, 13 studies and 601 participants met the inclusion criteria. All studies were of moderate methodological quality. Compared with the control group, the participants in the MFR group showed significantly greater improvements trapezius PPT SMD 0.41 (95% CI 0.11-0.72), suboccipital PPT SMD 0.47 (95% CI 0.21-0.72), respectively. The differences were not significant to support the MFR treatment on pain, flexion, extension, rotation, lateral flexion angle, and NDI. None of the studies reported any adverse events. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that MFR is an effective treatment for the improvement of PPT of trapezius and suboccipital muscle in patients with chronic MNP.

      "abstract": "Background Recent work has examined an association between leg length discrepancy (LLD) and low back pain (LBP). Myofascial release (MFR) techniques are thought to be frequently applied in the treatment of chronic and acute LBP. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a practical measure of LLD and the feasibility of an MFR technique in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods In 12 subjects (seven women and five men) with acute LBP and LLD greater than 3 mm, an MFR technique was performed on the thoracolumbar fascia. At the baseline, after the intervention, and at follow-up, LLD was measured using a cross-line laser and finger-to-floor distance, and the pain was measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients completed a questionnaire after follow-up to assess the acceptability of the study procedure. The therapist evaluated the methods in terms of their feasibility. Results LLD measurement and MFR treatment required little time and few resources. Participants agreed to the study procedure with moderate to high acceptance. The LLD decreased by 5 mm after treatment and by 4 mm at follow-up. The VAS showed a reduction in pain of 17.50 mm at follow-up but not immediately after treatment. Conclusion The measurement of LLD is applicable in daily osteopathic practice, but it cannot be assumed to be a valid method for an RCT. Validated methods such as video raster stereography are, therefore, recommended. Comprehensive RCTs to study the effects of MFR intervention on leg length are feasible."

As the full range of motion is seldomly used, this group of muscles commonly go into tightness which in turn may be a predisposing factor in development of back pain and knee pain. METHODS: 54 healthy individuals were selected after screening for bilateral hip adductor tightness by measuring hip abduction range of motion using goniometer. They were randomized to either mobilization with movement (MWM) adductor stretch, myofascial release, or conventional stretching group. All subjects were assessed pre and post intervention. Outcome measure used were hip abduction range of motion and bent knee fall out test. RESULTS: Statistically significant difference was noted between the experimental and the control group in terms of hip abduction range of motion and bent knee fall out test. CONCLUSION: Intervention showed significant results in all three groups; however, MWM adductor stretch when used in conjunction with conventional stretching has proved to be more effective than myofascial release with foam roller and conventional stretching in increasing the abduction range of motion and bent knee fall out test.",

The study involved 40 male soccer players, who were randomly divided into two groups: experimental and control. The tests used did not show significant differences in the analyzed variables before the experiment (baseline measurement p > 0.05), while significant intergroup differences appeared for subsequent measurements, both for reference MVC values (p < 0.01 - for % gluteus maximus MVC, p < 0.001 - for % biceps femoris MVC) and for raw EMG values (p < 0.01 gluteus maximus and p < 0.001 - for % 0.0001 for biceps femoris). The use of self-myofascial release within the hamstring muscles leads to changes in the electrical potential of the muscles of the lower limb."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Currently, the use of self-myofascial release (SMR) instruments is not uncommon in our society, especially in sports. The most common SMR instruments are foam rollers, roller massagers, and balls. Regardless of the instrument used, the main objectives are to enhance performance and recovery. Nevertheless, many studies point out that there is still a lack of robust scientific evidence documenting the exact mechanisms that explain its true effects, therefore some authors affirm that the reported benefits are anecdotal in nature. OBJECTIVE: This overview aims to summarize, from systematic reviews, the effectiveness of SMR instruments on performance and recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study followed the PRISMA principles. Systematic reviews were found on the electronic databases according to an established P (healthy active individuals) I (SMR using instruments) C (other treatment, placebo, sham, or no treatment) O (performance and recovery) S (systematic reviews) search strategy. Additionally, methodological analysis was performed using R-AMSTAR. RESULTS: Initially, it was found 15 systematic reviews. However, after methodological analysis, only 7 systematic reviews had sufficient quality to be included. From those, it was found that SMR using instruments is beneficial to enhancing short-term flexibility-related and recovery-related outcomes. Inconstant data was reported in muscular-related outcomes. Nevertheless, beyond pain during SMR, no major adverse effects were found. Different effects between time, pressure and other instrument characteristics were also found. CONCLUSION: SMR using instruments can be a safe intervention used in sports to enhance performance and recovery from previous training/competition or between matches."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impaired motor function and upper extremity spasticity are common concerns in patients after stroke. It is essential to plan therapeutic techniques to recover from the stroke. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of myofascial release with the tennis ball on spasticity and motor functions of the upper extremity in patients with chronic stroke. METHODS: Twenty-two chronic stroke patients (male-16, female-6) were selected to conduct this study. Two groups were formed: the control group (n=11) which included conventional physiotherapy only and the experimental group (n=11) which included conventional physiotherapy along with tennis ball myofascial release - in both groups interventions were performed for 6 sessions (35 minutes/session) per week for a total of 4 weeks. The conventional physiotherapy program consisted of active and passive ROM exercises, positional stretch exercises, resistance strength training, postural control exercises, and exercises to improve lower limb functions. All patients were evaluated with a modified Ashworth scale for spasticity of upper limb muscles (biceps brachii, pronator teres, and the long finger flexors) and a Fugl-Meyer assessment scale for upper limb motor functions before and after 4 weeks. Nonparametric (Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test) tests were used to analyze data statistically. This study has been registered on clinicaltrial.gov (ID: NCT05242679). RESULTS: A significant improvement (P < .05) was observed in the spasticity of all 3 muscles in both groups. For upper limb motor functions, significant improvement (P < .05) was observed in the experimental group only. When both groups were compared, greater improvement (P < .05) was observed in the experimental group in comparison to the control group for both spasticity of muscles and upper limb motor functions. CONCLUSION: Myofascial release performed with a tennis ball in conjunction with conventional physiotherapy has more beneficial effects on spasticity and motor functions of the upper extremity in patients with chronic stroke compared to conventional therapy alone.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-specific neck pain is the most prevailing musculoskeletal disorder which has a large socioeconomic burden worldwide. It is associated with poor posture and neck strain which may lead to pain and restricted mobility. Physical therapists treat such patients through several means. Post isometric relaxation and Myofascial release therapy are used in clinical practice with little evidence to be firmed appropriately. So, this study was conducted to explore the effect of Post-isometric relaxation in comparison to Myofascial release therapy for patients having non-specific neck pain. METHODOLOGY: Sixty patients were randomly allocated to Post isometric group and the Myofascial group. The treatment period was of 2 weeks. All the patients were evaluated using the Visual analogue scale (VAS), Neck disability index (NDI), Universal Goniometer, and WHO BREF Quality of life-100 in the 1st and 6th sessions. Recorded data was entered on SPSS 21. Data were examined using two-way repeated ANOVA to measure the variance of analysis (group x time). RESULTS: Analysis of the baseline characteristics revealed that both groups were homogenous in terms of age and gender i.e. a total of 60 participants were included in this research study 30 in each group. Out of 60 patients, there were 20(33.3%) males and 40(66.7%) females with a mean age of 32.4(5.0) years. Participants in the Post Isometric group demonstrated significant improvements (p < 0.025) in VAS, NDI, Cervical Extension, left side rotation ranges, and QoL (Social Domain) at the 2-week follow-up compared with those in the Myofascial group. In addition, the Myofascial group indicated significantly better improvement in the mean score of CROM (flexion and right and left side bending). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated patients with nonspecific neck pain can benefit from the post isometric relaxation with significant improvement in pain, disability, cervical ROM, and Quality of life compared with myofascial release therapy.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown that changes in lumbar flexion angle and the pelvic inclination angle can be affected by the shortening of the lumbar muscles, which can cause low back pain. Decreased lumbar flexion angle and pelvic inclination angle can cause or exacerbate low back pain by disrupting the lumbo-pelvic rhythm. PURPOSE: This study aimed to use myofascial release techniques as a specialized treatment on muscle tissue to cause muscles to reach the optimal length and improve lumbar flexion angle and pelvic inclination angle, and thus improve low-back pain. SETTING: Non-specific low back pain patients, Tarbiat Modares University, Iran. PARTICIPANTS: 30 chronic non-specific low back pain participants were randomly assigned into two groups. RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a randomized control trial. INTERVENTIONS: The myofascial release group (n=15) underwent 4 sessions of myofascial release treatment based on Myer's techniques, and the control group (n=15) underwent 10 sessions of routine electrotherapy for two weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before starting the intervention and after the last treatment session, both groups were evaluated by the lumbar flexion angle with a flexible ruler, calculating the pelvic inclination angle by a trigonometric formula, and VAS measured the pain score of the participants. RESULTS: The results of the paired t test showed that, after treatment in both groups, the severity of pain and lumbar flexion angle changed significantly (p ≤ .001). However, the pelvic inclination angle was changed considerably only in the myofascial release group, and we did not see significant changes in the control group (p = .082). Also, the independent sample t test results to examine the between-group changes showed that changes in the myofascial release group were significantly different from the control group (p ≤ .000). Also, the effect size shows the large effect of the myofascial release technique compared to the control group (effect size ≥ 1.85). CONCLUSION: The present study results showed that myofascial release techniques in patients with low back pain could help decrease pain intensity and increase lumbar flexion and pelvic inclination angle. Based on the present study results, myofascial release can be a treatment to correct posture in patients with chronic non-specific, low back pain. Due to the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment."

Previous studies showed that myofascial release therapy (MFRT) could affect the respiratory muscle and adjunct fascia. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of MFRT techniques and respiratory physiotherapy, in comparison with respiratory physiotherapy alone, on improving cardiorespiratory parameter in patients with COVID-19. SETTING: A hospital affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Iran, from February to July 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty patients with COVID-19 participated in this study. RESEARCH DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized control design. INTERVENTION: The patients with COVID-19 randomly assigned to an intervention group who received respiratory physiotherapy combined with MFRT or a control group receiving respiratory physiotherapy alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, chest expansion, and ease of breathing were assessed at baseline and after the first and third session of treatment. Dyspnea and fatigue perception and 6-minute walking were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment. Patient's thoughts about the treatment were examined through the 4-point Likert scale. RESULTS: The ANOVAs found significant time effect for ease of breathing, dyspnea perception (F = 32.33, p < .01 and F = 11.72, p < .01, respectively). Also significant time by group interaction was found for chest expansion at xiphoid level (F = 4.02, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided evidence that both programs could result in improving ease of breathing and dyspnea perception, although the inclusion of MFR techniques into a respiratory physiotherapy program did not result in better outcomes in cardiorespiratory function of patients with COVID-19."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Low back pain is a major health issue in most industrialized countries. Lumbar fascia is supported as a potential source of pain in the lumbar region. Myofascial release is a manual therapeutic approach that focuses on restoring altered soft tissue function. On the other hand, one of the most commonly used physical therapy methods for low back pain is electrotherapy. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of lumbar Myofascial release and electrotherapy on clinical outcomes of Non-specific low back pain and elastic modulus of lumbar myofascial tissue. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient Low back pain clinic. SUBJECTS: 32 subjects with low back pain. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized into the myofascial release group (n = 16) and electrotherapy group(n = 16). Subjects in the myofascial release group received 4 sessions of myofascial release in the lumbar region, and the electrotherapy group received 10 sessions of electrotherapy. MAIN MEASURES: Low back pain severity, and elastic modulus of the lumbar myofascial tissue were assessed before and after treatment. RESULTS: An independent sample T-test was used to compare baseline variables in both groups (p > 0.05) (effect size≥0.83), Paired T-test was used to compare within-group changes after performing myofascial release and electrotherapy (p ≤ 0.023) (effect size≥0.56), and the GLM Anova test was used to Comparison of Changes in the Elastic Modulus of the Lumbar Spine and Low Back Pain between-group (F (10,21) = 12.10, P < 0.0005) (effect size = 0.86). CONCLUSION: The improvements in the outcome measures suggest that lumbar myofascial release may be effective in subjects with non-specific low back pain. Data suggest that the elastic modulus of lumbar fascia and the severity of low back pain are directly linked. Decreasing the elastic modulus after myofascial release can directly affect reducing low back pain.",

Self-induced myofascial release aims to treat fascial restrictions and improve functionality. AIM: This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of a self-induced myofascial release protocol in patients with haemophilic knee arthropathy. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with bilateral haemophilic knee arthropathy were recruited (n = 50 knees). The patients followed an intervention protocol, with daily exercises for 8 weeks. The dependent variables were: safety of the technique (periodic telephone monitoring), joint state (Haemophilia Joint Health Score), pain intensity (visual analogue scale), pressure pain threshold (pressure dynamometer), range of motion (universal goniometer) and hamstring flexibility (Fingertip-To-Floor test). The resulting values were measured at baseline (T0) and after the intervention (T1). Paired t-test compared the means between the assessments. Effect size was obtained using Cohen's d mean difference formula. The minimum detectable change of each variable was calculated. RESULTS: There were no cases of joint bleeding either during or after the procedure. The results showed improvements after the experimental period in joint state (Mean difference [MD]: 1.38; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: .94;1.81), pain intensity (MD: 1.19; 95%CI: .70;1.67), pressure pain threshold (MD: -23.25; 95%CI: -26.25;-19.84), flexion (MD: -4.36; 95%CI: -5.70;-3.01), loss of extension (MD: 4.10; 95%CI: 3.01;5.18) and hamstring flexibility (MD: 3.54; 95%CI: 2.61;4.46). CONCLUSIONS: Myofascial self-release using a foam roller is safe in patients with haemophilic knee arthropathy.

A group of 60 people suffering from flat feet with associated pain. Patients were assigned to four groups (15 people each): MF-myofascial release, E-the exercise program, MFE-myofascial release and the exercise program, C-no intervention. The rehabilitation program lasted 4 weeks. The NRS scale was used to examine pain intensity and FreeMed ground reaction force platform was used to examine selected static and dynamic foot indicators. Statistically significant pain reduction was obtained in all research. A static test of foot load distribution produced statistically significant changes only for selected indicators. In the dynamic test, statistically significant changes were observed for selected indicators, only in the groups subjected to therapeutic intervention. Most such changes were observed in the MF group. In the dynamic test which assessed the support phase of the foot, statistically significant changes were observed only for selected subphases. Most such changes were observed in the MFE group. Both exercise and exercise combined with myofascial release techniques, and especially myofascial release techniques alone, significantly reduce pain in a flat foot. This study shows a limited influence of both exercises and myofascial release techniques on selected static and dynamic indicators of a flat foot.",

Self-myofascial release is a flexibility technique, which is used to inhibit overactive muscle fibers. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the 8-week self-myofascial release on the isokinetic hamstrings-to-quadriceps strength ratio (H/QRatio) and the ROM of the knee joint among male athletes with the hamstring shortness. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four college-aged male athletes with hamstring shortness were selected for this study and were randomly assigned to a foam rolling group (FOAM, n = 12) and a control group (n = 12). INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the FOAM group performed supervised self-myofascial release program 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The control group received no intervention. METHODS: Data were analyzed via 2-way repeated-measure analysis of variance at the significance level of .05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ROM and the H/QRatio at the velocities of 60°/s, 120°/s, and 180°/s were measured by an isokinetic dynamometer. RESULTS: The results of 2-way repeated-measure analysis of variance demonstrated that hamstring ROM increased in FOAM group (P = .001). No significant changes were found in H/QRatio after self-myofascial release for FOAM group (P ≥ .05). CONCLUSIONS: When compared with other methods of stretching, self-myofascial release with foam rolling may be beneficial in increasing ROM without decreasing H/QRatio in people with the hamstring shortness.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Breast cancer survivors are known to develop upper torso pain and stiffness including shoulder elevation and ipsilateral inclination of the trunk within a short period of time as a result of cancer adjuvant therapies correlating with the type and side of surgery. Hence, the study. METHODS: Twenty-two breast cancer survivors at a tertiary care hospital, Belgaum, Karnataka, have participated in this pre-post experimental study which included myofascial release (MFR), stretching, and strengthening for four sessions per week for 3 weeks that is, a total of 12 sessions. The participants were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using photogrammetry for Posture and shoulder range of motion (ROM), flexicurve for spinal curvatures, digital inclinometer for cervical ROM, manual muscle testing and hand dynamometer for strength of the upper back, shoulder muscles and hand grip, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) for shoulder impairment and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) for quality of life. RESULTS: The outcomes were analyzed with a p-value set at ≤0.05. The results of the study demonstrated a substantial improvement in the posture alignment (p = 0.001), shoulder and cervical ROM (p = 0.001), upper back and shoulder muscle and hand grip strength (p = 0.001), SPADI (p = 0.001), and FACT-B (p = 0.001) values. DISCUSSION: The upper torso malalignment and muscular imbalance is seen in patients who has undergone surgeries involving the chest wall and early physiotherapy intervention can benefit the patients overall physical performance and quality of life. Hence, MFR, stretching and strengthening has shown to be beneficial in improving upper torso malalignment in breast cancer survivors. IMPLICATIONS OF PHYSIOTHERAPY PRACTICE: The suggested techniques can be applied at a larger scale which can involve patients with head and neck cancer since the areas of intervention are identical.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effect of self-myofascial release on muscle flexibility in long-distance runners. The study comprised 62 long-distance, recreationally running participants between the age of 20 and 45 years. The runners were randomly divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 32), in which subjects applied the self-myofascial release technique between baseline and the second measurement of muscle flexibility, and Group 2 (n = 30), without any intervention. The self-myofascial release technique was performed according to standardized foam rolling. Assessment of muscle flexibility was conducted according to Chaitow's proposal. After application of the self-myofascial release technique, higher values were noted for the measurements of the following muscles: piriformis, tensor fasciae latae muscles and adductor muscles. Within the iliopsoas and rectus femoris muscles, lower values were observed in the second measurement. These changes were statistically significant (p < 0.05) within the majority of muscles. All these outcomes indicate improvement related to larger muscle flexibility and also, an increase in range of motion. In the control group (Group 2), significant improvement was observed only in measurements for the iliopsoas muscles. The single application of self-myofascial release techniques with foam rollers may significantly improve muscle flexibility in long-distance runners. Based on these results, the authors recommend the self-myofascial release technique with foam rollers be incorporated in the daily training routine of long-distance runners, as well as athletes of other sport disciplines.",

METHODS: Thirty patients were randomly divided into two groups: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation group (n = 15) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation combined with myofascial release technique group (n = 15). Both treatment methods were performed 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Pain severity was assessed by Visuel Analog Scale, range of motion by a goniometer, muscle strength by digital hand dynamometer, quality of life by Nottingham health profile, functionality by arm, shoulder and hand problems questionnaire, disability by shoulder pain and disability index. All measurements were used before and after treatments. Pain severity, range of motion and muscle strength were also evaluated after the first session. RESULTS: After the treatment, shoulder pain, range of motion, muscle strength, functionality and disability were improved in two groups (p < 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation showed improvement in pain, whereas myofascial release technique improved pain, physical activity, emotional state, sleep and total dimensions of life quality (p < 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation was more effective in reducing activity pain, whereas myofascial release technique was more effective in increasing flexion, external and internal rotation range of motion, flexion and abduction muscle strength after the first session (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combined application of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and myofascial release technique has a more acute and cumulative positive effect on pain, range of motion, muscle strength, functionality, disability and quality of life in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The hamstring muscles are described as forming part of myofascial chains or meridians, and the superficial back line (SBL) is one such chain. Good hamstring flexibility is fundamental to sporting performance and is associated with prevention of injuries of these muscles. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of self-myofascial release (SMR) on hamstring flexibility and determine which segment of the SBL resulted in the greatest increase in flexibility. METHODS: 94 volunteers were randomly assigned to a control group or to one of the five intervention groups. In the intervention groups, SMR was applied to one of the five segments of the SBL (plantar fascia, posterior part of the sural fascia, posterior part of the crural fascia, lumbar fascia or epicranial aponeurosis) for 10 min. The analyzed variables were hamstring flexibility at 30 s, 2, 5, and 10 min, and dorsiflexion range of motion before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Hamstring flexibility and ankle dorsiflexion improved when SMR was performed on any of the SBL segments. The segments with the greatest effect were the posterior part of the sural fascia when the intervention was brief (30 s to 2 min) or the posterior part of the crural fascia when the intervention was longer (5 or 10 min). In general, 50% of the flexibility gain was obtained during the first 2 min of SMR. CONCLUSIONS: The SBL may be considered a functional structure, and SMR to any of the segments can improve hamstring flexibility and ankle dorsiflexion.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our review is aimed to find out the efficacy of Myofascial Release Technique (MFRT) based on the Randomised Controlled Trials, on flexibility when given along superficial back line (SBL) structures and to compare it with other soft tissue release techniques. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search on MEDLINE (Pubmed), Google Scholar, Science direct, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and Clinical Trial Database in English; up to April 2020 was undertaken. STUDY SELECTION: PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) was used for screening the relevant citations and reviewing the relevant studies. The literature searched total of 6,938 articles, however, only 68 were screened for eligibility. In the further screening, 16 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for our systematic review. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted into a table containing sample size, mean age of subjects, types of intervention, area to be treated, outcome measures used, and results of the accepted studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: 16 randomized controlled trials and cross-over trials were found to be eligible for our review. Quality assessment of the RCTs was done with the PEDro scoring method. Randomised clinical trials that studied the comparative effect of Myofascial Release (MFRT) technique with different MFRT techniques, control/sham, and other soft tissue release techniques like stretching, were included. Results of this analysis showed little evidence proving the additional effectiveness of MFRT treatment compared to other soft tissue release techniques for improving flexibility so as to consider it as the preferred treatment. Methodological aspects of selected studies for further research are suggested. Study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020179118). CONCLUSION: MFRT appears to be a good technique for improving flexibility. However, in comparison with other soft tissue release techniques, this therapy becomes less successful. More research is needed regarding its effectiveness.",

There are studies that have already evaluated the effect of MR on postural control, however, the data found are inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effect of MR on ankle plantar flexor muscles over static postural balance. METHOD: Sixty-five young men were randomized allocated into one of three groups: 1) MR group (n = 25, Myofascial Release); 2) Sham (n = 25, fake intervention); or 3) Control group (n = 15). Both MR and Sham techniques were applied during 5 min in the ankle flexors of each leg. The bipodal static postural balance test was performed before and 2 min post each intervention on a force plate with eyes closed during the test. All subjects performed 3 sets of 30-s with 1 min of rest. Mean values to the center of pressure velocity (COPvel) was used for analysis. RESULTS: The bipodal balance test showed that there was no significant difference between groups (p > 0.05), but there was a significant time effect (p < 0.05). A significant decrease (p < 0.05) in post-test COPvel (cm.s-1) values (sham 4.9 ± 1.2; MR 4.5 ± 0.6; CON 4.22 ± 0.8) was found when compared to values of pre-test (sham 5.3 ± 1.0; MR 5.0 ± 0.8; CON 4.94 ± 1.3) for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that MR performed on ankle flexors did not affect static postural balance in young man. This study is a clinical trial (Register Number: RBR-48k5jm).",

Evidence suggests that an alteration of central nervous system processing of pain could be involved. The purpose of this study is to analyze clinical records of patients affected by FM who underwent osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), predominantly based on a myofascial release approach (MFR). METHODS: This retrospective study considered records of 21 FM patients with moderate or severe functional impact, who consented to OMT in addition to their usual care. The assessment considered the following measures: FIQ (functional status), SF36 (quality of life), VAS (pain), TSK (kinesiophobia) and PSQI (quality of sleeping). Patients were preliminarily assessed over a 1 month run-in phase, then after 1, 2 and 4 months; a 1 month follow-up was also considered. RESULTS: After one month, 71% of patients reported a decrease in functional impact and scores remained stable until follow-up (from 69.8 to 52.37, p≤0.001). Overall, after four months, patients improved their quality of life, with a score ranging from 33.47 to 42.6 (p≤0.05). We also observed a reduction of pain (p≤0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A series of OMT sessions based on MFR could play a therapeutic role in improving functional status, pain and quality of life over a period of 4 months."

Reduced ankle dorsiflexion ROM has been associated with increased injury risk in the ankle. Self-myofascial release (SMR) has been widely used in clinical and sports settings, but the effects of SMR on gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon (AT) stiffness are unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of self-myofascial release using a foam roller (FR) on the stiffness of the gastrocnemius-AT complex and ankle dorsiflexion ROM. Fifty healthy, untrained, and non-sedentary participants (age=22.5±2.6years) were randomly divided into an intervention group (FR group) and a control group. The subjects in the intervention group received a single foam roller intervention (three sets of 1min), while the subjects in the control group performed a 5-min sedentary rest. Stiffness of the gastrocnemius-AT complex was evaluated using MyotonPRO and the ankle dorsiflexion ROM was assessed using the weight-bearing lunge test. For the foam roller and control groups, the between-group analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in gastrocnemius stiffness and ankle dorsiflexion ROM after intervention (p<0.05). Within-group analysis revealed a significant increase in ROM and a significant decrease in medial and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) stiffness for the foam roller group after the intervention (p<0.05). In addition, further analysis of the preintervention data revealed a significant negative correlation between ankle dorsiflexion ROM and AT stiffness (r=-0.378 and p=0.007). These results suggest that self-myofascial release using a foam roller on the calf is an effective method for decreasing the stiffness of the gastrocnemius and increasing ankle dorsiflexion ROM."

However, the effect of the patient's self-myofascial release (SMFR) is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of SMFR combined with biofeedback and electrical stimulation (BES) therapy in comparison with BES alone in patients with MFPP. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted. Sixty-eight patients were randomly allocated into BES-SMFR group (n = 34) and BES group (n = 34). Every patient received 4 weeks of treatment, evaluated at baseline (T0), 4 weeks post-intervention (T4) and 12-week follow-up (T12). The primary outcome was pain intensity. The secondary outcomes were degree of activation of MTrPs, surface electromyography (sEMG) levels and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I). RESULTS: Compared with the effect of BES, BES-SMFR treatment significantly decreased pain intensity and the degree of activation of MTrPs in the levator ani (p = 0.02) and obturator internus (p = 0.03), as well as the sEMG levels of the pre-test resting baseline and post-test resting baseline (all p < 0.01). The degree of activation of MTrPs in the piriformis and coccygeus (all p > 0.05) and the sEMG levels of the quick flicks and endurance contraction were not significantly different. The BES-SMFR treatment improved the PGI-I scale at T4 (p = 0.02) but not at T12 (p = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the addition of SMFR to BES treatment resulted in superior outcomes compared with those with BES alone in patients with MFPP. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Myofascial pelvic pain (MFPP) is a major contributor of female chronic pelvic pain. Myofascial release has been used commonly for better pain release; however, poor therapeutic effect due to poor patient compliance is common in clinical practice. Therefore, in future research, there is a need to investigate the effect of patient's self-myofascial release (SMFR) technique, which can eliminate the need for frequent office visits and improve patient compliance to some extent, in patients with MFPP.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lumbosacral dysfunctions and the resulting pain syndromes, such as low-back pain (LBP), are one of the most common musculoskeletal problems being faced by society around the world. So far, a contributory role of thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) dysfunction in some cases of LBP has been suggested. Research also confirms that muscle resting activity level in the TLF area is increased in people with LBP. Myofascial release (MFR) is a therapeutic option offered to patients with chronic low-back pain (CLBP). The therapy aims to improve flexibility and sliding between layers of soft tissue, and thus decrease muscle activity, reduce pain intensity, and improve functional performance. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess changes in resting activity of selected muscles within the TLF in a group of patients with CLBP immediately after a single MFR treatment and one month after the intervention. METHODS: A total of 113 patients with CLBP completed the study. Simple randomization was applied to assign subjects to study groups. The experimental group (n = 59) underwent a single session of MFR therapy. No therapeutic intervention was applied to the control group (n = 54). Surface electromyography was used to evaluate positive treatment effects in patients immediately after receiving the therapy (experimental group) and after one month (experimental and control group). RESULTS: A statistically reliable decrease in the activity of erector spinae (ES) and multifidus muscles (MF) was observed after a single session of MFR therapy. Effects of the treatment were present immediately after receiving the therapy and one month after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A single MFR treatment in patients with CLBP immediately reduces the resting activity levels of ES and MF. Results of measurements carried out one month after the treatment confirm that the therapeutic effects were maintained."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is limited evidence on the effects of myofascial release on fibromyalgia symptoms. This review aims to update the evidence on the effectiveness of myofascial release on pain, sleep, and quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. METHODS: The review was prepared following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete, and ProQuest Medical library were searched from their inception to April 1, 2021 for randomized or nonrandomized clinical trials published in English. Studies consisting of myofascial release alone or in combination with exercise as the intervention were included. The quality of the studies was evaluated using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0. RESULTS: Six studies, including a total of 279 participants, were included in the review. The meta-analysis showed a large significant effect of myofascial release on pain posttreatment (-0.81[95% CI = -1.15 to -0.47], p < 0.00001) and a moderate effect at 6 months post-treatment (-0.61, 95% CI = -0.95 to -0.28, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: The review demonstrated moderate evidence for the effect of therapist administered and self-myofascial release in improving pain, sleep subscales, and quality of life against sham and no treatment, respectively, in fibromyalgia syndrome patients. However, more high-quality randomized controlled trials with manual control group are required to be conducted at different geographical locations to generalize the findings.",
