      "abstract": "5-O-Protected and 1,2-acetonide-protected D-glucurono-6,3-lactone furanosides were converted into novel furano-glucuronamides through treatment with ammonia. Several O3 protections and O5-deprotection routes afford new primary gluconamide derivatives. However, attempted O3-benzylations of O5-protected intermediates led instead to silyl migration (from O5-TDBMS), competitive N-benzylation or reclosure to the lactone are observed as competing processes. This is not seen the using 5-O-PMB protection which the provides the method of choice for obtaining a fully protection-differentiated glucofuranamide. X-ray crystal structures of a fully-protected glucurono-6,3-lactone lactone and a glucuronamide derivatives are reported.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The neurotoxic effects of food additives used in energy drinks have been investigated since the 1900s but safety concerns are rising and reassurance via safety testing in animals is demanded by the public. Rigorous safety testing is performed for dose optimisation and duration of treatment and to detect the methods to assess changes in mood and behaviour. Hence, we studied the neurobehavioral effects of selected food additives used in energy drinks and their combination in rats when consumed in high doses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Young Sprague Dawley rats were divided into six groups. Group 1 was treated with the vehicle, group 2 was treated with 25 mg/kg p.o. caffeine, group 3 was treated with 5 mg/kg p.o. glucuronolactone, group 4 was treated with 8 mg/kg p.o. taurine, group 5 was treated with 84 mg/kg p.o. gluconolactone, and group 6 was treated with a combination of the three food additives. Neurobehavioral changes were evaluated on days 7, 14, and 21 using behavioural parameters. Neurobehavioral scoring and neurotransmitter estimation in rat brain tissue was performed on day 21. RESULTS: Significant changes were observed in the neurobehavioral parameters and neurobehavioural scoring in group 4 and group 6, compared with the control group (p<0.001). Furthermore, the significant decreases in neurotransmitter levels in the brains of rats that were treated with food additives indicated the neurotoxic effects of these substances. CONCLUSION: This study elaborated the neurobehavioral effects of selected food additives, namely glucuronolactone, taurine, and gluconolactone, when administered orally for 21 days in young rats. The highest toxic effects, including alterations in neurotransmitter levels, were observed in animals treated with a combination of food additives at high doses."

      "abstract": "Evidence-based medicine is advocated by WHO and adopted by developed countries for many years. In China, however, the selection of essential medicine and various medical insurance reimbursement schemes medicine is usually based on experts' experience of prescription practice which is under heavy critics resulting from the lack of related comparative efficacy and evidence-based research. The efficacy of Jian'ganle in prevention of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by antituberculotics was evaluated in this study by comparison with Hugan Pian, glucuronolactone and reduced glutathione. Evidence was provided for relevant sectors such as Ministry for Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China and National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China to select and renew the Essential Medicine List (EML), the new rural cooperative medical scheme in China (NRCMS) list or the reimbursement list of industrial injury insurance. A total of 189 patients with initial pulmonary tuberculosis were divided into four groups who took antituberculotics combined with Jian'ganle, Hugan Pian, glucuronolactone and reduced glutathione respectively. Their liver function profile including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), total protein (TP), albumin (A) and globulin (G) were detected at admission as baseline and after treatment. The Jian'ganle group was compared with the three others by chi-square tests. In an aspect of maintaining bilirubin indexes normal, Jian'ganle was more efficacious than glucuronolactone. And Jian'ganle had a little more efficacy than reduced glutathione to maintain protein indexes normal as well. And the therapeutic regimen of antituberculotics combined with Jian'ganle was the best in treating tuberculosis and preventing DILI at the same time. The study showed that among the four hepatinicas which demonstrated similar prevention of DILI caused by antituberculotics, Jian'ganle has more advantages over the three others to some extent, which provides a reliable basis for health sectors to select and renew the EML, NRCMS List or the reimbursement list of industrial injury insurance.",
