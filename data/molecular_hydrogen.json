      "abstract": "Molecular hydrogen (H2), recognized as the smallest gas molecule, is capable of permeating cellular membranes and diffusing throughout the body. Due to its high bioavailability, H2 is considered a therapeutic gas for the treatment of various diseases. The therapeutic efficacy of hydrogen is contingent upon factors such as the administration method, duration of contact with diseased tissue, and concentration at targeted sites. H2 can be administered exogenously and is also produced endogenously within the intestinal tract. A comprehensive understanding of its delivery mechanisms and modes of action is crucial for advancing hydrogen medicine. This review highlights H₂'s mechanisms of action, summarizes its administration methods, and explores advancements in treating intestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal ischemia-reperfusion, colorectal cancer). Additionally, its applications in managing other diseases are discussed. Finally, the challenges associated with its clinical application and potential solutions are explored. We propose that current delivery challenges faced by H2 can be effectively addressed through the use of nanoplatforms; furthermore, interactions between hydrogen and gut microbiota may provide insights into its mechanisms for treating intestinal diseases. Future research should explore the synergistic effects of H2 in conjunction with conventional therapies and develop personalized treatment plans to achieve precision medicine."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by bile duct destruction, cholestasis, and inflammation, often leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. While ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the standard treatment, some patients exhibit suboptimal responses, necessitating adjunctive therapies. Molecular hydrogen (H2), known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has shown potential in mitigating oxidative stress and immune dysregulation in autoimmune liver diseases. This case report evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of H2 capsules in managing PBC with elevated liver enzymes and immune dysregulation. CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old male with PBC, splenomegaly, and elevated IgG4 levels presented with acute cholestatic hepatitis. Laboratory tests revealed significantly elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) (279 U/l) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (183 U/l). Despite UDCA therapy, liver enzymes remained persistently high. On August 30, 2024, molecular hydrogen capsule therapy was introduced as adjunctive treatment. Over four months, AST and ALT levels declined to 95 U/l and 70 U/l, respectively, without adverse effects. Immune markers (KLRG-1, PD-1, and Tim3), previously reduced during PBC flares, normalized post-treatment. Imaging confirmed stable fibrosis, and IgG4 levels decreased, suggesting reduced autoimmune activity. The patient also reported improvements in fatigue and pruritus, enhancing overall quality of life. CONCLUSION: Molecular hydrogen capsules therapy may serve as a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for PBC, contributing to improved liver enzyme levels, immune regulation, and patient well-being. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and establish standardized treatment protocols in autoimmune liver diseases.",

      "abstract": "Inulin consumption and dihydrogen (H2) administration both exert antitumor effects on preclinical models as well as in clinical trials. As H2 is one of the major byproducts of inulin fermentation by bacterial species of the gut microbiota (GM), we hypothesized that H2 could mediate the antitumor effects of inulin. To provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis, we first determined the pattern of H2-exposure to which mice are subjected after inulin administration and developed an inhaled hydrogen therapy (H2T) protocol replicating this pattern. We then compared the effects on circulating immunity of a two-week daily inulin gavage with those of the corresponding H2T. We also compared the effects of inulin supplementation to those of the corresponding H2T on implanted melanoma growth and infiltration by T lymphocytes. Inulin and H2T induced a similar increase in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, both treatments similarly inhibited melanoma tumor growth. These results support a mechanism by which the H2 resulting from inulin fermentation by the GM diffuses across the intestinal barrier and stimulates the immunosurveillance responsible for the antitumor effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Subdural hematomas (SDH), often caused by head trauma, are serious with high mortality and long-term complications. Studies show that molecular hydrogen has neuroprotective effects, such as reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. It may also protect mitochondria, support cell function, and regulate immune responses, making it a promising new treatment option for SDH. However, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and create treatment guidelines. CASE REPORT: We present a 24-year-old man with SDH, along with a right-sided midline shift, uncal herniation, and dilated left pupil. Conventional treatments-craniectomy, hyperbaric oxygen, therapeutic hypothermia, and stem cell therapy-were essential for stabilizing his condition. In addition, we administered hydrogen capsules as a novel adjunct therapy, beginning daily treatment immediately upon admission. While recovery was primarily due to standard interventions, hydrogen therapy appeared to enhance immune markers, particularly Treg and plasma cells, with no adverse effects. This case indicates that hydrogen therapy may serve as a beneficial addition to established SDH management methods. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that molecular hydrogen therapy may be a helpful adjunct treatment for SDH with midline shift. Conventional therapies, including craniectomy, hyperbaric oxygen, therapeutic hypothermia, and stem cell therapy, were vital to the patient's recovery, but hydrogen therapy may have contributed by modulating immune responses, particularly Treg and plasma cell activity. While these findings are encouraging, further research is necessary to confirm hydrogen therapy's benefits and its role alongside traditional neurocritical care treatments.",

This aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of molecular hydrogen therapy in a patient with SLE-PAH with decompensated right-side heart failure. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 51-year-old female diagnosed with SLE-PAH in 2012. Despite treatment with vasodilator agents, her condition worsened following an episode of sepsis, leading to severe dyspnea and oxygen desaturation since 2018. In March 2024, molecular hydrogen therapy was introduced as an adjuvant treatment. The patient received daily hydrogen capsules, which resulted in an increased percentage of Tr1 cells, and a decreased percentage of Treg cell subsets, B cell subsets, marginal cell, and plasma cell. Her clinical symptoms stabilized, and no adverse effects or complications were observed.

However, prolonged use of these treatments is often associated with significant side effects, underscoring the need for adjunctive therapies that improve disease outcomes while minimizing adverse effects. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has demonstrated potential as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. This report discusses a case of SLE with cardiac complications, evaluating the therapeutic impact of molecular hydrogen therapy on fatigue, immune modulation, and cardiac function. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old female with SLE and acute decompensated heart failure initially received steroids and immunomodulators for disease management. Subsequently, molecular hydrogen therapy was introduced as an adjuvant treatment. Over several months, her cardiac function showed notable improvement, evidenced by reductions in anti-dsDNA and anti-Ro52 antibody levels, and Pro-BNP levels, as well as favorable shifts in T and B cell subsets. Additionally, the patient experienced a significant reduction in fatigue. She successfully tapered off steroids while maintaining disease stability with ongoing molecular hydrogen therapy. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the potential of molecular hydrogen therapy as an adjuvant treatment in SLE, with observed benefits in immune modulation and fatigue reduction. Further studies are warranted to elucidate its therapeutic role and applicability in autoimmune diseases.",

Eighty-one patients undergoing standard HD were classified into 3 groups [Group A (n = 25, 30.9%): fatigue with activity reduction-subgroups A1: chronic persistent fatigue (n = 11), A2: fatigue only on dialysis days (n = 14); Group B: fatigue without activity reduction (n = 24, 29.6%); Group C (n = 32, 39.5%): no fatigue], and their changes in fatigue, body composition, and metabolic profiles were studied following 12 months of E-HD. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics among the groups. Over the 12 months after E-HD initiation, fatigue in Group A significantly decreased, while no changes in Group-B and C. Bio-impedance analysis revealed no significant changes in A1, but significant reductions in body fat and increases in skeletal muscle mass were observed despite no significant weight change in A2. Enrichment analysis suggested significant differences in metabolic pathways such as fatty acid metabolism, citric acid cycle, and glycolysis between Groups A and C at baseline, and these differences were mitigated by E-HD. E-HD could suppress dialysis-related fatigue, through possible involvement of altered energy metabolism of patients. E-HD may represent a new paradigm for uremia treatment beyond traditional solute removal-based dialysis therapies.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is responsible for the pathogenesis of many diseases, and antioxidants are commonly included in their treatment protocols. Over the past two decades, numerous biomedical reports have revealed the therapeutic benefits of molecular hydrogen (H2) in relieving oxidation-related diseases. H2 has been found to have selective antioxidant properties against the most dangerous oxidants (hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite). H2 demonstrates numerous biologically therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-stress, anti-apoptotic, anti-allergic effects, signaling molecule functions, regulation of redox balance, modulation of antioxidant enzyme gene expression, improvement of blood vessel function, down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulation of energy metabolism, and protection of the nervous system. Experimental and clinical studies have shown the potential use of hydrogen nutrition therapy for ameliorating various diseases, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic disorders, as well as obesity, gastrointestinal disorders, and brain and nervous system disorders. The administration methods of hydrogen include inhalation, hydrogen-rich water, hydrogen-rich saline, hydrogen-rich eye drops, and hydrogen-rich bathing. Hydrogen nutritional therapy can be applied to different diseases, and it offers a natural alternative to chemical and radiation therapies. This review covers the different administration methods and the latest experimental and clinical research on the potential applications of H2 in nutritional therapy for different diseases."

Adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent bilateral common carotid artery stenosis to induce VaD and were subsequently assigned to three groups: VaD, VaD with hydrogen-rich water treatment (VaD + H2), and Sham controls. Behavioral assessments using open field and novel object recognition tests revealed that VaD mice exhibited anxiety-deficient behavior and memory impairment, both of which were reversed by H2 treatment. Histological examinations showed pyknotic neuronal morphologies and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the VaD hippocampus, whereas H2 administration mitigated these alterations. Furthermore, VaD-induced downregulation of BCL2 was reversed in the VaD + H2 group, in parallel with increased IL-4 expression. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that VaD disrupted T regulatory cell homeostasis by significantly increasing their proportion, an effect reversed by H2 treatment, thereby restoring immunological balance. Transcriptomic evaluations confirmed that VaD suppressed key neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory genes, while H2 treatment restored or enhanced their expression. Collectively, these findings highlight the neuroprotective and immuno-modulatory potential of molecular hydrogen, suggesting that H2 supplementation may promote neuronal resilience, modulate T cell differentiation, and support cognitive recovery in vascular dementia."

Molecular hydrogen (H2), due to its unique physical and chemical properties, provides a number of benefits for alleviating oxidative stress.

CAP, being a modulated source of ROS and RNS, also assists MSCs by altering the cellular redox balance, thus facilitating cellular adaptation, migration, and differentiation. H2 and CAP in conjunction with each other assist in establishing an ambience favorable for promoting MSCs' survival and growth abilities, and reduce the healing time in various pathways such as wound, neuroprotection, and ischemia. Besides these concerns, this review also covers the best administration routes and doses of H2 and CAP together with MSCs in therapy. This study informs on a novel dual method aimed at improving the outcome of MSC therapy while adding several molecular targets and relevant clinical uses concerning these therapies. Research of the future has to deal with bettering these protocols so that the therapeutic benefits can be maximized without long-term implications for clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Chronic itch which is primarily associated with dermatologic, systemic, or metabolic disorders is often refractory to most current antipruritic medications, thus highlighting the need for improved therapies. Oxidative damage is a novel determinant of spinal pruriceptive sensitization and synaptic plasticity. The resolution of oxidative insult by molecular hydrogen has been manifested. Herein, we strikingly report that both hydrogen gas (2 %) inhalation and hydrogen-rich saline (5 mL/kg, intraperitoneal) injection prevent and alleviate persistent dermatitis-induced itch, diabetic itch and cholestatic itch. Hydrogen therapy reverses the decrease of spinal SIRT1 expression and antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx and CAT) activity after dermatitis, diabetes and cholestasis. Furthermore, hydrogen reduces spinal ROS generation, oxidation products (MDA, 8-OHdG and 3-NT) accumulation, β-catenin acetylation and dendritic spine density in persistent itch models. Spinal SIRT1 inhibition eliminates antipruritic and antioxidative effects of hydrogen, while SIRT1 agonism attenuates chronic itch phenotype, spinal β-catenin acetylation and mitochondrial damage. β-catenin inhibitors are effective against chronic itch via reducing β-catenin acetylation, blocking ERK phosphorylation and elevating antioxidant enzymes activity. Hydrogen treatment suppressed dermatitis and cholestasis mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in vitro. Additionally, hydrogen impairs cholestasis-induced the enhancement of cerebral functional connectivity between the right primary cingulate cortex and bilateral sensorimotor cortex, as well as bilateral striatum. Taken together, this study uncovers that molecular hydrogen protects against chronic pruritus and spinal pruriceptive sensitization by reducing oxidative damage via up-regulation of SIRT1-dependent β-catenin deacetylation in mice, implying a promising strategy in translational development for itch control.",

This case report presents the possible therapeutic benefits of molecular hydrogen capsule treatment in enhancing renal function and alleviating chronic fatigue in an elderly female with coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) complicated by nephropathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of adjunctive hydrogen therapy in an elderly patient with multiple chronic comorbidities. CASE REPORT: An 89-year-old female with a history of CAD s/p who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) over 40 years ago, type 2 DM complicated by nephropathy, and SLE was admitted with recurrent cellulitis at the saphenous vein donor site from her previous CABG. Despite antibiotic treatment, wound healing remained limited. In January 2023, the patient initiated adjuvant treatment with molecular hydrogen capsules. Following the introduction of hydrogen therapy, her renal function improved, evidenced by a reduction in serum creatinine levels. Chronic fatigue, assessed using the Taiwan Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI-T), showed significant improvement. Immunological evaluation revealed a series of changes, suggesting that immune modulation may be the mechanism underlying the observed clinical benefits. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen therapy was associated with improved renal function and a reduced chronic fatigue in this elderly patient with multiple comorbidities, including CAD, DM, and SLE. The case underscores the potential therapeutic role of hydrogen therapy in immune modulation and the management of chronic conditions, suggesting the need for further investigation in clinical settings.",

A method for calculating Raman scattering cross sections is formulated that is valid below the ionization threshold and in the region containing resonances, which explicitly accounts for all bound and dissociative vibrational levels of the bound intermediate electronic states and approximately accounts for the ionization continuum. A representative set of cross sections is presented for incident photon energies below 15 eV and compared with existing results in the literature where possible.

The effect of accounting for the intermediate ionization continuum is investigated. Local thermal equilibrium cross sections are calculated for Rayleigh and Raman scattering.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Neuroinflammation, a low-grade chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, is linked to age-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as senile depression and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have explored controlling neuroinflammation as a novel treatment strategy. Molecular hydrogen shows anti-inflammatory effects. However, its impacts on neuroinflammation and age-related neuropsychiatric disorders remain unelucidated. We investigated molecular hydrogen's effects on microglial activation, neuroinflammation, depressive-like behavior, and short-term cognitive decline in senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. METHODS: Six-week-old SAMP8 or senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice received hydrogen-rich jelly (HRJ) or placebo jelly (PJ) from six weeks of age for 26-28 weeks. Depressive-like behavior was assessed using tail suspension and forced swimming tests, while cognitive function was evaluated using the Y-maze and object recognition tests. Brain tissues were used for immunohistochemical studies or to measure pro-inflammatory cytokine levels via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: HRJ intake reduced immobility time in both tail suspension and forced swimming tests and enhanced visual cognitive and spatial working memory in SAMP8 mice. Additionally, HRJ intake suppressed the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), Iba1, and cleaved caspase 3 expression levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Furthermore, HRJ intake significantly lowered IL-6 levels in brain tissues of SAMP8 mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that molecular hydrogen treatment may regulate neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia and improve depressive-like behavior and short-term cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice.",

      "abstract": "Background: Persistent inflammation over time can cause gradual harm to the body. Molecular hydrogen has the potential to specifically counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduce disease severity, and enhance overall health. Investigations of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of oral solid hydrogen capsules (OSHCs) are currently limited, prompting our examination of the beneficial effects of OSHCs. Subsequently, we conducted a clinical study to assess the impact of OSHCs supplementation on individuals with chronic inflammation. Materials and methods: Initially, we evaluated the oxidative reduction potential (ORP) properties of the OSHCs solution by comparing it to hydrogen-rich water (HRW) and calcium hydride (CaH2) treated water. In our outpatient department, stable patients with chronic illnesses who were treated with varying doses of OSHCs were randomized into low-, medium-, and high-dose groups for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes included changes in the serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations after four weeks of OSHCs consumption. Secondary outcomes included changes in the Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwan (BFI-T) fatigue scale, Control Status Scale for Diabetes (CSSD70) scores, and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28). Results: Compared to HRW and CaH2, OSHCs demonstrated a prolonged reduction in ORP for 60 minutes in vitro and enabled a regulated release of hydrogen over 24 hours. A total of 30 participants, with 10 in each dosage (low/medium/high) group, completed the study. The average ESR120 significantly decreased from the first week to the fourth week, with a noticeable dose effect (low-dose group, p = 0.494; high-dose group, p = 0.016). Overall, the average CRP concentration showed a distinct decreasing trend after four weeks of OSHCs administration (w0 vs. w4, p = 0.077). The average DAS28 score demonstrated a significant decrease following OSHCs treatment. Furthermore, there were improvements in the BFI-T and CSSD70 scores. Conclusion: OSHCs supplementation may exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on individuals with chronic inflammation. However, further clinical studies could be investigated to explore the potential therapeutic effects of OSHCs.",

      "abstract": "Extracorporeal circulation (ECC) is frequently implemented in a vast array of modalities such as hemodialysis, cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and others. Patients receiving any such therapy are frequently encumbered with chronic inflammation, which is inherently accompanied by oxidative stress. However, ECC treatments themselves are also responsible for sustaining or promoting inflammation. On these grounds, an in vitro study was designed to investigate the therapeutic potential of molecular hydrogen (H2) against pro-inflammatory agents in ECC settings. Five miniature ECMO circuits and a small vial (Control) were primed with heparinized blood from healthy adult donors (n = 7). Three of the ECMO systems were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), out of which one was additionally treated with an H2 gas mixture. After 6 h, samples were drawn for the assessment of specific biomarkers (MCP-1, MPO, MDA-a, TRX1, and IL-6). Preliminary results indicate a progressive oxidative and inflammatory response between the six systems. Circulation has triggered inflammation and blood trauma, but the staggering influence of LPS in this outcome is indisputable. Accordingly, hydrogen's remedial potential becomes immediately apparent as biomarker concentrations tend to be lower in the H2-handled circuit. Future research should have distinct objectives (e.g., dosage/duration/cycle of hydrogen administration) in order to ascertain the optimal protocol for patient treatment."

      "abstract": "AIM: The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of hydrogen in preventing and treating psychiatric symptoms, particularly depressed mood and loss of interest, and to explore its underlying mechanisms. A mouse model exhibiting inflammation-derived depressive symptoms was used for the investigation. METHODS: Institute of Cancer Research mice were subjected to a 7-day intervention of either 30% hydrogen or 40 g per day of air via jelly intake. On the final day, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was intraperitoneally administered at 5 mg/kg to induce inflammation-related depressive symptoms. Behavioral and biochemical assessments were conducted 24 h post-LPS administration. RESULTS: Following LPS administration, a decrease in spontaneous behavior was observed; however, this effect was mitigated in the group treated with hydrogen. The social interaction test revealed a significant reduction in interactions with unfamiliar mice in the LPS-treated group, whereas the hydrogen-treated group exhibited no such decrease. No significant changes were noted in the forced-swim test for either group. Additionally, the administration of LPS in the hydrogen group did not result in a decrease in zonula occludens-1, a biochemical marker associated with barrier function at the cerebrovascular barrier and expressed in tight junctions. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen administration demonstrated a preventive effect against the LPS-induced loss of interest, suggesting a potential role in symptom prevention. However, it did not exhibit a suppressive effect on depressive symptoms in this particular model. These findings highlight the nuanced impact of hydrogen in the context of inflammation-induced psychiatric symptoms, indicating potential avenues for further exploration and research."

Due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, and anti-fatigue properties, molecular hydrogen (H2) is potentially a novel therapeutic nutrient for patients with coronavirus acute disease 2019 (COVID-19). We determined the efficacy and safety profile of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) to reduce the risk of COVID-19 progression. Methods: We also conducted a phase 3, triple-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate treatment with HRW initiated within 5 days after the onset of signs or symptoms in primary care patients with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Participants were randomised to receive HRW or placebo twice daily for 21 days. The incidence of clinical worsening and adverse events were the primary endpoints. Results: A total of 675 participants were followed up to day 30. HRW was not superior to placebo in preventing clinical worsening at day 14: in H2 group, 46.1% in the H2 group, 43.5% in the placebo group, hazard ratio 1.09, 90% confidence interval [0.90-1.31]. One death was reported at day 30 in the H2 group and two in the placebo group at day 30. Adverse events were reported in 91 (27%) and 89 (26.2%) participants, respectively. Conclusions: HRW taken twice daily from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms for 21 days did not reduce clinical worsening."

      "abstract": "The gut-brain axis mediates the interaction pathway between microbiota and opioid addiction. In recent years, many studies have shown that molecular hydrogen has therapeutic and preventive effects on various diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether molecular hydrogen could serve as pharmacological intervention agent to reduce risks of reinstatement of opioid seeking and explore the mechanism of gut microbiota base on animal experiments and human studies. Morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was constructed to establish acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement stage, and the potential impact of H2 on the behaviors related to morphine-induced drug extinction was determined using both free accessible and confined CPP extinction paradigms. The effects of morphine on microbial diversity and composition of microbiota, as well as the subsequent changes after H2 intervention, were assessed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) in mice serum were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Meanwhile, we also conducted molecular hydrogen intervention and gut microbiota testing in opioid-addicted individuals. Our results revealed that molecular hydrogen could enhance the extinction of morphine-related behavior, reducing morphine reinstatement. Gut microbes may be a potential mechanism behind the therapeutic effects of molecular hydrogen on morphine addiction. Additionally, molecular hydrogen improved symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as gut microbial features, in individuals with opioid addiction. This study supports molecular hydrogen as a novel and effective intervention for morphine-induced addiction and reveals the mechanism of gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "Diet and lifestyle choices, notably the Western-type diet, are implicated in oxidative stress and inflammation, factors that elevate the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In contrast, the Mediterranean of diet, rich in antioxidants, appears to have protective effects against these risks. This article highlights the dual role of diet in generating molecular hydrogen ( H 2  ) in the gut, and H 2  's subsequent influence on the pathophysiology and prevention of CVD and T2DM. Dietary fiber, flavonoids, and probiotics contribute to the production of liters of H 2  in the gut, functioning as antioxidants to neutralize free radicals and dampen inflammation. In the last two decades, mounting evidence has demonstrated that both endogenously produced and exogenously administered H 2  , whether via inhalation or H 2  -rich water (HRW), have potent anti-inflammatory effects across a wide range of biochemical and pathophysiological processes. Recent studies indicate that H 2  can neutralize hydroxyl and nitrosyl radicals, acting as a cellular antioxidant, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammation-leading to a significant decline in CVDs and metabolic diseases. Clinical and experimental research support the therapeutic potential of H 2  interventions such as HRW in managing CVDs and metabolic diseases. However, larger studies are necessary to verify the role of H 2  therapy in the management of these chronic diseases."

This is due to a problem with the philosophy behind the development of modern medical treatments. In this paper, we will introduce \"smart medicine\" with a substance that can solve all the problems of central nervous system drugs. The substance is the smallest diatomic molecule, the hydrogen molecule. Due to their size, hydrogen molecules can easily penetrate the cell membrane and enter the brain. In the midbrain of Parkinson's disease patients, hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction cause a chain reaction of oxidation of dopamine, but hydrogen entering the midbrain can convert the hydroxyl radicals into water molecules and inhibit the oxidation of dopamine. In this paper, we focus on the etiology of neurological diseases, especially Parkinson's disease, and present a case in which hydrogen inhalation improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as body bending and hand tremor. And we confidently state that if Michael J. Fox encountered \"smart medicine\" that could be realized with molecular hydrogen, he would not be a \"lucky man\" but a \"super-lucky man.\"",

      "abstract": "While drug therapy plays a crucial role in cancer treatment, many anticancer drugs, particularly cytotoxic and molecular-targeted drugs, cause severe side effects, which often limit the dosage of these drugs. Efforts have been made to alleviate these side effects by developing derivatives, analogues, and liposome formulations of existing anticancer drugs and by combining anticancer drugs with substances that reduce side effects. However, these approaches have not been sufficiently effective in reducing side effects. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has shown promise in this regard. It directly reduces reactive oxygen species, which have very strong oxidative capacity, and indirectly exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects by regulating gene expression. Its clinical application in various diseases has been expanded worldwide. Although H2 has been reported to reduce the side effects of anticancer drugs in animal studies and clinical trials, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Our comprehensive literature review revealed that H2 protects against tissue injuries induced by cisplatin, oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, and gefitinib. The underlying mechanisms involve reductions in oxidative stress and inflammation. H2 itself exhibits anticancer activity. Therefore, the combination of H2 and anticancer drugs has the potential to reduce the side effects of anticancer drugs and enhance their anticancer activities. This is an exciting prospect for future cancer treatments."

A recent study reveals a positive interaction between molecular hydrogen (H2) and a heme oxygenase (HO-1) enzyme inducer, cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP), in the inhibition of neuropathic pain provoked by nerve injury. Nevertheless, the efficacy of CoPP co-administered with hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on the allodynia and emotional disorders related to paclitaxel (PTX) administration has not yet been assessed. Using male C57BL/6 mice injected with PTX, we examined the effects of the co-administration of low doses of CoPP and HRW on mechanical and thermal allodynia and anxiodepressive-like behaviors triggered by PTX. Moreover, the impact of this combined treatment on the oxidative stress and inflammation caused by PTX in the amygdala (AMG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were studied. Our results indicated that the antiallodynic actions of the co-administration of CoPP plus HRW are more rapid and higher than those given by each of them when independently administered. This combination inhibited anxiodepressive-like behaviors, the up-regulation of the inflammasome NLRP3 and 4-hydroxynonenal, as well as the high mRNA levels of some inflammatory mediators. This combination also increased the expression of NRF2, HO-1, superoxide dismutase 1, glutathione S-transferase mu 1, and/or the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit and decreased the protein levels of BACH1 in the DRG and/or AMG. Thus, it shows a positive interaction among HO-1 and H2 systems in controlling PTX-induced neuropathy by modulating inflammation and activating the antioxidant system. This study recommends the co-administration of CoPP plus HRW as an effective treatment for PTX-provoked neuropathy and its linked emotive deficits."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a proliferative retinal vascular disease occurring in the retina of premature infants and is the main cause of childhood blindness. Nowadays anti-VEGF and retinal photocoagulation are mainstream treatments for ROP, but they develop a variety of complications. Hydrogen (H2) is widely considered as a useful neuroprotective and antioxidative therapeutic method for hypoxic-ischemic disease without toxic effects. However, whether H2 provides physiological angiogenesis promotion, neovascularization suppression and glial protection in the progression of ROP is largely unknown.This study aims to investigate the effects of H2 on retinal angiogenesis, neovascularization and neuroglial dysfunction in the retinas of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice. METHODS: In this study, mice that were seven days old and either wild-type (WT) or Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) were exposed to 75% oxygen for 5 days and then returned to normal air conditions. Different stages of hydrogen gas (H2) inhalation were administered. Vascular obliteration, neovascularization, and blood vessel leakage were analyzed and compared. To count the number of neovascularization endothelial nuclei, routine HE staining of retinal sections was conducted. Immunohistochemistry was performed using DyLight 594 labeled GSL I-isolectin B4 (IB4), as well as primary antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Iba-1. Western blots were used to measure the expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Notch1, Dll4, and HIF-1α. Additionally, the expression of target genes such as NQO1, HO-1, Notch1, Hey1, Hey2, and Dll4 was measured. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with H2 under hypoxia were used as an in vitro model. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression of Nrf2, Notch/Dll4, and the target genes. The expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed using immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Our results indicate that 3-4% H2 does not disturb retinal physiological angiogenesis, but ameliorates vaso-obliteration and neovascularization in OIR mice. Moreover, H2 prevents the decreased density and reverses the morphologic and functional changes in retinal astrocytes caused by oxygen-induced injury. In addition, H2 inhalation reduces microglial activation, especially in the area of neovascularization in OIR mice. H2 plays a protective role in vascular regeneration by promoting Nrf2 activation and suppressing the Dll4-induced Notch signaling pathway in vivo. Also, H2 promotes the proliferation of HUVECs under hypoxia by negatively regulating the Dll4/Notch pathway and reducing ROS levels through Nrf2 pathway aligning with our findings in vivo.Moreover, the retinal oxygen-sensing mechanisms (HIF-1α/VEGF) are also involved in hydrogen-mediated retinal revascularization and neovascularization suppression. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results indicate that H2 could be a promising therapeutic agent for POR treatment and that its beneficial effect in human ROP might involve the activation of the Nrf2-Notch axis as well as HIF-1α/VEGF pathways.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a key role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) development and progression, inducing kidney cell damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, effective therapeutic interventions to slow down CKD advancement are currently lacking. The multifaceted pharmacological effects of molecular hydrogen (H2) have made it a promising therapeutic avenue. H2 is capable of capturing harmful •OH and ONOO- while maintaining the crucial reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in cellular signaling. The NRF2-KEAP1 system, which manages cell redox balance, could be used to treat CKD. H2 activates this pathway, fortifying antioxidant defenses and scavenging ROS to counteract oxidative stress. H2 can improve NRF2 signaling by using the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and indirectly activate NRF2-KEAP1 in mitochondria. Additionally, H2 modulates NF-κB activity by regulating cellular redox status, inhibiting MAPK pathways, and maintaining Trx levels. Treatment with H2 also attenuates HIF signaling by neutralizing ROS while indirectly bolstering HIF-1α function. Furthermore, H2 affects FOXO factors and enhances the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Despite the encouraging results of bench studies, clinical trials are still limited and require further investigation. The focus of this review is on hydrogen's role in treating renal diseases, with a specific focus on oxidative stress and redox signaling regulation, and it discusses its potential clinical applications.",

AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combined inhalation of NO and H2 (iNO/iH2) in patients with respiratory manifestations of PS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 34 patients with PS (11 men/23 women, 60.0±11.7 years) were included in the prospective open-label controlled study in parallel groups: the main group (n=17) received iNO/iH2 for 90 minutes once a day for 10 days (concentration of NO 60 ppm, H2<4% in the gas mixture), the control group (n=17) didn't receive inhalations. The period from the confirmation of COVID-19 to the start of the study was 641.8±230.5 days. The groups did not differ in the baseline parameters. The clinical symptoms (from the self-observation diary and mMRC questionnaires, \"dyspnea language\"), FAS, HADS, SF-36 scores, 6-minute walk test, the blood serum parameters of oxidative stress, the dynamics of the microcirculation in the eye bulbar conjunctiva were evaluated. The individual dose of iNO has chosen during a 15-minute test (the positive dynamics of the microcirculation have indicated that the dose was selected correctly). RESULTS: The decrease the symptoms severity, such as dyspnea, cough, fatigue and palpitations (p<0.005), the increase in SF-36 questionnaire scores (p=0.006) and a reducing of FAS score (p=0.001), as well as the anxiety component of HADS (p=0.02) were revealed at the end of treatment in the main group compared to the control group. We observed an improvement in distance walked (p=0.01) and the values SpO2 (p=0.04) in 6-minute walk test, the increase in the volumetric blood flow velocity in venules (p<0.001), and the date in oxidative damage (p<0.001) and antioxidant activity (p=0.03) parameters in the blood serum.

Methods The rd1 mice were divided randomly into control and H2 intervention groups. Mice from other groups received H2 intervention in three modes, two modes of the hydrogen gas (HG) and one model of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS). At 14 days post born (P14) and P21, various indicators were detected in all mice, including eletroretinogram (ERG), fundus phography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and retinal immunotaining of microglia cells' marker, Iba1. Results The ERG amplitude in mice from the control and H2 intervention groups showed no statistical differences (p > 0.05). At P14 and P21, no significant difference in the distance from the retinal pigment epithelium to the outer plexiform layer on OCT from mice of the above two groups was found (p > 0.05). The thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in mice at P14 and P21 showed no statistical differences between the control group and the H2 intervention group (p > 0.05). In the aspect of the number of Iba1-positive cells, we did not found any significant differences between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion Different forms of H2 intervention (hydrogen-rich saline and hydrogen gas) had no obvious effects on the course of retinal degeneration in rd1 mice. The specific mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration in the hereditary RP mouse model may be different, requiring different medical interventions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Exercise-induced oxidative stress affects multiple neurophysiological processes, diminishing the exercise performance. Hydrogen (H2) can selectively reduce excessive free radicals, but studies observed its \"dual effects\" on exercise-induced oxidative stress, that is, increasing or decreasing the oxidative stress. Therefore, we here conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the influence of H2 on exercise-induced oxidative stress in healthy adults. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of publications across five databases. The following keywords were used for search strategy: [\"hydrogen\"[Mesh] or \"molecular hydrogen\" or \"hydrogen rich water\" or \"hydrogen-rich water\" or \"hydrogen rich saline\"] and [\"Oxidative Stress\"[Mesh] or \"Antioxidative Stress\" or \"Oxidative Damage\" or \"Oxidative Injury\" or \"Oxidative Cleavage\"] and [\"randomized controlled trial\"[Mesh] or \"randomized\" or \"RCT\"]. We included trials reporting the effects of H2 on exercise-induced oxidative stress and potential antioxidant capacity post-exercise in healthy adults. Additionally, subgroup analyses were conducted to explore how various elements of the intervention design affected those outcomes. RESULTS: Six studies, encompassing seven experiments with a total of 76 participants, were included in our analysis. Among these studies, hydrogen-rich water, hydrogen bathing, and hydrogen-rich gas were three forms used in H2 administration. The H2 was applied in different timing, including before, during, or after exercise only, both before and after exercise, and repeatedly over days. Single-dose, multi-dose within 1 day and/or multiple-dose over days were implemented. It was observed that compared to placebo, the effects of H2 on oxidative stress (diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites, d-ROMs) was not significant (SMD = -0.01, 95%CI-0.42 to 0.39, p = 0.94). However, H2 induced greater improvement in antioxidant potential capacity (Biological Antioxidant Potential, BAP) (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.54, p = 0.03) as compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses revealed that H2 supplementation showed greater improvement (SMD = 0.52, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.87, p = 0.02) in the antioxidant potential capacity of intermittent exercises than continuous exercise. CONCLUSION: H2 supplementation can help enhance antioxidant potential capacity in healthy adults, especially in intermittent exercise, but not directly diminish the levels of exercise-induced oxidative stress. Future studies with more rigorous design are needed to examine and confirm these findings.

      "abstract": "Gas signaling molecules, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), have been shown to have cancer therapeutic potential, pointing to a new direction for cancer treatment. In recent years, a series of studies have confirmed that hydrogen (H2), a weakly reductive gas, also has therapeutic effects on various cancers and can mitigate oxidative stress caused by radiation and chemotherapy, reducing tissue damage and immunosuppression to improve prognosis. Meanwhile, H2 also has immunomodulatory effects, inhibiting T cell exhaustion and enhancing T cell anti-tumor function. It is worth noting that human intestinal flora can produce large amounts of H2 daily, which becomes a natural barrier to maintaining the body's resistance to diseases such as tumors. Although the potential anti-tumor mechanisms of H2 are still to be investigated, previous studies have shown that H2 can selectively scavenge highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit various ROS-dependent signaling pathways in cancer cells, thus inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. The ROS scavenging ability of H2 may also be the underlying mechanism of its immunomodulatory function. In this paper, we review the significance of H2 produced by intestinal flora on the immune homeostasis of the body, the role of H2 in cancer therapy and the underlying mechanisms, and the specific application of H2 to provide new ideas for the comprehensive treatment of cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Aging and excessive fat intake may additively induce dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and intestinal inflammatory damage. Here, we analyzed microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal injury in high-fat diet-loaded senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP8). Additionally, we examined whether treatment with molecular hydrogen could improve the intestinal environment. METHODS: SAMP8 and SAMR1 (control) mice were first fed a normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 wk (n = 10 each group). Subsequently, HFD was supplemented with a placebo jelly or hydrogen-rich jelly (HRJ) for 4 wk. After treatment, isolated small intestinal tissues were used for hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence staining, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. Furthermore, we analyzed alterations in the microbiota composition in cecal feces using 16S rRNA gene analysis for microbiota profiling. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student's t tests or one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparisons. RESULT: HFD feeding reduced the expression of caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the small intestine of SAMP8. HRJ treatment improved the reduction in CDX2 and BrdU and enhanced MDA levels. We performed a sequence analysis of the gut microbiota at the genus level and identified 283 different bacterial genera from the 30 samples analyzed in the study. Among them, Parvibacter positively correlated with both HFD intake and aging, whereas 10 bacteria, including Anaerofustis, Anaerosporobacter, Butyricicoccus, and Ruminococcus were negatively correlated with both HFD and aging. HRJ treatment increased Lactinobactor and decreased Akkermansia, Gracilibacter, and Marvinbryantia abundance. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that treatment with molecular hydrogen may affect microbiota profiling and suppress intestinal injury in HFD-loaded SAMP8.",

High-cell-density manufacturing processes are the most commonly used to produce vaccine antigens and protein drugs. However, the cellular stress response in large-scale cell culture may directly affect host cell growth and metabolism, reducing antigen production and increasing production costs. This study provided a novel strategy of the antioxidant auxiliary system (AAS) to supply molecular hydrogen (H2) into the cell culture media via proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis. Integrated with a high-density cell bioreactor, the AAS aims to alleviate cellular stress response and increase viral vaccine production. In the results, the AAS stably maintained H2 concentration in media even in the high-air exposure tiding cell bioreactor. H2 treatment was shown safe to cell culture and effectively alleviated oxidative stress. In two established virus cultures models, bovine epidemic fever virus (BEFV) and porcine circovirus virus type 2 (PCV-2), were employed to verify the efficacy of AAS. The virus yield was increased by 3.7 and 2.5 folds in BEFV and PCV-2 respectively. In conclusion, the AAS-connected bioreactor effectively alleviated cellular oxidative stress and enhanced virus production in high-density cell culture.",

Positive indications have been found in major disease areas including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, central nervous system disorders, infections and many more. The available administration methods, which can pose challenges due to hydrogens' explosive hazards and low solubility, as well as possible future innovative technologies to mitigate these challenges, have been reviewed. Finally, an elaboration to discuss the findings is included with the aim of addressing the following questions: will hydrogen gas be a new drug substance in future clinical practice?

      "abstract": "Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas which displays non-toxic features at high concentrations. H2 can alleviate oxidative damage, reduce inflammatory reactions and inhibit apoptosis cascades, thereby inducing protective and repairing effects on cells. H2 can be transported into the body in the form of H2 gas, hydrogen-rich water (HRW), hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) or H2 produced by intestinal bacteria. Accumulating evidence suggest that H2 is protective against multiple ophthalmic diseases, including cataracts, dry eye disease, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other fields. In particular, H2 has been tested in the treatment of dry eye disease and corneal endothelial injury in clinical practice. This medical gas has brought hope to patients suffering from blindness. Although H2 has demonstrated promising therapeutic potentials and broad application prospects, further large-scale studies involving more patients are still needed to determine its optimal application mode and dosage. In this paper, we have reviewed the basic characteristics of H2, and its therapeutic effects in ophthalmic diseases. We also focus on the latest progress in the administration approaches and mechanisms underlying these benefits."

      "abstract": "As diabetes rates surge globally, there is a corresponding rise in the number of patients suffering from diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a common complication of diabetes. DKD is a significant contributor to chronic kidney disease, often leading to end-stage renal failure. However, the effectiveness of current medical treatments for DKD leaves much to be desired. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is an antioxidant that selectively reduces hydroxyl radicals, a reactive oxygen species with a very potent oxidative capacity. Recent studies have demonstrated that H2 not only possesses antioxidant properties but also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, regulates cell lethality, and modulates signal transduction. Consequently, it is now being utilized in clinical applications. Many factors contribute to the onset and progression of DKD, with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation being strongly implicated. Recent preclinical and clinical trials reported that substances with antioxidant properties may slow the progression of DKD. Hence, we undertook a comprehensive review of the literature focusing on animal models and human clinical trials where H2 demonstrated effectiveness against a variety of renal diseases. The collective evidence from this literature review, along with our previous findings, suggests that H2 may have therapeutic benefits for patients with DKD by enhancing mitochondrial function. To substantiate these findings, future large-scale clinical studies are needed."

Protons (H+) and molecular hydrogen (H2) interact in the cell and are essential in a wide variety of processes. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects of H2 have been studied in numerous experimental and clinical studies. Experimental data indicate that H2 is an antitumor agent in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). In vivo H2 inhalation could suppress the growth of GBM tumors, thereby extending the survival of mice with GBM. The sphere-forming ability of glioma cells was suppressed by hydrogen treatment. In addition, H2 treatment also suppressed the migration, invasion, and colony-forming ability of glioma cells. Proton therapy and proton beam radiotherapy offer some advantages over other modern conformal photon-based therapies when used in the treatment of central nervous system malignancies."

We studied the effect of adjuvant therapy with hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) content and platelet mitochondrial bioenergetics in patients with NAFLD. A total of 30 patients with NAFLD and 15 healthy volunteers were included in this clinical trial. A total of 17 patients (H2 group) drank water three × 330 mL/day with tablets producing HRW (>4 mg/L H2) for 8 weeks, and 13 patients (P group) drank water with placebo tablets producing CO2. The concentration of CoQ10-TOTAL was determined by the HPLC method, the parameter of oxidative stress, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), by the spectrophotometric method, and mitochondrial bioenergetics in platelets isolated from whole blood by high-resolution respirometry. The patients with NAFLD had lower concentrations of CoQ10-TOTAL in the blood, plasma, and platelets vs. the control group. Mitochondrial CI-linked LEAK respiration was higher, and CI-linked oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and CII-linked electron transfer (ET) capacities were lower vs. the control group. Plasma TBARS concentrations were higher in the H2 group. After 8 weeks of adjuvant therapy with HRW, the concentration of CoQ10 in platelets increased, plasma TBARS decreased, and the efficiency of OXPHOS improved, while in the P group, the changes were non-significant. Long-term supplementation with HRW could be a promising strategy for the acceleration of health recovery in patients with NAFLD. The application of H2 appears to be a new treatment strategy for targeted therapy of mitochondrial disorders. Additional and longer-term studies are needed to confirm and elucidate the exact mechanisms of the mitochondria-targeted effects of H2 therapy in patients with NAFLD."

METHODS: A 1.5-T single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess the tissue concentrations of relevant metabolites. RESULTS: The mean glutamate and glutamate-plus-glutamine levels at the posterior cingulate gyrus decreased significantly during the study; this was accompanied by a significant drop in GABA levels at left prefrontal white matter, and glutathione levels at anterior cingulate gyrus. No changes in the brain metabolites were found in the comparable group of overweight individuals (n = 4, 2 women; age: 41.0 ±13.9, BMI 26.8 ±1.3 kg/m2) followed-up in the past without this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We showed a possible hydrogen-driven upregulation of neurotransmitters involved in appetite stimulation leading to hunger suppression and weight loss. Further studies analyzing appetite-controlling metabolic pathways affected by H2 would require monitoring of additional biomarkers of satiation and satiety during different feeding regimens."

At the same time, functional pathway analysis helped identify functional pathways at the protein level. Then, bioinformatics on mRNA sequencing data were conducted between sepsis and normal mouse models. Differential expressional genes with the closest relationship to disease status and development were identified through module correlation analysis. Then, common biomarkers in proteomics and transcriptomics were extracted as target biomarkers. Through analyzing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), colocalization analysis on Apoa2 and sepsis phenotype was conducted by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Then, two-sample and drug-target, syndrome Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were all conducted using the Twosample R package. For protein level, protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) of the target biomarker were also included in MR. Animal experiments helped validate these results. As a result, Apoa2 protein or mRNA was identified as a target biomarker for H2 with a protective, causal relationship with sepsis. HDL and type 2 diabetes were proven to possess causal relationships with sepsis. The agitation and inhibition of Apoa2 were indicated to influence sepsis and related syndromes. In conclusion, we first proposed Apoa2 as a target for H2 treatment.",

Recently, molecular hydrogen (H2 gas) has also been applied to cardiac surgery due to its ability to reduce oxidative stress. We evaluated the potential effect of H2 application on the kidney in an in vivo model of simulated heart transplantation. Pigs underwent cardiac surgery within 3 h while connected to extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and subsequent 60 min of spontaneous reperfusion of the heart. We used two experimental groups: T-pigs after transplantation and TH-pigs after transplantation treated with 4% H2 mixed with air during inhalation of anesthesia and throughout oxygenation of blood in ECC. The levels of creatinine, urea and phosphorus were measured in plasma. Renal tissue samples were analyzed by Western blot method for protein levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD1). After cardiac surgery, selected plasma biomarkers were elevated. However, H2 therapy was followed by the normalization of all these parameters. Our results suggest activation of Nrf2/Keap1 pathway as well as increased SOD1 protein expression in the group treated with H2. The administration of H2 had a protective effect on the kidneys of pigs after cardiac surgery, especially in terms of normalization of plasma biomarkers to control levels.",

      "abstract": "Side streams of the dairy industry are a suitable nutrient source for cultivating microorganisms, producing enzymes, and high-value chemical compounds. The heterotrophic Escherichia coli and chemolithoautotroph Ralstonia eutropha are of major biotechnological interest. R. eutropha is a model organism for producing O2-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenases (Hyds) (biocatalysts), and E. coli has found widespread use as an expression platform for producing recombinant proteins, molecular hydrogen (H2), and other valuable products. Aiming at developing suitable cultivation media from side streams of the dairy industry, the pre-treatment (filtration, dilution, and pH adjustment) of cheese (sweet) whey (SW) and curd (acid) whey (AW), with and without the use of ß-glucosidase, has been performed. Growth parameters (oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), pH changes, specific growth rate, biomass formation) of E. coli BW25113 and R. eutropha H16 type strains were monitored during cultivation on filtered and non-filtered SW and AW at 37 °C, pH 7.5 and 30 °C, pH 7.0, respectively. Along with microbial growth, measurements of pH and ORP indicated good fermentative growth. Compared to growth on fructose-nitrogen minimal salt medium (control), a maximum cell yield (OD600 4.0) and H2-oxidizing Hyd activity were achieved in the stationary growth phase for R. eutropha. Hyd-3-dependent H2 production by E. coli utilizing whey as a growth substrate was demonstrated. Moreover, good biomass production and prolonged H2 yields of ~ 5 mmol/L and cumulative H2 ~ 94 mL g/L dry whey (DW) (ß-glucosidase-treated) were observed during the cultivation of the engineered E. coli strain. These results open new avenues for effective whey treatment using thermostable β-glucosidase and confirm whey as an economically viable commodity for biomass and biocatalyst production. KEY POINTS: • Archaeal thermostable β-glucosidase isolated from the metagenome of a hydrothermal spring was used for lactose hydrolysis in whey. • Hydrogenase enzyme activity was induced during the growth of Ralstonia eutropha H16 on whey. • Enhanced biomass and H2 production was shown in a genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli.",

      "abstract": "Age-related diseases represent the largest threat to public health. Aging is a degenerative, systemic, multifactorial and progressive process, coupled with progressive loss of function and eventually leading to high mortality rates. Excessive levels of both pro- and anti-oxidant species qualify as oxidative stress (OS) and result in damage to molecules and cells. OS plays a crucial role in the development of age-related diseases. In fact, damage due to oxidation depends strongly on the inherited or acquired defects of the redox-mediated enzymes. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has recently been reported to function as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of several oxidative stress and aging-related diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer and osteoporosis. Additionally, H2 promotes healthy aging, increases the number of good germs in the intestine that produce more intestinal hydrogen and reduces oxidative stress through its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. This review focuses on the therapeutic role of H2 in the treatment of neurological diseases. This review manuscript would be useful in knowing the role of H2 in the redox mechanisms for promoting healthful longevity."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of molecular hydrogen on the local therapy of a II degree burn wound with the intensification of collagen fibrillogenesis in the skin. We analyzed the involvement of mast cells (MCs) in the regeneration of the collagen fibers of the connective tissue using water with a high content of molecular hydrogen and in a therapeutic ointment for the cell wounds. Thermal burns led to an increase in the skin MC population, accompanied by a systemic rearrangement of the extracellular matrix. The use of molecular hydrogen for the treatment of burn wounds stimulated the regeneration processes by activating the formation of the fibrous component of the dermis, accelerating wound healing. Thus, the intensification of collagen fibrillogenesis was comparable to the effects of a therapeutic ointment. The remodeling of the extracellular matrix correlated with a decrease in the area of damaged skin. Skin regeneration induced by the activation of the secretory activity of MCs may be one of the possible points of implementation of the biological effects of molecular hydrogen in the treatment of burn wounds. Thus, the positive effects of molecular hydrogen on skin repair can be used in clinical practice to increase the effectiveness of therapy after thermal exposure."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite progress in developing wound care strategies, there is currently no treatment that promotes the self-tissue repair capabilities. H2 has been shown to effectively protect cells and tissues from oxidative and inflammatory damage. While comprehensive effects and how H2 functions in wound healing remains unknown, especially for the link between H2 and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) activation. METHODS: Here, we established a cutaneous aseptic wound model and applied a high concentration of H2 (66% H2) in a treatment chamber. Molecular mechanisms and the effects of healing were evaluated by gene functional enrichment analysis, digital spatial profiler analysis, blood perfusion/oxygen detection assay, in vitro tube formation assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescent staining, non-targeted metabonomic analysis, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscope, and live-cell imaging. RESULTS: We revealed that a high concentration of H2 (66% H2) greatly increased the healing rate (3 times higher than the control group) on day 11 post-wounding. The effect was not dependent on O2 or anti-reactive oxygen species functions. Histological and cellular experiments proved the fast re-epithelialization in the H2 group. ECM components early (3 days post-wounding) deposition were found in the H2 group of the proximal wound, especially for the dermal col-I, epidermal col-III, and dermis-epidermis-junction col-XVII. H2 accelerated early autologous EpSCs proliferation (1-2 days in advance) and then differentiation into myoepithelial cells. These epidermal myoepithelial cells could further contribute to ECM deposition. Other beneficial outcomes include sustained moist healing, greater vascularization, less T-helper-1 and T-helper-17 cell-related systemic inflammation, and better tissue remodelling. CONCLUSION: We have discovered a novel pattern of wound healing induced by molecular hydrogen treatment. This is the first time to reveal the direct link between H2 and ECM deposition and EpSCs activation. These H2-induced multiple advantages in healing may be related to the enhancement of cell viability in various cells and the maintenance of mitochondrial functions at a basic level in the biological processes of life."

Erythrocytes are subjected to oxidative stress in pathologies of the cardiovascular system, which is the cause of a violation of the gas transport function of blood and microcirculation. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effects of H2 inhalation on the functional states of red blood cells (RBCs) in chronic heart failure (CHF) in rats. The markers of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant capacity, electrophoretic mobility of erythrocytes (EPM), aggregation, levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-DPG), hematological parameters were estimated in RBCs. An increase in EPM and a decrease in the level of aggregation were observed in groups with multiple and single H2 application. The orientation of lipoperoxidation processes in erythrocytes was combined with the dynamics of changes in oxidative processes in blood plasma, it was observed with both single and multiple exposures, although the severity of the changes was greater with multiple H2 inhalations. Probably, the antioxidant effects of molecular hydrogen mediate its metabolic action. Based on these data, we conclude the use of H2 improves microcirculation and oxygen transport function of blood and can be effective in the treatment of CHF."

Zebrafish scales offer an innovative model in which new therapeutic approaches against secondary osteoporosis are tested. Scale bone loss obtained by prednisolone (PN) treatment is characterized by increased osteoclast activity and decreased osteoblast activity highlighted with bone enzymatic assays. We used this read-out system to test the therapeutic effects of hydrogen-rich water (HRW), an innovative antioxidant approach. HRW prevented osteoclast activation and bone loss in PN-treated fish scales, as verified by both biochemical and histochemical tartrate-resistant alkaline phosphatase assays. On the other hand, HRW treatment did not prevent PN-dependent osteoblast suppression, as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity. Moreover, HRW treatment did not facilitate the reparation of resorption lacunae induced in scales by PN. Our study highlighted a specific effect of HRW on adult osteoclast activity but not in osteoblasts, introducing an intriguing new antioxidant preventive approach against osteoporosis."

Studies indicate that molecular hydrogen (H2), with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may be a promising strategy to alleviate fatigue and improve aerobic capacity. However, such effects have not been comprehensively characterized. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the effects of in taking H2 on fatigue and aerobic capacity in healthy adults. METHODS: The search was conducted in August 2022 in five databases. Studies with randomized controlled or crossover designs that investigated the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), and endurance performance were selected. The data (mean ± standard deviation and sample size) were extracted from the included studies and were converted into the standardized mean difference (SMD). Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Subgroup analysis was used to analyze potential sources of heterogeneity due to intervention period, training status, and type of exercise. RESULTS: Seventeen publications (19 studies) consisting of 402 participants were included. The pooled effect sizes of H2 on RPE (SMDpooled = -0.38, 95%CI -0.65 to -0.11, p = 0.006, I 2 = 33.6%, p = 0.149) and blood lactate (SMDpooled = -0.42, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.12, p = 0.006, I 2 = 35.6%, p = 0.114) were small yet significant with low heterogeneity. The pooled effect sizes of H2 on VO2max and VO2peak (SMDpooled = 0.09, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.29, p = 0.333, I 2 = 0%, p = 0.998) and endurance performance (SMDpooled = 0.01, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.25, p = 0.946, I 2 = 0%, p > 0.999) were not significant and trivial without heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis revealed that the effects of H2 on fatigue were impacted significantly by the training status (i.e., untrained and trained), period of H2 implementation, and exercise types (i.e., continuous and intermittent exercises). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides moderate evidence that H2 supplementation alleviates fatigue but does not enhance aerobic capacity in healthy adults.

Molecular hydrogen can scavenge intracellular hydroxyl radicals, acting as an antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory agent. We seek to assess the capability of molecular hydrogen to ameliorate brain damage induced by electromagnetic radiation. METHODS: NEMP (nuclear electromagnetic pulse), a subset of electromagnetic pulse with high voltage value that could cause severe brain injury, was applied to this study. Male wild-type rats were divided into four groups: the control group, the H2 (Molecular hydrogen) group, the NEMP group and the NEMP+H2 group. Rats in the H2 group and the NEMP+H2 group were fed with saturated hydrogen-rich water from 3 days before NEMP exposure (electromagnetic field intensity 400 kV/m, rising edge 20 ns and pulse width 200 ns) to the day of sacrifice. One day after exposure, animal behavior experiments were performed, and samples for transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis were collected. Seven days after exposure, histopathological experiments were conducted. RESULTS: The data from the elevated plus maze and the open field test showed that NEMP exposure elicited anxiety-like behavior in rats, which could be alleviated by H2 treatment. Histopathological results manifested that NEMP exposure-induced injuries of the neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala could be attenuated by H2 treatment. Transcriptomic results revealed that NEMP exposure had a profound effect on microtubule structure in the brain. And the combined analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics showed that H2 has a significant impact on the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, synaptic vesicle cycle and synapse etc. Moreover, it was indicated that the glutathione metabolic pathway played a vital role in the NEMP exposure-induced damage and the protective activity of H2. CONCLUSIONS: H2 is identified as a potent agent against NEMP exposure-induced brain damage and has the potential to be a promising electromagnetic radiation protectant.",

Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been reported to be a promising adjunctive therapy for cancer treatment, having the capability to induce anti-proliferative, anti-oxidative, pro-apoptotic and anti-tumoural effects. This review summarises the findings from various articles on the mechanism, treatment outcomes, and overall effectiveness of H2 therapy on cancer management. METHODS: Using Cochrane, PubMed, and Google Scholar as the search engines, full-text articles in the scope of the study, written in English and within 10 years of publication were selected. RESULTS: Out of the 677 articles, 27 articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria, where data was compiled into a table, outlining the general characteristics and findings. Throughout the different forms of H2 administration, study design and types of cancers reported, outcomes were found to be consistent. CONCLUSION: From our analysis, H2 plays a promising therapeutic role as an independent therapy as well as an adjuvant in combination therapy, resulting in an overall improvement in survivability, quality of life, blood parameters, and tumour reduction. Although more comprehensive research is needed, given the promising outcomes, H2 is worth considering for use as a complement to current cancer therapy.",

Due to its excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, hydrogen therapy via different routes of administration exhibits great therapeutic potential for a wide range of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, depression, anxiety, traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. This paper reviews the routes for hydrogen administration, the effects of hydrogen on the previously mentioned brain disorders, and the primary mechanism underlying hydrogen's neuroprotection. Finally, we discuss hydrogen therapy's remaining issues and challenges in brain disorders. We conclude that understanding the exact molecular target, finding novel routes, and determining the optimal dosage for hydrogen administration is critical for future studies and applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a cognitive dysfunction caused by sepsis. Hyperphosphorylated tau is considered to play a significant role in the progression of neurodegenerative disease and also contributes to cognitive dysfunction in septic mice. Molecular hydrogen (H2) plays an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory role, and plays a protective role in septic mice. This study explored the possible effects of H2 on cognition and tau phosphorylation in a mouse model of SAE. METHODS: The model of sepsis was established in C57BL/6J male mice by cecal ligation and puncture surgery. Mice treated with 2 % H2 inhalation for 60 min at 1 h and 6 h after surgery, respectively. HY-15769, the inhibitor of Tau Tubulin Kinase 1 (TTBK1), was injected 1 h before the surgery. The 7-day survival rates of the mice were recorded. Cognitive behavior was tested with both novel object recognition and the Y-maze novelty arm recognition on day 7 after surgery. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the histological damage in CA1 region of hippocampus. The expression of inflammatory factors in hippocampus was assessed by Elisa. Western blotting was adopted to determine the tau phosphorylation levels at AT8 epitopes (pSer202 and pThr205) and T22 epitopes (neurofibrillary tangle protein oligomer), and the GSK3β phosphorylation levels (Tyr216), as well as p-Ser422 and TTBK1 levels in the hippocampus. The number of dendritic spine and mushroom type of dendritic spines in the hippocampus were assessed by Golgi staining. RESULTS: The survival rate, visual and spatial learning ability, and memory ability were improved in septic mice treated with H2. After H2 treatment, the density of dendritic spine, mushroom type of dendritic spine, and the number of normal hippocampal neurons were progressively elevated. H2 decreased the levels of phosphorylated tau protein, tau oligomer and TTBK1, as well as the phosphorylation of tau key kinase. Furthermore, the injection of HY-15769 (a TTBK1 inhibitor) protected SAE through the similar way. CONCLUSION: The protective effect of H2 on cognitive dysfunction induced by SAE may be achieved by inhibiting tau phosphorylation, which is perhaps related with the inhibition of TTBK1.",

A growing amount of evidence has indicated potential connections between gut microbiota and mental disorders induced by METH and associations with neural and metabolic pathways. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between fecal microbial alterations and neuropsychiatric diseases in METH addictions. Thus, mental disorders and gut microbial alterations were analyzed by self-rating depression (SDS) and anxiety (SAS) scales and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that increased SDS and SAS indices and decreased alpha diversity indicated more serious mental disorders and lower bacterial diversity in METH users than in the age-matched healthy control group. The gut microbial composition in female METH users was also significantly altered, with reductions in hydrogen-producing bacteria, including Bacteroides and Roseburia. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is spontaneously produced by intestinal bacteria in the process of anaerobic metabolism, which is the main pathway for H2 production in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that hydrogen intervention can significantly improve neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that hydrogen intervention, including drinking and inhaling, significantly alleviated mental disorders induced by METH abuse, and the inhalation of hydrogen also altered gut microbiota profiles in the METH abusers. These results suggest that hydrogen intervention has potential therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mental disorders in METH abusers.",

The feces of the mice were collected for 16 S rDNA analysis 24 h after the models were established, and the serum and brain tissue of the mice were collected for nontargeted metabolomics analysis. AIM: Destruction of the intestinal microbiota is a risk factor for sepsis and subsequent organ dysfunction, and up to 70% of severely ill patients with sepsis exhibit varying degrees of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). The pathogenesis of SAE remains unclear. We aimed to explore the changes in gut microbiota in SAE and the regulatory mechanism of molecular hydrogen. RESULTS: Molecular hydrogen treatment significantly improved the functional outcome of SAE and downregulated inflammatory reactions in both the brain and the gut. In addition, molecular hydrogen treatment improved gut microbiota dysbiosis and partially amended metabolic disorder after SAE. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular hydrogen treatment promotes functional outcomes after SAE in mice, which may be attributable to increasing beneficial bacteria, repressing harmful bacteria, and metabolic disorder, and reducing inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Medical use of hydrogen gas (H2) has been given increasing attention over the past 15 years with numerous clinical trials for a variety of indications. The biological activity of H2 includes antioxidant properties and thereby the ability to neutralize damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Administration of hydrogen as a medical gas is limited by the poor water solubility and by the flammability of H2 in air. Therefore, nanocarriers have been investigated for safer and more efficient administration of hydrogen. Silicon particles are suggested for oral administration with the ability to undergo a redox reaction with water to produce H2in vivo. The purpose of this work was to investigate the hydrogen generating abilities of silicon particles synthesized by centrifugal chemical vapor deposition (cCVD). High hydrogen generation rates up to 1310 ml/g at physiological pH 7.4 (82 % yield) were observed. An in vitro model of oral administration showed that pretreatment in artificial gastric juice did not affect hydrogen generation. Thus, the cCVD silicon particles seem to be suitable for in vivo hydrogen generation. A surface carbon coating or addition of surfactants or albumin hindered hydrogen generation. The addition of egg white reduced hydrogen generation but did not block it.",

Inhalation of H2 caused an increase in ATP concentration in both research groups, but was more pronounced after repeated inhalation. The content of 2,3-DPG increased after repeated exposure to H2. The increase in metabolic activity under the effect of H2 was accompanied by a decrease in malondialdehyde concentration and an increase in catalase activity. Thus, the application of H2 in chronic heart failure reduced oxidative stress and improved metabolism of erythrocytes, which contributes to improvement of microcirculation.

The study aimed to investigate the potential role of molecular hydrogen as a component of anesthesia in surgical treatment with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of acquired valve defects on the functional state of red blood cells (RBC) and functional indicators of cardiac activity. This clinical trial was conducted with 20 patients referring to the Specialized Cardiosurgical Clinical Hospital, Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation, who underwent elective surgery with CPB. Twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to two groups. First group included 12 patients (research group) who received H2 at a concentration of 1.5-2.0% through a facemask using a breathing circuit of the ventilator together with anesthesia immediately after tracheal intubation and throughout the operation. Second group (control group) included 12 patients who were not given H2. Blood samples were withdrawn from peripheral veins and radial artery at four stages: immediately after the introduction of anesthesia (stage 1), before the start of CPB (stage 2), immediately after its termination (stage 3) and 24 hours after the operation (the early postoperative period) (stage 4). An increase in electrophoretic mobility, an increase in the metabolism of red blood cells, and a decrease in the aggregation of red blood cells relative to the corresponding indicators of the control group were observed in the research group. Patients in the research group had a decrease in oxidative stress manifestations most pronounced one day after the operation. There was a statistically significant difference between the indicators of myocardial contractile function in the research and control group on the 1st and 3rd days after surgery. H2 inhalation leads to improvement of functional state of red blood cells, which is accompanied by a more favorable course of the early postoperative period. These data show the presence of protective properties of molecular hydrogen.",

      "abstract": "Currently, there is a lot of public interest in naturally occurring substances with medicinal properties that are minimally toxic, readily available and have an impact on health. Over the past decade, molecular hydrogen has gained the attention of both preclinical and clinical researchers. The death of pyramidal neurons in especially the CA1 area of the hippocampus, increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, neuroinflammation, amyloid accumulation, tau protein dysfunction, brain atrophy, cognitive deficits and dementia are considered an integral part of the phenomena occurring during brain neurodegeneration after ischemia. This review focuses on assessing the current state of knowledge about the neuroprotective effects of molecular hydrogen following ischemic brain injury. Recent studies in animal models of focal or global cerebral ischemia and cerebral ischemia in humans suggest that hydrogen has pleiotropic neuroprotective properties. One potential mechanism explaining some of the general health benefits of using hydrogen is that it may prevent aging-related changes in cellular proteins such as amyloid and tau protein. We also present evidence that, following ischemia, hydrogen improves cognitive and neurological deficits and prevents or delays the onset of neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The available evidence suggests that molecular hydrogen has neuroprotective properties and may be a new therapeutic agent in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as neurodegeneration following cerebral ischemia with progressive dementia. We also present the experimental and clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of hydrogen use after cerebral ischemia. The therapeutic benefits of gas therapy open up new promising directions in breaking the translational barrier in the treatment of ischemic stroke.",

However, the wide bandgap requires the use of UV photons to harness its potential. A convenient way to appease such a limitation is the doping of the lattice with foreign atoms which, in turn, introduce localized states (defects) within the bandgap. Such localized states make the material optically active in the visible range and reduce the energy required to initiate photo-driven charge separation events. In this work, we employed a green synthetic procedure to achieve a high level of doping and have demonstrated how the thermal treatment during synthesis is crucial to select specific the microscopic (molecular) nature of the defect and, ultimately, the type of chemistry (reduction versus oxidation) that the material is able to perform. We found that low-temperature treatments produce material with higher efficiency in the water photosplitting reaction. This constitutes a further step in the establishment of N-doped ZnO as a photocatalyst for artificial photosynthesis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been considered a potential therapeutic target in many cancers. Therefore, we sought to assess the potential effect of H2 on colorectal cancer (CRC) in this study. METHODS: The effect of H2 on the proliferation and apoptosis of RKO, SW480, and HCT116 CRC cell lines was assayed by CCK-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays. The effect of H2 on tumor growth was observed in xenograft implantation models (inhalation of 67% hydrogen two hours per day). Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to examine the expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, AKT, pAKT, and SCD1 in CRC cell lines and xenograft mouse models. The expression of SCD1 in 491 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded CRC specimens was investigated with immunochemistry. The relationship between SCD1 status and clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes was determined. RESULTS: Hydrogen treatment suppressed the proliferation of CRC cell lines independent of apoptosis, and the cell lines showed different responses to different doses of H2. Hydrogen also elicited a potent antitumor effect to reduce CRC tumor volume and weight in vivo. Western blot and IHC staining demonstrated that H2 inhibits CRC cell proliferation by decreasing pAKT/SCD1 levels, and the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by H2 was reversed by the AKT activator SC79. IHC showed that SCD1 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in normal epithelial tissues (70.3% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.02) and was correlated with a more advanced TNM stage (III vs. I + II; 75.9% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.02), lymph node metastasis (with vs. without; 75.9% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.02), and patients without a family history of CRC (78.7% vs. 62.1%, p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that high concentrations of H2 exert an inhibitory effect on CRC by inhibiting the pAKT/SCD1 pathway. Further studies are warranted for clinical evaluation of H2 as SCD1 inhibitor to target CRC.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disorder that is characterized by fatigue that persists for more than 6 months, weakness, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction. There are multiple possible etiologies for ME/CFS, among which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in abnormal energy metabolism. The potential of many substances for the treatment of ME/CFS has been examined; however, satisfactory outcomes have not yet been achieved. The development of new substances for curative, not symptomatic, treatments is desired. Molecular hydrogen (H2) ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction by scavenging hydroxyl radicals, the most potent oxidant among reactive oxygen species. Animal experiments and clinical trials reported that H2 exerted ameliorative effects on acute and chronic fatigue. Therefore, we conducted a literature review on the mechanism by which H2 improves acute and chronic fatigue in animals and healthy people and showed that the attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction by H2 may be involved in the ameliorative effects. Although further clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and mechanism of H2 gas in ME/CFS, our literature review suggested that H2 gas may be an effective medical gas for the treatment of ME/CFS."

      "abstract": "Ageing is a physiological process of progressive decline in the organism function over time. It affects every organ in the body and is a significant risk for chronic diseases. Molecular hydrogen has therapeutic and preventive effects on various organs. It has antioxidative properties as it directly neutralizes hydroxyl radicals and reduces peroxynitrite level. It also activates Nrf2 and HO-1, which regulate many antioxidant enzymes and proteasomes. Through its antioxidative effect, hydrogen maintains genomic stability, mitigates cellular senescence, and takes part in histone modification, telomere maintenance, and proteostasis. In addition, hydrogen may prevent inflammation and regulate the nutrient-sensing mTOR system, autophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondria, which are all factors related to ageing. Hydrogen can also be used for prevention and treatment of various ageing-related diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cancer. This paper reviews the basic research and recent application of hydrogen in order to support hydrogen use in medicine for ageing prevention and ageing-related disease therapy.",

However, molecular data to support therapeutic functions attributed to the biological activities of H2 remain elusive. Here, using transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches coupled with biochemistry and micro-CT technics, we evaluated the effect of long-term (6 months) and daily use of H2 on liver function. Rats exposed 2 h daily to H2 either by drinking HRW (H2 dissolved in H2O) or by breathing 4% H2 gas showed reduced lipogenesis and enhanced lipolysis in the liver, which was associated with apparent loss of visceral fat and brown adipose tissue together with a reduced level of serum lipids. Both transcripts and metabolites enriched in H2-treated rats revealed alteration of amino acid metabolism pathways and activation of purine nucleotides and carbohydrate biosynthesis pathways. Analysis of the interaction network of genes and metabolites and correlation tests revealed that NADP is the central regulator of H2 induced metabolic alterations in the liver, which was further confirmed by an increase in the level of components of metabolic pathways that require NADP as substrate. Evidence of immune response regulation activity was also observed in response to exposure to H2. This work is the first to provide metabolomic and transcriptomic data to uncover molecular targets for the effect of prolonged molecular hydrogen treatment on liver metabolism.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 14 days of H2 inhalation on the respiratory and physical fitness status of acute post-COVID-19 patients. This randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study included 26 males (44 ± 17 years) and 24 females (38 ± 12 years), who performed a 6-min walking test (6 MWT) and pulmonary function test, specifically forced vital capacity (FVC) and expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1). Symptomatic participants were recruited between 21 and 33 days after a positive polymerase chain reaction test. The experiment consisted of H2/placebo inhalation, 2 × 60 min/day for 14 days. Results showed that H2 therapy, compared with placebo, significantly increased 6 MWT distance by 64 ± 39 m, FVC by 0.19 ± 0.24 L, and, in FEV1, by 0.11 ± 0.28 L (all p ≤ 0.025). In conclusion, H2 inhalation had beneficial health effects in terms of improved physical and respiratory function in acute post-COVID-19 patients. Therefore, H2 inhalation may represent a safe, effective approach for accelerating early function restoration in post-COVID-19 patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical condition, and inflammation and apoptosis play essential roles. Molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Our previous work has shown that 42% H2 can improve TBI. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that inhalation of hydrogen (42% H2, 21% O2, balanced nitrogen) for 1 h per day can improve TBI-induced ALI. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Except for the sham group (group S), rats were subjected to a fluid percussion injury (FPI) and the H2 treatment group were given inhaled hydrogen for 1 h per day. We evaluated the lung function, pyroptosis and apoptosis at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. RESULTS: Compared with group S, the rats in the TBI group (group T) showed obvious pulmonary edema after a TBI. Inhalation of high-concentration hydrogen significantly improved the rats. During this process, rats had some tendency to heal on their own, and H2 also accelerated the self-healing process. Lung injury scores, oxygenation index and pulmonary edema were consistent. Compared with group S, the pyroptosis-related proteins Caspase-1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) and Gasdermin-D (GSDM-D) in the lung tissues of the rats in group T were significantly increased after a TBI. In the H2 treatment group (group H), these proteins were significantly decreased. The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 were significantly increased after TBI while in group H were significantly decreased. At the same time, cleaved caspase-3 and BCL-2/Bax were also changed after H2 treatment. These demonstrates the powerful ameliorating effect of H2 on pyroptosis, apoptosis and systemic inflammation. However, rats also had tendency to heal on their own, and H2 also accelerated the self-healing process at the same time. CONCLUSIONS: H2 improves TBI-ALI, and the mechanism may be due to the decrease of both pyroptosis and apoptosis and the alleviation of inflammation. These findings provide a reference and evidence for the use of H2 in TBI-ALI patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).",

      "abstract": "Despite being trialed in other regions of the world, the use of molecular hydrogen (H2) for enhanced plant growth and the postharvest storage of crops has yet to be widely accepted in the UK. The evidence that the treatment of plants and plant products with H2 alleviates plant stress and slows crop senescence continues to grow. Many of these effects appear to be mediated by the alteration of the antioxidant capacity of plant cells. Some effects seem to involve heme oxygenase, whilst the reduction in the prosthetic group Fe3+ is also suggested as a mechanism. Although it is difficult to use as a gaseous treatment in a field setting, the use of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has the potential to be of significant benefit to agricultural practices. However, the use of H2 in agriculture will only be adopted if the benefits outweigh the production and application costs. HRW is safe and relatively easy to use. If H2 gas or HRW are utilized in other countries for agricultural purposes, it is tempting to suggest that they could also be widely used in the UK in the future, particularly for postharvest storage, thus reducing food waste."

Inflammatory storms play an important role in the development of the COVID-19. A large number of studies have confirmed that hydrogen has a therapeutic effect on many diseases via inhibiting excessive inflammatory cells and factors. Recently, a study led by the Academician Zhong Nanshan in China on the treatment of the patients with the COVID-19 by inhalation of a mixed gas composed of hydrogen and oxygen has attracted widespread international attention and hydrogen therapy has also been included in a new treatment plan for the COVID-19 in China.

      "abstract": "COVID-19 is a widespread global pandemic with nearly 185 million confirmed cases and about four million deaths. It is caused by an infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which primarily affects the alveolar type II pneumocytes. The infection induces pathological responses including increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. This situation results in impaired gas exchange, hypoxia, and other sequelae that lead to multisystem organ failure and death. As summarized in this article, many interventions and therapeutics have been proposed and investigated to combat the viral infection-induced inflammation and oxidative stress that contributes to the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, these methods have not significantly improved treatment outcomes. This may partly be attributable to their inability at restoring redox and inflammatory homeostasis, for which molecular hydrogen (H2), an emerging novel medical gas, may complement. Herein, we systematically review the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic mechanisms of H2. Its small molecular size and nonpolarity allow H2 to rapidly diffuse through cell membranes and penetrate cellular organelles. H2 has been demonstrated to suppress NF-κB inflammatory signaling and induce the Nrf2/Keap1 antioxidant pathway, as well as to improve mitochondrial function and enhance cellular bioenergetics. Many preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of H2 in varying diseases, including COVID-19. However, the exact mechanisms, primary modes of action, and its true clinical effects remain to be delineated and verified. Accordingly, additional mechanistic and clinical research into this novel medical gas to combat COVID-19 complications is warranted.",

This study investigated the effect of molecular hydrogen (H2), an antioxidant, on CDH pathology induced by nitrofen. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control, CDH, and CDH + hydrogen-rich water (HW). Pregnant dams of CDH + HW pups were orally administered HW from embryonic day 10 until parturition. Gasometric evaluation and histological, immunohistochemical, and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed. Gasometric results (pH, pO2, and pCO2 levels) were better in the CDH + HW group than in the CDH group. The CDH + HW group showed amelioration of alveolarization and pulmonary artery remodeling compared with the CDH group. Oxidative stress (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine-positive-cell score) in the pulmonary arteries and mRNA levels of protein-containing pulmonary surfactant that protects against pulmonary collapse (surfactant protein A) were significantly attenuated in the CDH + HW group compared with the CDH group. Overall, prenatal H2 administration improved respiratory function by attenuating lung morphology and pulmonary artery thickening in CDH rat models. Thus, H2 administration in pregnant women with diagnosed fetal CDH might be a novel antenatal intervention strategy to reduce newborn mortality due to CDH.",

      "abstract": "While many antitumor drugs have yielded unsatisfactory therapeutic results, drugs are one of the most prevalent therapeutic measures for the treatment of cancer. The development of cancer largely results from mutations in nuclear DNA, as well as from those in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Molecular hydrogen (H2), an inert molecule, can scavenge hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which are known to be the strongest oxidizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body that causes these DNA mutations. It has been reported that H2 has no side effects, unlike conventional antitumor drugs, and that it is effective against many diseases caused by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Recently, there has been an increasing number of papers on the efficacy of H2 against cancer and its effects in mitigating the side effects of cancer treatment. In this review, we demonstrate the efficacy and safety of H2 as a novel antitumor agent and show that its mechanisms may not only involve the direct scavenging of ·OH, but also other indirect biological defense mechanisms via the regulation of gene expression.",

      "abstract": "H2 gas, usually in the form of H2-saturated water, could play a useful role in improving many aspects of plant growth and productivity, including resistance to stress tolerance and improved post-harvest durability. Therefore, molecular hydrogen delivery systems should be considered as a valuable addition within agricultural practice. Agriculture and food security are both impacted by plant stresses, whether that is directly from human impact or through climate change. A continuously increasing human population and rising food consumption means that there is need to search for agriculturally useful and environment friendly strategies to ensure future food security. Molecular hydrogen (H2) research has gained momentum in plant and agricultural science owing to its multifaceted and diverse roles in plants. H2 application can mitigate against a range of stresses, including salinity, heavy metals and drought. Therefore, knowing how endogenous, or exogenously applied, H2 enhances the growth and tolerance against numerous plant stresses will enhance our understanding of how H2 may be useful for future to agriculture and horticulture. In this review, recent progress and future implication of H2 in agriculture is highlighted, focusing on how H2 impacts on plant cell function and how it can be applied for better plant performance. Although the exact molecular action of H2 in plants remains elusive, this safe and easy to apply treatment should have a future in agricultural practice.",

      "abstract": "Colitis is an inflammatory condition of the bowels associated with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever. Its etiology is multifactorial but related to the overproduction of inflammatory and oxidative mediators. There is currently no cure for this disease, and drugs used to manage it often have deleterious side effects. H2 is recognized as having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may qualify it as a novel therapeutic for colitis. We induced an acute model of colitis in mice by administering dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days. Mice were divided into five groups (n=6); normal, colitis, H2-treated colitis, sulfasalazine-treated colitis, and H2 plus sulfasalazine-treated colitis. From days three to ten, mice were given H2, sulfasalazine, or both. H2 was administered via dissolving a hydrogen-generating tablet in water to make hydrogen-rich water (HRW), which was ingested ad libitum and via oral gavage (200 μL). The Disease Activity Index (DAI), histological changes, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were assessed. HRW and sulfasalazine significantly improved bodyweight, DAI, mucosal damage, crypt loss, and spleen weight compared to control. Both treatments significantly decreased inflammation (high-sensitive C-reactive protein) and restored redox balance (total thiol, superoxide dismutase, catalase activity). There was a trend for the combination treatment to be more effective than either HRW or sulfasalazine alone. Furthermore, HRW tended to be as effective as, and often more effective than, sulfasalazine. HRW may serve as a therapeutic for ameliorating DSS-induced colitis in mice."

Upon analysis of published and proprietary data, we concluded that these three medical gases can manipulate the neuroendocrine system, by modulating the production or release of hormones via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes, or the gastrointestinal pathway. With repeated administration of the gases over time, these modulations become a predictable consequence of conditioned homeostatic reflexes, resulting in regulation of physiological activity. For example, the regular activation of the unconditioned defense reflex in response to repeated intoxication by ozone leads to the formation of an anticipatory stable conditioned response, which counteracts the toxic action of O3. The concept of a Pavlovian conditioned reflex (or hormoligosis) is a brief metaphor for the understanding the therapeutic effect of systemic ozone therapy.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of molecular hydrogen (H2) on MNU-induced corneal endothelial cell (CEC) injury and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: MNU-induced animal models of CEC injury were washed with hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) for 14 days. Immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemical staining, and corneal endothelial assessment were applied to determine architectural and cellular changes on the corneal endothelium following HRS treatment. MNU-induced cell models of CEC injury were co-cultured with H2. The effect of H2 was examined using morphological and functional assays. RESULTS: It was shown that MNU could inhibit the proliferation and specific physiological functions of CECs by increasing apoptosis and decreasing the expression of ZO-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase, whereas H2 improved the proliferation and physiological function of CECs by anti-apoptosis. Cell experiments further confirmed that H2 could reverse MNU damage to CECs by decreasing oxidative stress injury, interfering with the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway and the FOXO3a/p53/p21 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that topical application of H2 could protect CECs against corneal damage factors through anti-apoptotic effect, reduce the incidence and severity of corneal endothelial decompensation, and maintain corneal transparency.",

      "abstract": "Noise exposure is the most important external factor causing acquired hearing loss in humans, and it is strongly associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cochlea. Several studies reported that the administration of various compounds with antioxidant effects can treat oxidative stress-induced hearing loss. However, traditional systemic drug administration to the human inner ear is problematic and has not been successful in a clinical setting. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop rescue treatment for patients with acute acoustic injuries. Hydrogen gas has antioxidant effects, rapid distribution, and distributes systemically after inhalation.The purpose of this study was to determine the protective efficacy of a single dose of molecular hydrogen (H2) on cochlear structures. Guinea pigs were divided into six groups and sacrificed immediately after or at 1 or 2 weeks. The animals were exposed to broadband noise for 2 h directly followed by 1-h inhalation of 2% H2 or room air. Electrophysiological hearing thresholds using frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) were measured prior to noise exposure and before sacrifice. ABR thresholds were significantly lower in H2-treated animals at 2 weeks after exposure, with significant preservation of outer hair cells in the entire cochlea. Quantification of synaptophysin immunoreactivity revealed that H2 inhalation protected the cochlear inner hair cell synaptic structures containing synaptophysin. The inflammatory response was greater in the stria vascularis, showing increased Iba1 due to H2 inhalation.Repeated administration of H2 inhalation may further improve the therapeutic effect. This animal model does not reproduce conditions in humans, highlighting the need for additional real-life studies in humans."

      "abstract": "Chinese chive usually becomes decayed after a short storage time, which was closely observed with the redox imbalance. To cope with this practical problem, in this report, molecular hydrogen (H2) was used to evaluate its influence in maintaining storage quality of Chinese chive, and the changes in antioxidant capacity were also analyzed. Chives were treated with 1%, 2%, or 3% H2, and with air as the control, and then were stored at 4 ± 1 °C. We observed that, compared with other treatment groups, the application of 3% H2 could significantly prolong the shelf life of Chinese chive, which was also confirmed by the obvious mitigation of decreased decay index, the loss ratio of weight, and the reduction in soluble protein content. Meanwhile, the decreasing tendency in total phenolic, flavonoid, and vitamin C contents was obviously impaired or slowed down by H2. Results of antioxidant capacity revealed that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was differentially alleviated, which positively matched with 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and the improved activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Above results clearly suggest that postharvest molecular hydrogen application might be a potential useful approach to improve the storage quality of Chinese chive, which is partially achieved through the alleviation of oxidative damage happening during the storage periods. These findings also provide potential theoretical and practical significance for transportation and consumption of perishable vegetables."

      "abstract": "Although ionizing radiation (radiation) is commonly used for medical diagnosis and cancer treatment, radiation-induced damages cannot be avoided. Such damages can be classified into direct and indirect damages, caused by the direct absorption of radiation energy into DNA and by free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), generated in the process of water radiolysis. More specifically, radiation damage concerns not only direct damages to DNA, but also secondary damages to non-DNA targets, because low-dose radiation damage is mainly caused by these indirect effects. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has the potential to be a radioprotective agent because it can selectively scavenge •OH, a reactive oxygen species with strong oxidizing power. Animal experiments and clinical trials have reported that H2 exhibits a highly safe radioprotective effect. This paper reviews previously reported radioprotective effects of H2 and discusses the mechanisms of H2, not only as an antioxidant, but also in intracellular responses including anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and the regulation of gene expression. In doing so, we demonstrate the prospects of H2 as a novel and clinically applicable radioprotective agent.",

      "abstract": "Lung grafts may experience multiple injuries during lung transplantation, such as warm ischaemia, cold ischaemia, and reperfusion injury. These injuries all contribute to primary graft dysfunction, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. As a potential selective antioxidant, hydrogen molecule (H2) protects against post-transplant complications in animal models of multiple organ transplantation. Herein, the authors review the current literature regarding the effects of H2 on lung injury from lung transplantation. The reviewed studies showed that H2 improved the outcomes of lung transplantation by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation at the donor and recipient phases. H2 is primarily administered via inhalation, drinking hydrogen-rich water, hydrogen-rich saline injection, or a hydrogen-rich water bath. H2 favorably modulates signal transduction and gene expression, resulting in the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and excess reactive oxygen species production. Although H2 appears to be a physiological regulatory molecule with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, its exact mechanisms of action remain elusive. Taken together, accumulating experimental evidence indicates that H2 can significantly alleviate transplantation-related lung injury, mainly via inhibition of inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduction in oxidative stress through several underlying mechanisms. Further animal experiments and preliminary human clinical trials will lay the foundation for the use of H2 as a treatment in the clinic.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of molecular hydrogen on the pathogenesis of asthma. METHODS: OVA sensitized asthma mouse model and house dust mite treated 16HBE cellular model were established and hydrogen/oxygen mixture was used to treat asthmatic mice and 16HBE cells. Serum and BALF cytokines were measured with specific ELISA assays. E-cadherin and ZO-1 were detected by immunohistochemical staining and expression of caspase 3 and 9, NF-κB, IL-33 and ST2 was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and/or immunofluorescence. IL-33 promoter activity was analyzed by dual-luciferase assay. ILC2 population was assayed by flow cytometry and differentially expressed miRNAs were detected using miRNA array. RESULTS: Serum and BALF levels of IL-33 and other alarmin and type II cytokines were greatly increased by OVA and inhibited by H2 in asthmatic mice. The expression of NF-κB (p65) and ST2 was upregulated by OVA and suppressed by H2. ILC2 population was markedly increased in OVA-induced asthmatic mice, and such increase was inhibited by H2. E-cadherin and ZO-1 levels in airway tissues of asthmatic mice were significantly lower than that of control mice, and the reduction was recovered by H2 treatment. H2 alleviated HDM induced apoptosis of 16HBE cells, upregulation of IL-33 and ST2, and elevation of IL-33 promoter activity. A group of miRNAs differentially expressed in HDM and HDM + H2 treated 16HBE cells were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that H2 is efficient in suppressing allergen-induced asthma and could be developed as a therapeutics for asthma and other conditions of type II inflammation.",

Molecular hydrogen (H2) is known to be effective against various diseases; therefore, we aimed to elucidate the effects of H2 on tear dynamics and the treatment of dry eye disease. We revealed that administering a persistent H2-generating supplement increased the human exhaled H2 concentration (p < 0.01) and improved tear stability (p < 0.01) and dry eye symptoms (p < 0.05) significantly. Furthermore, H2 significantly increased tear secretion in healthy mice (p < 0.05) and significantly suppressed tear reduction in a murine dry eye model (p = 0.007). H2 significantly and safely improved tear stability and dry eye symptoms in a small exploratory group of 10 human subjects, a subset of whom reported dry eye symptoms prior to treatment. Furthermore, it increased tear secretion rapidly in normal mice. Therefore, H2 may be a safe and effective new treatment for dry eye disease and thus larger trials are warranted.",

As such, H2 has been suggested to be used in the therapy of diseases in humans and in plant science to enhance the growth and productivity of plants. Treatments of plants may involve the creation of hydrogen-rich water (HRW), which can then be applied to the foliage or roots systems of the plants. However, the molecular action of H2 remains elusive. It has been suggested that the presence of H2 may act as an antioxidant or on the antioxidant capacity of cells, perhaps through the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals. H2 may act through influencing heme oxygenase activity or through the interaction with reactive nitrogen species. However, controversy exists around all the mechanisms suggested. Here, the downstream mechanisms in which H2 may be involved are critically reviewed, with a particular emphasis on the H2 mitigation of stress responses. Hopefully, this review will provide insight that may inform future research in this area."

Protons (H+) and molecular hydrogen (H2) in the cell are critical in a wide variety of processes. A new cancer treatment uses H2, a biologically inactive gas. Due to its small molecular weight, H2 can rapidly penetrate cell membranes and reach subcellular components to protect nuclear DNA and mitochondria. H2 reduces oxidative stress, exerts anti-inflammatory effects, and acts as a modulator of apoptosis. Exogenous H2, administered by inhalation, drinking H2-rich water, or injecting H2-rich saline solution, is a protective therapy that can be used in multiple diseases, including cancer. In particle therapy, cyclotrons and synchrotrons are the accelerators currently used to produce protons. Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) offers great promise for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers due to the sharp decrease in the dose of radiation at a defined point. In these conditions, H2 and different types of H2 donors may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Molecular hydrogen (H2 ) has been reported to have important biological effects on bone tissue in several in vitro and in vivo models. Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryo is a good model to study osteogenesis because of its transparency, size and rapid development. In zebrafish embryo, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) does not affect vitality or growth rate up to 15%. In addition, 7% HRW treatment enhances zebrafish embryo osteogenesis, increasing the vertebral mineralization rate. In conclusion, we demonstrated the beneficial effects of hydrogen on anabolic bone functions in vivo.",

      "abstract": "Many diseases as well as acute conditions can lead to fatigue, which can be either temporary or chronic in nature. Acute fatigue develops frequently after physical exercise or after alcohol hangover, whereas microbial infections such as influenza or COVID-19 and chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis are often associated with chronic fatigue. Oxidative stress and a resulting disturbance of mitochondrial function are likely to be common denominators for many forms of fatigue, and antioxidant treatments have been shown to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of fatigue. In this study, we review the role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in fatigue and the antioxidant effects of the intake of molecular hydrogen. We propose that molecular hydrogen is well suited for the treatment of temporary and chronic forms of oxidative stress-associated fatigue.",

      "abstract": "The increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress are important factors contributing to the development of diseases of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Molecular hydrogen is recognized as an emerging therapeutic, and its positive effects in the treatment of pathologies have been documented in both experimental and clinical studies. The therapeutic potential of hydrogen is attributed to several major molecular mechanisms. This review focuses on the effects of hydrogen on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems, and summarizes current knowledge about its actions, including the regulation of redox and intracellular signaling, alterations in gene expressions, and modulation of cellular responses (e.g., autophagy, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling). We summarize the functions of hydrogen as a regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated redox signaling and the association of hydrogen with mitochondria as an important target of its therapeutic action. The antioxidant functions of hydrogen are closely associated with protein kinase signaling pathways, and we discuss possible roles of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are mediated through glycogen synthase kinase 3β and its involvement in the regulation of cellular apoptosis. Additionally, current knowledge about the role of molecular hydrogen in the modulation of autophagy and matrix metalloproteinases-mediated tissue remodeling, which are other responses to cellular stress, is summarized in this review."

      "abstract": "Pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by acinar cell injury and is associated with the abnormal release of trypsin, which results in high mortality due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The inflammatory response, impaired autophagic flux, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and their interactions are involved in the development of pancreatitis. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a novel antioxidant that possesses the features of selective scavenging of oxygen free radicals and nontoxic metabolites and has been shown to be efficacious for treating infection, injury, tumors, ischemia-reperfusion organ injury, metabolic disease and several other diseases. Recent studies have found that H2 is also useful in the treatment of pancreatitis, which may be related to the mechanism of antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, regulation of immunity and regulation of molecular pathways. This review focuses on the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and the research progress and potential mechanisms of H2 against pancreatitis to provide theoretical bases for future research and clinical application of H2 therapy for pancreatitis.",

      "abstract": "Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a physiologically inert gas. However, during the last 10 years, increasing evidence has revealed its biological functions under pathological conditions. More specifically, H2 has protective effects against a variety of diseases, particularly nervous system disorders, which include ischemia/reperfusion injury, traumatic injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive dysfunction induced by surgery and anesthesia, anxiety, and depression. In addition, H2 plays protective roles mainly through anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, the regulation of autophagy, and preservation of mitochondrial function and the blood-brain barrier. Further, H2 is easy to use and has neuroprotective effects with no major side-effects, indicating that H2 administration is a potential therapeutic strategy in clinical settings. Here we summarize the H2 donors and their pharmacokinetics. Meanwhile, we review the effectiveness and safety of H2 in the treatment of various nervous system diseases based on preclinical and clinical studies, leading to the conclusion that H2 can be a simple and effective clinical therapy for CNS diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and diseases characterized by cognitive dysfunction. The potential mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effect of H2 are also analyzed.",
