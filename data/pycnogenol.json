      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the potential use of a food supplement, Pycnogenol® (French maritime Pine Bark Extract) as an anti-inflammatory management during the remission phases of four conditions with a vasculitis component: systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's disease, Sjögren Syndrome and polyarteritis nodosa. Symptoms were minimal but persisting and the subjects did not use any chronic drug treatment. METHODS: The aim of this pilot registry study was to evaluate the safety and the preventive effects of oral Pycnogenol® on the residual symptoms of the inflammatory conditions and possible effects on the recurrence of symptoms in a 4-week, open, supplement registry study. RESULTS: The registry study included 124 otherwise healthy subjects, suffering from one of the vasculitis conditions with 63 patients taking Pycnogenol® 150 mg per day and 61 serving as controls. There were no dropouts. Symptom distribution was comparable in the control and in the supplement groups at baseline. No side effects of Pycnogenol® supplementation were observed. The symptom scores that ranged from 0 to 10, decreased significantly in all the Pycnogenol® groups after 4 weeks compared to controls (P<0.05). After 4 weeks ESR values decreased significantly in all Pycnogenol® groups compared to controls (P<0.05). The proportion of subjects with high IL-6 (>5.9 pg/mL) decreased significantly after 4 weeks in the Pycnogenol® group compared to controls. The proportion of subjects that needed to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids to relieve signs and symptoms was significantly lower across all Pycnogenol® subjects at 4 weeks compared to controls. Finally, plasma oxidative stress (high, >300 Carr Units, in all subjects at inclusion) was significantly reduced (P<0.05) in the supplemented subjects, with minimal improvements in the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, supplementation with Pycnogenol® may offer advantages and management possibilities for patients with vasculitis diseases allowing to avoid more potentially dangerous drug treatments. Considering a prolonged course, it is possible that chronic management with Pycnogenol® may prevent the recurrence of diseases with a vasculitis component to clinically significant levels."

      "abstract": "Background: This study aims to elucidate the potential protective effects of Pycnogenol® against noise-induced hearing (NIHL) loss in a rat model. Methods: This study employed a randomized controlled design to investigate the potential protective effects of Pycnogenol® against NIHL in a rat model. Twenty-five male Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups (n=5 per group): a control group receiving saline administration, a noise exposure group, a noise+saline receiving group, only Pycnogenol® receiving group, and finally, a Pycnogenol® treatment group receiving daily oral administration of Pycnogenol® at 40 mg/kg/day via gavage for 7 days following noise exposure. All groups were subjected to auditory brainstem response assessments at 4 time points: pre-exposure (baseline), post-exposure day 1, day 7, and day 21. Both noise exposure and the Pycnogenol® treatment groups were exposed to 4 kHz narrowband noise at 120 dB SPL for 4 hours. Following sacrifice, histological and immunohistochemical evaluations were conducted on cochlear tissues. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 25 to determine significant differences between groups and across time points. Results: Outcome of this research shows that the auditory brainstem response thresholds and cochlear morphology between the experimental and control groups are significantly different from each other, suggesting that Pycnogenol® may have the potential to prevent NIHL loss in rats. Conclusion: Pycnogenol® shows potential in protecting against NIHL. However, further research, particularly at the molecular level, is necessary to better understand its therapeutic mechanisms and its specific impact on auditory metabolic processes.",

      "abstract": "Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are used in products that are applied to the human body, such as cosmetics and food, but their biocompatibility remains controversial. Pycnogenol (PYC), a natural extract of pine bark, exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, we investigated whether PYC effectively alleviates pulmonary toxicity induced by airway exposure to TiO2NPs, and the beneficial effects of PYC were explained through the analysis of changes to the mechanism of cytotoxicity. TiO2NPs induced pulmonary inflammation and mucus production, increased the levels of malondialdehyde, and upregulated thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and cleaved-caspase 3 (Cas3) in the lungs of mice. However, PYC treatment reduced the levels of all toxicity markers of TiO2NPs and restored glutathione levels. These antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of PYC were also demonstrated in TiO2NP-exposed human airway epithelial cells by increasing the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and decreasing the expression of TXNIP, cleaved-Cas3, and inflammatory mediators. Taken together, our results showed that PYC attenuated TiO2NP-induced lung injury via TXNIP downregulation. Therefore, our results suggest the potential of PYC as an effective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent against TiO2NP-induced pulmonary toxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The leading cause of cancer-related fatalities in women globally is breast cancer. Chemotherapy is one of the traditional therapies for breast cancer, even though it does not target cancer cells directly and has major side effects. As a result, the development of novel therapeutic techniques with improved safety and effectiveness is constantly required. AIM:  This study aimed to investigate the pro-apoptotic and anti-migrative effects of pycnogenol in a breast cancer cell line. METHODOLOGY:  By using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, the cell viability of breast cancer cells treated with pycnogenol was evaluated. Pycnogenol was applied to the MCF-7 cells in a range of concentrations (20-120 µg/ml) for 24 hours. A phase contrast microscope is used to evaluate changes in cell morphology. In breast cancer cells, acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) dual staining were employed to analyze the nuclear morphological alterations. A fluorescent microscope was used to see the apoptotic nuclei. A scratch wound healing assay was performed to evaluate the anti-migrative potential of pycnogenol. Gene expression analysis was performed using quantitative real-time PCR to determine the levels of proapoptotic and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) genes mRNA expression.  Results: In our investigation, breast cancer cells treated with pycnogenol displayed a substantial reduction in cell viability and a statistically significant p<0.05 between the control and treatment groups. We observed inhibitory concentrations (IC-50) at 80 μg/mL in breast cancer cells. After treatment, fewer cells were present, and those that were there shrank and showed cytoplasmic membrane blebbing. Under AO/EtBr staining, treated cells show chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. The results of this study revealed a significant downregulation of Bcl-2, VEGF/FGF, and p53 mRNA expression following treatment with pycnogenol. Furthermore, the impact of pycnogenol on cell migration decreased significantly when compared to control cells. Pycnogenol treatment significantly induces apoptosis and inhibits migration by altering the VEGF signaling pathway.  Conclusion: Overall, this study highlights the promising role of pycnogenol as a proapoptotic and antimigrative agent through the inhibition of anti-apoptotic and VEGF/FGF signaling molecules gene expression, offering new prospects for improving breast cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Pycnogenol (PYC), a standardized extract from French maritime pine, has traditionally been used to treat inflammation. However, its primary active components and their mechanisms of action have not yet been determined. Methods: This study employed UPLC-MS/MS (Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and network pharmacology to identify the potential active components of PYC and elucidate their anti-inflammatory mechanisms by cell experiments. Results: 768 PYC compounds were identified and 19 anti-inflammatory compounds were screened with 85 target proteins directly involved in the inflammation. PPI (protein-protein interaction) analysis identified IL6, TNF, MMP9, IL1B, AKT1, IFNG, CXCL8, NFKB1, CCL2, IL10, and PTGS2 as core targets. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis suggested that the compound in PYC might exert anti-inflammatory effects through the IL17 and TNF signal pathways. Cell experiments determined that PYC treatment can reduce the expression of IL6 and IL1β to relieve inflammation in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced BV2 cells. Conclusion: PYC could affect inflammation via multi-components, -targets, and -mechanisms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of the global population has been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at some point since the onset of the pandemic. Although most individuals who develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover without complications, about 6% have persistent symptoms, referred to as post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). Intervention studies investigating treatments that potentially alleviate PCC-related symptoms and thus aim to mitigate the global public health burden and healthcare costs linked to PCC are desperately needed. The PYCNOVID trial investigates the effects of Pycnogenol®, a French maritime pine bark extract with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, versus placebo on patient-reported health status in people with PCC. METHODS: This is a single-center, placebo-controlled, quadruple blind, randomized trial. We aim to randomly assign 150 individuals with PCC (1:1 ratio) to receive either 200 mg Pycnogenol® or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Randomization is stratified for duration of PCC symptoms (≤ 6 months versus > 6 months) and presence of symptomatic chronic disease(s). The primary endpoint is perceived health status at 12 weeks (EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale) adjusted for baseline values and stratification factors. Secondary endpoints include change in self-reported PCC symptoms, health-related quality of life, symptoms of depression and anxiety, cognitive function, functional exercise capacity, physical activity measured with accelerometry, and blood biomarkers for endothelial health, inflammation, coagulation, platelet function, and oxidative stress. Investigators, study participants, outcome assessors, and data analysts are blinded regarding the intervention assignment. Individuals with PCC were involved in the design of this study. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to investigate the effects of Pycnogenol® versus placebo on patient-reported health status in people with PCC. Should the trial proof clinical effectiveness, Pycnogenol® may serve as a therapeutic approach to mitigate symptoms associated with PCC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. :NCT05890534, June 6, 2023.",

This study explores the healing efficacy of composite dressings containing these extracts, aiming to enhance their stability and effectiveness, utilizing a low-temperature vacuum method for producing Sodium Alginate-Maltodextrin gel dressings. Surgical wounds were inflicted on SKH-hr2 hairless mice. Dressings were loaded with Pycnogenol™ and/or C. oestroides extracts and assessed for their efficacy. Wound healing was primarily evaluated by clinical and histopathological evaluation and secondarily by Antera 3D camera and biophysical measurements. Dressings were stable and did not compromise the therapeutic properties of C. oestroides extract. All interventions were compared to the C. oestroides ointment as a reference product. Most of the wounds treated with the reference formulation and the C. oestrodes dressing had already closed by the 15th day, with histological scores of 7 and 6.5, respectively. In contrast, wounds treated with Pycnogenol™, either alone or in combination with C. oestroides, did not close by the end of the experiment (16th day), with histological scores reaching 15 in both cases. Furthermore, treatment with 5% Pycnogenol™ dressing appeared to induce skin thickening and increase body temperature. The study underscores the wound healing potential of C. oestroides extracts and highlights the need for further research to optimize Pycnogenol™ dosing in topical applications."

The synthesis and characterization of the modified drug are performing successfully, the loading and release process of the MOL drug on a nano surface is measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy under room temperature and different pH. The release efficiency of the MOL drug is calculated to be 65% (pH 6.8) and 69% (pH 7.4).

The biological activity of the MOL-drug and modified MOL-drug is measured, and the cytotoxicity is performed by SRB technique, where the self-assembly (CNC@Pyc) appears to be a safe healthy, and high viability against the examined cell line. The antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory are evaluated, where the nanocomposite that has ZnO NPs (CNC@Pyc.MOL.ZnO) gave high efficiency compared to the composite without ZnO NPs.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study was constructed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We searched seven databases from inception to 15 February 2023, for a comprehensive search of clinical trials using relevant keywords. Continuous variables in this meta-analysis were calculated using the mean difference and 95% confidence interval. All relevant statistical analyses were performed using RevMan v. 5.4 software. RESULTS: Three studies with 184 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in the basic characteristics of the included studies. The results of the current meta-analysis showed that there were significant differences in the international index of erectile function scores (erectile domain), intercourse satisfaction scores, orgasmic function scores, overall satisfaction scores, and sexual desire scores between the combination treatment group and the control group. There was no significant difference in improving the testosterone levels between the two groups. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the combination of PAL may have a significant effect on improving sexual function in patients with mild to moderate ED. This study will provide clinicians with more options for treating patients with ED. More randomized controlled trials are needed in the future to further demonstrate the effect of combination therapy on sexual function in patients with ED.

The characterization procedure works to verify the creation of nanocomposite (NCP) using several different techniques. UV-Vis spectroscopy is used to measure SOF loading efficiency. The various concentrations of the SOF drug were used to determine the binding constant rate Kb, which was found to be 7.35 ± 0.95 min-1 with an 83% loading efficiency. At pH 7.4, the release rate was 80.6% after two hours and 92% after 48 h, whereas at pH 6.8, it was 29% after two hours and 94% after 48 h. After 2 and 48 h, the release rate in water was 38% and 77%, respectively. . The SRB technique for fast screening is used for the cytotoxicity test, where the investigated composites show a safety status and high viability against the examined cell line. The cytotoxicity assay of the SOF hybrid materials has been identified with cell lines like mouse normal liver cells (BNL). So, Cs@Pyc.SOF was recommended as a substitute medication for the therapy of HCV, but the results need clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A gerbil model of ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury in the forebrain has been developed for studies on mechanisms, prevention and therapeutic strategies of IR injury in the forebrain. Pycnogenol® (PYC), a standardized extract of French maritime pine tree (Pinus pinaster Aiton) has been exploited as an additive for dietary supplement. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of post-treatment with PYC and its therapeutic mechanisms in gerbils. METHODS: The gerbils were given sham and IR operation and intraperitoneally injected with vehicle and Pycnogenol® (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively) immediately, at 24 hours and 48 hours after sham and IR operation. Through 8-arm radial maze test and passive avoidance test, each spatial memory and short-term memory function was assessed. To examine the neuroprotection of Pycnogenol®, we conducted cresyl violet staining, immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclei, and Fluoro-Jade B histofluorescence. Moreover, we carried out immunohistochemistry for immunoglobulin G (IgG) to investigate blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to examine change in pro-inflammatory cytokine. RESULTS: We found that IR-induced memory deficits were significantly ameliorated when 100 mg/kg Pycnogenol® was treated. In addition, treatment with 100 mg/kg Pycnogenol®, not 25 mg/kg nor 50 mg/kg, conferred neuroprotective effect against IR injury. For its mechanisms, we found that 100 mg/kg Pycnogenol® significantly reduced BBB leakage and inhibited the expression of IL-1β. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic treatment (post-treatment) with Pycnogenol® after IR effectively attenuated ischemic brain injury in gerbils. Based on these results, we suggest that PYC can be employed as an important material for ischemic drugs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the histopathological changes, enzymatic alterations, and DNA damage in rat lungs induced by whole-body gamma irradiation as well as evaluation of the protective effect of pycnogenol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hundred adult male rats were equally divided into ten groups including control, four antioxidants, γ-irradiation, four antioxidant + γ-irradiations. This study began the day before radiation treatment and continued for 3 days. The pycnogenol was dissolved 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and then administered orally through a gastric tube at a dose of 37.5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg in 24, 48, and 72 h before irradiation. Irradiation was applied with a whole-body irradiation dose of 900 cGy in one fraction. DNA damage, histopathological changes, catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in lung tissue of rats were evaluated 3 days after irradiation. RESULTS: CAT and SOD activities were found to be significantly lower in the irradiation group than control (P < 0.001). CAT and SOD activities were higher in the antioxidant + γ-irradiation group than both irradiation and control groups. MDA levels were significantly higher in the irradiation group compared to control (P < 0.001), whereas MDA levels decreased in the antioxidant + γ-irradiation group compared to the irradiation group. The antioxidant groups were significantly increased comet parameters depend on pycnogenol doses compared to control. The antioxidant + γ-irradiation was decreased comet parameter compared to γ-irradiation. As a result of the histopathologically, the antioxidant groups were different than the control group that in the areas of alveolar sacs and connective tissue areas were seen hemorrhage areas similar to the irradiation group. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that 300 mg/kg of pycnogenol might provide significant protection against deleterious effects from whole-body ionizing radiation on the lung tissue. P300+ γ-ray group was significantly reduced radiation-induced lung injury and was possible to observe significantly preservation.",

It has been reported that pycnogenol increases the expression of COX-1, suppresses the expression rate of COX-2 and oxidative stress. Our aim in this study is to investigate the antiinflammatory activities of indomethacin, pycnogenol, and their combination (PI) in rats and to examine their effects on stomach tissue. In the study, anti-inflammatory activity was investigated in carrageenan-induced inflammatory paw edema in albino Wistar male rats. Effects on stomach tissue were performed by applying the previous method. PI, indomethacin and pycnogenol were the best suppressors of carrageenan inflammation and oxidative stress in paw tissue, respectively. While the groups with the lowest COX-1 activity in paw tissue were IC, PIC and PC, respectively, PIC, IC and PC were the ones that best inhibited the increase in COX-2 activity. Pycnogenol inhibited the increase of malondialdehyde, the decrease of total glutathione and COX-1 in the stomach, and significantly suppressed the formation of indomethacin ulcers. Our experimental results showed that pycnogenol reduced the toxic effect of indomethacin on the stomach and increased anti-inflammatory activity. This beneficial interaction of pycnogenol and indomethacin suggests that PI will provide superior success in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this pilot registry study was to assess the preventive effect of an 8-week Pycnogenol® (French maritime pine bark extract) supplementation on symptoms, such as cognitive and motor aspects, in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: The study was based on five types of observations: a. Karnofsky performance scale index; b. oxidative stress markers in plasma (plasma free radicals, PFR); c. the main signs and symptoms, evaluated by a physician; d. face motion and expressions and their symmetry, recorded with a high-speed video camera. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients were included in the study: 39 controls using only standard management (SM) and 40 subjects supplemented with Pycnogenol® 150 mg/day. At inclusion, the two groups (SM and SM+Pycnogenol®) were comparable for age, symptoms, Karnofsky performance scale rating and for the management of PD. Likewise, oxidative stress and the presence of peripheral edema were also comparable between the two groups. No side effects of supplementation were observed. There were no tolerability problems. At the end of the study after 8 weeks, the Karnofsky performance index was significantly (P<0.05) higher with Pycnogenol® compared to controls. Also, the proportion of patients with a clinically visible peripheral edema decreased significantly over 8 weeks with Pycnogenol® compared to controls (P<0.05). Plasma oxidative stress was significantly lower with Pycnogenol® (P<0.05). The scores of PD main signs/symptoms like tremor, bradykinesia, alterations in cognitive functions, rigidity and speech impairment were significantly lower in the Pycnogenol® group compared to controls (P<0.05). Face expression evaluation showed a marked asymmetry at inclusion. Over 8-week supplementation, facial expression scores for visible and subliminal asymmetry, altered facial responses, altered shoulder motion and altered emotional pattern improved significantly in the Pycnogenol® group compared to controls (P<0.05) where the scores did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, according to this pilot registry study, Pycnogenol® supplementation helps patients with moderate, well-controlled PD - under stable treatment - to attenuate most signs and symptoms and life-relational aspects associated with Parkinson-related cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most commonly used chemotherapies for various types of cancer, including leukemia, breast cancer, hepatocarcinoma, and gastric cancers. However, the efficacy of MTX is frequently limited by serious side effects. Several studies have reported that the cytotoxic effect of MTX is not limited to cancer cells but can also affect normal tissues, leading to prospective damage to many organs. In the present study, we extensively investigated the molecular and microscopic basis of MTX-induced toxicity in different organs (liver, kidney, and heart) and explored the possible protective effect of pycnogenol, a polyphenolic component extracted from the bark of P. pinaster, to attenuate these effects. Biochemical analysis revealed that administration of MTX significantly reduced the function of the liver, kidney, and heart. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that MTX treatment caused damage to tissues of different organs. Interestingly, administration of pycnogenol (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the deterioration effects of MTX on different organs in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by biochemical and histological analysis. Our results reveal that pycnogenol successfully ameliorated oxidative damage and reduced toxicity, inflammatory response, and histological markers induced by methotrexate treatment. Taken together, this study provides solid evidence for the pharmacological application of pycnogenol to attenuate damage to different organs induced by MTX treatment."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The corneal alkali-burn injury (CA-I) model was unilaterally developed in Wistar rats by filter paper saturated with 0.01 M of NaOH and touching the eyes for 45 s. Rats were divided into four groups: Normal control (NC), normal PYC (NPYC), diabetic control (DC), and diabetic PYC (DPYC). Both NPYC and DPYC groups were daily treated with PY eye drops three times, whereas NC and DC ones were treated with ordinary saline for six successive days. RESULTS: The wound healing of corneal epithelial was improved in the NPYC group compared to the NC group. Meanwhile, it was significantly improved (P < 0.05) in the DPYC group than in the DC group. Histological examination revealed that corneal re-epithelialization was more accomplished in the DPYC group than in the DC group. In addition, the inflammatory cells were augmented in the DC group more than those in the DPYC one. CONCLUSION: The findings obtained revealed the efficiency of PYC for enhancing the corneal re-epithelialization and reducing the inflammatory reaction post alkali burn in rats, and thus it could be beneficially valuable as a treatment for the diabetic keratopathy.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of chronic diseases has increased significantly with the rising trend of sedentary lifestyles, reduced physical activity, and dietary modifications in recent decades. Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the pathophysiology of several chronic diseases, such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hepatic conditions. Therefore, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of various chronic disorders. Since chronic diseases are not completely curable, various methods have been proposed for their control. Complementary therapies and the use of natural antioxidant and antiinflammatory compounds are among these novel approaches. Pycnogenol (PYC) is a natural compound that could control inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, some previous studies have shown that PYC could effectively reduce inflammation through signaling the downstream of insulin receptors, inhibiting the phosphorylation of the serine residues of insulin receptor substrate-1, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress indices through the stimulation of antioxidant pathways, increasing free radical scavenging activities, preventing lipid peroxidation, and protecting the erythrocytes in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals, although these effects have not been fully proved. The present study aimed to comprehensively review the evidence concerning the positive physiological and pharmacological properties of PYC, with an emphasis on the therapeutic potential of this natural component for enhancing human health.",

Forty adult male NMRI mice weighing about 30 g were randomly divided into five groups of eight. Saline group: received 3 μl of saline, as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) solvent, unilaterally in the left striatum, treatment groups: first received 3 µl 6-OHDA unilaterally inside the ipsilateral striatum and then divided into subgroup A: received distilled water, Pycnogenol solvent, by gavage for 7 days (lesion group), and subgroup B: received Pycnogenol at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg by gavage for 7 days. Seven days after Parkinson's model induction, the apomorphine test, the degree of catalepsy by bar test, the duration of immobility (depression) by forced swimming test (FST) were measured. In addition, the expression of NF-ƙB and Nrf2 genes was measured using the real-time PCR technique. The total number of rotations in the apomorphine test decreased significantly in the groups receiving Pycnogenol. Administration of Pycnogenol significantly reduced catalepsy. The study of depression in the group receiving Pycnogenol showed a significant reduction. Also, Pycnogenol increased the expression of the Nrf2 anti-inflammatory gene, but it had no significant difference in the expression of NF-ƙB gene. Pycnogenol, presumably with its antioxidative and genomic effects, improves the expression of the anti-inflammatory gene and found that neuroprotection effect in the brain.",

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 24 Wistar albino rats who were on the seventh postnatal day were divided into three groups with developed HI brain injury model under the sevoflurane anesthesia: 40 mg/kg PYC was given to Group A, saline was given to Group B, and the sham group was Group C. Neuronal apoptosis was investigated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and immunohistochemically stained manually with primer antibodies of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. RESULTS: The neuronal cell injury was statistically lower in the PYC treatment group. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that investigates the role of PYC in the HI brain injury model. PYC reduces apoptosis and neuronal injury in the cerebral tissue of the rats. PYC may be a protective agent against hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

A bioadhesive film, loaded with PYC, was prepared by casting, starting with a combination of two biopolymer acqueous solutions: xanthan gum (1% wt/wt) and sodium alginate (1.5% wt/wt), in a 2.5/7.5 (wt/wt) ratio. In both solutions, glycerol (10% wt/wt) was added as plasticizing agent. The film resulted in an adhesive capable to absorb a simulated wound fluid (~ 65% wt/wt within 1 h), therefore suitable for exuding wounds. The mechanical characterization showed that the film is deformable (elastic modulus E = 3.070 ± 0.044 MPa), suggesting adaptability to any type of surface and resistance to mechanical solicitations. PYC is released within 24 h by a sustained mechanism, achieving a maximum concentration of ~ 0.2 mg/mL, that is safe for keratinocytes, as shown by cytotoxicity studies. A concentration of 0.015 mg/mL is reached in the first 5 min after application, at which point PYC stimulates keratinocyte growth. These preliminary results suggest the use of PYC in formulations designed for topical use."

It might thus represent an easy-to-use strategy to improve the skin health of individuals who are exposed to considerable environmental stress in large urban areas. OBJECTIVE: We investigated if oral intake of Pycnogenol® can benefit the skin of Han Chinese working outdoors in Beijing, China. METHODS: In a monocentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and crossover study, the effects of Pycnogenol® intake (2 × 50 mg/day for a total of 12 weeks) on a variety of skin physiological parameters was studied in Chinese subjects (n = 76), from spring to autumn, who were working outdoors in Beijing, China. RESULTS: During the intervention period, study subjects were constantly exposed to increased levels of particulate matter (PM)2.5 as well as seasonal changes in humidity and temperature. Despite this environmental stress, Pycnogenol® intake prevented (i) a decrease in the skin hydration, (ii) transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and (iii) skin darkening during the dry autumn season. In addition, Pycnogenol® intake improved (iv) viscoelastic skin properties such as gross elasticity and elastic recovery irrespective of the season. These beneficial effects were not observed if the same subjects were supplemented with placebo. CONCLUSION: Oral intake of Pycnogenol® benefits the skin in Han Chinese, who are working outdoors under considerable environmental stress.",

It occurs when the body cannot keep its temperature healthy in response to a hot climate and associated with oxidative stress. Testicular hyperthermia can induce apoptosis of sperm cells, affect sperm production and decrease sperm concentration, leading to sperm disorder, for this reason, we examined the protective impact of pycnogenol that it has a wide range of biological benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities against the oxidative alterations that happen in testicular and brain tissues due to heat stress in rats. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-eight Wistar male rats, approximately around 6 weeks age were allocated randomly into four groups (12 in each) of control, HS (subjected to heat stress and supplemented orally with 50 mg of pycnogenol/kg b. w./day dissolved in saline for 21 days), and pycnogenol (rats supplemented orally with 50 mg of pycnogenol/kg b. w./day dissolved in saline for 21 days). RESULTS: Data revealed a promising role of pycnogenol as an antioxidant, natural product to successfully reverse the heat-induced oxidative alterations in testicular and brain tissues of rats through significant upregulation of superoxide dismutase-2, catalase, reduced glutathione, and anti-apoptotic gene, while downregulating pro-apoptotic, and heat shock protein70. Pycnogenol treatment also reversed the reproductive hormone level and spermatogenesis to their normal values. CONCLUSION: Pycnogenol as a natural protective supplement could recover these heat stress-induced oxidative changes in testes and hypothalamus.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 75 mg pycnogenol taken orally twice a day vs. a placebo, in association with the triple combination and broad-spectrum sunscreen for the treatment of facial melasma. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 44 women with facial melasma in a single centre from May 2019 through November 2019. Patients with melasma were randomly assigned to orally take 75 mg pycnogenol (PYC) or a placebo (PLAC) twice a day for 60 days. Both groups also received tinted sunscreen [Sun Protection Factor (SPF) 50; Persistent Pigment Darkening (PPD) 17] for daytime use and a topical triple combination at bedtime. The primary outcome was a change from the baseline Modified Melasma Area Severity Index (mMASI) score. Secondary outcomes were improvements in the patients' quality of life (MELASQoL), colorimetric indices and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). RESULTS: All participants completed the trial. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 39 (7) years, and 91% were phototypes III-IV. Both groups exhibited a reduction in mMASI scores, MELASQoL scores and colour contrast (P < 0.01). The mean (CI 95%) reductions of the mMASI scores were 49% (36-61%) for PYC and 34% (16-47%) for PLAC. The reductions in mMASI scores and colorimetric contrast were superior for the PYC group (P < 0.05). The analysis of GAIS resulted in an improvement of 86% (CI 95%: 68-96%) for the participants in the PYC group and 55% (CI 95%: 32-73%) for those in the PLAC group. There were no adverse effects related to oral treatment. CONCLUSION: Pycnogenol is well-tolerated and increases the effectiveness of broad-spectrum sunscreen and the triple combination in the treatment of facial melasma in women.",

However, there are few reports on neuroprotective effect of Pycnogenol® supplementation and its mechanisms against ischemic injury following transient forebrain ischemia (TFI) in gerbils. Now, we examined neuroprotective effect and its mechanisms of Pycnogenol® in the gerbils with 5-min TFI, which evokes a significant death (loss) of pyramidal cells located in the cornu ammonis (CA1) region of gerbil hippocampus from 4-5 days post-TFI. Gerbils were pretreated with 30, 40, and 50 mg/kg of Pycnogenol® once a day for 7 days before TFI surgery. Treatment with 50 mg/kg, not 30 or 40 mg/kg, of Pycnogenol® potently protected learning and memory, as well as CA1 pyramidal cells, from ischemic injury. Treatment with 50 mg/kg Pycnogenol® significantly enhanced immunoreactivity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutases and catalase) in the pyramidal cells before and after TFI induction. Furthermore, the treatment significantly reduced the generation of superoxide anion, ribonucleic acid oxidation and lipid peroxidation in the pyramidal cells. Moreover, interestingly, its neuroprotective effect was abolished by administration of sodium azide (a potent inhibitor of SODs and catalase activities). Taken together, current results clearly indicate that Pycnogenol® supplementation can prevent neurons from ischemic stroke through its potent antioxidative role.",

METHODS: Male Wistar rats were selected to establish a model of SCI in accordance with the Allen's protocol. The rats in the PYC group were treated with 100 mg/kg PYC by intraperitoneal injection 15 minutes after SCI. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale was used to evaluate locomotor activity. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) production were detected by ELISA. The expression of Cleaved-caspase 3, Bcl-2, Bax and the levels of Cytochrome c (Cyt-c) were analysed by Western blot or Immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we used the JC-1 fluorescent probe to analyse the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). RESULTS: The rats that received PYC had significantly higher BBB scores than the control lesion rats. PYC treatment resulted in reduced bleeding in spinal cord tissue and proliferation of glial cells, greater numbers of anterior horn neurons, more complete structures of residual neurons, and significant improvement in Nissl body morphology. In addition, PYC reduced MDA production and increased SOD activity. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was significantly increased in the PYC treatment group compared with the SCI group. In addition, PYC decreased the expression of Cleaved-caspase 3 and Bax and the release of Cyt-c and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in the SCI rats. CONCLUSIONS: The above findings suggested that PYC can improve motor function and reduce neuronal apoptosis after SCI by stabilizing the MMP through the inhibition of oxidative stress.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In the treatment of cancer, it is intended to increase the anticancer effect and decrease cytotoxicity using various plant-derived phenolic compounds with chemotherapeutic drugs. Pycnogenol® (PYC), a phenolic compound, has been the subject of many studies. Since the mechanisms of the interactions of PYC with cisplatin need to be clarified, we aimed to determine the effects of PYC on cisplatin cytotoxicity in human cervix cancer cells (HeLa) and to evaluate the genotoxicity of PYC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of cisplatin and PYC was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in HeLa cells for 24 h and 48 h. The effect of PYC against oxidative DNA damage was evaluated using the comet assay. RESULTS: The IC50 values of cisplatin were 22.4 μM and 12.3 μM for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. The IC50 values of PYC were 261 μM and 213 μM for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. For 24 h exposure, PYC significantly reduced the IC50 value of cisplatin at the selected concentrations (15.6-500 μM). For 48 h exposure, PYC did not change the cytotoxicity of cisplatin at concentrations between 15.6 and 125 μM, but significantly reduced it at concentrations of 250 μM and 500 μM. PYC alone did not induce DNA damage at concentrations of 10 μM or 25 μM; however, it significantly induced DNA damage at higher concentrations (50-100 μM). It also significantly reduced H2O2-induced DNA damage at all concentrations studied (10-100 μM). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that PYC may increase the cisplatin cytotoxicity in HeLa cells at nongenotoxic doses. The results might contribute to the anticancer effect of cisplatin with PYC in cervical carcinoma, but in order to confirm this result further in vitro studies with cancer cell lines and in vivo studies are needed."

Undertaking clinical studies with patients presenting with symptomless pre-T2D can lead to significant limitations. Methods: A 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted that investigated the safety and efficacy of an herbal formulation administered orally for the treatment of pre-type 2 diabetes (pre-T2D). Results: A numerically greater proportion of subjects in the interventional arm had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) at week 12 compared to the control arm (71.0% vs. 69.0%, p = 0.75). Fewer participants had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at 12 weeks in the intervention arm compared to the control arm (unadjusted 58.3% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.65; adjusting for baseline IGT, p = 0.266). In a subgroup analysis, subjects with a baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level in the range of 6.1-6.9 mmol/L demonstrated a non-significant lower proportion of IFG at week 12 in the intervention arm compared to the control arm (60.0% vs. 41.7% p = 0.343). Total blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels remained unchanged from baseline to week 12 in both treatment groups. Conclusions: This study suggests that a polyherbal medicine was not effective for reducing the metabolic markers associated with pre-T2D over a 12-week period. Therefore, larger studies with well-defined endpoints and of longer duration are warranted."

METHODS: A group of non-diabetic subjects and a group of diabetics were managed with standard management (SM) or with SM+Pycnogenol® (150 mg/day) for 2 weeks. RESULTS: In total, 48 subjects were included in the study; 24 diabetics and 24 non-diabetics. 12 diabetics and 12 non-diabetics took Pycnogenol® and 12 diabetics and 12 non-diabetics were followed up with standard management only and served as controls. No side effects and no tolerability problems were observed with Pycnogenol®. The registry groups were comparable for characteristics and symptoms at baseline. All otherwise healthy subjects had a BMI<26 kg/m2. In 2 weeks, salivary flow and oxidative stress improved significantly in both groups of subjects (non-diabetics and diabetics) with 150 mg/day Pycnogenol® (P<0.05), while minimal improvements in salivary flow were seen with SM. The subjective score and the number of mucosal breaks and ulcerations, all minimal (<1 mm in length or diameter), were significantly decreased with Pycnogenol® supplementation (P<0.05) with minimal variations in the SM controls. Finally, the mean lysozyme level in parotid saliva samples was significantly increased in the Pycnogenol® group (P<0.05) both in diabetics and non-diabetics. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these preliminary results, Pycnogenol® could be a new, valid option for the treatment of xerostomia.",

Immune-enhancing enteral formula has been proven to significantly reduce infection rate in TBI patients. One of the ingredients that can be used in immunonutrition formulas to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress is pycnogenol. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work is to survey the effect of pycnogenol on the clinical, nutritional, and inflammatory status of TBI patients. METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Block randomization will be used. An intervention group will receive pycnogenol supplementation of 150 mg for 10 days and a control group will receive a placebo for the same duration. Inflammatory status (IL-6, IL- 1β, C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress status (malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity), at the baseline, at the 5th day, and at the end of the study (10th day) will be measured. Clinical and nutritional status will be assessed three times during the intervention. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) questionnaire for assessment of organ failure will be filled out every other day. The mortality rate will be calculated within 28 days of the start of the intervention. Weight, body mass index, and body composition will be measured. All analyses will be conducted by an initially assigned study arm in an intention-to-treat analysis. DISCUSSION: We expect that supplementation of 150 mg pycnogenol for 10 days will improve clinical and nutritional status and reduce the inflammation and oxidative stress of the TBI patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ref: NCT03777683) at 12/13/2018.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this registry study in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) in treatment, was to evaluate the effects of Pycnogenol® supplementation on some accessory symptoms and cognitive functions (COFU). METHODS: The registry included 43 PD patients who had been diagnosed at least one year before the start of the study. The PD condition was considered mild, with minimal progression. The management for these patients was a monotherapy using carbidopa/levodopa (standard management; SM). Supplementary Pycnogenol® was used at 150 mg/day for 4 weeks. The neurological management was not affected. RESULTS: Tolerability and safety were very good; the two registry groups were comparable with comparable symptoms at baseline. The most disabling symptoms were considered tremor, bradychinesia, alterations in COFU, rigidity and speech changes. All symptoms were rated as mild-to-moderate. After 4 weeks, these target symptoms were significantly attenuated with the supplement in comparison with the SM only (P<0.05). Particularly the COFU score was significantly higher (P<0.05) with the supplement. No interference between the main neurological management and the supplement was observed. Oxidative stress (plasma free radicals), high in both registry groups at inclusion, was significantly lower in the supplement group at 4 weeks (P<0.05). The main PD-associated items (cognitive aspects, motory and postural aspects) considered the most common and disturbing problems were evaluated and scored (0 to 4) with a visual scale line. At 4 weeks, the scores for all items were lower in the supplement group in comparison with the control, SM group. Peripheral edema was present in all patients at inclusion. The edema was minimal at inclusion (at the ankle-foot level with pretibial extension) and present in all subjects. It changed in two SM subjects and was still present at 4 weeks in 19 out 22 of the SM patients. In the supplemented patients, edema (present at inclusion in all subjects), was visible in 4 subjects out of 21 (19%) at 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Pycnogenol® supplementation may help in selected patients with PD - under stable neurological treatment - to improve some signs and symptoms and some aspects associated with COFU. Studies are in progress on a larger population sample and with new evaluation methods.",

      "abstract": "Results of previous clinical trials evaluating the effect of pycnogenol supplementation on blood pressure (BP) are controversial. Therefore, we aimed to assess the impact of pycnogenol on BP through a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis of available randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies (randomized clinical trials [RCTs]). Literature search included SCOPUS, PubMed-Medline, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases up to January 10, 2019 to identify RCTs investigating the impact of pycnogenol on BP. Two investigators independently extracted data on study characteristics, methods, and outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under number CRD42018112172. Overall, the impact of pycnogenol on BP was reported in 7 trials involving 626 participants. Meta-analysis did not suggest any significant improvement in systolic BP (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -0.028 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.182 to 0.127; P = .726; I2 = 46%), diastolic BP (WMD: -0.144 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.299 to 0.010; P = .067; I2 = 0%), mean arterial pressure (WMD: -0.091 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.246 to 0.063; P = .246; I2 = 0%), and pulse pressure (WMD: -0.003 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.151 to 0.158; P = .966; I2 = 0%) following pycnogenol treatment. Results persisted in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. Therefore, the present meta-analysis does not suggest any significant effect of pycnogenol on BP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This registry study investigated the supplement Pycnogenol® on migraine headache attacks and oxidative stress in otherwise healthy subjects with migraine and moderate headache (MH). METHODS: To manage MH, these subjects used only a few drugs (antiemetics, analgesics on demand) and lifestyle changes; only very occasionally they used other, more specific products such as triptans. Study groups: one group used only standard management (SM), basically, management on demand. Oral magnesium and riboflavin (vitamin B2) were used with lipoic acid as they are considered useful to improve MH. Another group used the supplement Pycnogenol® (150 mg/day for 8 weeks) in addition to SM. These two groups were compared to a third (non-parallel, observational) group using topiramate (50 mg/day). If needed, subjects were allowed to use rescue medications. RESULTS: Forty-six subjects were included in the study. Twenty-two used the standard management and 24 were supplemented with Pycnogenol® in association with SM. In addition, 21 subjects were treated with topiramate. Safety with Pycnogenol® was very good. The two main management groups and the third non-parallel group had comparable baseline characteristics. The number of migraine attacks were significantly reduced during the observation period with Pycnogenol® (P<0.05) in comparison with SM. Supplementation was more effective in reducing the use of rescue medications (P<0.05) including analgesics compared to SM. At 8 weeks, the pain score was lower with Pycnogenol in comparison with SM (P<0.05). The working incapacity was significantly lower with Pycnogenol® than in the SM group (P<0.05). The number of migraine attacks was lower with topiramate compared to SM. Pain score, working incapacity and use of rescue medication were lower with topiramate than in SM. However, adverse effects with topiramate, included paresthesia, fatigue, dizziness and nausea even at low dosages complicated management. Some 50% of these side effects require a form of further treatment including medications. Oxidative stress: all included subjects had high oxidative stress at baseline. At 8 weeks, the level of plasma free radicals was significantly lowered with Pycnogenol® (P<0.05), but not in the SM or topiramate group. CONCLUSIONS: Pycnogenol® used as prophylaxis appears to reduce pain and the number and severity of symptoms in MH in parallel with a reduction of oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Raynaud syndrome (RS) is associated with vasospasm of the hand and fingers as a response to cold or stress. RS may cause discomfort and color changes (pallor, cyanosis, erythema, as single symptoms, but usually in combination, localized to one or more fingers). The aim of this 4-week registry study was the evaluation of subjects with mild, primary RS and their treatment with a standard management (SM) plan in comparison with SM associated with supplementation with Pycnogenol®. METHODS: A group of 67 females with mild, primary RS was included. All subjects were working in shops with refrigerators. No skin lesions were present. The age range was between 30 and 40; the vasospastic changes were symmetrical; no other physical findings were present. RESULTS: The two groups, receiving standard management (N.=33) or SM+Pycnogenol®, 100 mg/day, (N.=34) were comparable at inclusion. Considering the main symptoms, the decrease in coldness, burning pain, paresthesias and irregular color changes was more significant with Pycnogenol® (P<0.05) at 4 weeks. At thermography, low temperature areas and discrepancies in temperature and color were decreased with Pycnogenol® more than in controls (P<0.05). In the Pycnogenol® group, one subject (2.94%) decided to use drug treatment (PGE1) in 4 weeks in comparison with 5 controls (15.15%). The lowest finger temperature improved from 20.3° C at inclusion to 26.4° C at 4 weeks (+30.04%) with Pycnogenol® in comparison with lower values (from 20.5 to 23.1 [+12.7%] in controls [P<0.05]). The fingertip skin flux increased significantly (+ 1.55 flux units) with Pycnogenol® (P<0.05), in controls just by +0.14 (ns). Supplementation with Pycnogenol® decreased oxidative stress and increased transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) more than in controls. Compliance and tolerability were optimal. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot registry study suggests that Pycnogenol® may be used with significant advantages in primary, mild RS. Subjects using Pycnogenol® may control their symptoms and may avoid the need for more complex and, potentially dangerous or expensive treatments.",

Pycnogenol® (Horphag Research) is the standardized extract of the bark of Pinus Pinaster. METHODS: During the summer period between June and August 142 patients were split into three groups: 1) Pycnogenol® 150 mg/day; 2) compression stockings; 3) and compression + Pycnogenol®. RESULTS: Venous pressure (ambulatory venous pressure, AVP) and refilling time (RT), microcirculatory and clinical measurements were comparable at inclusion. At 8 weeks variations in skin flux (RF), rate of ankle swelling (RAS), skin PO2-PCO2, Analogue Symptomatic Score (ASLS), Venous Disability and severity Scores and local oxidative stress (OS) indicated a statistically significant improvement by Pycnogenol® both as a single supplement and in association with compression in comparison with baseline. Pycnogenol® significantly improved the microcirculation in comparison with compression (P<0.05). The combined effects of Pycnogenol+compression produced the best results in most measurements. The summer study penalized compression - in a very hot summer - with many drops out. No side effects due to supplementation were observed; tolerability was optimal. The tolerability to stocking was less than optimal (70% of compression not correctly used). Pycnogenol® alone was more effective than compression alone. The increase (P<0.05) in skin O2 and the decrease in PCO2 were associated with the decrease in skin flux. The variations in capillary filtration (RAS) were the most important microcirculation changes. RAS is directly associated with swelling, the hallmark of CVI. Pycnogenol® in both Pycnogenol groups significantly improved RAS in comparison with compression only (P<0.05). The decrease in OS in both Pycnogenol® groups was significant in comparison with compression only (P<0.05). A lower OS is an important micro-metabolic indication of a better capillary bed with better nutritional, perfusional exchanges. The clinical measurements followed the patterns of the microcirculation with the supplement groups performing statistically better (P<0.002) than the compression-only. CONCLUSIONS: This \"summer registry\" study confirms the clinical and microcirculatory efficacy of Pycnogenol in CVI and venous microangiopathy. The study indicates the significant clinical role of Pycnogenol® (both as a single treatment and in association with compression) in the management, treatment and control of this common clinical problem.",

This study aimed to determine the effects of pycnogenol on I/R injury in rat brain tissues. METHODS: Eighteen albino Wistar rats were divided into three groups: I/R injury (IR, n = 6) group; I/R injury + pycnogenol (IR + P, n = 6) group; and sham group (SG, n = 6). After 30 min of transient ischemia, 24 h of reperfusion was achieved in the IR and IR + P groups. Surgical dissection, except for transient ischemia, was performed in SG. Next, histopathological and biochemical investigations were performed on brain tissues. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPO) were analyzed as oxidative stress markers; IL-1β and TNF-α were analyzed as inflammatory stress markers in biochemical tests. RESULTS: Histopathological examination revealed normal morphology in SG and diffuse cortex damage with edema, vasopathology, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the IR group. The IR + P group showed less cortex damage, edema, and vasopathology than the IR group. The MDA, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels were significantly higher in the IR group than those in the SG group. The values of same markers for the IR + P group were significantly lower than the IR group. The GSH and GPO levels were significantly decreased with IR damage, but PYC treatment showed significant improvement in the levels. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the administration of pycnogenol ameliorated brain damage after I/R injury by reducing oxidative and inflammatory damage in the rat brain.",

Pycnogenol® is an anti-inflammatory, anti-edema, mild antiplatelet-antithrombotic agent. METHODS: The registry study evaluated the number of repeated episodes of RVT in 12 months. Possible managements were: standard management (SM); SM + Aspirin (100 mg/once day; if there were no tolerability problems); SM + Pycnogenol (100 mg/day); SM and ticlopidine (200 mg/day); SM + sulodexide (500 ULS/day). The number of subjects age and sex, distribution, the percent of smokers, the vision were comparable at inclusion. RESULTS: 307 subjects completed the study, 44 in the SM group, 90 in the Pycnogenol® group, 90 in the aspirin group, 45 in the ticlopidine group and 38 in the sulodexide group. At 12 months, recurrent RVT was documented in 22.7% of controls (SM), 3.3% of Pycnogenol® subjects (P<0.05 vs. SM; 19.4% difference). There were RVTs in 15.5% subjects using Aspirin (-7.2% vs. SM). Ticlopidine also reduced (P<0.05) the incidence of RVT in comparison with SM (-9.1%). Sulodexide reduced the occurrence of new RVT (-9.5% vs. SM). Edema was better controlled with the supplement than with all other treatments (P<0.05) (edema present in only 5.5% of the Pycnogenol® subjects). Pycnogenol® had a very good tolerability and safety profile (no patient had to stop treatment). CONCLUSIONS: Pycnogenol® is the only product able to control edema and this may reduce the incidence of recurrent RVT. This retrospective registry indicates that Aspirin, Pycnogenol®, ticlopidine an sulodexide reduce recurrent RVT without side effects. Larger studies should be planned to involve a wider range of conditions, diseases and risk factors associated with RVT and to its recurrence.",

In this study, we investigated the prospective effect of Pycnogenol (PYC), an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilator agent, on ESC-induced SDys. METHODS: This was a randomized, parallel, open-label study. Seventy-two outpatients of both genders with depression were randomized into two groups as follows: 37 patients from the ESC + PYC group took 50 mg of PYC per day for 4 months in ESC co-treatment, and 35 subjects from the ESC group took ESC only. Five patients dropped out and were excluded from the analysis. The participants were examined every month (visits 1-4). RESULTS: ESC use led to improvement of depressive symptoms and severity scored by standardized psychiatric tests. PYC co-treatment resulted in attenuation of SDys beginning at 1 month of treatment and continuing for two consecutive months. Furthermore, an increase in heart rate in the PYC group was registered. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that PYC-mediated SDys attenuation is based on its ability to improve endothelial functions by its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and anticoagulant action. We assume that the action of PYC on heart rate is in accordance with the aforementioned vasodilatory action of PYC and consequent baroreflex-mediated heart rate response. PYC co-treatment reduced ESC-induced SDys and elevated heart rate.",

Pycnogenol® (PYC), a plant extract obtained from Pinus pinaster, has been suggested to be effective in many diseases including diabetes, cancer, inflammatory and immune system disorders. The mechanisms underlying the effects of PYC in diabetes need to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of PYC treatment (50 mg/kg/day, orally, for 28 days) on the DNA damage and biochemical changes in the blood, liver, and kidney tissues of experimental diabetic rats. Changes in the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione-S-transferase enzymes, and the levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, total glutathione, malondialdehyde, insulin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and triglyceride were evaluated. DNA damage was also determined in the whole blood cells and the liver and renal tissue cells using the alkaline comet assay. PYC treatment significantly ameliorated the oxidative stress, lipid profile, and liver function parameters as well as DNA damage in the hyperglycemic rats. The results show that PYC treatment might improve the hyperglycemia-induced biochemical and physiological changes in diabetes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is one of the most common and severe brain disorders in the world, characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures due to an imbalance between cerebral excitability and inhibition. Oxidative stress is a biochemical state in which reactive oxygen species are generated and associated with various diseases including epilepsy. Pycnogenol, a polyphenol obtained from the pine tree and has antioxidant & anti-inflammatory activity. So, the aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of Pycnogenol on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice. METHODS: The mice of swiss strain each weighing 18-30g were used. Pycnogenol (50&100mg/kg) was suspended in carboxymethyl cellulose in saline and administered orally. Diazepam (1mg/kg, i.p) was used as a standard drug. The anticonvulsant effects of the drugs were measured using PTZ and cognitive behaviour was also assessed. The biochemical estimation was done by measuring Thiobarbituric acid, Superoxide dismutase, Catalase, and reduced glutathione followed by the histopathological study. RESULT: Pycnogenol 50 & 100mg/kg showed a significant increase in latency to PTZ-induced seizures, decrease in duration and frequency of convulsions compared to control animals; however, the effects were dose-dependent and were more significant at a higher dose. No impairment in cognitive functions like memory and muscle relaxant was observed following pycnogenol 50 & 100 mg/kg. The effect of Pycnogenol on biochemical parameter was found to be significant. It significantly (p<0.01) decreases the level of TBARS and increases the levels of SOD, catalase, and GSH in the brain tissue. The histopathological evaluation showed less neuronal degeneration in the brain due to PTZ-induced seizures in comparison to control group. CONCLUSION: Thus pycnogenol has a protective approach towards convulsion and can be included as an adjuvant therapy with antiepileptic drugs.",

The present study investigated whether Pycnogenol® (PYC), a standardized French maritime pine bark extract, could prevent BPH induced by testosterone propionate (TP) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups of six rats. One group was used as a normal control rats and the other groups received subcutaneous injections of TP for 4 weeks to induce BPH. In the two treatment groups, PYC (20 or 40 mg/kg) was administered daily for 4 weeks by oral gavage concurrently with the induction of TP. All rats were sacrificed at the scheduled termination time, the prostates were weighed, and histopathologic examinations were conducted. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels in serum and the prostate were measured, and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 proteins was investigated. BPH-treated animals showed increases in the relative weight of the prostate, higher concentrations of DHT in serum and the prostate, and higher expression of PCNA and Ki-67 in the prostate; in contrast, PYC-treated animals had significant reductions in these factors compared with the BPH animals. These findings indicated that PYC inhibited the development of BPH and that this was closely associated with a reduction in DHT concentration."

However, the reported results are inconsistent because of varied characteristics of participants and quality of studies. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effect of Pycnogenol supplementation on BP. METHODS: This literature search of PubMed, the Web of Science and the Cochrane library was performed in May 2016 to identify eligible studies. Reference lists of the retrieved articles were also reviewed. Either a fixed-effects or, in the presence of heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used to calculate the effect of combined treatment. RESULTS: We identified nine trials involving 549 participants who received Pycnogenol supplementation ranging from 150 mg/d to 200 mg/d. Compared with the control, the pooled estimate of change in systolic and diastolic BPs were -3.22 mmHg (95% CI: -6.20, -0.24) and -3.11 mmHg (95% CI: -4.60, -1.62), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed higher BP reduction among hypertensive participants or those who received intervention for more than 12 wk. However, this significant reduction was not observed in well-designed trials. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis with nine trials provides better evidence that Pycnogenol exerts beneficial effects on BP."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impairments in cognitive function are difficult to evaluate and measure. In most cases, subjects do not perceive any alteration in their own status, particularly in case of mild cognitive impairment. In case of minimal alterations of cognitive function, no real treatment exists at the moment. Functional and/or temporary alterations in the cerebral microcirculation may be involved in cognitive impairment, and some aspects of MCI may be theoretically caused by perfusional problems. Metabolic problems and sleep disturbances can also be associated to cognitive impairment. Pycnogenol® (Horphag) is a natural compound extracted from the bark of French maritime pine, and it is a highly standardized supplement. The aim of this registry was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with Pycnogenol® over a two-month-period in otherwise healthy individuals with minimal cognitive impairment and initial cognitive dysfunction selected on the basis of their MMSE score. METHODS: Eighty-seven healthy subjects with a MMSE score ranging from 18 to 23 (mild impairment) were included. Their BMI was <26 kg/m2, and no metabolic disorders were present. Participants were divided into two groups: one group was treated with standard management (SM) only (N.=44), whereas the other group received Pycnogenol® supplementation (150 mg/day) in addition to SM (N.=43). RESULTS: In the Pycnogenol® group MMSE score at inclusion was on average 21.64±1.5; after 8 weeks of supplementation, the average MMSE score increased significantly to 25.64±1.4 (P<0.05). In controls, the initial MMSE score was 22.43±1.2, comparable to the supplement group; however, in these subjects it did not show significant improvement after 8 weeks (average after treatment: 23.00±1.3). The median increase was 18% with Pycnogenol® vs. 2.48% in the SM group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pycnogenol® has shown a large number of positive effects in subjects with initial cognitive impairment, due to its effects on oxidative stress levels. The safety and tolerability of Pycnogenol® are good, and thus the supplementation regimen should be tested in larger studies with a longer follow-up.",

Cell protective effect of Pycnogenol® (PYC) depends on its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of PYC on an experimental AC model. METHODS: Ovalbumin and Al(OH)3 were given seven times intraperitoneally (i.p.) every other day and ovalbumin installed everyday directly on conjunctiva to create an AC rat model. Then, PYC (3 or 10 mg/kg i.p.) was applied in the study groups. Control rats were given adjuvant Al(OH)3 i.p. and topical saline on conjunctiva. A negative control group in which only PYC (10 mg/kg/7 days) was administered i.p. and an AC positive control group which have been given dexamethasone (1 mg/kg/7 days) was created. Mast cells were counted with a microscope; histological evaluation was performed with H-E and toluidine blue, mast cell tryptase, and TNF-α and TGF-β staining. RESULTS: Pycnogenol treatment alone did not show any detrimental effect. Mast cell count (MCC) decreased in both dexamethasone and 10 mg/kg given PYC treatment groups compared to positive control group and these results were statistically significant (MCC 1.85 ± 0.69, p < 0.001; 2.42 ± 0.53, p = 0.003). Negative staining with TGF-β and weak focal staining with TNF-α were the common findings of dexamethasone and PYC treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The animal model of AC was successfully developed by using aforementioned way. PYC is a safe herbal product and it has alleviated the findings of ovalbumin-induced AC-similar to dexamethasone-histologically in this experimental model. These results are promising for the future of AC treatment.",

Pycnogenol (PYC), extracted from French maritime pine bark, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and can improve lipid profiles. However, the effect of PYC on obesity has never been explored. In this study, we investigated the effects of PYC on obesity and WAT browning in apolipoprotein E- (ApoE-) deficient mice. The results showed that PYC treatment clearly reversed body weight and the mass of eWAT gain resulting from a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet (HCD), but no difference in food intake. The morphology results showed that the size of the adipocytes in the PYC-treated mice was obviously smaller than that in the HCD-fed mice. Next, we found that PYC upregulated the expression of genes related to lipolysis (ATGL and HSL), while it decreased the mRNA level of PLIN1. PYC significantly increased the expression of UCP1 and other genes related to beige adipogenesis. Additionally, PYC increased the expression of proteins related to the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. The findings suggested that PYC decreased obesity by promoting lipolysis and WAT browning. Thus, PYC may be a novel therapeutic target for obesity.",

Here, we investigated the beneficial effect of PYC on diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient male mice were administered PYC at oral doses of 30 or 100 mg·kg-1·day-1 for 2 wk in advance and were then fed a high-cholesterol and -fat diet (HCD) for 8 wk. Biochemical, immunohistochemical, and gene expression analyses were conducted to explore the effect of PYC on lipid metabolism in ApoE-deficient mice on a HCD. Short-term treatment with HCD in ApoE-deficient mice induced hepatic injuries, such as lipid metabolism disorder and hepatic histopathological changes. We found that PYC reduced body weight and the increase of serum lipids that had been caused by HCD. Supplementation of PYC significantly reduced lipid deposition in the liver, as shown by the lowered hepatic lipid content and histopathological lesions. We subsequently detected genes related to lipid metabolism and inflammatory cytokines. The study showed that PYC markedly suppressed the expression of genes related to hepatic lipogenesis, fatty acid uptake, and lipid storage while increasing the lipolytic gene, which thus reduced hepatic lipid content. Furthermore, PYC mainly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the infiltration of inflammatory cells, which were resistant to the development of hepatic steatosis. These results demonstrate that PYC protects against the occurrence and development of hepatic steatosis and may provide a new prophylactic approach for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The standardized maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol®) has previously shown symptom alleviating effects in patients suffering from moderate forms of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The cellular mechanisms for this positive impact are so far unknown. The purpose of the present randomized pilot controlled study was to span the knowledge gap between the reported clinical effects of Pycnogenol® and its in vivo mechanism of action in OA patients. METHODS: Thirty three patients with severe OA scheduled for a knee arthroplasty either received 100 mg of Pycnogenol® twice daily or no treatment (control group) three weeks before surgery. Cartilage, synovial fluid and serum samples were collected during surgical intervention. Relative gene expression of cartilage homeostasis markers were analyzed in the patients' chondrocytes. Inflammatory and cartilage metabolism mediators were investigated in serum and synovial fluid samples. RESULTS: The oral intake of Pycnogenol® downregulated the gene expression of various cartilage degradation markers in the patients' chondrocytes, the decrease of MMP3, MMP13 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1B were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). Additionally, protein concentrations of ADAMTS-5 in serum were reduced significantly (p ≤ 0.05) after three weeks intake of the pine bark extract. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report about positive cellular effects of a dietary supplement on key catabolic and inflammatory markers in patients with severe OA. The results provide a rational basis for understanding previously reported clinical effects of Pycnogenol® on symptom scores of patients suffering from OA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN10754119 .

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Pycnogenol® (PYC®), a standardized extract from the bark of Pinus maritima, consists of different phenolic compounds. PYC® has shown to have protective effects on chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma, cancer, and immune disorders. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of PYC® against the DNA damage and biochemical changes in blood, liver, and lung tissues of ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sham group, IR injury-induced group, and IR+PYC® group were formed. Ischemia was induced and sustained for 45 min, then the ischemic liver was reperfused, which was sustained for a further 120 min at the end of this period. After anesthesia and before the IR inducement, 100 mg/kg PYC® was given to the IR+PYC® group through intraperitoneal injections. The total oxidant (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS), total thiol levels (TTL), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and biochemical parameters [myeloperoxidase (MPO), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] in the rats were analyzed using spectrophotometric methods and DNA damage was assessed using single-cell gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The levels of TOS, TTL, MPO, AOPP, ALT, AST, and LDH were significantly decreased in the IR+PYC® group compared with the IR group (p<0.05). The levels of TAS were significantly increased in the IR+PYC® group compared with the IR group (p<0.05). PYC® reduced the DNA damage when compared with the IR group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that PYC® treatment might have a role in the prevention of IR-induced oxidative damage by decreasing DNA damage and increasing antioxidant status."

In present study, we explored the effects of Pycnogenol® (PYC, pine bark extract) on pulmonary fibrosis caused by CS+lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. Mice were treated with LPS intranasally on day 12 and 26, followed by CS exposure for 1 h/day (8 cigarettes per day) for 4 weeks. One hour before CS exposure, 10 and 20 mg/kg of PYC were administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. PYC effectively reduced the number of inflammatory cells and proinflammatory mediators caused by CS+LPS exposure in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. PYC inhibited the collagen deposition on lung tissue caused by CS+LPS exposure, as evidenced by Masson's trichrome stain. Furthermore, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression and Smad family member 2/3 (Smad 2/3) phosphorylation were effectively suppressed by PYC treatment. PYC markedly reduced the collagen deposition caused by CS+LPS exposure, which was closely involved in TGF-β1/Smad 2/3 signaling, which is associated with pulmonary fibrotic change. These findings suggest that treatment with PYC could be a therapeutic strategy for controlling COPD progression."

Thirty-three patients with severe osteoarthritis scheduled for a knee arthroplasty were randomized to receive either 200 mg per day Pycnogenol® (P+) or no treatment (Co) over three weeks before surgery. Serum, blood cells, and synovial fluid samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI/MS/MS). Considerable interindividual differences were observed indicating pronounced variability of the polyphenol pharmacokinetics. Notably, the highest polyphenol concentrations were not detected in serum. Catechin and taxifolin primarily resided within the blood cells while the microbial catechin metabolite δ-(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-γ-valerolactone, ferulic, and caffeic acid were mainly present in synovial fluid samples. Taxifolin was detected in serum and synovial fluid exclusively in the P+ group. Likewise, no ferulic acid was found in serum samples of the Co group. Calculating ratios of analyte distribution in individual patients revealed a simultaneous presence of some polyphenols in serum, blood cells, and/or synovial fluid only in the P+ group. This is the first evidence that polyphenols distribute into the synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis which supports rationalizing the results of clinical efficacy studies.",

      "abstract": "Pycnogenol (PYC), an extract of pine bark, is known to have photoprotective, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. An in vivo study was conducted to evaluate the effects of PYC treatment on wound healing in 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, of which 24 were injected with a single dose of alloxan to induce diabetes. Three (3) excisional skin wounds (1.3 cm x 1.3 cm x 2 mm) were created in each healthy and diabetic animal. One (1) wound in each animal was left untreated, 1 was treated daily with a cleanser (ethacridine lactate) and covered with silver sulfadiazine (SSD), and 1 was treated with PYC powder (30 mg). After measuring wound size, 6 animals from both groups were sacrificed on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 and tissue samples were taken for histopathological evaluation of acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue, fibroblast maturation, collagen deposition, epithelialization, and neovascularization using a scoring system of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = abundant. Because the wounds created were not uniform in size within and among the animals, healing was expressed as a percentage of the initial wound size for each animal. Data were compared using 2-way analysis of variance; histopathological lesion scores were reported in median values in univariate analysis, with P <.05 denoting statistical significance. The mean initial wound surface area was 1.69 ± 0.44 cm². On day 21, the average reduction in wound size was lower in diabetic than in healthy rats (47.42% versus 50.91%, P <.0001) and, in both groups combined, the average reduction was 45.73% in untreated, 48.73% in cleanser/SSD-treated, and 58.03% in PYC-treated wounds (P <.0001). Wound size reduction was also significantly different between PYC and the cleanser/SSD treatment depending on the rats' health status (P <.0001): 49.68% and 47.84% using cleanser/SSD and 56.17% and 49.84% using PYC in healthy and diabetic rats, respectively. After 3 weeks, wound size for the healthy rats had decreased more than in the diabetic rats (mean 50.91% versus 47.42%). Although reepithelialization was complete in both groups by day 21, complete neovascularization was evident in the healthy rats but not in the diabetic rats. Overall, compared to the untreated control wounds, treatments with cleanser/SSD and PYC were equally effective in lowering acute and chronic inflammation scores on days 7 and 21. In diabetic rat wounds, collagen deposition and neovascularization scores were higher in wounds treated with PYC than cleanser/SSD-treated wounds (1.5 versus 1.0 and 2.0 versus 1.5, respectively). PYC appears to be a viable option to accelerate wound healing. Further in vivo and human research is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methylphenidate (MPH), the first choice medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is associated with serious adverse effects like arrhythmia. Evidence on the association of ADHD with immune and oxidant-antioxidant imbalances offers potential for antioxidant and/or immunomodulatory nutritional supplements as ADHD therapy. One small randomised trial in ADHD suggests, despite various limitations, therapeutic benefit from Pycnogenol®, a herbal, polyphenol-rich extract. METHODS: This phase III trial is a 10-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo and active treatment controlled multicentre trial with three parallel treatment arms to compare the effect of Pycnogenol® to MPH and placebo on the behaviour of 144 paediatric ADHD and attention-deficit disorder (ADD) patients. Evaluations of behaviour (measured by the ADHD-Rating Scale (primary endpoint) and the Social-emotional Questionnaire (SEQ)), immunity (plasma cytokine and antibody levels, white blood cell counts and faecal microbial composition), oxidative stress (erythrocyte glutathione, plasma lipid-soluble vitamins and malondialdehyde and urinary 8-OHdG levels, as well as antioxidant enzyme activity and gene expression), serum zinc and neuropeptide Y level, urinary catecholamines and physical complaints (Physical Complaints Questionnaire) will be performed in week 10 and compared to baseline. Acceptability evaluations will be based on adherence, dropouts and reports of adverse events. Dietary habits will be taken into account. DISCUSSION: This trial takes into account comorbid behavioural and physical symptoms, as well as a broad range of innovative immune and oxidative biomarkers, expected to provide fundamental knowledge on ADHD aetiology and therapy. Research on microbiota in ADHD is novel. Moreover, the active control arm is rather unseen in research on nutritional supplements, but of great importance, as patients and parents are often concerned with the side effects of MPH.

      "abstract": "This open registry aimed to evaluate the clinical evolution of postpartum varicose veins (VVs), in healthy women after the second pregnancy, how these veins regain shape and competence, and possible treatments. The registry included two groups of women: (1) those who used elastic compression stockings, and (2) who used an oral venotonic agent (Pycnogenol, 100 mg/d). A total of 12 evaluation targets were established. Minor symptoms were scored in an analogue scale line. A visual analogue scale line evaluated the overall satisfaction relative to elastic compression or Pycnogenol. Overall 133 women completed the registry evaluation with at least 3 months of follow-up. The resulting two registry groups were comparable. At 3 and 6 months in the Pycnogenol group the number of veins and incompetent sites were lower. At 6 months there were 13.3% of patients with edema in controls versus 3.2% in the Pycnogenol group. Spider veins decreased in Pycnogenol patients. Cramps and other minor symptoms were less common in the Pycnogenol group. In both groups there was a significant improvement at 6 months with better results in the Pycnogenol group. The need for treatment was limited with a decreased need for sclerotherapy, surgery, and conservative treatments in the Pycnogenol group. The overall satisfaction was higher among Pycnogenol patients, and compliance was optimal. Re-evaluation at 12 months indicated that the variations in VVs and spider vein clusters and the associated symptoms did not change. Most remodeling appeared to happen within 6 months after the pregnancy. It was concluded that the use of Pycnogenol improves signs/symptoms of postpartum VVs, and venous function and shape seem to return faster to prepartum, physiological pattern with its use."

However, the in vivo effects on allergic inflammation have not been identified to date. AIMS: To investigate the treatment results of PYC on allergic inflammation in a rat model of allergic rhinitis. STUDY DESIGN: Animal experimentation. METHODS: Allergic rhinitis was stimulated in 42 rats by intraperitoneal sensitization and intranasal challenge with Ovalbumin. The animals were divided into six subgroups: healthy controls, AR group, AR group treated with corticosteroid (dexamethasone 1 mg/kg; CS+AR), healthy rats group that were given only PYC of 10 mg/kg (PYC10), AR group treated with PYC of 3mg/kg (PYC3+AR), and AR group treated with PYC of 10 mg/kg (PYC10+AR). Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (Ig-E) levels of serum were measured. Histopathological changes in nasal mucosa and expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β were evaluated. RESULTS: The levels of the IL-4 were significantly decreased in the PYC3+AR, PYC10+AR and CS+AR groups compared with the AR group (p=0.002, p<0.001, p=0.006). The production of the IFN-γ was significantly decreased in the PYC3+AR and PYC10+AR groups compared with the AR group (p=0.013, p=0.001). The administration of PYC to allergic rats suppressed the elevated IL-10 production, especially in the PYC3+AR group (p=0.006). Mucosal edema was significantly decreased respectively after treatment at dose 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg PYC (both, p<0.001). The mucosal expression of TNF-α has significantly decreased in the PYC3+AR and PYC10+AR groups (p=0.005, p<0.001), while the IL-1β expression significantly decreased in the CS+AR, PYC3+AR, and PYC10+AR groups (p<0.001, p=0.003, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: PYC has multiple suppressive effects on allergic response. Thus, PYC may be used as a supplementary agent in allergic response."

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and molecular mechanism of PYC on regulation of asthmatic airway inflammation. We found that PYC with tail intravenous injection of 50 mg/kg or intragastric administration of 100 mg/kg all reduced ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway injury. Pharmacokinetics of PYC was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography assay, indicating that PYC was quickly absorbed into the blood after intragastric administration, and PYC metabolism was later improved gradually with increase of time after PYC administration. PYC has a higher bioavailability of 71.96%, and it was more easily absorbed by the body. PYC inhibited the number of total inflammatory cells and levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of OVA-induced mice. PYC inhibited IL-13 secretion from the Th2 cells, thereby causing a reduction in expression of the signaling molecules in JAK/STAT6 pathway in airway epithelial cells. STAT6 silence suppressed IL-13-increased acetylcholine level. STAT6 overexpression promoted expression of goblet cell metaplasia-associated molecules (FOXA3, SPDEF, and Muc5ac). PYC suppressed OVA-induced expression of FOXA3, SPDEF, and Muc5ac in lung. Our findings indicate that PYC has a higher bioavailability and it prevents emergence of OVA-induced airway injury and airway inflammation in mice by inhibiting IL-13/JAK/STAT6 pathway and blocking release of acetylcholine to reduce goblet cell metaplasia.",

Adult Sprague-Dawley rats received a CCI injury followed by an intraperitoneal injection of PYC (50 or 100mg/kg). Seven days post trauma, subjects were evaluated in a Morris water maze (MWM) and evaluated for changes in lesion volume. Some animals were evaluated at 48h for hippocampal Fluoro-jade B (FJB) staining. The highest dose of PYC therapy significantly reduced lesion volume, with no improvement in MWM compared to vehicle controls. PYC failed to reduce the total number of FJB positive neurons in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the reduction of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are not the key components of the secondary injury that contribute to cognitive deficits following TBI.",

      "abstract": "Pycnogenol (PYC) is an extract from French maritime pine bark. Its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects have been shown to be beneficial for atherosclerosis. Here, we tested whether PYC could suppress high cholesterol and fat diet (HCD)-induced atherosclerosis formation in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice. In our study, PYC suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced lipid accumulation in peritoneal macrophages. Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were orally administered PYC or a control solvent for ten weeks, and these mice were fed a standard diet or high cholesterol and fat diet during the latter eight weeks. Pycnogenol markedly decreased the size of atherosclerotic lesions induced by high cholesterol and fat diet compared with the nontreated controls. In addition, TLR4 expression in aortic sinus was stimulated by high cholesterol and fat diet feeding and was significantly reduced by PYC. A mechanistic analysis indicated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased expression of fatty acid binding protein (aP2) and macrophage scavenger receptor class A (SR-A), which were blocked by a JNK inhibitor. Furthermore, PYC inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of aP2 and scavenger receptor class A via the JNK pathway. In conclusion, PYC administration effectively attenuates atherosclerosis through the TLR4-JNK pathway. Our results suggest that PYC could be a potential prophylaxis or treatment for atherosclerosis in humans.",

AIM OF THE STUDY: This study evaluates the ability of PYC to inhibit chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-stimulated human airway epithelial cell line NCI-H292 and in a cigarette smoke (CS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model. METHODS: To induce COPD, the mice intranasally received LPS on day 4 and were exposed to CS for 1h per day (total eight cigarettes per day) from days 1-7. The mice were administered PYC at a dose of 15mg/kg and 30mg/kg 1h before CS exposure. RESULTS: In the CSE-stimulated NCI-H292 cells, PYC significantly inhibited Erk phosphorylation, sp1 expression, MUC5AC, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in a concentration-dependent manner, as evidenced by a reduction in their mRNA levels. Co-treatment with PYC and Erk inhibitors markedly reduced the levels inflammatory mediators compared to only PYC-treatment. In the COPD mice model, PYC decreased the inflammatory cell count and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid compared with COPD mice. PYC attenuated the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the airways and decreased the expression levels of Erk phosphorylation and sp1. PYC also inhibited the expression of myeloperoxidase and matrix metalloproteinases-9 in lung tissue. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that PYC inhibited the reduction in the inflammatory response in CSE-stimulated NCI-H292 cells and the COPD mouse model via the Erk-sp1 pathway. Therefore, we suggest that PYC has the potential to treat COPD.",

The oral administration of diosmin/hesperidin has been used as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of pycnogenol and diosmin/hesperidin on the healing of venous ulcers. METHODS: This longitudinal, prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted with 30 adult patients with venous ulcers from a vascular surgery outpatient clinic of a university hospital. The patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups: Group 1 (n = 15) was treated with pycnogenol (50 mg orally, 3 times daily) and Group 2 (n = 15) was treated with diosmin/hesperidin (450/50 mg orally, twice daily). They were assessed every 15 days for 90 days. During follow-up visits, photo-documentation was obtained and the ulcer area and circumference of the affected limb were measured. Friedman's test and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare ulcer areas and circumference of affected limbs between and within groups at different time points. The level of significance was set at 5% (P < 0.05) for all tests. RESULTS: Both the pycnogenol and diosmin/hesperidin treatments had a similar effect on the healing of venous ulcers and led to a significant decrease in the circumference of affected limbs (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that pycnogenol has an adjuvant effect on the healing of venous ulcers, similar to diosmin/hesperidin.",

Several natural antioxidants were found to be effective against drug-induced toxicity. We evaluated the possible protective effects of spirulina and pycnogenol alone or in combination on vancomycin-induced renal cortical oxidative stress. Forty-nine rats were randomly divided into 7 groups: group I, control; group II, received spirulina 1000 mg/kg per day; group III, received pycnogenol 200 mg/kg per day; group IV, received vancomycin 200 mg/kg per day every 12 h; group V, (spirulina + vancomycin); group VI, (pycnogenol + vancomycin); and group VII, (pycnogenol + spirulina + vancomycin). At the end of the experiment, kidney functions were estimated and then the kidneys were removed, weighed, and sampled for histopathological, immunohistochemistry, and biochemical studies. Administration of spirulina and pycnogenol alone or in combination decreased elevated serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, renal malondialdehyde, and immunoexpression of the proapoptotic protein (Bax), autophagic marker protein (LC3/B), and inducible nitric oxide synthase induced by vancomycin. They increased reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and immunoexpression of the antiapoptotic protein (Bcl2). They also ameliorated the morphological changes induced by vancomycin. The combination therapy of spirulina and pycnogenol showed better protective effects than the corresponding monotherapy.",

Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) is an antineoplastic agent. However, its serious side effects such as ototoxicity limit its usage. OBJECTIVE: Antioxidants can be used to prevent ototoxicity. We investigated the effect of Pycnogenol® on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to four groups of five. Distortion product-evoked otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) test was performed for each rat. The experimental groups were as follows: Control Group, Pycnogenol® Group: 10 mg/kg Pycnogenol® intraperitoneally for 7 days, Cisplatin Group: intraperitoneally 15 mg/kg single injection of cisplatin on the fifth day, Cisplatin + Pycnogenol® Group: intraperitoneally 10 mg/kg Pycnogenol® treatment for 7 days, additionally on the fifth day, 15 mg/kg single injection of cisplatin was given. On the eighth day, DPOAE was re-performed and rats were sacrificed. Apoptosis was evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS: Mean percentage of apoptotic cells was 1.5, 3, 30 and 11% in organ of Corti and 2, 2, 40, 15% in spiral ganglion neurons in Control Group, Pycnogenol® Group, Cisplatin Group and Cisplatin + Pycnogenol® Group, respectively. Cisplatin Group and Cisplatin + Pycnogenol® Group were significantly different when compared to Control Group histopathologically both in organ of Corti and spiral ganglion neuron (p <0.001, p = 0.019, p = 0.001, p = 0.015). DPOAE results showed that Cisplatin + Pycnogenol® Group was significantly different when compared to Cisplatin Group at 3, 6 and 8 kHz (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pycnogenol protected against cisplatin ototoxicity. Also, pycnogenol is not ototoxic.",

Pycnogenol significantly inhibited the viability of HSC-3 cells and suppressed neoplastic cell transformation in HSC-3 cells and TPA-treated JB6 cells. It caused caspase-dependent apoptosis evidenced by the increase in cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase 3 in a dose-dependent manner. Pycnogenol increased Bak protein by enhancing its protein stability whereas other Bcl-2 family members were not altered. In addition, the treatment with pycnogenol led to the production of reactive oxygen species and N-acetyl-l-cysteine almost blocked pycnogenol-induced reactive oxygen species generation. Taken together, these findings suggest that pycnogenol may be a potential candidate for the chemoprevention or chemotherapy of human oral cancer."

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death worldwide and is characterized by lipid-laden foam cell formation. Recently, pycnogenol (PYC) has drawn much attention because of its prominent effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, its protective effect against atherosclerosis and the underlying mechanism remains undefined. Here PYC treatment reduced areas of plaque and lipid deposition in atherosclerotic mice, concomitant with decreases in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increases in HDL cholesterol levels, indicating a potential antiatherosclerotic effect of PYC through the regulation of lipid levels. Additionally, PYC preconditioning markedly decreased foam cell formation and lipid accumulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human THP-1 monocytes. A mechanistic analysis indicated that PYC decreased the lipid-related protein expression of adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) and adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP/aP2) in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis confirmed that PYC attenuated LPS-induced lipid droplet formation via ADRP and ALBP expression through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, because pretreatment with anti-TLR4 antibody or a specific inhibitor of NF-κB (PDTC) strikingly mitigated the LPS-induced increase in ADRP and ALBP. Together, our results provide insight into the ability of PYC to attenuate bacterial infection-triggered pathological processes associated with atherosclerosis. Thus PYC may be a potential lead compound for the future development of antiatherosclerotic CVD therapy.",

A total of forty-seven adult males with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia syndrome (OAT) were eligible for enrollment. The effectiveness of supplementation with a combination of L-arginine 690 mg and French maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol(®)) 60mg for OAT and ED was investigated. The sperm concentration was enhanced significantly after treatment 2 and 4 months (11.79 ± 9.86 to 21.22 ± 28.17 and 20.15 ± 23.99 × 106/ml). Significant improvements in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) were observed in the total score of IIEF (57.69 ± 11.04 to 59.43 ± 12.57) and domain of Orgasmic Function (9.01 ± 1.92 to 9.34 ± 1.66) after 4 months of treatment. L-arginine acts to increase the production of nitric oxide and Pycnogenol(®) activates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase and it is a potent antioxidant and inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Pycnogenol(®) on bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular microarchitecture and bone metabolism in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 3 groups: SHAM group (sham-operated rats), OVX group (OVX rats), and treatment group (OVX rats supplemented with 40 mg/kg Pycnogenol(®) by oral gavage). Serum levels of procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and minerals were detected at the end of 9 weeks of gavage. Deoxypyridinoline/creatinine (DPYD/Cr) and N-telopeptide of type I collagen/creatinine (NTX/Cr) rate in urine were also calculated. Left femora were collected for BMD determination, and the right distal femora were made into undecalcified specimens for histomorphometry analysis. RESULTS: At the end of study, PINP level, DPYD/Cr and NTX/Cr rate were significantly increased, and femoral BMD were dramatically decreased in OVX group compared with SHAM group (P < 0.01) while serum minerals and ALP concentrations showed no significant difference. The treatment group had dramatically decreased biomarkers and increased BMD than OVX group (P < 0.01). Histomorphometry analysis showed worse bone microarchitecture parameters in the OVX group compared with the SHAM group which were significantly improved in the treatment group compared with the OVX group (P < 0.01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Pycnogenol(®) (40 mg/kg) can inhibit aggravated bone resorption, prevent BMD loss, and restore the impaired trabecular microarchitecture in OVX rats after 9-week-intervention."

Pycnogenol is a patented extract from French maritime pine bark (Pinus pinaster Aiton) with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potency. The present study investigated whether pycnogenol may be associated with the production of proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 (mouse-derived) microglia. It was found that pycnogenol treatment was dose-dependently associated with significantly less release of nitricoxide (NO), TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, and lower levels of intercellular adhesion molecule1 (ICAM-1) and perilipin 2 (PLIN2). Furthermore, this effect was replicated in primary brain microglia. Levels of inducible NO synthase mRNA and protein were attenuated, whereas there was no change in the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Further evidence indicated that pycnogenol treatment led to the suppression of NF-κB activation through inhibition of p65 translocation into the nucleus and inhibited DNA binding of AP-1, suggesting that these proinflammatory factors are associated with NF-κB and AP-1. We conclude that pycnogenol exerts anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of the NF-κB and AP-1pathway, and may be useful as a therapeutic agent in the prevention of diseases caused by over activation of microglia.",

However, there are still no efficient drugs to cure the disease. Pycnogenol (PYC) isolated from the procyanidin-rich French maritime pine (Pinus maritime) bark has shown various antioxidant activities in previous studies. In this study, we explored its effect against rotenone (Rot)-induced neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms in PC12 cells. Using Rot-induced cell model of PD, we found that PYC treatment significantly increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis in Rot-treated PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, data showed that PYC markedly reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-nitric oxide (NO) signaling in Rot-treated PC12 cells. Pretreatment with the iNOS-specific inhibitor significantly attenuated Rot-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, PYC was found to be capable of reducing Rot-induced NF-κB activation. Blocking NF-κB signaling with its inhibitor mimicked the biological effect of PYC on Rot-induced iNOS and NO expression levels, as well as neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, suggesting that the NF-κB-iNOS signaling pathway was likely to participate in the PYC-mediated protective progress. Our results suggest that PYC protects against Rot-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, and the mechanism may be associated with the downregulation of NF-κB-iNOS signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During mechanical ventilation, high end-inspiratory lung volume results in a permeability type pulmonary oedema, called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The pathophysiology of ventilator-induced lung injury involves multiple mechanisms, such as excessive inflammation. And pycnogenol is a mixture of flavonoid compounds extracted from pine tree bark that have anti-inflammatory activity. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of pyncogenol on ventilator-induced lung injury in rats. METHODS: Rats were orally administrated with pycnogenol once (30 mg/kg) 2 days before lung injury induction with mechanical ventilation, then the rats were divided into three groups: lung-protective ventilation (LV group, n = 20), injurious ventilation (HV group, n = 20), HV + pycnogenol group (HV + Pyc group, n = 20). Lung specimens and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were isolated for histopathological examinations and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: Pretreatment with pycnogenol could markedly decrease lung wet/dry ratio, lower myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and total protein concentration and reduce the production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and MIP-2 in the BALF in ventilator-induced lung injury rats. Additionally, pycnogenol improved the histology of the lung and significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and the degradation of IκB-α. CONCLUSION: Pycnogenol treatment could attenuate ventilator-induced lung injury in rats, at least in part, through its ability to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB, indicating it as a potential therapeutic candidate for ventilator-induced lung injury."

Pycnogenol® is a French maritime pine bark extract produced from the outer bark of Pinus pinaster Ait. Subsp. atlantica. Its strong antioxidant, antiinflammatory, endothelium-dependent vasodilator activity, and also its anti-thrombotic effects make it appropriate for targeting the multifaceted pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. Clinical studies have shown that it can reduce blood glucose levels in people with diabetes, blood pressure in mild to moderate hypertensive patients, and waist circumference, and improve lipid profile, renal and endothelial functions in metabolic syndrome. This review highlights the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome and related clinical research findings on the safety and efficacy of Pycnogenol®. The results of clinical research studies performed with Pycnogenol® are discussed using an evidence-based, target-oriented approach following the pathophysiology of individual components as well as in metabolic syndrome overall.",

      "abstract": "Complete surgical resection with clear margins remains the mainstay of therapy for localised fibrosarcomas. Nevertheless, metastatic fibrosarcomas still represent a therapeutic dilemma. Commonly used chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin have proven to be effective in <30% of all cases of disseminated fibrosarcoma. Especially elderly patients with cardiac subdisease are not suitable for systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin. Therefore we tested the apoptotic effects of the well-tolerated pine bark extract pycnogenol and its constituents on human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080). Ten healthy subjects (six females, four males, mean age 24.8 ± 6 years) received a single dose of 300 mg pycnogenol orally. Blood plasma samples were obtained before and 6 h after intake of pycnogenol. HT1080 cells were treated with these plasma samples. Additionally, HT1080 were incubated separately with catechin, epicatechin and taxifolin that are known as the main constituents of pycnogenol. Vital, apoptotic and necrotic cells were quantified using flow cytometric analysis. Gene expression was analyzed by RNA microarray. The results showed that single application of taxifolin, catechin and epicatechin reduced cell viability of HT1080 cells only moderately. A single dose of 300 mg pycnogenol given to 10 healthy adults produced plasma samples that led to significant apoptotic cell death ex vivo whereas pycnogenol-negative serum displayed no apoptotic activity. Microarray analysis revealed remarkable expression changes induced by pycnogenol in a variety of genes, which are involved in different apoptotic pathways of cancer cells [Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), DUSP1, RHOA, laminin γ1 (LAMC1), fibronectin 1 (FN1), catenin α1 (CTNNA1), ITGB1]. In conclusion, metabolised pycnogenol induces apoptosis in human fibrosarcoma cells. Pycnogenol exhibits its pro-apoptotic activity as a mixture and is more effective than its main constituents catechin, epicatechin and taxifolin indicating that the metabolised components interact synergistically. These results provide experimental support for in vivo trials assessing the effect of the pine bark extract pycnogenol.",

RESULTS: Pycnogenol significantly decreased cell viability and also induced caspase-independent apoptosis. We confirmed that pycnogenol induced the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor into nucleus and regulated apoptosis. Also, Bak protein stability was partly enhanced by pycnogenol to elevate the expression level of Bak protein. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, pycnogenol may be a fascinating therapeutic drug candidate for the treatment of MEC."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Menstrual symptoms such as dysmenorrhea usually occur during the hormone-free interval in oral contraceptive users. Progestin withdrawal activates NF-κB transcription factor, which upregulates both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Cox-2 expression in the endometrium. The use of natural NF-κB inhibitors such as pycnogenol may block this response, improving dysmenorrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with severe dysmenorrhea were allocated to one of two treatment groups. In Group A (n=13), women were treated with an oral contraceptive containing 15 μg of ethinyl estradiol and 60 mg of gestodene (Adoless(®)) in a 24/4 regimen for three consecutive cycles. Women in Group B (n=11) used the same contraceptive regimen together with 100 mg of pycnogenol (Flebon(®)) continuously for 3 months. Pain scores were graded using a visual analog scale (VAS) before and during the hormone-free interval at the end of the third treatment cycle. RESULTS: Before treatment, VAS pain scores for dysmenorrhea were 8 and 9 in Groups A and B, respectively. However, by the end of the third treatment cycle, pain scores had decreased significantly (P<0.05) both in groups A and B. The final pain scores were 6 in Group A and 2 in Group B, a difference that was statistically significant (P<0.0001). In Group B, 27% of the patients became pain-free, while in Group A, none of the women reported complete disappearance of this symptom. The number of bleeding days was also lower in Group B. DISCUSSION: Pycnogenol effectively decreased pain scores and the number of bleeding days when administered concomitantly with a low-dose 24/4 oral contraceptive containing gestodene."

METHODS: This was an observational pilot, substudy of the San Valentino epidemiological cardiovascular study. The study included 824 subjects aged 45-60 without any conventional risk factors who had a stenosing atherosclerotic plaque (>50-60%) in at least one carotid or common femoral bifurcation, allocated into 6 groups: Group 1 (Controls): management was based on education, exercise, diet and lifestyle changes. This same management plan was used in all other groups; group 2: Pycnogenol® 50 mg/day; group 3: Pycnogenol® 100 mg/day; group 4: Aspirin® 100 mg/day or ticlopidine 250 mg/day if intolerant to aspirin; group 5: Aspirin® 100 mg/day and Pycnogenol® 100 mg/day; group 6: Pycnogenol® 100 mg/day plus TTFCA 100 mg/day. The follow-up lasted 42 months. Plaque progression was assessed using the ultrasonic arterial score based on the arterial wall morphology and the number of plaques that progressed and on the number of subjects that had cardiovascular events. A secondary endpoint was to evaluate the changes in oxidative stress at baseline and at 42 months. RESULTS: The ultrasonic score increased significantly in groups 1, 2, and 4 (>1%) but not in groups 3, 5 and 6 (<1%) suggesting a beneficial effect of Pycnogenol® 100 mg. Considering the percent of patients that progressed from class V (asymptomatic) to VI (symptomatic) there was a progression of plaques in 48.09% of controls. In the Pycnogenol® 100 (group 3, 10.4%) and in the Aspirin®+ Pycnogenol® (group 5, 10.68%) progression was half of what observed with antiplatelet agent (group 4, 20.93%); in the TTFCA+ Pycnogenol®group (group 6) progression was 7.4 times lower than in controls; 3.22 times lower than in the antiplatelet agents group (4). Events (hospital admission, specialized care) were observed in 16.03% of controls; there were 8.83% of subjects with events with Pycnogenol® 50 mg and 8% in group 3 (Pycnogenol® 100 mg). In group 4 (antiplatelets), 8.52% of subjects had events; in group 5, 6.87% of subjects had events and in group 6 (TTFCA+ Pycnogenol®) only 4.41% had events (this was the lowest event rate; P<0.05). All treatment groups had a significantly lower event rate (P<0.05) in comparison with controls. Considering treatments groups 2, 3, 5, 6 had a lower number (P<0.05) of subjects in need of cardiovascular management in comparison with controls. The need for risk factor management was higher in controls and lower in group 6 (P<0.05). In groups 2 to 6 the need for risk factor management was lower than in controls (P<0.05). Including all events (hospital admission, need for treatment or for risk management) 51.9% of controls were involved. In the other groups there was a reduction (from a -9.28% reduction in group 2 to a -26% in group 6) (P<0.002). The most important reduction (higher that in all groups; P<0.05) was in group 6. At 42 months, oxidative stress in all the Pycnogenol® groups was less than in the control group. In the combined group of Pycnogenol® and TTFCA the oxidative stress was less than with Pycnogenol® alone (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Pycnogenol® and the combination of Pycnogenol® +TTFCA appear to reduce the progression of subclinical arterial plaques and the progression to clinical stages. The reduction in plaque and clinical progression was associated with a reduction in oxidative stress. The results justify a large, randomized, controlled study to demonstrate the efficacy of the combined Pycnogenol® and TTFCA prophylactic therapy in preclinical atherosclerosis.",

In the last decade, the current standard HCV treatment, pegylated interferon and ribavirin, have limited efficacy and significant side effects. Novel direct acting antivirals show promise, but escape mutants are expected, along with potential side effects. Pycnogenol®, a French maritime pine extract, has been reported to have antioxidant and antiviral effects. Here, we evaluated the effect of Pycnogenol® on HCV replication. Wild-type and protease inhibitor (VX-950; telaprevir)-resistant HCV replicon cells were treated with Pycnogenol®, Pycnogenol® and interferon-alpha, and ribavirin and telaprevir. Pycnogenol® effects on replication were also evaluated in HCV-infected chimeric mice. Pycnogenol® treatment showed antiviral effects without cytotoxicity at doses up to 50 μg/mL. Pycnogenol® in combination with interferon-alpha or ribavirin showed synergistic effects. Moreover, Pycnogenol® inhibited HCV replication in telaprevir-resistant replicon cells; telaprevir and Pycnogenol® acted additively to reduce HCV RNA levels in wild-type HCV replicon cells without significantly increasing cytotoxicity. Pycnogenol® antiviral activity was higher than its components procyanidin and taxifolin. Further, treatment of infected chimeric mice with Pycnogenol® suppressed HCV replication and showed a synergistic effect with interferon-alpha. In addition, Pycnogenol® treatment resulted in dose-dependent reduction of reactive oxygen species in HCV replicon cell lines. Pycnogenol® is a natural product that may be used to improve the efficacy of the current standard antiviral agents and even to eliminate resistant HCV mutants.",

We examined the inhibitory effects of PYC on alveolar bone resorption, which is a characteristic feature of periodontitis, induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and osteoclast differentiation. In rat periodontitis model, rats were divided into four groups: group A served as the non-infected control, group B was infected orally with P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, group C was administered PYC in the diet (0.025%: w/w), and group D was infected with P. gingivalis and administered PYC. Administration of PYC along with P. gingivalis infection significantly reduced alveolar bone resorption. Treatment of P. gingivalis with 1 µg/ml PYC reduced the number of viable bacterial cells. Addition of PYC to epithelial cells inhibited adhesion and invasion by P. gingivalis. The effect of PYC on osteoclast formation was confirmed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. PYC treatment significantly inhibited osteoclast formation. Addition of PYC (1-100 µg/ml) to purified osteoclasts culture induced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that PYC may prevent alveolar bone resorption through its antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis and by suppressing osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, PYC may be useful as a therapeutic and preventative agent for bone diseases such as periodontitis.",

Rats were treated with 100 mg/kg intraperitonally Pyc following the induction of sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture. The decreases in MDA levels and increases in GSH levels, and SOD and GPx activities were observed in the livers and kidneys of Pyc-treated septic rats. Plasma TNF-α level was found to be decreased in the Pyc-treated septic rats. In the lymphocytes, kidney, and liver tissue cells of the sepsis-induced rats, Pyc treatment significantly decreased the DNA damage and oxidative base damage using standard alkaline assay and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase-modified comet assay, respectively.

      "abstract": "AIM: The aim of the study was the evaluation of supplementation with Pycnogenol®, French maritime pine bark extract (registered trademark of Horphag Research Ltd.) to improve the effects of the management of psoriasis and reduce the need for treatments. METHODS: Patients (age range 30-45) with moderate/severe plaque psoriasis were included in a 12-week registry study that did not interfere with 'standard management'. The minimum Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score at inclusion was 10. Subjects with 10-29% (grade 2) and 30-49% (grade 3) of involved area were included. Oxidative stress (plasma free radicals) was measured. Patient-reported measures included the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The supplement was used at a dosage of 150 mg/day (50 mg three times daily). RESULTS: The two registry groups (standard management and standard management+supplementation) were comparable. Dropouts were due to logistical problems. Single PASI items were evaluated: a decrease in the affected body area in boths groups was observed. The decrease in affected areas was more pronounced in the Pycnogenol group in all body regions. The severity score (erythema, induration, desquamation) improved more significantly with Pycnogenol. Considering the water content of skin in all areas, the increase was higher with Pycnogenol. The quantity of exfoliating cells (score from -5 to +5) was significantly reduced in both groups, with a better action using Pycnogenol. Skin moisture improved with treatment in all subjects, with better effects using Pycnogenol. Using a modified (12 items) DLQI indicating how much psoriasis had affected the patient's life in the previous week, Pycnogenol-supplemented subjects performed better for each single parameter in comparison with standard management. Improvement in the treatment time (-32% in comparison with standard management) and costs (decreased on average 36.4% in comparison with standard management) were observed in the supplement group. A decrease in consumption of other drugs was observed with the supplement. Oxidative stress was significantly lower in the supplement group at 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the efficacy of Pycnogenol supplementation in improving control of the most common clinical aspects of psoriasis and in reducing oxidative stress. Further studies may indicate the possible systemic or local use of Pycnogenol and its role in controlling side effects and costs of standard management.",

METHODS: This was an observational pilot substudy of the San Valentino epidemiological cardiovascular study. The study included 1363 subjects aged 45-60 without any conventional risk factors who had non stenosing atherosclerotic plaques (<50%) in at least one carotid or common femoral bifurcation, allocated into 6 groups: Group 1 (CONTROLS): management was based on education, exercise, diet and lifestyle changes. This same management plan was used in all groups; Group 2 Pycnogenol 50 mg/day; Group 3 Pycnogenol 100 mg/day; Group 4 Aspirin 100 mg/day or Ticlopidine 250 mg/day if intolerant to aspirin; Group 5 Aspirin 100 mg/day and Pycnogenol 100 mg/day; Group 6 Pycnogenol 100 mg/day plus TECA (total triterpenic fraction of Centella Asiatica) 100 mg/day. There was a six monthly follow-up up to 30 months. Plaque progression was assessed using the ultrasonic arterial score based on the arterial wall morphology and the number of plaques that progressed from the non-stenotic to the stenotic group. A secondary endpoint was to evaluate the changes in oxidative stress at baseline and at 30 months. RESULTS: The ultrasonic score increased significantly in groups 1, 2 and 4 but not in groups 3, 5 and 6 suggesting a beneficial effect of Pycnogenol 100 mg. The percentage of plaques that progressed from class IV to class V was 8.4% in group 2, 5.3% in group 3, 4% in group 5 and 1.1% in group 6 (P<0.0001) compared with 16.6% in group 4 (aspirin) and 21.3% in the control group suggesting a beneficial effect of Pycnogenol. The lowest rate of progression was in group 6 (Pycnogenol plus TECA). At 30 months, the oxidative stress in all the Pycnogenol groups was less than in the control group. The oxidative stress was lower in the Pycnogenol 100 mg group than the Pycnogenol 50 mg group (P<0.0001). In the combined group of Pycnogenol and TECA the oxidative stress was less than the Pycnogenol alone (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Pycnogenol and the combination of Pycnogenol+TECA appear to reduce the progression of subclinical arterial lesions in low-risk asymptomatic subjects. The reduction in plaque progression was associated with a reduction in oxidative stress. The results justify a large randomized controlled study to demonstrate the efficacy of the combined Pycnogenol and TECA prophylactic therapy in subclinical atherosclerosis.",

Supplementation of Pyc at 30 mg/kg significantly reduced body weight gain and visceral fat mass. The serum and hepatic triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels were reduced by Pyc supplementation, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level significantly increased. In addition, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) mRNA levels increased with Pyc supplementation in adipose tissue of ob/ob mice. The treatment of primary cultured adipocytes with Pyc at 100 μg/mL significantly increased glycerol release, cAMP level by reduction of phosphodiestersae-3B (PDE3B), and HSL levels, but decreased protein levels of perilipin A and fatty acid synthetase (FAS). The PKA inhibitor (H89) clearly blocked the cellular levels of perilipin A and HSL, suggesting that Pyc promotes lipolysis of adipocytes through activation of cAMP-dependent PKA, resulting in induction of HSL and reduction of perilipin A. Therefore, this study may elucidate the possible mechanism of Pyc, which is a candidate for weight loss through stimulation of lipolysis.",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of PYC on airway inflammation using a model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma and RAW264.7 cells. PYC decreased nitric oxide production and reduced the interleukine (IL)-1β and IL-6 levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. PYC also reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and enhanced the expression of hemeoxygenase (HO)-1. In the in vivo experiment, PYC decreased the inflammatory cell count and the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and immunoglobulin (Ig) E in BALF or serum. These results are consistent with the histological analysis findings, which showed that PYC attenuated the airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion induced by OVA challenge. In addition, PYC enhanced the expression of HO-1. In contrast, PYC inhibited the elevated expression of iNOS and MMP-9 proteins induced by OVA challenge. In conclusion, PYC exhibits protective effects against OVA-induced asthma and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest that PYC has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic asthma.",

METHODS: A group of 78 smokers were supplemented with 50 mg Pycnogenol over an eight-week period, followed by two weeks cessation. Another 77 smokers took placebo tablets. Plasma reactive oxygen metabolites were detected by d-ROM test and the biological antioxidant potential (BAP) was quantified by photometric analysis of ferric iron reduction to ferrous form. RESULTS: BAP and d-ROM values in the Pycnogenol and placebo group were comparative at trial start. Pycnogenol lowered d-ROM values by 25.3% from baseline 459.4±65 to 342.2±56 Carr units after 2 weeks. At time points 4, 5 and 8 weeks treatment d-ROM values in the Pycnogenol group were significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). After cessation of Pycnogenol from week 8 to 10 d-ROM values increased from 288.4±32 to 381.3±39 Carr units. BAP values increased in the Pycnogenol group from baseline 1698±231 to 2349±294 μM after 8 weeks and dropped to 2002±203 μM after two weeks washout period. Values in the control group remained largely unaltered with 1669±311, 1673±229 and 1656±221 μM, at 0, 8 and 10 weeks, respectively.

Pycnogenol is a French maritime pine bark extract produced from the outer bark of Pinus pinaster Ait. subsp. atlantica. Its strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and vasodilator activities, antithrombotic effects and collagen stabilizing properties make it uniquely able to target the multi facet pathophysiology of CVI and related venous disorders. Clinical studies have shown that it can reduce oedema of the legs in CVI, reduce the incidence of deep venous thrombosis during long haul flights and enhance the healing of venous ulcers and haemorrhoidal episodes by topical application and/or oral administration. This review highlights clinical research findings on the safety, compliance and efficacy of Pycnogenol, including its use in combination products.",

      "abstract": "After traumatic brain injury (TBI), both primary and secondary injury cascades are initiated, leading to neuronal death and cognitive dysfunction. We have previously shown that the combinational bioflavonoid, Pycnogenol (PYC), alters some secondary injury cascades and protects synaptic proteins when administered immediately following trauma. The purpose of the present study was to explore further the beneficial effects of PYC and to test whether it can be used in a more clinically relevant fashion. Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a unilateral moderate/severe cortical contusion. Subjects received a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of PYC (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle, with treatment initiated at 15 min, 2 h, or 4 h post injury. All rats were killed at 96 h post TBI. Both the cortex and hippocampus ipsilateral and contralateral to the injury were evaluated for possible changes in oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive species; TBARS) and both pre- and post-synaptic proteins (synapsin-I, synaptophysin, drebrin, post synaptic density protein-95, and synapse associated protein-97). Following TBI, TBARS were significantly increased in both the injured cortex and ipsilateral hippocampus. Regardless of the dose and delay in treatment, PYC treatment significantly lowered TBARS. PYC treatment significantly protected both the cortex and hippocampus from injury-related declines in pre- and post-synaptic proteins. These results demonstrate that a single i.v. treatment of PYC is neuroprotective after TBI with a therapeutic window of at least 4 h post trauma. The natural bioflavonoid PYC may provide a possible therapeutic intervention in neurotrauma.",

We tested extracts of blueberry, pomegranate, green and black tea, cinnamon, sesame, and French maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol and taxifolin), as well as curcumin, morin, and quercetin for their effects on the life span of mice. While many of these phytonutrients reportedly extend the life span of model organisms, we found no significant effect on the life span of male F1 hybrid mice, even though the dosages used reportedly produce defined therapeutic end points in mice. The compounds were fed beginning at 12 months of age. The control and treatment groups were iso-caloric with respect to one another. A 40% calorically restricted and other groups not reported here did experience life span extension. Body weights were un-changed relative to controls for all but two supplemented groups, indicating most supplements did not change energy absorption or utilization. Tea extracts with morin decreased weight, whereas quercetin, taxifolin, and Pycnogenol together increased weight. These changes may be due to altered locomotion or fatty acid biosynthesis. Published reports of murine life span extension using curcumin or tea components may have resulted from induced caloric restriction. Together, our results do not support the idea that isolated phytonutrient anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories are potential longevity therapeutics, even though consumption of whole fruits and vegetables is associated with enhanced health span and life span.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation play a crucial role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment. Current PD drugs provide only symptomatic relief and have limitations in terms of adverse effects and inability to prevent neurodegeneration. Flavonoids have been suggested to exert human health benefits by its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, in the present study, using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro pyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of Parkinsonism, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of bioflavonoid compound Pycnogenol® (PYC), an extract of Pinus maritime bark. MPTP injected mice developed significantly severe oxidative stress and impaired motor coordination at day 1 and day 7 postinjection. This was associated with significantly increased inflammatory responses of astrocyte and microglia as assessed by ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba 1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry, and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the striata by Western blot. Additionally, there was significant upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) expression in the striata of MPTP injected mice compared to saline controls. The MPTP-induced neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and behavioral impairments were markedly repudiated by treatment with PYC. These results suggest that PYC protects dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced toxicity in the mouse model of PD. Thus, the present finding of PYC-induced adaptation to oxidative stress and inflammation could suggest a novel avenue for clinical intervention in neurodegenerative diseases including PD.",

Glycerine (control), E, and P were topically applied in group I, II, and III, respectively, and the prognosis of OM was assessed by functional, objective, and subjective parameters. RESULTS: Patients of group II and III showed significant improvement when ChROM was analyzed through scoring systems - WHO grading, Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS), and Children's International Mucositis Evaluation Scale (ChIMES) as compared to group I (P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference between groups II and III.

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves primary and secondary injury cascades that underlie delayed neuronal dysfunction and death. Oxidative stress is one of the most celebrated secondary injury mechanisms. A close relationship exists between levels of oxidative stress and the pathogenesis of TBI. However, other cascades, such as an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, also play important roles in the overall response to the trauma. Pharmacologic intervention, in order to be successful, requires a multifaceted approach. Naturally occurring flavonoids are unique in possessing not only tremendous free radical scavenging properties but also the ability to modulate cellular homeostasis leading to a reduction in inflammation and cell toxicity. This study evaluated the therapeutic role of Pycnogenol (PYC), a patented combinational bioflavonoid. Young adult Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a unilateral moderate cortical contusion and treated post injury with PYC or vehicle. At either 48 or 96 h post trauma, the animals were killed and the cortex and hippocampus analyzed for changes in enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidative stress markers. In addition, possible changes in both pre- and post-synaptic proteins (synapsin-1, PSD-95, drebrin, synapse associated protein-97) were analyzed. Finally, a separate cohort of animals was used to evaluate two proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α). Following the trauma there was a significant increase in oxidative stress in both the injured cortex and the ipsilateral hippocampus. Animals treated with PYC significantly ameliorated levels of protein carbonyls, lipid peroxidation, and protein nitration. The PYC treatment also significantly reduced the loss of key pre- and post-synaptic proteins with some levels in the hippocampus of PYC treated animals not significantly different from sham operated controls. Although levels of the proinflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated in both injury groups, the cohort treated with PYC showed a significant reduction compared to vehicle treated controls. These results are the first to show a neuroprotective effect of PYC following TBI. They also suggest that the diverse effects of bioflavonoids may provide a unique avenue for possible therapeutic intervention following head trauma.",

However, the protective mechanism by which PYC provides protection in a model type I diabetes has not been studied. This study examines the beneficial effect of PYC on hyperglycemia, inflammatory markers, and oxidative damage in diabetic rats. We also evaluated the possible mechanism of action of PYC which might be that it stimulates beta islet expression, which has been implicated in the process of insulin secretion and diabetes management. Diabetes was induced in rats by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 60 mg/kg body weight) followed by free access to 5 % glucose for the next 24 h. Four days after STZ injection, rats were supplemented with PYC (10 mg/kg body weight) for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, blood was drawn, and rats were then sacrificed, and their livers and pancreases were dissected for biochemical and histological assays. The level of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin significantly increased but amylase, insulin, and hepatic glycogen level decreased in the STZ group. PYC significantly augmented these effects in STZ + PYC group. The STZ group showed elevated level of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1beta in serum which were decreased by PYC treatment. Moreover, PYC significantly ameliorated increased thiobarbituric reactive substances, protein carbonyl, and decreased levels of glutathione, glutathione-s-transferase, and catalase activity in the liver and pancreas of the STZ rats. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination also revealed a remarkable protective effect of PYC. The study suggests that PYC is effective in reducing diabetic-related complications in a type I model of diabetes and might be beneficial for the treatment of diabetic patients.",

Pycnogenol(®), a herbal dietary supplement derived from French maritime pine bark extract, is standardised to contain 70% procyanidin which is a powerful antioxidant. Pycnogenol(®) is marketed as a supplement for preventing or treating a wide range of chronic conditions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of Pycnogenol(®) for the treatment of chronic disorders. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (until 18 September 2010), MEDLINE (until 18 September 2010) and EMBASE (until 13 October 2010) as well as three trial registries. We also contacted the manufacturer of Pycnogenol(®) and hand-searched bibliographies of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of Pycnogenol(®) in adults or children with any chronic disorder were included. We assessed clinical outcomes directly related to the disorder (stratified as participant- and investigator-reported) and all-cause mortality as primary outcomes. We also assessed adverse events and biomarkers of oxidative stress. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted all data and assessed risk of bias. A third author additionally extracted information on outcomes and results. With three exceptions, results for outcomes across studies could not be pooled. MAIN RESULTS: This review includes 15 trials with a total of 791 participants that have evaluated Pycnogenol(®) for the treatment of seven different chronic disorders. These included asthma (two studies; N = 86), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (one study; N = 61), chronic venous insufficiency (two studies; N = 60), diabetes mellitus (four studies; N = 201), erectile dysfunction (one study; N = 21), hypertension (two studies; N = 69) and osteoarthritis (three studies; N = 293). Two of the studies were conducted exclusively in children; the others involved adults.Due to small sample size, limited numbers of trials per condition, variation in outcomes evaluated and outcome measures used, as well as the risk of bias in the included studies, no definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of Pycnogenol(®) are possible. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to support Pycnogenol(®) use for the treatment of any chronic disorder. Well-designed, adequately powered trials are needed to establish the value of this treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the major challenges associated with our ageing population is the increasing incidence of age-associated cognitive decline, which has significant implications for an individual's ability to lead a productive and fulfilling life. In pure economic terms the costs of ageing reflects decreased productivity and engagement with the workforce. The maintenance of brain health underpinning intact cognition is a key factor to maintaining a positive, engaged, and productive lifestyle. In light of this, the role of diet, including supplementation with nutritional and even pharmacological interventions capable of ameliorating the neurocognitive changes that occur with age constitute vital areas of research. METHODS: In order to reduce cognitive ageing, the ARC longevity intervention (ARCLI) was developed to examine the effects of two promising natural pharmacologically active supplements on cognitive performance. ARCLI is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 3-arm clinical trial in which 465 participants will be randomized to receive an extract of Bacopa monnieri (CDRI08 300 mg/day), Pycnogenol (150 mg/day), or placebo daily for 12 months. Participants will be tested at baseline and then at 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomization on a wide battery of cognitive, neuropsychological and mood measures, cardiovascular (brachial and aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as arterial stiffness), biochemical (assays to measure inflammation, oxidative stress and safety) as well as genetic assessments (telomere length and several Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). The primary aim is to investigate the effects of these supplements on cognitive performance. The secondary aims are to explore the time-course of cognitive enhancement as well as potential cardiovascular and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cognitive enhancement over the 12 months of administration.ARCLI will represent one of the largest and most comprehensive experimental clinical trials in which supplements are administered to elderly participants. Results from ARCLI may help develop novel preventative health practices and nutritional/pharmacological targets in the elderly for cognitive and brain health.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been implicated in the development of a number of conditions including cancer, arthritic disorders and cardiovascular disease. Pycnogenol(®), a herbal dietary supplement derived from French maritime pine bark extract, is standardised to contain 70% procyanidin which is a powerful antioxidant. Pycnogenol(®) is marketed as a supplement for preventing or treating a wide range of chronic conditions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of Pycnogenol(®) for the treatment of chronic disorders. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (until 18 September 2010), MEDLINE (until 18 September 2010) and EMBASE (until 13 October 2010) as well as three trial registries. We also contacted the manufacturer of Pycnogenol(®) and hand-searched bibliographies of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of Pycnogenol(®) in adults or children with any chronic disorder were included. We assessed clinical outcomes directly related to the disorder (stratified as participant- and investigator-reported) and all-cause mortality as primary outcomes. We also assessed adverse events and biomarkers of oxidative stress. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted all data and assessed risk of bias. A third author additionally extracted information on outcomes and results. With three exceptions, results for outcomes across studies could not be pooled. MAIN RESULTS: This review includes 15 trials with a total of 791 participants that have evaluated Pycnogenol(®) for the treatment of seven different chronic disorders. These included asthma (two studies; N = 86), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (one study; N = 61), chronic venous insufficiency (two studies; N = 60), diabetes mellitus (four studies; N = 201), erectile dysfunction (one study; N = 21), hypertension (two studies; N = 69) and osteoarthritis (three studies; N = 293). Two of the studies were conducted exclusively in children; the others involved adults.Due to small sample size, limited numbers of trials per condition, variation in outcomes evaluated and outcome measures used, as well as the risk of bias in the included studies, no definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of Pycnogenol(®) are possible. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to support Pycnogenol(®) use for the treatment of any chronic disorder. Well-designed, adequately powered trials are needed to establish the value of this treatment.",

Pycnogenol (PYC) is the natural plant extract from the bark of Pinus pinaster Aiton. and has potent antioxidant activities. We studied the protective effect of PYC on excessive fat accumulation in the liver fed a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) high-fat diet for 6 weeks. Pycnogenol (10 mg/kg body weight) was orally administered for 5 weeks. At the end of the experiment, blood and liver samples were collected and assessed for effects of PYC by histopathological and biochemical analyses. Histopathological analyses of liver tissues stained with Azan-Mallory showed hepatic macrovesicular steatosis and fibrosis in MCD-fed rats. Supplementation of PYC prevented this effect. Pycnogenol treatment significantly decreased the liver triglyceride and serum alanine amino transferase levels. Our results indicated that orally administered PYC may serve to prevent NASH-induced liver damage.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Extracts from pine tree bark containing a variety of flavonoids have been used in traditional medicine. Pycnogenol is a proprietary bark extract of the French maritime pine tree (Pinus pinaster ssp. atlantica) that exerts antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-platelet effects. However, the effects of Pycnogenol on endothelial dysfunction, a precursor of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events, remain still elusive. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) completed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Patients received Pycnogenol (200 mg/day) for 8 weeks followed by placebo or vice versa on top of standard cardiovascular therapy. Between the two treatment periods, a 2-week washout period was scheduled. At baseline and after each treatment period, endothelial function, non-invasively assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery using high-resolution ultrasound, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, platelet adhesion, and 24 h blood pressure monitoring were evaluated. In CAD patients, Pycnogenol treatment was associated with an improvement of FMD from 5.3 ± 2.6 to 7.0 ± 3.1 (P < 0.0001), while no change was observed with placebo (5.4 ± 2.4 to 4.7 ± 2.0; P = 0.051). This difference between study groups was significant [estimated treatment effect 2.75; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.75, 3.75, P < 0.0001]. 15-F(2t)-Isoprostane, an index of oxidative stress, significantly decreased from 0.71 ± 0.09 to 0.66 ± 0.13 after Pycnogenol treatment, while no change was observed in the placebo group (mean difference 0.06 pg/mL with an associated 95% CI (0.01, 0.11), P = 0.012]. Inflammation markers, platelet adhesion, and blood pressure did not change after treatment with Pycnogenol or placebo. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence that the antioxidant Pycnogenol improves endothelial function in patients with CAD by reducing oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Acute gouty arthritis results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition in joint tissues. Deposited MSU crystals induce an acute inflammatory response which leads to damage of joint tissue. Pycnogenol (PYC), an extract from the bark of Pinus maritime, has documented antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. The present study aimed to investigate whether PYC had protective effects on MSU-induced inflammatory and nitrosative stress in joint tissues both in vitro and in vivo. MSU crystals upregulated cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression in human articular chondrocytes, but only COX-2 and IL-8 in synovial fibroblasts. PYC inhibited the up-regulation of COX-2, and IL-8 in both articular chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts. PYC attenuated MSU crystal induced iNOS gene expression and NO production in chondrocytes. Activation of NF-κB and SAPK/JNK, ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases by MSU crystals in articular chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts in vitro was attenuated by treatment with PYC. The acute inflammatory cell infiltration and increased expression of COX-2 and iNOS in synovial tissue and articular cartilage following intra-articular injection of MSU crystals in a rat model was inhibited by coadministration of PYC. Collectively, this study demonstrates that PYC may be of value in treatment of MSU crystal-induced arthritis through its anti-inflammatory and anti-nitrosative activities.",
