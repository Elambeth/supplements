      "abstract": "The management of infected chronic wounds is one of the urgent challenges. Herein, a hesperidin (Hes)-loaded self-assembled supramolecular hydrogel based on quaternized chitosan (CQHP) has been developed as an efficient photothermal antibacterial dressing for MRSA-infected wound healing. Specifically, CQHP hydrogels fabricated through the dynamic noncovalent interactions among CM-β-CD grafted QCS, Hes, proline and Fe3+, exhibited injectable and self-healing behaviors, along with adhesion, antioxidant, hemostatic and protein adsorption performance, satisfying the essential feature as chronic wound dressing. Of note, superior photothermal effect generated from the Hes-Fe3+ has been demonstrated, which endowed the CQHP hydrogels effectively and rapidly eliminate the E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA through photothermal therapy, thereby avoiding the use of antibiotics or photothermal conversion nanomaterials in hydrogels and substantially reducing the biological toxicity. Furtherly, sustained antibacterial performance in the absence of NIR can be achieved through the inherent antibacterial activities of Hes. Importantly, the developed CQHP hydrogels significantly promoted the closure of acute full-thickness scratch wounds, and exhibited remarkable better therapeutic effect on MRSA-infected wound than commercial 3M transparent film, by efficiency and sustained antibacterial activity, reducing inflammation, enhancing angiogenesis and collagen deposition, highlighting its promising application in the MRSA-infected wound healing with high efficiency, quality and security.",

      "abstract": "Background: Various routes of drug administration are available for psoriasis treatment. However, there is an urgent need for novel and improved therapeutic options. Hence, our study aimed to develop a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) gel of hesperidin (HPD) using a systemic QbD approach for an effective treatment of psoriasis. Methods: Initially, HPD-NLC was optimized with independent variables (drug content, amount of liquid lipid, total lipid, and surfactant concentration) using Box-Behnken Design to assess dependent variables (particle size, size distribution, and entrapment efficiency). HPD-NLC was developed using the high-shear homogenization technique. The characteristics of nanoformulation such as particle size, morphology [transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)], crystallinity [powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)], and chemical interactions [Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)], the drug entrapment efficiency (%EE), and the drug release were investigated. Franz-diffusion cell was utilized to perform in vitro diffusion study, and an imiquimod-induced psoriasis model was used for in vivo study. Results: The optimized HPD-NLC exhibited a spherical shape with particle size of 125.7 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.36, and entrapment efficiency of 52.26% w/w. Further, different techniques validated the reduced crystallinity of the hesperidin. The in vitro diffusion study highlighted the sustained and anomalous diffusion of the drug from NLC gel. In the in vivo study, the HPD-NLC-Gel-treated group displayed normal skin with minimal keratosis, while the drug-loaded gel group exhibited signs of hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis signs. Conclusions: HPD-NLC gel showed promising advancement in nanotechnology-based psoriasis treatment and the results of this study open the door for the application of topical HPD-NLC-Gel clinically."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The most used antipyretic and pain relief treatment is paracetamol (acetaminophen), also known as N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP). However, it is considered potentially hazardous if consumed repeatedly in large doses or over prolonged periods. This investigation explores the effectiveness of hesperidin (Hesp) and Hesp loaded on layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (Hesp-NPs) in inhibiting the progression of acute hepatotoxicity in rats induced by APAP. Methods: LDH-Hesp-NPs were prepared and characterized. Male Wistar rats were orally treated with Hesp and Hesp-NPs at the same adjusted dose (100 mg/kg) every other day for six weeks. After 2 h of the first doses of Hesp and Hesp-NPs, the rats received one oral dose of APAP (750 mg/kg). Results: Administering of Hesp and Hesp-NPs to APAP-treated rats significantly reduced oxidant parameter (malondialdehyde) and serum enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH, and ALP) associated with liver function. Antioxidant markers in the liver, such as catalase and glutathione, also increased notably. Moreover, Hesp and Hesp-NPs enhanced the mRNA expression of liver UGT1A6, IL-10, and HO-1. Conversely, the mRNA expressions of liver CYP1A1, KEAP1, TGF-β, P53, and BAX decreased. These improvements in biochemical and molecular markers were corroborated by liver histopathology. Conclusions: Hesp and Hesp-NPs protect significantly against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in male Wistar rats. Hesp-NPs treatment was more potent. The protective effects may be mediated via modulation of APAP biotransformation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis."

      "abstract": "Background Regenerative endodontics is revolutionizing pulp preservation by utilizing bioactive materials to enhance dentinogenesis. Direct pulp capping, a widely used technique, often relies on traditional pulp-capping agents (PCAs) like Biodentine. However, limitations such as reduced long-term bioactivity highlight the need for novel alternatives. Hesperidin, a natural flavonoid with potent anti-inflammatory and angiogenic properties, has emerged as a promising candidate. This study investigates and compares the growth factor release profiles of hesperidin hydrogel and Biodentine to assess their potential in vital pulp therapy. Methods Sixty extracted human third molars were processed into dentin discs and divided into two groups: hesperidin hydrogel and Biodentine. Each group was further subdivided based on incubation durations (7, 14, and 28 days). The release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vitro permeation studies and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed to assess material properties. Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). Results Hesperidin hydrogel demonstrated a significantly higher and sustained release of VEGF compared to Biodentine across all time intervals (p < 0.0001). While Biodentine showed an initial burst release that declined over time, hesperidin hydrogel maintained stable bioactivity, indicating prolonged regenerative potential. Conclusion Hesperidin hydrogel outperforms Biodentine in sustaining VEGF release, making it a promising next-generation biomaterial for direct pulp capping. Its ability to promote angiogenesis and support long-term pulp vitality highlights its potential to revolutionize regenerative endodontics. Further in vivo studies are needed to confirm its clinical efficacy."

      "abstract": "Hesperidin, a citrus flavanone, demonstrates significant potential as an anticancer agent by targeting the c-Myc G-quadruplex (G4) silencer element (Pu-27), a key epigenetic regulator of c-Myc expression. Molecular docking analysis revealed a strong interaction with Pu-27 (binding energy: -48.344 kcal/mol), forming hydrogen bonds across five critical regions. This interaction stabilized the G4 structure, as confirmed by increased ellipticity, higher melting temperature, and enhanced nanostructure formation. In functional assays, Hesperidin selectively inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells while sparing normal cells. It significantly reduced clonogenic potential, migration, and c-Myc expression, indicating its role in suppressing oncogenic pathways. Moreover, Hesperidin effectively reduced primer dimer formation in the PCR stop assay and decreased mTFP expression in the mTFP reporter assay, further supporting its specificity for G4 stabilization. Preclinical studies demonstrated that Hesperidin treatment led to a marked reduction in tumor volume with minimal systemic toxicity, highlighting its therapeutic potential. These findings establish Hesperidin as a promising small-molecule stabilizer of the c-Myc G4 silencer, offering a targeted strategy for breast cancer therapy. By directly modulating c-Myc expression, hesperidin holds promise for clinical translation as a selective and effective anticancer agent."

      "abstract": "In recent years, therapeutic approaches against diabetes-induced liver damage have attracted great interest. Studies indicate the anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and lipid-lowering potential of hesperidin (HESP), a flavonoid in citrus fruits. This study examined how HESP prevented streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic liver damage. Four groups of seven rats each were created: Control, HESP (100 mg/kg/day), STZ (45 mg/kg), and STZ + HESP (45 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively). Serum AST, ALT, LDH, LDL, triglyceride, total cholesterol levels, and the TNF-α, IL-1β, and caspase-3 expression levels of liver tissue in the STZ group were higher than the other groups (p < 0.05). However, these values were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the STZ + HESP group compared to the STZ group. Furthermore, administering HESP together with STZ reduced liver expression levels of caspase-3, TNF-α, and IL-1β, as well as blood levels of AST, ALT, LDH, LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol. HESP against diabetes-induced hepatic damage reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels, and returned the lipid profile, and apoptotic indicators to normal levels. These findings suggested that HESP therapy may be an important therapeutic role against diabetes-induced liver damage."

      "abstract": "Excess iron has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. Flavonoids are antioxidants and cardioprotectants. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to evaluate the anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and iron-chelating qualities of two flavonoids, rutin (R) and hesperidin (H), as well as their potential to prevent induced ferroptosis in rats. It is an in vivo cross-sectional study, in which rats were divided into 12 groups; control, H, R, H + R, Fe, Fe + IR, Fe + IR + Ref, Fe + H, Fe + IR + H, Fe + R, Fe + IR + R and Fe + IR + H + R. Cardiac and serum iron levels, serum troponin I, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin, ferritin, and hepicidin were determined. Moreover, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), were also determined. The expression levels of DMT1, ACSL4, GPX4, Nrf2, and caspase-3 genes were evaluated by RT-qPCR. Lastly, a histological analysis of the heart tissues from several groups of rats was conducted. After hesperidin and/or rutin treatment, our results revealed that cardiac markers (serum troponin I and CK-MB), iron metabolism markers (serum and cardiac iron, TIBC, ferritin, transferrin, hepicidin and DMT1 expression levels) and oxidative stress markers (MDA, NO and ACSL4 expression levels) were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) reduced, while the antioxidant markers (GSH level, GPx and SOD activities and GPX4 and Nrf2 expression levels) were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) increased. Also, hesperidin and rutin exerted its protective anti-apoptotic role by significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) decreasing caspase-3 expression levels. Hesperidin and/or rutin treatment can be proposed as a therapeutic candidate to attenuate ferroptosis.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: The ALB-HSD NLC was fabricated using Melt emulsification followed by the sonication method and optimized using a central composite design. The optimized formulation was evaluated for various in vitro and in vivo studies. RESULTS: The optimized ALB-HSD NLC had satisfactory results for particle size, Zeta Potential, PDI, and entrapment efficiency. The drug release was more than 2.5-fold higher compared to drugs suspension over 72 hr. A549 human lung cell line study shows IC50 for ALB and HSD, were 2.289 µg/mL and 73.52 µg/mL, and the dose-dependent toxicity was 0.0209 μg/mL and 0.5213 μg/mL for ALB-HSD NLC formulation and ALB HSD Suspension, respectively, after 72 hr. The Pharmacokinetic study has demonstrated improved AUC0-t (1.38, 1.57-fold) of ALB and HSD from NLC compared to drug suspension. In vivo studies give significant results on the syngeneic model. CONCLUSIONS: The prepared ALB-HSD NLC could be promising drug carriers, and they succeeded in delivering small and efficient doses of ALB and HSD to treat NSCLC."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Hesperidin (HSP) is a potent phytochemical antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that protects against otitis media. However, due to its low solubility and bioavailability, a suitable delivery method is needed to overcome these problems. A hydrogel is a promising nanocarrier for controlled drug delivery in response to external stimuli, such as pH variations. Methods: Graphene oxide (GO)-based nanocarriers that encapsulate hesperidin (HSP) were further coated with a polylactic-co-glycolic acid/alginate (PLGA-Alg) hydrogel before being integrated into a green neem oil (N.O.) double emulsion to produce a synergistic effect and then characterized by different assays. Results: The nanocarriers exhibited a substantial particle size (168 ± 0.32 nm), with high encapsulation (89.86 ± 0.23%) and a zeta potential of 37 ± 0.43 mV. In vitro release studies conducted over 96 h indicated a sustained HSP release of 82% at pH 5.4 and 65% at pH 7.4. The GO-HSP-loaded neem oil double emulsion formulation exhibits substantial antibacterial activity, as evidenced by inhibition zones of 39 ± 0.02 mm against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and considerable antifungal activity against Candida albicans, with an inhibition zone of 43 ± 0.13 mm, along with biofilm inhibition activity. The formulation demonstrated antioxidant activity (5.21 µg/mL) and increased cell viability (90-95%) while maintaining low cytotoxicity in HSE-2 cells. A histopathological analysis confirmed that treatment with the nanocarriers reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, TLR4, IL-6) and raised the levels of antioxidant markers (Nrf-2, SOD) in an in vivo rat model of otitis media. Conclusions: GO-based nanocarriers integrated into a neem oil double emulsion and coated with PLGA-Alg hydrogel deliver hesperidin with sustained release and enhanced antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties. This formulation may be used to treat otitis media and other oxidative stress diseases."

      "abstract": "Malathion, a widely used organophosphate, is known for its relatively low toxicity and extensive application. However, it has been found to act as a female reproductive toxicant by causing oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and hormonal imbalances. Hesperidin, a flavonoid belonging to the flavanone class, exhibits various beneficial properties such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which can potentially counteract harmful effects. The objective of this study was to examine how hesperidin and malathion impact the expression of miRNAs and genes linked to apoptosis and inflammation. Balb/c mice (n = 40) were divided into four groups: hesperidin (20 mg/kg), malathion (3 mg/kg), hesperidin+malathion, and control. After a 35-day intraperitoneal treatment, the mice were sacrificed. The left ovaries were used for analyzing the expression of miRNA-146a-5p, miRNA-129-3p, miRNA-96-5p, NF-κB, Bax, and Bcl-2 through RT-qPCR, as well as the levels of several cytokines using the ELISA method. The right ovaries were examined through histological and immunohistochemical techniques using H&E and NF-κB staining. Malathion exposure led to an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, upregulated expression of Bax and NF-κB, elevated levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-6, enhanced expression of miRNA-146a-5p, decreased expression of miRNA-129-3p and miRNA-96-5p, and reduced levels of IL-4 and IL-10. Additionally, malathion-exposed ovaries exhibited structural abnormalities and disrupted architecture, accompanied by heightened NF-κB immunoreactivity. Conversely, treatment with hesperidin showed its capacity to counteract the detrimental consequences of malathion on the ovaries by alleviating or reversing these changes. In conclusion, hesperidin showed protective effects against malathion-induced ovarian toxicity by modulating cytokine production, apoptosis, inflammation, and miRNA expression."

      "abstract": "The flavonoid hesperidin is a crucial, biologically active substance of great interest because of its polypharmacological properties and high safety profile. However, its widespread use of this bioflavonoid in remedies for the treatment and prevention of various diseases is limited by its low water solubility. This study reports on solid dispersed systems (SDSs) of hesperidin, fabricated for the first time via the method of centrifugal fibre. For one of the compositions of these SDSs, the solubility of the flavonoid in water is observed to be 150-170 times higher than that of the pure compound. Polyvinylpyrrolidones, with different molecular weights, was used as a fibre-forming polymer carrier, alongside sucrose and mannitol as auxiliary substances to enhance the yield of the composites. The SDSs of hesperidin in the form of fibres were characterised via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). DSC and PXRD results confirmed the amorphisation of hesperidin in the fibrous SDSs. FTIR results confirmed that the interaction of hesperidin with the components of the SDS composites occurs due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Studies of in vitro release kinetics in buffer media with pH = 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 showed that the release rate of hesperidin from the centrifugally formed SDSs is considerably higher than the dissolution rate of pure hesperidin. Thus, the results of this study confirm that centrifugal fibre formation is a simple and effective method for fabricating highly soluble SDSs of hesperidin."

      "abstract": "Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a chemotherapy agent commonly used for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, with diarrhea being a frequent adverse effect. Hesperidin is a flavonoid abundant in citrus fruits and has shown potential in managing CPT-11-induced diarrhea (CID). However, the mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. This study established a mouse model of CID using CPT-11 administration to evaluate the effects of hesperidin on diarrhea severity, intestinal pathology, gut microbiota composition, and metabolite profiles by conducting biochemical analysis, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, 16S rRNA sequencing, and untargeted metabolomics. In addition, transcriptomic analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate potential mechanisms of action. Hesperidin supplementation was found to significantly alleviate CID in mice. Analysis of gut microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that hesperidin improved microbial composition, with key taxa such as Alistipes, Limosilactobacillus, Rikenella, and Mucispirillum playing a central role in ameliorating CID. Furthermore, hesperidin enhanced intestinal barrier function by upregulating tight junction proteins, mitigating epithelial damage, and reducing the expression of IL-17A, TARF6, p38, phosphorylated-p38 (P-p38), and AP-1 proteins in the colon. These findings suggest that hesperidin supplementation mitigates CID by modulating gut microbiota and inhibiting the IL-17 signaling pathway, thereby improving intestinal barrier integrity.",

      "abstract": "Background: This study investigated the combined effects of hesperidin (Hesp), a natural flavonoid, with bleomycin (BL), a commonly used chemotherapy agent, on A549 human lung cancer cells. Methods: Key parameters assessed included cell viability, colony formation, and cell migration, alongside the expression of apoptotic and autophagic markers (p53, p21, Bax, cleaved PARP, and Beclin-1), VEGF levels, and caspase-3 activity. Results: The findings revealed that the Hesp + BL combination significantly amplified antiproliferative, apoptotic, anti-angiogenic, and autophagic effects compared to either treatment alone. The combination therapy effectively inhibited colony formation and cell migration while markedly reducing VEGF levels, indicating strong anti-angiogenic properties. Apoptotic markers such as p53, p21, Bax, and cPARP were significantly upregulated, with caspase-3 activity confirming robust apoptosis induction. Furthermore, autophagy was notably enhanced, as reflected by increased Beclin-1 expression. Conclusions: Synergistic interactions between Hesp and BL, validated through combination index analysis, underscore the therapeutic potential of this combination. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of the Hesp + BL combination as a promising strategy for lung cancer treatment, meriting further exploration in diverse lung cancer cell lines to validate and expand its applicability in developing novel therapeutic approaches."

      "abstract": "Obesity, a persistent imbalance of calories, has become one of the major clinical factors that result in many metabolic disorders. Despite excellent anti-obesity properties, the poor aqueous solubility of hesperidin (HES), a flavonoid, hampers its applicability. To resolve this issue and conquer oral administration's drawbacks, our study has concentrated on encapsulating HES in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and incorporating the NLCs into microneedles (MNs). By developing HES-loaded NLCs (HES-NLCs) with hyaluronic acid (HA) as a base design to form a microneedle patch (HES-NLCMNP), the study aimed to increase the stability and bioavailability of HES and provide an innovative way for the management of obesity. HES-NLCs were loaded to the microneedle, to promote anti-obesity activity. The microneedle tip, which has been composed of HA, will act as a biodegradable polymer that could effectively deliver the activity of HES-NLC to the blood stream. Furthermore, the base of the microneedle patch composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) offered excellent flexibility, releasing HES and providing resistance to any adverse effects. Analysis revealed that the prepared HES-NLCs have desirable physical characteristics with an extended-release profile. The optimised NLC formulation (F3F) was later incorporated into HA-base-designed MNs that demonstrated mechanical solid integrity and effective skin penetration. In vivo pharmacokinetics significantly improved all parameters with a reduced elimination rate. Physiological, haematological, and antioxidant markers improved in treated rats, with histopathological analysis showing significant tissue alterations. The results suggest that HES-NLCMNP is a promising platform to improve drug effectiveness, patient compliance, and treatment outcomes for obesity.",

Currently, treatment options for MsPGN are limited, and there is a need for effective therapeutic interventions. Hesperidin (HSP), a natural flavonoid glycoside, has shown promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in various disease models. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of HSP for MsPGN and explore its possible mechanism of action. A male Wistar rat model of MsPGN was established via tail vein injection of Thy-1 monoclonal antibody, and the rats were divided into four groups: Control, MsPGN, MsPGN + HSP, and MsPGN + Prednisone. After 7 days of intervention, the therapeutic effects of HSP were evaluated through biochemical and histological analyses. Our results demonstrated that HSP treatment significantly reduced the levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, and improved renal pathology. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, were markedly decreased. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed reduced levels of immunoglobulin G and C5b-9, along with decreased immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Furthermore, HSP downregulated the phosphorylation levels of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), suggesting modulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. In conclusion, HSP might effectively alleviate renal injury, reduce renal inflammatory response, and inhibit renal immune complex deposition, potentially through the suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway.",

These bacteria trigger an inflammatory host response leading to tissue destruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to either a test group receiving 500 mg of hesperidin daily or a control group receiving a placebo both alongside scaling and root planing (SRP). Clinical parameters including the gingival index (GI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were evaluated at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured at baseline and 3 weeks to assess systemic inflammation. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, 80 completed the study, with 60 males and 20 females. The test group showed significant reduction in serum CRP levels from baseline to 3 weeks (mean difference: 1.6300, P < 0.001), while the control group also showed a significant decrease (mean difference: -1.2730, P = 0.001). However, no statistically significant differences were found in clinical parameters (GI, SBI, PD, CAL) between the test and control groups at any time point. Intragroup analysis showed significant improvements in these parameters over time within both groups, indicating the effectiveness of SRP in managing clinical symptoms of periodontitis. CONCLUSION: Hesperidin significantly reduced serum CRP levels, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect, but did not result in significant improvements in clinical parameters compared to placebo."

      "abstract": "The incidence rate and mortality rate of breast cancer remain high, and there is an urgent need for safe and effective drugs. The excellent biological activity of hesperidin (HE) is a potential drug for the treatment of breast cancer. In this study, silk fibroin peptides (SFP) were used as delivery carriers and HE loaded SFP nanofibers (SFP/HE NFs) was prepared. The in vitro results showed that SFP/HE NFs significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 compared with free HE. The mechanism results demonstrated that SFP/HE NFs induced apoptosis and DNA double stranded damage (DSBs) and further activated the cyclic monophosphate guanosine adenosine monophosphate synthase- stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS-STING) pathway. The in vivo studies showed that SFP/HE NFs treatment significantly inhibited the growth of breast cancer, with an inhibition rate of 65.9 % (100 mg/kg). In vivo mechanism studies also demonstrated that the anti-tumor activity of SFP/HE NFs was related to the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Interestingly, we found that the combination of SFP/HE NFs and cisplatin not only enhanced the anti-tumor activity of cisplatin, but also alleviated cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the benefits of activating the cGAS-STING pathway in the treatment of breast cancer, which is expected to provide potential candidates for combined treatment of breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Hesperidin exhibits promising potential as a feed additive for augmenting gastric acid secretion in animals. Gastrointestinal function is essential for animal growth and the efficient digestion of dietary nutrients, with gastric acid secretion serving as one of its critical components. The secretion of gastric acid, together with other digestive fluids and substances, significantly influences the digestion and absorption of animal feed, which in turn affects growth performance. However, there is limited research regarding the application of hesperidin as a feed additive to enhance gastric acid secretion. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hesperidin as a feed additive in enhancing gastric acid secretion and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. A total of 200 newly hatched (1-day-old) broilers with similar body weight were randomly allocated into four groups as follows: the control group receiving only the basal diet, and the other three groups supplemented with 50, 100, and 150 mg of hesperidin per kg of the basal diet, respectively. Each group consisted of five replicates with ten broilers per replicate, and the feeding trial lasted for a duration of 21 days. The growth performance was evaluated by monitoring feed intake and body weight throughout the trial. A four-day nutrient utilization trial was conducted prior to the conclusion of the feeding experiment. Adoption of the total collection method, the collected droppings were weighed and dried at 65 °C. Fifteen broilers from each group were euthanized and immediately dissected to obtain gizzard, proventriculus, gizzard chyme, and jugular blood samples, The proventriculus and gizzard weight were weighed and the pH of gizzard chyme was measured at the same time. The collected jugular venous blood was used to assess gastrin levels, whereas chicken gizzard chyme was utilized for the analysis of lactate, hydrochloric acid, and pepsin activity. Proventriculus and gizzard tissues were used to evaluate pepsinogen levels, perform hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, conduct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for key proton pump components, and assess proton pump activity. The results demonstrated that, in comparison to the control group, both the 100mg/Kg and 150 mg/Kg groups exhibited a significant increase in final body weight (FBW) and average daily gain (ADG) (P < 0.05). Additionally, the feed to gain ratio (F/G) was significantly reduced in the 150mg/Kg group (P < 0.05). The results of the nutrient utilization trial indicate that all treatment groups had significantly higher levels of dry matter (DM) and ether extract (EE) compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, crude protein (CP) and gross energy (ME) were significantly higher in the 100mg/Kg and 150mg/Kg groups than in both the control group and the 50mg/Kg group (P < 0.05). The inclusion of hesperidin in broiler diets leads to significant improvements in stomach development and lactic acid content, while pH and hydrochloric acid content exhibit opposite trends (P < 0.05). Supplementation of broiler diets with hesperidin at doses of 100 mg/Kg and 150 mg/Kg significantly up-regulates pepsin activity and pepsinogen levels (P < 0.05). Incorporation of hesperidin into the broilers' diet significantly enhances parietal cell numbers (P < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of hesperidin in broilers effectively up-regulates key signaling pathways and intracellular signal substances involved in proton pump activation (P < 0.05). The proton pump activity also exhibited a significant increase compared to the control group of 100mg/Kg and 150mg/Kg (P < 0.05) in our findings. In conclusion, hesperidin exhibits promising potential as a feed additive for broilers, and it can improve the growth performance of broilers by increasing gastric acid secretion and promoting nutrient utilization through activation of proton pump. Notably, basal diet supplemented with 150mg/Kg hesperidin demonstrates superior efficacy.",

However, it provokes cytotoxicity. 2S-hesperidin (2S-HES) is a potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-lipidemic flavanone. Regardless, the 2S-HES impact on DDVP-occupied hepatic injury remains fuzzy. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of 2S-HES in a rat model of DDVP-elicited hepatic intoxication. Forty-two rats were randomly allotted to seven groups (n = 6/condition): control, DDVP (8 mg kg⁻1day⁻1), DDVP with 2S-HES (50 and 100 mg kg⁻1day⁻1), DDVP with atropine, and 2S-HES alone (50 and 100 mg kg⁻1day⁻1). DDVP was administered orally for 7 days, followed by 14 days of 2S-HES chemotherapy. 2S-HES intervention partially mitigated DDVP-triggered alterations in leakage enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, LDH-5), total protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, electrolytes, ion-transporters, lipid profiles, and HMG-CoA reductase. Furthermore, 2S-HES partially reversed DDVP-provoked increases in hepatic H₂O₂, NO, and malondialdehyde; transposed DDVP-mediated decreased liver GSH amount and activities of GST, SOD, catalase, and GPx; attenuated DDVP-triggered upregulated NF-κB-p65 and caspase-3; and abated DDVP-engendered repressed interleukin-10 mRNA expression. Cytoarchitectural analyses authenticated the 2-HES reduction in DDVP-evoked hepatocellular vacuolation. Altogether, 2S-HES elicited promising alternative or adjunctive therapy for partially mitigating DDVP-incited hepatic injury by attenuating leakage enzymes, ionoregulatory disruptions, ion pump inhibition, dyslipidemias, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cisplatin (Cisp) is a chemotherapy drug for treating liver cancer. Hesperidin (HSD), a flavanone, is known for its anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Diosmin (DSM), a flavone glycoside, is known for its anti-oxidant effect. This research investigated the synergism cytotoxic effect and senescence selectivity effect of HSD or DSM co-treatment with Cisp on HepG2 cells and Vero cells. METHODS: The cytotoxicity and cell viability of HSD or DSM combined with Cisp on HepG2 and Vero cells were assessed using the MTT assay with IC50 parameters, selectivity index (SI), and Combination Index (CI), while the antiproliferative profile was determined by colony-forming assay. Cellular senescence on HepG2 and Vero cell lines was determined using senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining. Furthermore, the impact of apoptosis was evaluated using flowcitometry. RESULT: In the MTT assay, HSD, DSM, and cisplatin exhibited cytotoxic effects on HepG2 cells, with IC50 values of 321 µM, 148 µM, and 5 µM, respectively. Co-treatment with HSD and DSM with cisplatin enhanced cell sensitivity, resulting in a combination index of < 1. HSD and DSM exhibited minimal cytotoxicity against Vero cells, with IC50 values exceeding 500 µM. Both HSD and DSM reduced cellular senescence in Vero cells caused by cisplatin exposure. These findings suggest that co-treatment with HSD and DSM alongside cisplatin can synergistically lessen the viability of HepG2 cells. The Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis assay also showed more cells undergoing apoptosis in the co-treatment group. Both co-treatment HSD and DSM with Cisp independently induced the senescence of HepG2 cells and reduced the cellular senescence of normal kidney cells. CONCLUSION: Consequently, both HSD and DSM show potential for development as co-treatment agents in combination with Cisp for hepatocellular carcinoma, and they may also be useful for reducing senescence in normal kidney cells.",

Hesperidin (Hesp), is a pharmacologically active flavonoid, found abundantly in citrus species. Our present research attempts to inspect the potential hepatoprotective role of Hesp against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatic fibrosis. Thirty-two male albino rats were split up into four equal groups, each with eight rats: Cont group was treated with ip saline. Every other day, the TAA group was injected 100 mg/kg BW ip TAA, Hesp group received every day oral Hesp 200 mg/kg BW as well as TAA + Hesp group received both therapies (TAA, Hesp) for eight successive weeks. Hesp in TAA treated group reduces ALT, AST, and ALP activities, total, direct bilirubin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, meanwhile TP, Alb, globulin, A/G ratio levels were insignificantly differed. The antioxidant capacity of Hesp was pronounced by a marked reduction in MDA level. While the antioxidant markers (SOD, CAT, GSH) were insignificantly changed after Hesp treatment. A strong significant correlation in treated rats between fibrosis score and CD34 and FGF23 gene expression. Liver sections from dual-treated rats showed a moderately decreased hepatic lesion and the dense, bluish-stained fibrous tissue by Masson's trichrome. Elevated gene expressions of CD34 and FGF23 after TAA hepatotoxicity were diminished by the antifibrotic effect of Hesp. Also, immunohistochemical expression showed reduction of TGF-β and α-SMA in hepatocytes in the dual therapy group. Hesp possesses a potent antioxidant, and antifibrotic activities against TAA induced hepatic fibrosis by modulating TGF-β/α-SMA pathways.",

      "abstract": "The main aim of this study is to address the global health crisis posed by tuberculosis (TB) through the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies targeting Mycobacterial phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (MtPrsA), an untried enzyme involved in essential metabolic pathways of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This enzyme plays a crucial role in cell wall synthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis and amino acid synthesis in M tb. Any hindrance to these may affect the growth and survival of the organism. Phytochemicals were systematically screened for potential inhibitors to MtPrsA. Subsequently, based on molecular docking studies, three compounds, namely, hesperidin, rebaudiosideA and rutin were selected. The binding stabilities of these compounds were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the RMSD score obtained, the binding stability of the compounds was confirmed. To validate the findings, an enzyme inhibition assay was done using recombinant MtPrsA. Ligation Independent Cloning (LIC cloning) method was used to produce recombinant His-tagged MtPrsA, followed by purification using Histrap columns. Enzyme kinetic studies unveiled the distinct modes of inhibition exhibited by each compound towards MtPrsA. RebaudiosideA and rutin emerged as competitive inhibitors, while hesperidin showcased a mixed inhibition profile. In conclusion, the study contributes valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for TB, through the exploration of alternative enzyme targets and the identification of phytochemical inhibitors. Notably, todate, no effective plant compounds have been reported as inhibitors to MtPrsA."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSCs and their combination with micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) in a croton oil-induced hemorrhoids model on tissue edema, inflammation, and underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MSCs were isolated and characterized for their adherence, differentiation capacity, and immunophenotyping. Croton oil-induced hemorrhoid mouse models were established to assess tissue edema, inflammation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) expression, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression, collagen ratio, and MMP-9 activity. The effects of MSCs and their combination with MPFF (diosmin-hesperidin) were evaluated through histological examinations, western blot analysis, and gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Characterization confirmed the MSCs' plastic adherence, osteogenic differentiation potential, and immunophenotype (positive for CD90 and CD29, negative for CD45 and CD31). Treatment with MSCs alone or in combination with MPFF significantly reduced tissue edema, inflammation, TNF-α expression, and MMP-9 activity. Additionally, MSCs increased TGF-β expression, and collagen type I/III ratio, and accelerated wound healing by resolving inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that MSCs play a crucial role in modulating TNF-α, TGF-β, collagen remodeling, and MMP-9 activity, highlighting their promising role in hemorrhoid treatment and wound healing processes. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the intricate mechanisms and optimize MSC-based therapies for clinical applications in hemorrhoidal disease management."

Increasing evidence suggests that hesperidin inhibits the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This article reviews the neuropharmacological mechanisms of hesperidin in the prevention and treatment of AD through in vitro and in vivo studies. A systematic review of preclinical studies was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar (up to July 1, 2024). The neuroprotective potential of hesperidin was mediated through mechanisms such as inhibition of β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, enhancement of endogenous antioxidant defense functions, reduction of neuroinflammation and apoptosis, improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction, regulation of autophagy, and promotion of neurogenesis. Despite various preclinical studies on the role of hesperidin in AD, its exact effects on humans remain unclear. Few clinical trials have indicated that dietary supplements rich in hesperidin can improve cerebral blood flow, cognition, and memory performance. The neuroprotective effect of hesperidin may be exerted via regulating different molecular pathways, including the RAGE/NF-κB, Akt/Nrf2, and AMPK/BDNF/CREB pathways. However, further clinical trials are needed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of this natural flavonoid compound and to assess its safety.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the potential therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of hesperidin treatment on cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, key stages of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) were treated with 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2) alone or in combination with 1.56 μM hesperidin for 48 h. The impact of treatment on cell migration was evaluated using a wound healing assay. Apoptosis was assessed using DNA staining. mRNA and protein expression were evaluated using real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Hesperidin inhibits the proliferation and transformation of the cells by inducing apoptosis and reverses the cell morphology modified by TGF-β2. Hesperidin inhibits cell migration induced by TGF-β2. Upon treatment with hesperidin, the levels of mesenchymal markers upregulated by TGF-β2, such as MMP-1, -2, -9, fibronectin, α-SMA and the transcription factors Snail, Slug and ZEB-1, were downregulated. Conversely, the epithelial marker E-cadherin is upregulated with hesperidin treatment. Additionally, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression levels, which are downregulated, increase with the treatment. These results suggest that hesperidin may inhibit the migration and EMT processes of RPE cells involved in the development of PVR, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent for treating PVR.",

For this, 41 participants (30-63 years) were randomly divided into placebo and supplement groups. The supplement group took two capsules daily with AM3, spermidine, and hesperidin for two months, while the placebo group took capsules containing only calcium phosphate and talcum powder. Before and after the treatment, peripheral blood was collected. Immune function was assessed in leukocytes, redox state in whole-blood cells, erythrocytes, and plasma, and cytokine concentration in both mononuclear cell cultures and plasma. Finally, the Immunity Clock model was applied to determine BA. The results show that the intake of this blend improves the immune functions that constitute the Immunity Clock, decreasing BA by 11 years and reducing the oxidative-inflammatory state of the participants. Therefore, this supplement can be proposed as a strategy to rejuvenate BA and achieve healthy aging."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to examine the effects of hesperidin and hesperetin on liver disorders. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is a complicated disorder influenced by many factors, including inflammation, diabetes and obesity. Currently, the most prominent treatment method is lifestyle changes. If left untreated, it can progress to cirrhosis, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. Hesperidin, which is a flavanone glycoside polyphenolic plant compound, belongs to the flavanone class and was first isolated from citrus peel. Hesperidin includes aglycone hesperetin and rutinoside sugar. It is the most dominant form of flavonoid in citrus fruits. In our review, we discuss the effects of these phytochemicals on liver diseases, focusing on their relationship with inflammation, blood sugar regulation and blood lipids. Hesperidin and hesperetin are seen as promising agents for many diseases. Their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties support this view. Although their low water solubility limits their potential effects, many studies have demonstrated their benefits. They are thought to play an effective role in inflammatory processes, particularly in liver diseases. More studies are required to find the optimum dosage and to use them as a therapeutic agent for the liver."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of the natural compound hesperidin in glycolysis, the key ratelimiting enzyme, in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. METHODS: In vitro, HCT116 and SW620 were treated with different doses of hesperidin (0-500 µmol/L), cell counting kit-8 and colone formation assays were utilized to detected inhibition effect of hesperidin on CRC cell lines. Transwell and wound healing assays were performed to detect the ability of hesperidin (0, 25, 50 and 75 µmol/L) to migrate CRC cells. To confirm the apoptotic-inducing effect of hesperidin, apoptosis and cycle assays were employed. Western blot, glucose uptake, and lactate production determination measurements were applied to determine inhibitory effects of hesperidin (0, 25 and 50 µmol/L) on glycolysis. In vivo, according to the random number table method, nude mice with successful tumor loading were randomly divided into vehicle, low-dose hesperidin (20 mg/kg) and high-dose hesperidin (60 mg/kg) groups, with 6 mice in each group. The body weights and tumor volumes of mice were recorded during 4-week treatment. The expression of key glycolysis rate-limiting enzymes was determined using Western blot, and glucose uptake and lactate production were assessed. Finally, protein interactions were probed with DirectDIA Quantitative Proteomics, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. RESULTS: Hesperidin could inhibit CRC cell line growth (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Moreover, hesperidin presented an inhibitory effect on the migrating abilities of CRC cells. Hesperidin also promoted apoptosis and cell cycle alterations (P<0.05). The immunoblotting results manifested that hesperidin decreased the levels of hexokinase 2, glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1), GLUT3, L-lactate dehydrogenase A, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2), PFKFB3, and pyruvate kinase isozymes M2 (P<0.01). It remarkably suppressed tumor xenograft growth in nude mice. GO and KEGG analyses showed that hesperidin treatment altered metabolic function. CONCLUSION: Hesperidin inhibits glycolysis and is a potential therapeutic choice for CRC treatment."

Hesperidin (HSD) has an antioxidant function that can mitigate oxidative stress, thereby promoting hippocampal neurogenesis. Because brain function and memory are reliant on hippocampal neurogenesis, this work is planned to elucidate the effects of HSD on the VPA-induced alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis and apoptosis via oxidative damage. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped into the vehicle, VPA, HSD, and VPA + HSD groups. After administration, the hippocampi and prefrontal cortex were harvested for p21 staining, assessment of MDA, CAT, SOD, and GPx, and Western blotting analysis of Nrf2, Bax, caspase3, and Bcl-2 proteins. The results exhibited a significantly elevated level of p21-positive cells in VPA-treated rats, indicating cell cycle arrest in hippocampal neurogenesis. Additionally, our findings demonstrated a notable rise in oxidative stress, a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity and the transcription factor Nrf2 in VPA-treated rats. Furthermore, VPA induced apoptotic activities, as substantiated by the upregulation of Bax and caspase3, and the downregulation of Bcl-2. These findings demonstrate that HSD can reduce oxidative stress levels, thereby mitigating the arrest of the cell cycle and apoptotic activity induced by VPA treatment in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.",

In this study, we utilized a thorough in-silico and in-vitro methodology to develop prospective drugs for the treatment of lung cancer. The active components of Citrus latifolia were identified through the utilization of a variety of pharmacological instruments, such as Gene Ontology, GeneCards, DrugBank, the Chinese Traditional Drug Database, and GeneMANIA. Subsequent molecular docking studies using GOLD software revealed Hesperidin as the most promising candidate, exhibiting a remarkable binding affinity (GOLD score: 60.98 kcal/mol) towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a pivotal target in lung cancer therapy. Further validation through Schrodinger-Glide redocking reaffirmed the robust interaction between Hesperidin and EGFR. Pharmacokinetic profiling of top-scoring ligands indicated favorable drug-like properties, supporting their therapeutic potential. Molecular dynamics simulations employing Desmond software demonstrated the structural stability and persistence of the Hesperidin-EGFR complex over a 100-ns trajectory, corroborating its efficacy. Additionally, cytotoxicity analysis revealed a potent inhibitory effect of Hesperidin with an IC50 value of 34.25 µg/ml. Collectively, our findings underscore Hesperidin from Citrus latifolia as a promising candidate for lung cancer therapy, warranting further investigation through in-vivo studies for clinical translation."

Materials and Methods: Forty adult male Wistar rats were used in this study. Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin (STZ), and the rats were divided into control, diabetes and saline-treated, diabetes and diosmin + hesperidin (150 mg/kg) treated, and diabetes and diosmin + hesperidin (300 mg/kg) treated groups. Electromyography (EMG) and inclined plane testing were performed to assess nerve function and motor performance. Sciatic nerve sections were examined histopathologically. Plasma levels of FGF21, galectin-3, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured as markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Results: Diabetic rats treated with saline displayed reduced nerve conduction parameters and impaired motor performance compared to controls. Treatment with diosmin and hesperidin significantly improved compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, distal latency, and motor performance in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological examination revealed decreased perineural thickness in treated groups. Additionally, treatment with diosmin and hesperidin resulted in increased plasma FGF21 levels and reduced plasma levels of galectin-3 and MDA, indicating decreased oxidative stress and inflammation. Conclusions: Diosmin and hesperidin exhibited protective effects in diabetic neuropathy by promoting nerve regeneration, enhancing nerve conduction, and improving motor performance. These effects were associated with modulation of the FGF21 and galectin-3 pathway. These findings suggest that diosmin and hesperidin may hold potential as adjunctive therapies for diabetic neuropathy.",

The present study aims to assess the efficacy of Hesperidin as a feed additive in promoting gastrointestinal motility and elucidating its underlying mechanism. A total of 200 newly hatched (1-day-old) broilers with similar body weight were randomly allocated into 4 groups as follows: the control group receiving only the basal diet, and the other 3 groups supplemented with 50, 100, and 150 mg of hesperidin per kg of the basal diet, respectively. Each group consisted of 5 replicates with ten broilers per replicate, and the feeding trial lasted for a duration of 21 d. At 21 d of age, a 5% w/v Evans Blue solution in distilled water was utilized to measure intestinal transit rates (ITR). Gastric emptying (GE) was evaluated by administering a phenol red solution at a concentration of 0.05% w/v (1 mL/broiler). Fifteen broilers from each group were euthanized and immediately dissected to obtain gizzard, hypothalamus, duodenum, and jugular blood samples. Jugular blood samples were collected for brain-gut peptide content analysis, while gizzard, hypothalamus, and duodenum samples were used for immunohistochemical analysis. Real-time qPCR was performed on gizzard samples. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in the GE and ITR of broilers in all treatment groups compared to the control group (P < 0.05), particularly in the 100mg/Kg and 150mg/Kg hesperidin group. Incorporation of hesperidin into the broilers' diet significantly enhances serum levels of ghrelin, encompassing serotonin (5-HT), motilin (MTL), cholecystokinin (CCK), and Stem Cell Factor (SCF) as well as substance P (SP) in the gizzard and duodenal tissues while reducing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels (P < 0.05). The group administered a dosage of 150mg/Kg exhibited the most pronounced effect.Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that hesperidin supplementation up-regulated SP protein content and down-regulated VIP protein content in the hypothalamus, gizzard, and duodenum of broilers (P < 0.05), with the most pronounced effect illustrated in the 150mg/Kg hesperidin group. Furthermore, addition of hesperidin to broiler feed resulted in a significant up-regulation of protein expression and gene expression related to SCF and The protein expression of Receptor tyrosine kinase (C-Kit) was significantly upregulated in the 150mg/Kg group, while the gene expression of C-Kit was significantly upregulated in the 50 mg/Kg group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, hesperidin exhibits promising potential as a feed additive for broilers, as its dietary supplementation of hesperidin improves gastrointestinal motility through modulation of both \"gut-brain axis\" signaling pathways and \"SCF/C-Kit signaling pathways\" within broiler chicken's digestive system. Notably, basal diet supplemented with 150mg/Kg hesperidin demonstrates superior efficacy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer, causing worldwide mortality. Therefore, this study is necessary for continuing research into new effective and safe treatments. Recently, herbal medicines have been used for the treatment of various diseases such as cancer. This study aimed to investigate the potential anti-proliferative activity and investigate the mechanisms of hesperidin extract on the non-small lung cancer cells A549 and H460 vs. cisplatin via targeting the miR 34a/PD-L1/NF-κB signalling pathway. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To determine the cytotoxic effects of the hesperidin extract on non-small lung cancer cells, sulphorhdamine B assay was performed. To show the inhibition of migration by hesperidin extract, wound healing assay was conducted. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction test was used to quantify the expressions of miR-34a, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PDL-1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and P53 genes, which are involved in apoptosis pathway. Also, cell cycle assay was performed by using a flow cytometer. RESULTS: The hesperidin extract could significantly inhibit proliferation of non-small lung cancer cells A549 and H460. Western blot assay demonstrated that hesperidin induced suppression of nuclear factor κB signalling pathway. The messenger RNA expression levels of MiR-34a and P53 were up-regulated significantly by hesperidin treatment, while the EGFR and P53 genes were down-regulated. The flow cytometer confirmed that cell cycle arrest occurred at the sub-G1 and G2 phases in A549 and H460, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that hesperidin extract could significantly inhibit non-small lung cancer cell growth by induction of the apoptosis signalling pathway. Therefore, hesperidin might open novel strategies for effective and safe cancer treatment and reduce the adverse side effects of several chemotherapeutic treatments such as cisplatin."

Phytochemical flavonoids have a variety of biological activities, among which there may be safe and effective anti-obesity solutions. METHODS: We tested a plant-derived flavonoid hesperidin and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to alleviate diet-induced obesity. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were treated with hesperidin (100 and 200 mg/kg BW) and FMT. RESULTS: Results indicated that hesperidin had the effects of reducing obesity as indicated by reduction of body weight, fat accumulation and blood lipids, reducing inflammation as indicated by reduction of pro-inflammation factors including TNFα, IL-6, IL-1βand iNOS, and improving gut integrity as indicated by increasing colon length, reducing plasma gut permeability indicators iFABP and LBP, increased mRNA expression of mucus protein Muc2, tight junction p Claudin 2, Occludin and ZO-1 in the HFD-fed mice. The anti-obesity effects of hesperidin treatment have a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 16S rRNA-based gut microbiota analysis revealed that hesperidin selectively promoted the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius, Staphylococcus sciuri and Desulfovibrio C21_c20 while inhibiting Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Mucispirillum schaedleri, Helicobacter ganmani and Helicobacter hepaticus in the HFD-fed mice. Horizontal feces transfer from the normal diet (ND)-fed mice to the HFD-fed mice conferred anti-obesity effects and transmitted some of the HFD-modulated microbes. CONCLUSION: We concluded that hesperidin and FMT both affect the reduction of body weight and improve HFD-related disorders in the HFD-fed mice possibly through modulating the composition of the gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "Hesperidin (Hes) functions as a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory to guard against damage to the heart, liver, and kidneys. Nevertheless, due to its restricted solubility and bioavailability, a delivery method is required for it to reach a specific organ. In this study, ion gelation was used to synthesize a chitosan/hesperidin nanoformulation. Numerous characterization techniques, such as zeta potential, particle size, XRD, TEM, SEM, and FTIR analyses, were used to corroborate the synthesis of hesperidin nanoparticles (Hes-NPs). Male albino mice were given a pretreatment dose of 100 mg/kg, PO, of Hes or Hes-NPs, which was administered daily for 14 days before the induction of doxorubicin nephrotoxicity on the 12th day. Kidney function (urea and creatinine levels) was measured. Lipid peroxidation (MDA) and antioxidant enzyme (CAT and SOD) activities were estimated. TNF-α, IL-1β, and VEGF content; histopathological examination of kidney tissue; and immunohistochemical staining of NF-κB, Caspase-3, BAX, Bcl-2, and TGF-β1 were evaluated. The gene expressions of Sirt-1, Bcl-2, VEGF, HIF1-α, and Kim-1 were also considered. The results showed that pretreatment with Hes or Hes-NPs reduced doxorubicin's nephrotoxic effects, with Hes-NPs showing the greatest reduction. Kidney enzyme and MDA content were lowered in response to the Hes or Hes-NP pretreatment, whereas antioxidant enzyme activities were increased. Hes or Hes-NP pretreatment suppressed the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, VEGF, NF-κB, Caspase-3, BAX, and TGF-β1; however, pretreatment increased Bcl-2 protein levels. Furthermore, the gene expressions of Sirt-1, Bcl-2, VEGF, HIF1-α, and Kim-1 were considerably higher with Hes-NP than with Hes treatment. These results suggest that Hes-NP treatment might reduce DOX-induced nephrotoxicity in mice via modulating Sirt-1/HIF1-α/VEGF/NF-κB signaling to provide antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects."

The control group was given a normal diet devoid of GLP and HES, the HES group was given 100 mg/kg/day HES with the normal diet, the GLP group was given GLP at the LD50/10 dose of normal feed, which was 787.85 mg/kg/day, and the GLP + HES group was given normal feed containing 787.85 mg/kg/day LD50/10 dose of GLP in addition to 100 mg/kg/day HES. GLP administration reduced sperm motility, sperm plasma membrane integrity, glutathione levels, and total antioxidant levels in the testicular tissues of rats. Moreover, it caused an increase in right testis and left epididymis weights, abnormal sperm counts, malondialdehyde levels, total oxidant status, and DNA damage. The HES treatment showed curative effects on these parameters. Furthermore, HES was effective in lessening the histopathological damage that was caused by GLP. The results showedthat HES protects spermatological parameters and DNA integrity, improves antioxidant defenses, and lowers the damage and lipid peroxidation caused by GLP in testicular tissue."

Identifying interventions that can prevent these adverse effects without undermining anticancer efficacy is crucial. This study investigates the efficacy of Thymoquinone (TQ) and Hesperidin (HESP) in preventing cardiotoxicity induced by 5-FU in Wistar rats and elucidates the molecular interactions through docking studies. We employed an experimental design involving multiple groups of Wistar rats exposed to 5-FU, with and without the concurrent administration of TQ and HESP. Cardiac function markers, oxidative stress indicators, and inflammatory markers were assessed. Additionally, molecular docking was used to analyze the interaction of TQ and HESP with key inflammatory proteins. Treatment with TQ and HESP not only lowered levels of cardiac enzymes but also improved antioxidant capacity and reduced inflammation in cardiac tissues. Notably, the combination of TQ and HESP provided more significant protective effects than either agent alone. Molecular docking supported these findings, showing effective binding of TQ and HESP to inflammatory targets. TQ and HESP demonstrate potential as protective agents against cardiotoxicity in 5-FU-treated rats, with their combined use offering enhanced protection. These findings suggest a viable strategy for reducing cardiac risks associated with 5-FU chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "Young women suffering from premature ovarian failure after radiotherapy carry a huge burden in the field of cancer therapy including reproductive loss, emotional stress, and physical troubles that reduce their long-term quality of life. Hesperidin (HSP) exhibited antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. HSP enhanced in vitro follicular maturation and preserved in vivo ovarian stockpile. In this research, the role of HSP in radiation-induced POF in rats was investigated besides ascertaining its underlying mechanisms. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were arbitrarily allocated into four groups: control-group, ϒ-irradiated-group (3.2 Gy once on the 7th day), HSP-group (100 mg/kg, orally for 10 days), and HSP/ϒ-irradiated-group (ϒ-radiation was applied one hour after HSP). At the end of experiment, the whole ovaries were collected for histological and biochemical analyses. Administration of HSP preserved the ovarian histoarchitecture and follicular stock, retained ovarian weight, and conserved serum estradiol and AMH levels following radiation exposure. HSP ameliorated the ovarian oxidative damage mediated by radiation through augmenting the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase antioxidant enzymes. HSP exhibited remarkable anti-inflammatory activity by downregulating the expression of ovarian TLR-4, NF-ĸB, and TNF-α. Moreover, HSP suppressed the apoptotic machinery triggered by radiation by reducing p53 and Bax while increasing Bcl-2 mRNA expressions alongside diminishing caspase-3 expression. Additionally, HSP regulated estrous cycle disorder of irradiated rats and improved their reproductive capacity reflected by enhancing pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, HSP represents an appealing candidate as an adjunct remedy for female cancer patients during radiotherapy protocols owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and hormone-regulatory effects.",

This study aims to evaluate the gastroprotective effects of free hesperidin and its chitosan nanoparticles (HNPs) against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats, hypothesizing that HNPs will enhance bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy due to improved solubility and targeted delivery. HNPs were synthesized via ion gelation and characterized using TEM, SEM, and zeta potential analyses. Key assessments included gastric acidity, histological analysis, and markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. HNPs significantly decreased gastric acidity, reduced inflammatory and apoptotic markers, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities compared to free hesperidin and esomeprazole. Furthermore, Sirt-1, PGC-1α, HO-1, and FOXO1 gene expression were also evaluated. HNPs raised Sirt-1, PGC-1α, HO-1, and downregulated FOXO1, and they suppressed the activities of NF-κB p65, COX-2, IL-1β, CD86, FOXO1 P53, and caspase-3 and increased Sirt-1 activity. HNPs treatment notably restored antioxidant enzyme activity, reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, and improved histological outcomes more effectively than free hesperidin and esomeprazole. These results indicate that chitosan nanoparticles significantly enhance the gastroprotective effects of hesperidin against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers, potentially offering a more effective therapeutic strategy. Further research should explore the clinical applications of HNPs in human subjects."

The role of citrus flavanone hesperidin consumption on cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVDRFs) has been examined in many clinical trials, but conflicting results have been found. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of hesperidin extracts or purified hesperidin on CVDRFs in humans with an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines, we systematically screened and searched electronic databases from their establishment to March 2023. Reference lists and previous reviews were also searched. Intervention trials assessing hesperidin consumption on CVD outcomes were included for pooling. To assess the quality of the included articles, the tool of Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was applied. We synthesized the effect sizes with 95% CIs and weighted mean difference (WMD). The I 2 index was used to evaluate the between-study heterogeneity. To explore the heterogeneity source, we used meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also performed. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to evaluate the evidence quality. RESULTS: We included 12 trials with 589 participants. We found evident effects of hesperidin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD: -0.22 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.33, -0.11 mmol/L), total cholesterol (WMD: -0.20 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.31, -0.08 mmol/L), fasting blood glucose (WMD: -0.15 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.29, -0.02 mg/dL), quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (WMD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (WMD: -13.60 ng/mL; 95% CI: -23.72, -3.48 ng/mL), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (WMD: -15.60 ng/mL; 95% CI: -30.13, -1.06 ng/mL), and C-reactive protein (WMD: -0.56 mg/L; 95% CI: -1.11, -0.01 mg/L), whereas no effects were found for other CVDRFs. CONCLUSIONS: Our current findings demonstrate that hesperidin might be advantageous in improving numerous CVDRFs in humans, such as blood lipid concentrations, blood glucose control, and management of inflammatory indicators."

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID) is a potentially serious side effect that often occurs during anticancer therapy and is caused by the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in increased frequency of bowel movements and fluid contents. Among these agents, irinotecan (CPT-11) is most commonly associated with CID. Hesperidin (HPD), a flavonoid glycoside found predominantly in citrus fruits, has anti-oxidation properties and anti-inflammation properties that may benefit CID management. Nevertheless, its potential mechanism is still uncertain. In this study, we firstly evaluated the pharmacodynamics of HPD for the treatment of CID in a mouse model, then used network pharmacology and molecular docking methods to excavate the mechanism of HPD in relieving CID, and finally further proved the predicted mechanism through molecular biology experiments. The results demonstrate that HPD significantly alleviated diarrhea, weight loss, colonic pathological damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation in CID mice. In addition, 74 potential targets for HPD intervention in CID were verified by network pharmacology, with the top 10 key targets being AKT1, CASP3, ALB, EGFR, HSP90AA1, MMP9, ESR1, ANXA5, PPARG, and IGF1. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that the PI3K-Akt pathway, FoxO pathway, MAPK pathway, TNF pathway, and Ras pathway were most relevant to the HPD potential treatment of CID genes. The molecular docking results showed that HPD had good binding to seven apoptosis-related targets, including AKT1, ANXA5, CASP3, HSP90AA1, IGF1, MMP9, and PPARG. Moreover, we verified apoptosis by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and immunohistochemistry, and the hypothesis about the proteins above was further verified by Western blotting in vivo experiments. Overall, this study elucidates the potential and underlying mechanisms of HPD in alleviating CID.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) can lead to disc herniation and spinal instability, sometimes requiring surgical intervention. Currently, estrogen has a potential protective effect on IDD, and estrogen is associated with an increased risk of some cancers, such as breast and endometrial cancer. Therefore, it is important to identify natural compounds that estrogen analogues treat IDD while reducing the risk of tumor development. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore a natural metabolic treatment strategy by targeting CRISP2 with the natural compound Hesperidin to mimic the protective effects of estrogen on IDD and reduce the risk of tumor development. METHODS: Microarray data from healthy volunteers and IDD patients were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and RNA sequencing and clinical data from various cancer types were analyzed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the Bioconductor Limma package, followed by principal component analysis, volcano plot, and heatmap visualization. Additionally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA immune cell infiltration assessments, survival analysis, metabolite enrichment analysis, and molecular docking were performed. Hesperidin's interaction with CRISP2 was further validated through molecular docking and experimental studies. RESULTS: Hesperidin significantly reduced the expression of CRISP2, iNOS, and COX2 in IDD models, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis, and diminished inflammatory markers. CIBERSORT and ssGSEA analyses revealed a correlation between CRISP2 and immune cell infiltration. Survival analysis demonstrated that CRISP2 expression levels were associated with patient survival across various cancer types. Hesperidin was found to mimic estrogen's effects on IDD and reduce tumor progression. Cell culture and experimental validation confirmed Hesperidin's protective effects on nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). CONCLUSION: Hesperidin, as a potential natural metabolic regulator, not only has therapeutic effects on IDD but may also synergize with estrogen therapy to promote spinal health without increasing cancer risk. This study presents a new clinical approach for IDD treatment and lays the foundation for further drug development and experimental research."

      "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effects of hesperidin (Hes), thymol (Thy), rosmarinic acid (RA) and their combined effect on broiler growth performance, intestinal barrier function, and cecal microbiota. A total of 240 newly hatched Arbor Acres broiler chicks were randomly divided into 5 treatments with 6 replicates of 8 chickens. The birds were fed a basal diet (Con group), a basal diet supplemented with 40 mg/kg Hes (Hes group), a basal diet supplemented with 40 mg/kg Thy (Thy group), a basal diet supplemented with 20 mg/kg RA (RA group), or a basal diet supplemented with 40 mg/kg Hes + 40 mg/kg Thy + 20 mg/kg RA (HTR group) for 42 d. The results indicated that dietary Hes and HTR supplementation enhanced average daily gain, final body weight, and eviscerated yield of broilers compared with the Con group (P < 0.05). Notably, the HTR treatment showed a decrease in abdominal fat yield and ratio of feed to weight gain (P < 0.05). HTR treatment increased ileal villus height, villus height/crypt depth, and number of goblet cells, decreased the crypt depth (P < 0.05), up-regulated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-1, Occludin) and MUC2 (P < 0.05). Hes, Thy, RA, HTR treatment decreased the concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-8, IFN-γ and TNF-α), and down-regulated the mRNA expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB (P < 0.05). Importantly, the supplementation of HTR increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (Parabacteroides, Lachnosiraceae NK4A136 and Turicbacter) and significantly decreased the relative abundance of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Colidextribacter (P < 0.05). Additionally, the concentrations of propionate and butyrate in the cecum were elevated in the HTR group (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that the diet supplemented with HTR improved the growth performance and intestinal barrier function in broilers by modulating the cecal microbiota and its metabolites.",

This situation imposes a great burden on individuals, both economically and socially. Today, an effective method for treating the disease and protective approach to tau accumulation has not been developed yet. Studies have been conducted on the effects of hesperidin and naringin flavonoids found in citrus fruits on many diseases. METHODS: In this review, the pathophysiology of AD is defined, and the effects of hesperidin and naringin on these factors are summarized. RESULTS: Studies have shown that both components may potentially affect AD due to their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Based on these effects of the components, it has been shown that they may have ameliorative effects on Aβ, α-synuclein aggregation, tau pathology, and cognitive functions in the pathophysiology of AD. DISCUSSION: There are studies suggesting that hesperidin and naringin may be effective in the prevention/treatment of AD. When these studies are examined, it is seen that more studies should be conducted on the subject.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In all age, FoShou as a Chinese medicinal herb has been active in various kinds of Traditional Chinese medicine formula to treating diabetes. Hesperidin (HES), the main monomeric component of FoShou, has been extensively investigated for interventions with pathogenic mechanism of diabetes as well as subsequent treatment of associated complications. Islet β-cells have an essential effect on dynamically regulating blood sugar. Functional abnormalities in these cells and their death are strongly associated with the onset of diabetes. Therefore, induction of islet endocrine cell lineage re-editing for damaged βcell replenishment would be a promising therapeutic tool. Previously, it has been found that HES can protect islet β-cells in vivo, But, the regenerative function of HES in islet β cells and its role in promoting differential non-β cells transdifferentiation into β cells and cell fate rewriting associated mechanisms remain unclear.This work focused on investigating whether HES can induce islet α cells transdifferentiation into β cells for achieving damaged β cell regeneration and the causes and possible mechanisms involved in the process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In brief, 60 mg/kg/d streptozotocin (STZ) was administered intraperitoneally in each male C57bL/6J mouse raised by the high-sugar and high-fat diet (HFD) to create a diabetic mouse model with severe β-cell damage. After 28 consecutive days of HES treatment (160 mg/kg; 320 mg/kg; once daily, as appropriate). Tracing the dynamics of α as well as β cell transformation, together with β cells growth and apoptosis levels during treatment by cell lineage tracing. The self-enforcing transcriptional network on which the cell lineage is based is used as a clue to explore the underlying mechanisms. Guangdong Pharmaceutical University's Animal Experiment Ethics Committee (GDPulac2019180) approved all animal experiments. RESULTS: Localization by cell lineage we find that transdifferentiated newborn β-cells derived from α cells appeared in the islet endocrine cell mass of DM mice under HES'action. Compared to the model group, expressed by Tunel staining and CXCL10 levels the overall apoptosis rate of β-cells of the pancreas were reduced,the inflammatory infiltration feedback from HE staining were lower.Ki-67 positive cells showed enhanced β-cell proliferation. Decreased HbA1c and blood glucose contents, elevated C-Peptide and insulin contents which respond to ability of nascent beta cells. Also upregulated the mRNA levels of MafA, Ngn3, PDX-1, Pax4 and Arx. Moreover, increased the expression of TGR5/cAMP-CREB/GLP-1 in mouse intestinal tissues and GLP-1/GLP-1R and cAMP-CREB/IRS2/PDX-1 in pancreatic tissues. CONCLUSIONS: HES directly affects β-cells, apart from being anti-apoptotic and reducing inflammatory infiltration. HES promotes GLP-1 release by intestinal L cells by activating the TGR5 receptor in DM mouse and regulating its response element CREB signaling. GLP-1 then uses the GLP-1/GLP-1R system to act on IRS2, IRS2 as a port to influence α precursor cells to express PDX-1, with the mobilization of Pax4 strong expression than Arx so that α cell lineage is finally reversed for achieving β cell endogenous proliferation."

      "abstract": "In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a highly heterogeneous ecosystem that exerts indispensable roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) are the main matrix components in the TIME of TNBC. CAFs mediate the edesmoplastic response, which is a major driver of the immunosuppressive microenvironment to promote tumor growth. In addition, CAAs, a type of tumor-educated adipocyte, participate in crosstalk with breast cancer and are capable of secreting various cytokines, adipokines and chemokines, especially C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2), resulting in changes of cancer cell phenotype and function. Therefore, how to treat tumors by regulating the CAFs and the secretion of CCL2 by CAAs in TIME is investigated here. Our research group previously found that rhein (Rhe) has been identified as effective against CAFs, while hesperidin (Hes) could effectively diminish CCL2 secretion by CAAs. Inspired by the above, we developed unique PLGA-based nanoparticles loaded with Rhe and Hes (RH-NP) using the emulsion solvent diffusion method. The RH-NP particles have an average size of 114.1 ± 0.98 nm. RH-NP effectively reduces CAFs and inhibits CCL2 secretion by CAAs, promoting increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and reducing immunosuppressive cell presence within tumors. This innovative, safe, low-toxic, and highly effective anti-tumor strategy could be prospective in TNBC treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the pharmacological impact of hesperidin, the main component of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, on depressive behavior and elucidate the mechanism by which hesperidin treats depression, focusing on the gut-brain axis. METHODS: Fifty-four Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly allocated to 6 groups using a random number table, including control, model, hesperidin, probiotics, fluoxetine, and Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium groups. Except for the control group, rats in the remaining 5 groups were challenged with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 21 days and housed in single cages. The sucrose preference test (SPT), immobility time in the forced swim test (FST), and number in the open field test (OFT) were performed to measure the behavioral changes in the rats. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in brain tissue, and the histopathology was performed to evaluate the changes of colon tissue, together with sequencing of the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene on feces to explore the changes of intestinal flora in the rats. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the rats in the model group showed notable reductions in body weight, SPF, and number in OFT (P<0.01). Hesperidin was found to ameliorate depression induced by CUMS, as seen by improvements in body weight, SPT, immobility time in FST, and number in OFT (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Regarding neurotransmitters, it was found that at a dose of 50 mg/kg hesperidin treatment upregulated the levels of 5-HT and BDNF in depressed rats (P<0.05). Compared to the control group, the colon tissue of the model group exhibited greater inflammatory cell infiltration, with markedly reduced numbers of goblet cells and crypts and were significantly improved following treatment with hesperidin. Simultaneously, the administration of hesperidin demonstrated a positive impact on the gut microbiome of rats treated with CUMS, such as Shannon index increased and Simpson index decreased (P<0.01), while the abundance of Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota increased in the hesperidin-treated group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of hesperidin on depressive behavior in rats may be related to inhibition of the expressions of BDNF and 5-HT and preservation of the gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "Unicellular protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani is the causative agent for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or Kala-azar, a neglected fatal parasitic disease. The conventional treatment of VL consists of therapeutic agents having several shortcomings such as toxicity, high cost, efficacy variance and increased drug resistance. Therefore, there is a desperate need to develop an effective treatment against the parasite. Previous reports suggested that flavonoids can inhibit the enzyme Leishmania donovani DNA topoisomerase I (LdTopILS). Therefore, for the first time in this present study, we divulge HSP (one of the natural sources of flavonoids), as a potent natural antileishmanial compound with efficacy in BALB/c mice at 20 mg/kg of body weight, inhibits LdTopILS at 97 % of its activity at 160 μM in preincubation condition (competitively). It binds with free enzyme and does not allow it to bind with the substrate DNA. Moreover, HSP does not stabilize DNA-topoisomerase I cleavable complex. Thus, HSP acts a catalytic topoisomerase I inhibitor, which inhibits complete activity by binding with Lys269 and Thr411 of large subunit of the enzyme. On the other hand, HSP induces the topo I-mediated programmed cell death process by the formation of cellular reactive oxygen species, resulting in depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by fragmentation of nuclear DNA. Therefore, the present study illuminates a natural flavonoid that in future might be a promising lead for the treatment of VL.",

      "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) was asked to deliver an opinion on glucosyl hesperidin (GH) as a novel food (NF) pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283. The NF, which is produced from hesperidin and dextrin by enzymatic reactions, is a powder consisting mainly of monoglucosyl hesperidin (MGH) and unreacted hesperidin (flavonoid), which account in total for up to 92.8% (on dry basis) of the product. The applicant proposed to use the NF in specific drinks and food supplements leading to a maximum intake of up to 364 mg per day for adults. The target population is the general population, except for food supplements for which the proposed target population is children from 1 year onwards and adults. Taking into consideration the composition of the NF and the proposed uses, the consumption of the NF is not nutritionally disadvantageous. There are no concerns regarding genotoxicity of the NF. Based on a 90-day oral toxicity study conducted with the NF, the Panel considers the NOAEL at the mid-dose group, i.e. ~ 1000 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. By applying an uncertainty factor of 200, the resulting intake providing sufficient margin of exposure for humans would be 5 mg/kg bw per day. The available human intervention studies did not report clinically relevant changes in haematological or clinical chemistry parameters following the administration of GH/MGH at supplemental doses of up to 3 g/day for 12 weeks. Overall, the Panel considers that the margin of exposure (~ 200) between the intake of the NF at the proposed uses and use levels and the NOAEL from the 90-day study is sufficient. The Panel concludes that the NF, glucosyl hesperidin, is safe for the target population at the proposed uses and use levels."

Cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) play an active role in tumor development, invasion and metastasis, and response to treatment by secreting various cytokines. CAAs secrete CCL2 and ADPN which significantly affect the efficacy of aPD-1 in treating breast cancer. Our recent research has demonstrated that Hesperidin, a natural phenolic compound, significantly inhibits CCL2, elevates ADPN secreted by CAAs in vitro and in vivo, remodels the immune microenvironment, and potentiates the efficacy of aPD-1 in triple-negative breast cancer. We used Oil red staining, Bodipy 493/503 staining and quantitative real-time PCR to verify the formation of CAAs. ELISA was used to detect levels of CCL2, ADPN secreted by CAAs. Changes in the number of immune cells in mouse tumor tissues were detected using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Our data suggest that Hesperidin PLGA nanoparticles significantly reduced CCL2 and increased ADPN secreted by CAAs, which concurrently decreased the recruitment of M2 macrophages, Tregs and MDSCs while increased the infiltration of CD8+T cells, M1 macrophages and DCs into tumor, thus significantly potentiated the efficacy of aPD-1 in vivo. This study provides a new combined strategy for the clinical treatment of triple-negative breast cancer by interfering with CCL2, ADPN secreted by CAAs to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the toxic effect of TBA exposure on chicken hepatocytes and the therapeutic effect of HSP on the TBA-induced hepatotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that HSP could alleviate TBA exposure-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Interestingly, TBA significantly disrupted the integrity of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM), while HSP treatment showed the opposite tendency. In addition, TBA could significantly trigger ferroptosis in liver, and HSP treatment reversed ferroptosis under TBA exposure.

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hesperidin on the liver and kidney dysfunctions induced by nickel. The mice were divided into six groups: nickel treatment with 80 mg/kg, 160 mg/kg, 320 mg/kg hesperidin groups, 0.5% CMC-Na group, nickel group, and blank control group. Histopathological techniques, biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and the TUNEL method were used to study the changes in structure, functions, oxidative injuries, and apoptosis of the liver and kidney. The results showed that hesperidin could alleviate the weight loss and histological injuries of the liver and kidney induced by nickel, and increase the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) in liver and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) and N-acetylglucosidase (NAG) in kidney. In addition, hesperidin could increase the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the liver and kidney, decrease the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and inhibit cell apoptosis. It is suggested that hesperidin could help inhibit the toxic effect of nickel on the liver and kidney."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent neurodegenerative disease within dementias, affects the CNS, leading to gradual memory issues and cognitive dysfunction. Oxidative stress in AD contributes to ongoing neuronal loss and hastens disease progression. Notably, the potent antioxidant compounds morin and hesperidin have demonstrated significant effectiveness in addressing oxidative stress. This study explores the impact of morin and hesperidin on behavior and oxidative stress in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD rat model. The experiment involved five groups: control, STZ, STZ+morin, STZ+hesperidin, and STZ+morin+hesperidin. The rat model of AD was created by injecting STZ with the stereotaxic surgery. Morin and hesperidin were applied to the groups for 7-days. After the applications, the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests were used and the rats were sacrificed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NOx), and protein carbonyl (PC) levels were measured. In the STZ group, the levels of NOx and PC exhibited a noteworthy increase compared to the control. Conversely, the application of morin and/or hesperidin treatments reduced NOx and PC levels compared to the STZ group. The co-administration of morin and hesperidin improved the antioxidant status and decreased lipid peroxidation in STZ-induced rats. In the STZ group, serum advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels were statistically elevated compared to the control. However, in the treatment groups, morin and/or hesperidin successfully decreased AOPP levels to those observed in the control. The combined use of these flavonoids may have a neuroprotective effect regarding memory problems and decreasing oxidative/nitrosative stress.",

The efficacy of flavonoids for treating PCS symptoms is still a matter of debate, and little has been published. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a mixture of diosmin, troxerutin, and hesperidin in improving symptoms of patients with PCS, observing a direct effect on circulation by specific color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) evaluations. METHODS: This was a pilot, prospective, independent, cross-over, daily-diary-based trial. Women were evaluated with CDU for 3 times (baseline, 60 days, 120 days). Data about N.=13 women who completed the study were analyzed. RESULTS: During the treatment, we recorded a significant reduction of intermenstrual and menstrual pain intensity (total points) (P<0.05). The satisfaction after treatment was significantly higher than after placebo (P<0.0001). A significant reduction in the diameter of the major ovarian vein (P=0.004 compared to placebo), associated with an increase in peak systolic velocity (P=0.01) and a corresponding significant increase in the Resistivity Index (P<0.0001) were recorded during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a mixture of diosmin, troxerutin and hesperidin in women with PCS can significantly help to manage typical symptoms of pelvic pain and it is associated with an evident Doppler effect on pelvic microcirculation.",

Hesperidin as a polyphenol glycoside, Activates the apoptotic pathway and salinomycin as a k + selective ionophore. We examined how hesperidin and salinomycin induce pro-apoptotic effects in KG1a cells. Cells were divided into four groups; 1) control cells (CRTL), 2) cells treated with hesperidin 85 μM, 3) cells treated with 2 μM salinomycin, 4) cells treated with combination of salinomycin and hesperidin. The MTT assay was implemented to determine the IC50 of hesperidin and salinomycin in KG1a cell lines. Propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry were used to analyze the distribution of the cell cycle. The level of ROS was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy and spectrophotometry. Additionally, Akt, XIAP, Bad, and FOXO1 gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR. Hesperidin/Salinomycin decreased the viability of KG1a leukemic cells more than Hesperidin and Salinomycin separately. Changes in the shape of apoptotic cells and rise in ROS levels were detected after Hesperidin/Salinomycin treatment. Our findings showed that following Hesperidin/Salinomycin treatment, the expression of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway related genes (AKT, PTEN and FOXO1), were in line with the destruction of KG-1a cells. Furthermore, XIAP and BAD mRNA were regulated to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells. The study discovered that hesperidin and salinomycin, could effectively hinder the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in leukemia cancer cells. Also, the combination of hesperidin and salinomycin has the potential to be a treatment option for acute myeloid leukemia."

Flavonoid possess potent antioxidant capacities to mitigate pesticide related cellular injury. The present investigation examined the mitigative effect of micronized purified fractions of diosmin and hesperidin on reproductive hormones, sperm parameters, and testicular glycogen in male Wistar rats after sub-chronic Chlorpyriphos (CPF) exposure. Twenty-five male Wistar rats (120-145 g) were randomly allocated five rats per group. Group I (DW) received distilled water (2 ml/kg), Group II (S/oil) received soya oil (2 ml/kg), Group III (DAF) received Daflon at 1000 mg/kg, Group IV (CPF) received Chlorpyriphos (7.74 mg/kg), and Group V (DAF + CPF) received Daflon (1000 mg/kg) followed by CPF (7.74 mg/kg) after 30 min of Daflon. This regimen was administered daily for 60 days. After cervical venesection under light chloroform anesthesia, blood samples were examined for levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone. Each rat's testicular tissue was quickly cut, collected, and glycogen evaluated. Sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and viability were measured in the right caudal epididymis. Results revealed that the untreated CPF group had significantly lower FSH, LH, testosterone, testicular glycogen, and sperm concentration. Additionally, CPF group sperm characteristics were abnormal compared to other groups. These reproductive hormones, testicular glycogen, and sperm parameters improved in the Daflon-treated groups. Hence, pre-treatment with flavonoid fractions of diosmin and hesperidin mitigated CPF-induced reproductive toxicity.",

This study was conducted to assess the impact of using loratadine or diosmin/hesperidin on neuropathy induced by vinca alkaloids. Patients were randomized into one of three groups as follows: group 1 was the control group, group 2 received 450 mg diosmin and 50 mg hesperidin combination orally twice daily, and group 3 received loratadine 10 mg orally once daily. Subjective scores (numeric pain rating scale, douleur neuropathique 4, and functional assessment of cancer therapy/gynecologic oncology group-neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx) scores), neuroinflammation biomarkers, adverse drug effects, quality of life, and response to chemotherapy were compared among the three groups. Both diosmin/hesperidin and loratadine improved the results of the neurotoxicity subscale in the FACT/GOG-Ntx score (p < 0.001, p < 0.01 respectively) and ameliorated the upsurge in neuroinflammation serum biomarkers. They also reduced the incidence and timing of paresthesia (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) and dysuria occurrence (p = 0.042). Both loratadine and diosmin/hesperidin attenuated the intensity of acute neuropathy triggered by vinca alkaloids.

      "abstract": "In this study, a novel method for the fabrication of hesperidin/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (RGOH) with the assistance of gamma rays is reported. The different RGOHs were obtained by varying hesperidin concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 200 wt.%) in graphene oxide (GO) solution. Hesperidin concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 200 wt.%) in graphene oxide (GO) were varied to produce the various RGOHs. Upon irradiation with 80 kGy from γ-Ray, the successful reduction of GO occurred in the presence of hesperidin. The reduction process was confirmed by different characterization techniques such as FTIR, XRD, HRTEM, and Raman Spectroscopy. A cytotoxicity study using the MTT method was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic-anticancer effects of arbitrary RGOH on Wi38, CaCo2, and HepG2 cell lines. The assessment of RGOH's anti-inflammatory activity, including the monitoring of IL-1B and IL-6 activities as well as NF-kB gene expression was done. In addition, the anti-invasive and antimetastatic properties of RGOH, ICAM, and VCAM were assessed. Additionally, the expression of the MMP2-9 gene was quantified. The assessment of apoptotic activity was conducted by the detection of gene expressions related to BCl2 and P53. The documentation of the JNK/SMAD4/MMP2 signaling pathway was ultimately accomplished. The findings of our study indicate that RGOH therapy has significant inhibitory effects on the JNK/SMAD4/MMP2 pathway. This suggests that it could be a potential therapeutic option for cancer.",

      "abstract": "Melanoma, characterized as the most aggressive and metastatic form of skin cancer, currently has limited treatment options, predominantly chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, the drawbacks associated with parenterally administered chemotherapy underscore the urgent need for alternative compounds to combat melanoma effectively. Hesperidin (HES), a flavonoid present in various citrus fruits, exhibits promising anticancer activity. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of HES is hindered by challenges such as poor water solubility, a short half-life, and low oral bioavailability. In response to these limitations, we introduced a novel approach by formulating HES-loaded exosomes (Exo-HES). Isolation of exosomes was achieved through the ultracentrifugation method, and HES was efficiently loaded using the sonication method. The resulting formulations displayed a desirable particle size (∼106 nm) and exhibited a spherical morphology, as confirmed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. In vitro studies conducted on B16F10 cell lines demonstrated higher cytotoxicity of Exo-HES compared to free HES, supported by enhanced cellular uptake validated through coumarin-6-loaded exosomes. This superior cytotoxicity was further evidenced by DNA fragmentation, increased generation of free radicals (ROS), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and effective inhibition of colony formation. The antimetastatic properties of Exo-HES were confirmed through wound healing and transwell migration assays. Oral pharmacokinetics studies revealed a remarkable increase of approximately 2.5 times in oral bioavailability and half-life of HES when loaded into exosomes. Subsequent in vivo experiments utilizing a B16F10-induced melanoma model in Swiss mice established that Exo-HES exhibited superior anticancer activity compared to HES after oral administration. Importantly, no biochemical, hematological, or histological toxicities were observed in tumor-bearing mice treated with Exo-HES. These findings suggest that exosomes loaded with HES represent a promising nanocarrier strategy to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of hesperidin in melanoma treatment.",

Hypothyroidism is a common clinical disorder characterized by deficiency in THs and adversely affects the development and functions of several organs. This work aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of eltroxin (ELT), a hypothyroidism medication, and hesperidin (HSP), a flavonoid, against testicular and renal toxicity in hypothyroid rats. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups and treated orally for 12 weeks. Group I (control), group II (hypothyroidism) received 20 mg/kg carbimazole (CBZ), group III received CBZ and 0.045 mg/kg ELT, and group IV received CBZ and 200 mg/kg HSP. RESULTS: CBZ administration induced biochemical and histopathological changes in testis and kidney. Co-administration of ELT or HSP significantly (P < 0.05) ameliorated THs, reduced urea and creatinine while raised follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone in serum. Testicular and renal malondialdehyde level as a lipid peroxidation indicator, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased while glutathione content, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-s-transferase activities were significantly (P < 0.05) increased. The histopathological changes were also diminished. Decreased mRNA and protein expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma(PPARγ) in hypothyroid rats were up-regulated after ELT or HSP treatment. CONCLUSIONS: ELT and HSP showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects against CBZ-induced testicular and renal toxicity, and these effects may be promoted via activating Nrf2/HO-1 and PPARγ signaling pathways."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element in animals, but excessive intake can lead to renal toxicity damage. Thus, the exploration of effective natural antagonists to reduce the toxicity caused by Zn has become a major scientific problem. METHODS: Here, we found that hesperidin could effectively alleviate the renal toxicity induced by Zn in pigs by using hematoxylin-eosin staining, transmission electron microscope, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence quantitative PCR, and microfloral DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The results showed that hesperidin could effectively attenuate the pathological injury in kidney, and reduce autophagy and apoptosis induced by Zn, which evidenced by the downregulation of LC3, ATG5, Bak1, Bax, Caspase-3 and upregulation of p62 and Bcl2. Additionally, hesperidin could reverse colon injury and the decrease of ZO-1 protein expression. Interestingly, hesperidin restored the intestinal flora structure disturbed by Zn, and significantly reduced the abundance of Tenericutes (phylum level) and Christensenella (genus level). DISCUSSION: Thus, altered intestinal flora and intestinal barrier function constitute the gut-kidney axis, which is involved in hesperidin alleviating Zn-induced nephrotoxicity. Our study provides theoretical basis and practical significance of hesperidin for the prevention and treatment of Zn-induced nephrotoxicity through gut-kidney axis.",

To surmount these challenges, we employed a spontaneous emulsification method to produce hesperidin nanoparticles. These nanoparticles, averaging 197.2 ± 2.8 nm, exhibited uniform dispersion (polydispersity index: 0.13), a zeta potential (ZP) of -28 mV, encapsulation efficiency of 84.04 ± 1.3%, and demonstrated stable and controlled release across various environments. Assessment of the nanoemulsions stability revealed remarkably high stability levels. Cytotoxicity evaluations (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, neutral red, trypan blue, and lactate dehydrogenase) indicated that cancer cell viability following treatment with hesperidin nanoemulsion was concentration and time-dependent, significantly lower compared to cells treated with free hesperidin. The colony formation assay and cell morphology evaluation further corroborated the heightened efficacy of hesperidin in its nano form compared to the free form. In summary, hesperidin nanoparticles not only exhibited more potent anticancer activity than free hesperidin but also demonstrated high biocompatibility with minimal cytotoxic effects on healthy cells. These findings underscore the potential for further exploration of hesperidin nanoparticles as an adjunctive therapy in prostate cancer therapy.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of the orange coproduct extract (OCE) and the combination of pure hesperidin and oleuropein (HO) on an experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin (BLM) in Wistar rats. Rats were divided into six groups: the control group (G1), the BLM group (G2), three groups (G3, G4, G5) receiving a single dose of BLM combined with OCE extract at 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg, and group 6 (G6) receiving a single dose of BLM combined with HO: both pure major phenolic compounds of OCE (hesperidin at 50 mg/kg) and olive leaves (oleuropein at 2.5 mg/kg). Oxidative stress in lung tissues was investigated using catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) assays and the measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Treatment with OCE and HO normalized the disturbance in oxidative markers' levels and showed a significant reduction in fibrosis score with no renal or hepatic toxic effects. In conclusion, OCE and HO exhibit antifibrotic effects on a rat model of pulmonary fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "In recent years many women have looked for alternative therapies to address menopause. Hesperidin, phytosterols and curcumin are bioactive compounds that can ameliorate some cardiovascular risk factors associated with menopause, although there are no data concerning the effects of their combined supplementation. We used ovariectomized (OVX) rats, a postmenopausal model with oestrogen deficiency, to evaluate whether supplementation with a multi-ingredient (MI) including hesperidin, phytosterols and curcumin for 57 days would display beneficial effects against fat mass accretion and metabolic disturbances associated with menopause. Twenty OVX rats were orally supplemented with either MI (OVX-MI) or vehicle (OVX). Furthermore, 10 OVX rats orally received the vehicle along with subcutaneous injections of 17β-oestradiol biweekly (OVX-E2), whereas 10 rats were sham operated and received oral and injected vehicles (control group; SH). MI supplementation partly counteracted the fat mass accretion observed in OVX animals, which was evidenced by decreased total fat mass, adiposity index, the weight of retroperitoneal, inguinal and mesenteric white adipose tissue (MWAT) depots and MWAT adipocyte hypertrophy. These effects were accompanied by a significant decrease in the circulating levels of leptin and the mRNA levels of the fatty acid uptake-related genes Lpl and Cd36 in MWAT. These results were very similar to those observed in OVX-E2 animals. OVX-MI rats also displayed a higher lean body mass, lean/fat mass ratio, adiponectin-to-leptin ratio and insulin sensitivity than their OVX counterparts. Our findings can pave the way for using this MI formulation as an alternative therapy to manage obesity and to improve the cardiometabolic health of menopausal women.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study evaluated the protective effect of hesperidin on injury induced by gastric ischemia-reperfusion. METHODS: Fifty male Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g) were divided into five groups: control (C), sham (S), ischemia (I), ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and hesperidin + ischemia-reperfusion (Hes + I/R). Hesperidin was injected intraperitoneally at the dose of 100 mg/kg one hour before the experimental stomach ischemia-reperfusion. Celiac artery was ligated. After 45 minutes ischemia and 60 minutes reperfusion period, blood samples were obtained under anesthesia. Then, animals were sacrificed, stomach tissues were excised for biochemical, and histopathological analyses were performed. Malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase activities and total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), protein, total thiol parameters were measured in plasma, and tissue homogenate samples. H + E, periodic acid-Schiff, hypoxia inducible factor, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) for cell proliferation as immunohistochemical parameters were determined. RESULTS: Upon biochemical and histopathological assessment, hesperidin decreased stomach tissue changes in comparison with IR group. Ischemia-reperfusion injury led to a considerably increase in malondialdehyde, protein, and TOS levels (p < 0.001) in stomach tissue. Hesperidin treatment significantly decreased malondialdehyde, protein, and TOS levels (p < 0.001). Hesperidin increased superoxide dismutase, TAS, total thiol and glutathione peroxidase activities in comparison with IR group. Hesperidin reduced damage and also increased TUNEL and PCNA immunoreactivity in stomach tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Hesperidin was able to decrease I/R injury of the stomach tissue due to inhibition of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, duration of antioxidant, and free radical scavenger properties. Consequently, hesperidin can provide a beneficial therapeutic choice for preventing stomach tissue ischemia-reperfusion injury in clinical application.",

      "abstract": "The cardioprotective activity of hesperidin has been well demonstrated in several clinical studies. Also, there is a meta-analysis published on this topic in 2019. However, considering the recently published clinical studies, there is a scope for performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of hesperidin to determine its beneficial effect in alleviating alterations in cardiovascular parameters. In this study, the literature search was performed using online databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar till April 2023 involving randomized controlled studies conducted on hesperidin against various cardiovascular disorders including metabolic disorders in healthy/diseased individuals compared to the placebo/control. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, nine clinical studies involving 2414 subjects were included. The meta-analysis revealed that hesperidin has significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (IV: -0.55 (-0.94 to -0.16) at 95% CI, p = 0.005, I2 = 70%), total cholesterol (TC) (IV: -61 (-0.82 to -0.41) at 95% CI, p < 0.00001, I2 = 69%), and triglycerides (TG) (IV: -0.21 (-0.40 to -0.02) at 95% CI, p = 0.03, I2 = 12%). However, there were no statistically significant changes in the systolic blood pressure (IV: -0.29 (-2.21 to 1.63) at 95% CI, p = 0.77, I2 = 60%), diastolic blood pressure (IV: 0.79 (-0.74 to 2.31) at 95% CI, p = 0.31, I2 = 49%), and high-density lipoprotein (IV: 0.04 (-0.25 to 0.34) at 95% CI, p = 0.78, I2 = 56%) in the hesperidin treatment compared to the placebo/control. In conclusion, the outcomes of this meta-analysis suggest that hesperidin administration could benefit patients with CVD by reducing LDL, TC, and TG. Further high-quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of hesperidin for its benefits in treating cardiovascular conditions.",

      "abstract": "The tight junctions (TJs) and barrier function of the intestinal epithelium are highly sensitive to radiation. However, polyphenols can be used to reverse the effects of radiation. Here, we investigated the effects of hesperidin (hesperetin-7-rhamnoglucoside) on X-ray-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in human epithelial Caco-2 monolayers. To examine whether hesperidin mitigated the effects of X-ray exposure (2 Gy), cell survival was evaluated and intestinal barrier function was assessed by measuring the transepithelial flux, apparent permeability coefficient (Papp), and barrier integrity. Hesperidin improved the survival of Caco-2 cell monolayers and attenuated X-ray exposure-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. For fluorescein transport experiments, transepithelial flux and Papp of fluorescein in control group were significantly elevated by X-ray, but were restored to near control by 10 μM hesperidin pretreatment. Further, X-ray exposure decreased the barrier integrity and TJ interruption by reducing TJ-related proteins occludin and claudin-4, whereas cell monolayers pretreated with hesperidin before X-ray exposure were reinstated to control level. It was concluded that hesperidin treatment before X-ray exposure alleviated X-ray-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction through regulation of TJ-related proteins. These results indicate that hesperidin prevents and mitigates X-ray-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Background Oral carcinoma presents a significant health challenge, prompting the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Elevation of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), has promoted cellular proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and fostered oral cancer progression through complex signaling pathways. Hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside found in citrus fruits, is of keen interest in this study as it has been proven to have multiple health benefits through in vivo and in vitro studies. However, the mechanism behind the anticancer activity of hesperidin in oral carcinoma remains obscure. Aim The study aimed to explore the anticancer potential of hesperidin on human oral cancer cells (KB cells) by modulating pro-inflammatory and apoptotic signaling mechanisms. Methods Cancer cell growth inhibitory activity was assessed using the MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assay. Gene expression analysis was performed using real-time RT-PCR analysis. In addition, in silico docking analysis was conducted to confirm the binding affinity of hesperidin with pro-inflammatory and apoptosis signaling molecules. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and the \"t\" test. Results Utilizing the MTT assay, a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of hesperidin was unveiled, with a remarkable IC50 value indicative of its potent inhibition of cell proliferation. Complementing these findings (p<0.05), qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated hesperidin's regulatory influence on key molecular targets within the KB cell line. Hesperidin treatment resulted in a noteworthy reduction in TNF-α, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1-β), IL-6, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) mRNA expression levels (p<0.05), highlighting its inhibitory role in cell proliferation, migration, and inflammation processes. Simultaneously, hesperidin promoted the expression of BAX mRNA (p<0.05), indicating an enhancement in cell death. Molecular docking simulations further revealed robust binding affinities between hesperidin and target proteins, suggesting its potential to disrupt cellular functions and inflammatory signaling pathways in oral cancer cells. Conclusion The cytotoxic effects on the KB cell line and its anti-inflammatory properties position hesperidin as a compelling candidate for further exploration in the quest for effective oral carcinoma treatments. These findings shed light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying hesperidin's promise as a therapeutic agent against oral carcinoma."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer treatment options are diverse, with tamoxifen commonly used as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen can have adverse systemic effects. Local transdermal therapy offers a potential solution by delivering the drug directly to the breast and minimizing systemic exposure. Hesperidin, a flavonoid, exerts synergistic effects when combined with anticancer agents. This combination therapy may be a more effective approach to breast cancer management. Analytical methods have been developed to quantify 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) and hesperidin separately; however, no method currently exists for their simultaneous quantification in pharmaceutical formulations. This study aimed to develop and validate a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for the simultaneous quantification of 4-HT and hesperidin in liposomal formulations. A Design of Experiments (DoE) approach was employed using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) to optimize the RP-HPLC method. BBD allowed for a reduction in the number of required tests by creating a statistical model to estimate the significance of various factors and interactions. The methanol concentration, flow rate, and injection volume were considered as independent variables for optimization. A mobile phase (90:10 ratio of methanol: 0.1% v/v orthophosphoric acid) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, and an injection volume of 10 μL was selected as optimized chromatographic condition. 4-HT showed a retention time (Rt) of 5.05 min and hesperidin showed an Rt of 7.11 min using an optimized analytical method and was detected at 275 nm. The developed RP-HPLC method was validated according to the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, confirming its accuracy, precision, linearity, selectivity, and robustness. The validated method was then successfully applied to determine the entrapment efficiency and permeation of 4-HT and hesperidin into loaded liposomes. This study fills a gap in the literature by providing a simple and reliable RP-HPLC method for the simultaneous quantification of 4-HT and hesperidin in liposomal formulations."

After a lifespan study to select exposure time and concentrations, flies were co-exposed to MPTP (0.4 mg/g diet), Hesperetin (0.2 and 0.4 mg/g diet), and Hesperidin (0.1 and 0.4 mg/g) for 7 days. In addition to in vivo parameters, we assayed some markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, thiol content, hydrogen peroxide, and nitrate/nitrite levels, mRNA expression of Keap-1 (Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1), /Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2), catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities), and cholinergic (acetyl cholinesterase activity (AChE) and dopaminergic signaling content and the mRNA expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), monoamine oxidase (MAO-like) activity). In addition to increasing the lifespan of flies, we found that both flavonoids counteracted the adverse effects of MPTP on survival, offspring emergence, and climbing ability of flies. Both flavonoids also reduced the oxidative damage on lipids and proteins and reestablished the basal levels of pro-oxidant species and activities of antioxidant enzymes in MPTP-exposed flies. These responses were accompanied by the normalization of the mRNA expression of Keap1/Nrf2 disrupted in flies exposed to MPTP. MPTP exposure also elicited changes in mRNA expression and content of TH as well as in MAO and AChE activity, which were reversed by HST and HSD. By efficiently hindering the oxidative stress in MPTP-exposed flies, our findings support the promising role of Hesperetin and Hesperidin as adjuvant therapy to manage Parkinsonism induced by chemicals such as MPTP.",

      "abstract": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is by far the most common mycotoxin contaminating cereal foods and feeds. Furthermore, cleaning up DON from contaminated cereal items is challenging. Low-dose DON consumption poses a danger to humans and agricultural animals. The benefits of hesperidin (HDN) include liver protection, anti-oxidative stress, nontoxicity, and a broad range of sources. The study used immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy to identify factors associated with mitophagy in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that low-dose DON exposure inhibited mitophagy in the liver tissue of mice. SIRT1 was a crucial regulator of mitophagy. Moreover, DON stimulated the dephosphorylation of SIRT1 and the acetylation-regulated FOXO3 protein, which resulted in the transcriptional inhibition of FOXO3-driven BNIP3 and compromised the stability of the PINK1 protein mediated by BNIP3. Moreover, HDN's effect was comparable to that of a SIRT1 agonist, which led to a significant decrease in the level of mitophagy inhibition caused by low-dose DON exposure. When combined, these findings suggested that HDN might be a useful treatment approach for liver damage brought on by low-dose DON exposure. Above all, this research will offer fresh perspectives on a viable approach that will encourage further research into risk reduction initiatives for low-dose DON exposure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic conjunctivitis is one of the most common eye disorders. Different drugs are used for its treatment. Hesperidin is an active substance isolated from Citrus sinensis L. (Rutaceae) fruit peels, with known anti-inflammatory activity but low solubility. It was complexed with cyclodextrin and encapsulated in situ gel to extend its duration in the eye. RESULTS: The optimized formulation comprised 1% hesperidin, 1.5% hydroxyethyl cellulose, and 16% poloxamer 407. The viscosity at 25 °C was 492 ± 82 cP, and at 35 °C it was 8875 ± 248 cP, the pH was 7.01 ± 0.03, gelation temperature was 34 ± 1.3 °C, and gelation time was 33 ± 1.2 s. There was a 66% in vitro release in the initial 2 h, with a burst effect. A lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibition test determined that hesperidin was active at high doses on leukotyrens seen in the body in allergic diseases. In cell-culture studies, the hesperidin cyclodextrin complex loaded in situ gel, BRN9-CD (poloxamer 16%, hydroxy ethyl cellulose (HEC) 1.5%), enhanced cell viability in comparison with the hesperidin solution. It was determined that BRN9-CD did not cause any irritation in the ocular tissues in the Draize test. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of the in situ gel formulation of hesperidin in terms of ease of application and residence time on the ocular surface. Due to its notable LOX inhibition activity and positive outcomes in the in vivo Draize test, it appears promising for incorporation into pharmaceutical formulations. © 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline antibiotic, is a powerful chemotherapeutic agent effective against multiple types of cancer, particularly lung, breast, bladder and hematologic neoplasia (lymphomas and leukemia). However, its therapeutic usage is restricted by its known cardiotoxicity, which is associated with the production of oxidative stress. Enhancing antioxidant capacity represents a promising approach to mitigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Hesperidin (HES), a citrus bioflavonoid, possesses several pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. AIM: This study was designed to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of DOX and assess the possible cardioprotective role of HES. METHODS: Groups of Wistar rats were either treated with DOX (4 mg/kg. bw., once a week for five consecutive weeks, intraperitoneally) or received co-treatment with HES (100 mg/kg. bw./day in distilled water, 5 days in a week for five consecutive weeks, administered orally). Heart and blood samples were obtained for histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical assessments. RESULTS: DOX administration resulted in severe cardiotoxicity, as evidenced by significant elevations in cardiac biomarkers, including Troponin I (CTnI), Creatine kinase (CK-Total), Creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). DOX also elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interferon γ (IFN-γ), Interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Furthermore, DOX-induced oxidative stress and substantially reduced the levels of antioxidant enzymes, including Glutathione peroxidase (GPX), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), and Catalase (CAT). Histopathologically, DOX caused severe Zenker's necrosis, cardiomyocyte disarray, sarcoplasmic vacuolizations, cardiomyocyte congestion, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Immunohistochemically, DOX exhibited extensive apoptosis, as indicated by strong positive immuno-localization against anti-caspase-3 antibody. In contrast, co-treatment with HES protected cardiac tissues against cardiotoxicity of DOX, as indicated by the amelioration of histological abnormalities and the normalization of biochemical values. CONCLUSION: We can conclude that DOX induces severe cardiotoxicity characterized by oxidative stress, inflammation, pathological alterations, and apoptosis. Co-treatment with HES demonstrates significant cardioprotective effects by virtue of its potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytoprotective, and antiapoptotic characteristics.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Feline idiopathic cystitis is a common, chronic-relapsing disorder of the lower urinary tract. In addition to environmental modification/enrichment, long-term and safe treatment targeting specific pathophysiological changes may be of help. In this context, effective dietary interventions hold clinical promise. Palmitoyl-glucosamine (PGA) and hesperidin (HSP) are safe and authorized feed ingredients for animal nutrition under European regulations. METHODS: The current study aimed to investigate whether a 3:1 mixture of micronized PGA and HSP could represent a novel mechanism-oriented approach to chronic cystitis management. A newly validated rat model of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced chronic cystitis was used (40 mg/kg, three intraperitoneal injections every 3rd day). Animals were randomized to orally receive either vehicle or PGA-HSP at a low (72 + 24 mg/kg) or high (doubled) dose for 13 days, starting 3 days before the chronic CYP protocol, with mesna (2-mercaptoethane-sulfonate) being used as a reference drug. RESULTS: Higher PGA-HSP dose was effective at relieving chronic visceral pain, as measured by mechanical allodynia test (von Frey test). The severity of cystitis was also significantly improved, as shown by the reduced sonographic thickening of the bladder wall, as well as the decrease in edema, bleeding and bladder to body weight ratio compared to the vehicle treated group. A significant decrease of MPO activity, MDA level and fibrosis at Masson's trichrome staining was also observed in animals administered PGA-HSP in comparison to vehicle treated ones. The CYP-induced increase in bladder mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was also significantly counteracted by the study mixture. Moreover, CYP-induced bladder mast cell accumulation and releasability were significantly decreased by PGA-HSP (even at the low dose), as determined by metachromatic staining, chymase and tryptase immunostaining as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for histamine and 5-hydoxytriptamine. DISCUSSION: PGA-HSP is able to block CYP-induced decrease of tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin, thus preserving the urothelial bladder function. Finally, neuroinflammatory changes were investigated, showing that dietary supplementation with PGA-HSP prevented the activation of neurons and non-neuronal cells (i.e., microglia, astrocytes and mast cells) at the spinal level, and counteracted CYP-induced increase of spinal mRNA encoding for pro-inflammatory cytokines. Altogether, the present findings confirm the uroprotective and pain-relieving effect of PGA-HSP and pave the way to potential and relevant clinical applications of the study supplement in feline idiopathic cystitis."

      "abstract": "Gastric ulcers are worrying, and their worsening conditions may result in bleeding in the internal lining of the stomach. The problem is annoying, and both patients and professionals are still not satisfied with the available treatment options. Hesperidin, a flavonoid molecule with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, can work like witchcraft to repair gastric ulcers and preserve the stomach lining. Here, we employed a strategy that involved covering the surface of the nano-lipid carriers (NLCs) with sericin before encasing the hesperidin within (Se-He-NLC). Sericin, a biodegradable polymer increases the muco-adhesion with stomach lining and deployment of hesperidin in controlled manner. Se-He-NLCs were physico-chemically characterized for drug loading, encapsulation, particle size, morphology, drug release, chemical stability, and chemical bonding. The nanocarriers showed first order drug release in a controlled manner. Se-He-NLCs showed better in vitro permeation and ex vivo mucoadhesion, thereby by promoting the in vivo bioavailability. Se-He-NLCs also promoted the reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) levels by 2.24- and 1.61-folds, respectively in the stomach lining, and also the regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities parallel to the control group. In addition, tissues lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were reduced significantly with Se-He-NLCs administration. Se-He-NLC therapy of stomach ulcers in vivo demonstrated better binding ratio and ulcer healing potential. This approach reveals huge capacity for delivering therapies to treat gastric ulcers based on the clinical significance of sericin coated hesperidin nanocarriers in gastric ulcer treatment.",

The main objective of this research is to ascertain their potential as therapeutic options for managing diabetes and its complications. The present study utilized a systematic review methodology and comprehensively explored relevant literature from databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, from inception until July 2023. The review summarized the outcomes related to the molecular, cellular, and metabolic effects of hesperidin and hesperetin in diabetes and its complications. Hesperetin exhibits a potential treatment for preventing diabetes and its associated complications through modulation of inflammatory cytokine release and expression via the pathway of signaling through Toll-like receptor/Myeloid differentiation factor 88/Nuclear factor-kappa B. Hesperidin shows promise as a biomolecule for treating diabetic neuropathy, primarily through activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), as an antioxidant-response element signaling, leading to neuroprotective effects. Both compounds demonstrated the ability to normalize blood glucose levels and reduce serum and liver lipid levels, making them potential candidates for managing hypoglycemia and hypolipidemia in diabetes. Hesperidin also showed potential benefits against diabetic nephropathy by suppressing transforming growth factor-β1-integrin-linked kinase-Akt signaling and enhancing renal function. Furthermore, hesperidin's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-depressant effects in diabetic conditions expanded its potential therapeutic applications. This systematic review provides substantial evidence supporting the consideration of hesperidin and hesperetin for diabetes and its complications. It offers exciting possibilities for developing novel, cost-effective treatment options to enhance diabetes management and patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer ranks as the second leading most significant of mortality for women. Studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of natural compounds in cancer treatment and prevention, either in isolation or in conjunction with chemotherapy. In order to improve Tamoxifen's therapeutic efficacy in in-vivo studies, our research sought to determine the effects of hesperidin, piperine, and bee venom as natural compounds, as well as their combination effect with or without Tamoxifen. First, 132 female albino rats were equally divided into six groups and five subgroups, and breast cancer was induced in the selected groups by xenografting of MCF7 cells. Second, the effect of single and best ratio combinations treatment from previous in vitro studies were selected. Next, tumorous mammary glands were collected for apoptotic and antiapoptotic biomarkers and cell cycle analysis. Single or combined natural products with or without Tamoxifen revealed a significant up-regulation in apoptotic genes Bax and Casp3 and a downregulation of antiapoptotic and angiogenesis genes Bcl-2 and VEGF genes. We found that cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase was exclusively caused by Tamoxifen and/ or hesperidin. However, the cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase is a result of the combination of piperine and bee venom, with or without Tamoxifen by using the flow cytometric technique. Our research concludes that bee venom, hesperidin, and piperine can synergistically enhance to increase Tamoxifen's efficiency in the management of breast cancer.",

The current study aims to investigate the effect of hesperidin and Quinolinic acid (QA) on ROS and antioxidant levels, and cell viability of OLN-93 cells. METHODS: OLN-93 cell lines were treated with hesperidin and QA. OLN-93 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under controlled conditions. Cell viability assays were performed using resazurin to assess the toxicity of hesperidin and QA. Additionally, ROS levels were measured using DCFDA, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined to evaluate oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and cell viability were assessed by trypan blue staining after exposure to hesperidin and QA. RESULTS: The results of the current study showed that co-administration of 8 mM QA with 50, 100, and 200 μM hesperidin significantly reduced both ROS and MDA levels, demonstrating a substantial attenuation in comparison to the elevated ROS and MDA levels induced by 8 mM QA (p-value < 0.01). Furthermore, 8 mM QA + 50, 100, and 200 μM hesperidin significantly increased SOD levels compared with QA alone (p-value < 0.01). In addition, treatment of OLN cells with 8 mM QA + 50, 100, and 200 μM hesperidin led to higher cell viability compared to QA alone (p value <0.0001). CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated the antioxidant effect of hesperidin on OLN-93 cells suggesting new insights into the clinical application of hesperidin as an effective treatment for patients with MS.

The current study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of hesperidin (HSP) in ameliorating CPF-induced neurotoxicity in rats. In the study, rats were treated with HSP (orally, 50 and 100 mg/kg) 30 min after giving CPF (orally, 6.75 mg/kg) for 28 consecutive days. Molecular, biochemical, and histological methods were used to investigate cholinergic enzymes, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the brain tissue. CPF intoxication resulted in inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes, reduced antioxidant status [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione (GSH)], and elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and carbonic anhydrase (CA) activities. CPF increased histopathological changes and immunohistochemical expressions of 8-OHdG in brain tissue. CPF also increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) while decreased levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α). Furthermore, CPF increased mRNA transcript levels of caspase-3, Bax, PARP-1, and VEGF, which are associated with apoptosis and endothelial damage in rat brain tissues. HSP treatment was found to protect brain tissue by reducing CPF-induced neurotoxicity. Overall, this study supports that HSP can be used to reduce CPF-induced neurotoxicity.",

The aim of the present study was, therefore, to determine the effects of hesperidin on depression, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and serum cortisol levels in post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients. Toward this goal, 73 post-CABG patients with depression symptoms were enrolled. The participants were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 200 mg/day hesperidin (n = 38) or placebo (n = 35) for 12 weeks. Depressive symptoms, serum BDNF, and cortisol levels were then assessed at the baseline and after intervention. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was also used to determine the severity of depression. Sixty-six patients completed the trial. Hesperidin decreased depression severity after 12 weeks, as compared to placebo (p = .004), but serum BDNF and cortisol were not statistically significantly different in the two groups after the intervention. Subgroup analyses also showed that, while in the patients with mild depression, the score of BDI-II was significantly different in the hesperidin and placebo groups after intervention; there was no difference in the severity of depression between the two groups in patients with moderate-to-severe depression. To conclude, a dose of 200 mg/day hesperidin may reduce depressive symptoms after 12 weeks in post-CABG patients with mild depression."

Some studies have reported that hesperidin can reduce hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia by inhibiting inflammatory pathways. In the current study, our purpose was to evaluate whether it can influence the primary parameters in NAFLD and improve the treatment effectiveness for future trials. Various studies have found that hesperidin involves multiple signaling pathways such as cell proliferation, lipid and glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which can potentially affect NAFLD development and prognosis. Recent findings indicate that hesperidin also regulates key enzymes and may affect the severity of liver fibrosis. Hesperidin inhibits reactive oxygen species production that potentially interferes with the activation of transcription factors like nuclear factor-κB. Appropriate adherence to hesperidin may be a promising approach to modulate inflammatory pathways, metabolic indices, hepatic steatosis, and liver injury."

The normal control group was represented by Group 1. Group 2 rats were those that received a dose of 15 Gray (Gy) of radiotherapy. The rats assigned to Group 3 received only Naringenin, whereas those assigned to Group 4 received only quercetine, and those assigned to Group 5 received only hesperidin. Rats in Group 6, 7 and 8 were received naringenin, quarcetin and hesperidin at a dose of 50 mg/kg daily for one week prior to radiotheraphy exposition. After radiotheraphy and phenolic compounds rats were sacrificed and some metabolic enzyme (aldose reductase (AR), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), paraoxonase-1 (PON1), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)) activity was determined in eye and brain tissues. It was found that phenolic compounds have protective effect against radiation-induced damage because of their anti-diabetic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, hesperidin was found to be superior to quercetin and naringenin in terms of enzyme activity efficacy. Furthermore, hesperidin exhibited favorable binding affinity for BChE in silico compared to other enzymes.",

      "abstract": "Reducing fat deposits in hepatocytes is a direct treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the fatty acid metabolic processes mediated by fatty acid β-oxidation are important for the prevention of NAFLD. In this study, we established high-fat-diet models in vitro and in vivo to investigate the mechanism by which hesperidin (HDN) prevents NAFLD by modulating fatty acid β oxidation. Based on LC-MS screening of differential metabolites, many metabolites involved in phospholipid and lipid metabolism were found to be significantly altered and closely associated with fatty acid β-oxidation. The results from COIP experiments indicated that HDN increased the deacetylation of PGC1α by SIRT1. In addition, the results of CETSA and molecular docking experiments suggest that HDN targeting of SIRT1 plays an important role in their stable binding. Meanwhile, it was found that HDN reduced fatty acid uptake and synthesis and promoted the expression of SIRT1/PGC1α and fatty acid β-oxidation, and the latter process was inhibited after transfection to knockdown SIRT1. The results suggest that HDN improves NAFLD by promoting fatty acid β-oxidation through activating SIRT1/PGC1α. Thus, the findings indicate that HDN may be a potential drug for the treatment of NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Malathion (MAL), a pesticide used for decades, is a highly toxic substance. Several studies have documented the negative effects of such agents on reproductive organ physiology, but the precise mechanism of action in the induction of ovarian dysfunction remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to examine the effects of the antioxidant hesperidin (HES) on ovarian damage and toxicity caused by malathion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experiment, forty adult female bulb/c mice weighing 27-30 g were categorized into four groups, namely hesperidin (20 mg/kg, i.p.), malathion (3 mg/kg, i.p.), malathion + hesperidin, and control groups. Following a period of 35 consecutive days of treatment, mice were euthanized, and their ovarian tissues were gathered for the purposes of histopathological analysis by H&E staining, immunohistochemical assessment via proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) immunostaining, and biochemical evaluation via measuring the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). In addition, serum samples were collected from the blood of mice to perform hormonal analyses, especially 17β-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that MAL exposure resulted in the development of abnormalities in the architecture and structure of ovaries. Also, the treatment of mice with MAL led to declined follicular counts at all three stages, namely, primary, secondary, and tertiary, reduced serum levels of sex hormones, decreased immunoreactivity of FSHR and PCNA, and diminished activity of CAT and SOD enzymes. In contrast, it caused an increase in MDA, IL-1β, and TNF-α, as well as the count of atretic follicles. Nonetheless, it was observed that HES exhibited the ability to ameliorate the deleterious impacts of malathion across all the aforementioned parameters. CONCLUSION: Treatment with HES via upregulating the protein expression of PCNA and FSHR and activating antioxidant defense was able to ameliorate the adverse effects of MAL on ovarian tissues."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ensuring colon homeostasis is of significant influence on colon cancer and delicate balance is maintained by a healthy human gut microbiota. Probiotics can modulate the diversity of the gut microbiome and prevent colon cancer. Metabolites/byproducts generated by microbial metabolism significantly impact the healthy colonic environment. Hesperidin is a polyphenolic plant compound well known for its anticancer properties. However, low bioavailability of hesperidin after digestion impedes its effectiveness. CYP2W1 is a newly discovered oncofetal gene with an unknown function. CYP2W1 gene expression peaks during embryonic development and is suddenly silenced immediately after birth. Only in the case of some types of cancer, particularly colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas, this gene is reactivated and its expression is correlated with the severity of the disease. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hesperidin-treated Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) cell-free supernatants on CaCo2 colon cancer cell viability and CYP2W1 gene expression. METHODS: Alamar Blue cell viability assay was used to investigate the cytotoxic effect of cell-free supernatant of LGG grown in the presence of hesperidin on CaCo2 cells. To observe the effect of cell-free supernatants of LGG on the expression of CYP2W1 gene, qRT-PCR was performed. RESULTS: Five times diluted hesperidin treated cell-free supernatant (CFS) concentration considerably reduced CaCo2 colon cancer cell viability. Furthermore, CYP2W1 gene expression was similarly reduced following CFS treatments and nearly silenced under probiotic bacteria CFS treatment. CONCLUSION: The CYP2W1 gene expression was strongly reduced by cell-free supernatants derived from LGG culture, with or without hesperidin. This suggests that the suppression may be due to bacterial byproducts rather than hesperidin. Therefore, the CYP2W1 gene in the case of deregulation of these metabolites may cause CYP2W1-related colon cancer cell proliferation.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, we evaluated the neuroprotective potential of Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone (HMC) against the neurotoxicity induced by Aβ(25-35) peptide. HMC demonstrated higher free-radical scavenging activity than Hesperidin in initial cell-free studies. Investigations using the fluorescent dye thioflavin T with Aβ(25-35) peptide showed that HMC has the ability to combat extracellular amyloid aggregation by possessing anti-aggregation property against oligomers and by disaggregating mature fibrils. Also, the results of the molecular simulation studies show that HMC ameliorated oligomer formation. Further, the anti-Alzheimer's property of HMC was investigated in in vitro cell conditions by pre-treating the neuro 2a (N2a) cells with HMC before inducing Aβ(25-35) toxicity. The findings demonstrate that HMC increased cell viability, reduced oxidative stress, prevented macromolecular damage, allayed mitochondrial dysfunction, and exhibited anticholinesterase activity. HMC also reduced Aβ induced neuronal cell death by modulating caspase-3 activity, Bax expression and Bcl2 overexpression, demonstrating that HMC pre-treatment reduced mitochondrial damage and intrinsic apoptosis induced by Aβ(25-35).In silico evaluation against potential AD targets reveal that HMC could be a potent inhibitor of BACE-1, inhibiting the formation of toxic Aβ peptides. Overall, the findings imply that the neuroprotective efficacy of HMC has high prospects for addressing a variety of pathogenic consequences caused by amyloid beta in AD situations and alleviating cognitive impairments.",

      "abstract": "The α-glucosidase inhibitor is of interest to researchers due to its association with type-II diabetes treatment by suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia. Hesperidin is a major flavonoid in orange fruit with diverse biological properties. This paper evaluates the effects of hesperidin on α-glucosidase through inhibitory kinetics, fluorescence quenching, and molecular docking methods for the first time. The inhibition kinetic analysis shows that hesperidin reversibly inhibited the α-glucosidase activity with an IC50 value of 18.52 μM and the inhibition was performed in an uncompetitive type. The fluorescence quenching studies indicate that the intrinsic fluorescence of α-glucosidase was quenched via a static quenching process and only one binding site was present between the hesperidin and α-glucosidase. The interaction between them was spontaneous and mainly driven by hydrogen bonds, as well as hydrophobic forces. Furthermore, the molecular docking results suggest that hesperidin might bond to the entrance or outlet part of the active site of α-glucosidase through a network of five hydrogen bonds formed between hesperidin and the four amino acid residues (Trp709, Arg422, Asn424, and Arg467) of α-glucosidase and the hydrophobic effects. These results provide new insight into the inhibitory mechanisms of hesperidin on α-glucosidase, supporting the potential application of a hesperidin-rich orange product as a hypoglycemic functional food."

Additionally, the article explores the newly developing field of nanocarrier-based systems as a prospective means of boosting the therapeutic efficiency of hesperidin in the treatment of diabetes. This is because there are difficulties connected with the efficient delivery of hesperidin. These cutting-edge platforms show enormous potential for changing diabetes therapy by utilizing the benefits of nanocarriers, such as enhanced solubility, stability, and targeted delivery.

      "abstract": "Excessive acetaminophen (APAP) is the main cause of drug-induced acute liver failure, and the pathogenesis has not been elucidated and there is a lack of effective drugs. Hesperidin (Hes), a rich flavanone in citrus peel with excellent biological activities, is a potential agent for treatment liver injury. Due to poor water solubility of Hes, this study prepared mixed micelles using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP K17) and poloxamer 188, and encapsulated Hes (Hes-MMs). The results showed that Hes-MMs exhibited a uniform spherical shape with a particle size of 66.80 ± 0.83 nm, and Hes-MMs significantly improved the dispersibility, antioxidant activity, and cellular uptake of Hes. In vitro results showed that Hes-MMs protected the proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells induced by APAP, inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) induced by APAP. Furthermore, Hes-MMs exerted liver protective effects by inhibiting APAP induced mtDNA release and activating the cGAS-STING pathway. In vivo results demonstrated that Hes-MMs showed protective and therapeutic effects on APAP induced liver injury, and their mechanisms were related to the mtDNA-cGAS-STING signaling pathway. In summary, our study demonstrated that the mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway was involved in APAP induced acute liver injury, and Hes-MMs might be a potential therapeutic agent for treating APAP induced acute liver injury.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorders worldwide. Its pathologic features include massive neuroinflammation with abnormal deposition of β-amyloid peptide in the cerebral tissues leading to degeneration of the brain neurons. Adverse effects associated with the traditional drugs used for the treatment of this pathological condition have directed the research efforts towards searching for alternative effective agents with minimal adverse effects. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential ameliorative effects of dapagliflozin and/or hesperidin on Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in rats. In a rodent model of AD, the effect of dapagliflozin with or without hesperidin on the biochemical parameters and the behavioral tests as well as the histopathological parameters was determined. Each of dapagliflozin and hesperidin restored the behavioral tests to the reference values, augmented the antioxidant defense mechanisms, ameliorated the neuronal inflammatory responses, combatted the changes in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)/High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein signaling and receptors of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) levels, and restored the balance between the apoptotic signals and autophagy in the hippocampal tissues. Additionally, both agents exhibited an outstanding ability to combat LPS-induced perturbations in the histopathological and electron microscopic image of the brain tissues. These favorable effects were significantly encountered in the group treated with dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination when compared versus animals treated with either dapagliflozin or hesperidin. In conclusion, inhibition of the hippocampal HMGB1/TLR4/RAGE signaling, the pro-inflammatory axis, and apoptosis alongside augmentation of the antioxidant defenses and autophagy can be regarded as beneficial effects by which dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination may combat LPS-triggered AD."

The association between impaired male reproductive function and Pb-induced oxidative stress (OS) has been demonstrated, with consequent testicular antioxidant deficiency. The current study investigated the protective role of the natural antioxidant hesperidin (HSD) against lead-acetate (PbAc)-induced testicular toxicity. Male Wistar rats (n = 40) were randomly divided into four experimental groups: Group I (negative control) received 2.0 mL/kg BW 0.9% saline; Group II received 100 mg/kg BW PbAc; Group III received 100 mg/kg BW HSD; and Group IV received HSD two hours before PbAc using the abovementioned doses. The treatments were administered daily for 30 consecutive days. The results showed that HSD treatment significantly restored PbAc-induced decrease in body, epididymal, and testicular weights as well as in semen parameters, reproductive hormones, and testicular markers of OS. Reduced MDA levels and improved testicular histopathological findings were also observed. Collectively, this study sheds light on the preventive role of HSD against PbAc-induced testicular injury, which is mediated via the suppression of OS and the modulation of reproductive hormones as well as the plausibility of HSD being used as a supplementary therapeutic option for recovery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical use of sildenafil citrate (Viagra), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction, is limited because of its many side effects on tissues. In this context, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of hesperidin, a citrus flavonoid, on hepatic and testicular damage induced by a high dose of sildenafil citrate in male rats. Rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group was used as the control group. The second group was orally administered sildenafil citrate at a high dose of 75 mg/kg thrice a week. In the third group, hesperidin was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The fourth group was administered 75 mg/kg sildenafil citrate three times a week with 50 mg/kg hesperidin daily. The experiment lasted for 28 days. RESULTS: In the sildenafil-treated groups, blood indices were altered, liver function tests were deranged, and serum testosterone levels were reduced. In the liver and testicular tissue, sildenafil citrate treatment resulted in significant reductions in catalase and total antioxidant capacity; as well as increased malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species, and nitrous oxide levels. In addition, sildenafil citrate treatment caused abnormal histopathological patterns in both the liver and the testes. Liver vascular endothelial growth factor and testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene expression were upregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Hesperidin attenuated the harmful effects of intensive sildenafil citrate treatment on liver and testicular functions, alleviated oxidative stress and normalized blood indices. Therefore, hesperidin could be protective against sildenafil citrate-induced oxidative damage that may develop over the long term."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Hesperidin (HES) is a well-known citrus bioflavonoid phyto-nutraceutical agent with polypharmacological properties. After 2019, HES was widely used for prophylaxis and COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, it is commonly prescribed for treating varicose veins and other diseases in routine clinical practice. Pharmaceutical impurities and degradation products (DP) impact the drug's quality and safety and thus its effectiveness. Therefore, forced degradation studies help study drug stability, degradation mechanisms, and their DPs. This study was performed because stress stability studies using detailed structural characterization of hesperidin are currently unavailable in the literature. METHODS: In the HES enrichment method crude HES was converted to its pure form (98% purity) using column chromatography and then subjected to forced degradation under acid, base, and neutral hydrolyses followed by oxidative, reductive, photolytic, and thermal stress testing (International Conference on Harmonization guidelines). The stability-indicating analytical method (SIAM) was developed to determine DPs using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (C18 column with methanol and 0.1% v/v acetic acid in deionized water [70:30, v/v] at 284 nm). Further, structural characterization of DPs was performed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In addition, in silico toxicity predictions were performed using pKCSM and DataWarior freeware. RESULTS: HES was found to be susceptible to acidic and basic hydrolytic conditions and yielded three DPs in each, which were detected using designed SIAM. Of six DPs, three were pseudo-DPs (short lived), and the remaining were characterized using LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The tentative mechanism of the formation of proposed DPs was explained. The proposed DPs were found inactive from in silico toxicity predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Hesperidin was labile under acidic and basic stress conditions. The potential DPs were characterized using LC-ESI-MS/MS and NMR spectral techniques. The proposed mechanism of formation was hypothesized. In addition, to identify and characterize the DPs, a SIAM, which has broad biomedical applications, was successfully developed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hesperidin, a flavanone commonly found in citrus fruits and herbal formulations, has emerged as a potential new therapeutic agent for modulating several diseases. Since pre-eclampsia is a growing public health threat, it may negatively impact the economy and increase the disease burden of South Africa. Phytocompounds are easily accessible, demonstrate minimal side effects, and may confer novel medicinal options as a treatment and preventive preference. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the physiological, biochemical, and hematological outcomes of hesperidin in an arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced rodent model of pre-eclampsia. METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically implanted with mini-osmotic pumps to deliver AVP (200 ng/h) subcutaneously. Animals were treated with hesperidin at 200 mg/kg.b.w via oral gavage for 14 days. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured on GD 7, 14, and 18 using a non-invasive tail-cuff method and were euthanized on GD 21. RESULTS: The findings showed that hesperidin administration significantly decreased blood pressure (P < 0.05) and urinary protein levels in pregnant rats (P < 0.001). Placental and individual pup weight also increased significantly in the pregnant hesperidin-treated groups compared to AVP untreated groups (P < 0.001). Biochemical and hematological markers such as white blood cell count and lymphocyte levels differed significantly (P < 0.05) in AVP groups treated with and without hesperidin. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hesperidin is an antihypertensive agent with modes of action associated with its diuretic and blood pressure lowering effects and reduction of proteinuria in AVP-induced pre-eclamptic rats.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Endometriosis (EM) is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus. This study aimed to examine the effects of quince gel and hesperidin treatment on uterine tissue in an experimental endometriosis model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two rats were categorized into four groups as sham, EM, EM+quince gel (QG), and EM+QG+Hesperidin (HES). The endometriosis (EM) model was induced with surgical intervention. Estradiol benzoate (EB) was used to induce endometrial hyperplasia. In the EM group, EB was given to rats for 7 days. The EM+QG group received 2 cc QG for 21 days. HES treatment was given for 21 days after EM induction. At the end of the experiment, blood was taken from the animals and the serum total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) values were studied. Uterine tissues were dissected and processed for histological paraffin embedding. Tissues were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde solution and processed for ultrastructural analysis. RESULTS: After EM, QG and HES treatment significantly increased the TAS and decreased the TOS value. EM caused epithelial and glandular degeneration, thinning of the basal membranes, and vascular dilatation with increased fibrosis and edema. QG+HES restored the pathology and showed protective effects in uterine tissues. Caspase-3 expression was increased in the epithelium, glands, and muscle layers of the EM group. In EM+QG+HES, hesperidin protected cell survival and decreased Caspase-3 expression in uterine tissues. TNF-α expression was intense in inflammatory cells and the muscle layer in the EM group. HES reduced inflammation by decreasing the TNF-α expression. MAPK expression was increased after EM induction in epithelial, glandular, and inflammatory cells in the EM group. After HES treatment, MAPK expression was mainly negative in cells of uterine tissue in the EM+QG+HES group. Ultrastructurally, in the EM group, organelles were disrupted and dilated and degenerated after EM induction. QG and HES treatment improved cellular organelles. CONCLUSION: Local vaginal applications can be an alternative treatment method in the endometriosis model via QG+HES treatment promoting cell proliferation and angiogenesis and preventing cell death.",

      "abstract": "Neurogenesis is a process of generating neural stem cells (NSCs) as functional neurons can be decreased after chemotherapy treatments. Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate antagonist that is used for cancer treatment but has negative effects, including oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis and cognitive impairments. Hesperidin (Hsd), a flavonoid found in citrus fruits, has antioxidant and neuroprotection properties. This study investigated whether Hsd could attenuate impairments of hippocampal neural stem cells related to apoptosis induced by MTX. Spraque-Dawley rats (n = 24) were divided into 4 groups: (1) Vehicle group received propylene glycol (21 days) and 0.9% normal saline (day 8 and 15), (2) Hsd group received 100 mg/kg (21 days), (3) MTX group received 75 mg/kg (days 8 and 15) and (4) MTX+Hsd group received MTX, 75 mg/kg (day 8 and 15) and Hsd 100 mg/kg (21 days). Our results showed that MTX decreased hippocampal neural stem cells including SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) and nestin. MTX diminished vascular related (VR) Ki-67 positive cells in the hippocampus but not non-vascular related (NVR) Ki-67. Additionally, MTX reduced SOX2, nestin, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and B-cell lymphoma-2 family of proteins (Bcl-2), whereas Bax and caspase-3 were enhanced in the hippocampal tissues. Interestingly, co-treatment with Hsd and MTX revealed upregulation of SOX2, nestin and VR Ki-67 positive cells as well as elevated SOX2, nestin, PSD-95 and Bcl-2 proteins. Moreover, receiving both Hsd and MTX significantly suppressed increased Bax and caspase-3. These results confirm that Hsd can ameliorate MTX-induced impairments of hippocampal NSC proliferation and neuronal apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Considering the unfavourable response of breast cancer (BC) to treatment, we assessed the therapeutic potential hesperidin in mice bearing 4T1 BC tumours. Anti-tumour effects were assessed by measuring pathologic complete response (pCR), survival analysis, immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin, VEGF, MMP9, MMP2 and Ki-67, serum measurement of IFNγ and IL-4, and gene expression analysis of CD105, VEGFa, VEGFR2 and COX2. Survival of tumour-bearing mice was the highest in mice receiving a combination of hesperidin and doxorubicin (Dox) (80%) compared to the normal saline (43%), hesperidin 5 (54%), 10 (55.5%), 10 (60.5%) and 40 (66%) mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg Dox-treated (73%) groups (p < 0.0001 for all). Compared to the normal saline group, there was a significant elevation in IFNγ level in the animals receiving 20 (p = 0.0026) and 40 (p < 0.001) mg/kg hesperidin, 10 mg/kg Dox (p < 0.001), and combined hesperidin (20 mg/kg) and Dox (10 mg/kg) (p < 0.001). A significant reduction in the gene expression of CD 105 (p = 0.0106), VEGFa (p < 0.0001), VEGFR2 (p < 0.0001), and Cox2 (p = 0.034) and a significant higher pCR score (p = 0.006) were noticed in mice treated with 10 mg/kg Dox + 20 mg/kg hesperidin compared to those treated with 10 mg/kg Dox alone. Immunohistochemical staining showed significant reductions in Ki-67 (p < 0.001) and VEGF (p < 0.001) and a significant elevation in E-cadherin (p = 0.005) in the 10 mg/kg Dox + 20 mg/kg treatment group than in 10 mg/kg Dox alone group. Hesperidin can be considered as a potentially suitable anti-cancer agent for BC that can synergize with other chemotherapeutics.",

      "abstract": "Faced with a globally aging society, the maintenance of health and quality of life in older people is very important. The age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, known as sarcopenia, severely reduces quality of life and increases the risks of various diseases. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of hesperidin (HES) on inflammaging, with the intention of evaluating its potential use as a treatment for sarcopenia. We studied 22-26-month-old mice, corresponding to humans aged ≥70 years, with aging-related sarcopenia, and young mice aged 3-6 months. The daily administration of HES for 8 weeks resulted in greater muscle mass and strength and increased the fiber size of the old mice. HES also restored the immune homeostasis that had been disrupted by aging, such as the imbalance in M1/M2 macrophage ratio. In addition, we found that HES ameliorated the sarcopenia by regulating AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin/forkhead box 3a signaling through an increase in insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 expression in the old mice. Therefore, HES represents a promising candidate inhibitor of sarcopenia in older people, and its effects are achieved through the maintenance of immune homeostasis."
