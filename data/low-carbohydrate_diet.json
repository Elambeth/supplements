      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Acquired limb loss can be a traumatic experience that is often accompanied by chronic pain (ie, phantom limb pain (PLP) and/or residual limb pain (RLP)) and can cause a reduction in emotional well-being and overall quality of life. Although, there are available treatments for PLP/RLP, few provide long-term relief. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of diet on reported pain and quality of life measures among adults with acquired limb loss. METHODS: Seven adults with acquired limb loss (M = 50.57, SD ± 13.63 years of age) were enrolled in a 6-week low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) intervention. Baseline, 3-week, and 6-week measures of pain sensitivity (BPI, NPQ), cognitive flexibility (CFS), depression (CES-D, PROMIS-57), anxiety (PROMIS-57), pain resilience (PRS), and overall quality of life (SF-36) were obtained using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: On average, all participants had appreciable levels of depression (M = 18.71, SD ± 6.16) and anxiety (M = 19.71, SD ± 5.94), yet relatively high levels of pain resilience (M = 44.42, SD ± 6.70) at baseline. After 6 weeks, participants showed improvements in self-reported measures of pain severity, emotional well-being, and other psychosocial measures of interest, including depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that an LCD might have an influence on multiple chronic pain-related factors among adults living with an amputation. Furthermore, adults living with chronic PLP/RLP may report high resilience, although high levels of depression and anxiety are also reported."

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) believed to be driven by autoimmune mechanisms. Genetic and environmental factors are implicated in MS development, and among the latter, diets and nutrients are emerging as potential critical contributors. However, a comprehensive understanding of their impacts and the underlying mechanisms involved is lacking. Harnessing state-of-the-art nutritional geometry analytical methods, it is first revealed that globally, increased carbohydrate supply is associated with increased MS disease burden, while fat supply has an opposite effect. Furthermore, in a MS mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is found that an isocaloric diet high in carbohydrate aggravated EAE, while a diet enriched in fat (HF) is fully protective. This is reflected by reduced neuroinflammation and skewing toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. The protective effects from the HF diet are multifaceted. Metabolically, HF increased lipid storage in immune cells, correlating with their increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. Transcriptionally and epigenetically, HF feeding preprogrammed naïve T cells toward a less activated but more tolerogenic phenotype. It is showcased that manipulating diets is a potentially efficient and cost-effective approach to prevent and/or ameliorate EAE. This exhibits translational potentials for prevention/intervention of MS and possibly other autoimmune diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) consists of applying insulins with different action profiles and ingesting known amounts of nutrients from the diet. Although there is no specific recommendation regarding the distribution of these macronutrients, low-carbohydrate (LC) diets seem to show promise in some types of diabetes, but their role in T1D is still controversial, given the potential glycemic improvement, but with the concurrent possibility of changes in other parameters such as lipids. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the metabolic effects of these diets on T1D. METHODS: A systematic review in PubMed, Embase, and Lilacs with publications from the last 10 years was used as a data source. RESULTS: Nine clinical trials were included. We have found LC diet to be associated with increased time in range in continuous glucose monitoring (+5.68 %, p = 0.01); decreased time below range (-0.53 %, p = 0.01 with 54 mg/dL threshold and -2.28 %; p = 0.01 with 70 mg/dL threshold), coefficient of variation (-5.51 %; p = 0.01), total insulin daily dose (-8.39 %; p = 0.01), and systolic blood pressure (-4.83 mmHg, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: LC diets show potential benefit in metabolic control of people living with T1D, warranting the design of future robust clinical trials."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) diet lipids are often overlooked for obesity management. We hypothesized that unsaturated lipids enhance fatty acid metabolism, and influence obesity-related metainflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Swiss mice were fed an obesity-inducing diet for ten weeks. Subsequently, the obese mice were divided into four groups, each receiving a LCHF diet enriched with different types of lipids: saturated fatty acids (SFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ω-3, PUFA ω-6, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) ω-9 during six weeks as an obesity intervention. For comparison, a lean control (CTL) group and an obesity control (HFC) group were also included, spanning the entire 16-week experimental protocol. We evaluated body mass gain, fatty acid profiles via gas chromatography, elongase, and desaturase activities, NFκBp65 expression by western blotting, and cytokine by ELISA kits in serum, liver, and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RET) samples. Our results highlight that ω-3 and ω-9 LCHF diets facilitate weight loss and enhance unsaturated fatty acid incorporation in liver, RET, and serum compared to the other groups. The ω-3 LCHF diet notably reduced the ω-6/ω-3 ratio and improved inflammatory status by reducing cytokines such as IL-4, IL-17, IL-33, CXCL1/KC, and inhibiting NFκBp65 activity compared to the HFC group. Desaturase (delta-9 desaturase-18, delta-6 desaturase) and elongase (ELOVL5 and ELOVL6) activities were modulated in liver, RET, and serum samples by ω-3 and ω-9 compared to the HFC group. CONCLUSIONS: ω-3 and ω-9 fats were most effective in obesity treatment with the LCHF diet, highlighting the significance of lipid type in carbohydrate-restriction for obesity management."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity frequently persists into adulthood and is associated with an increased risk and earlier onset of cardiovascular disease in later life. Behavioral change strategies have been proposed as the first-line weight management approach for children and adolescents with obesity. Nonpharmacological interventions, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) auricular acupressure treatment and intermittent low-carbohydrate diet (ILCD), are increasingly being investigated in the young obese population. However, there is limited high-quality evidence about effectiveness and safety in weight control and reducing cardiometabolic risk in the pediatric population. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effect of cardiometabolic risk reduction between TCM auricular acupressure treatment (TAAT) and ILCD in children with overweight or obesity with gastric-heat and dampness-obstruction syndrome. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants are children with overweight or obesity and enrolled at the obesity clinic of the department of TCM at a tertiary children's hospital. Eligible participants must meet the following criteria: (1) be aged between 6 and 18 years, (2) be overweight, and (3) have gastric-heat and dampness-obstruction syndrome. Recruited children will be randomized 3:1 to receive either TAAT or a self-administered ILCD for 1 month: 150 in the TAAT group and 50 in the ILCD group. The primary outcome is the change in body weight from the beginning of treatment to the end of 1 month. Secondary outcomes included body weight, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, BMI, blood pressure, body fat content, indexes of liver and renal function, indexes of glucose metabolism, gut microbiota, and TCM syndrome scores at the end of 1 month and 3 months, respectively. Primary statistical analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat strategy. A generalized linear model was used to compare the difference in weight change between the groups, with the baseline body weight as the covariate, to obtain the estimate of the mean difference in body weight change and its 95% CI, using Gaussian for family function and identity for link function. RESULTS: The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethical committee and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on May 5, 2023, before recruitment. Recruitment began in June 2023 and is expected to be completed by December 2025. As of November 2024, we have enrolled 112 participants. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial will provide evidence on the treatment effects and safety of TAAT versus ILCD among children with overweight or obesity with gastric-heat and dampness-obstruction syndrome, in reducing body weight and improving cardiometabolic risks. Exploratory aims include potential underlying mechanisms of the 2 kinds of interventions, based on biosamples.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While decreased protein intake is associated with muscle mass loss, it is unclear whether a decrease in carbohydrate intake adversely affects muscle atrophy independently of protein intake. Herein, we examined whether a low-carbohydrate (low-CHO) diet exacerbates denervation-induced muscle atrophy under conditions of identical protein intake. METHODS: On day one of the experiment, male Wistar rats underwent unilateral denervation. The contralateral leg was used as the control. After denervation, rats were divided into two dietary groups: high-carbohydrate (high-CHO) and low-CHO. Each group was fed a high-CHO (70% carbohydrate) or low-CHO (20% carbohydrate) diet over 7 days. Total protein and energy intakes in both groups were matched by pair feeding. Rats were provided with deuterium oxide (D2O) tracer over the last 3 days of dietary intervention to quantify myofibrillar (muscle) protein synthesis (MPS). RESULTS: Denervation reduced wet weight of the gastrocnemius muscle compared to the contralateral control (p < 0.05). Reductions in gastrocnemius muscle weight were greater in the low-CHO group (-34%) than the high-CHO group (-28%) (p < 0.05). Although denervation decreased MPS compared to the contralateral control (p < 0.05), no dietary effect on MPS was observed. Denervation resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of Atrogin-1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, compared to that in the contralateral control (p < 0.05). Increases in Atrogin-1 gene and protein expression due to denervation were greater in the low-CHO group than in the high-CHO group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a low-CHO diet may exacerbate denervation-induced atrophy in fast-twitch-dominant muscles compared to a high-CHO diet, even when the same protein intake is maintained. Although blunted MPS contributed to muscle atrophy due to denervation, exacerbation of muscle atrophy by the low-CHO diet was not accompanied by explanatory changes in MPS. The effect of the low-CHO diet might be related to promotion of muscle-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase gene expression.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), located in the mitochondrion-associated membranes (MAMs), is an important biomarker for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and plays a crucial role in the advancement of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Despite its significance, current methods to monitor MAFLD progression and treatment response are limited. This study aims to address this gap by utilizing [18F]F-TZ3108, an effecient tracer targeting Sig-1R, to quantitatively assess MAFLD progression and the efficacy of a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) as a potential therapeutic intervention. METHODS: The C57 BL/6 J mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD) or regular diet (CTR) for 12 weeks, and the progression of MAFLD was continuously monitored at 0, 4, 8, 12 weeks via [18F]F-TZ3108 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and ex vivo assessment. After confirming successful induction, LDC intervention was administered in the HFD group for 2 weeks. And relevant post-treatment evaluations were also performed. RESULTS: PET/CT revealed a continuous decline in the hepatic binding potential (BPND) of [18F]F-TZ3108 in mice in the HFD group during the induction period, when compared with the BPND in the CTR group. This reduction was significant after the 4th week of induction (p < 0.05). Furthermore, following intervention with LCD, there was a significant improvement in BPND (LCD vs HFD, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that LCD therapy effectively mitigates MAFLD progression. Furthermore, the use of PET imaging with [18F]F-TZ3108 provides a reliable, non-invasive method for monitoring the progression and treatment response of MAFLD, offering significant potential for early detection and personalized treatment evaluation."

      "abstract": "SUMMARY: A 17-year-old girl presented with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, associated with severe hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, despite being on intensive insulin therapy for the last 10 years. She had severe acanthosis nigricans, generalized loss of subcutaneous fat and prominent veins over extremities. The serum levels of glucose and triglyceride did not reduce significantly, even with maximally tolerated doses of metformin (2 g), pioglitazone (45 mg) and fenofibrate (160 mg), not uncommonly seen in poor rural families in West Bengal, India. A detailed dietary recall revealed a very high carbohydrate intake (70% of total calorie) with very low protein and fat intake. A switch to a very low carbohydrate (30% of total calorie) diet led to a remarkable improvement in glucose and lipid profiles (the daily insulin requirement came down by 50% and triglyceride level came down to 600 mg/dL from 950 mg/dL). A whole-exome sequencing study confirmed congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4. A carbohydrate restriction strategy may improve difficult-to-control glycometabolic profile in lipodystrophic subjects on high-carbohydrate diet. LEARNING POINTS: Lipodystrophy should be suspected in patient presenting with hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and low BMI. A very low carbohydrate diet (30% of total daily calorie intake) may significantly improve glucose and lipid profiles in patients with lipoatrophic diabetes. Blood glucose may be the most important initial step to control hypertriglyceridemia and risk of pancreatitis in this group of patients."

Low-carbohydrate diets have emerged as a potential intervention, yet clinical evidence remains inconclusive. PURPOSE: This meta-analysis assesses the impact of low-carbohydrate diets on metabolic profiles in overweight or obese T2DM patients, aiming to guide clinical practice. METHODS: A systematic review identified randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing low-carbohydrate diets to control diets in T2DM patients from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases up to April 2023. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs, encompassing 1,197 participants, demonstrated that low-carbohydrate diets significantly improved HbA1c levels and fasting plasma glucose (mean difference [MD] = -0.36, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.29, p < 0.00001; MD = -10.71, 95% CI -14.39 to -7.03, p < 0.00001). They also reduced triglycerides and increased HDL cholesterol (MD = -19.91, 95% CI -28.83 to -10.99, p < 0.00001; MD = 2.49, 95% CI 1.07-3.91, p = 0.0006), without affecting LDL and total cholesterol. Weight loss, reduced BMI, lower diastolic blood pressure, and decreased waist circumference were additional benefits. CONCLUSION: Low-carbohydrate diets may enhance glycemic control and lipid profiles in overweight or obese T2DM patients, warranting consideration in T2DM management. However, the variability in diet definitions and methodologies underscores the necessity for further research to standardize dietary guidelines and evaluate long-term effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent chronic pain condition that can significantly impact quality of life and contribute to recognized chronic pain racial disparities. We have shown that a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) can reduce KOA-related pain. Our previous work suggested that the LCD was more beneficial for women and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) adults, but our sample was not sufficiently diverse. Thus, we sought to determine whether the LCD may be beneficial for NHB women with KOA on measures of self-reported and evoked pain. METHODS: Fourteen NHB women (M = 55.93, S.D. = 7.79 years of age) with KOA were recruited to participate in a pilot 6-week LCD intervention. Measures of pain sensitivity, disability, physical functioning, overall chronic pain, quality of life, and dietary habits were taken at baseline and at 3- and 6-weeks of the LCD intervention. RESULTS: Overall, participants showed significant differences in self-reported measures of daily pain, pain interference, stiffness, physical functioning, depressive symptoms, food knowledge and food security. Participants also showed reduced evoked pain in the timed walk and chair stand tasks. CONCLUSION: A 6-week LCD provided a range of benefits related to pain and quality of life in NHB women with KOA. The utilization of a LCD is a modifiable, non-pharmacological and accessible alternative for chronic KOA that may reduce pain disparities and improve quality of life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who were randomly divided into two groups: conventional (conventional CSII + traditional lifestyle guidance); and intensive (intensive CSII + LCD lifestyle guidance). CSII was used for blood glucose control, with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) used to monitor blood glucose levels. The primary outcome measure was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level; secondary outcomes included body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, glycemic control, and biochemical indices. RESULTS: The time in range (TIR) in the intensive treatment group was greater than that in the conventional treatment group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with the conventional treatment group, diabetes remission rates were significantly greater in the intensive treatment group (P < 0.05). In the intensive treatment group, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, Homeostasis Model assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and changes in body weight, BMI, visceral fat area (VFA), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) decreased significantly (P < 0.05). FPG, HOMA-IR, TG, LDL-c, and changes in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and VFA were significantly correlated with HbA1c levels (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of intensive CSII and LCD lifestyle guidance had been improved the remission rate in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lipedema is a common, yet underdiagnosed, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) disorder. The main characteristics are SAT expansion in the lower extremities and arms, pain, and tenderness to palpation. It remains unknown if a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) influences SAT in females with lipedema. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a LCD low-energy diet, compared to a low-fat isoenergetic control diet, on calf subcutaneous adipose tissue area, muscle area, SAT/muscle ratio, calf circumference and body composition in females with lipedema. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Adult females with obesity and lipedema were randomized to 1,200 kcal/day diets, either LCD or control (75 and 180 g/day of carbohydrates, respectively) for 8 weeks. Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis, calf SAT area, muscle area, and circumference with magnetic resonance imaging and pain with brief pain inventory, before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Thirteen participants were included (five in the LCD group), with a mean age of 46 ± 12 years and a BMI of 37 ± 6 kg/m2. A significant reduction in calf SAT area, calf circumference, and pain was observed in the LCD group only. Both LCD and control groups experienced a significant reduction body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, and muscle area, with no differences between groups. No significant changes over time were found for SAT/muscle ratio. CONCLUSION: A LCD has the potential to reduce SAT and pain in females with lipedema, despite a reduction in muscle mass in lipedema affected areas in both diet groups. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore potential mechanisms.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder for women of reproductive age, is associated with increased risk for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Current PCOS treatments insufficiently address the spectrum and severity of the disorder, and there is little evidence-based guidance available for lifestyle management of PCOS, especially through nutritional approaches. Some evidence shows that a very low-carbohydrate diet can improve glucose control compared to low-fat or moderate-carbohydrate diets, leading to improved glucose control and insulin levels that may help to treat symptoms of PCOS. This research investigates whether a very low-carbohydrate diet is more effective in improving glucose control and decreasing symptoms of PCOS in comparison to a DASH diet. METHODS: The SUPER study aims to address the gap in knowledge about nutritional advice for people with PCOS through a randomized, comparative effectiveness trial comparing two approaches to glucose control: the dietary approaches to stopping hypertension (DASH) diet, and a very low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet. We will randomize 184 women with PCOS with body mass indexes (BMIs) between 25 and 50 kg/m2 to a VLC or DASH diet. All participants will follow a 24-session, 12-month, online diet, and lifestyle intervention that teaches their assigned diet. Participants will receive nutritional education, support from diet coaches, and education about behavioral strategies to improve dietary adherence. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c, and secondary outcomes include glucose variance, lipid and hormone levels (including total and free testosterone), PCOS symptoms, inflammation (measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), body composition and weight, psychological well-being, and intervention feasibility and acceptability. DISCUSSION: The SUPER study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial that compares two promising approaches to glucose control in people with PCOS. The study also aims to assess the effects of each diet on PCOS symptoms. The research addresses an important gap in knowledge regarding nutritional advice for people with PCOS.

In this 12-week two-by-two factorial randomized trial with a 28-week follow-up among 96 participants with overweight or obesity, isocaloric-restricted feeding yields significant weight loss, ranging from 2.57 to 4.11 kg across different groups. Beyond caloric restriction, HLCD and TRE lead to additional reduction in body mass index. HLCD results in additional fat mass loss while TRE yields more lean mass loss. Additionally, HLCD leads to decreased fecal branched-chain amino acids, and TRE tends to yield an increased abundance of probiotic species involved in synthesizing short-chain fatty acids. Moreover, the effect of HLCD on reducing fat mass is sustained during the post-intervention follow-up. Overall, HLCD and TRE are effective in weight management and yield profound gut microbiome and metabolome alteration beyond caloric restriction.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of diet-related non-communicable diseases has increased. A low-carbohydrate diet (LCDs) is one of the most popular interventions. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs have linked LCDs to the management of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, and cancer. However, there has been limited appraisal of the strength and quality of this evidence. OBJECTIVE: To systematically appraise existing meta-analyses and systematic reviews of RCTs and non-RCTs on the effects of LCDs on different health conditions. To understand their potential efficacy, we summarised the studies' findings and assessed the strength of the evidence. METHODS: A search was conducted using the PubMed database from inception to October 2021 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs and non-RCTs investigating the association between LCDs and multiple health outcomes in humans. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria was used for the quality assessment. In addition, the evolution of heterogeneity, strength of the included studies, and effect sizes were extracted from each systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. Of the included reviews, 70% were of positive quality, 30% were neutral, and none were negative. The majority of the studies included strength in each systematic review, and the meta-analyses were of low to medium strength. The existing literature indicates that LCDs may help promote weight reduction in adults who are obese or overweight. This conclusion is supported by the findings of studies included in the analysis, which were of low to moderate strength. Furthermore, compelling data indicates a significant association between low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) and a reduction in haemoglobin A1c levels among those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In contrast, there was a lack of evidence of this correlation in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients or those with cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, there was limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of LCDs in epilepsy and adult cancer patients. CONCLUSION: This review thoroughly examines the current body of information on how LCDs affect various health outcomes. Studies have presented evidence to support the idea that incorporating LCDs can positively influence weight management and HbA1c levels. However, there is a lack of information regarding the association between LCDs and individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, there is limited empirical evidence to substantiate the effectiveness of LCDs in the treatment of epilepsy and adult cancer patients. The long-term effects of LCDs on mortality and other chronic diseases that account for different carbohydrate subtypes is unclear. Further longitudinal cohort studies are required to reach definitive conclusions."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: South Asians, especially Indians, face higher diabetes-related risks despite lower body mass index (BMI) compared with the White population. Limited research connects low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF)/ketogenic diets to metabolic changes in this group. Systematic studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of the diet, such as ocular health. METHOD: In this prospective, observational study, 465 candidates aged 25-75 years with type 2 diabetes included with institutional ethics approval. A total of 119 subjects were included in the final study assessment based on the availability of pathophysiological reports, tears, and blood samples collected at baseline, 3rd, and 6th months. Serum and tear samples were analyzed by an enzyme-linked lectinsorbent assay, to examine secreted soluble protein biomarkers, such as IL-1β (interleukin 1 Beta), IL-6 (interleukin 6), IL-10 (interleukin 10), IL-17A (interleukin 17A), MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A), and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha). A Wilcoxon test was performed for paired samples. Spearman's correlation was applied to test the strength and direction of the association between tear biomarkers and HbA1c. p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: After a 3- and 6-month LCHF intervention, fasting blood sugar decreased by 10% (Δ: -14 mg/dL; p < 0.0001) and 7% (Δ: -8 mg/dL; p < 0.0001), respectively. Glycated hemoglobin A1c levels decreased by 13% (Δ: -1%; p < 0.0001) and 9% (Δ: -0.6%; p < 0.0001). Triglycerides reduced by 22% (Δ: -27 mg/dL; p < 0.0001) and 14% (Δ: -19 mg/dL; p < 0.0001). Total cholesterol reduced by 5.4% (Δ: -10.5 mg/dL; p < 0.003) and 4% (Δ: -7 mg/dL; p < 0.03), while low-density lipoprotein decreased by 10% (Δ: -11.5 mg/dL; p < 0.003) and 9% (Δ: -11 mg/dL; p < 0.002). High-density lipoprotein increased by 11% (Δ: 5 mg/dL; p < 0.0001) and 17% (Δ: 8 mg/dL; p < 0.0001). At the first follow-up, tear proteins such as ICAM-1, IL-17A, and TNF-α decreased by 30% (Δ: -2,739 pg/mL; p < 0.01), 22% (Δ: -4.5 pg/mL; p < 0.02), and 34% (Δ: -0.9 pg/mL; p < 0.002), respectively. At the second follow-up, IL-1β and TNF-α reduced by 41% (Δ: -2.4 pg/mL; p < 0.05) and 34% (Δ: -0.67 pg/mL; p < 0.02). Spearman's correlation between HbA1c and tear analytes was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The LCHF diet reduces the risk of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Changes in tear fluid protein profiles were observed, but identifying promising candidate biomarkers requires validation in a larger cohort."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The low-carbohydrate-ketogenic diet, an effective strategy to address metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obesity has raised concerns about high-fat consumption on atherogenic lipoproteins. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the Asian ketogenic diet (AKD), which incorporates balanced protein and fat intake from Asian foods, with a balanced low-caloric diet (BLC) in individuals diagnosed with MetS. METHODS: A 52-wk randomized clinical trial included 3 parallel groups: AKD with increased whole egg intake [egg yolk Asian ketogenic diet (Yolk-AKD, n = 28)], yolk-free ketogenic diet with egg white supplementation [egg white Asian ketogenic diet (White-AKD, n = 26)], and BLC (n = 22). Primary outcomes were anthropometric and metabolic changes. RESULTS: The AKD groups achieved significant reductions in weight and waist circumference (P < 0.05). Compared with the BLC group, the AKD groups demonstrated significant improvements in insulin resistance at week 6 and in triglyceride concentrations at weeks 12 (Yolk-AKD) and 35 (White-AKD) (P < 0.05). The AKD groups experienced improvements in hormones associated with insulin sensitivity and appetite, whereas only the Yolk-AKD group had a significant decrease in inflammation-related hormones (P < 0.05). From weeks 35-52, the AKD maintained reductions in anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, improved glucose tolerance, enhanced lipid profiles, and better liver function compared with the BLC. CONCLUSIONS: The AKD proved safe and effective, yielding various metabolic improvements in individuals with MetS compared with the BLC. Emphasizing a low-saturated fat diet while disregarding dietary cholesterol, this approach holds promise for MetS and obesity management. The inclusion of both White-AKD and Yolk-AKD groups allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the AKD's impact, elucidating the differential effects of whole egg consumption on metabolic outcomes. Further studies are warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04608136.",

Low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) and time-restricted eating (TRE) have been confirmed to be effective methods for weight management and improving MetS, but their effects on the myocardium and thyroid are unclear. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis in a randomized clinical diet-induced weight-loss trial. Participants (N = 169) diagnosed with MetS were randomized to the LCD group, the 8 h TRE group, or the combination of the LCD and TRE group for 3 months. Myocardial enzymes and thyroid function were tested before and after the intervention. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation was assessed between functions of the myocardium and thyroid and cardiometabolic parameters at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 162 participants who began the trial were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and 57 participants who adhered to their assigned protocol were involved in the per-protocol (PP) analysis. Relative to baseline, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase MB, hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and free triiodothyronine (FT3) declined, and free thyroxine (FT4) increased after all 3 interventions (both analyses). Creatine kinase (CK) decreased only in the TRE (- 18 [44] U/L, P < 0.001) and combination (- 22 [64] U/L, P = 0.003) groups (PP analysis). Thyrotropin (- 0.24 [0.83] μIU/mL, P = 0.011) and T3 (- 0.10 ± 0.04 ng/mL, P = 0.011) decreased in the combination group (ITT analysis). T4 (0.82 ± 0.39 μg/dL, P = 0.046), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb, 2 [1] %, P = 0.021), and thyroid microsomal antibodies (TMAb, 2 [2] %, P < 0.001) increased, while the T3/T4 ratio (- 0.01 ± 0.01, P = 0.020) decreased only in the TRE group (PP analysis). However, no significant difference between groups was observed in either analysis. At baseline, CK was positively correlated with the visceral fat area. FT3 was positively associated with triglycerides and total cholesterol. FT4 was negatively related to insulin and C-peptide levels. TgAb and TMAb were negatively correlated with the waist-to-hip ratio.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Time-restricted eating (TRE) and low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) can improve multiple cardiometabolic parameters in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), but their effects on psychosocial health and satiety are unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of TRE, LCD, and their combination (TRE + LCD) on quality of life (QoL), sleep, mood, appetite, and metabolic hormones in patients with MetS. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a single-center, 3-month, open-label, randomized clinical trial investigating the effects of TRE, LCD, and TRE + LCD on weight and cardiometabolic parameters in individuals with MetS. This secondary analysis examined QoL, sleep, mood, and appetite using the Rand 36-Item Short Form (SF-36); Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; and Eating Behavior Rating Scale, respectively, as well as measured levels of metabolic hormones including leptin, amylin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and peptide YY. Between-group comparisons were conducted via one-way ANOVAs and post hoc LSD tests for normally distributed variables or Kruskal‒Wallis H tests and the Nemenyi test for abnormally distributed variables. P < 0.017 was considered significant in multiple comparisons following Bonferroni adjustment. RESULTS: A total of 162 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.2 [9.9] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 29.3 [3.4] kg/m2; 102 [63%] men) who started the intervention were analyzed. After 3 months, only the TRE group decreased GLP-1 levels (-0.9 [IQR, -1.9 to -0.3] pg/mL; P = 0.002), increased PP levels (8.9 [IQR, -7.6 to 71.8] pg/mL; P = 0.011), physical functioning in the SF-36 (5.2 [95% CI, 1.9 to 8.5]; P = 0.001), social functioning in the SF-36 (9.1 [95% CI, 2.5 to 15.6]; P = 0.005), role-physical in the SF-36 (24.1 [95% CI, 11.8 to 36.4]; P < 0.001), role-emotional in the SF-36 (22.4 [95% CI, 12.6 to 32.2]; P < 0.001), and sleep efficiency in the PSQI (0.29 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.55]; P = 0.021). Compared with changes in LCD, TRE further increased general health in the SF-36 (9.7 [95% CI, 3.3 to 16.0]; P = 0.006). Relative to the changes of TRE + LCD, TRE significantly increased role-emotional in the SF-36 (19.9 [95% CI 4.9 to 34.8]; P = 0.006). Changes in sleep quality, mood status, appetite, and metabolic hormones did not differ among three groups. Greater weight loss was associated with decreased leptin levels (r = 0.538), decreased amylin levels (r = 0.294), reduced total appetite scores (r = 0.220), and improved general health (r = -0.253) (all P ≤ 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TRE, LCD, and TRE + LCD all could improve psychosocial health and reduce appetite. Notably, TRE yielded greater benefits in QoL compared with LCD or TRE + LCD in individuals with MetS.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This manuscript performed a meta-analysis to compare the effects of a low-fat diet (LFD) and a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) on body weight and lipid levels in adolescents with overweight and obesity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PubMed and other databases were searched for the full-text literature comparing LFD and LCD up to November 2023 using a subject plus free word strategy, with search terms such as \"low-fat diet\", \"low-carbohydrate diet\", \"obesity\", \"weight\", \"adolescents\", \"RCT\", and so on. Two independent reviewers selected promising candidate trials, collected the data, and assessed the quality of the trials. RevMan 5.3 software was utilized to conduct a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were included. RESULTS: 5 RCTs with 192 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Weight (mean difference -2.81; 95% CI -5.38 to -0.25), Body Mass Index (BMI) (-1.13; 95% CI -2.14 to -0.11) and Triglyceride (TG) (-0.36; 95% CI -0.46 to -0.27) of the LCD were significantly lower than that of the LFD. At the same time, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels of the LCD were significantly higher than those of the LFD (0.08; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12) (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), percent body fat, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: According to this study, LCD is more helpful in improving weight loss, HDL and TG. Thus, LCD may serve as an effective intervention for weight management in adolescents with overweight and obesity, although further research is needed to determine its long-term effects."

Initial presentation was 50-year-old white male with a long-standing history of obesity and a family history of T2D with a screening glucose level >500mg/dL by glucometer, HbA1c of 14.9%, and initial weight 213 lbs. METHODS: The initial intervention included a low-carbohydrate diet, metformin, and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Semaglutide was added after seven days. RESULTS: His glycemia was within the target range within three weeks. Four weeks after initiation of therapy, he developed TIND symptoms consisting of burning, tightness, and numbness of bilateral feet along with 10/10 pain. At three months, his HbA1c dropped to 6.9% and his weight to 195 lbs. Treatment of his TIND reduced his pain from 10/10 to 2/10. CONCLUSION: Whereas TIND is commonly associated with the use of insulin or sulfonylureas, this study adds evidence to the paucity of literature regarding TIND precipitated by dietary intervention."

      "abstract": "In an increasingly aging and overweight population, osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are major public health concerns. T2DM patients experience prejudicial effects on their bone health, affecting their physical capacity. Exercise in hypoxia (EH) and a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) have been suggested for therapeutic benefits in T2DM, improving bone mineral content (BMC) and glycemic control. This study investigated the effects of EH combined with an LCD on body composition and functional and physiologic capacity in T2DM patients. Older T2DM patients (n = 42) were randomly assigned to the following groups: (1) control group: control diet + exercise in normoxia; (2) EH group: control diet + EH; (3) intervention group: LCD + EH. Cardiopulmonary tests (BRUCE protocol), body composition (DEXA), and functional capacity (6MWT, handgrip strength) were evaluated. Body mass index (kg/m2) and body fat (%) decreased in all groups (p < 0.001). BMC (kg) increased in all groups (p < 0.001) and was significantly higher in the EH and EH + LCD groups (p < 0.001). VO2peak improved in all groups (p < 0.001), but more so in the hypoxia groups (p = 0.019). Functional capacity was increased in all groups (p < 0.001), but more so in the EH group in 6MWT (p = 0.030). EH with and without an LCD is a therapeutic strategy for improving bone mass in T2DM, which is associated with cardiorespiratory and functional improvements.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary advice and medical treatments are recommended to patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies have not yet compared the efficacy of dietary treatment with pharmacological treatment targeting the predominant IBS symptom. We therefore aimed to compare the effects of two restrictive dietary treatment options versus optimised medical treatment in people with IBS. METHODS: This single-centre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a specialised outpatient clinic at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Participants (aged ≥18 years) with moderate-to-severe IBS (Rome IV; IBS Severity Scoring System [IBS-SSS] ≥175) and no other serious diseases or food allergies were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by web-based randomisation to receive a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) plus traditional IBS dietary advice recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (hereafter the LFTD diet), a fibre-optimised diet low in total carbohydrates and high in protein and fat (hereafter the low-carbohydrate diet), or optimised medical treatment based on predominant IBS symptom. Participants were masked to the names of the diets, but the pharmacological treatment was open-label. The intervention lasted 4 weeks, after which time participants in the dietary interventions were unmasked to their diets and encouraged to continue during 6 months' follow-up, participants in the LFTD group were instructed on how to reintroduce FODMAPs, and participants receiving pharmacological treatment were offered diet counselling and to continue with their medication. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who responded to the 4-week intervention, defined as a reduction of 50 or more in IBS-SSS relative to baseline, and was analysed per modified intention-to-treat (ie, all participants who started the intervention). Safety was analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02970591, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24, 2017, and Sept 2, 2021, 1104 participants were assessed for eligibility and 304 were randomly assigned. Ten participants did not receive their intervention after randomisation and thus 294 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat population (96 assigned to the LFTD diet, 97 to the low-carbohydrate diet, and 101 to optimised medical treatment). 241 (82%) of 294 participants were women and 53 (18%) were men and the mean age was 38 (SD 13). After 4 weeks, 73 (76%) of 96 participants in the LFTD diet group, 69 (71%) of 97 participants in the low-carbohydrate diet group, and 59 (58%) of 101 participants in the optimised medical treatment group had a reduction of 50 or more in IBS-SSS compared with baseline, with a significant difference between the groups (p=0·023). 91 (95%) of 96 participants completed 4 weeks in the LFTD group, 92 (95%) of 97 completed 4 weeks in the low-carbohydrate group, and 91 (90%) of 101 completed 4 weeks in the optimised medical treatment group. Two individuals in each of the intervention groups stated that adverse events were the reason for discontinuing the 4-week intervention. Five (5%) of 91 participants in the optimised medical treatment group stopped treatment prematurely due to side-effects. No serious adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Two 4-week dietary interventions and optimised medical treatment reduced the severity of IBS symptoms, with a larger effect size in the diet groups. Dietary interventions might be considered as an initial treatment for patients with IBS. Research is needed to enable personalised treatment strategies.

METHODS: We included 3640 adults aged 45-80 years from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey programme (2008-2016) with data on dietary intake, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. Four hypothetical interventions were examined: (1) LCD, (2) Low carbohydrate (LC) and high fibre diet (LCHF), (3) LC and high saturated fat diet (LCHS) and (4) LC and high unsaturated fat diet (LCHU). BMI and WC were used as markers of obesity. Biochemical markers included HbA1c, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and C reactive protein (CRP). BMI, WC and HbA1c were used as a mediator of the effects. The analysis was adjusted for sociodemographic characteristic, smoking, estimated total energy intake, alcohol consumption and antihypertensive medication. To identify a potential causal effect of LCD on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, we estimated the average treatment effect, and corresponding p values and CI for the total, indirect and direct effect of the treatment on the outcome. RESULTS: BMI, WC and HbA1c fully mediated the association between LCD and triglycerides and fully mediated the effects of LCHF on LDL, although BMI and WC were not sufficient to fully mediate the effects of LCHF on triglycerides and CRP. BMI alone fully mediated the effects of LCHS on HbA1c, triglycerides, LDL and CRP. None of these mediators explained the effect of LCHU on CVD risk markers. CONCLUSION: The causal hypotheses tested in this study demonstrate that individuals on LCD with high fibre intakes improved their CVD markers as expected, but those on LCD who increase fat intake had no effects on CVD markers mediated by obesity and diabetes."

Recently, islet cell heterogeneity, exemplified by β-cell dedifferentiation and identified in diabetic animals, has attracted attention as an underlying molecular mechanism of β-cell dysfunction. Previously, we reported β-cell dedifferentiation suppression by calorie restriction, not by reducing hyperglycemia using hypoglycemic agents (including sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors), in an obese diabetic mice model (db/db). Here, to explore further mechanisms of the effects of food intake on β-cell function, db/db mice were fed either a high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet (db-HC) or a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet (db-HF) using similar calorie restriction regimens. After one month of intervention, body weight reduced, and glucose intolerance improved to a similar extent in the db-HC and db-HF groups. However, β-cell dedifferentiation did not improve in the db-HC group, and β-cell mass compensatory increase occurred in this group. More prominent fat accumulation occurred in the db-HC group livers. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism, mainly regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ, differed significantly between groups. In conclusion, the fat/carbohydrate ratio in food during calorie restriction in obese mice affected both liver lipid metabolism and β-cell dedifferentiation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-carbohydrate and high-fat diet (LCHF) models have been widely explored as alternatives for treating obesity and promoting weight loss. Their effect is attributed to the change in energy substrate that stimulates ketogenic pathways that can metabolically overload the liver. However, little has been studied about the impact of lipid sources prioritized in the LCHF diet. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the impact of different fat sources in the LCHF diet on markers of liver injury, oxidative stress, and epigenetics in obesity. METHODS: Adult male mice were initially induced to obesity by a high-fat and high-sugar diet for 10 wk. Subsequently, they underwent a weight-loss treatment intervention involving an LCHF diet with various sources of fats, including saturated, omega-3 (ω-3) (n-3), omega-6 (ω-6) (n-6), and omega-9 (ω-9) (n-9). At the end of the treatment, markers of liver injury, oxidative stress, and epigenetics were evaluated. RESULTS: The LCHF diet was effective in inducing weight loss. However, unsaturated lipid sources (omegas) exhibited superior outcomes. Specifically, the ω-9 group displayed diminished oxidative stress concentrations and decreased markers of liver injury. The ω-3 group demonstrated efficacy in modulating epigenetic markers, thereby reducing oxidative stress, mutagenicity, and markers of liver injury. Correlation tests demonstrated that there was an interaction between the activity of antioxidants and epigenetic enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that LCHF diets associated with ω-3 and ω-9 have the potential for weight loss and liver health recovery in obesity through antioxidant and epigenetic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY: The use of a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) reduces insulin requirements in insulinopenic states such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, the use of potentially ketogenic diets in this clinical setting is contentious and the mechanisms underlying their impact on glycaemic control are poorly understood. We report a case of a patient with a late-onset classic presentation of T1DM who adopted a very low-carbohydrate diet and completely avoided insulin therapy for 18 months, followed by tight glycaemic control on minimal insulin doses. The observations suggest that adherence to an LCD in T1DM, implemented soon after diagnosis, can facilitate an improved and less variable glycaemic profile in conjunction with temporary remission in some individuals. Importantly, these changes occurred in a manner that did not lead to a significant increase in blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate) concentrations. This case highlights the need for further research in the form of randomised controlled trials to assess the long-term safety and sustainability of carbohydrate-reduced diets in T1DM. LEARNING POINTS: This case highlights the potential of low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to mediate improved diabetes control and possible remission soon after diagnosis. Could carbohydrate-reduced diets implemented early in the course of T1DM delay the decline in endogenous insulin production? Adherence to an LCD in T1DM can facilitate an improved and less variable glycaemic profile. This case suggests that LCDs in T1DM may not be associated with a concerning supraphysiological ketonaemia."

      "abstract": "Low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) are frequently recommended for alleviating obesity, and the gut microbiota plays key roles in energy metabolism and weight loss. However, there is limited in-human research on how LCD changes gut microbiota. In this before-after study, 43 participants were assigned to the LCD intervention for 4 weeks. The main objective was to investigate the specific changes that occur in the participants' microbiome in response to the LCD. Changes in gut microbiota were analyzed using 16s rRNA sequencing. Body composition was measured using InBody 770. Remarkably, 35 participants (79.07%) lost more than 5% of their body weight; levels of BMI, body fat, and total cholesterol were significantly decreased, indicating the effectiveness of the LCD intervention. The richness of microbiota significantly increased after the intervention. By taking the intersection of ANOVA and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis results, we identified three phyla, three classes, four orders, five families, and six genera that were differentially enriched between baseline and week-4 time points. Among the three phyla, relative abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota decreased significantly, while Bacteroidetes increased significantly. At the genus level, Ruminococcus, Agathobacter, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium showed a significant reduction in relative abundances, whereas Parabacteroides and Bacteroides increased steadily. Our results demonstrate that LCD can effectively alleviate obesity and modify certain taxa of gut microbiota, providing potential insights for personalized dietary interventions against obesity."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Mood disorders are trending to be among the leading causes of years lived with disability. Despite multiple treatment options, around 30% patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) develop treatment resistant depression (TRD) and fail to respond to current pharmacological therapies. This study aimed to explore the potential benefits of nutritional treatment strategies, along with their molecular mechanisms of action, focusing especially on low-carbohydrate diet (LCHD), ketogenic diet (KD) and other strategies based on carbohydrates intake reduction. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to determine the impact of LCHD on alleviating depressive symptoms in patients with MDD, along with an explanation of its mode of action. RESULTS: The study revealed significant impact of nutritional interventions based on restriction in carbohydrate intake such as LCHD, KD or sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) exclusion on anxiety or depression symptoms reduction, mood improvement and lower risk of cognitive impairment or depression. The efficacy of these approaches is further substantiated by their underlying molecular mechanisms, mainly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is a potential key target of sugar restriction diets in terms of neuroplasticity. DISCUSSION: Healthcare professionals may consider implementing LCHD strategies for MDD and TRD patients to modify the disease process, maintain euthymia, and prevent depressive episode relapses. Ranging from the exclusion of SSB to the adherence to rigorous LCHD regimens, these nutritional approaches are safe, straightforward to implement, and may confer benefits for well-being and relapse prevention in this specific patient population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol change with consumption of a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) is highly variable. Identifying the source of this heterogeneity could guide clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate LDL cholesterol change in randomized controlled trials involving LCDs, with a focus on body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2. METHODS: Three electronic indexes (Pubmed, EBSCO, and Scielo) were searched for studies between 1 January, 2003 and 20 December, 2022. Two independent reviewers identified randomized controlled trials involving adults consuming <130 g/d carbohydrate and reporting BMI and LDL cholesterol change or equivalent data. Two investigators extracted relevant data, which were validated by other investigators. Data were analyzed using a random-effects model and contrasted with results of pooled individual participant data. RESULTS: Forty-one trials with 1379 participants and a mean intervention duration of 19.4 wk were included. In a meta-regression accounting for 51.4% of the observed variability on LCDs, mean baseline BMI had a strong inverse association with LDL cholesterol change [β = -2.5 mg/dL/BMI unit, 95% confidence interval (CI): -3.7, -1.4], whereas saturated fat amount was not significantly associated with LDL cholesterol change. For trials with mean baseline BMI <25, LDL cholesterol increased by 41 mg/dL (95% CI: 19.6, 63.3) on the LCD. By contrast, for trials with a mean of BMI 25-<35, LDL cholesterol did not change, and for trials with a mean BMI ≥35, LDL cholesterol decreased by 7 mg/dL (95% CI: -12.1, -1.3). Using individual participant data, the relationship between BMI and LDL cholesterol change was not observed on higher-carbohydrate diets. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial increase in LDL cholesterol is likely for individuals with low but not high BMI with consumption of an LCD, findings that may help guide individualized nutritional management of cardiovascular disease risk. As carbohydrate restriction tends to improve other lipid and nonlipid risk factors, the clinical significance of isolated LDL cholesterol elevation in this context warrants investigation. This trial was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022299278.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity has been steadily increasing over the past four decades, with projections indicating a significant rise in the number of affected individuals by 2045. Therapeutic interventions in T2DM aim to control blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of complications. Dietary and lifestyle modifications play a crucial role in the management of T2DM and obesity. While conventional medical nutritional therapy (MNT) often promotes a high-carbohydrate, low-fat Mediterranean diet as an elective treatment, low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs), specifically those restricting carbohydrate intake to less than 130 g/day, have gained popularity due to their multifaceted benefits. Scientific research supports the efficacy of LCDs in improving glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and overall quality of life. However, sustaining these benefits over the long term remains challenging. This trial aimed to compare the effects of a Mediterranean diet vs. a low-carbohydrate diet (carbohydrate intake < 130 g/day) on overweight/obese patients with T2DM over a 16-week period. The study will evaluate the differential effects of these diets on glycemic regulation, weight reduction, lipid profile, and cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: The study population comprises 100 overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled T2DM. Anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance analysis, and blood chemistry assessments will be conducted at baseline and after the 16-week intervention period. Both dietary interventions were hypocaloric, with a focus on maintaining a 500 kcal/day energy deficit. RESULTS: After 16 weeks, both diets had positive effects on various parameters, including weight loss, blood pressure, glucose control, lipid profile, and renal function. However, the low-carbohydrate diet appears to result in a greater reduction in BMI, blood pressure, waist circumference, glucose levels, lipid profiles, cardiovascular risk, renal markers, and overall metabolic parameters compared to the Mediterranean diet at the 16-week follow up. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet may be more effective than a Mediterranean diet in promoting weight loss and improving various metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight/obese patients with T2DM. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to understand the clinical implications and long-term sustainability of these findings.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY: In patients with diabetes mellitus, the toxic milieu caused by abnormal glucose and free fatty acid handling can lead to heart failure (HF). Referred to as diabetic cardiomyopathy (DMCM), this syndrome often exists in the absence of conventional risk factors for HF such as history of myocardial infarction or hypertension. Low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) have recently been endorsed as an efficacious therapeutic dietary approach to prevent and reverse cardiometabolic disease including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). LCDs improve systemic insulin resistance (IR), reverses cardiac remodelling in a rodent model and downregulates the expression of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) receptors in the kidney. It is therefore conceivable that a lifestyle approach such as adopting an LCD can be offered to patients with DMCM. The reported case is that of a 45-year-old man with a 15-year history of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, T2DM and obesity. The patient volunteered to engage in a 16-week low-carbohydrate dietary intervention trial and then self-selected to remain on this diet for 1 year. The whole-food LCD was based on simple 'traffic light' style food lists and not designed to restrict calories, protein, fat or salt. After 1 year, the patient had lost 39 kg and his cardiometabolic markers had significantly improved. LCDs present a potentially beneficial approach for patients with DMCM and could be considered as a lifestyle intervention before SGLT2i therapy is commenced. LEARNING POINTS: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DMCM) is a syndrome precipitated mainly by the detrimental effects of glucose metabolism disorders such as insulin resistance and diabetes. Low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) mimic many effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). LCDs are a dietary pattern which can have significant and beneficial effects on metabolic and anthropometric markers in patients with DMCM. LCDs and SGLT2i therapy could be combined and may achieve better clinical outcomes for patients with DMCM. Combination therapy may be carried out under close supervision as the real risk for diabetic ketoacidosis remains."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The search for nutritional intervention strategies against obesity has grown, highlighting the low-carbohydrate diet model. However, little is known about the impact of the quality of fatty acids consumed in this diet. Thus, we aim to investigate the influence of fatty acid quality on dietary strategy on obesity. METHODS: Male Swiss mice were diet-induced to obesity. Afterward, mice consume a low-carb diet with different types of fat: saturated, polyunsaturated ω-3, ω-6, and monounsaturated ω-9 fatty acids. Weight gain and food consumption were monitored weekly. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed and blood and tissue samples were collected for analysis of insulin resistance markers. Protein expression of insulin signaling pathway molecules, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, macrophage polarization, and cytokine production were analyzed. RESULTS: The high-fat diet was able to induce obesity and glucose intolerance. The switch to a low-carbohydrate dietary pattern reversed the glucose intolerance, with better results in the ω-3 and ω-9 groups. After the low-carbohydrate diet, groups ω-3 and ω-9 presented improved fasting serum glucose, insulin, and HOMA indexes. The low-carbohydrate diet also increased the activity of insulin pathway proteins such as IR, IRS1, and AKT. Furthermore, the ω-3 diet group showed greater activity of mitochondrial complexes and AMPK signaling pathway proteins. The ω-6 and ω-9 -rich diet induced M2-type macrophage polarization, as well as cytokine production modulation by the low-carbohydrate diet in the ω-3 and ω-9 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Consuming a low-carbohydrate diet pattern promotes weight loss and improves glucose intolerance in obesity. Also, the quality of lipids has a direct influence, demonstrating that the consumption of ω-3 polyunsaturated and ω-9 monounsaturated lipids can lead to more favorable outcomes for the improvement of glucose intolerance, lipid metabolism, and anti-inflammatory effects.",

METHODS: The program consisted of weekly acupuncture sessions combined with a very low-carbohydrate diet in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or above. Data were collected retrospectively between 2002 and 2021 in seven clinics in Switzerland through automated data extraction of existing medical records. The treatments described are standard care at the facilities where they took place. RESULTS: A total of 11,233 patients were included. In those with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or above, a positive effect on body weight was noted with a peak average body weight loss of approximately 17.5 kg reached after 7 months. Long-term stabilization was at about 15.5 kg after 18 months. Significant male-female differences (p < 0.01) were observed with women losing less weight. Differences were also noted between overweight, obese and extremely obese patients suggesting a BMI-dependent effect. Maximum weight loss of patients with BMI of 35 kg/m2 or above was 29.8 ± 12 kg, while it was 18.8 ± 8 kg for obese patients (BMI = 30-34.9 kg/m2) and 12 ± 7 kg for overweight patients (BMI = 25-29.9 kg/m2), reflecting a significant overall difference between groups (p < 0.01). Compliance to the protocol by patients and physicians seemed to be another differentiating factor; more adherent patients appeared to lose more weight and preserve body weight loss better over time. CONCLUSION: Although this study lacked a control group and was retrospective and observational in nature, a program of acupuncture combined with a very low-carbohydrate diet appeared to be effective at inducing weight loss among obese patients. The observed weight reduction in this retrospective chart review represents a good starting point for further investigation of this approach via a comparative evaluation.",

We tested if carbohydrate loading could improve the performance of 17 elite soccer players under ecologically valid circumstances using Global Positioning System (GPS) data. METHODS: Twenty-two adult Iran Premier league soccer players were divided into a carbohydrate-loading group (CLG) and Control group (CG). The carbohydrate loading group restricted carbohydrate intake for three days to 1.5 g/kg/d while increasing exercise intensity. From days four to seven, exercise intensity was decreased and carbohydrate intake was considerably increased up to 7.5 g/kg/d on the day of the match, during which performance was analyzed using GPS data. The control group performed the same exercise training but maintained their habitual carbohydrate intake of 5-6 g/kg/d. The data were analyzed using a univariate ANCOVA with baseline data from a pre-intervention match as the control variable. RESULTS: The carbohydrate loading team scored significantly higher on running distance, maximum speed and the number of top and repeated sprints; the carbohydrate loading group scored significantly lower on player load, metabolic power and running imbalance compared to the control team during their match.

In addition, the insulin-regulated PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway plays an important role in the regulation of islet cell proliferation, and this pathway is hyperactivated in human non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). We, therefore, investigated the effect of a very low carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet) on a mouse model that develops non-functional PanNETs to ask how reduced PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling might affect the development and progression of non-functional PanNET. We found that this dietary intervention resulted in lower PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling in islet cells and a significant reduction in PanNET formation and progression. We also found that this treatment had a significant effect on the suppression of pituitary NET development. Furthermore, we found that non-functional PanNET patients with lower blood glucose levels tend to have a better prognosis than patients with higher blood glucose levels. This preclinical study shows that a dietary intervention that results in lower serum insulin levels leads to lower insulin signals within the neuroendocrine cells and has a striking suppressive effect on the development and progression of both pancreatic and pituitary NETs.",

Web-based interventions can help overcome significant challenges of accessibility and availability of dietary education and support for T2DM. No previous study had evaluated a web-based LCD intervention using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The objective of this study was to assess whether a web-based LCD programme provided in conjunction with standard care improves glycaemic control in adults with T2DM. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A 16-week parallel RCT was conducted remotely during Covid-19 among the general community, recruiting adults with T2DM not on insulin aged 40-89 years. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard care plus the web-based T2Diet healthy LCD education programme (intervention) or standard care only (control). The primary outcome was haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes were weight, body mass index (BMI), anti-glycaemic medication, dietary intake, and self-efficacy. Blinded data analysis was conducted by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: Ninety-eight participants were enrolled, assigning 49 to each group, with 87 participants (n = 40 intervention; n = 47 control) included in outcome analysis. At 16 weeks, there was a statistically significant between-group difference favouring the intervention group, with reductions in HbA1c -0.65% (95% CI: -0.99 to -0.30; p < 0.0001), weight -3.26 kg (p < 0.0001), BMI -1.11 kg/m2 (p < 0.0001), and anti-glycaemic medication requirements -0.40 (p < 0.0001), with large effect sizes Cohen's d > 0.8. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that as an adjunct to standard care, the web-based T2Diet programme significantly improved glycaemic control and clinical outcomes in adults with T2DM. In addition, the results highlight the potential to improve access and availability for people with T2DM to achieve glycaemic control and improved health through web-based dietary education and support.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most frequent endocrine disorders among women of fertile age. Women with PCOS manifest clinical symptoms like menstrual dysfunction, hirsutism, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia. As excessive amounts of insulin levels directly increase ovarian production of androgens, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are considered as the pathogenesis factors of PCOS. The portfolio low-carbohydrate diet (PLCD) is a plant-based diet with 40% carbohydrates combined with five cholesterol-lowering foods and nutrients. On the other hand, the ketogenic diet (KD) is a nutritional protocol with 10% carbohydrates. The purpose of this study is to determine whether PLCD or KD is more effective in alleviating PCOS symptoms. METHODS: Forty-six overweight or obese women diagnosed with PCOS will be randomly stratified to receive either PLCD or KD for 8 weeks. Measures related to anthropometric and body composition, glucose, and insulin level, HOMA-IR, sex hormones, lipid profile, quality of life, dietary intake, physical activity, and Ferriman-Gallwey score of all participants will be accessed before and after the intervention. DISCUSSION: Since the first line treatment of PCOS is lifestyle adjustment including diet control and exercise, there has not been determined the optimal diet for this population of women yet. Hence, the goal of conducting this study is to determine whether the PLCD or the KD could have more advantageous effects on attenuating PCOS manifestations. The result of this investigation will give us new insight into curing this disease and will provide evidence-based recommendations for prescribing an optimal diet for PCOS women.

      "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality associated with diabetes, which is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. Low-carbohydrate diet has gained popularity as an intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, acting to improve glycemic profile and serum lipids. In its turn, exercise in hypoxia induces specific adaptations, mostly modulated via hypoxia-induced transcription factor signaling cascade, which increases with exposure to altitude, and promotes angiogenesis, glycogen supply, glucose tolerance, and raises GLUT-4 expression. Aim: Given that hyperglycemia decreases HIF-1α and it is better controlled when following a low-carbohydrate diet, this study aims to examine the hypothesis that a combination of both low-carbohydrate diet and chronic exercise in hypoxia in type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with improved glycemic control and cardiovascular parameters, whose protocol is described. Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 48) will be recruited and randomized into one of the three groups: (a) Control group: Control diet (low-fat and moderate-carbohydrate diet) + exercise in normoxia; (2) exercise in hypoxia group: Control diet + exercise in hypoxia; (3) intervention group: Low-carbohydrate diet (low-carbohydrate and high-fat diet) + exercise in hypoxia. Before and after 8 weeks of interventions, cardiopulmonary tests (Bruce protocol), body composition and blood pressure will be evaluated. Blood samples will be collected to measure hypoxia-induced transcription factor, C-reactive protein, glycemic and lipid profiles. Summary: This will be the first trial to examine the isolated and combined effect of chronic exercise in hypoxia and low-carbohydrate diet in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This trial will help to fill a significant research gap, guide future research and contribute to the combined nutrition and exercise approach to type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Optimal carbohydrate intake is an important and controversial area in the nutritional management of type 2 diabetes. Some evidence indicates that reducing overall carbohydrate intake with a low- or very low-carbohydrate eating plan can improve glycemic control compared to following eating plans that involve greater carbohydrate intake. However, critical knowledge gaps currently prevent clear recommendations about carbohydrate intake levels. METHODS: The LEGEND (Lifestyle Education about Nutrition for Diabetes) Trial aims to compare a very low-carbohydrate diet to a moderate-carbohydrate plate-method diet for glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. This two-site trial plans to recruit 180 adults with type 2 diabetes. We will randomize participants to either a 20-session group-based diet and lifestyle intervention that teaches either a very low-carbohydrate diet or a moderate-carbohydrate plate-method diet. We will assess participants at study entry and 4 and 12 months later. The primary outcome is HbA1c, and secondary outcomes include inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein), body weight, changes in diabetes medications, lipids (small particle LDL, HDL, triglycerides), skeletal metabolism (bone mineral density from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and bone turnover markers serum procollagen type I N propeptide and serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen), and body composition (percent body fat, percent lean body mass). DISCUSSION: The LEGEND trial is a randomized controlled trial to assess optimal carbohydrate intake in type 2 diabetes by evaluating the effects of a very low-carbohydrate diet vs. a moderate-carbohydrate plate-method diet over a year-long period. The research addresses important gaps in the evidence base for the nutritional management of type 2 diabetes by providing data on potential benefits and adverse effects of different levels of carbohydrate intake.

This study compared the effects of a healthcare professional delivered LC diet compared to habitual diets higher in carbohydrates on clinical outcomes in adults with T1D. Twenty adults (18-70 yrs) with T1D (≥6 months duration) with suboptimal glycaemic control (HbA1c>7.0% or >53 mmol/mol) participated in a 16-week single arm within-participant, controlled intervention study involving a 4-week control period following their habitual diets (>150 g/day of carbohydrates) and a 12-week intervention period following a LC diet (25-75 g/day of carbohydrates) delivered remotely by a registered dietitian. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c -primary outcome), time in range (blood glucose: 3.5-10.0 mmol/L), frequency of hypoglycaemia (<3.5 mmol/L), total daily insulin, and quality of life were assessed before and after the control and intervention periods. Sixteen participants completed the study. During the intervention period, there were reductions in total dietary carbohydrate intake (214 to 63 g/day; P<0.001), HbA1c (7.7 to 7.1% or 61 to 54 mmol/mol; P = 0.003) and total daily insulin use (65 to 49 U/day; P<0.001), increased time spent in range (59 to 74%; P<0.001), and improved quality of life (P = 0.015), with no significant changes observed during the control period. Frequency of hypoglycaemia episodes did not differ across timepoints, and no episodes of ketoacidosis or other adverse events were reported during the intervention period. These preliminary findings suggest that a professionally supported LC diet may lead to improvements in markers of blood glucose control and quality of life with reduced exogenous insulin requirements and no evidence of increased hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis risk in adults with T1D. Given the potential benefits of this intervention, larger, longer-term randomised controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

Although its effect on glucose control has been confirmed in previous clinical trials, most of those studies have focused on comparing calorie-restricted LCD to iso-caloric low-fat diets. In this study, we aim to compare the effects of LCD and canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in patients with T2DM. METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. We will recruit 120 patients with poor-controlled T2DM. Participants will be randomly divided into canagliflozin and LCD groups in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the change in hemoglobin A1C levels after the 3-month intervention. The secondary outcomes are the time in range and cost of antihyperglycemic agents. Exploratory outcomes include physical examination, body composition, glucose variability, appetite, glycolipid metabolism, liver lipid content, and urine glucose threshold. DISCUSSION: No previous study has compared an LCD with antihyperglycemic agents. In LoCaT, participants' metabolism will be assessed from multiple perspectives. It is believed that the finding obtained from this trial will optimize the treatments for patients with T2DM. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1900027592.

We examined weight loss, glucose and lipid metabolism, and intestinal flora in obese individuals when compared with individuals on a reduced staple food low carbohydrate diet. METHODS: From inclusion and exclusion criteria, 99 participants (28 kg/m2 ≤ body mass index (BMI) ≤ 35 kg/m2) were recruited and randomly assigned to control and intervention 1 and 2 groups. Physical examinations and biochemical indices were performed/gathered before the intervention and at 4 and 13 weeks post intervention. After 13 weeks, feces was collected and 16s rDNA sequenced. RESULTS: After 13 weeks, when compared with controls, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure values in intervention group 1 were significantly reduced. In intervention group 2, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and hip circumference were significantly reduced. Triglyceride (TG) levels in both intervention groups were significantly reduced. Fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, glycosylated albumin, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels in intervention group 1 were decreased, while high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) decreased slightly. Glycosylated albumin, TG, and total cholesterol levels in intervention group 2 decreased, while HDL-c decreased slightly, High sensitive C-reactive protein, MPO, Ox-LDL, LEP, TGF-β1, IL-6, GPLD1, pro NT, GPC-4, and LPS levels in both intervention groups were lower when compared with controls. Adiponectin (ADPN) levels in intervention groups were higher when compared with controls. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in intervention group 1 were lower when compared with controls. There is no obvious difference in α diversity and β diversity between intestinal flora of 3 groups. Among the first 10 species of Phylum, only the control group and the intervention group 2 had significantly higher Patescibacteria than the intervention group 1. Among the first 10 species of Genus, only the number of Agathobacter in intervention group 2 was significantly higher than that in control group and intervention group 1. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that an LCD, where nutritional protein powder replaced some staple foods and dietary fiber and fish oil were simultaneously supplemented, significantly reduced weight and improved carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in obese individuals when compared with an LCD which reduced staple food intake."

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: In a prospective intervention clinical trial, adolescents with T1DM using a continuous glucose monitoring device were enrolled. Following a cooking workshop, each participant received a personalized diet regime based on LCD (50-80 g carbohydrate/day). A Food Frequency Questionnaire was administered, and laboratory tests were taken before and 6 months following the intervention. Twenty participants were enrolled. RESULTS: The median age was 17 years (15; 19), and the median diabetes duration was 10 years (8; 12). During the six-months intervention, carbohydrate intake decreased from 266 g (204; 316) to 87 g (68; 95) (p = 0.004). Energy intake, the energy percent from ultra-processed food, and fiber intake decreased (p = 0.001, p = 0.024, and p < 0.0001, respectively). These changes were accompanied by declines in BMI z-score (p = 0.019) and waist-circumference percentile (p = 0.007). Improvement was observed in the median HbA1c from 8.1% (7.5; 9.4) to 7.7% (6.9; 8.2) (p = 0.021). Significant declines below the DRI were shown in median intake levels of iron, calcium, vitamin B1, and folate. CONCLUSIONS: The LCD lowered ultra-processed food consumption, BMI z-scores and the indices of central obesity.

To ensure the accuracy of the study, all test meals were provided, and compliance was checked using a smartphone app. Body composition measurements and blood tests were performed before and after the 2-month dietary intervention. The results showed that both methods significantly reduced body weight and fat, and also improved lipid abnormalities and liver function. In the current study, the reductions in weight and fat were comparable. The results of a questionnaire at the end of the study indicated that the LCD was easier to carry out than the VLCD, suggesting that the LCD was sustainable.

From January to March 2021, 23 obese adult women (n = 23) with an average age of 35.30 years and BMI of 33.96 kg/m2 followed a KD. Instructions for the KD were given to eligible participants, with a typical plan and a menu for all the main meals, snacks, and drinks permitted over seven days. They were also free to change meals according to their preferences provided that they followed the plan. The participants attended six times throughout the intervention for measurements of their anthropometric indices, BHB levels, interleukin-1beta (1L-1β) levels, and completion of a questionnaire (pre-intervention, mid-intervention, and post-intervention). Following the KD caused significant weight loss, a reduction in waist circumference and BHB levels, as well as a reduction in BMI and appetite. Cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased slightly. However, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in serum increased significantly (p < 0.05), and 1L-1β decreased significantly (p < 0.0001). The results show that the KD effectively encouraged weight loss and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Recently, pemafibrate and a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) have each been reported to improve fatty liver disease. However, it is unclear whether their combination improves fatty liver disease and is equally effective in obese and non-obese patients. METHODS: In 38 metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) patients, classified by baseline body mass index (BMI), changes in laboratory values, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) were studied after 1 year of combined pemafibrate plus mild LCD. RESULTS: The combination treatment resulted in weight loss (P = 0.002), improvement in hepatobiliary enzymes (γ-glutamyl transferase, P = 0.027; aspartate aminotransferase, P < 0.001; alanine transaminase [ALT], P < 0.001), and improvement in liver fibrosis markers (FIB-4 index, P = 0.032; 7 s domain of type IV collagen, P = 0.002; M2BPGi, P < 0.001). Vibration-controlled transient elastography improved from 8.8 to 6.9 kPa (P < 0.001) and MRE improved from 3.1 to 2.8 kPa (P = 0.017) in the liver stiffness. MRI-PDFF improved from 16.6% to 12.3% in liver steatosis (P = 0.007). In patients with a BMI of 25 or higher, improvements of ALT (r = 0.659, P < 0.001) and MRI-PDFF (r = 0.784, P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with weight loss. However, in patients with a BMI below 25, the improvements of ALT or PDFF were not accompanied by weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with pemafibrate and a low-carbohydrate diet resulted in weight loss and improvements in ALT, MRE, and MRI-PDFF in MAFLD patients. Although such improvements were associated with weight loss in obese patients, the improvements were observed irrespective of weight loss in non-obese patients, indicating this combination can be effective both in obese and non-obese MAFLD patients.",

Our objetive is to assess whether a low carbohydrate diet can increase total serum testosterone and improve erectile function in hypogonadal men with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: An open label randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing a low carbohydrate diet and controls, during three months, in hypogonadal men with metabolic syndrome. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated as well as total serum testosterone levels, and symptoms of hypogonadism, using the ADAM and AMS scores, and sexual function using IIEF-5 score. RESULTS: Eighteen men were evaluated. Anthropometric measures were improved only in low carbohydrate diet group. The intervention group also had a statistically increase in IIEF-5 score and a significant reduction in AMS and ADAM scores (p < 0.001). The increase in serum total testosterone levels was statistically significant in the low carbohydrate group compared to the control group as well as calculated free testosterone (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low carbohydrate diet may increase serum levels of testosterone and improve erectile function in hypogonadal men with metabolic syndrome. However, larger studies are necessary to strongly prove the effectiveness of low carbohydrate diet in treating male hypogonadism.",

Depression and anxiety are known as mental disorders which are highly prevalent worldwide. Previous studies have shown different results. This diet has attracted enormous interest. OBJECTIVE: This is the first meta-analysis conducted to review systematically all trials to evaluating the effect of a low carbohydrate diet (LCD) on depression, and anxiety. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus have been searched until 9 September 2021. In total, 8 RCTs (n = 590) were carried out for evaluation the effects of LCDs on depression and anxiety were included. All the trials included in the analyses evaluated patients without a mood disorder. Random model effects meta-analysis was conducted. To evaluate the heterogeneity among the included studies. The egger test was used. Subgroup analyses performed based on regions, assessment methods, carbohydrate intake and duration of studies. RESULTS: This study did not show any significant association between a low carbohydrate diet and the of anxiety (SMD = 0.19, 95 % CI -0.10, 0.47; P = 0.20) and also depression (SMD = 0.06, 95 % CI -0.11, 0.24; P = 0.49). If one of the studies is excluded, this diet significantly increases anxiety (SMD = 0.33, 95 % CI 0.12, 0.54; P ≤ 0.001). This study showed that this diet increases anxiety in studies with <26 % carbohydrate intake (SMD = 0.31; 95%CI 0.10, 0.52; P ≤ 0.001; I2 = 0.00, P = 0.52), in the Australia (SMD = 0.29; 95%CI 0.08, 0.49; P = 0.01; I2 = 0.00, P = 0.42), and in studies that used the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) to assess anxiety (SMD = 0.33; 95%CI 0.11, 0.54; P ≤ 0.001; I2 = 0.00, P = 0.54). LIMITATIONS: One of the limitations of intervention studies examining the effect of diet is that it is difficult to blind people under intervention. CONCLUSION: The present study did not demonstrate significant association between a low carbohydrate diet and improvement of depression and anxiety. More accurate studies are needed to reach definitive conclusions.",

Through systematic analysis of multidomain datasets, we find that dietary adherence and diet quality, not just caloric restriction, are important for short-term weight loss in both diets. Interestingly, we observe minimal dietary differences between those who succeeded in long-term weight loss and those who did not. Instead, proteomic and gut microbiota signatures significantly differ between these two groups at baseline. Moreover, the baseline respiratory quotient may suggest a specific diet for better weight-loss outcomes. Overall, the identification of these dietary, molecular, and metabolic factors, common or unique to the HLC and HLF diets, provides a roadmap for developing individualized weight-loss strategies.",

Therefore, we conducted a randomized trial to determine the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD), an 8-h time-restricted eating (TRE) schedule, and their combination on body weight and abdominal fat area (i.e., primary outcomes) and cardiometabolic outcomes in participants with MetS. Compared with baseline, all 3-month treatments significantly reduce body weight and subcutaneous fat area, but only TRE and combination treatment reduce visceral fat area (VFA), fasting blood glucose, uric acid (UA), and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, compared with changes of LCD, TRE and combination treatment further decrease body weight and VFA, while only combination treatment yields more benefits on glycemic control, UA, and dyslipidemia. In conclusion, without change of physical activity, an 8-h TRE with or without LCD can serve as an effective treatment for MetS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04475822).",

METHODS: Participants were from a prospective mother-offspring cohort study in Wuhan, China. LCD score was calculated according to the percentage of dietary energy intake from carbohydrate, protein, and fat assessed in late pregnancy using validated food frequency questionnaires. Allergic diseases, including immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic diseases, allergic contact dermatitis, and food allergy, were recorded at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postpartum follow-up. Poisson regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 1636 mother-infant pairs included in the present analysis, 230 infants (14.1%) with IgE-mediated allergic diseases, 77 (4.7%) with allergic contact dermatitis, and 488 (29.8%) with food allergy were, respectively, reported. Independent of total energy intake and other potential confounders, both the lowest quintile (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.13-2.77) and the highest quintile (RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.22-2.63), were associated with the risk of IgE-mediated allergic diseases compared with the middle quintile. Among high-carbohydrate-diet pregnant women, substituting 5% of energy from either protein or fat for carbohydrate was associated with a lower risk of IgE-mediated allergic diseases. While among low-carbohydrate-diet pregnant women, substituting 5% of energy from carbohydrate, especially high-quality carbohydrate, for fat was associated with a lower risk of IgE-mediated allergic diseases. CONCLUSION: Maternal low carbohydrate-high protein and fat, and high carbohydrate-low protein and fat diet were both associated with an increased risk of allergic diseases in the infants up to 2 years. This study may provide an intervention strategy for allergy prevention in early childhood.",

The aim of this review is to summarize the results of current randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of low fat diet (LFD) vs. low carbohydrate diet (LCD) on NAFLD. This is a systematic review of all the available data reported in published clinical trials up to February 2022. The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed, and data were presented aiming specific standard measurements. A total of 15 clinical trial studies were included in this systematic review. There is an overall lack of consensus on which dietary intervention is the most beneficial for NAFLD patients. There is also an overall lack of consensus on the definition of the different restrictive diets and the percentage of macronutrient restriction recommended. It seems that low calorie diets, regardless of their fat and carbohydrate composition, are efficient for liver enzyme reduction. Both LCD and LFD have similar effects on liver enzymes change; however, this improvement tends to be more marked in LFD. All calorie restrictive dietary interventions are beneficial for reducing weight, liver fat content and liver enzymes in individuals with NAFLD. Low fat diets seem to be markedly successful in reducing transaminase levels. Further research is needed to explore diet intensity, duration and long-term outcome."

The cardiac storage of limit dextrin causes a form of cardiomyopathy similar to primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Treatment with a high fat diet is controversial but we report a positive outcome in a child with cardiomyopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-year-old boy with GSDIIIa developed left ventricular hypertrophy at 4.3 years of age. A high-fat (50%), high protein (20%), low-carbohydrates (30%) diet was introduced. After 18 months, echocardiogram, biochemical and clinical parameters improved (Creatine Kinase (CK), 1628➔1125 U/L; left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), 35➔20 mmHg; interventricular septum (IVS), 21➔10 mm). The diet was abandoned for 2 years resulting in reversal of symptoms, but recommencement showed improvement after 6 months. CONCLUSION: A high fat, high protein and low carbohydrate diet was successful in reversing cardiomyopathy. This form of treatment should be considered in children with GSD IIIa with cardiomyopathy."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At an academic center, we randomized 39 patients with T1DM aged 13-21 years to one of three 12-week interventions: an LCD, an isocaloric standard carbohydrate diet (SCD), or general diabetes education without a prescriptive diet. Glycemic outcomes included glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and continuous glucose monitoring. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in glycemic, lipidemic, or QOL parameters between groups at any timepoint. Median HbA1c was similar at baseline between groups and did not change appreciably (7.9%-8.4% in LCDs, 7.9%-7.9% in SCDs, and 8.2%-7.8% in controls). Change in carbohydrate consumption was minimal with only one participant reaching target carbohydrate intake. CONCLUSIONS: This pragmatic LCD intervention did not alter carbohydrate consumption or glycemia. Although this study was unable to evaluate a highly controlled LCD, it indicates that adolescents are unlikely to implement an educational LCD intervention in routine clinic settings. Thus, this approach is unlikely to effectively mitigate hyperglycemia in adolescents.",

There is no study evaluating the combined effect of circuit training exercise (CTE) and dietary intervention (low-carbohydrate [LC] diet) among young males with obesity. METHODS: A randomized control trial was conducted to explore the effects of a combined program of CTE and a LC diet for adults with mild or moderate obesity. Seventy adults with obesity were allocated randomly into 2 groups. The experimental group (group 1) received circuit training with LC diet intervention, whereas the control (group 2) received only circuit training. The study variables such as exercise capacity, body composition, and cardiometabolic indices were measured at the baseline and the end of 60 days of intervention. RESULTS: The participants of group 1 showed significant improvements in body composition (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, waist hip circumference, and body fat percentage), exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption), and cardiometabolic indices (high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and total cholesterol) with a P < .05 for all the variables, when compared with group 2. CONCLUSIONS: The combined structured CTE with controlled LC diet intervention in obese adults caused significant reduction in body composition and cardiometabolic indices variables and an increase in exercise capacity.",

METHODS: This single-group, pre-post, mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) study was conducted in an outpatient tertiary hospital. Eligible participants were those aged ≥18 years, with type 1 diabetes for ≥1 year, and using multiple daily insulin injections. Participants followed a 12-week individualized LCD (<100 g/d). Daily glucose levels were monitored using a continuous glucose monitor. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and QoL were measured preintervention and postintervention. A post-hoc exploratory regression analysis determined whether changes in carbohydrate intake was associated with changes in HbA1c and QoL. Qualitative data collected postintervention explored participants' perceptions relating to a LCD, glycemic control, and QoL. RESULTS: Participants (n = 22) completed the 12-week LCD intervention. An LCD provided a statistically, significant improvement in HbA1c 0.83% (95% CI 0.32%-1.33%), P = .003 but did not impact QoL: estimated change 1.14 units (95% CI: -5.34 to 7.61); P = .72. The post-hoc exploratory regression analysis showed that participants with poorer baseline glycemic control were more likely to respond to an LCD resulting in significant reductions in HbA1c. Participant perceptions relating to the study variables were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: An LCD (<100 g/d) is a potentially effective and safe strategy to improve glycemic control without negatively effecting QoL in Australian adults with type 1 diabetes.",

We have assessed the value of LDL-C as a CVD risk factor, as well as effects of the LCD on other CVD risk factors. We have also reviewed findings that provide guidance as to whether statin therapy would be beneficial for individuals with high LDL-C on an LCD. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple longitudinal trials have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the LCD, while also providing evidence of improvements in the most reliable CVD risk factors. Recent findings have also confirmed how ineffective LDL-C is in predicting CVD risk. SUMMARY: Extensive research has demonstrated the efficacy of the LCD to improve the most robust CVD risk factors, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. Our review of the literature indicates that statin therapy for both primary and secondary prevention of CVD is not warranted for individuals on an LCD with elevated LDL-C who have achieved a low triglyceride/HDL ratio.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a 4-week LCD with or without exercise on anxiety and eating behavior, and to explore the associations between changes in the psychological state and physiological parameters (i.e., body composition, aerobic fitness, blood pressure, lipid profile, and metabolic hormones). METHODS: Seventy-four overweight Chinese women [age: 20.8 ± 3.0 years, body mass index (BMI): 25.3 ± 3.3 kg·m-2] completed the 4-week randomized controlled trial, which included a LCD group (i.e., ~50 g daily carbohydrate intake) with exercise training 5 days/week (LC-EXE, n = 26), a LCD group without exercise training (LC-CON, n = 25) and a control group that did not modify their habitual diets and physical activity (CON, n = 23). Levels of anxiety, eating behavior scores and physiological parameters (i.e., body weight, V̇O2peak, blood pressure, fasting glucose, blood lipids, and serum metabolic hormones including insulin, C-peptide, leptin, and ghrelin) were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in anxiety levels in the LC-EXE compared with the LC-CON group, while no statistical changes were found in eating behaviors in any conditions after the 4-week intervention. Significant reduction in weight (~3.0 kg or 4%, p < 0.01) and decreases in insulin (~30% p < 0.01), C-peptide (~20% p < 0.01), and leptin (~40%, p < 0.01) were found in both LC-CON and LC-EXE groups, but adding exercise to a LCD regime generated no additional effects. There were significant improvements in V̇O2peak (~15% p < 0.01) and anxiety (~25% p < 0.01) in the LC-EXE compared with the LC-CON group, while no statistical differences were found between CON and LC-CON treatments. Further analysis revealed a negative association (r = -0.32, p < 0.01) between changes in levels of anxiety and changes in V̇O2peak in all participates, no other correlations were found between changes in psychological and physiological parameters. CONCLUSION: Although the combination of a LCD and exercise may not induce additional reductions in body weight in overweight young females, exercise could be a useful add-on treatment along with a LCD to improve cardiometabolic health and lower anxiety levels."

In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the association between adherence to low carbohydrate diet (LCD) score and serum lipids, glycemic markers, blood pressure, and anthropometric parameters among obese individuals. The current cross-sectional study is a combination of two projects with total participants of 359 obese individuals (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m2 ) aged 20-50 years were included. Dietary intake was assessed by a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) of 132 food items. Low carbohydrate diet score was estimated by deciles of dietary intakes. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III). Enzymatic methods were used to assess serum lipids, glucose, and insulin concentrations. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometer and body composition with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Higher adherence to LCD score was associated with significantly lower DBP and triglyceride (TG) concentrations and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C levels after adjustment for the confounders (p < 0.05). A non-significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and total cholesterol (TC) values were also observed. Also, high adherence to LCD score was associated with reduced prevalence of metabolic syndrome (p < 0.05). Higher BMI, fat mass, and lower fat-free mass were also accompanied with higher adherence to LCD score. According to our study, low carbohydrate diet score was associated with more favorable cardio-metabolic risk factors independent of some confounders like age, BMI, sex, and physical activity level. Further studies in different communities will help for generalization of our findings.",

Although the association between LCD and serum levels of leptin and adiponectin has been studied extensively, the results were not consistent. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the effect of LCD on serum levels of leptin and adiponectin. DESIGN: Electronic databases were retrieved in PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science to search relevant publications. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by the random-effect model. Cochrane Q test and I2 statistic were used to test heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were applied to assess possible sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of thirty-five articles were included in final analysis. Meta-analysis results revealed no statistical association between LCD and adiponectin concentration (WMD: 0.32 ng/ml, 95% CI: - 0.02, 0.66, p=0.062). Subgroup analysis showed that LCD increased adiponectin concentration in subjects under 45 years old and in studies with long term duration intervention. Also, did not observe a significant effect from the LCD on serum concentration of leptin (WMD: - 0.77 ng/ml, 95% CI: -3.15, 1.61, P=0.409). Subgroup analysis did not show any new information. The results of this study did not support the evidence for the positive effects of LCD on serum leptin and adiponectin levels."

METHODS: Fifty overweight/obese Chinese females (age 22.2 ± 3.3 years, body mass index 25.1 ± 3.1 kg/m-2) were randomized to the groups of LC, LC and HIIT (LC-HIIT, 10 repetitions of 6-s sprints and 9-s rest), and LC and MICT group (LC-MICT, cycling at 50-60% V̇O2peak for 30 min). The LC-HIIT and LC-MICT experienced 20 training sessions over 4 weeks. RESULTS: The 4-week LC intervention with/without additional training failed to change the Shannon, Chao 1, and Simpson indexes (p > 0.05), LC increased Phascolarctobacterium genus, and LC-HIIT reduced Bifidobacterium genus after intervention (p < 0.05). Groups with extra exercise training increased short-chain fatty acid-producing Blautia genus (p < 0.05) and reduced type 2 diabetes-related genus Alistipes (p < 0.05) compared to LC. Sutterella (r = -0.335) and Enterobacter (r = 0.334) were associated with changes in body composition (p < 0.05). Changes in Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, and Roseburia genera were positively associated with blood pressure (BP) changes (r = 0.392-0.445, p < 0.05), whereas the changes in Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Parabacteroides genera were negatively associated with BP changes (r = -0.567 to -0.362, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LC intervention did not change the α-diversity and overall structure of gut microbiota. Combining LC with exercise training may have additional benefits on gut physiology. Specific microbial genera were associated with LC- and exercise-induced regulation of cardiometabolic health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggest that gut microbiota may impact urologic health including prostate cancer (PC), potentially via affecting intestinal permeability (IP). Studies have indicated that disrupted IP may be improved by healthy diets and weight loss. In the Carbohydrate and Prostate Study 2 (CAPS2) clinical trial, which showed that a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) reduced weight significantly in men with PC and suggestively slowed PC disease progression, we explored the impact of LCD on an IP marker, zonulin and an inflammation marker, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). METHODS: CAPS2 was a 6-month randomized controlled trial testing a LCD intervention vs. control on PC progression using prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) as the marker. All 45 participants had prior primary PC treatment, PSADT >3 and <36 months, and body mass index (BMI) ≥24 kg/m2. RESULTS: At 6-month, zonulin decreased in the LCD arm (median -8.3%, IQR -16.6, 0.3%) while the control increased slightly (median 1.4%, IQR -3.0, 13.3%; p = .014). No changes were observed in hsCRP. Linear regression models showed that weight change was significantly associated with log(PSADT) such that the greater the weight loss, the longer the PSADT(p = .003). There was a similar inverse trend between change in zonulin and log(PSADT) (p = .050). Nevertheless, the mediation analysis showed that zonulin was not a significant intermediary mechanism of the effect of weight change on PSADT (p = .3). CONCLUSION: Future studies are merited to examine further the potential association of IP with inflammation and to clarify if improvement in IP is associated with decreased PC progression.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systemic treatments for prostate cancer (PC) have significant side effects. Thus, newer alternatives with fewer side effects are urgently needed. Animal and human studies suggest the therapeutic potential of low carbohydrate diet (LCD) for PC. To test this possibility, Carbohydrate and Prostate Study 2 (CAPS2) trial was conducted in PC patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after local treatment to determine the effect of a 6-month LCD intervention vs. usual care control on PC growth as measured by PSA doubling time (PSADT). We previously reported the LCD intervention led to significant weight loss, higher HDL, and lower triglycerides and HbA1c with a suggested longer PSADT. However, the metabolic basis of these effects are unknown. METHODS: To identify the potential metabolic basis of effects of LCD on PSADT, serum metabolomic analysis was performed using baseline, month 3, and month 6 banked sera to identify the metabolites significantly altered by LCD and that correlated with varying PSADT. RESULTS: LCD increased the serum levels of ketone bodies, glycine and hydroxyisocaproic acid. Reciprocally, LCD reduced the serum levels of alanine, cytidine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and 2-oxobutanoate. As high ADMA level is shown to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) signaling and contribute to various cardiovascular diseases, the ADMA repression under LCD may contribute to the LCD-associated health benefit. Regression analysis of the PSADT revealed a correlation between longer PSADT with higher level of 2-hydroxybutyric acids, ketone bodies, citrate and malate. Longer PSADT was also associated with LCD reduced nicotinamide, fructose-1, 6-biphosphate (FBP) and 2-oxobutanoate. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a potential association of ketogenesis and TCA metabolites with slower PC growth and conversely glycolysis with faster PC growth. The link of high ketone bodies with longer PSADT supports future studies of ketogenic diets to slow PC growth.",

Dietary modification is an essential component of T2D management. Evidence suggests that a low carbohydrate diet (LCD) provides better clinical outcomes for people with T2D compared with other diets. However, providing dietary support in face-to-face settings is challenged by issues of availability and accessibility. Provided in conjunction with standard care, digital interventions can help bridge this gap. The objective of this paper is to describe the protocol of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a web-based intervention that will evaluate the effectiveness of standard care plus web-based LCD intervention when compared with standard care only. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a two-arm parallel RCT, 100 adults with non-insulin-dependent T2D aged between 40 and 89 years will be randomised to either a theoretically informed 16-week automated web-based LCD intervention plus standard care or standard care only. LCD recommendations emphasise consuming nutrient-dense whole foods and encourage a daily carbohydrate goal of 50-100 g, with an objective of achieving 10% to <26% carbohydrates from total energy intake. Assessments will take place at baseline and 16 weeks. The primary outcome will be haemoglobin A1c. Additional data collected will include dietary intake, self-efficacy, weight and height, anti-diabetes medication and dosages, and diabetes-related comorbidities. Process evaluation will consist of a mixed-methods assessment of website engagement metrics, user experience and participants' perspectives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All study procedures have been approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2020-349). Study findings will be disseminated widely through public, professional and academic presentation and publication.

      "abstract": "With the renewed interest in low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) in the sports field, a few animal studies have investigated their potential. However, most rodent studies have used an LCD containing low protein, which does not recapitulate a human LCD, and the muscle-specific adaptation in response to an LCD remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of two types of LCDs, both containing the same proportion of protein as a regular diet (isonitrogenous LCD; INLCD), on body composition, exercise performance, and metabolic fuel selection at the genetic level in the skeletal muscles of exercise-trained mice. Three groups of mice (n = 8 in each group), one fed a regular AIN-93G diet served as the control, and the others fed either of the two INLCDs containing 20% protein and 10% carbohydrate (INLCD-10%) or 20% protein and 1% carbohydrate (INLCD-1%) had a regular exercise load (5 times/week) for 12 weeks. Body weight and muscle mass did not decrease in either of the INLCD-fed groups, and the muscle glycogen levels and endurance capacity did not differ among the three groups. Only in the mice fed INLCD-1% did the plasma ketone concentration significantly increase, and gene expression related to glucose utilization significantly declined in the muscles. Both INLCD-1% and INLCD-10% consumption increased gene expression related to lipid utilization. These results suggest that, although INLCD treatment did not affect endurance capacity, it helped maintain muscle mass and glycogen content regardless of the glucose intake restrictions in trained mice. Moreover, an INLCD containing a low carbohydrate content might present an advantage by increasing lipid oxidation without ketosis and suppressing muscle glucose utilization.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multiple studies have confirmed that diet restrictions can effectively realize glycemic control and reduce metabolic risks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In 2018, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) stated that individuals can select a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) according to their needs and preferences. Owing to the influence of Chinese traditional eating habits, only a small portion of patients in China have achieved their blood glucose goals. As a result, the Chinese government will incur huge expenditures. METHOD: This study recruited 134 T2DM participants and randomly assigned them to the LCD group (n = 67) or the low-fat diet (LFD) group (n = 67). All of the patients had a fixed amount of exercise and were guided by clinicians. After a period of dietary washout, all of the patients received corresponding dietary education according to group. The follow-up time was 6 months. The indicators for anthropometry, glycemic control, and medication application parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There were 121 participants who finally entered the study. The proportions of calories from three major nutrients the participants consumed met the requirements of LCD and LFD. Compared with baseline, the pre-postdifferences of body weight, BMI, and several other indicators were significant except for dosages of insulin used in the LCD group and MES in the LFD group. After the intervention, body weight, body weight index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial 2-h blood glucose (PPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in the LCD group decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared with the LFD group. The number of patients using lipid-lowering agents was significant higher in the LCD group and lower in the LFD group. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups for antihypertensive, hormone-replacement, and other agents. CONCLUSIONS: The LCD diet can decrease body weight, glycemic levels, MES, and lipid-lowering agents more than the LFD diet, thus decreasing cost burden in Chinese patients with T2DM. Strict diet control and monitoring are the keys to managing diabetes.",

Our goal was to map the frequency of LCD among children with T1D and to describe their clinical and laboratory data. METHODS: Caregivers of 1040 children with T1D from three centers were addressed with a structured questionnaire regarding the children's carbohydrate intake and experience with LCD (daily energy intake from carbohydrates below 26% of age-recommended values). The subjects currently on LCD were compared to a group of non-LCD respondents matched to age, T1D duration, sex, type and center of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 624/1040 (60%) of the subjects completed the survey. A total of 242/624 (39%) subjects reported experience with voluntary carbohydrate restriction with 36/624 (5.8%) subjects currently following the LCD. The LCD group had similar HbA1c (45 vs. 49.5, p = 0.11), lower average glycemia (7.0 vs. 7.9, p = 0.02), higher time in range (74 vs. 67%, p = 0.02), lower time in hyperglycemia >10 mmol/L (17 vs. 20%, p = 0.04), tendency to more time in hypoglycemia <3.9 mmol/L(8 vs. 5%, p = 0.05) and lower systolic blood pressure percentile (43 vs. 74, p = 0.03). The groups did not differ in their lipid profile nor in current body height, weight or BMI. The LCD was mostly initiated by the parents or the subjects themselves and only 39% of the families consulted their decision with the diabetologist. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low carbohydrate diet is not scarce in children with T1D and is associated with modestly better disease control. At the same time, caution should be applied as it showed a tendency toward more frequent hypoglycemia.",

Observational studies have demonstrated that type 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence increases as salt intake increases. We aimed to elucidate associations of total salt and its sources with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with T2DM. METHODS: We conducted an observational study using data from a 6-month moderate low-carbohydrate dietary intervention in 245 outpatients with T2DM (138 men) without antidiabetic medication. Intakes of total salt and its sources, carbohydrate and total energy were assessed at baseline and 6 months based on 3-day dietary records. Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine associations of Δtotal salt or its sources with ΔHbA1c. RESULTS: Salt intake significantly decreased in men (change: -0.92 ± 3.53 g/day) but not in women (0.11 ± 2.28). HbA1c (men: -1.5 ± 1.6%; women: -0.9 ± 1.3%), carbohydrate (men: -115 ± 104 g/day; women: -64 ± 71) and total energy (men: -439 ± 660 kcal/day; women: -192 ± 438) significantly decreased in both sexes. Multiple regression analysis revealed that reducing intakes of total salt and salt from salty snacks, meat processed foods, Chinese noodles with soup and table salt by 1.0 g was associated with decreases in HbA1c of 0.11% 1.18% 0.47% 0.38% and 0.26%, respectively, in men, while reducing salt from miso by 1.0 g was associated with a decrease in HbA1c of 0.30% in women. The associations were dependent on Δcarbohydrate or Δtotal energy in men, while the association of Δsalt from miso in women was independent of them. CONCLUSION: Reducing total salt and its sources had differential associations with HbA1c. Individual associations depended on Δcarbohydrate or Δtotal energy in men, while that of salt from miso in women was independent of them."

METHODS: Out of 289 apparently healthy obese adults who were chosen by a stratified multistage probability sampling method, 94 of them agreed to participate in the study. They were assigned to low carbohydrate and low fat diet groups. Both groups were followed up for 6 months and the data were taken at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months of intervention. Ninety-four obese adults completed the intervention. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare differences of metabolic dependent variables between the two independent variables, the low carbohydrate and low fat diet, at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months of intervention. RESULTS: The Participants in low carbohydrate diet group had greater decrease in the prevalence of MetS. At the baseline, according to the ATP III criteria, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 44.4% (24/54) in low carbohydrate diet group and 60% (24/40) in low fat diet group. The prevalence of MetS was decreased significantly to 16.7% (9/54) after 3 months and to 3.7% (2/54) after 6 months in low carbohydrate diet (p < 0.001). Moreover, the prevalence of MetS was decreased significantly to 32.5 (13/40) after 3 months and to 22.5% (9/40) after 6 months in low fat diet (p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found between low carbohydrate diet & low fat diet at the baseline (p-value = 0.136) and after 3 months and after 6 months of intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Both low carbohydrate diet and low fat diet have significant effects on reducing the prevalence of MetS in obese adults when followed up for 6 months. Compared to low fat diet, low carbohydrate diet had greater effect in reducing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Both diet programs were found to be effective in improving the metabolic state of obese adults.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is limited data on the effects of low carbohydrate diets on renal outcomes particularly in patients with underlying diabetic kidney disease. Therefore, this study determined the safety and effects of very low carbohydrate (VLCBD) in addition to low protein diet (LPD) on renal outcomes, anthropometric, metabolic and inflammatory parameters in patients with T2DM and underlying mild to moderate kidney disease (DKD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an investigator-initiated, single-center, randomized, controlled, clinical trial in patients with T2DM and DKD, comparing 12-weeks of low carbohydrate diet (<20g daily intake) versus standard low protein (0.8g/kg/day) and low salt diet. Patients in the VLCBD group underwent 2-weekly monitoring including their 3-day food diaries. In addition, Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was performed to estimate body fat percentages. RESULTS: The study population (n = 30) had a median age of 57 years old and a BMI of 30.68kg/m2. Both groups showed similar total calorie intake, i.e. 739.33 (IQR288.48) vs 789.92 (IQR522.4) kcal, by the end of the study. The VLCBD group showed significantly lower daily carbohydrate intake 27 (IQR25) g vs 89.33 (IQR77.4) g, p<0.001, significantly higher protein intake per day 44.08 (IQR21.98) g vs 29.63 (IQR16.35) g, p<0.05 and no difference in in daily fat intake. Both groups showed no worsening of serum creatinine at study end, with consistent declines in HbA1c (1.3(1.1) vs 0.7(1.25) %) and fasting blood glucose (1.5(3.37) vs 1.3(5.7) mmol/L). The VLCBD group showed significant reductions in total daily insulin dose (39(22) vs 0 IU, p<0.001), increased LDL-C and HDL-C, decline in IL-6 levels; with contrasting results in the control group. This was associated with significant weight reduction (-4.0(3.9) vs 0.2(4.2) kg, p = <0.001) and improvements in body fat percentages. WC was significantly reduced in the VLCBD group, even after adjustments to age, HbA1c, weight and creatinine changes. Both dietary interventions were well received with no reported adverse events. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that dietary intervention of very low carbohydrate diet in patients with underlying diabetic kidney disease was safe and associated with significant improvements in glycemic control, anthropometric measurements including weight, abdominal adiposity and IL-6. Renal outcomes remained unchanged. These findings would strengthen the importance of this dietary intervention as part of the management of patients with diabetic kidney disease.",

      "abstract": "To date, much progress has been made in dietary therapy for obese patients. A low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) has reached a revival in its clinical use during the past decade with undefined mechanisms and debatable efficacy. The gut microbiota has been suggested to promote energy harvesting. Here, we propose that the gut microbiota contributes to the inconsistent outcome under an LCD. To test this hypothesis, patients with obesity or patients who were overweight were randomly assigned to a normal diet (ND) or an LCD group with ad libitum energy intake for 12 weeks. Using matched sampling, the microbiome profile at baseline and end stage was examined. The relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, including Porphyromonadaceae Parabacteroides and Ruminococcaceae Oscillospira, was markedly increased after LCD intervention for 12 weeks. Moreover, within the LCD group, participants with a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides at baseline exhibited a better response to LCD intervention and achieved greater weight loss outcomes. Nevertheless, the adoption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction model greatly surpasses a general linear model in predicting weight loss outcomes after LCD intervention. Therefore, the gut microbiota served as a positive outcome predictor and has the potential to predict weight loss outcomes after short-term LCD intervention. Gut microbiota may help to guide the clinical application of short-term LCD intervention to develop effective weight loss strategies. (This study has been registered at the China Clinical Trial Registry under approval no. ChiCTR1800015156). IMPORTANCE Obesity and its related complications pose a serious threat to human health. Short-term low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) intervention without calorie restriction has a significant weight loss effect for overweight/obese people. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides is a positive outcome predictor of individual weight loss after short-term LCD intervention. Moreover, leveraging on these distinct gut microbial structures at baseline, we have established a prediction model based on the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm that could be used to estimate weight loss potential before each clinical trial (with Chinese patent number 2021104655623). This will help to guide the clinical application of short-term LCD intervention to improve weight loss strategies.",

      "abstract": "Background: The ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet, has gained in popularity in recent years, which is reflected by an increasing number of scientific articles, books, websites, and other publications related to low carbohydrate (LC) diets and KDs. Numerous preclinical studies in different animal models of cancer have examined the effect of KDs on cancer growth, but no large randomized controlled studies or prospective cohort studies are available for human cancer patients. Evidence supporting the use of KDs as an adjunct to traditional cancer therapy has come predominantly from anecdotes and case reports. The first KD clinical trials in patients with glioblastoma revealed good acceptance and a possible anti-tumor effect. Metabolic therapy options such as the KD are not yet part of the standard of care in cancer patients. However, many cancer patients have begun implementing a KD or LC diet on their own. The aim of the present study was to gather information, via an online questionnaire, about how cancer patients go about implementing a KD or LC diet, what resources they rely on, whether they perceive benefits from the diet on quality of life (QoL), and what factors influence feasibility and adherence to the diet. Method: Recruitment of participants was carried out via social media platforms, forums and cooperating physicians (April 2018 through November 2018). To be eligible for the study, participants had to be diagnosed with cancer and on a KD or LC diet at the time of participating in the study or been on a KD or LC diet during cancer treatment. Study participants were asked to fill out an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into four parts and contained a total of 64 questions. The questions were focused on the current health status of the participant, type of cancer, time since diagnosis, and treatment regimen. In addition, questions addressed social support, extent of professional counseling, food preferences and QoL. Results: A total of 96 participants (77 F, 17 M) submitted the questionnaire, of which 94 were included in the final data analysis. Ages ranged between 24 and 79 years (mean 50.1 ± 12.1 years). In 73.4% of the participants, the tumor had not formed metastases at the time of initial diagnosis. Twenty-four (26%) participants had a PET-positive tumor, 8 (9%) a PET-negative tumor, and the remainder (66.0%) did not report a PET scan. Eighty seven percent had undergone surgery in the course of their cancer treatment. The most frequent tumor type was breast cancer, followed by cervical cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Fifty nine percent of the study participants stated that they followed a KD during cancer therapy, 21% followed a low carbohydrate/high fat (LCHF) diet and 12% followed a low glycemic index (LOGI) diet. Sixty nine percent reported an improvement of QoL because of the diet. Almost half of the study participants sourced their initial information on KDs and LC diets from the internet. We found a significant correlation between weight loss upon implementation of a KD and the extent of overweight (p < 0.001). Weight loss in already lean participants was not reported. Overall, 67% of the participants found long-term adherence to the diet to be \"easy\" and 10.6% described it as being \"very easy.\" Participants who like fatty foods tended to perceive the diet as being easier to follow (p = 0.063). Conclusion: The KD or LC diet improved self-reported QoL in more than two-thirds of study participants. The KD had a normalizing effect on body weight. The majority of the participants rated the diet as easy or very easy to follow long term. There was an obvious gap between patients' desire for professional dietary counseling and what is currently offered by health care providers. In the future, efforts should be made to invest in nutrition experts who are trained in the KD to support cancer patients with implementation of a KD."

      "abstract": "Healthcare professionals in the primary care setting need to be competent to safely adapt diabetes medications when patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) alter their diet. Safe prescribing practice is supported through an understanding of the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of medications. This review article supports clinicians in the practical application of this knowledge to achieve safe practice. Traditional medical training and clinical practice for chronic disease has long revolved around the teaching of intensifying therapy and evidenced based prescribing, a crucial skill when chronic disease progresses. Now that we are witnessing remission of Type 2 Diabetes through nutritional interventions specifically low carbohydrate diets (LCD) we must apply the same effort and thought to de-prescribing as the underlying metabolic condition improves. There is minimal guidance in the literature on how to actively de-prescribe. The American Diabetes Association in their Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes-2021 acknowledges low carbohydrate nutritional therapy (LCD) as a viable option in the management of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Thus, the goal of our paper is to help close the gap between the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of T2D medications to the practical application and teamwork needed to facilitate safe medication reduction in the primary care setting when applied to a LCD. The LCD is an increasingly popular and effective option for managing T2D and can lead to an improvement in the condition, reduced medication burden, and contribute to significant weight loss. Safe initiation of a LCD in patients on medications requires significant monitoring and medication adjustments to decrease and eliminate the risk of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The health care team including clinicians in primary care, nursing, pharmacy and nutrition need to be competent in adjusting diabetes and antihypertensive medications to achieve safe and effective care. The most immediate and important adjustments are to insulin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors, blood pressure medications and diuretics. Interdisciplinary care teams can individualize therapy while following the guidance, which includes monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure closely, decreasing medications that can cause hypoglycaemia and hypotension, evaluating blood glucose and blood pressure data responses regularly, and open access communication with the team. The article is an international consensus document on de-prescribing that was put together by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians."

SETTING: Yazd Health Study and Taghzieh Mardom-e-Yazd study. PARTICIPANTS: Data of 2074 participants were used. Dietary intakes were assessed by a validated semi-quantitative FFQ. LCD score was calculated for each person by summing up the assigned scores to deciles of energy percentages from macronutrients. Mets was evaluated using National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Eventually, association between LCD score and Mets was examined using logistic regression. RESULTS: Total Mets prevalence was approximately 40·5 %. After adjustment for confounders, subjects in the higher quartile of LCD score had a significant lower chance of Mets than lower quartile among all participants (Q4 v. Q1: OR: 0·68, 95 % CI (0·50, 0·92)) and separately in men (Q4 v. Q1: OR: 0·54, 95 % CI (0·34, 0·86)) and women (Q2 v. Q1: OR: 0·53, 95 % CI (0·34, 0·82)). Furthermore, more LCD adherence in men reduced abdominal obesity by 47 % (Q3 v. Q1: OR: 0·53, 95 % CI (0·28, 0·99)). A significant inverse relation was also observed between low HDL cholesterol and LCD score in all participants (Q4 versus Q1 OR: 0·74, 95% CI: 0·56-0·99) and separately in men (Q4 versus Q1 OR: 0·63, 95% CI: 0·40-0·98). CONCLUSIONS: More adherence to LCD might be related to lower chance of Mets and some of its components such as low HDL-cholesterol and abdominal obesity specially in men. Further studies are required to confirm the findings.",

Therefore, we intended to evaluate the influence of a moderately low-carbohydrate diet on improving markers of metabolic syndrome among workers in Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants with metabolic syndrome or obesity were recruited based on the eligibility criteria for the Specific Health Guidance program and educated on a moderately low-carbohydrate diet between spring 2016 and fall 2018. The participants were then made to report their food intake and body weight once a week for the next 12 weeks and were counselled on maintaining a moderately low-carbohydrate diet. HbA1c levels, lipid profile, body weight, and sleep quality were evaluated. The normality of the data was evaluated using the Skewness/Kurtosis test. Each variable was compared before and after the intervention using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Further, a subgroup analysis of the data from the participants whose variables were abnormal at baseline was performed. RESULTS: Among the 101 enrolled participants, a decrease in the median weight (from 82.5 to 79.7 kg, p<0.001, n=46), body mass index (from 27.3 to 26.9 kg/m2, p<0.001, n=46), and apnea-hypopnea index (from 24.1 to 17.1, p<0.01, n=39) was observed. Subgroup analysis of participants with abnormal baseline values revealed changes in HbA1c (from 6.7% to 5.8%, p<0.001, n=34), total cholesterol (from 220 to 209 mg/dL, p<0.01, n=54), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 133 to 120 mg/dL, p<0.001, n=31), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 35 to 40 mg/dL, p<0.01, n=31), triglycerides (from 242 to 190 mg/dL, p<0.01, n=57), and deep sleep percentage (from 10.4% to 18.2%, p<0.05, n=7). CONCLUSION: A moderately low-carbohydrate diet may be considered a potential intervention for improving the markers of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes."

We show that ketone bodies profoundly impact human T-cell responses. CD4+ , CD8+ , and regulatory T-cell capacity were markedly enhanced, and T memory cell formation was augmented. RNAseq and functional metabolic analyses revealed a fundamental immunometabolic reprogramming in response to ketones favoring mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diets have been a central component of lifestyle modification for decades. The Low-Carbohydrate Diet (LCD), originally conceived as a treatment strategy for intractable epilepsy (due to its association with ketogenesis), became popular in the 1970s and since then has risen to prominence as a weight loss strategy. OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy, limitations and potential safety concerns of the LCD. DATA SOURCES: We performed a narrative review, based on relevant articles written in English from a Pubmed search, using the terms 'low carbohydrate diet and metabolic health'. RESULTS: Evidence supports the efficacy of the LCD in the short-term (up to 6-months) for reduction in fat mass and remission of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D). However, the longer-term efficacy of the LCD is disappointing, with diminishment of weight loss potential and metabolic benefits of the LCD beyond 6-months of its adoption. Furthermore, practical limitations of the LCD include the associated restriction of food choices that restrict the acceptability of the LCD for the individual, particularly over the longer term. There are also safety concerns of the LCD that stem from nutritional imbalances (with a relative excess of dietary fat and protein intake with associated dyslipidaemia and increased risk of insulin resistance and T2D development) and ketotic effects. Finally, the LCD often results in a reduction in dietary fibre intake, with potentially serious adverse consequences for overall health and the gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Although widely adopted, the LCD usually has short-lived metabolic benefits, with limited efficacy and practicality over the longer term. Dietary modification needs tailoring to the individual, with careful a priori assessments of food preferences to ensure acceptability and adherence over the longer term, with avoidance of dietary imbalances and optimization of dietary fibre intake (primarily from plant-based fruit and vegetables), and with a posteriori assessments of the highly individual responses to the LCD. Finally, we need to change our view of diets from simply an excipient for weight loss to an essential component of a healthy lifestyle.",

This study aimed to compare the change in plasma lipid concentrations during carbohydrate dietary changes in individuals with type 1 diabetes and identify links to early-stage dyslipidaemia. We hypothesized that (1) the lipidomic profiles after ingesting low or high carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks would be different; and (2) specific annotated lipid species could have significant associations with metabolic outcomes. METHODS: Ten adults with type 1 diabetes (mean ± SD: age 43.6 ± 13.8 years, diabetes duration 24.5 ± 13.4 years, BMI 24.9 ± 2.1 kg/m2, HbA1c 57.6 ± 2.6 mmol/mol) using insulin pumps participated in a randomized 2-period crossover study with a 12-week intervention period of low carbohydrate diet (< 100 g carbohydrates/day) or high carbohydrate diet (> 250 g carbohydrates/day), respectively, separated by a 12-week washout period. A large-scale non-targeted lipidomics was performed with mass spectrometry in fasting plasma samples obtained before and after each diet intervention. Longitudinal lipid levels were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: In total, 289 lipid species were identified from 14 major lipid classes. Comparing the two diets, 11 lipid species belonging to sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines and LPC(O-16:0) were changed. All the 11 lipid species were significantly elevated during low carbohydrate diet. Two lipid species were most differentiated between diets, namely SM(d36:1) (β ± SE: 1.44 ± 0.28, FDR = 0.010) and PC(P-36:4)/PC(O-36:5) (β ± SE: 1.34 ± 0.25, FDR = 0.009) species. Polyunsaturated PC(35:4) was inversely associated with BMI and positively associated with HDL cholesterol (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Lipidome-wide outcome analysis of a randomized crossover trial of individuals with type 1 diabetes following a low carbohydrate diet showed an increase in sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines which are thought to reduce dyslipidaemia. The polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine 35:4 was inversely associated with BMI and positively associated with HDL cholesterol (p < .001). Results from this study warrant for more investigation on the long-term effect of single lipid species in type 1 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: With the prevalence of diabetes worldwide, it is urgent to find a suitable treatment. Recently, the ketogenic diet has shown beneficial effects in reducing blood glucose, but some concerns have been raised about its probable side effects, such as hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Because a low-carbohydrate diet replaces part of the fat with carbohydrates on the basis of the ketogenic diet, we would like to know whether it does better in treating type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of a low-carbohydrate diet as a substitute for a ketogenic diet intervention in mice with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: C57 BL/6 J mice with type 2 diabetes, constructed by a high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin, were fed a standard diet, a high-fat diet, a low-carbohydrate diet, or a ketogenic diet for 14 wk, respectively. Then glucose and insulin tolerance tests were conducted. At the end of the study, blood and liver samples were collected and analyzed for serum biochemical indicators, histopathologic evaluation, hepatic lipid and glycogen content, and expression levels of mRNA and protein. RESULTS: Reduced blood glucose could be observed in both low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diets, as well as improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. However, the ketogenic diet decreased liver glycogen content and promoted gluconeogenesis. Mechanistically, this effect was due to inhibition of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase, which could be improved by a low-carbohydrate diet. Regarding lipid metabolism, the ketogenic diet increased lipid oxidation and reduced de novo lipogenesis, but the hepatic lipid content still inevitably increased. On the contrary, the low-carbohydrate diet reduced triacylglycerols and markers of liver damage. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that both diets are effective in lowering blood glucose, improving glucose tolerance, and raising insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the low-carbohydrate diet plays a role in inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and improving lipid metabolism. The results suggest that the two diets have different effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, and that the low-carbohydrate diet might have more benefits in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, 15 patients with T1D were assigned to the three dietary patterns for three separate weeks, with 7-day washout periods in between. Continuous glucose monitoring was applied during the intervention periods. The primary outcome was glycaemic control, as measured by the percentage of time patients spent within the euglycaemic range (TIR70-140   mg/dl ). Other key glycaemic metrics were also investigated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: TIR70-140 was not statistically different between HPD, MED and REF (p = .105). Pairwise analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between HPD and REF at the .05 level, which was not retained after applying Bonferroni correction (54.87% ± 14.11% vs. 48.33% ± 13.72%; p = .018). During the HPD period, 11 out of 15 participants spent more time within TIR70-140 compared with either the REF or MED. The HPD performed significantly better than the REF in terms of TIR70-180 (74.33% ± 12.85% vs. 67.53% ± 12.73%; p = .012), glycaemic variability (coefficient of variation: 36.18% ± 9.30% vs. 41.48% ± 8.69%; p = .016) and time spent in the hypoglycaemic range (TBR70   mg/dl ; median: 12, IQR: 16 vs. median: 14, IQR: 20; p = .007), whereas no statistically significant differences were observed between MED and HPD or REF. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with REF and MED, an HPD plan may have a positive impact on glycaemic control in patients with T1D. During the HPD, patients spent a shorter time in hypoglycaemia and exhibited lower glycaemic variability.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is rising. In 2020, a total of 124,652 Australians had T1DM. Maintaining optimal glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c ≤7.0%, ≤53 mmol/mol) on a standard carbohydrate diet can be a challenge for people living with T1DM. The Diabetes Complications and Control Trial established that macrovascular and microvascular complications could be reduced by improving glycemic control. Recent studies have found that a very low or low carbohydrate diet can improve glycemic control. However, the overall evidence relating to an association between a very low or low carbohydrate diet and glycemic control in people living with T1DM is both limited and mixed. In addition, research has suggested that a reduced quality of life due to anxiety and depression adversely influences glycemic control. Despite a potential link between a very low or low carbohydrate diet and optimal glycemic control, to our knowledge, no research has examined an association between a low carbohydrate diet, quality of life, and glycemic control, making this study unique in its approach. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to develop a validated diabetes-specific quality of life questionnaire for use in Australian adults with T1DM and to determine if an association exists between a low carbohydrate diet, quality of life, and glycemic control in Australian adults living with T1DM. METHODS: This cross-sectional study will be conducted in a tertiary hospital outpatient setting and will consist of 3 phases: phase 1, online Australian diabetes-specific quality of life questionnaire development and piloting (25-30 adults with T1DM); phase 2, questionnaire validation (364 adults with T1DM); and phase 3, a 12-week dietary intervention to determine if an association exists between a low carbohydrate diet, quality of life, and glycemic control in adults with T1DM (16-23 adults with T1DM). The validation of the study-developed Australian diabetes-specific quality of life questionnaire, and changes in hemoglobin A1c and quality of life in adults with T1DM while undertaking a low carbohydrate diet over 12 weeks will be the primary outcomes of this study. RESULTS: Phase 1 of the study is currently open for recruitment and has recruited 12 participants to date. It is anticipated that the first results will be submitted for publication in November 2021. Presently, no results are available. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind in that it will be the first to generate a new validated instrument, which could be used in evidence-based practice and research to understand the quality of life of Australian adults with T1DM. Second, the low carbohydrate dietary intervention outcomes could be used to inform clinicians about an alternative approach to assist T1DM adults in improving their quality of life and glycemic control. Finally, this study could warrant the development of an evidence-based low carbohydrate dietary guideline for adults living with T1DM with the potential to have a profound impact on this population.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between adherence of LCD and circadian rhythm mediated by inflammatory markers including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Galectin-3 in overweight and obese women. METHODS: 304 women affected by overweight and obesity were enrolled. We evaluated LCD scores by Semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) of 147 items. The morning-evening questionnaire (MEQ) was applied to evaluate the circadian rhythm. Biochemical parameters such as inflammatory markers and anthropometric components were assessed. RESULTS: There was a negative significant correlation between adherence of LCD and circadian rhythm status. In other words, as the LCD scores increased, the odds of circadian rhythm disturbance in intermediate group and morning type persons decreased compared to evening type. It was showed that, IL-1β and Galectin-3 in intermediate and morning type groups, destroyed the significance of this relationship and may be considered as mediating markers. CONCLUSION: Adherence of LCD can improve the circadian rhythm by reducing levels of inflammatory markers and may be considered as a treatment for obesity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A low-carbohydrate diet (LC) can be beneficial to obese subjects with type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) presents prompt glucose-lowering effects in subjects with T2DM. We investigated how LC and SGLT2i could similarly or differently influence on the metabolic changes, including glucose, lipid, and ketone metabolism in lean insulinopenic Akita mice. We also examined the impacts of the combination. METHODS: Male Akita mice were fed ad libitum normal-carbohydrate diet (NC) as a control or low-carbohydrate diet (LC) as an intervention for 8 weeks with or without SGLT2i treatment. Body weight and casual bold glucose levels were monitored during the study, in addition to measuring TG, NEFA, and ketone levels. We quantified gene expressions involved in gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism and ketogenesis in the liver and the kidney. We also investigated the immunostaining analysis of pancreatic islets to assess the effect of islet protection. RESULTS: Both LC and SGLT2i treatment reduced chronic hyperglycemia. Moreover, the combination therapy additionally ameliorated glycemic levels and preserved the islet morphology in part. LC but not SGLT2i increased body weight accompanied by epididymal fat accumulation. In contrast, SGLT2i, not LC potentiated four-fold ketone production with higher ketogenic gene expression, in comparison with the non-treated Akita mice. Besides, the combination did not enhance further ketone production compared to the SGLT2i alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that both LC and SGLT2i reduced chronic hyperglycemia, and the combination presented synergistic favorable effects concomitantly with amelioration of islet morphology, while the combination did not enhance further ketosis in Akita mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is preventable; however, few patients with prediabetes participate in prevention programs. The use of user-friendly continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) with low-carbohydrate diet coaching is a novel strategy to prevent T2DM. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the patient satisfaction and feasibility of an intervention combining CGM use and low-carbohydrate diet coaching in patients with prediabetes to drive dietary behavior change. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods, single-arm pilot and feasibility study at a suburban family medicine clinic. A total of 15 adults with prediabetes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels between 5.7% and 6.4% and a BMI >30 kg/m2 were recruited to participate. The intervention and assessments took place during 3 in-person study visits and 2 qualitative phone interviews (3 weeks and 6 months after the intervention). During visit 1, participants were asked to wear a CGM and complete a food intake and craving log for 10 days. During visit 2, the food intake and craving log along with the CGM results of the participants were reviewed and the participants received low-carbohydrate diet coaching, including learning about carbohydrates and personalized feedback. A second CGM sensor, with the ability to scan and record glucose trends, was placed, and the participants logged their food intake and cravings as they attempted to reduce their total carbohydrate intake (<100 g/day). During visit 3, the participants reviewed their CGM and log data. The primary outcome was satisfaction with the use of CGM and low-carbohydrate diet. The secondary outcomes included feasibility, weight, and HbA1c change, and percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia. Changes in attitudes and risk perception of developing diabetes were also assessed. RESULTS: The overall satisfaction rate of our intervention was 93%. The intervention induced a weight reduction of 1.4 lb (P=.02) and a reduction of HbA1c levels by 0.71% (P<.001) since enrollment. Although not significantly, the percentage of time above glucose goal and average daily glucose levels decreased slightly during the study period. Qualitative interview themes indicated no major barriers to CGM use; the acceptance of a low-carbohydrate diet; and that CGMs helped to visualize the impact of carbohydrates on the body, driving dietary changes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CGMs and low-carbohydrate diet coaching to drive dietary changes in patients with prediabetes is feasible and acceptable to patients. This novel method merits further exploration, as the preliminary data indicate that combining CGM use with low-carbohydrate diet coaching drives dietary changes, which may ultimately prevent T2DM."

Low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) reduces the glucose levels needed to drive the Warburg effect. METHODS: To investigate LCD's effect on GB therapy, we have begun a clinical trial using LCD as an addition to intranasal perillyl alcohol (POH) for recurrent GB (rGB) patients. This study involved 29 individuals and evaluated, over a period of 1 year, the adjuvant effect of LCD associated with POH therapy in terms of toxicity, extent of peritumoral edema, reduced corticosteroid use, seizure frequency, and overall survival. POH group (n = 14) received solely intranasal POH without specific diet regimen, whereas POH/LCD group (n = 15) received intranasal POH in combination with nutritional intervention. Patients' assessment was based on clinical reviews and magnetic resonance data. RESULTS: In the 1-year follow-up, the POH/LCD group showed a 4.4-fold decrease in the proportion of patients who needed treatment with corticosteroids, as well as a reduction in tumor size and peritumoral edema, as compared to the POH group. While 75% of patients undergoing POH treatment experienced seizures, this fraction was reduced to 56% in the POH/LCD group. A 2.07-fold increase in the proportion of patients with stable disease, along with a 2.8-fold decrease in the proportion of patients with TP, was seen in the POH/LCD group. CONCLUSION: The results presented in this study show that the LCD associated with intranasal POH therapy may represent a viable option as adjunctive therapy for rGB to improve survival without compromising patients' quality of life. Prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings and validate the efficacy of this novel therapeutic strategy."

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with a factorial design was performed on sixty-four overweight/obese women with PCOS. Participants were randomly allocated to four groups (n = 16 per group) as follows: 1) hypocaloric standardize diet + fennel (2 capsule/day) (HSDF), 2) hypocaloric high-protein diet + fennel (2 capsule/day) (HHPF), 3) hypocaloric standardize diet + placebo (HSDP), and 4) hypocaloric high-protein diet + placebo (HHPP). RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 28.54 (6.80) years and body mass index was 32.24 (4.65) kg/m2. At the end of intervention, protein intake was 20.43 % in the groups that received a high-protein diet versus 16.37 % in the standard diet groups (P < 0.001). Combination of hypocaloric high-protein diet and fennel capsule did not significantly affect change in outcomes compared with groups not receiving them. There was a significant interaction between hypocaloric high-protein diet and fennel on weight (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: A hypocaloric high-protein diet along with fennel supplementation could not provide additional improvements in anthropometric and androgen indices among PCOS women. Further studies are required to more precisely elucidate these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alow carbohydrate diet (LCD) is more beneficial for the glycometabolism in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and may be effective in reducing depression. Almond, which is a common nut, has been shown to effectively improve hyperglycemia and depression symptoms. This study aimed to determine the effect of an almond-based LCD (a-LCD) on depression and glycometabolism, as well as gut microbiota and fasting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in patients with T2DM. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial which compared an a-LCD with a low-fat diet (LFD). Forty-five participants with T2DM at a diabetes club and the Endocrine Division of the First and Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between December 2018 to December 2019 completed each dietary intervention for 3 months, including 22 in the a-LCD group and 23 in the LFD group. The indicators for depression and biochemical indicators including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), gut microbiota, and GLP-1 concentration were assessed at the baseline and third month and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A-LCD significantly improved depression and HbA1c (p <0.01). Meanwhile, a-LCD significantly increased the short chain fatty acid (SCFAs)-producing bacteria Roseburia, Ruminococcus and Eubacterium. The GLP-1 concentration in the a-LCD group was higher than that in the LFD group (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A-LCD could exert a beneficial effect on depression and glycometabolism in patients with T2DM. We speculate that the role of a-LCD in improving depression in patients with T2DM may be associated with it stimulating the growth of SCFAs-producing bacteria, increasing SCFAs production and GPR43 activation, and further maintaining GLP-1 secretion. In future studies, the SCFAs and GPR43 activation should be further examined.",

This study aimed to assess whether a low-carbohydrate diet can outperform an isocaloric conventional diet for improving body composition and performance in a sample of twenty-six trained male road cyclists (previous experience in cyclosportive events, 7.6 ± 4.4 years; age, 26.9 ± 4.9 years; weekly training volume, 7.8 ± 2.9 hours; height, 176 ± 7 centimeters; body fat percentage, 9.7 ± 0.8 %; weight, 65.3 ± 2.3 kg). Detraining and pretreatment periods in which nutrition and training were standardized were followed by an eight-week long intervention in which cyclists consumed either a low-carbohydrate diet (15 % of calories from carbohydrates) or a conventional endurance sports diet while maintaining the same training volumes and intensities. Body composition was assessed through electrical impedance, and performance was evaluated through a twenty-minute time trial performed on a smart bike trainer. The results revealed an overall improvement over time in absolute and relative power, body mass, and body fat for both groups, whilst the improvement in absolute power was comparable. The improvements seen in relative power (p = 0.042), body mass (p = 0.006), and body fat (p = 0.01) were significantly higher in the low-carbohydrate group.

However, their mechanisms of action differ, and the effects on the body remain unclear. We investigated the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor and LCD on body composition and metabolic profile using the db/db mouse model for obesity and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight-week-old male db/db mice were divided into four groups: mice receiving normal diet and vehicle or canagliflozin (Cana) administration and mice receiving LCD and vehicle or Cana administration for 8 weeks. Consumed calories were adjusted to be equal among the groups. RESULTS: Both Cana administration and LCD feeding resulted in significant weight gain. Cana administration significantly decreased plasma glucose levels and increased plasma insulin levels with preservation of pancreatic β cells. However, LCD feeding did not improve plasma glucose levels but deteriorated insulin sensitivity. LCD feeding significantly reduced liver weight and hepatic triglyceride content; these effects were not observed with Cana administration. Combined treatment with LCD did not lead to an additive increase in blood β-ketone levels. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2 inhibitors and LCD exert differential effects on the body. Their combined use may achieve better metabolic improvements in obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance and accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) place aging adults with obesity at high risk of cardio-metabolic disease. A very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD) may be a means of promoting fat loss from the visceral cavity and skeletal muscle, without compromising lean mass, and improve insulin sensitivity in aging adults with obesity. OBJECTIVE: To determine if a VLCD promotes a greater loss of fat (total, visceral and intermuscular), preserves lean mass, and improves insulin sensitivity compared to a standard CHO-based/low-fat diet (LFD) in older adults with obesity. DESIGN: Thirty-four men and women aged 60-75 years with obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30-40 kg/m2) were randomized to a diet prescription of either a VLCD (< 10:25:> 65% energy from CHO:protein:fat) or LFD diet (55:25:20) for 8 weeks. Body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), fat distribution by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), insulin sensitivity by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, and lipids by a fasting blood draw were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: Participants lost an average of 9.7 and 2.0% in total fat following the VLCD and LFD, respectively (p < 0.01). The VLCD group experienced ~ 3-fold greater loss in VAT compared to the LFD group (- 22.8% vs - 1.0%, p < 0.001) and a greater decrease in thigh-IMAT (- 24.4% vs - 1.0%, p < 0.01). The VLCD group also had significantly greater thigh skeletal muscle (SM) at 8 weeks following adjustment for change in total fat mass. Finally, the VLCD had greater increases in insulin sensitivity and HDL-C and decreases in fasting insulin and triglycerides compared to the LFD group. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss resulting from consumption of a diet lower in CHO and higher in fat may be beneficial for older adults with obesity by depleting adipose tissue depots most strongly implicated in poor metabolic and functional outcomes and by improving insulin sensitivity and the lipid profile.

      "abstract": "Obesity impairs both macro- and microvascular endothelial function due to decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide. Current evidence on the effect of low-carbohydrate (LC) diet on endothelial function is conflicting and confounded by the provision of caloric restriction (CR). We tested the hypothesis that LC without CR diet, but not LC with CR diet, would improve macro- and microvascular endothelial function in women with obesity. Twenty-one healthy women with obesity (age: 33 ± 2 years, body mass index: 33.0 ± 0.6 kg/m2; mean ± SEM) were randomly assigned to receive either a LC diet (~10% carbohydrate calories) with CR (n = 12; 500 calorie/day deficit) or a LC diet without CR (n = 9) and completed the 6-week diet intervention. After the intervention, macrovascular endothelial function, measured as brachial artery flow-mediated dilation did not change (7.3 ± 0.9% to 8.0 ± 1.1%, p = 0.7). On the other hand, following the LC diet intervention, regardless of CR, blocking nitric oxide production decreased microvascular endothelial function, measured by arteriolar flow-induced dilation (p ≤ 0.02 for both diets) and the magnitude was more than baseline (p ≤ 0.04). These data suggest improved NO contributions following the intervention. In conclusion, a 6-week LC diet, regardless of CR, may improve microvascular, but not macrovascular endothelial function, via increasing bioavailability of nitric oxide in women with obesity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With the incredibly high incidence of Type 2 Diabetes in the current population of emergency department patients, it is critical for clinicians to understand the possible complications of the treatment of this disease. Medication like canagliflozin are more common to encounter on patient's home medication lists and clinicians should be aware of how these medications, alone or combined with dietary modifications, can result in significant pathology and even mortality if not appropriately treated. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a patient with type II diabetes mellitus who presented with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the setting of concurrent use of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, and strict adherence to a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet for weight control. DISCUSSION: Euglycemic ketoacidosis has previously been observed in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients following strict ketogenic diets, as well as in diabetic patients being treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: As more patients choose ketogenic diets for weight control and diabetes management, clinicians should be aware of this potentially life-threatening complication in patients concurrently taking SGLT-2 inhibitors."

      "abstract": "Objective Intragastric balloon (IGB) therapy is a low-invasion treatment for obesity. Recently, a low-carbohydrate diet has shown effectiveness for encouraging weight loss, but whether or not a low-carbohydrate diet improves the efficacy of IGB therapy remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the effectiveness of a low-carbohydrate diet compared with a calorie-restricted diet in combination with IGB therapy. Methods A prospective study was conducted on 51 patients who had undergone IGB therapy from October 2012 to December 2017. Overall, 31 of the 51 patients were included in this study (12-month assessment after IGB placement). These 31 cases consisted of 18 IGB plus low-carbohydrate diet and 13 IGB plus calorie-restricted diet. We compared the two groups with respect to body weight loss as outcomes. Results At 12 months after IGB placement, the body weight was significantly lower than that observed at baseline in both the IGB plus low-carbohydrate diet group (baseline 101.9±25.8 kg, 12 months 88.2±21.9 kg) (p<0.0001) and the IGB plus calorie-restricted diet group (baseline 103.5±17.0 kg, 12 months 89.1±6.2 kg) (p<0.005). The percentage of excess weight loss in the IGB plus low-carbohydrate diet group was slightly higher than that in the IGB plus calorie-restricted diet group, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups at 12 months after IGB placement (IGB plus low-carbohydrate 49.9±60.0%, IGB plus calorie-restricted diet 33.1±27.0%). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that both a low-carbohydrate diet and a calorie-restricted diet were effective interventions for weight reduction in combination with IGB therapy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 [SGLT2] inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with diabetes, particularly patients with established cardiovascular disease. Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis [euDKA], a complication of SGLT2 therapy, can be exacerbated by a low carbohydrate diet. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, taking an SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin 10 mg orally daily, presented to the emergency room with a 2-day history of nausea and chest pain. A week prior to presentation, he had started a ketogenic diet. He was initially admitted with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. On initial assessment in the emergency room, his cardiac enzymes were normal and there were no ischemic changes in his ECG. As there was concern for unstable angina, he underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a known total occlusion with collaterals and arteries with a non-obstructive disease without any evidence of acute plaque rupture. His baseline laboratory assessments revealed an elevated anion gap of 17, increased urinary and plasma ketones, and metabolic acidosis. His plasma glucose level was 84 mg/dL. The diagnosis of euDKA was made, and treatment with intravenous fluids and insulin was initiated. His chest pain and nausea subsequently resolved. CONCLUSION: We present a case of euDKA triggered by a ketogenic diet while on SGLT2 inhibitor therapy presenting as chest pain. The recognition of euDKA is important in the context of increased SGLT2 use for the management of cardiovascular risk for patients with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Low-carbohydrate (LC) diets are an effective method for treating obesity and reducing cardiometabolic risk. However, exposure to LC diets is associated with reductions in muscle mass and increased osteoporosis risk in obese individuals. The combination of exercise with a LC diet appears to attenuate muscle mass loss induced by LC diets alone, and to further improve cardiometabolic profile. However, evidence to date in obese individuals is limited. We assessed the effect of LC diet in combination with supervised exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors in obese individuals. Methods: Male and female participants in the experimental (EX-LC; structured supervised exercise program + low-carbohydrate meals; n = 33; 35.3 years) and control (EX-CO; structured supervised exercise program + standard dietary advice; n = 31; 34.2 years) conditions underwent measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), body fat, lean muscle mass (LMM), and cardiometabolic biomarkers before and after an 8 week intervention. Results: Participants in the EX-LC condition demonstrated greater improvements in VO2peak (p = 0.002) and fat mass index (FMI, p = 0.001) compared to the EX-CO condition. Achieving a ketogenic state (β-hydroxybutyrate, βHB ≥0.3 mmol/L) was associated with greater reductions in total body fat (p = 0.011), visceral adipose tissue (p = 0.025), FMI (p = 0.002) and C-reactive protein (CRP, p = 0.041) but also with greater reductions in LMM (p = 0.042). Conclusion: Short-term LC diet combined with prescribed exercise enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness and the cardiometabolic profile of obese individuals but was also associated with greater muscle mass loss compared to similar exercise training and standard dietary advice. The long-term effects of the LC diet should be further explored in future studies.",
