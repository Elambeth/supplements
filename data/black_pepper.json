      "abstract": "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (C. gloeosporioides) is widely distributed pathogen responsible for postharvest losses in fruits and vegetables. Black pepper essential oil (BPEO) has emerged as natural antifungal agent that effectively inhibits C. gloeosporioides growth. However, the precise mechanism remains incompletely understood. This research investigates the suppressive properties of BPEO nanoemulsion on C. gloeosporioides and its impact on the respiratory metabolism. Results indicated that 2 MIC BPEO nanoemulsion have the best antifungal effect. Mechanistically, 2 MIC BPEO nanoemulsion can better suppress key enzymes connected to the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, hence reducing the C. gloeosporioides respiration rate. The total respiratory rate decreased by 60.54%, after 2 MIC BPEO nanoemulsion treatment. In conclusion, the BPEO nanoemulsion effectively mitigates fungal proliferation and reproduction by downregulating relevant enzymes expression. However, it is necessary to further expand the research on the regulation mechanism of enzyme activity at gene and protein level."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a rich source of natural and bioactive components such as N-trans-feruloyltyramine (NFT). In this paper, we discuss the results of the subchronic toxicity and mutagenicity studies conducted to understand the potential for adverse effects if any, of Black Pepper Extract Preparation (BPE). METHODS: To evaluate mutagenicity, an Ames test was conducted with BPE in the presence and absence of S9 metabolic activation. Long-term safety was inferred through a 90-day subchronic toxicology study using adult rats. Dose levels were selected with expected human intake levels of NFT (120 mg/kg/day), with an acceptable safety factor, for preclinical safety and tolerability. Sprague Dawley rats were fed diets targeting dietary intakes (doses) of 0, 125, 350, or 700 mg/kg/day of BPE for 90 days, an NFT dose level equivalent to 68, 190, and 380 mg/kg/day. RESULTS: In vitro Ames test up to 5000 µg/plate with and without S9 metabolic activation showed no BPE-related increases in revertant colony numbers and was non-mutagenic. There were no BPE-related changes in viability, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, and organ weights. BPE dietary administration did not induce any treatment-related changes in hematology, clinical chemistry, other macroscopic or microscopic endpoints. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The highest dose tested with BPE (700 mg/kg/day) was the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) that revealed no adverse effects. Based on toxicological endpoints evaluated, this NOAEL for BPE corresponded to a human equivalent NFT dose level of 380 mg/kg/day, dependent upon a (∼50%) concentration of NFT in BPE.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance (AMR) represents a serious threat to public health and poses challenges in disease prevention and treatment despite various efforts to combat it. Evaluation of the in vitro antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of black pepper seeds (Piper nigrum L.) against two infectious pathogens: Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics and the Department of Microbiology of Mymensingh Medical College conducted the study from Octy 2022 to June 2023. The antibacterial activity of Aqueous black pepper seed extract (ABPE) was evaluated at different doses using disk diffusion and broth dilution methods. The extract was prepared using 10.0% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water as solvent. The commonly used antibiotic ciprofloxacin was used in the broth dilution method and the results were compared with those for aqueous extracts. To confirm a more precise range of antimicrobial susceptibility of the extracts, ABPE was used at seven different concentrations (100, 80, 60, 40, 20, 10 and 5 mg/mL). Selected concentrations were then used as needed. ABPE showed an inhibitory effect on the above bacteria at doses of 90 mg/ml and higher. The Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were 85 and 90 mg/ml ABPE, respectively. The MIC of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was currently 1μg/ml. The MIC of ciprofloxacin was lowest for the organisms tested compared to the MIC of ABPE. This work clearly demonstrates the antibacterial sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli to an aqueous extract of black pepper seeds.",

Natural compounds, which are alternative treatments, are widely used in cancer treatment. Piperine, an alkaloid compound from black pepper, exerts anticancer effects through the cell death signaling pathway. Autophagy and senescence signaling pathways are considered target signaling pathways for cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of piperine via autophagy and senescence signaling pathways in NB4 and MOLT-4 cells. The MTT assay results demonstrated that piperine significantly decreased the viability of NB4 and MOLT-4 cells. Piperine induced autophagy by increasing LC3, Beclin-1 and ULK1 and decreasing mTOR and NF-κB1 expression in NB4 and MOLT-4 cells. In addition, piperine increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase fluorescence intensity by increasing p21 and IL-6 expression while decreasing CDK2 expression in NB4 and MOLT-4 cells. In conclusion, our study provides additional information about the induction of autophagy and senescence by piperine in acute leukemia.",

      "abstract": "Sustainable management of the Amazon rainforest is fundamental for supporting life on earth because of its crucial role in sequestering carbon. One of the species grown in the forest is açaí (Euterpe oleracea), which is an important food and income source for its inhabitant. The acai seed, resulting from the processing of the fruit, is a solid organic residue, which has been an agent of undesirable environmental impacts such as natural landscape modifications, clogging sewers and water courses, eutrophication of surface waters. In this research, we evaluated the use of wood chips as a source of energy in a rustic oven to produce acai biochar so that family farmers carry out sustainable management of the residue and use biochar to improve soil quality and produce seedlings of native plants to regenerate degraded forests. The experiment was conducted in Pará, Brazil, Amazon region, using a randomized complete block design. A factorial treatment structure was implemented consisting of four biochar particle sizes (3, 5, 7, and 12 mm), 4 application rates (4, 8, 16, and 32 t ha-1), and a biochar-free control, with 5 replications. The results showed that the methodology for biochar production was easy to apply and low cost, allowing its use by family farmers. The combination of biochar rate and particle size affected soil properties and the development of black pepper seedlings in different ways. The soil properties affected were water retention capacity, moisture, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and arylsulphatase activity. The growth parameters of the affected black pepper seedlings were height and root system development.",

      "abstract": "Extensive research on medicinal herbs for bioactive compounds proposes that they could replace synthetic drugs, reducing side effects and economic burdens. Especially, interest in the synergistic benefits of natural products is increasing, implying that their combined use may enhance therapeutic effectiveness. This study aimed to explore the synergetic effects of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) extract on lung normal (MRC-5) and cancer (A549 and NCI-H292) cell lines. The turmeric extract (TM) only affected the lung cancer cell lines, but it had no impact on the MRC-5 cell line. On the other hand, the black pepper extract (BP) did not cause any damage to either the lung normal or cancer cell lines, even at concentrations of up to 400 µg/mL. Response surface methodology was used to predict the ideal synergistic concentrations (EC50) of TM and BP, which were found to be 48.5 and 241.7 µg/mL, respectively. Notably, the selected condition resulted in higher cytotoxicity compared to the exposure to TM alone, indicating a potent synergetic effect. The rate of curcumin degradation under this combined treatment was significantly decreased to 49.72 ± 5.00 nmol/h/µg for A549 cells and 47.53 ± 4.78 nmol/h/µg for NCI-H292 cells, respectively, as compared to curcumin alone. Taken together, this study confirmed the potent synergistic effect of TM and BP on lung cancer cell lines. Further research is required to identify their specific synergetic mechanisms. Our findings provide crucial foundational data on the synergistic effects of TM and BP."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: A tyrosine kinase receptor known as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the main tumour markers in many cancer types and also plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, which is a result of the auto-phosphorylations (kinase activity enhancement) that trigger signals involved in different cellular processes. Due to the discovery that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a cause of this kinase activity enhancement, so far, several inhibitors have been tested against EGFR, but the side effects of these inhibitors necessitate an urgent measure to come up with an inhibitor that will be more specific to the cancer cells and not affect self-cells. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 37 compounds derived from Piper nigrum against EGFR using computer-aided drug design. Based on molecular docking, induced-fit docking, calculation of free binding energy, pharmacokinetics, QSAR prediction, and MD simulation. We propose five (5) lead compounds (clarkinol A, isodihydrofutoquinol B, Burchellin, kadsurin B, and lancifolin C) as a novel inhibitor, with clarkinol A demonstrating the highest binding affinity (-7.304 kcal/mol) with EGFR when compared with the standard drug (erlotinib). They also showed significant moderation for parameters investigated for a good pharmacokinetic profile, with a reliable R2 coefficient value predicted using QSAR models. The MD simulation of clarkinol A was found to be stable within the EGFR binding pocket throughout the 75 ns simulation run time. The findings showed that clarkinol A derived from Piper nigrum is worth further investigation and consideration as a possible EGFR inhibitor for the treatment of lung cancer.

Oils were used in both normal and nanoparticles-loaded forms. Oxidative stress enzymes of worms were estimated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for treated worms was done. Both normal and nanoemulsion forms of both BPO and TTO stopped the adult motility [BPO 2.5 h (hrs), NBPO 1.5 h, TTO 3 h, NTTO 1.5 h] and induced a marked decrease in the oviposition. Post treatment, the egg development and hatching were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced. The damage of the egg shell, embryonal cessation and destruction of larvae occurred. Noticeable elevated antioxidant enzymes (catalase CAT, glutathione transferase GST and glutathione GSH) were found, while oxidative enzymes (lipid peroxidation LPO and nitric oxide synthase NOS) decreased. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for both oil-treated worms revealed anterior ends damage and several cuts associated with cuticular pores. The use of albendazole induced more or less anthelmintic and enzymatic activities with less morphological alterations of adults revealed by SEM. This study proved the marked anthelmintic potency of the BPO and TTO and their nanoemulsion forms against H. contortus rather than the widely used anthelmintic drugs."

      "abstract": "The current study aimed to investigate the influence of pin-to-plate atmospheric cold plasma treatment (ACP) on the microbial decontamination efficacy, physical (water activity, color, texture), and bioactive (total phenolic and anti-oxidant capacity, volatile oil profile) of three major spices cinnamon, black pepper, and fennel at three different voltages (170, 200, 230 V) and exposure time (5, 10, 15 min). The surface etching and oxidative reactions of cold plasma is anticipated to cause microbial decontamination of the spices. In accordance with this, the ACP treatment significantly reduced the yeast and mold count of cinnamon, black pepper, and fennel, resulting in 1.3 Log CFU/g, 1.1 Log CFU/g, and 1.0 Log CFU/g, respectively even at the lowest treatment at 170 V-5 min. While at the highest treatment of 230 V-15 min, complete decontamination in all the samples was observed due to the plasma-induced microbial cell disruption. The water activity of samples reduced post-treatment 0.69 ± 0.02 to 0.51 ± 0.03 for cinnamon, 0.61 ± 0.03 to 0.49 ± 0.01 for pepper, and 0.60 ± 0.02 to 0.43 ± 0.02 for fennel which further reassures better microbial stability. The color and textural properties were significantly unaffected (p > 0.05) preserving the fresh-like attributes. The total phenolic content was increased for cinnamon (2.26 %), black pepper (0.11 %), and fennel (0.33 %) after plasma treatment at 230 V-15 min due to the cold plasma surface etching phenomenon. However, the essential oil composition revealed no significant variation in all three spices' control and treated samples. Thus, the study proves the potential of the atmospheric pressure cold plasma for the complete decontamination of the investigated spices (cinnamon, pepper, fennel) without remarkable changes in the volatile oil profile.",

Currently, bulk foods are treated with radiofrequency; potential cross-contamination may occur during packaging of pasteurized products. As an alternative, in-package RF processing was evaluated for Salmonella inactivation on black peppercorns and dried basil leaves and prevention of cross-contamination during storage postprocessing. In-package steaming refers to the process in which the samples were heated in a steam vent package to generate and retain steam during the treatment. This treatment achieved good heating uniformity which could be because of the circulation of steam within the package. One-way steam vent allowed the release of excess steam once a threshold pressure was achieved and later returned to its original position to seal the package, when the RF energy was removed. In-package RF steaming of black peppercorns and dried basil leaves for 135 s and 40 s, respectively, resulted in more than 5 log reduction of Salmonella. The steam vent remained stable posttreatment and properly sealed the package to protect the product from any external contamination. These results indicate that the use of steam vent could effectively pasteurize black peppercorns and dried basil leaves could be beneficial in preventing the potential cross-contamination postprocessing.",

Piperine is an alkaloid component in black pepper with a unique chemopreventive activity against oxidative stress-related damage in healthy tissues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of piperine on intestinal damage. METHODS: In this study, mice were divided into eight groups: including the control, piperine (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg), radiation (6 Gy), and piperine+radiation (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg + 6 Gy) groups. The radioprotective effects of piperine were evaluated by biochemical (MDA, GSH, and PC) and histopathological assessments in colon tissues. RESULTS: The 10 mg/kg dose of piperine significantly reduced the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers compared to the group that received only radiation. In addition, pre-treatment with 10 mg/kg piperine diminished the histopathological changes like vascular congestion in the submucosa, while the dose of 50 mg/kg led to the infiltration of inflammatory cells. CONCLUSION: Based on this study, it is concluded that piperine, at low dose, with its antioxidant properties, could reduce the colon damage caused by radiation.",

      "abstract": "Elimination of chemically synthesized pesticides, such as fungicides and nematicides, in agricultural products is a key to successful practice of the Vietnamese agriculture. We describe here the route for developing successful biostimulants based on members of the Bacillus subtilis species complex. A number of endospore-forming Gram-positive bacterial strains with antagonistic action against plant pathogens were isolated from Vietnamese crop plants. Based on their draft genome sequence, thirty of them were assigned to the Bacillus subtilis species complex. Most of them were assigned to the species Bacillus velezensis. Whole genome sequencing of strains BT2.4 and BP1.2A corroborated their close relatedness to B. velezensis FZB42, the model strain for Gram-positive plant growth-promoting bacteria. Genome mining revealed that at least 15 natural product biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) are well conserved in all B. velezensis strains. In total, 36 different BGCs were identified in the genomes of the strains representing B. velezensis, B. subtilis, Bacillus tequilensis, and Bacillus. altitudinis. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated the potential of the B. velezensis strains to enhance plant growth and to suppress phytopathogenic fungi and nematodes. Due to their promising potential to stimulate plant growth and to support plant health, the B. velezensis strains TL7 and S1 were selected as starting material for the development of novel biostimulants, and biocontrol agents efficient in protecting the important Vietnamese crop plants black pepper and coffee against phytopathogens. The results of the large-scale field trials performed in the Central Highlands in Vietnam corroborated that TL7 and S1 are efficient in stimulating plant growth and protecting plant health in large-scale applications. It was shown that treatment with both bioformulations resulted in prevention of the pathogenic pressure exerted by nematodes, fungi, and oomycetes, and increased harvest yield in coffee, and pepper."

      "abstract": "The shift in modern dietary regimens to \"Western style\" and sedentary lifestyles are believed to be partly responsible for the increase in the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. Natural products have been used throughout human history as treatments for a plethora of pathological conditions. Taurine and, more recently, black pepper have gained attention for their beneficial health effects while remaining non-toxic even when ingested in excess. Taurine, black pepper, and the major terpene constituents found in black pepper (i.e., β-caryophyllene; α-pinene; β-pinene; α-humulene; limonene; and sabinene) that are present in PhytoCann BP® have been shown to have cardioprotective effects based on anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-hypertensive and anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms. This comprehensive review of the literature focuses on determining whether the combination of taurine and black pepper extract is an effective natural treatment for reducing cardiovascular diseases risk factors (i.e., hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia) and for driving anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms to combat coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerotic disease.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a family of disorders that cause progressive structural and functional degeneration of neurons. Among all the organs in the body, the brain is the one that is the most affected by the production and accumulation of ROS. Various studies have shown that an increase in oxidative stress is a common pathophysiology for almost all NDs, which further affects various other pathways. The available drugs lack the wide spectrum necessary to confront these complexities altogether. Hence, a safe therapeutic approach to target multiple pathways is highly desirable. In the present study, the hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of Piper nigrum (black pepper), an important spice, were evaluated for their neuroprotective potential in hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). The extracts were also subjected to GC/MS to identify the important bioactives present. The extracts exhibited neuroprotection by significantly decreasing the oxidative stress and restoring the mitochondrial membrane potential in the cells. Additionally, the extracts displayed potent anti-glycation and significant anti-Aβ fibrilization activities. The extracts were competitive inhibitors of AChE. The multitarget neuroprotective mechanism displayed by Piper nigrum indicates it as a potential candidate in the treatment of NDs."

Additionally, inactivation mechanisms were analyzed to investigate the differences between pulsed and continuous SHS treatments. SHS at 250 °C and 300 °C for 1 min achieved more than a 3 log reduction, whereas SHS at 200 °C for 1 min achieved less than 2 log reduction in the number of endospores. In addition, higher microbicidal effects were confirmed with pulsed SHS treatment with a shorter duty ratio. To elucidate the inactivation mechanisms, inner membrane damage (dipicolinic acid release), intracellular enzyme activities, and DNA integrity were measured after 300 °C SHS pulsed or continuous treatments. After pulsed SHS treatment for up to 20 s, intracellular enzymes were inactivated more rapidly than after continuous treatment, and more DPA was released after 40 s of treatment, indicating that enzyme inactivation occurred prior to inner membrane damage, and pulsed treatment accelerated this mode of action. DNA integrity was significantly lower after 60 s of pulsed or continuous treatment; however, there was no difference in between pulsed and continuous treatments. Our results provide fundamental insights for the sterilization of black pepper by SHS treatment in food industries.",

Existing treatments for tobacco use disorder are limited in efficacy and there is a strong need for identifying effective novel treatments. Small clinical trials indicate that black pepper (Piper nigrum) essential oil may be helpful for treating nicotine withdrawal and craving. However, we are unaware of any cases reporting the use of black pepper for these purposes in nonresearch settings. Here we present the case of a patient who inhaled combusted black pepper to self-medicate nicotine withdrawal when lacking access to tobacco cigarettes while incarcerated. Based on our patient's report, inhalation of combusted black pepper may have alleviated his tobacco withdrawal and cravings by reducing his automatic motor urge to smoke, quelling withdrawal-associated anxiety, and mimicking the sensorimotor experience of smoking tobacco cigarettes. Notably, our patient reported that inhalation of combusted black pepper for treatment of nicotine craving and withdrawal was common in his correctional facility. Though combusted black pepper is highly unlikely to be an appealing treatment outside of a correctional setting, this case suggests that further investigation of vaporized black pepper essential oil for tobacco cessation may be warranted."

      "abstract": "The active compounds isolated from Black pepper have anticancer effects, but the bioactivity of Black pepper essential oil (BP-EO) is rarely studied. BP-EO has poor stability and a suitable dose form should be prepared for in vivo delivery. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has attracted more and more attention due to its high mitotic index, high metastasis rate and poor prognosis. In this study, the composition of BP-EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with BP-EO were prepared by nanoprecipitation method using Eudragit L100 as a carrier. We investigated the preparation, characterization, stability and in vitro release of nanoparticles. MTT assay, cell wound healing, Transwell invasion assay and Western blot were used to study the anti-tumor effect and mechanism of MDA-MB-231 cells. The GC-MS analysis identified a total of 33 compounds among which alkenes account for 63.55%. The prepared BP-EO NPs exhibited nanoscale morphology, good stability and pH-responsive and sustained release character which is suitable for in vivo delivery. BP-EO NPs significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, BP-EO NPs significantly inhibited the expressions of Wnt and β-catenin and significantly activated the expression of GSK-3β in MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, BP-EO NPs prepared in this study provide a new effective strategy for the treatment of TNBC. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Black pepper is rich in essential oil and has excellent antioxidant and antibacterial activities. However, the anti-tumor activity of BP-EO has not been studied. In this study, we found that BP-EO has excellent anticancer activity. To achieve effective encapsulation of black pepper essential oil and an excellent anti-triple negative breast cancer activity, nanoparticles loaded with BP-EO were prepared using Eudragit L100 as the carrier by the nanoprecipitation method. The in vitro study revealed that BP-EO NPs inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells via inhibiting the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. This study provides new ideas and innovations for the treatment of invasive triple negative breast cancer in the future. At the same time, we will further reveal the application potential, pharmacokinetic characteristics and precise mechanism of BP-EO NPs in vivo in subsequent studies.",

Thermal inactivation kinetics data is necessary to develop a pasteurization process for fine ground black pepper. This study investigates the influence of temperature and water activity on thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella in fine ground black pepper. It also assesses the suitability of Enterococcus faecium as a surrogate for Salmonella. Fine ground black pepper of varying water activities, aw (0.40, 0.55, 0.70) was subjected to isothermal treatments at different temperatures (65-80 °C) for five equidistant time points with intervals ranging from 18 s to 250 min. The survival data were used to fit two primary models (log-linear and Weibull) and two secondary models (response surface and Modified Bigelow). Results indicated that among the two primary models, the Weibull model explained the thermal inactivation kinetics better with lower RMSE (0.24 - 0.56 log CFU/g) and AICc values at all aw and temperatures. Water activity and treatment temperature significantly enhanced the thermal inactivation of Salmonella. E. faecium NRRL B-2354 was found to be a suitable surrogate for Salmonella in fine ground black pepper at all tested treatment conditions. The developed modified Bigelow model based on the Weibull model could be applied to predict the inactivation kinetics of Salmonella in black pepper and would benefit the spice industry in identifying process parameters for thermal pasteurization of fine ground black pepper.",

Here, we have investigated for the first time the therapeutic effects of a standardized Piper nigrum L., (black pepper) seed extract, ViphyllinTM in mitigating hyperglycemia and neuropathic pain of type 2 diabetes model rats. METHODS: Type 2 diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats using high fat diet and a single dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg i.p.). The diabetic rats were orally administered with Viphyllin containing not less than 30% β-caryophyllene (BCP), at 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg/kg/day doses for 6 weeks. Changes in body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), glucose tolerance, and blood biochemical parameters were measured. The nociceptive response to thermal stimulus (tail flick test) and sciatic nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were recorded at the end of study. RESULTS: Viphyllin treatment markedly improved the body weight and glucose tolerance in diabetic rats. Also, the extract could significantly reduce the diabetes-induced elevation in FBG, liver and kidney indices. Further, Viphyllin dose-dependently increased the nociception latency in tail flick test compared to untreated diabetic rats (p<0.05). Viphyllin at 100 mg/kg significantly increased the NCV (44.12±1.91*** m/s vs diabetic control 25.80±1.88 m/s). The antioxidant enzyme activities in sciatic nerve tissue were considerably increased in Viphyllin-treated groups compared to diabetic control. A 6-week treatment with Viphyllin markedly reversed the pathological manifestations of diabetes in vital organs such as liver, kidney and pancreas. CONCLUSION: The study concludes that Viphyllin exerts antidiabetic effects and improves nerve conduction to mitigate neuropathic pain."

Design: Prospective, case-control study. Methods: Fifty-six patients affected by diabetes mellitus type II were enrolled in the study. Twenty-eight patients with DME received 2 tablets/day, before meals of a dietary complementary supplement containing in fixed combination Curcumin (200 mg), Artemisia (80 mg), Bromelain (80 mg), and Black pepper (2 mg) (Intravit®, OFFHEALTH Spa, Firenze, Italy) for 6 months. Twenty-eight age-matched subjects affected by diabetes mellitus type II were given placebo and served as control group. Patients underwent best correct visual acuity (BCVA), swept optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT-Angiography (OCTA). OCTA images of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) were obtained for each eye. By the end of the follow-up patients were defined responder to the therapy when a decrease of more than 30 μm was registered in central retinal thickness (CRT) measurement, while a poor responder was determined by the absence of reduction or an increase in central retinal thickness at 6 months. We assessed the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, vessel density and quantified the number of microaneurysms in each layer. Results: A significant improvement of BCVA and CRT reduction was recorded at 6 months follow-up in the dietary complementary supplementation group compared to control (respectively p = 0.028 and p = 0.0003). VD of the total capillary plexus, microaneurysms count, glycaemia and HbA1c did not vary over the follow-up period between groups. Within the Intravit® group, poor responders tended to show a larger FAZ area, more microaneurysms, and a lower VD in the DCP compared to the good responders group (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: A fixed combination of Curcumin, Artemisia, Bromelain, and Black pepper oral administration may have a positive impact on central retinal thickness, visual acuity, and VD of the DCP in compensated type 2 diabetic patients with mild DME.",

Piper nigrum (black pepper) is one of the major culinary spices with medicinal attributes. METHODS: In the present study, the antinociceptive activity of a standardized black pepper seed extract (Viphyllin) containing not less than 30% β-caryophyllene (BCP) was evaluated using pain models in mice, namely acetic acid-induced writhing test, formalin-induced paw licking test, hot plate test and tail flick test. Further, the antagonists SR141716A (0.1 mg/kg i.p.), AM630 (5 mg/kg i.p.), capsazepine (0.1 mg/kg body weight i.p.), and GW6471 (1 mg/kg i.p.) were used to evaluate the involvement of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, TRPV1 ion channel and PPARα receptor, respectively. Molecular docking (AutoDock 4.2) was used to study the interaction of BCP with the agonist-binding sites of the selected pain receptors. RESULTS: Viphyllin at 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/kg (i.p.) significantly inhibited the writhings in mice as compared to untreated control group (p < 0.001). Further, Viphyllin at 50 mg/kg showed strong antinociceptive effect in formalin-induced paw licking test (p < 0.05). Pretreatment of mice with AM630 significantly reversed the antinociceptive activity of Viphyllin in both early and late phases of formalin test (p < 0.05). Administration of Viphyllin markedly increased the latency time of mice in hot plate test (p < 0.001). Further, Viphyllin markedly increased the latency time of tail flick compared to control group from 30 min to 90 min after treatment. AM630, Capsazepine, and GW6471 abolished the analgesic effect of Viphyllin. These findings clearly suggest the involvement of CB2 receptor, TRPV1 ion channel and PPARα receptor activation in Viphyllin-mediated antinociceptive activity. Docking score predictions further supported the possible involvement of BCP in the antinociceptive mechanism of Viphyllin. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Viphyllin could be a natural pain-relieving agent involving safer pain signaling mechanisms, unlike conventional opiates and NSAIDs."

      "abstract": "Natural foods with antioxidant properties, such as curcuma, papain, bromelain and black pepper, have been indicated as a potential natural therapeutic approach against osteoporosis. Zebrafish are an excellent animal model to study the effects of herbal preparations on osteogenesis and bone metabolism, both in physiological and in pathological conditions. Our study was aimed at evaluating whether curcuma-bromelain-papain-pepper herbal preparation (CHP) administered in embryos and adult fish is capable of promoting bone wellness in physiological and osteoporotic conditions. The effect of CHP has been studied in embryonic osteogenesis and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) in an adult fish model in which drug treatment induces a bone-loss phenotype in adult scales very similar to that which characterizes the bones of human patients. CHP prevented the onset of the osteoporotic phenotype in the scales of GIOP in adult zebrafish, with the osteoblastic and osteoclastic metabolic activity maintaining unaltered. CHP is also able to attenuate an already established GIOP phenotype, even if the alteration is in an advanced phase, partially restoring the normal balance of the bone markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and stimulating anabolic reparative processes. The results obtained indicated CHP as a potential integrative antioxidant therapy in human bone-loss diseases."

      "abstract": "The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of black pepper (BPE) and cinnamon bark (CE) extracts against E. fergusonii was assessed in pasteurized full cream milk during and post-fermentation. The milk was fermented with 1% (v/v) of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus (NCIMB 11778) and Streptococcus thermophilus (NCIMB 10387) (approx. 106 cfu/mL each) and incubated and stored at 25 °C for 5 days (144 h) or at 43 °C for 24 h and then stored at 25 °C for 120 h. The milk was spiked with E. fergusonii at the start of fermentation by the lactic acid bacteria (pre-fermentation contamination) for after fermentation (post fermentation contamination). BPE and CE were applied at concentrations based on their minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.5% and 0.25% respectively as follows: 0.5% BPE alone; 0.125% BPE with 0.1875% CE; 0.25% BPE with 0.125% CE; 0.375% BPE with 0.0625% CE; 0.25% CE alone. Results showed that during fermentation at 25 °C, E. fergusonii grew to a similar level (approx. 109 CFU/mL) in control samples and 108 CFU/mL when BPE or CE were added alone. Whereas, in the samples with the combined essential oils, the bacterium grew to 106-107 CFU/mL only. During the milk fermentation at 43 °C, E. fergusonii grew to approx. 109 CFU/mL in samples without treatment. However, it was not detected in samples containing mixed BPE with CE after 8, 10 and 12 h of fermentation. Subsequent storage at 25 °C resulted in undetectable levels of the bacterium in all the samples treated with BPE or CE after 24 h of storage. These results indicated that BPE in combination with CE reduced growth during fermentation and was bactericidal during storage."

      "abstract": "β-caryophyllene (BCP), a natural sesquiterpene present in plants, is a selective agonist of cannabinoid receptor type-2 (CB2) of the endocannabinoid system. In this study, we have prepared an extract from Piper nigrum (black pepper) seeds using supercritical fluid extraction, standardized to contain 30% BCP (ViphyllinTM ). The beneficial effects of prophylactic treatment with Viphyllin on cognitive functions were demonstrated in Scopolamine-induced dementia model mice. Male Swiss albino mice (25-30 g) were administered with Viphyllin (50 mg and 100 mg/kg body weight p.o.) or donepezil (1.60 mg/kg) for 14 days. Subsequently, cognitive deficits were induced by treating the animals intraperitoneally with Scopolamine (0.75 mg/kg). The cognitive behavior of mice was evaluated using a novel object recognition test (NORT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. The brain homogenates were studied for biochemical parameters including cholinesterase activities and antioxidant status. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the mechanism of action. Viphyllin dose dependently improved the recognition and spatial memory and cholinergic functions in Scop-treated mice. The extract was found protective against Scop-induced oxidative damage and histopathologic changes in the brain. At 100 mg/kg Viphyllin markedly reduced the proBDNF/mBDNF ratio (p < .05) and augmented the TrkB expression (p < .01). Viphyllin (100 mg/kg) was found to be neuroprotective by reducing the Scop-induced upregulation of p-JNK and p-p38 MAPK proteins, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and caspase activation in the brain. Viphyllin also exerted anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating Cox-2, TNF-α, and NOS-2 in Scop-induced mice (p < .05). To summarize, our data encourage Viphyllin as a functional ingredient/dietary supplement for brain health and cognition. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Black pepper is a culinary spice having several medicinal attributes. Essential oils in the seeds of the plant give aroma and flavor to it. Here we have prepared an extract from the seeds of black pepper using supercritical fluid extraction, characterized for the presence of β-caryophyllene (not <30%). This research work further validates the neuroprotective mechanism of the extract in Scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment model mice. The findings from this study strongly suggest the beneficial neuroactive properties of black pepper seed extract having the presence of BCP, a CB2 receptor agonist. It can thus be used potentially as a functional food ingredient for cognition and brain function.",

A novel method applying a treatments of Ozone Ultraviolet (UV, 255nm) and Infra-red (IR) light in different combinations was assessed for its efficiency in decontaminating OF and BP. In this study, untreated samples, as purchased, were inoculated with 9.5 × 105 cfu/mL Escherichia coli (MG1655) and exposed to each treatment alone and in combination of ozone sequentially followed by UV/IR, and UV/IR combined followed sequentially by ozone. A difference in response towards the treatment was shown among the types of spices, with a high efficacy for BP. Typically 3 log reductions were observed for ozone, UV and IR. The sequential treatments of ozone with UV and IR combined gave improved results than individual ones, with 99.99% of E. coli inactivation, and a shorter exposure duration with ozone (2.5 and 5 min) and UV and IR (2.5 and 5 min). The combined effect (ozone 2.5 min, UV and IR 10 min) yielded a log reduction of 2.69 and 4.20 for OF and BP respectively, greater than the additive effect of the individual treatments alone. The IR lamp was modulated to reduce excessive temperature rise. This novel prototype was shown to be very effective in decontaminating spices. Further studies should be conducted to validate the effectiveness of this method on decontamination of various bacterial strains."

The present study aims to investigate the binding affinity of the bioactive and synthetic compounds with the main protease (Mpro) enzymes and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) by computational approach. PASS prediction, pharmacokinetics, and toxicological properties prediction studies were performed through the Google PASS prediction and Swiss ADME/T website. Besides, molecular docking studies were accomplished by BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2020, UCSF Chimera, and PyRx autodock vina. RESULTS: The docking scores were inferred and the selected compounds showed results varying from -3.2 to -9.8 (kcal/mol). Theaflavin scored the highest docking score to the 5REB, 6VW1, and 1R42 enzymes and showed the binding affinity as -6.3 kcal/mol, -9.8 kcal/mol, and -8.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Again, kaempferol showed the best binding affinity to the 7BQY (-7.1 kcal/mol) and 6Y2FB (-6.6 kcal/mol) enzymes. All the chemical constituents showed better probability in action in pass prediction analysis. Besides, no ligands (except theaflavin) have any conflict with Lipinski's rules of five, which authorized the drug probability of these ligands. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the selected compounds could be considered a potential herbal treatment source against SARS-CoV-2."

Flumazenil, a competitive inhibitor of GABAA receptor in the benzodiazepine site and WAY-100635 maleate salt, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist were used to find out the possible mechanism(s) of action of PNEO. To exclude the false-positive results due to the enhancement of the locomotor activity, the animals were submitted to open field test (OFT). We also measured monoamines levels of the mice brain after acute PNEO treatment. The data obtained from the study suggest that the anxiolytics and antidepressant-like effect of PNEO have observed in EPM and TST respectively in a dose-dependent manner after oral acute and repetitive treatment. WAY-100635, but not flumazenil was able to reverse the effect of PNEO in EPM and TST both, indicating the possible involvement of 5-HT1A receptor. The neurochemical analysis showed no alteration in monoamine levels in mice brains. Furthermore, no locomotor impairment or sign of toxicity or changes in body weight or abnormalities in the biochemical parameters, except for a significant decrease in total cholesterol level was observed after treatment with PNEO. The findings suggest that Piper nigrum EO possesses a dual anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect through the possible involvement of serotonergic transmission."

Inflammation leads to an increase in hepcidin expression, which dysregulates body iron level. The related disorder, anemia of inflammation, is the second most prevalent anemia-related disorder worldwide. In the present study, we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the effect of black pepper (BP) and its major bioactive alkaloid, piperine, on anemia of inflammation. The initial in vitro study using human hepatocyte cell line, HepG2, confirmed that among different black pepper extracts: methanol (BPME), ethanol (BPEE) and aqueous (BPAE), BPME to be most effective in downregulating transcription of hepcidin gene. Further, BPME and piperine significantly downregulated hepcidin protein expression at 200 μg/ml and 100 μM concentrations, respectively. In the next phase, BPME and piperine were found to significantly attenuate BMP-6 and IL-6 induced hepcidin overexpression by downregulating the increased level of pSMAD1 and pSTAT3 proteins, respectively. For in vivo study, we first subcutaneously injected male BALB/c mice with oil of turpentine, thrice within a period of two weeks, in order to enhance the expression of hepcidin. After that, the intraperitoneal administration of BPME and piperine at 70 and 25 mg/kg body weight, respectively, on alternate days for a period of another two weeks resulted in downregulation of hepcidin overexpression in diseased mice, as confirmed by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. The histopathology of liver tissue confirmed increased iron bioavailability in BPME and piperine treated animals. The molecular docking-based interaction studies demonstrated the binding potential of piperine with SMAD1 and STAT3 proteins. The binding patterns supported the proposed inhibition of hepcidin activating proteins. All together, these findings suggest black pepper as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of anemia of inflammation.",

A total of 180 crossbred [(Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc] finishing pigs with average initial body weight (BW) of 53.7 ± 1.42 kg were used in 10-week trial and allotted to 6 dietary treatments (6 replications pens/treatment with 5 pigs per pen). The dietary treatments were: CON (basal diet), TRT1-CON + 0.025% BPE, TRT2-CON + 0.05% BPE, TRT3-CON + 0.1% BPE, TRT4-CON + 0.2% BPE, TRT5-CON + 0.4% BPE. Linear increase in body weight gain (BWG) (p = 0.038, 0.006) and average daily gain (ADG) were observed (p = 0.035, 0.007,and 0.006 respectively), during the overall trial in pigs fed increasing levels of BPE in supplemented diet compared to control. The dietary supplementation of BPE showed a linear increase (p = 0.007) in gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) at week 10. However, there were no significant results observed on average daily feed intake (ADFI) during the overall experiment. The total tract digestibility of dry matter (DM) was linearly improved (p = 0.053) with graded levels of BPE. In addition, BPE diet supplementation had linearly increased fecal Lactobacillus counts (p = 0.048) and decreased Escherichia coli counts (p = 0.031) in pigs at week 10. Furthermore, NH3, methyl mercaptans, and acetic acid was linearly decreased (p = 0.023, 0.056, 0.054) in pigs fed graded level of BPE supplementation. The inclusion of BPE in pigs' diet had linearly increased (p = 0.015) backfat thickness at week 10. Thus, we concluded that BPE supplementation had positively enhanced the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal microbial, fecal gas emission, and meat quality of finishing pigs."

      "abstract": "Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) has been employed in medicine (epilepsy, headaches, and diabetes), where its effects are mainly attributed to a nitrogen alkaloid called piperidine (1-(1-[1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl]-1-oxo-2,4 pentenyl) piperidine). Piperine co-administered with vitamins and minerals has improved its absorption. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the impact of the joint administration of iron (Fe) plus black pepper in physically active healthy individuals. Fe is a micronutrient that aids athletic performance by influencing the physiological functions involved in endurance sports by improving the transport, storage, and utilization of oxygen. Consequently, athletes have risk factors for Fe depletion, Fe deficiency, and eventually, anemia, mainly from mechanical hemolysis, gastrointestinal disturbances, and loss of Fe through excessive sweating. Declines in Fe stores have been reported to negatively alter physical capacities such as aerobic capacity, strength, and skeletal muscle recovery in elite athletes. Thus, there is a need to maintain Fe storage, even if Fe intake meets the recommended daily allowance (RDA), and Fe supplementation may be justified in physically active individuals, in states of Fe deficiency, with or without anemia. Females, in particular, should monitor their Fe hematological profile. The recommended oral Fe supplements are ferrous or ferric salts, sulfate, fumarate, and gluconate. These preparations constitute the first line of treatment; however, the high doses administered have gastrointestinal side effects that reduce tolerance and adherence to treatment. Thus, a strategy to counteract these adverse effects is to improve the bioavailability of Fe. Therefore, piperine may benefit the absorption of Fe through its bioavailability enhancement properties. Three research studies of Fe associated with black pepper have reported improvements in parameters related to the metabolism of Fe, without adverse effects. Although more research is needed, this could represent an advance in oral Fe supplementation for physically active individuals.",

      "abstract": "Some evidence indicated that human babesiosis caused by Babesia duncani has spread widely in North America. However, current therapeutic regimens (atovaquone + azithromycin) for human babesiosis are suboptimal with frequent recrudescence and side effects, and furthermore, there is no specific treatment for human babesiosis caused by B. duncani. Here, we screened 97 essential oils and identified 10 essential oils (garlic, black pepper, tarragon, palo santo, coconut, pine, meditation, cajeput, moringa, and stress relief) at a low concentration (0.001%; v/v) that showed good inhibitory activity against B. duncani in the hamster red blood cell culture model. Among them, garlic oil and black pepper oil performed best, as well as their potential active ingredients diallyl disulfide (DADS) and β-caryophyllene (BCP), respectively. Interestingly, further subculture study indicated that B. duncani could relapse after treatment with current therapeutic drugs atovaquone or azithromycin even at high concentrations. In contrast, the combination of garlic oil or DADS and azithromycin showed eradication of B. duncani at low concentrations without regrowth. These results are encouraging and suggest that the garlic-derived sulfur compound DADS and β-caryophyllene (BCP) may be promising drug candidates for evaluation of their ability to cure persistent B. duncani infections in the future."

A total of 225 Japanese quails (1-week-old) were haphazardly divided into 5 groups, each group consists of 45 unsexed birds with 5 replications (9 birds each). The first group was fed basal diet (control), and the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th groups fed rations containing BRPO (0.4, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.6 g/kg diet respectively). During 1-3 weeks of age, body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were improved with dietary BRPO. During 3-5 and 1-5 weeks of age, BWG was quadratically increased with BRPO supplementation. Also, a quadratic improvement in FCR was observed with BRPO during the overall period. There were no statistical differences in all carcass parameters due to BRPO treatment. Feeding quails on rations enriched with BRPO was linearly influenced liver functions. The highest BRPO levels (1.2 and 1.6 g/kg diet) minimized plasma content of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced in quails fed diets supplemented with BRPO. In apart from the highest level of BRPO, complement 3 (C3) was increased with increasing BRPO level. Birds fed diets enriched with BRPO exhibited lower colonization of TBC, lactobacilli, coliform, Salmonella and E. coli than those in the control group. It could be concluded that dietary BRPO can positively affect quail growth, liver and kidney functions, antioxidant and immunity parameters, lipid profile and lipid peroxidation as well as pathogenic bacteria.",

The sample was irradiated by UV-A and UV-C combined with TiO2 coating. After treatment, microbial and physicochemical analysis was carried out. Among various sterilization conditions, the largest number of pathogen in black pepper powder was inactivated by UV-A and UV-C combined with TiO2 coating. The microbial count of black pepper powder treated simultaneously with UV-A and UV-C was less than that of black pepper powder treated with alone. The inactivation effect of UV-A and UV-C was increased when TiO2 coating was combined. Moisture content was decreased with increasing treatment time, but color did not change. In this study, it was indicated that the combined treatment of UV-C, UV-A and TiO2 coating was effective for reducing S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 on black pepper powder."

      "abstract": "Salmonella persistence in ground black pepper has caused several foodborne outbreaks and created public concern about the safety of low water activity (aw) foods. In this study, radiofrequency (RF) processing was evaluated for pasteurization of ground black pepper. Stability and homogeneity tests were done for both Salmonella spp. and E. faecium during moisture equilibration before RF heating to evaluate the inoculation method. Moisture content of samples were conditioned such that the final moisture content after RF heating reached the optimal storage moisture. RF heating was shown to provide more than 5.98 log CFU/g reduction for Salmonella spp. and the reduction of 3.89 log CFU/g for E. faecium with a 130 s of treatment time. The higher thermal resistance of E. faecium indicated its suitability as surrogate for Salmonella spp. during RF heating of ground black pepper. Piperine, total phenolics, volatile compounds, and antioxidant activity were assessed as quality parameters for ground black pepper. The results demonstrated that the RF processing provided effective inactivation of Salmonella spp. with insignificant (p > 0.05) quality deterioration.",

The treated pepper powder was analyzed microbiologically, and the physicochemical properties of the pepper powder were examined. UV-C combined with heat treatment at 60 °C most effectively inactivated the pathogens. However, heat treatment at 60 °C produced many injured cells and greatly reduced moisture content of the pepper powder. UV-C combined with heat treatment at 45 °C showed significantly (p < 0.05) similar inactivation results as that with heat treatment at 60 °C after 18 min. In addition, the combined treatment minimized the moisture loss and color change of the pepper powder compared to heat treatment at 60 °C. Thus, UV-C and heat treatment at 45 °C can effectively inactivate pathogens while maintaining the quality of black pepper powder."

One hundred and forty weaned NZW rabbits were divided randomly into seven groups in a completely randomized experiment using different quantities of red pepper oil (RPO; 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 g/kg diet) or black pepper oil (BPO; 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 g/kg diet), in addition to the control group. Compared to the control, values of live body weight (LBW) for rabbits fed either RPO or BPO enriched diets were greater. The concentrations of serum triglycerides and cholesterol were lower (p < 0.01) in the RPO- and BPO-treated groups than in the control. Immunity parameters and antioxidant indices were improved in treated groups in comparison to the control. Dietary RPO or BPO can affect some growth traits, improve immunity parameters and the antioxidant activity, and decrease the lipid profile and lipid peroxidation. The use of 0.5 g RPO/kg diet as a dietary supplement had a larger effect on growth parameters than the other treatment groups."

      "abstract": "Pleiotropic effects of spices on health, particularly on glucose metabolism and energy regulation, deserve further clinical investigation into their efficacy. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether consumption of a black pepper-based beverage (BPB) preload containing 20 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) would exert any effect on postprandial glycaemia, appetite sensations, gut hormones, thyroid function, and gastrointestinal well-being after a white wheat bread (WWB) challenge meal containing 50 g available carbohydrates (CHO) compared to a control beverage. Sixteen healthy subjects (10 men; 6 women; 26 ± 0.9 years; BMI 22.93 ± 0.53 kg m-2) completed a randomized, crossover intervention study. The BPB's bioactive compounds were characterized using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source (UHPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS). Nine compounds tentatively identified in BPB include: dihydroxybenzoic acid hexoside-pentoside, decaffeoyl-acteoside, cynaroside A, apigenin 6,8-di-C-hexoside, luteolin 6-C-hexoside-8-C-rhamnoside, apigenin 8-C-hexoside-C-deoxyhexoside, kaempferol 3-rhamnoside-4'-xyloside, apigenin 7-neohesperidoside, and apigenin-8-C-arabinopyranoside-2''-rhamnoside. Blood glucose and serum insulin responses, insulin sensitivity and β-cell function were not affected during the acute intervention with BPB. Neither were effects on gastrointestinal well-being observed after BPB. However, BPB modulated overall acute appetite by lowering 'hunger', 'desire to eat', and 'prospective consumption', and increasing 'satiety' and 'fullness'. In contrast, there were no changes in gut (peptide tyrosine-tyrosine [PYY] and glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1]) and thyroid (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine [T4]) hormones after BPB compared to the control beverage. In conclusion, inclusion of BPB prior to the WWB challenge meal might be beneficial for appetite modulation, but we did not find supporting evidence in glycaemia, gut and thyroid hormones. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of appetite-reducing pungent spices, such as black pepper.",

Plasma treatment time of 300 s led to log10 CFU/g reduction of B. subtilis from 7.36 to 2.30 and B. subtilis endospores from 4.42 to 2.39. Plasma treatment reduced the number of E. coli and Salmonella Enteritidis to below detection level (1.0 log10 CFU/g) from initial populations of 7.45 log10 CFU/g and 7.60 log10 CFU/g, respectively. The inactivation kinetics was explained by Weibull model. Decimal reduction times (D-values) for B. subtilis, E. coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, and B. subtilis endospores were determined as 43 s, 47 s, 58 s, and 142 s, respectively. The surface morphology observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy showed no significant changes after the plasma treatment.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations of BPPE against L. monocytogenes and S. typhimurium were 0.625 and 1.25 mg/ml, respectively. Detection of Alkaline phosphatase outside the cell revealed that BPPE treatment destroyed the cell wall integrity. BPPE also altered the membrane integrity, thereby causing leaching of 260 and 280 nm UV-absorbing materials into the medium, particularly, nucleic acids and proteins. Propidium iodide infiltration experiments also indicated that BPPE treatment altered the permeability of bacterial cell membrane. Moreover, Na+/K+-ATPase activity was inhibited by BPPE. And the results of scanning electron microscopy showed that BPPE treatment damaged the morphology of the tested bacteria. These results indicated that BPPE could destroy cell wall integrity, alter the permeability of cell membrane, and inhibit the activity of intracellular enzyme, which could kill bacteria."

In the present study, toxicity of different extracts of black pepper was evaluated by incorporating diffferent doses of extracts into the artificial diet of red palm weevil larvae. All extracts showed dose-dependent insecticidal activity to the tested eighth-instar red palm weevil larvae. Among all the extracts, maximum larvicidal activity was exhibited by chloroform (LD50 = 342.62 mg/l), followed by dichloromethane (LD50 = 357.78 mg/l), acetone (LD50 = 372.57 mg/l), and ethanol (LD50 = 408.88 mg/l). However, piperine, a major constituent of all black pepper extracts identified by GC-MS in the present work, was found to be the most potent treatment exhibiting the least LD50 (219.88 mg/l). In addition, nutritional indices evaluated by calculating the efficiency of the conversion of ingested food (ECI) and digested food (ECD) at the same dose (219.88 mg/l) showed that there was maximum reduction in the ECI (49.90%) and ECD (62.21%) index of larvae fed diets incorporated with piperine. Larvae that were fed diets incorporated with different black pepper extracts experienced increases in the expression of detoxification genes (glutathione S-transferase and cytochrome P450), and this upregulation in detoxification genes (glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome P450 and esterase) was tremendously high in larvae fed diets incorporated with piperine. Results suggest that piperine is a promising bio-pesticide agent for the control of R. ferrugineus Olivier.",

      "abstract": "Piperine has several well-documented anti-inflammatory properties; however, little is known regarding its effect on humoral immunity. In this study, we describe the immunosuppressive effect of piperine on B lymphocytes, which are integral to the humoral immune response. Mouse B cells were cultured in the absence or presence of non-cytotoxic concentrations (25, 50, and 100 μM) of piperine during T-dependent or T-independent stimulation. Piperine inhibited B cell proliferation by causing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in association with reduced expression of cyclin D2 and D3. The inhibitory effect of piperine was not mediated through transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 ion channel (TRPV1) because piperine also inhibited the proliferation of B cells from TRPV1-deficient mice. Expression of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and costimulatory CD40 and CD86 on B lymphocytes was reduced in the presence of piperine, as was B cell-mediated antigen presentation to syngeneic T cells. In addition, piperine inhibited B cell synthesis of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 cytokines, as well as IgM, IgG2b, and IgG3 immunoglobulins. The inhibitory effect of piperine on B lymphocyte activation and effector function warrants further investigation for possible application in the treatment of pathologies related to inappropriate humoral immune responses.

Patients' serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were assessed before and after treatment and also compared with healthy controls. The response to treatment was analyzed using analysis of variance, paired t test, and unpaired t test. RESULTS: After the treatment, groups A and B showed 3.85 ± 0.22 mm and 3.6 ± 0.07 mm improvement in mouth opening, respectively (P < .01); 87.90% and 78.91% reduction in burning sensation, respectively (P < .01); and +0.62 U/mL and +0.74 U/mL improvement in serum SOD levels, respectively (P < .05).

An experiment was conducted in broilers with different feed formulations; control feed, with no added fenugreek, garlic, and black pepper powder; and 8 treatment groups receiving feed supplemented with different combinations of fenugreek, garlic, and black pepper powder. The individual broilers' body weight and feed consumption were recorded and calculate the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR). RESULTS: Broiler's weight gain and FCR were significantly higher in groups receiving feed supplemented with garlic and black pepper powder combinations (p<0.01). Cumulative feed consumption was significantly higher in groups receiving feed supplemented with garlic and black pepper powder combinations (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The combination of garlic and black pepper powder supplemented broiler feed fed groups showed higher production performance. The 5 g/kg garlic powder+1 g/kg black pepper powder and 10 g/kg garlic powder+2 g/kg black pepper powder significantly improved the weight gain and FCR."

      "abstract": "Black pepper is a perennial plant that can bloom throughout the year. It is generally expected that pepper inflorescence quantity could be minimized at the nonfull-bloom stage. The objective of this study was to find an appropriate shading measure that could inhibit blooming at other growing stages except the full-bloom stage and did not cause any reduction in pepper yield and quality. In this study, pepper trees were shaded up to 15%, 30%, 60% and 75%, respectively, and the inflorescence quantity, photosynthetic characteristics, pepper yield and quality traits were investigated at every growing stage. The results showed that the effect of shading on pepper yield decreased as time progressed. Shading treatment did not alter the composition of piperine and volatile oil, but reduced the moisture content. Based on the correlation between photosynthetic parameter and inflorescence number, the appropriate shading intensities for regulating inflorescence quantity at different phenological stages were determined. Moreover, it was found that the regulation of inflorescence quantity could be achieved by controlling leaf temperature during recovery to filling period. This research outcome also will give us some guidelines to develop other management strategies that control leaf temperature and regulate inflorescence quantity to consequently improve pepper yield.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) is exposed to microbial contamination which could potentially create public health risk and also rejection of consignments in the export market due to non-adherance to microbial safety standards. The present study investigates the use of microwave (MW) radiation for microbial load reduction in black pepper and analyses the effect on quality. RESULTS: Black pepper was exposed to MWs at two different power levels (663 and 800 W) at an intensity of 40 W g(-1) for different time intervals (1-15 min) and moisture content (110 and 260 g kg(-1) on a wet basis). The exposure of black pepper to MWs at 663 W for 12.5 min was found to be sufficient to reduce the microbial load to the permissible level suggested by the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods and the European Spice Association. The retention of volatile oil, piperine and resin was 91.3 ± 0.03, 87.6 ± 0.02 and 90.7 ± 0.05%, respectively, in MW-treated black pepper. The final moisture content after MW treatment was found to be 100 ± 1 g kg(-1) for black pepper containing initial moisture of 260 ± 3 g kg(-1) . CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MW heating can be effectively used for microbial load reduction of black pepper without a significant loss in product quality. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The present study examined the effect of gaseous acetic acid treatment in reducing Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis and Bacillus subtilis populations inoculated on fenugreek seeds and black pepper. Treatment with gaseous acetic acid at 0.3 mmol/L, 0.6 mmol/L and 4.7 mmol/L for 1-3 h significantly reduced the populations of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Enteritidis on black pepper and fenugreek seeds at 55 °C (p < 0.05). The gas treatments at 4.7 mmol/L were more effective in inactivating the pathogens than the treatment at 0.3 mmol/L. An approximately 5.0 log reduction was obtained after 3 h of treatment with 4.7 mmol/L acetic acid. No significant reductions in the population of B. subtilis spores inoculated on fenugreek seeds and black pepper were obtained after the gas treatments at 0.3 mmol/L or 0.6 mmol/L (p > 0.05). However, the gas treatment at 4.7 mmol/L significantly reduced B. subtilis spores (p < 0.05), and 4.0 log CFU/g and 3.5 log CFU/g reductions on fenugreek seeds and black pepper, respectively, were obtained after 3 h of treatment.",

An in vivo study was carried out on 50 adult healthy male albino rats which were divided into 5 groups, 10 rats each. Group 1: negative control group which received saline solution intragastrically daily; Group 2: Positive control group, injected with mixed bacterial suspension of S.aureus and E.coli as a model of pyelonephritis, then received saline solution intragastrically daily; Group 3: injected with the same dose of mixed bacterial suspension, then received 100 mg/kg/day black pepper extract intragastrically; Group 4: injected with mixed bacterial suspension then received 500 mg/kg/day ginger extract intragastrically. Group 5: injected with mixed bacterial suspension then received 500 mg/kg/day thyme extract intragastrically. All groups were sacrificed after either 1 or 4 weeks. Serum and blood samples were collected for lysozyme activity estimation using agarose lysoplate, measurement of nitric oxide production, and lymphocyte transformation test as well as for counting both total and differential leukocytes and erythrocytes. Kidney samples were tested histopathologically. Both in vivo and in vitro results confirm the efficacy of these extracts as natural antimicrobials and suggest the possibility of using them in treatment procedures.",

      "abstract": "Piperine, a piperidine alkaloid present in black pepper, inhibits the growth of cancer cells, although the mechanism of action is not well understood. In this study, we show that piperine (75-150 µM) inhibited the growth of several colon cancer cell lines but had little effect on the growth of normal fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Piperine inhibited HT-29 colon carcinoma cell proliferation by causing G1 phase cell cycle arrest that was associated with decreased expression of cyclins D1 and D3 and their activating partner cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, as well as reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and up-regulation of p21/WAF1 and p27/KIP1 expression. In addition, piperine caused hydroxyl radical production and apoptosis that was partially dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species. Piperine-treated HT-29 cells showed loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, as well as caspase activation and reduced apoptosis in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK. Increased expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated proteins inositol-requiring 1α protein, C/EBP homologous protein, and binding immunoglobulin protein, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, as well as decreased phosphorylation of Akt and reduced survivin expression were also observed in piperine-treated HT-29 cells. Furthermore, piperine inhibited colony formation by HT-29 cells, as well as the growth of HT-29 spheroids. Cell cycle arrest and endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis following piperine treatment of HT-29 cells provides the first evidence that piperine may be useful in the treatment of colon cancer.",

The effect of RF heating on the quality of powdered red and black pepper spices with different moisture ranges was also investigated. Red pepper (12.6%, 15.2%, 19.1%, and 23.3% dry basis, db) and black pepper (10.1%, 17.2%, 23.7%, and 30.5% db) inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were treated in a RF heating system with 27.12 MHz. The heating rate of the sample was dependent on moisture content up to 19.1% (db) of red pepper and 17.2% (db) of black pepper, but there was a significant decrease in the heating rate when the moisture content was increased beyond these levels. The dielectric properties of both samples increased with a rise in moisture content. As the moisture content increased, treatment time required to reduce E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium by more than 7 log CFU/g (below the detection limit, 1 log CFU/g) decreased and then increased again without affecting product quality when the moisture content exceeded a level corresponding to the peak heating rate. RF treatment significantly (P<0.05) reduced moisture content of both spices. These results suggest that RF heating can be effectively used to not only control pathogens but also reduce moisture levels in spices and that the effect of inactivation is dependent on moisture content.",

Black pepper and red pepper inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium were subjected to gamma irradiation in the range of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5 kGy, and color change was evaluated after treatment. Pathogen populations decreased with increasing treatment doses. A gamma irradiation dose of 5 kGy decreased E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium populations >4.4 to >5.2 log CFU/g in black pepper without causing color change. Similarly, 5 kGy of gamma irradiation yielded reduction of 3.8 to >5.2 log CFU/g for E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium in red pepper. During gamma irradiation treatment, L*, a* and b* values of red pepper were not significantly changed except for 297 μm to 420 μm size red pepper treated with 5 kGy of gamma irradiation. Based on the D-value of pathogens in black pepper and red pepper, S. Typhimurium showed more resistant to gamma irradiation than did E. coli O157:H7. These results show that gamma irradiation has potential as a non-thermal process for inactivating foodborne pathogens in spices with minimal color changes.",

INTERVENTIONS: Topical application of 20% essential oil of black pepper in aloe vera gel or standard nursing care (hot packs with or without vigorous tactile stimulation). OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and post-test vein visibility and/or palpability and number of attempts at IVC insertion. RESULTS: A higher percentage of patients achieved optimal scoring (vein score=2) or improved scoring (vein score of 1 or 2) to black pepper intervention than standard nursing care. The black pepper group also reduced the number of patients whose veins were still not visible or palpable after the intervention to nearly half that of the control group (p<0.05). The number of IVC attempts following black pepper was also half that of the control group. CONCLUSION: Topical application of black pepper is a viable and effective way to enhance vein visibility and palpability prior to intravenous insertion in patients with limited vein accessibility; it also improves ease of IVC insertion.",

The primary aim of the present study was to test the acute effects of black pepper (pepper), ginger, horseradish and mustard in a meal on 4 h postprandial DIT. The secondary aim was to examine the effects on subjective appetite measures, ad libitum EI and energy balance. In a five-way placebo-controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial, twenty-two young (age 24·9 (SD 4·6) years), normal-weight (BMI 21·8 (SD 2·1) kg/m²) males were randomly assigned to receive a brunch meal with either pepper (1·3 g), ginger (20 g), horseradish (8·3 g), mustard (21 g) or no spices (placebo). The amounts of spices were chosen from pre-testing to make the meal spicy but palatable. No significant treatment effects were observed on DIT, but mustard produced DIT, which tended to be larger than that of placebo (14 %, 59 (SE 3) v. 52 (SE 2) kJ/h, respectively, P=0·08). No other spice induced thermogenic effects approaching statistical significance. Subjective measures of appetite (P>0·85), ad libitum EI (P=0·63) and energy balance (P=0·67) also did not differ between the treatments. Finally, horseradish decreased heart rate (P=0·048) and increased diastolic blood pressure (P= 0·049) compared with placebo. In conclusion, no reliable treatment effects on appetite, EI or energy balance were observed, although mustard tended to be thermogenic at this dose. Further studies should explore the possible strength and mechanisms of the potential thermogenic effect of mustard actives, and potential enhancement by, for example, combinations with other food components.",

Both black pepper extract and piperine, without affecting cytotoxicity, strongly inhibited the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. The mRNA expression of the master adipogenic transcription factors, PPARγ, SREBP-1c, and C/EBPβ, was markedly decreased. Intriguingly, mRNA levels of PPARγ target genes were also down-regulated. Moreover, a luciferase reporter assay indicated that pipierine significantly represses the rosiglitazone-induced PPARγ transcriptional activity. Finally, GST-pull down assays demonstrated that piperine disrupts the rosiglitazone-dependent interaction between PPARγ and coactivator CBP. Genome-wide analysis using microarray further supports the role of piperine in regulating genes associated with lipid metabolism. Overall, these results suggest that piperine, a major component of black pepper, attenuates fat cell differentiation by down-regulating PPARγ activity as well as suppressing PPARγ expression, thus leading to potential treatment for obesity-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "The effect of phosphine on Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis inoculated in culture medium and in black pepper grains (Piper nigrum), as well as on the reduction of the microbial load of the dried and moisturized product, was verified. The postfumigation effect was verified in inoculated samples with 0.92 and 0.97 water activity (a(w)) exposed to 6 g/m(3) phosphine for 72 h, dried to 0.67 a(w), and stored for 24, 48, and 72 h. No decreases were observed in Salmonella Enteritidis populations in culture medium when fumigant concentrations up to 6 g/m(3) were applied for 48 h at 35°C. However, the colonies showed reductions in size and atypical coloration as the phosphine concentration increased. No reduction in Salmonella counts occurred on the inoculated dried samples after fumigation. On the other hand, when phosphine at concentrations of 6 g/m(3) was applied on moisturized black pepper for 72 h, decreases in Salmonella counts of around 80% were observed. The counts of total aerobic mesophilic bacterium populations of the dried and moisturized black pepper were not affected by the fumigant treatment. The results of the postfumigation studies indicated that Salmonella Enteritidis was absent in the fumigated grains after drying and storage for 72 h, indicating a promising application for this technique. It was concluded that for Salmonella Enteritidis control, phosphine fumigation could be applied to black pepper grains before drying and the producers should rigidly follow good agricultural practices, mainly during the drying process, in order to avoid product recontamination. Additional work is needed to confirm the findings with more Salmonella serotypes and strains.",

AREAS COVERED: This review deals with the effects of black pepper and piperine on drug metabolizing enzymes as well as on intestinal drug absorption. The review provides the reader with a comprehensive update on the potential mechanisms and pharmacokinetic interactions of black pepper and piperine with co-administered medicines. The article also provides a comprehensive update on the current known issues with black pepper and piperine. The information provided is used to assess the clinical significance of black pepper and piperine and optimize their effectiveness as a bioavailability enhancer. EXPERT OPINION: For black pepper or piperine to be widely applicable in current medical practice, as a combination therapy, the clinical significance of food-drug interactions caused by concurrent use of black pepper or piperine should be carefully assessed with consideration for many compounding factors affecting the clinical outcome of pharmacokinetic interactions (e.g., dose, dosing regimen, genetic variation and species). Furthermore, the effective formulation strategy for the optimization of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of dietary components is crucial to improve their in vivo performance and ultimately maximize their effectiveness as a bioavailability enhancer.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The presented study is aimed on exploring the effects of black pepper on blood pressure in the rat model of experimental hypertension induced by chronic NO synthesis inhibition. BACKGROUND: Piperine, the compound of black pepper, can cause a significant decrease of blood pressure in normotensive rats possibly via calcium channel blockade, a pathway that is known to be effective in prevention of L-NAME (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) induced hypertension. METHODS: Wistar rats were administered clear water (C), L-NAME (40 mg/kg/day, L), piperine (20 mg/kg/day) in corn oil by oral gavage with L-NAME (LP) or without it (P) for 6 weeks. The systolic blood pressure was measured weekly. Specimens of thoracic aorta were processed in paraffin and histological slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Mallory's phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH), orcein, antibodies against inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and smooth muscle cells actin (SMCA). Microscopic pictures were digitally processed and morphometrically evaluated. RESULTS: L-NAME increased the blood pressure, cross-sectional area of aorta, media thickness, elastin and SMCA synthesis and PTAH positive myofibrils relative and absolute content in the aortic media, wheras it decreased percentual content of iNOS, elastin and SMCA. Piperine decreased the blood pressure rise from the third week of treatment, synthesis of elastin and the percentual and absolute content of PTAH positive myofibrils, however, it did not affect other parameters. CONCLUSION: Oral administration of piperine is able to partially prevent the increase of blood pressure caused by chronic L-NAME administration. This effect is probably caused by the blockage of voltage-dependent calcium channels and supported by filamentous actin disassembly (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 35).",

Irradiation resulted in a higher microbial reduction in pepper, with minimal effects on the proximate composition, functional components, color, and sensory attributes of the spice. Steamed peppers appeared darker, and a considerable decrease in the piperine content was observed after treatment and storage. This study illustrates that irradiation is a better decontamination method than steam treatment in eliminating microorganisms without apparently affecting the quality of the powdered spice. Storage at 4 degrees C enhanced the microbial quality and minimized the loss of piperine content in ground black peppers.",

      "abstract": "Patients with severe neurological disorders often require enteral nutrition (EN). Since long-term EN can cause multiple complications, reinstating the oral intake of food is beneficial. Olfactory stimulation using black pepper oil (BPO), a strong appetite stimulant, was reported to facilitate swallowing in older people. Therefore, the effects of olfactory stimulation with BPO were investigated in pediatric patients receiving long-term EN due to neurological disorders. The effects of scenting with BPO for 1 min immediately before every meal were evaluated in ten patients: 4 boys and 6 girls, aged 19-97 months (51 +/- 26 months). The neurological disorders included periventricular leukomalacia (3 patients), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (3), Costello syndrome (1), Russell-Silver syndrome (1), Miller-Dieker syndrome (1), and cerebral palsy of unknown etiology (1). In eight of these patients, BPO intervention was continued for 3 months. Five of these eight patients showed increases in the amount of oral intake with desirable effects including facilitated swallowing movement, although complete elimination of the need for EN was not achieved. In the other three patients, BPO intervention was not effective; severe cerebral tissue loss, profound malformation or intractable seizures seemed to reduce the efficacy of BPO. In two cases, BPO intervention was discontinued due to cough or because the odor of BPO was unbearable to the family. In conclusion, olfactory stimulation with BPO facilitated oral intake in a subset of patients on long-term EN. BPO stimulation may be useful for facilitating oral intake when used in combination with conventional methods.",

      "abstract": "Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is one of the most widely used among spices. It is valued for its distinct biting quality attributed to the alkaloid, piperine. Black pepper is used not only in human dietaries but also for a variety of other purposes such as medicinal, as a preservative, and in perfumery. Many physiological effects of black pepper, its extracts, or its major active principle, piperine, have been reported in recent decades. Dietary piperine, by favorably stimulating the digestive enzymes of pancreas, enhances the digestive capacity and significantly reduces the gastrointestinal food transit time. Piperine has been demonstrated in in vitro studies to protect against oxidative damage by inhibiting or quenching free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Black pepper or piperine treatment has also been evidenced to lower lipid peroxidation in vivo and beneficially influence cellular thiol status, antioxidant molecules and antioxidant enzymes in a number of experimental situations of oxidative stress. The most far-reaching attribute of piperine has been its inhibitory influence on enzymatic drug biotransforming reactions in the liver. It strongly inhibits hepatic and intestinal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Piperine has been documented to enhance the bioavailability of a number of therapeutic drugs as well as phytochemicals by this very property. Piperine's bioavailability enhancing property is also partly attributed to increased absorption as a result of its effect on the ultrastructure of intestinal brush border. Although initially there were a few controversial reports regarding its safety as a food additive, such evidence has been questionable, and later studies have established the safety of black pepper or its active principle, piperine, in several animal studies. Piperine, while it is non-genotoxic, has in fact been found to possess anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor influences.",

Two packs for each treatment were opened every 4 days for subsequent analysis of colour CIE L(∗), a(∗), b(∗), TBARS, microbial psychrotrophic aerobes and sensory discolouration and off-odour. Lighting with standard fluorescent was highly deleterious for sausage display life, which fell from 12 to 8 days due mainly to early discolouration. Inserting a UV-filter extended display life to 12 days, while the use of a low-UV lamp was not effective in protecting from discolouration. Addition of rosemary plus ascorbic acid, in the absence of black pepper, retarded discolouration only in sausages illuminated with the UV-filter, reaching a display life of 16 days, equal to that of sausages maintained in the dark."

SETTING: Nursing homes in Japan that serve as long-term care facilities for older residents who are physically handicapped, mainly because of cerebrovascular disease. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred five poststroke residents. MEASUREMENTS: Latency of the swallowing reflex (LTSR), the number of swallowing movements, serum substance P (SP), and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). RESULTS: Nasal inhalation of BPO for 1 minute shortened LTSR, compared with that of lavender oil and distilled water (P < .03). Compared with the period before the study, the 1-month intervention using BPO improved LTSR with an increase of serum SP (P < .01). The number of swallowing movements for 1 minute during the nasal inhalation of BPO increased (P < .001). Multiple comparisons showed a poststudy increase in rCBF within the insular cortex (P < .001). Compared with the prestudy rCBF, BPO intervention increased rCBF in the right orbitofrontal and left insular cortex (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Inhalation of BPO, which can activate the insular or orbitofrontal cortex, resulting in improvement of the reflexive swallowing movement, might benefit older poststroke patients with dysphagia regardless of their level of consciousness or physical and mental status.",

A fraction with 5 kDa or bigger molecules was successively purified by open column chromatography on DEAE-Toyopearl 650C and Bio-gel P-60 with each active fraction, resulting in PN-Ib and PN-IIa, purified anti-complementary polysaccharides. None of the anti-complementary activity of any polysaccharide was changed by pronase digestion or polymyxin B treatment, but they were decreased by periodate oxidation. Analysis of component sugar and molecular mass determination of the anti-complementary polysaccharides indicated that PN-Ib with an average molecular mass of 21 kDa contained 88.5% glucose and other negligible minor monosaccharides, while PN-IIa showed a different monosaccharide composition, which contained a significant proportion of galactose, arabinose, galacturonic acid and rhamnose. The molar ratio of galactose and arabinose of PN-IIa (48 kDa) was 1.93:1. PN-1 did not react with beta-glucosyl Yariv reagent, however, PN-IIa did react, which indicated that PN-IIa might be an arabinogalactan. Based upon these results, the usefulness of purified anti-complementary polysaccharides from Piper nigrum is suggested as a supplement for immune enhancement.",

The most common bacterial isolates were of three genera Bacillus, Clostridium and Micrococcus (7.5 x 10(6)), whereas the predominant fungi (7.8 x 10(4)) were Aspergillus species, A. glaucus, A. flavus, A. niger and A. ochraceus. Doses of gamma irradiation used (5.0 and 10 kGy) were sufficient to decrease spore-forming bacteria (SFB) and to inhibit the fungal flora and coliforms which contaminated the black pepper powder. Microwave treatments for 40 s and 75 s were of the same effectiveness whereas treatment for 20 s was less so. GLC analysis proved the presence of 31 peaks, only 19 compounds were identified as monoterpene hydrocarbons (56.21%), the major one being beta-phellandrene and limonene. Sesquiterpenes were also present, mainly beta-caryollphyllene (3.69%) as well as oxygenated compounds such as terpenol, geraniol, Me-chavicol, eugenol and anisol. Gamma irradiation at 5 kGy and 10 kGy respectively decreased the numbers of identified compounds from 21 (86.58% concentration) in untreated pepper to 16 (59.22% concentration), 15 (54.06% concentration). In comparison, microwave treatments, particularly for 40 s and 75 s, increased the concentration of the same compounds. The results obtained indicate that microwave treatment, under these conditions, is a safe and suitable technique for decontamination of black pepper which does not result in a great loss of flavour compounds, as compared with recommended doses of gamma irradiation.",

In this study we investigated the subjective effects of a cigarette substitute delivering a vapor of black pepper essential oil. Forty-eight cigarette smokers participated in a 3-h session conducted after overnight deprivation from smoking. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: one group of smokers puffed on a device that delivered a vapor from essential oil of black pepper; a second group puffed on the device with a mint/menthol cartridge, and a third group used a device containing an empty cartridge. Subjects puffed and inhaled ad libitum from the device throughout the session during which no smoking was allowed. Reported craving for cigarettes was significantly reduced in the pepper condition relative to each of the two control conditions. In addition, negative affect and somatic symptoms of anxiety were alleviated in the pepper condition relative to the unflavored placebo. The intensity of sensations in the chest was also significantly higher for the pepper condition. These results support the view that respiratory tract sensations are important in alleviating smoking withdrawal symptoms.

      "abstract": "A water extract of the West African black pepper Piper guineense L. was tested for activity against audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice, and against seizures induced in T.O. mice by N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMDLA), pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and maximal electroschock. Single intraperitoneal doses of the extract produced significant protection of DBA/2 mice against audiogenic seizures. The highest of three doses tested produced 100% and 58% protection at 6 h and 18 h after treatment, respectively. The extract also protected T.O. mice against convulsions induced by NMDLA and maximal electroshock but it had no significant effect on PTZ-induced convulsions. The doses of the extract tested did not cause significant impairment of performance of T.O. mice on a rotarod test. The results indicate that the extract of P. guineense has prolonged anticonvulsant activity at doses which do not cause significant CNS depression.",
