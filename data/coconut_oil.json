      "abstract": "Simplah (SM) and pliek (PL) oils are derived from the traditional fermentation process of coconut meat, a practice in Aceh, Indonesia, for generations. We studied their chemical composition and interactions with proteins linked to atopic dermatitis (AD), causing inflammation and allergies. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of SM and PL from five coconut plantations in Aceh revealed 53 compounds with a similarity index (SI) ≥ 800. Peroxide and iodine values met standards, but moisture and free fatty acid content were slightly high. Phenolic and flavonoid content are correlated with antioxidant activity. Molecular docking showed l-(+)-ascorbic acid 2,6-dihexadecanoate (PN32) had high binding affinity to IL2 (-8.2801 kcal/mol), JNK1 (-9.5087 kcal/mol), TNF-α (-7.1581 kcal/mol), and ERK2 (-7.9420 kcal/mol). PN32 had significant inhibitory activity against JNK1 but lower stability than the control native ligand (CNL). It can be stated that SM and PL have potential as topical anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents in AD."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of coconut oil on the oral bacteriome and inflammatory response in patients with periodontitis by integrating next-generation sequencing analyses of pathogenic bacterial shifts and quantification of inflammatory markers, thereby assessing its potential as a natural adjunct to standard nonsurgical periodontal therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A triple-blind clinical trial was conducted with 30 participants diagnosed with periodontitis, randomized into 3 groups: (1) coconut oil, (2) chlorhexidine and (3) placebo. Saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected before treatment, one month after treatment, and one month post-non-surgical periodontal therapy. Bacterial DNA was extracted, and the V3-V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technologies. Inflammatory biomarkers, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were quantified from GCF samples. RESULTS: Coconut oil treatment significantly reduced pathogenic bacterial families such as Spirochaetaceae and Tannerellaceae while promoting beneficial bacteria such as Streptococcaceae. At the genus and species levels, coconut oil reduced pathogens such as Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola along with increase in beneficial bacteria such as Streptococcus. The subgingival microbial dysbiosis index improved significantly in both coconut oil and chlorhexidine groups. Furthermore, the coconut oil demonstrated a reduction in IL-6 and TNF-α levels, indicating decreased local inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Coconut oil treatment significantly modulated the oral microbiome and reduced inflammatory markers in patients with periodontitis, suggesting its potential as a natural and effective adjunct in periodontal therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study highlights coconut oil's potential as a natural adjunct in periodontal therapy, effectively reducing pathogenic bacteria and inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α). It offers a safe alternative to chlorhexidine, promoting microbiome balance and improved periodontal health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis and dental caries are among the most prevalent oral diseases, with chronic periodontitis being a multifactorial, infectious condition that leads to inflammation in the supporting structures of the teeth, progressive attachment loss, and bone resorption. Chronic periodontitis is driven by a consortium of pathogenic microorganisms. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of virgin coconut oil (VCO) pulling in reducing the microbial load and inflammatory mediators responsible for chronic periodontitis, in comparison to chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash and distilled water. METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated into three groups. Group A served as the control and used distilled water for oral rinsing, Group B used chlorhexidine mouthwash, and Group C performed oil pulling with virgin coconut oil. Pre-operative subgingival plaque samples were collected from all participants, followed by complete scaling and root planing. Post-operative samples were collected after four weeks. Both pre- and post-treatment samples were subjected to real-time PCR (rtPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify viral and bacterial loads, as well as levels of key inflammatory mediators. RESULTS: A significant reduction in viral load, bacterial load, and inflammatory mediators was observed in both the VCO and CHX groups compared to the distilled water group. The reductions in the VCO and CHX groups were statistically significant, with comparable efficacy between the two interventions. CONCLUSION: Virgin coconut oil pulling demonstrated a significant reduction in microbial and inflammatory markers in patients with chronic periodontitis, showing similar efficacy to chlorhexidine mouthwash. Given its comparable therapeutic effects and reduced side effect profile, VCO presents a viable alternative to chlorhexidine for managing chronic periodontitis."

Mongolian gerbils were used as an experimental model due to the morphological similarity of the adrenal glands to those of primates. Male Mongolian gerbils, 3 months of age, were divided into three experimental groups (n = 12): an intact control group, which received no treatment, a gavage control group, which received 0.1 ml of water daily by gavage, and a coconut oil-treated group, which received 0.1 ml of coconut oil daily for 12 months. The results showed that prolonged consumption of coconut oil caused an increase in cell area and thickness of the zona reticularis and the accumulation of lipid droplets, as well as reducing the amount of steroidogenic enzymes, such as CYP17, 3BHSD, and 17BHSD. It was also observed that the oil increased the expression of estrogen receptor alpha and their isoforms. These alterations allow us to conclude that changes in the lipid diet can cause alterations in the morphophysiology of the adrenal gland and, consequently, impact its functionality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a disease linked to the hormonal imbalance that occurs during aging and over the last decades, complementary and alternative medicines have come on the scene as a treatment option for BPH, such as herbal medicines. Coconut oil has been shown to be capable of interfering in testosterone-induced BPH. However, until now there is no study of the effect of coconut oil during aging. The present study evaluated the effect of the intake of coconut oil on the prostate of aging gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). METHODS: Two experimental groups were assigned: Gavage control (GC-animals subjected to gavage with water for 1 year, n = 11) and coconut oil (CO-animals subjected to gavage with coconut oil for 1 year, n = 11). Testosterone, and estradiol serum levels were determined by ELISA assay and histopathological analysis employed Hematoxylin-Eosin. Cell proliferation index was determined by PHH3 immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay and receptors of androgen (AR) and estrogen (ERα and ERβ) were evaluated on the prostate. RESULTS: The CO group exhibited a lower prostate weight (↓16.62%), decreased thickness of the prostate muscle stroma (↓18.27%), reduced expression of both AR (↓51.32) and ERα (↓14.26%) and reduced the percentage of BPH (↓1.53%) and intraepithelial neoplasms in the prostate (↓14.24%). Coconut oil intake mitigated age-related changes and increased the rate of apoptosis in prostatic cells (↑54.32). CONCLUSIONS: Coconut oil treatment throughout aging helped counteract the negative effects of aging on prostate health.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and affects approximately 50 million individuals worldwide. Interest in coconut oil (CO) as a potential dietary intervention has surged owing to its substantial medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) content. Therefore, sustaining cognitive function and potentially slowing the progression of AD are crucial. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of CO and its bioactive metabolites on AD and dementia. Methods: The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023450435). Relevant research articles published between January 2015 and June 2023 were systematically searched. Seven studies met the predetermined eligibility criteria. Thematic analysis was utilized to synthesis the data about the qualitative features, while meta-analysis was employed for the quantitative findings. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Forest plots were generated using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). Results: The analysis revealed that all studies showed consistent results regarding the effects of CO on cognitive scores, with little variability in the true effects of CO on cognitive scores across the studies included in the meta-analysis. Conclusions: CO improved cognitive scores in patients with AD compared with those in the control group (p < 0.05). The results of this study add to the increasing amount of evidence indicating that MCTs found in CO might be a way to improve abilities and potentially slow the advancement of AD. The findings of this study may encourage the development of targeted dietary strategies and interventions for individuals at risk of or diagnosed with AD."

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the effects of two different types of fat (krill oil [KO] and coconut oil [CO]) on obesity, behavioral tests, and some inflammatory markers when consumed with a high-fat or control diet in rats with depression. The study was conducted mainly in two phases: the induction of depression (37 days) and the dietary intervention (60 days). After the induction of depression by chronic unpredictable mild stress, dietary intervention started. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups with 10 rats in each group: (1) standard diet (SD), (2) SD + 5% KO, (3) SD + 5% medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)* (*CO to contain 5% MCT), (4) high-fat diet (HFD), (5) HFD + 5% KO, and (6) HFD + 5% MCT*. The open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and sucrose preference test were performed at baseline, end of the depression induction, and dietary intervention to observe behavioral changes in rats. After the final behavioral test, animals were sacrificed, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analyses C-reactive protein (milligram per liter), cortisol (microgram per deciliter), and insulin (micro-international units per milliliter) to assess inflammatory changes in the blood. All data were analyzed under two headings: baseline, end of depression induction, end of dietary intervention, and dietary intervention groups. Body weight gain was highest in the SD+KO and lowest in the SD+MCT group (P < .05). When behavioral tests were evaluated according to dietary intervention, it was found that the SD+MCT group spent the most time in the center, the least time in the periphery, and the lowest immobilization time (P < .05). In FST, the SD+KO with the highest weight gain was the most immobile group (P < .05). The study indicates that the weight-reducing effects of MCTs resulted in positive behavioral responses, particularly in OFT and FST. Through these properties, MCTs can be used medicinally in the prevention and treatment of behavioral changes due to depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a critical condition characterized by rapid liver dysfunction, leading to high mortality rates. Current treatments are limited, primarily supportive, and often require liver transplantation. This study investigates the potential of a novel nanoparticle formulation of glutathione (GSH) and virgin coconut oil (VCO) alone and in combination to enhance therapeutic outcomes in a rat model of ALF induced by orogastric carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). METHODS: The study employed adult male Albino rats divided into ten groups, with ALF induced via a single oral dose of CCl4. Various treatment regimens were administered over seven days, including conventional and nanoparticle forms of GSH and VCO and their combinations. The efficacy of treatments was evaluated through biochemical analysis of liver function markers, oxidative stress indicators, inflammatory biomarkers, and histopathological examinations. Nanoparticles were synthesized using established methods, and characterization techniques were employed to ensure their quality and properties. RESULTS: The nanoparticle formulations significantly improved liver function, as indicated by reduced serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, alongside decreased oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde. Furthermore, they reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta inflammatory markers. Histological analysis revealed reduced hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation in treated groups compared to controls. Also, decreased nuclear factor-kappa B was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. CONCLUSION: The findings show that the nanoparticle mixture of GSH and VCO effectively reduces liver damage in ALF. This suggests a promising drug-based approach for improving liver regeneration and protection. This innovative strategy may pave the way for new therapeutic interventions in the management of ALF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Monitoring noncommunicable diseases is regarded as a critical concern that has to be managed in order to avoid a wide variety of complications such as increasing blood lipid levels known as dyslipidemia. Statin drugs, mostly, Rosuvastatin (RSV) was investigated for its effectiveness in treating dyslipidemia. However, reaching the most efficient treatment is essential and improving the effect of RSV is crucial. Therefore, a combination therapy was a good approach for achieving significant benefit. Although RSV is hydrophobic, which would affect its absorption and bioavailability following oral administration, overcoming this obstacle was important. PURPOSE: To that end, the purpose of the present investigation was to incorporate RSV into certain lipid-based nanocarriers, namely, nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) prepared with virgin coconut oil (CCO). METHODS: The optimized RSV-NLC formula was selected, characterized and examined for its in vitro, kinetic, and stability profiles. Eventually, the formula was investigated for its in vivo hypolipidemic action. RESULTS: The optimized NLC formulation showed a suitable particle size (279.3±5.03 nm) with PDI 0.237 and displayed good entrapment efficiency (75.6±1.9%). Regarding in vitro release, it was efficiently prolonged for 24 h providing 93.7±1.47%. The optimized formula was established to be stable after 3 months storage at two different conditions; 4°C and 25°C. Importantly, including CCO in the development of RSV-NLC could impressively enhance lowering total cholesterol level in obese rat models, which endorse the potential synergistic action between RSV and CCO. CONCLUSION: The study could elucidate the impact of developing NLC using CCO for improving RSV anti-hyperlipidemic activity.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy Wistar albino rats (150-200 gm) were split into two groups: experimental group and control group. Based on stress exposure and treatment with VCO and antidepressants, they were further divided into various subgroups. A chronic, unpredictable stress procedure was given for 21 days. After the experimental procedure, the rats were anesthetized, and through a cardiac puncture, blood was collected. The liver and brain were dissected to estimate different biochemical markers. RESULTS: VCO proved to be a protective agent against chronic, unpredictable stress-induced changes in the biochemical parameters, hepatic enzyme activity, lipid profile, oxidative stress, and cognition. CONCLUSION: VCO might be helpful as an effective natural treatment that can be utilized to effectively combat chronic, unpredictable stress-induced changes in brain and liver tissue."

      "abstract": "In acute renal failure (ARF), the glomerular filtration rate is reduced, and nitrogenous waste products accumulate persistently, which can last anywhere from a few hours to several days. There is hope for a reversal of the rapid loss of renal function caused by this condition. This study, with gentamicin-induced acute ARF as a prospective setting, sets out to examine the reno-protective benefits of virgin coconut oil (VCO) and GSH. Furthermore, the study evaluated the effect of medication nanoparticle compositions on several kidney function markers. The induction of ARF is achieved with the intraperitoneal injection of gentamicin. To assess renal function, rats underwent 24 h of dehydration and hunger before their deaths. The study examined various aspects, including kidney function tests, markers of oxidative stress, histology of kidney tissue, inflammatory cytokines, immunohistochemistry expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and specific biomarkers for kidney tissue damage, such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). The results of our study indicated that the combination of VCO and GSH, using both regular and nanoparticle formulations, had a better protective impact on the kidneys compared to using either drug alone. The recovery of renal tissue and serum markers, which are symptomatic of organ damage, indicates improvement. This was also demonstrated by the reduction in tubular expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, KIM-1, and NGAL. The immunohistochemical studies showed that the combination therapy, especially with the nanoforms, greatly improved the damaged cellular changes in the kidneys, as shown by higher levels of NF-κB. The study shows that VCO and GSH, when administered individually or combined, significantly improve ARF in a gentamicin-induced rat model, highlighting potential therapeutic implications. Notably, the combined nanoparticulate formulations exhibit substantial effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "A recent pilot study in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients analyzed the effect of a Mediterranean diet (MeDi) supplemented with nicotinamide riboside (NR, a NAD+ promoter), pterostilbene (PTER, a natural antioxidant) and/or coconut oil on anthropometric variables in ALS patients. The results suggested that the MeDi supplemented with NR, PTER and coconut oil is the nutritional intervention showing the greatest benefits at anthropometric levels. Over the last 30 years, glucose intolerance has been reported in ALS patients. Thus, suggesting that an alternative source of energy may be preferential for motor neurons to survive. Ketone bodies (KBs), provided through a MeDi with a lower carbohydrate content but enriched with medium chain triglycerides, could be a therapeutic alternative to improve the neuromotor alterations associated with the disease. Nevertheless, the use of a coconut oil-supplemented diet, as potentially ketogenic, is a matter of controversy. In the present report we show that a MeDi supplemented with coconut oil increases the levels of circulating KBs in ALS patients."

      "abstract": "In a rare condition known as vaginal agenesis, the uterus (womb) may develop only partially or not at all, while the vagina fails to develop altogether. It is common to diagnose vaginal agenesis, when a female does not start menstruation at puberty. This is a prenatal disorder that may also be linked to bone or kidney issues. Mullerian agenesis, Mullerian aplasia, and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome are other names for the illness. Treatment modalities encompass surgical and nonsurgical interventions, including the utilization of prefabricated or customized vaginal stents for neovagina reconstruction and maintenance. This case report describes the development of a neovagina in a 27-year-old female diagnosed with vaginal agenesis, a characteristic of MRKH syndrome. A customized clear acrylic stent, designed to provide a resilient surface, serves as a straightforward and cost-efficient alternative for managing this condition. Significantly, it enhances patient's compliance and comfort during treatment, addressing both the physical and psychological ramifications of this congenital anomaly. This customized vaginal stent not only provides a practical solution but also contributes to enhancing the quality of life for individuals grappling with vaginal agenesis, thereby offering a promising avenue for addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with this condition."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of VCO as adjunctive therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label controlled trial involving laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at the Philippine General Hospital. The study participants were randomized to the intervention group who received virgin coconut oil with local standard of care, or to the control group who received local standard of care alone. RESULTS: We enrolled 39 participants into the VCO group and 38 participants into the control group. Significantly fewer participants in the VCO group had abnormal CRP levels at the end of treatment compared to control. (relative risk [RR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.95; p=0.02) No significant difference was found in the duration of hospital stay (mean 9.33 days for VCO vs. 10.29 days for control; p=0.45) and time to symptom resolution (mean 6.8 days for VCO, vs. 6.74 days for control; p=0.91). Although the proportion of patients who developed the secondary outcomes of mortality, need for ICU admission, need for invasive ventilation, and negative viral conversion was lower in the VCO group, results did not reach statistical significance. The VCO group had larger reduction in the inflammatory markers ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, TNF-alpha, IP-10 and IL-6, but results did not reach statistical significance. Adverse events were significantly higher in the VCO group (RR 4.87, 95% CI 1.14 to 20.79; p=0.03). CONCLUSION: This clinical trial on hospitalized patients showed significant benefit in CRP levels of participants given VCO compared to control. There was no significant benefit in the use of VCO as adjunctive therapy in reducing duration of hospital stay. Larger studies are needed to conclusively demonstrate the effect of VCO on other clinical outcomes and inflammatory markers."

A multimodal treatment intervention is the most feasible way to alter the course of AD progression. Hence, the current study was conducted to study the combination of betanin (BET) and virgin coconut oil (VCO) on NLRP3 regulation in aluminum chloride-induced AD in Wistar rats. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: BET (100,200 mg/kg) and VCO (1, 5 g/kg) alone and in combination (BET 100 mg/kg + VCO 1 g/kg and BET 200 mg/kg + VCO 5 g/kg) were given orally for 42 days. On day 21 and 42nd, the behavioral test was performed to check the animal's cognition. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative stress markers, estimation of NLRP3 and IL-1β, and histological examinations were conducted in the hippocampus (H) and cortex (C). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Treatment with BET and VCO alone or combined improved behavioral characteristics (MWM and PA p < 0.0001; EPM p = 0.5184), inhibited AChE activity (C, p = 0.0101; H, p < 0.0001), and lowered oxidative stress in the brain. Also, combination treatment restored the levels of NLRP3 (C, p = 0.0062; H, p < 0.0001) and IL1β (C, p = 0.0005; H, p = 0.0098). The combination treatment significantly reduced the degree of neuronal degeneration, amyloid deposition, and necrosis in the brain tissue. The current study revealed that the combination strategy effectively controlled neuroinflammation via modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, paving the way for the new treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Male infertility is a major public health issue due to increased prevalence, so there is an urgent need for a therapeutic solution. The search for a natural dietary substance that could modulate redox balance and inflammation and protect testicular function is in demand. Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) has found use in the treatment of diabetes, and cancer owing to the presence of polyphenols. However, there is a dearth of information on its effect on testicular toxicity. The present study investigated VCO as a possible treatment for testicular toxicity in the Sodium Benzoate (SB) model of male infertility by evaluating the oxidative and inflammatory status, circulating hormonal levels, and key sperm indices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty adult male rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 5 rats each and were treated with normal saline, sodium benzoate, sodium benzoate+5% VCO, and sodium benzoate+15% VCO for 30 days respectively. Biochemical analysis of reproductive hormones was assessed. Sperm parameters assessed include sperm function tests and sperm kinematics. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Tukey tests was performed. RESULTS: 5% VCO reverts the deranged serum reproductive hormones caused by sodium benzoate. 5% VCO was more potent as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatment than 15% VCO. However, both doses prevented SB's effect on the sperm function test and kinematics. CONCLUSION: VCO-supplemented diet can ameliorate SB-induced testicular toxicity by inhibiting its mechanisms of toxicity that are related to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation."

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing smart drug delivery systems based on natural resources combined with stimulus-sensitive elements. This trend aims to formulate innovative and sustainable delivery platforms tailored for topical applications. This work proposed the use of layer-by-layer (LbL) methodology to fabricate biocompatible photo-responsive multilayer systems. These systems are composed of a polyoxometalate inorganic salt (POM) ([NaP5W30O110]14-) and a natural origin polymer, chitosan (CHT). Curcumin (CUR), a natural bioactive compound, was incorporated to enhance the functionality of these systems during the formation of hollow capsules. The capsules produced, with sizes between 2-5µm (SEM), were further dispersed into CHT/VCO (virgin coconut oil) emulsion solutions that were casted into molds and dried at 37 °C for 48 h. The system presented a higher water uptake in PBS than in acidic conditions, still significantly lower than that earlier reported to other CHT/VCO-based systems. The drug release profile is not significantly influenced by the medium pH reaching a maximum of 37% ± 1% after 48 h. The antioxidant performance of the designed structures was further studied, suggesting a synergistic beneficial effect resulting from CUR, POM, and VCO individual bioactivities. The increased amount of those excipients released to the media over time promoted an increase in the antioxidant activity of the system, reaching a maximum of 38.1% ± 0.1% after 48 h. This work represents a promising step towards developing advanced, sustainable drug delivery systems for topical applications."

However, the use of lignocellulosic biomass is limited by the challenges of efficient degradation strategies. Given this need, Bacillus tropicus (B. tropicus) with cellulose degradation ability was isolated and screened from rotten dahlia. The strain efficiently utilized coconut oil cake (COC) to secrete 167.3 U/mL of cellulase activity. Electron microscopy results showed significant changes in the structure and properties of cellulose after treatment with B. tropicus, which increased the surface accessibility and the efficiency of the hydrolysis process. The functional group modification observed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated the successful depolymerization of COC. The X-ray diffraction pattern showed that the crystallinity index increased from 44.8% to 48.2% due to the hydrolysis of the amorphous region in COC. The results of colorimetry also reveal an efficient hydrolysis process. A co-culture of B. tropicus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to produce ethanol from COC waste, and the maximum ethanol yield was 4.2 g/L. The results of this work show that B. tropicus can be used to prepare biotechnology value-added products such as biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass, suggesting promising utility in biotechnology applications."

This study was set to investigate the impact of consuming diets with red palm olein (RPOO), extra virgin coconut oil (EVCO) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO, as a control) on cardiometabolic risk biomarkers and lipid profile. METHODS: We recruited a total of 156 individuals with central obesity, aged 25-45 years, with waist circumference ≥ 90 cm for men and ≥ 80 cm for women in a parallel single-blind 3-arm randomised controlled trial. The participants consumed isocaloric diets (~ 2400 kcal) enriched with respective test fats (RPOO, EVCO or EVOO) for a 12-week duration. RESULTS: The mean of the primary outcome plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein was statistically similar between the three diets after a 12-week intervention. EVOO resulted in significantly lower mean LDL cholesterol compared with RPOO and EVCO, despite similar effects on LDL and HDL cholesterol subfractions. The RPOO diet group showed elevated mean α and β -carotenes levels compared with EVCO and EVOO diet groups (P < 0.05), corresponding with the rich carotenoid content in RPOO. CONCLUSION: The three oils, each of which has unique phytonutrient and fatty acid compositions, manifested statistically similar cardiometabolic effects in individuals with central obesity at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases with distinct circulating antioxidant properties.

Twenty (20) male Wistar rats weighing 160-180g were divided into four (4) groups: Control which received 1ml of normal saline, SB-treated; received 200 mg/kg b.w, SB + Low Dose VCO-treated (SB + 5% VCO mixed with 95g of rat chow), and SB + High Dose VCO-treated (SB+ 15% VCO mixed with 85g of rat chow). The brain was processed for NRF-2, NF-kB, and acetylcholine esterase (AchE) gene expression levels. Also, the blood sample was processed for assessment of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and IL1B levels. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests were used to analyze data. SB-treated rats with no intervention showed anxiety-like behavior and impaired memory as depicted by a significant (p<0.0001) increase in anxiety index, increase in brain NF-KB, increase in serum IL1B and increase in AchE gene expression level, reduction in the recognition ratio, decreased spontaneous alternation performance, decreased CAT and SOD levels and decreased NRF-2 expression level when compared to other groups (especially control and SB + 5% VCO). VCO supplemented diet (both 5% and 15%) significantly (p<0.0001) increased the CAT and SOD levels, increased the NRF-2 gene expression level, and significantly (p <0.0001) decreased the IL1-B level. Moreover, 5% VCO significantly (p<0.0001) decreased the anxiety index, decreased AchE and NFkB gene expression levels, increased spontaneous alternation performance, and increased recognition ratio compared to 15% VCO. VCO shows a neuroprotective effect in attenuating cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behavior in SB-induced model by modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, and also enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During recent years several studies have investigated the impact of different dietary oils on body weight. They have shown differential positive and negative effects on anthropometry. We investigated the effects of palm and coconut oils on body weight and other anthropometric parameters, considering their importance as a primary source of saturated fat, controlling for other confounding variable such as total energy intake. METHODS: The study was conducted as a sequential feeding clinical trial with 40 healthy men and women divided into two feeding periods of initial palm oil (8 weeks) and subsequent coconut oil (8 weeks), with a 16-week washout period in between. Each participant received a pre-determined volume of each oil, which were integrated into their routine main meals and snacks during the respective study periods. Changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were evaluated. Physical activity levels and dietary intake were also evaluated as potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants completed both oil treatment periods. The mean (± SD) age of the participants was 39 (± 13.1) years. There were no significant differences in any of the anthropometric parameters between the initial point of feeding coconut oil and the initial point of feeding palm oil. Following both oil treatment phases, no significant changes in the subjects' body weight, BMI, or other anthropometric measurements (WC, HC, and WHR) were observed. CONCLUSION: Neither coconut oil nor palm oil significantly changed anthropometry-related cardiovascular risk factors such as body weight, BMI, WC, HC, and WHR.

CBM3 did not alter the pH and temperature optima of bi- and tri-chimeric enzymes but improved the pH and temperature stability of ManB in CBM variants of bi-/tri-chimeric enzymes. Truncation of CBM in CelB shifted the pH optimum and increased the melting temperature (Tm 65 ℃). CBM3 improved both substrate affinity (Km) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of fused enzymes in tri-chimera and CelB but only Km for bi-chimera. Far-UV CD of CelB and bi- and tri-chimeric enzymes suggested that CBM3 improved the α-helical content and compactness in the native state but did not prevent disintegration of secondary structural contents at acidic pH. Steady-state fluorescence studies suggested that under acidic conditions CBM3 prevented the exposure of hydrophobic patches in bi-chimeric protein but could not avert the opening up of chimeric enzyme structure. Aqueous enzyme assisted treatment of mature coconut kernel using single, bi- and tri-chimeric enzymes led to cracks, peeling and fracturing of the matrix and improved the oil yield by up to 22%.",

Fragments (6 x 6 x 2mm) of bovine teeth were sectioned and initial microhardness (KHN) and surface roughness (Ra) readings were obtained. The samples were submitted to cariogenic challenge to form white spot lesions and were separated into six groups (n=13): 1) Artificial Saliva (AS); 2) Coconut Oil (CO); 3) CO+2% Biosilicate (CO+2%Bio); 4) CO+5% Biosilicate (CO+5%Bio); 5) 2% Biosilicate Suspension (2% Bio) and 6) 5% Biosilicate Suspension (5% Bio). The treatments for 1 cycle/day were: immersion into the treatments for 5 minutes, rinsing in distilled water, and storage in artificial saliva at 37ºC. After 14 days, KHN and Ra readings were taken. The surface roughness alteration ((Ra) was analyzed (Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's post-test, p<0.05). CO+2%Bio had higher (p = 0.0013) (Ra followed by CO+5%Bio (p = 0.0244) than AS. The relative KHN and remineralization potential were analyzed (ANOVA, Tukey, p<0.05), and 5% Bio treatment presented a higher relative microhardness than all other groups (p>0.05). The remineralizing potential of all the treatments was similar (p > .05). When Biosilicate was added, the pH of the suspensions increased and the alkaline pH remained during the analysis. Biosilicate suspension is more efficient than the incorporation of particles into coconut oil at white spot lesion treatment. In addition to the benefits that coconut oil and Biosilicate present separately, their association can enhance the remineralizing potential of Biosilicate.",

Currently, the pathophysiology of PCOS is unclear, and the limited treatment options are unsatisfactory. Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is functional food oil associated with pharmacological effects in reproductive disorders. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether VCO could enhance clomiphene (CLO) therapy against PCOS in female rats. Rats were randomly divided: (1) Control, (2) PCOS model, (3) PCOS + CLO, (4) PCOS + VCO, and (5) PCOS + CLO + VCO. The PCOS was induced via daily letrozole (1 mg/kg, orally) administration for 21 days. After the PCOS induction, CLO, VCO, and CLO + VCO were administered from days 22 to 36. Serum levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin were estimated. Polymerase chain reaction gene expression for nuclear factor-erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GSR), LH receptor (LHr), androgen receptor (AR), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and caspase-3 were analyzed. The letrozole-induced PCOS caused considerable increases in GnRH, LH, prolactin, estrogen, and testosterone, whereas FSH decreased significantly compared to the control. The gene expression of Nrf2, HO-1, CAT, and GSR were markedly diminished, while IL-1β, TNF-α, caspase-3, AR, and LHr prominently increased compared to control. Interestingly, the CLO and VCO separately exerted anti-inflammatory and endocrine balance effects. However, VCO-enhanced CLO effect in LH, prolactin and testosterone, Nrf2, HO-1, CAT, GSR, and AR. VCO may synergize with CLO to depress hyperandrogenism and oxidative inflammation in PCOS.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by cognitive impairment. Although coconut oil has been shown to be potentially beneficial in reducing AD-related cognitive deficits, information on its mechanism of action is limited. Thus, we investigated the effects of coconut oil on spatial cognitive ability and non-cognitive functions in a rat model of AD induced by G-galactose (D-GAL) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3), and examined the changes in synaptic transmission, cholinergic activity, neurotrophic factors and oxidative stress in this process. The AD model was established by administering D-GAL and AlCl3 for 90 days, while also supplementing with coconut oil during this time. Cognitive and non-cognitive abilities of the rats were evaluated at the end of the 90-day supplementation period. In addition, biochemical markers related to the pathogenesis of the AD were measures in the hippocampus tissue. Exposure to D-GAL/AlCl3 resulted in a reduction in locomotor activity, an elevation in anxiety-like behavior, and an impairment of spatial learning and memory (P < 0.05). The aforementioned behavioral disturbances were observed to coincide with increased oxidative stress and cholinergic impairment, as well as reduced synaptic transmission and levels of neurotrophins in the hippocampus (P < 0.05). Interestingly, treatment with coconut oil attenuated all the neuropathological changes mentioned above (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that coconut oil shows protective effects against cognitive and non-cognitive impairment, AD pathology markers, oxidative stress, synaptic transmission, and cholinergic function in a D-GAL/AlCl3-induced AD rat model.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of VCO on cognition in people with AD and to determine the impact of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 genotype on cognitive outcomes. METHODS: Participants of this double-blind placebo-controlled trial (SLCTR/2015/018, 15.09.2015) were 120 Sri Lankan individuals with mild-to-moderate AD (MMSE = 15-25), aged > 65 years, and they were randomly allocated to treatment or control groups. The treatment group was given 30 mL/day of VCO orally and the control group, received similar amount of canola oil, for 24 weeks. The Mini-Mental Sate Examination (MMSE) and Clock drawing test were performed to assess cognition at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for lipid profile and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1 C) levels.∥Results:There were no significant difference in cognitive scores, lipid profile, and HbA1 C levels between VCO and control groups post-intervention. The MMSE scores, however, improved among APOE ɛ4 carriers who had VCO, compared to non-carriers (2.37, p = 0.021). APOE ɛ4 status did not influence the cognitive scores in the control group. The attrition rate was 30%.∥Conclusion:Overall, VCO did not improve cognition in individuals with mild-to-moderate AD following a 24-week intervention, compared to canola oil. However, it improved the MMSE scores in APOE ɛ4 carriers. Besides, VCO did not compromise lipid profile and HbA1 C levels and is thus safe to consume.",

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and coconut oil have been shown to be effective against dyslipidemia. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between lipid profiles, fat consumption, and functional disability in patients with MS after administering EGCG and coconut oil. METHODS: A four-month pilot study was conducted on 45 MS patients, divided into an intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG). The IG received 800 mg of EGCG and 60 mL of coconut oil. Lipid profiles were measured before and after the intervention, along with other data such as dietary habits, inflammatory markers, and functional capacity. RESULTS: Dyslipidemia did not correlate with the patients' fat consumption. After the intervention, triglycerides (TG) levels were lower in IG compared to CG. This decrease was positively correlated with an improvement in functional disability (determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)) and negatively with high-density cholesterol (HDL) and apolipoprotein A1. Significant and positive correlations were observed between EDSS and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the IG. These changes in the IG could be related to body fat decrease, whose percentage shows a positive correlation with CRP and TG levels, and a negative correlation with HDL levels. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS present a certain type of dyslipemia not associated with their nutritional habits. The administration of EGCG and coconut oil seems to decrease blood TG levels, which could explain the functional improvements."

Supplementation with the antioxidants nicotinamide riboside (NR) and pterostilbene (PTER) can combat associated oxidative stress. Additionally, coconut oil is an alternative energy substrate that can address mitochondrial dysfunction. The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of a Mediterranean Diet supplemented with NR and PTER and/or with coconut oil on the anthropometric variables of patients with ALS. A prospective, mixed, randomized, analytical and experimental pilot study in humans was performed through a clinical trial (registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under number NCT03489200) with pre- and post-intervention assessments. The sample was made up of 40 subjects categorized into four study groups (Control, Antioxidants, Coconut oil, and Antioxidants + Coconut oil). Pre- and post-intervention anthropometric assessments were carried out to determine the following data: weight, percentage of fat and muscle mass, skinfolds, body perimeters, Body Mass Index (BMI), Waste-to-Hip Index (WHI) and Waist-Height Ratio (WHR). Compared to the Control group, GAx significantly increased muscle mass percentage and decreased fat mass percentage, triceps, iliac crest, and abdominal skinfolds. GCoco significantly increased muscle mass percentage and decreased fat mass percentage, subscapular skinfolds, and abdominal skinfolds. GAx + coco significantly increased muscle mass percentage and decreased abdominal skinfolds. Therefore, our results suggest that the Mediterranean Diet supplemented with NR and PTER and the Mediterranean Diet supplemented with coconut oil (ketogenic diet) are the two nutritional interventions that have reported the greatest benefits, at anthropometric level."

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Parallel, double-blinded (outcome assessor and statistician), randomised controlled institution-based pilot study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 60 adults (18-22 years) having DMFT score of 2-11, gingival and plaque index as zero, no history of antibiotics for one month or fluoride application in 2 weeks were randomly divided (computer-generated list) and allocated into 3 groups (A-CHX, B-CEC, C-AT) of 20 subjects each based on the intervention. Oratest at baseline, days 15 and 30 were recorded. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Due to 5 dropouts on day 30, data were analysed based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. The difference in oratest scores (baseline vs. day 15 and 30) were found to be normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene's test). One way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used to determine the statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) between groups. RESULTS: Plaque and gingival index was zero throughout the study period. Difference in oratest scores was highest with CEC oil, followed by CHX and AT though there was no statistically significant differences between groups at baseline vs day 15 (P = 0.203) and baseline vs day 30 (P = 0.085) and between oils from baseline vs day 30 (P = 0.068). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the pilot study, both oils are comparable to CHX for their antiplaque and anticaries potential. Clinically, CEC was better than AT though statistical difference was not there.",

The focus of this research was to assess the effect of selected thermal and nonthermal pre-treatments on the yield and quality of subsequently wet-extracted VCO. The fresh coconut cream was subjected to microwave heating (450 W, 2 min), ohmic heating (180 V, 5 min), ultrasonication (350 W, 10 min), or a pulsed electric field (40 kV cm-1, 12.32 min). The thick cream was separated, and VCO was obtained after a freeze-thaw process. The highest VCO yields (>93%) were observed in the cases of ultrasonicated and pulsed electric field-treated samples. A range of oil quality parameters, total phenolic content, and antioxidants were evaluated. Further, the fatty acid composition of all oils was studied. Observations from this research indicate that ultrasonication pre-treatment resulted in the best VCO yield and quality."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cryptosporidiosis caused by Cryptosporidium sp. is a globally spreading disease. Nowadays, new researches are moving towards an effective treatment without side effects, especially for young and immune-compromised patients. The current study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the coconut oil extracts as an alternative medicinal plant in Cryptosporidium infected immunocompromised mice. METHODS: Sixty white albino mice were classified into six groups; Group I: Infected with Cryptosporidium oocysts treated with Nitazoxanide, Group II: Infected with Cryptosporidium oocysts and treated with coconut water extract, Group III: Infected with Cryptosporidium oocysts and treated with coconut Hexan extract, Group IV: Infected with Cryptosporidium oocysts and treated with coconut ethanol extract, Group V: Positive control, Group VI: Negative control. Stool samples were collected and examined; histopathological and immune-histochemical assessment using anti caspase-3 and anti CDX2 monoclonal antibodies were performed. RESULTS: Coconut oil extracts results revealed a significant decrease of oocyst count, correlated with an amelioration of histopathological and confirmed by immunohistochemical changes in ileal tissue. CONCLUSION: The present study has opened fresh avenues for development of natural therapy like coconut oil extracts, which have a potential therapeutic efficacy against Cryptosporidiosis. That was confirmed by different methodologies, parasitological examination, histopathological examination, and immunohistochemical assays. It paves the way for being a promising anti-parasitic agent for infection eradication. However, further studies are still required to gain more knowledge about different coconut extracts in order to reach the best treatment efficacy.",

Add-on therapy with an agent with a known safety profile may improve clinical outcomes, and virgin coconut oil (VCO) may be the candidate agent for improving the cardiometabolic profile. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of add-on VCO with atorvastatin in dyslipidemia in adults. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted on 150 patients with dyslipidemia who were randomized into control and test groups. The control group received atorvastatin monotherapy, whereas the test group received add-on VCO with atorvastatin for 8 weeks. At baseline, demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were assessed and repeated after 8 weeks of therapy. The main outcome measures were lipid profile, cardiovascular risk indices, 10-year cardiovascular risk, body fat compositions, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). RESULTS: The increase in HDL in the test group was significantly greater than in the control group (MD: 2.76; 95%CI: 2.43-3.08; p < 0.001). The changes in the atherogenic index (p = 0.003), coronary risk index (p < 0.001), cardiovascular risk index (p = 0.001), and TBARS (p < 0.001) were significantly greater in the test group. The decrease in LDL, total cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), were significantly higher in the control group. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to the changes in triglyceride, VLDL, and 10-year cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS: Add-on VCO (1000 mg/day) with atorvastatin (10 mg/day) can achieve a better clinical outcome in patients with dyslipidemia by increasing HDL and improving oxidative stress cardiovascular risk indices.",

A total of 192 un-sexed 7-days broiler chicks were divided into six treatment sets with four copies of 8 chicks per set. The groups were as follows: (1) basal diet (without additive), (2) basal diet plus 0.5 ml coconut essential oil/kg, (3) basal diet plus 1 ml coconut essential oil/kg, (4) basal diet plus 1.5 ml coconut essential oil/kg, (5) basal diet plus 2 ml coconut essential oil/kg and (6) basal diet plus 2.5 ml coconut essential oil/kg. The results showed that the most prevalent compound in coconut oil is 6-Octadecenoic acid (oleic acid) representing 46.44% followed 2(3H)-Furanone, dihydro-5-pentyl- (CAS) (11.36%), Hexadecanoic acid (CAS) (4.71%), and vanillin (2.53%). Dietary 1 and 1.5 ml of coconut oil improved significantly the body weight and gain of broiler chickens. Dietary supplementation of 1 ml of coconut oil improved significantly liver function compared to control and other treatment groups. The supplementation with 1 ml coconut oil significantly reduced TG and VLDL compared to control and other treatment groups, while no significant differences in TC, HDL, and LDL due to dietary coconut oil. The present findings showed that dietary coconut oil with 1 and 1.5 ml/kg feed improved significantly antioxidants status through increased antioxidant enzymes like SOD and GSH while decreasing significantly MDA levels compared to control and other treatment groups. Therefore, it was concluded that the diets of broiler chickens could be fortified with coconut oil with 1 or 1.5 ml to improve the growth, feed utilization, and antioxidant status of broiler chickens.",

Therefore, we aimed to reduce lauric acid content (∼30%) in VCO and evaluate its effect compared to VCO and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), on food intake, bodyweight (BW), lipid profiles, and hepatic histology. Female C57BL/6 mice were treated with different diets for 3 months: control (normal diet), high-fat diet (HF), HF + VCO, HF + MCT, HF + low lauric acid VCO (LLA), and normal diet + LLA (C + LLA). LLA was prepared by enzymatic interesterification of VCO with methyl octanoate (methyl caprylate) and methyl decanoate (methyl caprate). Plasma and liver lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride, were measured by colorimetric assay, and hepatic fat accumulation was examined by oil-red-O staining. HF mice exhibited high plasma and liver TC and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). VCO or MCT treatment lowered liver TC and LDL, whereas LLA increased plasma HDL and markedly improved TC:HDL ratio. The HF-induced hepatic fat accumulation was attenuated by all treatments, of which VCO was the most effective. Control mice administered with LLA demonstrated lower liver TC and LDL, but higher plasma TC and HDL compared to controls. Lowest BW gain and food intake were found in mice treated with LLA. In conclusion, VCO, MCT, and LLA ameliorated hepatic histopathology caused by HF. VCO and MCT improved liver lipid profiles, whereas LLA has more beneficial effect on plasma lipids via a better TC:HDL ratio and showed promise for BW control."

      "abstract": "Introduction The use of virgin coconut oil (VCO) as an over-the-counter (OTC) treatment for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia (VDD) in the general population has increased worldwide despite the absence of evidence-based studies supporting its efficacy. The principal objective of our pilot study was to scientifically validate the significant benefits and safety of using intra- and peri-vaginal application of VCO in paste form (VCOPF) for the treatment of VDD in patients with and without rheumatic autoimmune diseases (RAD). Additionally, multiple psychosocial, sexuality, and disease activity variables were also assessed.  Methods A survey study of patients with chronic VDD, with and without RAD, treated with a single proprietary brand of VCOPF via the 'CocoRelief' protocol continuously for at least six months in an outpatient rheumatology practice setting. We evaluated the comparison of group characteristics, treatment outcomes, and satisfaction questions by Fisher's exact test or chi-square test for independence for categorical variables and two-sample t-tests for continuous variables. Results Of the 53 respondents, 31 (58%) had an RAD and 22 (42%) did not. Rheumatoid arthritis and primary Sjogren's syndrome comprised 75% of the RAD group. The non-RAD cohort had both a higher baseline mean of intercourse pain (on a scale of 0-5) before VCOPF use (4.4 (SD 1.1) vs 3.9 (SD 1.0) (p = 0.094)) and a higher mean intercourse pain after VCOPF (2.0 (SD 1.3) vs 1.3 (SD 1.1) (p = 0.039)). VDD decreased by 55% in the non-RAD and 66% in the RAD population. Although not statistically significant (p = 0.195), VCOPF was at worst comparable to estrogen-containing therapies (ECT). No adverse events (AE) were documented. Conclusion A high percentage of women with VDD, with and without RAD, needlessly continue to experience quality-of-life-altering physical and psychosocial morbidity due to the underutilization and lack of awareness of VCO-containing therapy. The small sample size, non-blinded, non-randomized, pilot platform, and the use of a non-validated assessment tool represent the principal limiting factors. This study revealed that VCOPF, when used in paste form via the CocoRelief protocol, provided statistically significant long-term VDD-related efficacy not inferior to ECT without AE in patients with and without RAD. VCOPF is, therefore, likely to be a useful, cost-effective alternative in a substantial percentage of patients with and without RAD, particularly in women hesitant to utilize ECT due to cost and/or fear of adverse effects."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a protective role on the nervous system. Decreased levels of BDNF have been shown in MetS and neurodegenerative diseases. There is promising evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties of virgin coconut oil (VCO). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of VCO consumption on serum BDNF levels, oxidative stress status, and insulin resistance in adults with MetS. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 48 adults with MetS aged 20-50 years. The intervention group received 30 ml of VCO daily to substitute the same amounts of oil in their usual diet. The control group continued their usual diet. Serum BDNF levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as HOMA-IR and QUICKI index were measured after four weeks of intervention. RESULTS: VCO consumption significantly reduced serum levels of MDA (p = .01), fasting insulin (p < .01) and HOMA-IR index (p < .01) and increased serum TAC (p < .01) and QUICKI index (p = .01) compared to the control group. Serum BDNF levels increased significantly in VCO group compared to the baseline (p = .02); however, this change was not significant when compared to the control group (p = .07). CONCLUSION: VCO consumption improved oxidative stress status and insulin resistance and had a promising effect on BDNF levels in adults with MetS.

As there is no specific antidote, restoring cardiac hemodynamics is the cornerstone for saving patients. Based on oxidative stress theory in acute ALP poisoning, we examined the cardioprotective role of coconut oil and Coenzyme Q10 (COQ10) in ALP poisoning, focusing on their antioxidant capacity. This study was a randomized, controlled, single-blind, phase II clinical trial conducted at Tanta Poison Control Center over 1 year. Eighty-four ALP poisoned patients received supportive treatment and were randomly allocated to three equal groups. Gastric lavage was performed using sodium bicarbonate 8.4% with saline in group I. Alternatively, group II received 50 ml coconut oil, and group III initially received 600 mg CoQ10 dissolved in 50 ml coconut oil; and repeated 12 hours later. In addition to patient characteristics, clinical, laboratory, electrocardiography (ECG), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) data were recorded and repeated 12 hours later. Patient outcomes were evaluated. There was no significant difference among groups considering patient characteristics, initial cardiotoxicity severity, vital, laboratory data, ECG changes, and TAC. However, 12 hours post-admissions, group III was significantly improved in all clinical, laboratory, and ECG parameters than comparable groups. Significant correlations were observed between elevated TAC in groups II and III with hemodynamic, serum troponin, and ECG variables. Accordingly, the need for intubation, mechanical ventilation, and the total vasopressor dose was significantly decreased in group III compared with other groups. Therefore, coconut oil and COQ10 are promising cardioprotective adjuvant therapy ameliorating the ALP-induced cardiotoxicity."

      "abstract": "Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is a functional food with important health benefits. Its economic interest encourages fraudsters to deliberately adulterate VCO with cheap and low-quality vegetable oils for financial gain, causing health and safety problems for consumers. In this context, there is an urgent need for rapid, accurate, and precise analytical techniques to detect VCO adulteration. In this study, the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) methodology was evaluated to verify the purity or adulteration of VCO with reference to low-cost commercial oils such as sunflower (SO), maize (MO) and peanut (PO) oils. A two-step analytical procedure was developed, where an initial control chart approach was designed to assess the purity of oil samples using the MCR-ALS score values calculated on a data set of pure and adulterated oils. The pre-treatment of the spectral data by derivatization with the Savitzky-Golay algorithm allowed to obtain the classification limits able to distinguish the pure samples with 100% of correct classifications in the external validation. In the next step, three calibration models were developed using MCR-ALS with correlation constraints for analysis of adulterated coconut oil samples in order to assess the blend composition. Different data pre-treatment strategies were tested to best extract the information contained in the sample fingerprints. The best results were achieved by derivative and standard normal variate procedures obtaining RMSEP and RE% values in the ranges of 1.79-2.66 and 6.48-8.35%, respectively. The models were optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the most important variables and the final models in the external validations gave satisfactory results in quantifying adulterants, with absolute errors and RMSEP of less than 4.6% and 1.470, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disease that seriously affects the quality of life. Its pathophysiology is complex and includes neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is a natural food that has been found to have remarkable anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties. We assessed the effects of VCO on depression and the related mechanisms by performing network pharmacology analysis and evaluating depressive-like behaviors in rat model and found that VCO-treatment alleviated the depressive-like behaviors, inhibited microglial and astrocytic activation and reduced neuronal loss in the hippocampus, possibly by decreasing neuronal apoptosis. In addition, network pharmacology analysis and western blotting showed that VCO might exert neuroprotective effects by activating Protein Kinase B (AKT)-related pathway. Taken together, our results revealed the previously unrecognized effects of VCO on depression, and further explored the underlying mechanism of depression.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the treatment of coconut oil using thermosonic treatment in combination with green coffee beans. Under a defined ratio of coconut oil to green coffee beans, the effect of different thermosonic time on the quality parameters, active substance content, antioxidant capacity, and thermal oxidative stability of coconut oil were investigated as a strategy to potentially improve the quality of oil. Results showed that the β-sitosterol content of CCO (coconut coffee oil) treated with the thermal method combined with green coffee bean treatment reached up to 393.80 ± 11.13 mg/kg without affecting the lipid structure. In addition, DPPH clearance equivalents increased from 5.31 ± 1.30 mg EGCG/g to 71.34 ± 0.98 mg EGCG/g, and the ABTS clearance equivalent was 45.38 ± 0.87 mg EGCG/g versus 0 for the untreated sample. The improvement in thermal oxidation stability of treated coconut oil is also significant. The TG (Thermogravimetry) onset temperature was elevated from 277.97 °C to 335.08 °C and the induction time was elevated up to 24.73 ± 0.41 h from 5.17 ± 0.21 h. Thermosonic treatment in combination with green coffee beans is an ideal option to improve the quality of coconut oil. The results of this article provide new ideas for the development of plant-blended oil products and the new utilization of coconut oil and coffee beans."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammation of the large intestine characterized by diarrhea with blood. UC has a more extensive manifestation in children. Current therapy has not given satisfactory results. This is the basis for the need for preventive therapy to reduce the morbidity and mortality of UC in children. Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is a viable dietary supplement option due to its ability to act as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ligand, inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of this study was to determine natural compounds from VCO that have the potential to prevent colitis using a docking-based virtual screening approach. Quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis was used to find out how similar the input compounds and the database were. Docking is done using AutoDockTools 1.5.6. The algorithm used is the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (4.2). PPAR-gamma (PPAR-γ) was used as the target protein in a complex with rosiglitazone (ID PDB: 7AWC). PyMol 2.5.1 was used to prepare and visualize three-dimensional data, and the amino acid interactions were visualized using Discovery Studio 2021 Clients. It was found that linoleic acid and oleic acid in VCO have anti-inflammatory effects with predictive values of 0.73 and 0.614, respectively, and that they stop tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression with predictive values of 0.751 and 0.724. The result of molecular docking showed that the VCO compound was able to interact with the same residue as the control. VCO reduces inflammation by acting as a PPAR-γ and TNF expression inhibitor."

The antioxidant properties of SPHs were evaluated by measuring headspace oxygen consumption and conjugated diene formation in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. In addition, volatile profiles were analyzed for the heated mixture of SPHs and the coconut oil (SPHCO). Total amino acid content was the highest in double proteases. SPHs prepared from enzymes acted as better antioxidants than those prepared from acid/alkali treatments in O/W emulsions. SPHs prepared from double proteases generated the highest amounts of total volatiles and nitrogen-containing compounds in SPHCO. 2,3-Dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one, 2-methyl-butanal, benzeneacetaldehyde, and 2,6-dimethylpyrazine were the major volatiles in SPHCO. Enzymatic SPHs act as natural antioxidants in the O/W emulsion matrix, and thermal reaction products from SPHCO may contribute to the production of a unique volatile flavor in plant protein-based foods.

An in vivo study confirmed that virgin coconut oil (VCO) could maintain levels of lipids in the blood as effectively as conventional therapy. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of VCO on the lipid profiles and ankle-brachial index (ABI) of patients with DM. In this experimental study with pre- and post-test design and a control group, the participants were selected purposively. The ABI was evaluated on the first visit. Baseline lipid profile readings were taken. Each participant took 1.2 mL/kgBW of VCO daily and divided it into three doses. After 30 days of taking VCO, laboratory examinations and ABI were repeated, and adverse events were evaluated. The dependent t-test and Wilcoxon sign rank test with a significance level of α ≤ 0.05 showed a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (p = 0.002), a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (p = 0.031), a significant decrease in energy intake (p = 0.046) and cholesterol intake (p = 0.023) at the endpoint in the VCO group. In conclusion, this therapy is beneficial for maintaining lipid profile when combined with dietary therapy. Future studies should investigate the duration and dosage of VCO on patients to maintain lipid-linked protein.",

MetS is a cluster of systemic conditions that represent an increased chance of developing cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes in the future. C.O. has been the target of media speculation, and recent studies report inconsistent results. C.O. improved glucose homeostasis and reduced fat accumulation in Fructose-fed rats while decreasing the levels of triglycerides (TGs) in the liver. C.O. supplementation also increased TGs levels and fructosamine in serum during MetS, possibly due to white adipose tissue breakdown and high fructose feeding. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α were also increased in rats treated with Fructose and C.O. Oxidative stress marker nitrotyrosine is increased in fructose-fed animals, and C.O. treatment did not prevent this damage. No significant changes were observed in lipoperoxidation marker 4-Hydroxynonenal; however, fructose feeding increased total conjugated dienes and caused conjugated dienes to switch their conformation from cis-trans to trans-trans, which was not prevented by C.O. treatment. Potential benefits of C.O. have been reported with inconsistent results, and indeed we observed some benefits of C.O. supplementation in aiding weight loss, fat accumulation, and improving glucose homeostasis. Nonetheless, we also demonstrated that long-term C.O. supplementation could present some problematic effects with higher risk for individuals suffering MetS, including increased TGs and fructosamine levels and conformational changes in dienes.",

Objective: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of VCO and breast milk on nipple fissures in primiparous mothers. Design, Setting, Participants, and Intervention: A single-blind clinical trial was conducted with 106 breastfeeding primiparous mothers suffering from nipple fissures in health centers of Zarand, Kerman, from August 2020 to November 2020. The participants were selected randomly and allocated to two 60-member groups using block randomization. Mothers in the first group were asked to apply 0.5 mL of coconut oil on their nipples three times a day. Mothers in the second group were trained to apply three to four drops of their milk on their nipples after every breastfeeding session. The level of nipple fissures and pain intensity were examined using Storr's scale and visual analog scale, respectively. The results were analyzed using the chi-square test, repeated measures analysis of variance, and the independent samples t-test in SPSS 22. In this study, the significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results: Within-group comparisons revealed a significant difference between baseline scores and the scores on the 7th and 14th days (p < 0.001). Between-group comparison indicated no significant difference in nipple fissure (p = 0.419) and pain intensity (p = 0.405) at baseline. Nonetheless, there was a significant difference on the 7th day (pfissure = 0.002, ppain <0.001) and on the 14th day (pfissure <0.001, ppain = 0.036). Conclusion: Given its effect on nipple fissures, VCO may be used as a complementary substance to treat nipple fissures.

A total of 42 rats were divided into three groups of 14 animals each to receive the topical application of Aloe vera gel (AV group - n = 14), coconut oil (CO group - n = 14) and cold cream (CONT group - n = 14). The medical applications were performed twice a day in all the groups. The wound borders were marked on a transparent sheet every day. Afterwards, this sheet was transferred to the millimetre graph paper. On days 0, 7, and 14, the unhealed wound area was measured in all the groups. On days 7 and 14, seven rats in each group were euthanised. Then, skin samples including the intact skin were taken from the wound sites for histopathological and biochemical evaluations. The topical application of Aloe vera gel showed a significant increase in the healing process of the open wounds in terms of the clinical evaluation, histopathological and biochemical data averages when compared with the coconut oil and cold cream groups of rats (P < 0.05).

Thus, there is an alteration in the ability to walk that affects balance, speed and resistance. Since MS pathology involves neuroinflammation, cellular oxidation and mitochondrial alterations, the objective of the study was to assess the impact of a nutritional intervention with coconut oil and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on gait and balance. In order to do this, 51 patients with MS were enrolled and randomly distributed into an intervention group and a control group, which received either a daily dose of 800 mg of EGCG and 60 ml of coconut oil, or a placebo, all during a period of 4 months and which followed a Mediterranean isocaloric diet. Initial and final assessments consisted of the evaluation of quantitative balance (Berg scale), perceived balance (ABC scale), gait speed (10MWT) and resistance (2MWT). Besides, muscle strength was measured using a dynamometer and levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were measured in serum samples. In the intervention group, there was a significant improvement in the gait speed, quantitative balance and muscle strength of the right quadriceps; an improvement in gait resistance was observed in both groups. There were also significant and positive correlations between balance and gait scales. In conclusion, the administration of EGCG and coconut oil seems to improve gait speed and balance in MS patients, although the latter was not perceived by them. Furthermore, these variables appear to be related and contribute to functionality.",

Prophylactic diets before the onset of stroke have been implicated to work. In this research, the effects of virgin coconut oil (VCO) on stroke were evaluated using a stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) model. Eight-week-old SHRSPs were subjected to the repeated oral administration (5 mL/kg/day) of either 1% Tween 80 (group A) or VCO (group B). An early stroke onset was observed due to hypertension that was aggravation by the administration of 1% NaCl in water ad libitum. The following data were collected: the days until stroke occurred, the survival rate until the animal died, and blood pressure (BP) every two weeks using the tail-cuff method. After necropsy, the organs were harvested, and the brain was processed for a routine histopathological analysis. VCO delayed the incidence of it and prolonged their survival. Compared to group A, group B showed a significantly lowered BP by 20 mmHg at four weeks after the start of VCO treatment. Lastly, the brain histopathology showed that the structurally damaged areas were smaller in group B than they were in group A. The VCO could have protective effects on the brain before and even after stroke incidence."

      "abstract": "Coconut oil cake (COC), a byproduct of oil extraction, contains high levels of cellulose. The aim of this study was to isolate a cellulose-degrading yeast from rotten dahlia that can effectively use COC as the only carbon source for cellulase secretion. Based on screening, Meyerozyma guillermondii CBS 2030 (M. guillermondii) was identified as a potential candidate, with the highest cellulolytic activity among the yeast strains isolated, with the carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) activity reaching 102.96 U/mL on day 5. The cellulose in COC samples was evaluated before and after degradation by M. guillermondii. Analysis based on field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed that the COC structure was changed significantly during the treatment, indicating effective hydrolysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the modified functional groups indicated successful depolymerization of coconut cake. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and analysis of color differences established effective degradation of COC by M. guillermondii. The results demonstrate that M. guillermondii effectively secretes CMCase and degrades cellulose, which has important practical significance in COC degradation."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Enuresis is a common pediatric problem for which, no unique therapy has been suggested. The conventional therapy is effective, but fails in some cases. So, many parents try complementary medicine. Therefore, this study attempted to find if rubbing coconut oil is effective on improving enuresis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This double-blinded randomized clinical was conducted on 120 children aged 6 to 14 years with mono symptomatic nocturnal enuresis, from 2018 to 2019 in Yazd, Iran. The drug and placebo groups applied 6 drops of the coconut and paraffin oil topically on the suprapubic, sacral and flanks areas one time per night, respectively. Urination pattern was daily recorded for a period of 8 weeks by parents, and after one year, they were asked for any improvement by phone call. RESULTS: The mean frequency of enuresis at the first, second, fourth, and eighth week was lower in the intervention group (p<0.001); this difference between the groups remained after one year. Moreover, there was no side effect requiring any medical attention. CONCLUSION: Rubbing coconut oil is effective on improving symptom of primary mono symptomatic enuresis if applied every night for 4 weeks on suprapubic, sacral and flanks areas. This may be related to anticholinergic effect of the oil but its persistent effect for longer time after the end of application period, needs to be investigated in other studies."

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disease (ND) is a clinical condition in which neurons degenerate with a consequent loss of functions in the affected brain region. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most progressive ND after Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects the motor system and is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons from the nigrostriatal pathway in the midbrain, leading to bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, postural instability and non-motor symptoms such as cognitive declines, psychiatric disturbances, autonomic failures, sleep difficulties, and pain syndrome. Coconut oil (CO) is an edible oil obtained from the meat of Cocos nucifera fruit that belongs to the palm family and contains 92% saturated fatty acids. CO has been shown to mediate oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and excitotoxicity-induced effects in PD in various in vitro and in vivo models as a multi-target bioagent. CO intake through diet has also been linked to a decreased incidence of PD in people. During digestion, CO is broken down into smaller molecules, like ketone bodies (KBs). The KBs then penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and are used as a source of energy its ability to cross BBB made this an important class of natural remedies for the treatment of ND. The current review describes the probable neuroprotective potential pathways of CO in PD, either prophylactic or therapeutic. In addition, we briefly addressed the important pathogenic pathways that might be considered to investigate the possible use of CO in neurodegeneration such as AD and PD.",

Coconut milk was prepared by milling the pulp (5:1 water to coconut pulp ratio), further destabilised at pH 4 and centrifuged to obtain the cream and cream protein fractions (control process). Microwave-assisted treatment applied in milk (1 min, 3 pulses of 20 s; 2.5 GHz; 4.31 kW/kg by pulse) generated a significant increase in cream obtained, and in the coconut oil extraction yield (~ 20%) compared to its control. The ultrasound-assisted treatment (2.5 min; 24 kHz; 0.573 kW/kg, 6.85 W/cm2) also improved oil extraction (10-16%). Moreover, a higher protein yield was achieved in ultrasound treated samples when compared to their control (49.6-86.1%). Large particles of 11 m μ , probably aggregates of particles, and smaller particles of 3.6 m μ , were detected in coconut milk, which were reduced by ultrasound effect. Alternative treatments caused a greater liberation of total phenols in coconut cream. Coconut proteins in water (0.1%) showed high negative electrokinetic potential. The surface pressure of coconut proteins at the air/water interface was not modified by assisted treatments."

DESIGN: Randomised, crossover design. PARTICIPANTS: Metabolically healthy twenty male subjects (10 normal weight; 10 obese) aged 19-40 years. INTERVENTION: Subjects consumed breakfast meals containing skimmed milk, fat-free white cheese, bread and EVCO (25 g) or EVOO (25 g). OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analog scale evaluations, resting metabolic rate measurements and selected blood parameters analysis (glucose, triglyceride, insulin and plasma peptide YY) were performed before and after the test breakfast meals. In addition, energy intakes were evaluated by ad libitum lunch meal at 180 min. RESULTS: Visual analogue scale values of hunger and desire to eat decreased significantly after EVCO consumption than EVOO consumption in normal weight subjects at 180 min. There was an increase trend in plasma PYY at 30 and 180 min after EVCO breakfast compared to EVOO breakfast. Ad libitum energy intakes after EVCO and EVOO consumption in normal weight subjects were 924 ± 302; 845 ± 158 kcal (p = 0.272), respectively whereas in obese subjects were 859 ± 238; 994 ± 265 kcal (p = 0.069) respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study shows that consumption of EVCO compared to EVOO may have suppressive effect on hunger and desire to eat, may affect postprandial PYY levels differently and have no effect on postprandial energy expenditure.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite having a 92% concentration of saturated fatty acid composition, leading to an apparently unfavorable lipid profile, body weight and glycemic effect, coconut oil is consumed worldwide. Thus, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to analyze the effect of coconut oil intake on different cardiometabolic outcomes. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and LILACS for RCTs conducted prior to April 2022. We included RCTs that compared effects of coconut oil intake with other substances on anthropometric and metabolic profiles in adults published in all languages, and excluded non-randomized trials and short follow-up studies. Risk of bias was assessed with the RoB 2 tool and certainty of evidence with GRADE. Where possible, we performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We included seven studies in the meta-analysis (n = 515; 50% females, follow up from 4 weeks to 2 years). The amount of coconut oil consumed varied and is expressed differently among studies: 12 to 30 ml of coconut oil/day (n = 5), as part of the amount of SFAs or total daily consumed fat (n = 1), a variation of 6 to 54.4 g/day (n = 5), or as part of the total caloric energy intake (15 to 21%) (n = 6). Coconut oil intake did not significantly decrease body weight (MD -0.24 kg, 95% CI -0.83 kg to 0.34 kg), waist circumference (MD -0.64 cm, 95% CI -1.69 cm to 0.41 cm), and % body fat (-0.10%, 95% CI -0.56% to 0.36%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD -1.67 mg/dL, 95% CI -6.93 to 3.59 mg/dL), and triglyceride (TG) levels (MD -0.24 mg/dL, 95% CI -5.52 to 5.04 mg/dL). However, coconut oil intake was associated with a small increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD 3.28 mg/dL, 95% CI 0.66 to 5.90 mg/dL). Overall risk of bias was high, and certainty of evidence was very-low. Study limitations include the heterogeneity of intervention methods, in addition to small samples and short follow-ups, which undermine the effects of dietary intervention in metabolic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Coconut oil intake revealed no clinically relevant improvement in lipid profile and body composition compared to other oils/fats. Strategies to advise the public on the consumption of other oils, not coconut oil, due to proven cardiometabolic benefits should be implemented. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42018081461.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overweight individuals (n = 44, 19-30 years) without any chronic disease were included. In this randomized controlled crossover study, the participants were divided into two groups (Group 1: 23 people, Group 2: 21 people). In the first phase, Group 1 received diet therapy to lose 0.5-1 kg of weight per week and 20 mL of coconut oil/day, while Group 2 only received diet therapy. In the second phase, Group 1 received diet therapy while Group 2 received diet therapy and 20 mL of coconut oil/day. Anthropometric measurements were taken four times. Irisin was measured four times by enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) method and other biochemical findings were measured twice. Statistical analysis was made on SPSS 20. RESULTS: The irisin level decreased significantly when the participants only took coconut oil (p ≤ 0.05). There was a significant decrease in the participants' body weight, body mass index (BMI) level and body fat percentage (p ≤ 0.01). Insulin, total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) levels of all participants decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.05). There was no significant difference in irisin level due to body weight loss (p ≤ 0.05); coconut oil provided a significant decrease in irisin level (p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Diet therapy and weight loss did not have an effect on irisin level, but coconut oil alone was found to reduce irisin level. Coconut oil had no impact on anthropometric and biochemical findings.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is related to various respiratory diseases, and this affects the respiratory immune system. Alveolar macrophages (AMs), which are defenders against pathogens, play a key role in respiratory inflammation through cytokine production and cellular interactions. Coconut oil demonstrates antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and it is consumed worldwide for improved health. However, reports on the protective effects of coconut oil on the PM-induced respiratory immune system, especially in AMs, are limited. In this study, we generated artificial PM (APM) with a diameter approximately of 30 nm by controlling the temperature, and compared its cytotoxicity with diesel exhaust particles (DEP). We also investigated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of coconut oil in APM− and DEP−stimulated AMs, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that APM and DEP had high cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner in AMs. In particular, APM or DEP at 100 μg/mL significantly decreased cell viability (p < 0.05) and significantly increased oxidative stress markers such as reactive oxygen species (p < 0.01); the GSSH/GSH ratio (p < 0.01); and cytokine production, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (p < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-1β (p < 0.001), and IL-6 (p < 0.001). The expression of the genes for chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-1 (p < 0.05) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (p < 0.001); and the proteins toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (p < 0.01), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p < 0.001), p38 (p < 0.001); and extracellular receptor-activated kinase (p < 0.001), were also upregulated by PM. These parameters were reversed upon treatment with coconut oil in APM− or DEP−stimulated AMs. In conclusion, coconut oil can reduce APM− or DEP−induced inflammation by regulating the TLR4/MAPK pathway in AMs, and it may protect against adverse respiratory effects caused by PM exposure.",

Virgin coconut oil (VCO) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) are plant-based oil that is rich in antioxidants. This study examined the protective effects of VCO and EVOO combination to reduce DOX acute cardiotoxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five male rats (180-200 g) were divided into the following groups: Group I as a control, group II was given DOX i.p. injection of 25 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), group III to V received peroral administration of either VCO, EVOO or VCO-EVOO (1:1) combination at a dose of 10 mL/kg b.w. for 6 days before receiving DOX i.p. injection. After 24 hours from DOX injection, blood samples and organs were collected. Cardiac biomarkers, such as serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) were analyzed followed by histopathological examination. RESULTS: The administration of EVOO alone was found to reduce the marked elevation of SGOT, LDH, and CKMB levels in DOX-treated rats (p<0.05), while VCO administration only significantly reduced LDH and CKMB levels. However, when both oils were used in combination, the protective effect was shown to be more powerful since all cardiac biomarker levels were maintained at near-normal levels (p<0.05). Histopathological analysis showed a significant improvement in the myocardial tissue structures after pre-treatment with VCO-EVOO combination. CONCLUSION: The administration of VCO and EVOO in combination was superior to elicit protection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity compared to their individual application in rats."

Also the antioxidant capacity of Coconut Oil for various concentrations was assessed on the basis of percent scavenging of (DPPH) free radical. Experimental animals were divided into five groups, eight rabbits in each group. These were: group A (Normal control), group B (Toxic control), group C (Standard control), group D (Treated with Coconut Oil 50 mL/kg body weight after CCl4 intoxication), group E (Treated with Coconut Oil 200 mL/kg body weight after CCl4 intoxication). The effects observed were compared with a standard hepatoprotective drug silymarine (50 mL/kg body weight). The Coconut Oil (200 mL/kg body weight) significantly (P<0.05) reduced the elevated serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) when compared to a toxic control rabbits. The results of extract treated rabbits were similar to silymarine administered rabbits group. Treatment with Coconut Oil root and silymarine caused no significant changes in RBC, Platelets, (Hb), (MCH) concentration and (HCT) values. However, significant (P<0.05) increase was observed in the total WBC count.

We evaluated the patterns, reasons and beliefs related to coconut oil consumption and its perceived benefits in an online survey of a population in southern Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a before-and-after study using an 11-item online questionnaire that evaluated coconut oil consumption. In the same survey, participants who consumed coconut oil received an intervention to increase literacy about the health effects of coconut oil intake. We obtained 3160 valid responses. Among participants who consumed coconut oil (59.1%), 82.5% considered it healthy and 65.4% used it at least once a month. 81.2% coconut oil consumers did not observe any health improvements. After being exposed to the conclusions of a meta-analysis showing that coconut oil does not show superior health benefits when compared to other oils and fats, 73.5% of those who considered coconut oil healthy did not change their opinion. Among individuals who did not consume coconut oil, 47.6% considered it expensive and 11.6% deemed it unhealthy. CONCLUSIONS: Coconut oil consumption is motivated by the responders' own beliefs in its supposed health benefits, despite what scientific research demonstrates. This highlights the difficulty in deconstructing inappropriate concepts of healthy diets that are disseminated in society.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Virgin coconut oil is a natural product from coconut that has many benefits such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant. Inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissues has a high prevalence worldwide. The main etiology of periodontitis plaque of biofilm contains colonies of pathogenic microorganisms. The occurrence of inflammation in the periodontal tissue stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and TGF-β. Treatment for periodontitis can be performed starting from initial therapy and usually accompanied by additional therapy such as local drug delivery. VCO can be used as an alternative to antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of VCO gel on periodontal tissue regeneration materials through the expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1. METHODS: This is an experimental laboratory with a posttest-only control group design. VCO was made from grated fresh coconut and then mixed with NaCMC to obtain gel viscosity. The subjects of this study were 30 male periodontitis-induced Wistar rats by injecting Porphyromonas gingivalis into the gingival sulcus. Wistar rats were then divided into 3 groups. On the 7th and 14th days, the rats were sacrificed and the jaw was sampled to determine the amount of TNF-α and TGF-β1 expression in the regenerative process of periodontal tissue. RESULT: The amount of TNF-α and TGF-β1 increased significantly in the treatment group, but not as much as the increase in the positive control and negative control groups. CONCLUSION: VCO gel can affect the expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in the regeneration process of periodontal tissue in periodontitis-induced rats."

The estimation of the thermal properties of medicinal oils is essential for practical applications. OBJECTIVE: The present work aims to expound the ability of medicinal oils for the acclimatization of body temperature by determining its thermal diffusivity and thereby providing a validation to the traditional knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medicinal oils are prepared by incorporating black pepper (Piper nigrum), aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis), hibiscus bud (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) and Ocimum sanctum in coconut oil base. The samples are subjected to thermal diffusivity study using the mode-mismatched dual-beam thermal lens technique. RESULTS: The study reveals that the incorporation of black pepper (Piper nigrum), having hot potency (Ushna veerya), to the base fluid lowers the thermal diffusivity value, suggesting its potential in heat-trapping. The addition of aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis), hibiscus bud (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), and O. sanctum dissipates heat energy quickly, thus increases the thermal diffusivity of coconut oil revealing a cold potency (Sheeta veerya). The study provides a validation for traditional knowledge and delineates the possiblity of thermal diffusivity tuning of the base fluids. CONCLUSION: The thermal diffusivity tuning through incorporation of herbal extracts can effectively be used to acclimatize the human body temperature with the surroundings. A higher thermal diffusivity value induces a cooling effect and the lower value causes heating effect. This, opens up the possibility of using thermally tuned oils depending on climate and geographical location."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: GABA and glutamate neurotransmission play critical roles in both the neurobiology of depression and cognition; and Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is reported to support brain health. The present study investigated the effect of VCO on depression-associated cognitive deficits in mice. METHODS: Thirty male mice divided into five groups were either exposed to chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) protocol for 28 days or pre-treated with 3 mL/kg b. wt. of VCO for 21 days or post-treated with 3 mL/kg b. wt. of VCO for 21 days following 28 days of CUMS exposure. Mice were subjected to behavioural assessments for depressive-like behaviours and short-term memory, and thereafter euthanised. Hippocampal tissue was dissected from the harvested whole brain for biochemical and immunohistochemical evaluations. RESULTS: Our results showed that CUMS exposure produced depressive-like behaviours, cognitive deficits and altered hippocampal redox balance. However, treatment with VCO abrogated depression-associated cognitive impairment, and enhanced hippocampal antioxidant concentration. Furthermore, immunohistochemical evaluation revealed significant improvement in GABAA and mGluR1a immunoreactivity following treatment with VCO in the depressed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, findings from this study support the dietary application of VCO to enhance neural resilience in patients with depression and related disorders.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by the loss of muscle throughout the course of the disease, which in many cases is accompanied by obesity and related to inflammation. Nonetheless, consuming epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and ketone bodies (especially β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB)) produced after metabolising coconut oil, have exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and a decrease in body fat. In addition, butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), seems to be related to the pathogenesis of the disease associated with inflammation, and serum concentrations have been related to lipid metabolism. Objective. The aim of the study was to determine the role of BuChE in the changes caused after treatment with EGCG and ketone bodies on the levels of body fat and inflammation state in MS patients. (2) Methods. A pilot study was conducted for 4 months with 51 MS patients who were randomly divided into an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group received 800 mg of EGCG and 60 mL of coconut oil, and the control group was prescribed a placebo. Fat percentage and concentrations of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BuChE), paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity, triglycerides, interleukin 6 (IL-6), albumin and βHB in serum were measured. (3) Results. The intervention group exhibited significant decreases in IL-6 and fat percentage and significant increases in BuChE, βHB, PON1, albumin and functional capacity (determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)). On the other hand, the control group only exhibited a decrease in IL-6. After the intervention, BuChE was positively correlated with the activity of PON1, fat percentage and triglycerides in the intervention group, whereas these correlations were not observed in the control group (4). Conclusions. BuChE seems to have an important role in lipolytic activity and the inflammation state in MS patients, evidenced after administering EGCG and coconut oil as a βHB source.",

METHODS: This clinical observer-masked, randomized, crossover designed study involved 24 participants. The participants received professional prophylaxis in the preparatory period and after that subjects started to use the allocated mouthrinse (coconut oil or sesame oil). On day 5, periodontal clinical parameters including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), stain index (SI) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Subjects underwent a 14-day wash out period and then used the other mouthrinse for 4 days. RESULTS: Oil pulling therapy with coconut oil or sesame oil exhibited similar plaque regrowth inhibition (PI = 1.60 ± 0.28 and 1.49 ± 0.22, for oil pulling with coconut oil and sesame oil, respectively) and tooth staining (SI = 0.20 ± 0.11 and 0.21 ± 0.09, for oil pulling with coconut oil and sesame oil, respectively.) In addition, GI and BOP were similar in both groups (GI = 0.61 ± 0.19 and 0.69 ± 0.16; BOP = 0.09 ± 0.24 and 0.03 ± 0.03 for oil pulling with coconut oil and sesame oil, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Oil pulling therapy with coconut or sesame oil showed similar results in terms of plaque regrowth inhibition and tooth staining. According to the present results, both coconut oil and sesame oil can be used for oil pulling therapy with the aim of plaque regrowth inhibition.",

OBJECTIVE: (1) To quantify skin damage with increased usage frequency of ABHS by consumers and (2) To evaluate Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) as natural prophylactic agent to counter the adverse effects. METHODS: In-home usage study was carried out with 60 volunteers for a 15-day intervention-Control Group: 6 applications per day of ABHS and Test Group: Overnight VCO use (6-8 drops) followed by 6× usage per day of ABHS. This leg included dermatological evaluation and WHO Self-Assessment Scale for skin health. Another leg of measurement included non-invasive instrumental study (Moisture & TEWL Probes, Tape Strip for protein content and IR spectroscopy for protein & lipid content) on forearm of 12 subjects (25-60 years age) with and without VCO application and repeated alcohol exposure. RESULTS: In-home usage study established consumer experiencing skin protective effect of VCO in the context of ABHS onslaught. 25% increase in perceived moisture content was recorded for VCO users, using WHO Self-Assessment Scale. Instrumental studies confirmed an increase in TEWL and decrease in lipids & protein content. Overnight VCO application resists the extraction which builds up with repeated application. CONCLUSIONS: Current work provides evidence of compromised hand skin barrier with ABHS daily usage. Overnight VCO application helps prepare the skin for next day alcohol use. Based on the findings, a regimen of overnight VCO application on hands as a natural prophylactic is recommended.",

Recently a metagenomic study of the Indian scalp microbiome described an imperative role of bacterial commensals in providing essential vitamins and amino acids to the scalp. Coconut oil and its formulations are commonly applied on the scalp in several parts of the world to maintain scalp health. Thus, in this study we examined the effect of topical application of coconut oil on the scalp microbiome (bacterial and fungal) at the taxonomic and functional levels and their correlation with scalp physiological parameters. A 16-weeks-long time-course study was performed including 12-weeks of treatment and 4-weeks of relapse phase on a cohort of 140 (70 healthy and 70 dandruff) Indian women, resulting in ~ 900 metagenomic samples. After the treatment phase, an increase in the abundance of Cutibacterium acnes and Malassezia globosa in dandruff scalp was observed, which were negatively correlated to dandruff parameters. At the functional level, an enrichment of healthy scalp-related bacterial pathways, such as biotin metabolism and decrease in the fungal pathogenesis pathways was observed. The study provides novel insights on the effect of coconut oil in maintaining a healthy scalp and in modulating the scalp microbiome.",

Therefore, we systematically summarized all high-quality evidence on the usage of coconut oil for health-related benefits from SRs and MA. METHODS: PubMed®, Web of science®, SciVerse Scopus®, and EMBASE® databases were systematically searched to select SRs and SRs with MA of interventional studies reporting health-related clinical outcomes of coconut oil. Similar studies were grouped based on their respective clinical areas. A methodological quality appraisal was conducted for all included SRs and SRs with MA using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: A total of seven papers were selected for inclusion in this review, consisting of three MA and one SR on cardio-metabolic health, one SR on oral health, and one SR and one MA each on skin health. Coconut oil significantly increases serum total cholesterol, low-density- and high-density- lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared to poly- and mono-unsaturated oils. Limited studies showed that topical use of coconut oil helps in the prevention and treatment of atopic dermatitis and oil pulling for the prevention of dental caries. All four studies on cardiometabolic health and the SR on oral health had a high score in the quality assessment, SR with MA on skin health fulfilled high-quality scoring whereas the SR on the same topic had a low-quality scoring. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, consistent and strong evidence shows that coconut oil has an adverse effect on the lipids parameters associated with cardio-metabolic health, with limited studies to conclude the effects of atopic dermatitis and oil pulling.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is some promising evidence regarding the beneficial effect of coconut oil on cardiometabolic risk factors. This study aimed to assess the effects of virgin coconut oil (VCO) consumption on metabolic syndrome (MetS) components, as well as, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in adults with MetS. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized controlled trial, 48 subjects, aged 20-50 years, with MetS were allocated into two groups; the intervention group was given 30 ml of VCO per day to substitute the same amounts of fat in their usual diet for four weeks. The control group was advised to follow their usual diet. VCO consumption significantly reduced serum levels of triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.001), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) (P = 0.001), and fasting blood sugar (FBS) (P = 0.015) compared to the control group. The levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and total cholesterol (TC) were significantly increased in the VCO group when compared to the control group (P = 0.001). Circulatory ADMA also increased in the VCO group compared to the control group (P = 0.003). No significant differences were observed in the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, anthropometric parameters, and blood pressure measurements between the two groups at the end of the study (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: VCO consumption increased the values of HDL-C while reduced TG and FBS levels. Blood pressure and waist circumference did not change. However, levels of TC, LDL-C, and ADMA elevated by VCO consumption. Caution is warranted until the results of further studies become available to explain the long-term effects of VCO consumption.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of liver disease is increasing year by year and it is recognized as a main health burden across the world. Nowadays, dietary nutraceuticals are found to be very effective in the prevention and treatment of liver diseases. The virgin coconut oil and phosphatidylcholine are found to have a wide range of therapeutic efficacy and the most important among them is its hepatoprotective activity. In the present study, we had evaluated the hepatoprotective effect of the novel formulation with the combination of these two which is named as Phoscoliv. For the study, adult Wistar rats were grouped into Normal control, Paracetamol-treated, and Paracetamol along with Phoscoliv-treated group. In order to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of the drug, various parameters were analyzed. Data obtained from the study showed that Phoscoliv supplementation were found to significantly boost up the antioxidant status by enhancing the SOD, CAT, GPx, and GSH level and thereby inhibit the generation of ROS and also blocked lipid peroxidation, which was confirmed by the reduced level of TBARS. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was also decreased, which was eventually helped to maintain the normal architecture of the liver. Thus, from the overall result of this study reveals that Phoscoliv can be effectively used as a potent and safe hepatoprotective medicine. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The over or unwanted usage of synthetic medicine is a serious problem because it can cause so many adverse health effects. Liver-related disorders are the major side effects of these drugs. Food habits of ancient people dictate that there is no other better medicine than a good food. So, treating a disease with a food or compounds derived from a food item will be more effective. Virgin coconut oil is a type of natural and organic oil, which has the capability of maintaining the body in a healthy state. Likewise, phosphatidylcholines are very important phospholipid nutrients necessary to keep the cells healthy. Both these have the potential to protect and prevent the liver damages. Therefore, the combination of these two can exhibit profound hepatoprotective activity.",

      "abstract": "The study investigated amelioration effects of coconut oil (CO) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and blood metabolites in Hainan Black goat kids. Twenty-four Hainan Black goat kids (10 days of age) were assigned randomly to four treatments for 90 days, including pre-weaning (10-70 d of age) and post-weaning (70-100 d of age) days. The treatment regimens were control (CON), low CO (LCO), medium CO (MCO), and high CO (HCO) with 0, 4, 6, 8 g CO per goat per day, respectively. During the pre-weaning period, the average daily gain (ADG) linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05), whereas the average daily feed intake (ADFI) linearly decreased, and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) also decreased linearly and quadratically by increasing CO supplementation (P < 0.05). During the post-weaning period, increasing CO supplementation linearly and quadratically increased the BW at 100 days and ADG (P < 0.05), but quadratically decreased the ADFI and FCR (P < 0.05). The digestibility of ether extract (EE) linearly and quadratically increased with increasing CO supplementation (P < 0.05). Supplementation of CO linearly increased ruminal pH (P < 0.05), but linearly decreased (P < 0.05) ammonia-N, total VFAs, molar proportions of acetate, ruminal microbial enzyme activity of carboxymethyl-cellulase, cellobiase, xylanase, pectinase and α-amylase, and number of total protozoa, the abundance of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Prevotella ruminicola, and Ruminobacter amylophilus. The estimated methane emission decreased linearly and quadratically with increasing CO addition (P < 0.05). The serum concentration of triglycerides (TG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and growth hormone (GH) linearly (P < 0.05) increased by raising the CO supplementation. The present results indicate that CO supplementation at 6 g/day per goats is optimum due to improved growth performance and decreased estimated methane emission. Supplementation CO up to 8 g/day depressed growth and feed conversion due to its suppression of growth performance, rumen protozoa, cellulolytic bacteria and microbial enzyme activity, and reduced ADF and ADF digestibility."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coconut oil, a saturated fat comprised mostly of the medium-chain fatty acid, lauric acid, has become increasingly popular over the past few decades due to its touted anti-inflammatory, metabolic, and lipid-lowering properties. There have been many studies with mixed results evaluating the effects of coconut oil consumption on lipid metabolism and cardiometabolic risk. However, the effects on glucose metabolism are less clear. There are few trials on the effects of coconut oil on glucose homeostasis but no case reports prior to the current one. CASE: We present a case of a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes managed with insulin who developed recurrent hypoglycemia and required reduction in insulin therapy quickly after consuming coconut oil supplementation. CONCLUSION: This is the first known case report of coconut oil supplementation in a diabetic patient on insulin resulting in hypoglycemia. Review of the literature shows that coconut oil supplementation can have a favorable effect on glycemic control, possibly through phenolic compounds mediating anti-inflammatory effects. This effect is inconsistent throughout the studies reviewed, likely due to variations in types of coconut oil supplementation and scarcity of trials. Further research is required both in animal models and in humans before coconut oil intake is widely advised and popularized. This is especially true in patients with diabetes, who are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and in whom reduction in saturated fat intake is advised."

There is no evidence in support of coconut derivative-based products sold to treat pediculosis. This study was designed to test one such product. METHODS: This was an open-label clinical study in 31 people. The treatment was shampoo containing 1% fractionated coconut oil. Treatment was given on day 0 and day 8. Efficacy was measured using a detection comb on day 1, day 8 and day 16 after the first treatment. The trial was registered in the current controlled trials database, under number ISRCTN79136319. RESULTS: The first application of the product eliminated the lice from 7/31 participants, and 12/31 (38.7%) people had no lice at the end of the study. Lice of all development stages were found post treatment at all assessments on one or more participants. This indicates that the treatment failed to kill all stages of the life cycle of head lice. CONCLUSION: Two applications of the modified coconut shampoo were not effective at killing head lice or their eggs. The results confirm other studies that show little intrinsic activity in vegetable oils and modified oils. Most of the activity in shampoos is probably due to other product components, such as high levels of detergents.",

      "abstract": "Burn wound healing is a complex process that involves the repair of injured tissues and the control of infection to diminish the scar formation, pain, and discomfort associated with such injuries. The aim of this research was to formulate and optimize a self-nanoemulsion drug delivery system based on the use of coconut oil and loaded with simvastatin. Coconut oil possesses antiinflammatory and antibacterial activity, and simvastatin has interesting properties for promoting the wound-healing process because it increases the production of the vascular endothelial growth factor at the site of injury. The Box-Behnken design was employed for the optimization of the coconut oil-simvastatin self-nanoemulsion drug delivery system. The prepared formulations were characterized according to globular size and their activity in the healing of burn wounds by assessing the mean wound diameter and level of interlukin-6 in experimental animals. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of the prepared formulations was assessed. The nanoemulsion was considered adequately formed when it had droplets of between 65 and 195 nm. The statistical design proved the important synergistic effect of coconut oil and simvastatin for burn wound management in their synergistic potentiation of wound closure and their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. The optimum formulation achieved up to a 5.3-fold decrease in the mean burn wound diameter, a 4.25-fold decrease in interleukin-6 levels, and a 6-fold increase in the inhibition zone against Staphylococcus aureus when compared with different control formulations. Therefore, the designed nanoemulsions containing a combination of coconut oil and simvastatin could be considered promising platforms for the treatment of chronic and burn wounds."

This study aimed to explore the effect of coconut oil ingestion on the gastrointestinal microbiomes of pigs. A 14-day-long feeding experiment included 19 pigs in two groups (9 on a normal diet and 10 on a diet supplemented with coconut oil). At the start and end of the experiment, a rectal swab sample was taken from each pig in both groups, and total bacterial DNA was extracted. We used 16S rRNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing to evaluate the microbiome changes during the feeding experiment. A total of 446 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected in the whole sample set. Shannon's indices of bacterial diversity did not change significantly during the experiment. Changes in the bacterial community during the study period and in response to the coconut oil treatment were highly significant (p < 0.001). During the study, an increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus was detected in the group treated with coconut oil. An increase in Alloprevotella, Bifidobacteriales, and Lactobacillales and a decrease in Corynebacterium, Mitsuokella, Psychrobacter, and Pseudomonadales were attributed to the coconut oil treatment. Although the addition of coconut oil to pig feed did not affect Shannon's index of diversity, it had a positive effect on the abundance of bacterial groups that are considered to be commensal and/or probiotic."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  A sample of 20 patients was divided into two groups: a study and a control group. In the study group, coconut oil, in form of mouthwash, was administered to a sample of patients affected by gingivitis, aged between 18 and 35. The protocol established a daily application of the product for 30 days, where clinical parameters for plaque formation and gingivitis-plaque index (PI), bleeding index (BI)-will be evaluated during the recalls on a specific periodontal chart. The control group did not associate a coadjuvant to the normal daily oral health procedures and the same clinical parameters were evaluated at t0 and after 30 days (t1). The data were statistically analyzed using Student's t-test, establishing the significance level as p < 0.05. RESULTS:  PI and BI decreased in both groups, with a more relevant and significant drop in the study group, from a mean value of PI of 58.0 to 19.3 and a mean value of BI of 33.5 to 5.0. In the control group, the values decreased, respectively, from 53.9 to 29.1 for PI, and from 33.5 to 16.2. Furthermore, no significant side effect was reported during coconut oil pulling therapy. CONCLUSIONS:  The collected data showed significant and promising improvements in reducing plaque formation and gingivitis. However, further researches have to be performed to have more consistent and statistically significant data on larger samples and to fully understand the mechanisms of action and effectiveness."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is a common complication following radiation therapy for head and neck cancer (HNC), for which there is no single, universally accepted therapy. Coconut oil has been anecdotally suggested to provide relief for this complication. This study sought to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of coconut oil as a therapy for radiation-induced xerostomia. METHODS: A feasibility study was performed among 30 patients with xerostomia subsequent to radiation for HNC. Coconut oil samples were provided along with a protocol for use over a 2-week period and the option to continue if they found it beneficial. Patients were also instructed to keep diaries to document their patterns of use. The Xerostomia-related Quality of Life Scale (XeQOLS) was administered at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Descriptive methods were used to summarize patterns of coconut oil use and paired t-tests were used to assess changes in XeQOLS scores over time. RESULTS: The mean total duration of coconut oil use during the study period was 16 days (1-71). The average number of uses per day was 3 (1-5), with an average amount per use of 5 mL (1.2-8.5). Twelve patients (41.4%) continued coconut oil use beyond the advised period. There was no statistically significant difference in XeQOLS scores pre- and post-treatment. There were no adverse events during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The use of coconut oil as a treatment strategy for xerostomia post-HNC radiation is feasible, inexpensive, and safe. This study demonstrates that there may be a group of HNC patients that benefit from its use."

There are numerous advocates for the practice of oil pulling to prevent common oral diseases. Therefore determining the effectiveness of oil pulling with coconut oil could potentially have monumental benefits. This review aimed to assess the effect of oil pulling with coconut oil in improving oral health and dental hygiene. DATA: We included randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of oil pulling with coconut oil on improving oral health and dental hygiene.No meta-analysis was performed due to the clinical heterogeneity and differences in the reporting of data among the included studies. SOURCES: Six electronic databases were screened: PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, AMED, CENTRAL and CINAHL. STUDY SELECTION: Electronic searches yielded 42 eligible studies, of which four RCTs including 182 participants were included. The studies lasted between 7 and 14 days. Significant differences were demonstrated for a reduction in salivary bacterial colony count (p = 0.03) and plaque index score (p=<0.001). One study also demonstrated a significant difference in staining compared to using Chlorhexidine (p = 0.0002). However, data was insufficient for conclusive findings, the quality of studies was mixed and risk of bias was high. CONCLUSION: The limited evidence suggests that oil pulling with coconut oil may have a beneficial effect on improving oral health and dental hygiene. Future clinical trials are of merit considering the universal availability of the intervention. Prospective research should have a robust design with rigorous execution to provide a higher quality of evidence. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Oil pulling with coconut oil could be used as a adjunct to normal preventative regimes to improve oral health and dental hygiene although further studies are needed to determine the level of effectiveness."

The study investigated the possible ameliorative effect of virgin coconut oil against l-dopa- induced neurotoxicity in adult rats. A total number of 40 rats were divided into four groups. Briefly, the first served as control, the second was orally administered virgin coconut oil (1.42 mL/kg), the third group was administered a single daily dose of l-dopa/carbidopa (100/10 mg/kg/day, p.o) and the fourth group pre-treated with virgin coconut oil then administered a single daily dose of l-dopa/carbidopa. The different treatments were extended for 30 days. l-dopa treated group exhibited aggressive behavior and behavioral abnormalities in open field test compared to control group. In addition, l-dopa treatment caused significant increase in the levels of striatal dopamine and norepinephrine and their metabolites with concomitant decrease of serotonin and its metabolite. Moreover, l-dopa treatment increased histamine and GABA levels. In addition, l-dopa treatment induced oxidative stress and energy crisis. The histological and immunohistochemical studies showed that l-dopa caused a remarkable neurodegeneration and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoexpression in the striatal area. Virgin coconut oil co-treatment significantly minimized the harmful effects of l-dopa. In conclusion, the present study revealed that virgin coconut oil provided a notable protection against l-dopa's untoward effects.",

The anthropometric profile, lipid profile and glycaemia were evaluated at the baseline and 45 days after intervention. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to compare the groups, and the Wilcoxon test was performed to compare the times. We considered a value of p < 0.05 as significant. There was no difference in anthropometric variables between the groups before and after intervention. The level of HDL cholesterol increased (3.67 ± 8.08 versus-3.79 ± 10.98, p = 0.02) and the TC/HDL cholesterol ratio decreased (-0.63 ± 0.82 versus 0.23 ± 0.80, p = 0.03) in the CO group, compared to the SO group. Coconut oil included in the isoenergetic balanced diet could increase HDL cholesterol and decrease the TC/HDL cholesterol ratio in men with obesity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug linked with considerable organ toxicity caused via increased generation of reactive oxygen species. We evaluated whether the antioxidant effect of virgin coconut oil (VCO) could prevent diclofenac-induced oxidative nephrotoxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized rats were pre-supplemented orally with VCO (5 or 10 ml/kg body weight) from day 1 to 24, and injected with normal saline or diclofenac (100 mg/kg) from day 22 to day 24 intraperitoneally. RESULTS: Diclofenac significantly (p<0.05) increased serum urea and creatinine levels. Renal tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels markedly (p<0.05) increased, whereas renal glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities considerably (p<0.05) decreased compared to normal control. Histopathological alterations were caused by diclofenac. However, treatment with oral VCO for 21 days prior to diclofenac administration, attenuated histological renal damage, and restored antioxidant enzyme activities and TNF-α levels in kidney. CONCLUSION: These findings revealed that VCO has potential benefits to prevent diclofenac-induced nephrotoxic damage."

      "abstract": "In the global incidence of peptic ulcer, with the associated rates of hospitalizations and mortality are increasing, in the United States, peptic ulcer disease affects approximately 4.6 million people annually, with an estimated 10% of the US population having evidence of a duodenal ulcer. The present research aims to find a novel treatment for ethanol induced ulcer by loading thymoquinone (TQ) on a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC), using Compritol® 888 and coconut oil. The TQ-loaded coconut oil NLC was formulated using melt emulsification combined with a sonication method using Poloxamer 188 as a surfactant. Finally, the optimization of the formulations was performed on a three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken statistical design, with 85.63% entrapment efficiency of TQ in the optimized formulation. A biphasic release pattern of the formulation was recorded in an in vitro drug release study, where the initial burst release of the drug was observed in the first 2 h, followed by a gradual release. Later, the TQ-loaded coconut oil NLC was found to protect the gastric mucous membrane more effectively (78.95% in.; p < 0.01) in an alcohol-induced ulcer model, whereas the TQ suspension showed 30.87% inhibition (p < 0.05) of the ulcerative index, when compared with the ulcer control group. The histopathological evaluations of the stomach in ulcer-induced animals demonstrated protection potential of TQ-loaded coconut oil NLC against an alcohol-induced gastric ulcer. In a nutshell, the entrapment of TQ within the NLC was found to deliver the entrapped drug more effectively when administered through an oral route to possess a gastroprotective effect.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Medium-chain-triglycerides (MCT), formed by fatty acids with a length of 6-12 carbon atoms (C6-C12), constitute about two thirds of coconut oil (Coc). MCT have specific metabolic properties which has led them to be described as ketogenic even in the absence of carbohydrate restriction. This effect has mainly been demonstrated for caprylic acid (C8), which constitutes about 6-8% of coconut oil. Our aim was to quantify ketosis and blood glucose after intake of Coc and C8, with and without glucose intake. Sunflower oil (Suf) was used as control, expected to not break fasting ketosis, nor induce supply-driven ketosis. Method: In a 6-arm cross-over design, 15 healthy volunteers-age 65-73, 53% women-were tested once a week. After a 12-h fast, ketones were measured during 4 h after intake of coffee with cream, in combination with each of the intervention arms in a randomized order: 1. Suf (30 g); 2. C8 (20 g) + Suf (10 g); 3. C8 (20 g) + Suf (10 g) + Glucose (50 g); 4. Coc (30 g); 5. Coc (30 g) + Glucose (50 g); 6. C8 (20 g) + Coc (30 g). The primary outcome was absolute blood levels of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate, area under the curve (AUC). ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to compare arms. Results: β-hydroxybutyrate, AUC/time (mean ± SD), for arms were 1: 0.18 ± 0.11; 2: 0.45 ± 0.19; 3: 0.28 ± 0.12; 4: 0.22 ± 0.12; 5: 0.08 ± 0.04; 6: 0.45 ± 0.20 (mmol/L). Differences were significant (all p ≤ 0.02), except for arm 2 vs. 6, and 4 vs. 1 & 3. Blood glucose was stable in arm 1, 2, 4, & 6, at levels slightly below baseline (p ≤ 0.05) at all timepoints hours 1-4 after intake. Conclusions: C8 had a higher ketogenic effect than the other components. Coc was not significantly different from Suf, or C8 with glucose. In addition, we report that a 16-h non-carbohydrate window contributed to a mild ketosis, while blood glucose remained stable. Our results suggest that time-restricted feeding regarding carbohydrates may optimize ketosis from intake of MCT. Clinical Trial Registration: The study was registered as a clinical trial on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03904433."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that supplementation of nursery and grower pig diets with coconut oil in the absence of antibiotics would yield maintenance of glucose homeostasis, growth performance, and immune function similar to what is achieved with nursery and grower pig diets containing antibiotics. Pigs received the same base treatment diets from d24 (weaning) to d71 of age and had blood and fecal samples collected on d24, d31, d45 and d71 for measurement of whole blood glucose, serum insulin, cortisol and cytokines, and fecal microbiome. Pigs had weekly weights and daily feed consumption measured throughout the study. Animals were euthanized at d71 and subcutaneous fat and ileal contents were collected for assessment for fatty acids and microbiome, respectively. Diet treatments consisted of 2% soybean oil plus antibiotics (ABX; n = 22), 2% soybean oil without antibiotics (NABX; n = 22), and 2% coconut oil without antibiotics (COC; n = 22). Statistical analysis examined the effect of diet within each timepoint using a repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Pigs fed COC diet had decreased serum insulin levels, maintained feed intake, feed conversion and weight gain, and, based on serum cytokines and fecal microbiome, were immunologically similar to ABX-fed pigs. However, NABX-fed pigs performed similarly to the ABX-fed pigs in all parameters except for serum cytokines. Additionally, there was no difference in the incidence of diarrhea between any of the diet treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that dietary antibiotics are not necessary to maintain growth performance in nursery and grower pigs. However, dietary antibiotics appear to modulate circulating cytokine levels. Dietary coconut oil is neither harmful nor helpful to growth performance or immune function in nursery and grower pigs but does modulate serum insulin levels. Therefore, while coconut oil fed at 2% by weight is a suitable substitute for dietary antibiotics, this study suggests that no substitute for dietary antibiotics is needed at all."

The antineoplastic activity of MTX-NE COCO, which is MTX formulated in coconut oil nanoemulsion (NE), was evaluated in A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells while its adverse side effects on the oxidative stress of the lung and brain were assessed in mice. The z-average diameter for the dispersed nanodroplet of MTX-NE COCO (79.74 ± 3.49 nm) was considerably greater than the free-NE COCO (64.80 ± 3.34 nm). In contrast, the magnitude of the negative z-potential of MTX-NE COCO (3.00 ± 0.69 mV) was markedly less than that of free-NE COCO (8.20 ± 0.76 mV). The minimum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of MTX-NE COCO (18 ± 1.8 µM) was less than the IC50 of free MTX (32 ± 1.2 µM) by around twofold. The in vivo evaluation of the MTX-NE COCO treatment revealed that the antioxidant enzymes activities of the brain and lung tissues, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase, were relatively raised while the malondialdehyde amount was diminished when compared to the free MTX treatment. In conclusion, combining MTX with coconut oil in a NE had improved its efficacy while ameliorating its oxidative stress effect on the brain and lungs.",

METHODS: Coconut oil used in this study was virgin coconut oil (VCO) and VCO hydrolysed by Rhizomucor miehei (HVCO). NIH 3T3 cells (5x105 cells/well) were seeded in nine wells and incubated for overnight, then divided into three groups. Each group consisted of three wells. Group one without treatment, group two added VCO, and group three added HVCO and then incubated for overnight. One well in each group was added MMP-9, PDGF-BB, and TGF-β1 and incubated one hour. Finally, expressions of MMP-9, PDGF-BB, and TGF-β1 were detected using immunocytochemistry method. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that VCO and HVCO increased protein expressions of MMP-9, PDGF-BB, and TGF-β1. Percentage of MMP-9 expressions treated by VCO increased from 2.89 ± 0.07 to 28.16 ± 0.34, PDGF-BB from 28.11 ± 0.13 to 48.53 ± 0.49, and TGF-β1 from 4.19 ± 0.08 to 18.41 ± 0.54.

The study aimed to determine the protective effects of combined therapy of VCO and TRF on osteoporosis in ovariectomized (OVX) rat fed with high-fat diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Sham-operated (SHAM), OVX control, OVX and given Premarin at 64.5 µg/kg (OVX+E2), OVX and given VCO at 4.29 ml/kg (OVX+V), OVX and given TRF at 30 mg/kg (OVX+T), and OVX and given a combination of VCO at 4.29 ml/kg and TRF at 30 mg/kg (OVX+VT). Following 24 weeks of treatments, blood and femora samples were taken for analyses. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in serum osteocalcin levels between the groups (p>0.05), while serum C-terminal telopeptide of Type I collagen levels of the OVX+VT group were significantly lower than the other groups (p<0.05). The dynamic bone histomorphometry analysis of the femur showed that the double-labeled surface/bone surface (dLS/BS), mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate/BS of the OVX+E2, OVX+T, and OVX+VT groups were significantly higher than the rest of the groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: A combination of VCO and TRF has the potential as a therapeutic agent to restore bone loss induced by ovariectomy and high-fat diet."
