      "abstract": "Earlier laboratory-based evidence has suggested that polyphenol-rich, decaffeinated whole coffee cherry extract (CCE) supports improvements in acute and long-term cognitive performance. To better understand CCE's potential to promote cognitive processing, we conducted a first-of-its-kind remote clinical trial. Participants were randomized into one of two intervention arms: placebo or 200 mg CCE. At the beginning of the study, participants were asked to complete a set of acute cognitive challenges as part of the baseline assessment. Tasks were nearly identical to those used in previous, laboratory-based research. Acute results support that CCE outperformed placebo, reducing omissions and improving accuracy, during working memory and inhibitory control tasks. Long-term results indicate that CCE outperformed placebo on a measure of accuracy. This contributes to the literature in three ways: (1) results improve upon previously reported robust and consistent findings in a real-world setting that a single-dose of CCE acutely improved cognitive performance; (2) results replicate previous laboratory findings but in a real-world setting that long-term CCE supplementation outperformed placebo on measures of accuracy in a working memory task; and (3) it serves as proof of concept of a novel remote clinical trial model that may provide real-world evidence of efficacy while increasing accessibility and cohort diversity.",

      "abstract": "Several types of gluten-related disorders are known, in which the common starting point is gluten-induced zonulin release. Zonulin results in varying degrees of increased permeability in certain gluten-related disorders but is largely responsible for the development of further pathogenic processes and symptoms. Therefore, it is important to know the barrier-modulating role of individual nutritional components and to what extent the antioxidant substance supports the protection of gliadin-induced membrane damage with its radical scavenging capacity. We investigated the pH dependence of the gliadin-anthocyanin interaction using UV photometry, during which a concentration-dependent interaction was observed at pH 6.8. The barrier modulatory effect of the anthocyanin-rich sour cherry extract (AC) was analyzed on Caco-2 cell culture with pepsin-trypsin-resistant gliadin (PT-gliadin) exposure by TEER measurement, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and Occludin immunohistochemistry. In addition to the TEER-reducing and TJ-rearranging effects of PT-gliadin, NF-κB activation, an increase in cytokine (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-8) release, and mitochondrial ROS levels were observed. We confirmed the anti-inflammatory, stabilizing, and restoring roles of AC extract during gliadin treatment on the Caco-2 monolayer. The extract was able to significantly reduce cytokine and ROS levels despite the known interaction of the main components of the extract with PT-gliadin."

In both cell types, cell-cell connections play a regulatory role in altering membrane permeability. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulating effect of anthocyanin-rich extract (AC) on TJ proteins in inflammatory Caco-2 and HUVEC monolayers. Distribution of Occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were investigated by immunohistochemical staining and the protein levels were measured by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values were measured during a permeability assay on HUVEC cell culture. As a result of inflammatory induction by TNF-α, redistribution of proteins was observed in Caco-2 cell culture, which was reduced by AC treatment. In HUVEC cell culture, the decrease in protein and mRNA expression was more dominant during inflammatory induction, which was compensated for by the AC treatment. Overall, AC positively affected the expression of the examined cell-binding structures forming the membrane on both cell types.",

      "abstract": "Combined treatments using polyphenols and omega fatty acids provide several therapeutic benefits for a variety of age-related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we found a commercial product, Total Body Rhythm (TBR), consisting of tart cherry extract, a potent polyphenol, and omega fatty acids, significantly reduced memory, and neuropathological deficits in the 192 IgG-saporin mouse model of AD. The present study assessed the efficacy of TBR for treating behavioral and neuropathological deficits in the 5xFAD model of AD. Both 6- and 12-month-old 5xFAD mice and age-matched wild-type controls received TBR (60 mg/kg) or the equivalent dose of vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) via oral administration, every other day for two months. All mice were tested in the open field (OF), novel object recognition (NOR), and the Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. In addition, neuronal morphology, neurodegeneration, Aβ plaque load, and glial activation were assessed. TBR treatment reduced memory deficits in the MWM and NOR tests and lessened anxiety levels in the OF task, mostly in the 6-month-old male mice. TBR also protected against neuron loss, reduced activation of astrocytes and microglia, primarily in 6-month-old mice, and attenuated Aβ deposition. These results suggest that the combination of tart cherry extract and omega fatty acids in TBR can reduce AD-like deficits in 5xFAD mice."

Here, we investigate the functional effect of tart cherry during apoptotic cell death elicited by airborne particulate matter with a diameter of <10 μm (PM10) in human epidermal keratinocyte HaCaT cells. The PM10 particles significantly induced cytotoxicity in the HaCaT cells. The decrease in cell viability was restored upon treatment with tart cherry extract (200 μg/mL) containing chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and kaempferol. Tart cherry inhibited the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for the distinctive activations of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in PM10-treated HaCaT cells. Interestingly, tart cherry significantly inhibited the expression of apoptosis-related genes (B-Cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and caspase-3) as regulated by the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). These results demonstrate that tart cherry is a medicinal food that blocks the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis induced by PM10 in human epidermal keratinocytes."

Several sweet cherry cultivars from Fundão (Portugal) were methanol-extracted and their phytochemical composition characterized. The Saco \"late harvest\" extract was highly-enriched in anthocyanins and selected for use in biological assays. Non-neoplastic (PNT1A) and neoplastic (LNCaP and PC3) human prostate cells were treated with 0-2,000 μg/ml of extract for 48-96 h. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay. Apoptosis, oxidative stress, and glycolytic metabolism were assessed by Western blotting and enzymatic assays. Glucose consumption and lactate production were measured spectrophotometrically. Saco cherry extract diminished the viability of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells, whereas enhancing apoptosis in LNCaP. Cherry extract-treatment also diminished oxidative damage and suppressed glycolytic metabolism in LNCaP cells. These findings widened the knowledge on the mechanisms by which cherry extract modulate cell physiology, demonstrating their broad action over the hallmarks of cancer.",

The control group received standard mouse chow, and the high fat control group was switched to a high fat diet and tap water supplemented with 5% sucrose. The high fat + anthocyanin group received the high fat and sucrose diet, but received the anthocyanin-rich tart cherry extract dissolved in their drinking water. After six weeks, an oral glucose tolerance test was performed, and the water-soluble antioxidant capacity (ACW), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and the plasma levels of insulin, C-peptide, leptin, IL-6, MCP-1, adiponectin and resistin were measured. The high fat diet increased body weight, reduced glucose tolerance, and caused an elevation in leptin, IL-6, MCP-1, and resistin levels. Furthermore, antioxidant capacity was decreased with a significant elevation of SOD activity. Anthocyanin treatment failed to reverse the effects of the high fat diet on body weight and glucose tolerance, but significantly reduced the leptin and IL-6 levels. The tart cherry extract also made a significant enhancement in antioxidant capacity and SOD activity. Our results show that chronic anthocyanin intake has a potential to enhance redox status and alleviate inflammation associated with obesity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report patient-centered outcomes and finalization of key study procedures from a 9-month pilot internet randomized controlled trial of cherry extract versus diet modification. METHODS: We randomized 84 people with physician-confirmed gout in an internet study to cherry extract (n = 41) or dietitian-assisted diet modification for gout (n = 43). All study outcomes were collected via internet and phone calls. We finalized key study procedures. We assessed acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and satisfaction with study website. RESULTS: Study participant satisfaction with the intervention was high. The intervention was perceived as easy, enjoyable, understandable, and helpful (scores 65-88 for all; higher = better). The amount of time spent for the study was acceptable. Participant satisfaction with website interaction and content was very high; 85% or more were moderately to extremely satisfied. Significantly lower total calories, total carbohydrate, and saturated fat intake were noted at 6 months in the diet modification versus cherry extract group; differences were insignificant at 9 months. Six of the 8 Health Assessment Questionnaire sections/domains improved significantly from baseline to 9 months in cherry extract versus 2 Health Assessment Questionnaire sections/domains in the diet modification group. Key study procedures were finalized for a future trial, including an internet diet assessment tool, gout flare assessment, provider confirmation of gout diagnosis, patient reporting of classification criteria, and centralized laboratory-assisted serum urate testing. CONCLUSIONS: High patient acceptability and feasibility of study/intervention and finalization of key study procedures indicate that hypothesis-testing internet gout trials of cherry extract and/or diet modification can be conducted in the future.",

Recent studies indicate that dietary supplements of antioxidants and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may reduce the cognitive deficits in AD patients. The current study tested a combinatorial treatment of antioxidants from tart cherry extract and essential fatty acids from Nordic fish and emu oils for reducing cognitive deficits in the mu-p75 saporin (SAP)-induced mouse model of AD. Mice were given daily gavage treatments of Cerise(®) Total-Body-Rhythm™ (TBR; containing tart cherry extract, Nordic fish oil, and refined emu oil) or vehicle (methylcellulose) for 2 weeks before intracerebroventricular injections of the cholinergic toxin, mu-p75 SAP, or phosphate-buffered saline. The TBR treatments continued for an additional 17 days, when the mice were tested on a battery of cognitive and motor tasks. Results indicate that TBR decreased the SAP-induced cognitive deficits assessed by the object-recognition, place-recognition, and Morris-water-maze tasks. Histological examination of the brain tissue indicated that TBR protected against SAP-induced inflammatory response and loss of cholinergic neurons in the area around the medial septum. These findings indicate that TBR has the potential to serve as an adjunctive treatment which may help reduce the severity of cognitive deficits in disorders involving cholinergic deficits, such as AD.",

To test this hypothesis, various dosages of anthocyanin-rich tart cherry extract were fed in combination with suboptimal levels of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac to APCMin mice for 19 weeks. By the end of the feeding period, fewer mice that were fed the anthocyanin-rich extract in combination with sulindac lost more than 10% of body weight than mice fed sulindac alone. Mice that were fed anthocyanin-rich extract (at any dose) in combination with sulindac had fewer tumors and a smaller total tumor burden (total tumor area per mouse) in the small intestine when compared to mice fed sulindac alone. These results suggest that a dietary combination of tart cherry anthocyanins and sulindac is more protective against colon cancer than sulindac alone.",

Pretreatment with ACE (dose, 70mg/kg body weight and 700 mg/kg body weight) inhibited increases in the levels of proliferating nuclear cell antigen and ornithine decarboxylase at the promotion stage. This treatment of ACE also suppressed the activation of Ras signal pathway at the same stage.
