      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piroxicam, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, is commonly used to induce inflammation in experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Piroxicam can modulate the immune system and disrupt the mucosal barrier, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of single-clove garlic (Allium sativum var. solo garlic) extract (SGE) on liver histopathological findings, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in white rats (Rattus norvegicus) Wistar strain induced with piroxicam. METHODS: The study used a completely randomized design with 30 male Wistar rats aged 2 months and weighing 150-200 g. The rats were divided into five groups: negative control (C), receiving CMC-Na 0,5% only; positive control (T0), receiving 20 mg/kgBW piroxicam; and three treatment groups, receiving 20 mg/kgBW piroxicam combined with 75 mg/kgBW (T1), 100 mg/kgBW (T2), or 125 mg/kgBW (T3) of SGE. Piroxicam was administered orally to induce inflammation, followed by SGE treatment for 14 days. Liver histopathological images were measured for damage repair using the scoring method. Superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. RESULTS: The results showed a significant increase in SOD levels (p < 0.05) in the treatment groups compared with the T0 (20 mg/kgBW piroxicam), with the T3 (125 mg/kgBW piroxicam) showing the most significant effect. Additionally, MDA levels were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in all treatment groups, indicating a reduction in oxidative damage. Statistical analysis revealed a dose-dependent relationship between garlic extract administration and improvement in liver histopathological findings and oxidative stress markers. CONCLUSION: SGE is a potent antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress in a piroxicam-induced IBD model and contributes to good health. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects and to optimize the therapeutic potential of IBD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several alternative feed additives to replace AGP to maintain good quail performance include the use of probiotics and herbal extracts. AIM: In this study, the researchers want to find out the best dosage of microbiota inoculum as probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus plantarum), single garlic extract (Allium Sativum L), and combination groups to improve laying quail egg production, hematology profile (erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes, and platelets), and reproductive organs in terms of length and weight and have better egg quality on the internal (Haugh units, yolk score, albumin index, yolk index) and external (shell thickness, egg weight) while laying phase of laying quail. METHODS: A total of 100 4-week-old laying quails of uniform body weight were randomly distributed into five treatments with four replicates each and five quails in each replicate. There were 5 treatment groups: T0 quails were given basal feed; T1 quails were given basal feed and drinking water added with probiotics at a dose of 4 ml/l; T2 quails were given feed added with a single garlic extract at a dose of 2 ml/g and ordinary drinking water; T3 quails were given feed with a single garlic extract at a dose of 2 ml/g and drinking water supplemented with probiotics at a dose of 4 ml/l; and T4 quails were given a single garlic extract at a dose of 1 ml/g and drinking water supplemented with probiotics at a dose of 2 ml/l. The study investigated the effects of microbiota inoculum, including probiotics, garlic extract, and a control group, on reproductive organ morphologies in chickens. Results showed significant improvements in weight vagina, uterus, oviduct, ovarium, weight cloaca, growth performance, body weight, egg production, internal egg quality, yolk color score, yolk index, albumin index, external egg quality, Haugh unit, egg height, shape index, egg cell weight, and egg cell thickness. RESULTS: The number of erythrocytes was significantly higher in the chickens treated with the microbiota inoculum compared to the control group. Hemoglobin levels were not significant in all treatments, but hematocrit levels were significant in the chickens treated with the microbiota inoculum. Leukocytes were also significantly higher in the chickens treated with the microbiota inoculum compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The use of a combination of microbiota inoculum in drinking water and garlic extract in feed has been proven to be effective in reducing feed consumption, maintaining hematology, increasing reproductive organs, and boosting the number of laying quail productions, thereby reducing feed conversion ratio.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by plaque buildup within the arteries that obstructs blood flow and significantly increases the morbidity and mortality rates associated with cardiovascular diseases caused by impaired blood flow due to vascular stenosis or occlusion, such as angina and myocardial infarction. The development of atherosclerosis involves a complex interplay of endothelial dysfunction, accumulation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein and macrophage-driven inflammation. The risk factors for atherosclerosis include chronic inflammation, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Effective management of these risk factors can prevent and delay the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. Garlic and its processed preparations have previously been utilized to mitigate cardiovascular risk factors and continue to be used in traditional medicine in several countries. Among these preparations, aged garlic extract (AGE) has been shown to improve atherosclerosis in clinical trials and animal studies. AGE contains various compounds with potential anti-atherosclerotic properties, such as S-1-propenylcysteine, S-allylcysteine and other sulfur-containing constituents, which may help prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The present manuscript reviewed and discussed the anti-atherogenic effect of AGE and its constituents by highlighting their mode of action and potential benefits for prevention and therapy in the management of atherosclerosis."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: In the genus Allium, it has been shown that some organosulfate compounds of common garlic and onion have an antiplatelet effect. Still, little is known about the anticoagulant activity of the species, Allium ampeloprasum L., specifically Snow mountain garlic; due to its growth site at 6000 m above sea level at temperatures of -10 °C, it could contain different organosulfate compounds. Methods: This study evaluated the anticoagulant effect of a lyophilized aqueous extract of S. mountain garlic in vivo, toxicity in male Wistar rats for 90 days, and the organosulfate compounds present. Results: There was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the area under the curve for bleeding time at doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg/d of lyophilized aqueous extract of Snow mountain garlic and 100 mg/kg/d of acetylsalicylic acid. The ED50 was 366 ± 2.43 mg/kg. For chronic toxicity in vivo, no histopathological alterations were found at doses below 500 mg/kg. On the other hand, organosulfate compounds were found in the lyophilized aqueous extract of S. mountain garlic that had not been documented to have an anticoagulant effect. Conclusions: We conclude that S. mountain garlic contains anticoagulant compounds which may be candidates for the treatment of thrombosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem worldwide. Numerous traditional plants are used for preventing DM. However, limited evidence supports the association between garlic consumption and DM. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Data used in this study was from the 2008-2018 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Data on garlic consumption was obtained by questionnaire, and DM by self-reported diagnosis. A multivariate adjusted Cox regression model was used to estimate haz-ard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to determine the incidence of DM. RESULTS: A total of 1927 participants were included in this study, of which 24.08% consumed garlic daily and 20.08% developed DM. The HR for daily garlic consumption decreased by 42%, when compared to rare or no garlic con-sumption. Our subgroup analyses revealed that daily garlic consumption significantly reduced the risk of DM in older adults aged 65-79, rural, non-drinkers informal education, financial dependence, and working in agriculture (aged 65-79: HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.80; rural area: HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.77; non-drinkers: HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41-0.86; informal education: HR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.29-0.74; financial dependence: HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.23-0.65; agricultural work: HR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.32-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Garlic consumption can reduce the risk of DM in older Chinese adults. This benefit varies by age, current residence, drinking status, education level, occupation, and economic source. Future efforts should focus on developing dietary intervention strategies that consider demographic, educational, financial, and occupational disparities to effectively prevent diabetes in older populations.",

      "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a local enlargement of the abdominal aorta with the risk of its fatal rupture. With lack of established medical treatments reducing the AAA growth, the development of treatment strategies for AAA is warranted. In this study, we examined whether aged garlic extract (AGE), which reportedly has vasoprotective effects, attenuates AAA formation in an animal model. AAAs were induced via CaCl2 application to the abdominal aortas of C57BL/6J mice. The intake of an AGE-containing diet attenuated the aortic dilatation after AAA induction. Histological analysis showed that the degradation of elastic fibers in AAAs was mild in mice fed AGE compared to that in control mice. In addition, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), a proteolytic enzyme degrading aortic tissue, was decreased in AAAs from mice fed with AGE. In cultured macrophages, AGE significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced Mmp9 mRNA expression. Furthermore, AGE attenuated TNF-α-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and c-fos mRNA expression, suggesting the suppressive effect of AGE on ERK-c-Fos-MMP9 axis induced by TNF-α. The present findings indicate that AGE diminishes AAA formation by mitigating tissue destruction, highlighting the potential cardiovascular benefits of AGE intake."

Garlic fructans have shown great potential for improving gastrointestinal health. This study aimed to elucidate the protective effects and mechanisms of three garlic fructans with different degrees of polymerization (DPs) against loperamide (Lop)-induced constipated mice. The results showed that garlic fructans accelerated intestinal motility (0.57-1.05-fold) and alleviated colonic crypt shortening (1.42-1.97-fold). Furthermore, dysregulation of excitatory/inhibitory gastrointestinal hormones was significantly alleviated, accompanied by restored propionic and butyric acid production and ameliorated bile acid metabolism disorders. Garlic fructans also improved gut microbiota homeostasis in constipated mice by inhibiting harmful bacteria and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria. Compared with high-DP garlic fructans, low-DP fructans exhibited stronger relieving effects on Lop-induced constipation symptoms in mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the anticonstipation activity of garlic fructans and revealed that low-DP garlic fructans were more effective in alleviating Lop-induced constipation.",

      "abstract": "The lone application of ammonium fertilizer is one of the most commonly used measures to supplement soil nutrients. At the same time, it also causes soil acidification and leads to many environmental problems, such as soil degradation and eutrophication. Garlic (Allium sativum L.) stalk (RGS) returning has been widely researched for its benefits related to soil organic carbon (SOC) and crop yields. However, few have researched the effects of the incorporation of RGS mixed with ammonium fertilizer on soil physicochemical properties and the bacterial community composition. We incubated soil with the control (N0); ammonium sulfate (AS); and ammonium sulfate combined with 1%, 2%, 3%, and 5% (rate of the dry soil weight) garlic stalk at 25 °C and 60% water-filled pore spaces (WFPS) for 67 days. We measured the soil properties before and on the last day of the experiment. The results showed that adding RGS increased the contents of soil potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and total nitrogen (TN), but it significantly decreased soil nitrate (NO3-). In addition, adding RGS increased the relative abundance of r-strategists and the soil r/K ratio. The α diversity of soil bacteria reached the highest value with 3% treatment. Compared to AS, RGS increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria but decreased that of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The function genes of Replication_and_Repair and Cell_Motility were enhanced after adding AS, while the function genes of Metabolism_of_Other_Amino_Acids, Enzyme_Families, and Metabolism were enhanced with increased RGS rates. Although SOC increased, NO3- significantly decreased with the increase in the returning levels, which could be due to the strong decreases in nitrifying bacteria with increases in RGS rates from 3% to 5%. Therefore, adding RGS at 3% is suitable for soil bacterial biodiversity and nutrient balance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity has recently become the most prevalent diet-related disease worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the effects of aerobic exercise, stevia, and garlic extract on leptin and ghrelin receptor mRNA, as well as the interactions between insulin and glucose in relation to these genes. METHODS: A total of 50 male Wistar rats were split into two groups: one group was fed regular rodent food, while the other was fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce obesity. The obese rats were then divided into six groups of five (N = 5) based on Lee's index: an obese control group (OC), obese treated with garlic, stevia (OGS), obese aerobic exercise (OE), obese garlic and aerobic exercise (OGE), Obese stevia and aerobic exercise (OSE), and a Normal weight group (NC). The exercise groups participated in a gradually increasing aerobic walking program, whereas the stevia and garlic groups received daily oral doses of their respective extracts. The expression of leptin and ghrelin receptor genes in the hypothalamus was measured using real-time PCR, and insulin resistance was calculated using the HOMA/IR formula. Statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA, with a significance level set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The obese (O) rats experienced a significant increase in body weight compared with the control (C) rats (p = 0.013), whereas the treated rats showed no significant changes in weight. Leptin receptor mRNA levels were significantly lower in O rats than in C rats (p = 0.00), but increased significantly in the OS (p = 0.000) and OSE (p = 0.034) groups compared with obese rats. Ghrelin receptor mRNA levels were significantly higher in the O group than in the C group (p = 0.035), but decreased in all treatment groups, with the OE (p = 0.001), OGE (p = 0.001), and OSE (p = 0.004) groups showing the greatest reductions. Insulin resistance increased slightly in the O group compared with the C group (p = 0.112), but was lowest in the OS group among all groups (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Stevia significantly improved leptin and ghrelin receptor mRNA expression, glucose levels, and insulin resistance in obese rats, showing its potential as an effective dietary intervention for managing obesity.",

      "abstract": "The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a very significant health issue in the period between 2020 and 2023, forcing research to characterize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 are considered significant therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and emerging evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) serve a key role in regulating these genes. MiRNAs are short, 19-25 nucleotides in length, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through the sequence-selective recognition of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the regulated mRNAs, eventually repressing translation, commonly, via mRNA degradation. For example, among several miRNAs involved in the regulation of the COVID-19 'cytokine storm', miR-93-5p can inhibit IL-8 gene expression by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of IL-8 mRNA. In addition, miR-93-5p can regulate Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) expression, thus affecting the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and the expression of NF-κB-regulated genes, such as IL-6, IL-1β and other hyper-expressed genes during the COVID-19 'cytokine storm'. In the present study, the results provided preliminary evidence suggesting that the miR-93-5p-based miRNA therapeutics could be combined with the anti-inflammatory aged garlic extract (AGE) to more effectively inhibit IL-8 gene expression. The human bronchial epithelial IB3-1 cell line was employed as experimental model system. IB3-1 cells were stimulated with the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine and transfected with pre-miR-93-5p in the absence or in the presence of AGE, to verify the inhibitory effects on the BNT162b2-induced expression of the IL-8 gene. The accumulation of IL-8 mRNA was assessed by RT-qPCR; the release of IL-8 protein was determined by Bio-Plex assay. In addition, the possible applications of TLR4/NF-κB inhibitory agents (such as miR-93-5p and AGE) for treating human pathologies at a hyperinflammatory state, such as COVID-19, cystic fibrosis and other respiratory diseases, were summarized."

      "abstract": "The present 18-month study assessed the long-term effects of aged garlic extract (AGE) on deep periodontal pockets in generally healthy adults with moderate-to-severe periodontal pockets. The present study was a randomized, controlled, examiner-blind trial, involving four parallel treatment groups, including three AGE dosage groups and a placebo (control) group, with 300 participants in total. Study participants were instructed to use the AGE products at home throughout the study, following both written and verbal guidelines provided at the start. Periodontal assessments, including periodontal measurements, were performed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months. After 18 months, a significant reduction in pocket depth was observed in the AGE groups compared with that of the placebo group, indicating a dose-response trend. In a multiple linear regression analysis, the baseline pocket depth, smoking status and the amount of AGE consumed on a daily basis were all demonstrated to be predictors of pocket depth. The results of the present study indicate that AGE is effective in improving oral health and further emphasize the potential role of AGE in promoting overall health due to the link between periodontitis and systemic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis."

METHODOLOGY: Two hundred and forty patients indicated for root canal therapy were divided into two main groups as single-rooted teeth and multirooted teeth. Each group was further subdivided into four subgroups of 30 samples each. After the access opening, instrumentation was done as per the canal configuration. The herbal medicaments were prepared as an aqueous extract. The placement of ICM in the subgroups was randomly determined by computerized randomization. Interappointment flare-up and pain were assessed using VRS on 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The intergroup comparisons of the incidence of flare-up were done using analysis of variance, followed by post hoc Tukey's test to test for the difference among individual groups. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the four groups, with P = 0.02 for multirooted teeth and 0.03 for single-rooted teeth. The post hoc Tukey's test showed the intergroup comparison of the flare-up incidence between garlic and Triphala to be statistically significant favoring Triphala, with P = 0.004 in single-rooted teeth and 0.008 in multirooted teeth. CONCLUSION: Although there was no statistical significance between them, Triphala can be considered an alternative to CH as ICM. However, neem and garlic showed poor results."

      "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of a botanical-derived feed additive containing capsicum oleoresin, clove and garlic essential oils (CCG; Fytera Start, Selko, Indianapolis, IN) in nursery pigs fed with or without pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. In Exp. 1756 pigs (Duroc × Landrace/Large White composite (Smithfield Premium Genetics), initially 7.8 ± 0.09 kg) were used in a 40-d study to determine the effects of CCG level on growth performance of nursery pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. In Exp. 2340 barrows (DNA 200 × 400, initially 6.1 ± 0.08 kg) were used in 38-d study to determine the effect of CCG in diets with or without pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu on growth performance and fecal dry matter (DM). For both experiments, pigs were randomly allotted to pens which were allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design. There were 9 pigs per pen and 21 pens per treatment in Exp. 1 and 5 pigs per pen and 17 pens per treatment in Exp. 2. Dietary treatments in Exp. 1 were corn-soybean meal based with pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu and included either 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of CCG. Dietary treatments in Exp. 2 were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with main effects of CCG (none or 100 mg/kg) and nutritional or pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. All Exp. 2 diets contained 110 mg/kg of Zn and 16.5 mg/kg of Cu from the trace mineral premix. For both experiments, pharmacological levels of Zn were added at 3,000 and 2,000 mg/kg in phase 1 and 2, respectively and Cu was added at 250 mg/kg in all phases. For Exp. 1, overall average daily gain (ADG) increased (linear, P < 0.05) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) tended to increase (linear, P < 0.10) as CCG increased from 0 to 100 mg/kg. For Exp. 2, there was a CCG × Zn/Cu interaction observed for overall ADG and ADFI (P < 0.05) where CCG numerically increased ADG and ADFI in pigs fed nutritional levels of Zn and Cu; but reduced ADG and ADFI in pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. There was a Zn/Cu × day interaction (P = 0.001) for fecal DM, in which there was no difference (P > 0.10) in fecal DM on d 10, but pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu had lower (P < 0.001) fecal DM on d 21 compared to pigs fed nutritional levels of Zn and Cu. In summary, when included in diets with pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu, feeding increasing levels of CCG increased ADG in Exp. 1 but did not improve performance in Exp 2."

      "abstract": "Garlic is a valuable product that has an excessive application due to its impressive nutritional value. The issue of garlic storage as a seasonal product is critical. Therefore, the effective conditions in the storage should be identified and monitored. In this research, three important treatments in garlic storage including packaging materials, packaging atmosphere, and fungal infection were studied. The effect of these treatments on some important qualitative indices in garlic such as weight reduction, browning index, acidity, total soluble solids, toughness, etc was investigated. Also, the non-destructive technology of the electronic nose (E-Nose) was used as a complementary solution in garlic quality monitoring. The data were evaluated by the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Partial Least-Squares Regression (PLSR) methods. The results disclosed well that applying the studied treatments can affect the changes in qualitative traits. Also, changes in qualitative traits were associated with aromatic changes. The E-Nose responses toward the aroma of different treatment combinations (TCs) had a unique pattern but did not represent an exclusive trend. The PLSR results proved among the qualitative properties, the physical and mechanical traits had the highest (97 %) and lowest (24 %) correlation with aroma changes, respectively. Therefore, the E-Nose can be employed as a complementary and non-destructive solution in the quality monitoring of the storage of products such as garlic."

      "abstract": "Garlic is an important spice crop used for flavoring food and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. However, black mold is a common fungal disease affecting garlic, which was caused by an Aspergillus infection. This disease significantly impacts both the production and quality of garlic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity of novel green-synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) against black mold diseases in garlic. An environmentally friendly green synthesis technique was used to produce ZnO-NPs using zinc-tolerant bacteria Serratia sp. (ZTB24). In the present study the experimental analysis viz. UV-Vis spectroscopy at 380 nm, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential confirmed the successful biosynthesis of green ZnO-NPs from Serratia sp. The poisoned food technique and spore germination test revealed the antifungal activities of ZnO-NPs against A. niger under in vitro conditions. The presence of disease-causing A. niger fungus was confirmed through its isolation from infected garlic bulbs, and it was further identified at the molecular level using inter-transcribed sequence (ITS) rDNA sequencing. ZnO-NPs reduced the mycelial growth up to 90% and the 73% spore germination at 250 μg ml-1 concentration of ZnO-NPs. The ZnO-NPs were further used in vivo at different concentrations (50, 100, 250, and 500 ppm) in the post-harvest treatment of garlic. The percentage of disease severity was assessed after 7 and 14 days, and the application of 500 ppm of ZnO-NPs exhibited 0% disease severity in the pre-inoculation method, while disease severity of black mold disease in garlic plant was recorded at 1.10% after 7 days and 0.90% after 14 days in the post-inoculation method, compared to the control group. Hence, the antifungal activity of ZnO-NPs synthesized using the green technique paves the way for the development of natural fungicides, offering a sustainable and renewable alternative to traditional chemical control methods."

The present study aimed to determine the optimized condition for maximum extraction of polyphenols from garlic sprouts through RSM (response surface methodology). However, the proximate, color and microbial analysis were performed on the freeze-dried garlic sprouts. The influences of extraction time (3-9 min), amplitude (50-90 %), ethanol concentration (25-75 %) and solid-liquid ratio (20-40 g/mL) on the extraction yield and total phenolic content (TPC) were investigated. The highest yield was observed on time (9 min), amplitude (70 %), ethanol (25 %) and solid-liquid ratio (30 g/mL) whereas the maximum TPC were measured on time (3 min), amplitude (70 %), ethanol (75 %) and solid-liquid ratio (30 g/mL). The optimal extraction conditions were 5.20 min, 61.1 % ethanol, 71.4 % amplitude and 30.6 g/mL solid-liquid ratio. However, the estimated results of the study are in accordance with the experimental outputs. In addition, chromatographic measurement showed the characterization of polyphenols in garlic sprout extract.

      "abstract": "Skin tissue is susceptible to oxidative stress-induced senescence provoked by ultraviolet (UV) exposure in our daily lives, resulting in photoaging. Herein, we explore whether N-benzyl-N-methyldecan-1-amine (BMDA) derived from garlic ameliorates UVB-induced photoaging. To address this issue, HaCaT keratinocytes were exposed to UVB irradiation under BMDA treatment. The presence of BMDA substantially reduced UVB-induced ROS levels in a dose-dependent manner. BMDA administration counteracted UVB-induced senescence in the β-galactosidase assay. Treatment with BMDA also rescued UVB-exposed cells (S phase; from 18.3 to 25.8%) from cell cycle arrest, similar to the level observed in untreated normal cells. These findings might support our observation that elevated levels of γ-H2AX, a DNA damage marker, under UVB exposure were reduced following BMDA administration. Additionally, BMDA treatment indirectly reduced UVB-induced melanin synthesis in melanocytes since BMDA failed to inhibit tyrosinase activity, a crucial enzyme in melanin synthesis. The topical application of BMDA on the skin of SKH-1 hairless mice also diminished wrinkle formation, supported by recovered collagen levels and the thickness of the epidermis and dermis, compared to those of UVB-control mice. Finally, the BMDA treatment diminished the expression of inflammatory cytokine transcripts such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-6 in the UVB-exposed skin tissues. This finding is further supported by Immunofluorescence microscopy, which showed a decrease in the expression of TNF-α, and IL-1β during BMDA treatment. Altogether, as BMDA mitigates UVB-induced photoaging by reducing ROS production, protecting against DNA damage, and suppressing inflammatory cytokine production, it has been proposed as an effective anti-photoaging molecule.",

A case report highlighted the potential benefits of GE in PCa management. A patient diagnosed with PCa, presenting an initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 11.8 ng/mL, maintained PSA levels between 3.5 and 6 ng/mL for over 14 years with daily GE intake. To study GE's anti-proliferative effects and interactions with established therapeutics, healthy prostate epithelial cells (PNT2) and PCa cells (LNCaP, PC3, VCaP) were treated with GE. Proliferation, Integrin β1 pattern, DNA-damage, as well as androgen receptor (AR) and Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) expression were investigated. GE reduced the proliferation of LNCaP and PC3 cells compared to healthy PNT2 cells but had contrary effects on VCaP cells. The combination of GE with standard therapies, including chemotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and Poly-(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), reduced the efficacy of these treatments in tumor cells, potentially due to the GE-induced upregulation of the metabolic enzyme CYP2C9 in PCa cell lines. These findings indicate that while GE has anti-proliferative effects, the use of highly concentrated natural extracts must be carefully assessed by expert physicians on a case-by-case basis, especially when combined with established therapies.",

We demonstrated that yeast-fermented garlic (YF) extract significantly increased autophag flux in OUMS-36T-1 and HeLa cells expressing the fluorescent probe (GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3ΔG). YF-induced increase of autophagy occurred independently of mTORC1 signaling, and RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that EGR1 was the most significantly altered gene in YF-treated OUMS-36T-1 cells. YF-treated EGR1-deficient HAP1 cells displayed reduced autophagic flux (p < 0.05). YF-induced increasing of autophagic flux occurred via a specific SPM/SPD ratio. HAP1 cells treated with equivalent amounts of SPD or SPM as that found in YF did not increase autophagic flux (p > 0.05); however, treatment with SPD and SPM in the same ratio as that found in YF increased autophagic flux (p < 0.05). This specific SPM/SPD ratio reduced MG132-induced proteostress via EGR1-dependent pathways (p < 0.05). Thus, the SPM/SPD balance may regulate autophagy via EGR1-dependent pathways, and controlling this balance may provide a strategy to maintain cellular homeostasis.",

It contains numerous bioactive organosulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin, with reported potential for anticancer and antimicrobial therapy. The biological activity and potential use of garlic and its products have been extensively investigated. Aged garlic extract (AGE) is a product manufactured by aging garlic, and has been shown to have numerous health benefits. It has been previously revealed that several garlic-derived compounds, including AGE, have tumor-suppressive effects in various cancer models. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers, and carries a dismal prognosis. Recently, numerous tumors, including PDAC, were shown to harbor intracellular bacteria, some of which are oral pathogens. Tumor-associated bacteria have been linked to cancer progression. Garlic may inhibit tumor development, in part, by targeting these bacteria. Although it requires further investigation, pharmacological and antibacterial effects of garlic and its products could offer significant therapeutic benefits for the prevention and treatment of PDAC. In the present review, the therapeutic potential of garlic on PDAC is summarized and discussed."

Many studies have been conducted to control grapevine diseases, but effective control methods after plant infections remain lacking. This study aimed to assess the antiviral potential of garlic extract, a natural substance that inhibits HSVds in grapevine plants after micropropagation. Garlic extract was diluted 1,000-fold and applied to grapevine plants, and its effect on HSVd accumulation was evaluated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and digital PCR. The results showed that HSVd accumulation was significantly reduced, with an inhibition rate of 74.45%; meanwhile, higher garlic extract concentrations resulted in contamination and plant damage. Nanopore sequencing confirmed that the integrity of the HSVd genome was compromised after treatment. Furthermore, garlic extract inhibited the HSVd and promoted plant growth by enhancing shoot and root development. Additionally, inhibition of the HSVd was sustained in regenerated grapevine plants. Moreover, the garlic extract showed inhibitory effects against HSVds in natural host cucumber plants. These results suggest that garlic extract could be a cost-effective and sustainable alternative for viroid control in grapevine cultivation, providing long-term protection and broader antiviral activity across plant species."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats using strepetozotocin at a single dose of (55 mg/kg of body weight, i.p) in citrate buffer. Polyherbal formulation was administred as a treatment for 8 weeks. UNLABELLED: Rats receiving treatment with polyherbal formulation showed decreased blood glucose, plasma creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatine kinase- myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, Troponin-I, NADPH oxidase 4, and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate-1. In contrast, Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione enzyme activities were increased. CONCLUSION: Thus, a polyherbal formulation containing herbs was able to attenuate the progression of diabetes mellitus and diabetic cardiomyopathy."

      "abstract": "Garlic (Allium sativum L.) has been consumed globally as a functional food and traditional medicine for various ailments. Its active organosulfur compounds (OSCs) have demonstrated significant anticancer properties, particularly against gastric cancer. However, a comprehensive review of these effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms, including their role in overcoming drug resistance, is currently lacking. This review systematically examines both preclinical and clinical studies on the anticancer effects of garlic and its organosulfur compounds against gastric cancer, with a focus on patents. Emphasis is placed on explaining the mechanisms of action, exploring how these compounds can overcome drug resistance, and highlighting relevant patents that have been granted in this field. The literature search included databases, like PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and patent databases, including articles and patents published up to October 2024. Preclinical studies demonstrate that garlic-derived organosulfur compounds possess anticancer activities against gastric cancer. They work through multiple mechanisms, including inducing apoptosis, causing cell cycle arrest, inhibiting cancer stem cell properties, suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and modulating key signaling pathways, like PI3K/Akt and NF-κB. These compounds also show potential in overcoming drug resistance by downregulating multidrug resistance proteins and enhancing the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy drugs. Clinical studies suggest that regular garlic consumption may reduce the risk of gastric cancer and improve outcomes in patients undergoing chemotherapy. This review highlights the significant potential of garlic's organosulfur compounds as complementary agents in gastric cancer prevention and treatment and emphasizes the relevance of existing patents and the need for further clinical trials to confirm these effects and develop effective therapeutic strategies."

This study sought to examine the Allium sativum ethanolic extract (ASEE) in inducing apoptosis in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 cells and the molecular interactions of the identified components with cell death markers using in silico method. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Cytotoxicity of ASEE was tested on MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and Normal Vero cells. The ROS production, apoptosis, MMP, and cell cycle study were conducted utilizing flow cytometer, and western blot was also performed for protein expression analysis. ASEE was phytochemically characterized by the HPLC while AutoDock Vina and iGEMDOCK tools investigated in-silico binding interactions. RESULTS: The HPLC method identified two active organosulfur chemicals, allicin and alliin, in ASEE. MTT test revealed significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of breast cancer cells proliferation. The inhibitory effect of ASEE was more pronounced in MDA-MB-231 cells than in MCF-7 cells, however, no substantial cytotoxicity was seen in normal Vero cells. TNBC cells treated with high concentrations of ASEE were found in the late apoptotic stage and exhibited an increase in ROS level and a reduction in MMP. ASEE exposure increased the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase. ASEE upregulated the p53 and Bax proteins while downregulated the Bcl-2, p-Akt, and p-p38 proteins. Allicin and alliin compounds had strong binding affinity with targeted proteins of breast cancer, and both compounds also showed good pharmacokinetics and druglikeness properties. CONCLUSION: ASEE could be useful in the treatment of human triple-negative breast cancer without any safety risks."

This study investigated the protective effects of black garlic (BG) ethanol extract against MSG-induced ovarian damage in rats. Thirty-two female rats in estrus were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8 per group): control (saline), BG (250 mg/kg BW), MSG (4 mg/g BW), and BG+MSG (combined treatment). Treatments were administered daily for 14 days. Ovarian tissues were collected for histopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC), and biochemical analyses. Histopathological examination revealed a significant reduction in cystic follicles in the BG+MSG group compared to the MSG group (p < 0.0001). IHC analysis showed decreased immunoreactivity of endothelin-1 and endothelin-2 in the BG+MSG group compared to the MSG group (both p < 0.01). Biochemical assays demonstrated significantly increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol levels in the BG+MSG group compared to the MSG group (all p < 0.05), while progesterone levels were significantly lower in the MSG group compared to the BG+MSG group (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that BG ethanol extract may mitigate MSG-induced ovarian dysfunction in rats by alleviating degenerative changes in follicles and modulating hormonal levels. This study provides insights into potential natural interventions for MSG-related reproductive toxicity."

This study evaluated the effects of shade-dried ground garlic leaf (GL) powder and papaya leaf (PL) powder as crop waste on feed intake, growth performance, ruminal microbial counts, gut epithelial barrier functions, and meat quality in goats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male adult Beetal goats were randomly divided into five treatment groups: (1) Control (basal diet only); (2) basal diet supplemented with 6% bromodichloromethane (BCM); (3) basal diet supplemented with 30% GL powder; (4) basal diet supplemented with 26% PL powder; and (5) basal diet supplemented with 30% GL powder and 26% PL powder (GP). RESULTS: Average weight gain, feed conversion ratio, fecal score, and albumin improved in the GP. Aspartate transferase increased significantly in BCM, GL, and PL and was insignificant in the GP group compared with the C group. There was a 13% decrease in methanogen count in PL compared with C, but this difference was not significant between BCM and GP. Ruminal bacteria and protozoa were lowest in GL. Ruminal papilla height and surface area increased in the supplemented groups compared with C (p < 0.05). In vitro experiments using isolated ruminal epithelia revealed a 39% increase in short-circuit current in GP compared with C (p < 0.05). For meat parameters, the pH 24 h decreased significantly in GL compared to BCM. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementations with GL and PL alone or in combination improved growth parameters and gut performance and reduced rumen methanogen levels without altering meat quality parameters. Proper diet formulation and further research on other ruminants may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock."

      "abstract": "Changes in chemical composition during food processing and handling are crucial for the alteration of food flavor and function, and accurate characterization of key chemical reaction pathways in complex food matrices is one of the core challenges in food chemistry research. Here, this study attempts to establish a strategy for sensitive characterization of chemical reactions during food processing based on on-line extraction electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (oEESI-MS). The process of making garlic into black garlic, a traditional global flavor food, was chosen as an exemplary research template. The direct MS characterization of raw garlic as well as black garlic samples with different processing times was achieved by using the self-constructed oEESI-MS device. Benefiting from the high tolerance of oEESI-MS to complex matrix interferences, all samples can be fingerprinted directly without any pre-processing or pre-separation. As a result, oEESI-MS achieved a sensitive characterization of the changes of key substances during the preparation of black garlic. Further, a new chemical reaction pathway, the degradation of γ-L-glutamyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine to S-allyl-l-cysteine, was completely demonstrated by analyzing the differential substances before and after the treatment, and verified by standard substances and chemical theory calculations. In conclusion, a complete oEESI-MS-based strategy for tracking the substance changes in food processing was established in this study, which has a widely applicable prospect for the precise setting of food processing time and parameters, and the innovation of processing technology.",

This plant contains many biologically active compounds, including polyphenols, sterols, cysteine-sulfoxides, carbohydrates, proteins, and amino acids. The aim of our study was to compare the antioxidant potential, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis induction properties of four garlic cultivars-Harnaś, Ornak, Violeta, and Morado-in human squamous carcinoma (SCC-15) cells, colon adenocarcinoma (CACO-2) cells, and normal fibroblasts (BJ). Additionally, we investigated the mRNA and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3A), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and catalase (CAT) after treatment with the studied garlic extracts. Our study demonstrated that high ROS production was correlated with the strong toxicity of the garlic extracts. All studied extracts produced a lesser increase in ROS in normal BJ fibroblasts and were less toxic to these cells. The expression patterns of PPARγ, LC3A, SOD1, and CAT, along with chromatographic analysis, suggest differing mechanisms among the garlic cultivars. The highest levels of catechin, a known PPARγ agonist, were detected in the Harnaś (3.892 µg/mL) and Ornak (3.189 µg/mL) cultivars. A high catechin content was correlated with similar changes in PPARγ and related SOD1 and LC3A. Our findings showed the health-promoting and anticancer properties of garlic. However, we could not definitively identify which polyphenol or how it is involved in PPARγ activation. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of PPARγ in the mechanism of action of garlic extracts.",

Antimicrobial peptides exhibit a wide spectrum of antimicrobial action, and thus, provide one of the first lines of host defense against oral pathogens. Aged garlic extract (AGE) is effective for preventing the progression of periodontal disease. The present study examined whether AGE affects the production of antimicrobial peptides in mouse gingiva. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that oral administration of AGE in mice increased the mRNA level of Defb4 in gingival tissue, while the levels of Defb1, Defb14 and Cramp remained unaffected. AGE also upregulated the protein levels of β-defensin 4. To explore the underlying mechanism of the increased β-defensin 4 production induced by AGE, a comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis in gingival tissues was performed. Proteomic profiling revealed activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway in gingiva of mice treated with AGE. Treatment of mouse gingival epithelial GE1 cells with AGE resulted in an increase of β-defensin 4 in the culture medium. In support of proteomics experiments, LF3, a specific inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suppressed the AGE-induced production of β-defensin 4. In addition, β-catenin protein was found to accumulate within the nucleus in cells treated with AGE. In conclusion, the present findings suggested that AGE enhanced the production of β-defensin 4 in mouse gingiva through the canonical Wnt signal transduction pathway."

The behavior of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Pseudomonas spp., aerobic bacteria, and yeasts and molds was then investigated. Color, pH, TBARS, and rheological properties were also measured. In hummus, both with and without garlic, chitosan added at 0.5% and 1% w/w significantly (p < 0.05) decreased LAB, aerobic bacteria, yeasts, and molds, and Pseudomonas spp., at 4 °C. However, at 10 °C, adding chitosan at 1% w/w significantly reduced only aerobic bacteria (2.2 log cfu/g) and Pseudomonas spp. (1.0 log cfu/g). The pH values (regardless of treatment) decreased upon storage. The addition of garlic or chitosan did not significantly affect the lightness (L*) or yellowness (b*). However, garlic, regardless of chitosan concentration, notably reduced lipid oxidation (0.8-1.4 MDA Eq/kg of sample) and had a greater impact on the sensory properties compared to chitosan. The results of this study will encourage producers to produce hummus that has a better flavor due to garlic with enhanced microbial quality."

      "abstract": "In recent years, the incidence of fungal infections has been rising annually, especially among immunocompromised populations, posing a significant challenge to public health. Although antifungal medications provide some relief, the escalating problem of resistance sharply curtails their effectiveness, presenting an urgent clinical dilemma that demands immediate attention. Research has shown that fungal resistance is closely related to quorum sensing (QS), and QS inhibitors (QSIs) are considered an effective solution to this issue. Garlic, as a natural QSI, has demonstrated significant effects in inhibiting fungal growth, preventing biofilm formation, enhancing immunity, and combating resistance. This study explores the potential of garlic in mitigating fungal drug resistance and identifies its key role in inhibiting the QS mechanism, these findings offer a new perspective for the treatment of fungal infections, especially in addressing the increasingly severe problem of resistance. However, the clinical application of garlic still faces several challenges, such as ensuring the standardization of active ingredient extraction, as well as issues of safety and stability. Future research should focus on the QS mechanism and promote interdisciplinary collaboration to develop more natural, effective, and safe QSI drugs like garlic, while actively conducting clinical trials to validate their efficacy and safety. Additionally, incorporating advanced technologies such as nanotechnology to enhance drug stability and targeting, provide a more comprehensive strategy for the treatment of fungal infections. Overall, Our study provides scientific evidence supporting the potential of garlic as a novel antifungal treatment and lays the groundwork for the development of future natural QSIs for therapeutic use. It offers new insights, particularly for the treatment of immunocompromised populations and drug-resistant fungal strains.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of thyme powder (TP), garlic powder (GP), and their combination as natural alternatives to antibiotics on broiler growth performance, blood indices, and carcass characteristics. A completely randomized design was used, with four experimental groups consisting of 264 one-day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks (45.27±0.5 g). Each group received different levels of TP and GP in the diet as follows: a control group (basal diet with no additives), 2 g of GP/kg, 2 g of TP/kg, and a mixture treatment (1 g of GP/kg + 1 g of TP/kg). Each treatment included six replicates, with eleven unsexed chicks per replicate. The results showed that supplementation with TP, GP, and their combination significantly improved feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and overall growth performance compared to the untreated group (UG). The different additives also significantly (P≤0.05) enhanced carcass characteristics, particularly carcass yield and heart weight, both in absolute and relative terms. Furthermore, the treatments significantly (P≤0.05) affected blood indices, leading to notable improvements in immune and antioxidant parameters, including increased levels of immunoglobulin Y (IgY), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as decreased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress. These changes suggest that the supplemented groups had enhanced immunity and a better oxidative balance, contributing to improved overall health. Notably, the combined treatment of TP and GP (1% each) exhibited a synergistic effect, yielding benefits comparable to or even surpassing those of the individual TP or GP treatments. These findings support the potential of combining these natural additives to achieve a balanced improvement in growth, feed efficiency, and health status. In conclusion, supplementation with thyme powder, garlic powder, or a combination of both at appropriate levels (2% GP, 2% TP, or 1% each) can serve as an effective alternative to antibiotics, improving broiler growth performance, carcass quality, and health by enhancing immune responses and antioxidant status.",

Therefore, this study aims to explore the in vitro antioxidant, antibacterial, and antitumor activities of A. ursinum extracts according to their functional phytochemical profile, while assessing whether ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) enhances bioactive properties in comparison to conventional maceration (CM). Both extracts were characterized by spectrophotometric methods and LC-ESI+-MS. The antioxidant activity was assessed via the CUPRAC and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays, the antimicrobial properties via the disk-diffusion method against five pathogenic strains, and the antitumor activity via the MTT assay on four cancer cell lines. The major constituents of the methanolic extracts from leaves were kaempferol derivatives and alliin. The quercetin derivative rutin was also found. Maceration assisted using UAE yielded 20% more bioactive compounds in comparison to CM alone. Employing UAE in the extraction significantly increased antioxidant and antimicrobial proprieties, in line with its chemical composition. The antitumor cytotoxic activity was low to moderate, regardless of method, as explained by the absence of highly cytotoxic compounds. Wild garlic extracts possessed strong antioxidant and substantial antibacterial activities.",

      "abstract": "Current crop management worldwide is shifting toward the use of environmentally friendly products. With this objective, we developed a new phytosanitary product with biostimulant properties based on the encapsulation of garlic extract at a lower dose (<0.1%) in chitosan nanoparticles as a seed nano-priming agent. In the present study, the morphology of the nanoparticles, their stability under prolonged storage conditions, and their efficacy as a biostimulant are evaluated on cereals in rainfed crops, and the activities were correlated with a transcriptomic analysis. The nanoparticles showed a spherical shape and had a maximum size close to 200 nm with satisfactory stability at 4 °C, reducing the probability of aggregation processes in the nanoparticles. The biostimulant properties of the nano-priming agent were evaluated in a field experiment with wheat, barley, and oat seeds at 30 and 90 days, showing that plants treated with nanoparticles showed significant differences with higher values in root development, leaf length, and total plant weight. Finally, through a RNA-SEQ analysis of the treated wheat seeds, we have confirmed that the nano-treatment showed a higher increases in regard to development, metabolism, and plant response genes compared with untreated seeds."

Broiler chickens (900 males 1-day-old, Ross 308) were randomly assigned to six treatment diets (0, 75, or 150 mg/kg free GEO and 0 [containing chitosan], 75, or 150 mg/kg nanoencapsulated GEO) in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. The inclusion of nanoencapsulated GEO with a concentration of 75 mg/kg significantly increased the growth performance (p < 0.05) of the birds fed the diet containing free GEO (75 mg/kg). Also, GEO nanocapsules significantly reduced serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to the control diet (p < 0.05) (42 days), sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody titer (35 and 42 days), heterophilus (H): lymphocyte (L), and H ratio, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) (42 days) (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the findings show that the amount of 75 (mg/kg) of the nanoencapsulated GEO, compared to the free GEO, causes more growth performance and strengthens the immune system of broiler chickens.",

      "abstract": "Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. Colon cancer, also known as Caco-2, is caused by multiple epigenetic alterations and involves unregulated proliferation, differentiation, and invasion of neighboring tissues. Colon cancer patients have had surgery, radiation, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. This study investigates a new experimental method using inexpensive and environmentally friendly Egyptian plant extracts. DMSO-dissolved ginger, garlic, cinnamon, and chamomile were employed in this investigation. HPLC and GC-MS were used to analyze plant extracts. These extracts were tested for colon cancer efficacy using various methods. These methods included Caco-2 cells, MTT test, Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and ELISA. Garlic and ginger were found to be cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells. Compared to cinnamon and chamomile extracts, garlic and ginger have boosted LDH synthesis significantly. Garlic and ginger also altered autophagy genes (Bectin1, Atg5, PTEN) and Caspase-3 expression pathways on proapoptotic signaling. Garlic and ginger increased cleaved PTEN and caspase-3 and decreased Atg5 and Bectin1. Ginger and garlic caused extrinsic apoptosis and prevented Atg5 and Bectin1 phosphorylation. The average IL-8 and IL-6 levels increased significantly after 24 hours, according to ELISA. In conclusion, garlic and ginger extracts modify pro-inflammatory cytokines. Alternative herbal remedies like garlic and ginger may be effective and safe colon cancer treatments.",

This study aimed to characterize a double crosslinked hydrogel formed with alginate, calcium ions (Ca2+), and garlic protein hydrolysates (GPH), and to develop hydrogel beads for targeted delivery of bioactive constituents to the gastrointestinal tract. RESULTS: The results indicated that the degree of GPH hydrolysis was approximately 3% following trypsin treatment. The inner structure of the double crosslinked hydrogel showed a honeycomb pattern, with solid-like gel rheology and improved texture properties at a 4% (w/v) GPH concentration. The GPH-based hydrogel beads demonstrated pH sensitivity, swelling in near-neutral and alkaline environments, and the encapsulated paclitaxel (PTX) exhibited an amorphous phase with preferential release in intestinal conditions. The GPH group also achieved greater drug encapsulation efficiency than a soy protein hydrolysate (SPH) group, and proteomic analysis suggested that lower molecular weight and peptide charge favored the formation of peptide-integrated double crosslinking hydrogels. CONCLUSION: This work indicated that GPH was helpful and could inspire the development of drug delivery systems involving GPH with the required mechanical strength and target-release properties. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Continuous vegetable production under plastic tunnels faces challenges like soil degradation, increased soil-borne pathogens, and diminished eggplant yield. These factors collectively threaten the long-term sustainability of food security by diminishing the productivity and resilience of agricultural soils. This research examined the use of raw garlic stalk (RGS) waste and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as a sustainable solution for these issues in eggplant monoculture. We hypothesized that the combined application of RGS waste and AMF would improve soil physicochemical properties compared to untreated soil in eggplant monoculture. The combined use of RGS and AMF was expected to suppress soil-borne pathogens, increase the abundance of soil beneficial microorganisms and alter fungal community structure. The combined application of RGS and AMF will significantly enhance eggplant yield compared to untreated plots. This study aimed to determine whether AMF and RGS, individually or in combination, can ameliorate the adverse effects of monoculture on eggplant soil. We also investigated whether these treatments could enhance eggplant yield. METHODS: The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with four treatments: AMF, RGS, and a combined treatment of AMF + RGS (ARGS), along with a control. Each treatment was replicated three times, Eggplant seedlings inoculated with AMF and treated with RGS amendments, both individually and combined. The effects on root traits, soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activity, and fungal community structure were investigated. RESULTS: RGS amendments and AMF inoculation improved root length, volume, and mycorrhizal colonization. The combined treatment showed the most significant improvement. RGS and AMF application increased soil nutrient availability (N, P, K) and organic matter content. Enzyme activities also increased with RGS and AMF treatments, with the combined application showing the highest activity. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) increased, while soil pH decreased with RGS and AMF amendments. Sequencing revealed a shift in the fungal community structure. Ascomycota abundance decreased, while Basidiomycota abundance increased with RGS and AMF application. The combined treatment reduced the abundance of pathogenic genera (Fusarium) and enriched beneficial taxa (Chaetomium, Coprinellus, Aspergillus). Pearson correlations supported the hypothesis that soil physicochemical properties influence fungal community composition. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of co-applying RGS and AMF in continuous cropping systems. It enhances soil physicochemical properties, reduces soil-borne pathogens, and promotes beneficial microbial communities and eggplant yield. This combined approach offers a sustainable strategy to address the challenges associated with eggplant monoculture under plastic tunnels.",

S-allyl cysteine (SAC) is a promising garlic-derived organosulfur compound with many positive effects in cell models and living systems. SAC has biological activity in various fields, enclosing healing in learning and memory disorders, neurotrophic effects, and antioxidant activity. In this study, we purposed to identify the neuroprotective activity of SAC toward 6-OHDA-induced cell demise in the SH-SY5Ycell line. For this purpose, 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity, and biochemical, and gene expression changes were evaluated in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells grown in cell culture were treated with SAC 24 h before and after 6-OHDA application. Then, cell viability, antioxidant parameters, and gene expressions were measured. Finally, immunofluorescence staining analysis was performed. Our results showed that SAC increased cell viability by 144 % at 80 µg/mL with pre-incubation (2 h). It was observed that antioxidant levels were significantly increased and oxidative stress marker levels were decreased in cells exposed to 6-OHDA after pre-treatment with SAC (p<0.05). SAC supplementation also suppressed the increase in pro-inflammation levels (TNF-α/IL1/IL8) caused by 6-OHDA (p < 0.05). While 8-OHdG and Nop10 expressions were observed at a mild level in SAC pretreatment depending on the dose, 8-OHdG, and Nop10 expressions were observed at a moderate level in SAC treatment after 6-OHDA application (p<0.05). Our findings demonstrate the positive effect of pretreatment with SAC on SH-SY5Y cells injured by 6-OHDA, suggesting that SAC may be beneficial for neuroprotection in regulating oxidative stress and neuronal survival in an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease."

Garlic scapes, a member of the Allium sativum family and a rich source of antioxidants, are utilized in various cuisine preparations due to their unique flavors and tastes. The current study examined garlic scape powder's effect on apoprotein E and its ability to decrease cholesterol. In an in vivo experiment, normal, healthy Wistar albino rats (weeks) were divided into a negative control group (NC, n = 10) and a high-fat diet-raised group (n = 50) until they achieved cholesterol ≥250 mg/dL. Hypercholesteremic rats were further divided randomly into five groups: positive control (PC), standard group (fenofibrate 20 mg/kg bwt), and treatment groups G1, G2, and G3 that were administered with garlic scape powder 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg/kg bwt orally, respectively, for 3 months. The blood samples were examined for cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), low-density lipoproteins, apoprotein E, albumin levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The liver tissues of the rats were subjected to histopathology. The lipid profile was assessed using serum kit techniques, whereas an ELISA kit was used to evaluate apoprotein E, and a serum kit was used to estimate ALT and AST. In comparison to all other groups except NC, the highest dose of 1200 mg/kg bwt of garlic scapes significantly (p ≤ .05) increased serum insulin (13.66 ± 0.72 μU/mL), apoprotein E levels (6.08 ± 0.10 mg/dL), HDL (42.1 ± 1.81 mg/dL), and reduce TG (88.7 ± 1.64 mg/dL) and decreased overall cholesterol levels (67.9 ± 1.17 mg/dL). Except for NC, all treatment groups had significantly (p ≤ .05) lower ALT and AST values than PC. To sum up, powdered garlic scapes may be a great way to avoid hyperlipidemia, which raises the risk of cardiovascular illnesses. ALT and AST levels were significantly (p ≤ .05) reduced in all treatment groups compared to PC, except for NC. In conclusion, garlic scape powder may be an excellent source to prevent hyperlipidemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In addition, powdered garlic scapes supplementation at high doses may be used as an alternative natural source in functional foods to halt hyperlipidemia without liver toxicity in the long term."

A completely randomized design was used, involving 90 turkey broilers aged 1-56 days, with five treatments and three replicates per treatment. The birds were given feed and water ad libitum for the entire experiment period. The treatments included the supplementation of aqueous extract from fermented garlic (FG) to drinking water. The results showed that broilers supplemented with 0.8% FG exhibited the largest final body weight (1,158 g/bird), body weight gain (19.64 g/bird/day), and significantly improved feed conversion ratio (1.962) while decreasing the feed intake of turkey broilers from to 1-56 days. The immune organ indices, including the spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius indices, were increased in the 0.6% FG treatment group (P<0.05), while antibody titers (at 28 and 42 days of age) were improved in the 0.6% and 0.8% FG treatments (P<0.05). Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not detected in the intestines of these birds, while the amount of Escherichia coli was reduced (P<0.05) and Lactobacillus spp. increased (P>0.05) without a significant effect. It can be concluded that supplementation with 0.8% FG improved growth performance, and 0.6% FG may enhance the immunity of turkeys. Moreover, 0.6% and 0.8% FG could be widely used for poultry production.",

Since diet plays a fundamental role in shaping the gut microbiome, understanding the relationship between food consumption and microbiome structure is essential. Although medicinal plants are widely recognized for their broad health benefits, their specific impact on the gut microbiome remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of garlic (Allium sativum) on the gut microbiome using an in vitro human fecal incubation model. Our findings revealed that the impact of garlic on gut microbial structure varied depending on the dominant gut microbiome components (enterotypes). The Bacteroides-dominant enterotype exhibited significant changes in overall microbial diversity in response to garlic, while the Prevotella-dominant enterotype remained unaffected. Additionally, the garlic treatment led to specific alterations in microbiota composition, such as an increase in beneficial probiotics like Bifidobacterium. We validated garlic's prebiotic potential by promoting the growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis under in vitro culture conditions. Our study highlights the importance of understanding enterotype-specific responses to diet and suggests that garlic may serve as a dietary supplement for modulating gut microbiota and promoting the growth of beneficial probiotics."

      "abstract": "For a given aquatic ecosystem that will be used as a water source, it is necessary to establish the quality of the water from a microbiological point of view by identifying the pathogens present in the water. The aim of this study was to determine and analyze the antimicrobial activity of some biocides derived from garlic (garlic-methanol extract) and lavender (lavender-water extract). Their efficiency was evaluated at different concentrations and contact times. Initially, through specific laboratory analyses, the microbiological characteristics of the river were determined. Biomimetic studies on the antimicrobial activity of biocides based on garlic and lavender in surface waters involved detailed exploration of how the natural antimicrobial properties of these plants can be effectively utilized to treat water contaminated with harmful microorganisms. Both the contact time and the amount of biocide used have a significant effect on the microorganisms of interest. Thus, to describe the degradation rate of coliform bacteria, a pseudo-first-order and zero-order kinetic model was used, r=-(dN/dt)=kobs·t şi r0=kobs·N0=k0, where r is the rate of degradation of microorganisms (CFU/min), N0 is the initial number of microorganisms in the aqueous solution (colony-forming unit, CFU), N is the final number of microorganisms after a contact time t (CFU), kobs is the pseudo-first-order rate constant (min-1), t is the contact time (min), r0 is the initial rate of degradation of microorganisms (CFU/min), and k0 is the pseudo-rate constant zero order (min-1). Following 60 min of treatment with 1 mL of lavender-water biocide, the inhibition rate of pathogenic microorganisms in the water reached 59.09%, whereas, under the same conditions, the garlic-methanol biocide achieved an inhibition rate of 40.86%. This study confirms the antimicrobial activity of both lavender and garlic biocides, highlighting their potential in mitigating water pollution caused by pathogens."

Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) under various conditions, including contact time, contact temperature, initial dye concentration, and initial pH value. The equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to different kinetic and isothermal models, and the adsorption thermodynamics were also calculated. Significant Findings: The physicochemical properties of the GP-based bio-adsorbents were primarily dominated by the pyrolysis temperature, because their morphologies and surface functional groups of GP-based bio-adsorbents significantly varied with the changes in pyrolysis temperature. The adsorption capacity of GP materials for MB decreased as the pyrolysis temperature increased. At an initial concentration of 50.00 mg L-1, GP150 possessed a higher adsorption capacity of 167.74 mg g-1 toward MB. The possible adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, including electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking, were recognized. After 10 consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles, GP150 maintained a high removal rate (88%) for MB, demonstrating its excellent adsorption performance, good reusability, and potential application in the treatment of MB-contaminated water."

The stimulatory effects of Ulva sp. extract (UE) and garlic powder extract (GPE) on the growth performance and innate immune responses of white-leg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, and their challenge against V. harveyi infection were also investigated. A commercial shrimp diet (36.1% protein) was enriched with 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g UE/kg diet and 2, 4 and 6 g GPE/kg diet, whereas the control group was free of any supplement. Health juveniles of L. vannamei (average weight 2-3 g) were distributed in 21 fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) tanks (500-L capacity) at a stocking density of 300 animals/tank to represent each treatment in triplicate. The animals were fed ad libitum on the experimental diets up to satiety four times daily for 60 days. The phytochemical analysis of ethanolic extracts of Ulva sp. and garlic powder evoked their richness of several bioactive compounds showing significant antibacterial activity against V. harveyi. The GPE exhibited a higher inhibition zone than that of the UE. The supplemented diets did not significantly affect weight gain %, final weight, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate and survival rates of white shrimp compared to those fed on the control diet. Significant increases were observed in total haemocyte count, phagocytosis and phagocytic index of all treatments compared with the control group. There were significant increases in serum total protein, acid phosphatase activity, alkaline phosphatase, lysosomal enzyme activity, phenoloxidase activity and superoxide dismutase activity with offered diets with increasing the levels of ethanolic extracts of Ulva sp. and garlic powder up to 2.0 g UE/kg diet and 6 g GPE/kg diet, respectively. The ethanolic extraction of Ulva sp. and garlic powder-supplemented diet groups, particularly at treatments of 2.0 and 6 g GPE/kg diet, respectively, significantly reduced the shrimp mortality induced by V. harveyi infection when compared with the control group. The net results evoked that ethanolic extraction of Ulva sp. (2.0 g UE/kg) and garlic powder (6 g GPE/kg diet) enhanced the immune response and disease resistance of the white-leg shrimp, L. vannamei. It is also noted that the GPE is more efficient than the UE in vitro and in vivo investigations.",

To achieve these goals, trials with different film cover methods were conducted at the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Nanjing. To investigate the impact of changes in soil quality and garlic yield, we set up four treatments： no film treatment （CK）, black polyethylene film treatment （HPE）, black poly（butylene- adipate-co-terephthalate） （PBAT） with straw composite film treatment （HSJ）, and white PBAT film treatment （BJ） in a garlic cropping system. Our results indicated that specific mulch coverings had a positive effect on both soil quality and garlic yield. The film cover treatments resulted in significant changes in soil physicochemical properties and bacterial and fungal biomasses and indirectly improved soil quality. Compared to that under the no film treatment, the BJ treatment boosted soil quality by 70%, with the most significant impact, followed by that under the HPE and HSJ treatments, with improvements of 52% and 36%. Random forest modeling indicated that soil organic matter and total nitrogen were the most important factors influencing soil quality. The different film covers significantly increased the diameter of garlic bulbs and single quality. The HSJ treatment exhibited the most significant increase in garlic yield, with 46%, 19%, and 6% improvement compared to that in the CK, HPE, and BJ treatments, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that soil quality under film cover was significantly correlated with the starch content of garlic bulbs, garlic diameter, and single quality. This study highlights that selecting the appropriate mulch film aids in the production of garlic and helps to develop farmland that produces both high-quality and high-yield crops.",

This research aims to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation with garlic alone, vitamins A, D3, E alone, and their combination on heat detection, pregnancy rate and serum profile in anestrus dairy cows. Using a completely randomized design, this study, conducted over 327 days, evaluated 72 anestrus-affected cows, which were divided into four groups. T0 (Control) received only normal saline; T1 with vitamin A,D3,E; T2 with Garlic and T3 integrated with A, D3, E + Garlic in drinking water. Results demonstrated that the treatment groups exhibited significantly higher estrus signs (p < 0.05) compared to the control. The pregnancy rate was also increased (P = 0.059), especially in the T3 group which had the highest heat detection (55.55 %), conception (70 %), and pregnancy (38.88 %). In comparison, the heat detection rate for T1 was 44.44 %, while the conception rate for T2 was 66.66 %. Additionally, T0 exhibited the least proportion across all parameters. Additionally, the elevated BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and blood glucose levels observed in non-responsive (those not showing signs of heat) cows at 32.51 and 43.65 mg/dl respectively, compared to responsive cows (those showing signs of heat) with levels of 22.40 and 51.34 mg/dl. These findings suggest a potential association between these blood parameters and the cyclicity of dairy cows. These findings highlight that oral supplementation with vitamin AD3E+Garlic significantly improves the heat detection rate and pregnancy rate than only administering vitamin AD3E or Garlic with anestrus in dairy cattle."

Black garlic is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; however, there is a lack of studies on the potential hepatoprotective effect of black garlic ethanol extract (BGE) against MSG-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of ethanol extract of black garlic against MSG-induced liver damage in animal model. Twenty-five male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups (n=5): negative control, MSG only, and MSG with three different doses of BGE. The MSG only and MSG with BGE groups were orally administered with 8 mg/kg MSG daily. After MSG treatment, the MSG with BGE groups received BGE orally at daily doses of 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg body weight for 16 consecutive days. Subsequently, the levels of serum liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were measured. Our data indicated that the group treated with 200 mg/kg BGE had significant lower levels of AST and ALT significantly compared to the MSG-only group. The MSG-treated group had higher levels of the inflammatory markers COX-2 and IFN-γ, which were lowered by administration of 200 mg/kg BGE. In contrast, higher doses of BGE led to greater levels of COX-2 and IFN-γ compared to those in the MSG-only group. This study suggested that BGE might have hepatoprotective effects at low dose, potentially mitigating MSG-induced liver damage. However, the higher dose of black garlic extract did not alleviate inflammation, as shown by the higher levels of COX-2 and IFN-γ.",

      "abstract": "Infertility rates have risen significantly, one of which is due to monosodium glutamate (MSG) consumption. Recent studies have shown that flavonoids in black garlic (Allium sativum) act as antioxidants. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of black garlic extract (BGE) on gonadosomatic index, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and spermatozoa quality in rats exposed to MSG. Twenty-five healthy rats, aged ten to twelve weeks, were divided equally into five experimental groups: (1) negative control (NC), no intervention; (2) positive control (PC), fed with MSG 8 mg/kg; and (3) fed with MSG + BGE 200 mg/kg; (4) fed with MSG + BGE 400 mg/kg; and (5) fed with MSG + BGE 600 mg/kg. Oral MSG was administered once a day for two weeks before BGE administration was started for two weeks. The measured endpoints were gonadosomatic index, FSH levels, and spermatozoa concentration and quality (spermatozoa motility and abnormality). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan's post hoc analysis was used to assess the measurement differences. The result suggested that the administration of BGE did not significantly affect the gonadosomatic index (p=0.513). Significant decreases in FSH levels (p=0.005) and spermatozoa concentration were observed in the PC group compared to other groups (p<0.001). Additionally, spermatozoa motility was significantly lower in the PC group compared to NC, BGE200, BGE400, and BGE600 (p<0.001), with higher motility noted in BGE200, BGE400, and BGE600 compared to PC (p<0.001). Furthermore, PC had significantly higher spermatozoa abnormalities compared to NC, BGE200, BGE400, and BGE600 (p<0.001). In conclusion, administration of BGE had a significant effect on the improvement of FSH levels and the quality of spermatozoa in rats exposed to MSG.",

It explores the historical uses of garlic in different cultures for medicinal purposes and delves into the phytochemical composition of garlic, highlighting key components, like allicin and ajoene, that are believed to contribute to its potential health benefits. Clinical studies that investigated the effects of garlic and garlic-based supplements on blood pressure are presented, with the findings suggesting that garlic consumption may modestly reduce blood pressure, particularly in individuals with mild hypertension. Potential mechanisms of action include increased nitric oxide production, improved endothelial function, and antioxidant properties. While garlic may offer some benefits for blood pressure management, it should not be considered a substitute for conventional antihypertensive medications. Further large-scale, long-term clinical trials are warranted to establish the efficacy of garlic in managing hypertension, including the optimal dosage and formulation.",

Garlic powder (GP) possesses antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The aim was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation of GP on growth performance, carcass traits and meat quality of the Japanese quail. A total of 240, day-old mixed gender Japanese quail were assigned to 4 treatment groups, each group being replicated 4 times and containing 15 birds in each replication. Birds were provided with either a basal diet (control) or basal diet supplemented with 0.5%, 1% and 2% GP for 5 wk. At slaughter age, birds fed 1% GP had higher (P < 0.05) live weight and body weight gain when compared to the control. Supplementation with different levels of GP had no influence (P > 0.05) on feed intake, feed conversion ratio except 3rd wk, carcass traits and abdominal fat. Thiobarbituric acid, peroxide and pH values in breast meat of birds receiving GP (1% or 2%) after storage (0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 d) were lower (P < 0.05) than the birds in control. Furthermore, total psychrophilic bacteria count was lower in breast meat of birds supplemented with GP at any dose compared to the birds of control. Sensory characteristics such as color, aroma, juiciness and tenderness were observed significantly better (P < 0.05) in GP supplemented groups especially when fed 1% GP. In conclusion, supplementing the diet with 1% to 2% GP demonstrated growth-promoting effects and positively impacted meat quality, including sensory characteristics.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients with complaints of ED (with normal penile Doppler) who failed to maintain sustained improvement in erectile function with tadalafil were recruited after excluding those with comorbidities. The study sample was randomized into two groups. Group A received garlic 5 g twice a day orally and Group B received a placebo twice daily orally for 4 weeks. Both groups continued tadalafil 5 mg in the night for 4 weeks. Their erectile function was assessed at the beginning and at the end of 4 weeks using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF), erectile function domain and compared. A value of P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Nineteen patients in Group A (mean age 37.5 ± 10.6 years) and 16 patients in Group B (mean age 39.6 ± 9.6 years) participated in the pilot study conducted from May 2022 to August 2022. The participants treated with garlic (as an H2S donor) as a coadministrant had statistically significant improvement in IIEF-EF score (P ≤ 0.0001) at the end of 4 weeks compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Garlic (as an H2S donor) as adjunctive therapy was beneficial in our study participants responding poorly to tadalafil alone.",

However, the stimulatory effects of polysaccharides under immunosuppressive conditions and their link with the polysaccharide structure is underexplored. In this work, the immune modulatory effects of a garlic polysaccharide (GP) are investigated via in vitro and vivo methods. It is observed that GP enhance the immune response of macrophages (RAW264.7) as indicated by the elevated levels of nitric oxide, TNF-α and IL-6. The observation that GP are able to stimulate the immune response in vitro was then explored with the use of an immunosuppressed mouse model. Surprisingly, GP exhibited dose-dependent up-regulatory impacts on the cyclophosphamide (CTX) suppressed levels of cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-6 and immunoglobulins (e.g. IgA and IgG). The GP intervention reversed histopathological damage to the small intestine and spleen and increased fecal short-chain fatty acid levels. Moreover, GP modulates the gut microbiota dysbiosis by increasing the abundance of immunogenic bacteria such as g__norank_f__Erysipelotrichaceae, while inhibiting the over-abundance of g_Bacteroides. Functional predictions indicated that gut biomarkers of GP possessed the functions of glycoside hydrolase family 32 (GH32) and β-fructofuranosidase.

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Garlic extract (GE) has been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic rats (DRs) by increasing insulin production. However, the mechanism through which it exerts its effects remains unclear. Here, it investigates the molecular process and the origin of regenerating β-cell in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in response to GE. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis are carried out after pancreas isolation. These findings show that 1 week of GE treatment increases the expression of the endocrine progenitor cell markers Neurogenin3 (Neurog3), pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (Neurod1), paired box proteins (Pax)4, V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B (Mafb), and NK homeobox factors (Nkx)6-1 in STZ-induced DRs. Continuation with GE treatment for 8 weeks causes the expression of the mature β-cell markers insulin(Ins)2, urocortin3 (Ucn3), and glucose transporter 2 (Glut2) to peak. Comprehensive examination of the islet through immunohistochemical analysis reveals the presence of a heterogeneous cell population including INS+/GLUT2- and INS+/GLUT2+ β-cell subpopulations with few bihormonal INS+/GCG+ cells after 4 weeks. By week 8, islet architecture is reestablished, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was restored through the upregulation of Ucn3. CONCLUSION: GE induces β-cell neogenesis in DRs and restores islet architecture. The newly formed mature β-like cells could have originated through the differentiation of endocrine progenitor cells as well as α- to β-cell transdifferentiation.",

Subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia are frequently advised against using cholesterol-lowering drugs due to potential side effects, with an emphasis instead on prioritizing dietary adjustments and lifestyle modifications as the primary strategy. In this context, the use of dietary supplements based on medicinal plants may be recommended as a complementary approach to managing elevated cholesterol levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic effectiveness of a standardized formulation containing extracts from garlic and onions in addressing the health concerns of individuals with slightly elevated cholesterol levels. A controlled, randomized, double-blind, two parallel-group study was conducted over 8 weeks, with clinical visits scheduled at baseline, weeks 2 and 4, as well as at the end of the study. The results revealed significant reductions in both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels among participants who received the extract. Additionally, improvements in blood pressure, as well as in oxidative and inflammatory markers were observed, thus suggesting its potential as a valuable therapeutic intervention for managing mild hypercholesterolemia.",

Garlic-derived exosomes (GDEs) are nanoparticles extracted from garlic that exhibit anti-inflammatory effects on other diseases, but the effect of GDEs on OA has not been elucidated. In this study, GDEs were extracted and characterized. Chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β and incubated with GDEs in vitro, and the expression of cartilage matrix components (collagen II and aggrecan) and matrix degrading enzymes (MMP3 and MMP9) was evaluated via Western blotting. Changes in the MAPK pathway was also examined using Western blotting. The transcriptomic changes associated with GDE intervention were evaluated using high-throughput RNA-seq method. In vivo, we used anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) combined with destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery to establish a mouse OA model, and GDEs was intraarticularly injected into the joint cavity. The therapeutic effect of GDE was evaluated by behavioral and histopathological analysis. The results showed that IL-1β treatment inhibited the expression of collagen II and aggrecan, and upregulated the expression of MMP3 and MMP9, while GDE intervention alleviated these effects. GDEs also inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and P38. In vivo, GDE alleviated the sensitivity to heat stimulation and altered walking gait in a mouse OA model. Histopathological analysis indicated that GDE intervention ameliorated joint destruction in the knee joint without obvious toxicity. The results proved that GDEs alleviated the progression of OA in vitro and in vivo, and may be a potential disease-modifying drug for OA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vital pulp therapy procedures in primary dentition focuses on preservation and maintenance of pulp tissue that has been compromised due to caries, trauma, etc. Several pulp dressing materials have been used in primary teeth and some natural materials from the field of traditional medicine have also been introduced as medicaments in vital pulp therapy. The understanding of biologic and cytotoxic properties of newer materials is important for safe clinical usage. The biologic compatibility of these newer materials is imperative to limit or avoid tissue irritation or degeneration. AIM: To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of Allium sativum on cultured human primary dental pulp fibroblasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary pulp fibroblasts were cultured from the pulp tissue obtained from extracted deciduous primary canines and central incisor teeth. The freshly prepared concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, 125, and 62.5 µg/mL A. sativum extract were added to the 96-well plate in triplicates to which culture medium containing fourth passage cell suspension was added previously. Cells without treatment served as control, while cells treated with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) served as toxic control. After the addition of experimental and control agents, cells were incubated for 24 and 48 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. After the incubation period, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to determine the number of viable cells. Absorbance was read with a microplate reader at 570 nm wavelength and the relative viability of dental pulp fibroblasts at various concentrations was expressed as color intensity of the experimental wells relative to that of control. The percentage of cell viability was also calculated accordingly. RESULTS: The MTT assay results revealed that A. sativum extract, in all the concentrations tested at both the time intervals maintained a cell viability of greater than 90%. At 24 hours, the mean absorbance value of untreated control wells was recorded as 0.84400 ± 0.00916 with 100% cell viability. Among all the concentrations of garlic extract tested, highest mean absorbance value of 0.83933 ± 0.00550 with 99.44% cell viability was recorded for 62.5 µg/mL concentration. At 48 hours, the mean absorbance value of untreated control wells was recorded as 1.22767 ± 0.01106 with 100% cell viability, and the highest mean absorbance value of 1.22567 ± 0.01006 with 99.83% cell viability was recorded for 62.5 µg/mL concentration. The cell viability did not seem to be affected by the concentration of A. sativum extract at 24 hours. However, at 48 hours, the sensitivity of the cells was observed to be dependent on the concentration of A. sativum with a decrease in the viability of cells noted with the increase in concentration. CONCLUSION: A. sativum extract is noncytotoxic in nature and preserves the vitality of cultured human primary dental pulp fibroblasts making it a suitable material for use in vital pulp therapy procedures of primary teeth.

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, manifest as a result of intricate interactions involving genetic predisposition, environmental factors, intestinal microbiota dynamics, and immune dysregulation, ultimately leading to persistent mucosal inflammation. Addressing this complex pathology requires a nuanced understanding to inform targeted therapeutic strategies. Consequently, our study explored the viability of Aged Garlic Extract (AGE) as an alternative therapeutic regimen for IBD management. Utilizing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we characterized AGE, revealing distinctions from Fresh Garlic Extract (FGE), particularly the absence of allicin in AGE and accompanying structural alterations. In In-Vivo experiments employing an IBD rat model, AGE intervention exhibited remarkable antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Noteworthy outcomes included improved survival rates, mitigation of intestinal damage, restoration of gut microbial diversity, reinforcement of tight junctions, and reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction. Collectively, these effects contributed to the preservation of enterocyte integrity and the attenuation of inflammation. In conclusion, the unique chemical composition of AGE, coupled with its substantial influence on gut microbiota, antioxidant defenses, and inflammatory pathways, positions it as a promising adjunctive therapy for the management of IBD. These observations, synergistically considered with existing research, provide significant insights into the potential utility of AGE in addressing the intricate pathophysiology inherent to IBD. The potential strength of study and rationale of using AGE against IBD includes exploring alternative therapeutic regimens if conventional treatments are associated with side effects, identification of potential hotspots/pathways involved in disease progression and study can provide economically cheaper and naturally occurring alternative to patient community who are struggling to afford expensive medications. These promising findings underscore the necessity for additional investigations to ascertain the feasibility of clinical translation, thereby substantiating the potential therapeutic role of AGE in the management of IBD."

Selenium as a micronutrient is important for immunity and also has anti-viral activity. OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the activity of a Selenium enriched garlic powder (SeGP or SelenoForce®) against SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro and explored its possible mechanism of action. METHODS: The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity assay was carried out in Vero E6 cells in vitro. Human lung carcinoma A549 cells were used to study the antioxidant activity, expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the activity of proprotein convertase, and furin. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW 264.7 cells. RESULTS: SeGP inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with an IC50 of 19.59 μg/ml. It exhibited significant antioxidant activity in vitro with IC50 value determined as 43.45 μg/ml. The Selenium enriched product inhibited the expression of ACE and TMPRSS2 and also showed inhibition of furin protease activity. In the presence of SeGP, the secretion of nitric oxide, interleukin -6 and TNF-α were reduced in activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that Selenium enriched garlic powder could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in vitro, reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators suggesting that it could be developed as an effective supplement or adjunct therapy to combat viral infections."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Garlic is used as an important medicinal food for treatment of many diseases, however, the association between garlic consumption and dyslipidemia have yielded inconsistent results. So we carried this meta-analysis to explore the blood lipid-lowering effects of garlic. METHODS: Databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane Library were systematically searched until June 2024. Heterogeneity among studies was examined using Q and I2 statistics. Also subgroup analysis were conducted to explore the potential heterogeneity. Combined weighted mean differences (WMD) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. The GRADE approach was used to evaluate the overall certainty of the evidence in the meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 21 RCTs studies involved association between garlic consumption and blood lipids level of dyslipidemia patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that garlic consumption significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC)(WMD = -0.64mmol/L, 95%CI = -0.75 --0.54, P < 0.001), triglyceride (TG)(WMD = -0.17mmol/L, 95%CI = -0.26 --0.09, P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein(LDL-C)(WMD = -0.44mmol/L, 95%CI = -0.57 --0.31, P < 0.001) while slightly increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C)(WMD = 0.04mmol/L, 95%CI = -0.00 - 0.08, P < 0.001). And subgroup analyses showed that TC, TG and LDL-C significantly decreased in patients aged > 50 years compared to those aged ≤ 50 years. And garlic oil greatly reduced TC and LDL-C compared with garlic power. Finally, sensitivity analysis and publication bias showed that the results were reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this meta-analysis suggested that garlic consumption could be effective in reducing the risk of dyslipidemia and preventing CVDs. Particularly the older people were more susceptible to the protective effects of garlic.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic arterial pathology and a leading cause of vascular disease-related mortality. Fatty streaks in the arterial wall develop into atherosclerosis and characteristic plaques. Clinical interventions typically involve lipid-lowering medications and drugs for stabilizing vulnerable plaques, but no direct therapeutic agent specifically targets atherosclerosis. Garlic, also locally known as DASUAN, is recognized as a widely sold herbal dietary supplement esteemed for its cardiovascular benefits. However, the specific mechanisms of garlic's anti-atherosclerotic effects remain unclear. AIMS: This study aims to elucidate the pharmacological mechanisms through which garlic ameliorates atherosclerosis. METHODS: The study identified the major active components and targets of garlic by screening the TCMSP, TCM-ID, and, ETCM databases. Atherosclerosis-associated targets were obtained from the DisGeNET, GeneCards, and DiGSeE databases, and garlic intervention targets were determined through intersection. Utilizing the intersected genes, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using R software. A garlic component-disease target network was constructed using Cytoscape. RNA-seq datasets from the GEO database were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with atherosclerosis. The target genes were intersected with DEGs and the FerrDb (ferroptosis database). Molecular docking predicted the binding interactions between active components and the core targets. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated the identified core targets. RESULTS: The integration of garlic drug targets with atherosclerotic disease targets identified 230 target genes. Intersection with RNA-seq DEGs revealed 15 upregulated genes, including 8 target genes related to ferroptosis. Molecular docking indicated favorable affinities between garlic active components [Sobrol A, (+)-L-Alliin, Benzaldoxime, Allicin] and target genes (DPP4, ALOX5, GPX4). Experimental validation showed that GARLIC reduces the expression of ferroptosis-related genes in AS, suggesting its therapeutic potential through the regulation of ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: Garlic ameliorates atherosclerosis by targeting intra-plaque ferroptosis and reducing lipid peroxidation. These findings provide novel insights into the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the efficacy of garlic in treating AS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gills monogenean infestation causes significant mortalities in cultured fishes as a result of respiratory manifestation. Medicinal plants are currently being heavily emphasized in aquaculture due to their great nutritional, therapeutic, antimicrobial activities, and financial value. METHODS: The current study is designed to assess the effect of garlic (Allium sativum) and onion (Allium cepa) extracts as a water treatment on the hematological profile, innate immunity, and immune cytokines expression besides histopathological features of gills of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) infected with gills monogenetic trematodes (Dactylogyrus sp.). Firstly, the 96-hour lethal concentration 50 (96 h-LC50) of garlic extract (GE) and onion extract (OE) were estimated to be 0.4 g/ L and 3.54 g/ L for GE and OE, respectively. Moreover, the in-vitro anti-parasitic potential for (GE) was found between 0.02 and 0.18 mg/mL and 0.4 to 1.8 mg/mL for OE. For the therapeutic trial, fish (n = 120; body weight: 40-60 g) were randomly distributed into four groups in triplicates (30 fish/group, 10 fish/replicate) for 3 days. Group1 (G1) was not infected or treated and served as control. G2 was infected with Dactylogyrus spp. and not exposed to any treatment. G3, G4 were infected with Dactylogyrus sp. and treated with 1/10 and 1/5 of 96 h LC50 of OE, respectively. G5, G6 were infected with Dactylogyrus sp. and treated with 1/10 and 1/5 of 96 h LC50 of GE, respectively. RESULTS: No apparent signs or behaviors were noted in the control group. Dactylogyrus spp. infected group suffered from clinical signs as Pale color and damaged tissue. Dactylogyrus spp. infection induced lowering of the hematological (HB, MCH, MCHC and WBCs), and immunological variables (lysozyme, nitric oxide, serum Anti- protease activities, and complement 3). the expression of cytokine genes IL-ß and TNF-α were modulated and improved by treatment with A. sativum and A. cepa extracts. The obtained histopathological alterations of the gills of fish infected with (Dactylogyrus spp.) were hyperplasia leading to fusion of the gill filament, lifting of epithelial tissue, aneurism and edema. The results indecated that G4 and G5 is more regenarated epithelium in compare with the control group. CONCLUSION: A. sativum and A. cepa extracts enhance the blood profile and nonspecific immune parameters, and down-regulated the expression level of (IL-1β and TNF-α).",

However, their development is challenged by the limited expansion and differentiation of the cells ex vivo. Here we induced the endogenous expansion and activation of γδ T cells through oral administration of garlic-derived nanoparticles (GNPs). We found that GNPs could significantly promote the proliferation and activation of endogenous γδ T cells in the intestine, leading to generation of large amount of interferon-γ (IFNγ). Moreover GNP-treated mice showed increased levels of chemokine CXCR3 in intestinal γδ T cells, which can drive their migration from the gut to the tumour environment. The translocation of γδ T cells and IFNγ from the intestine to extraintestinal subcutaneous tumours remodels the tumour immune microenvironment and synergizes with anti-PD-L1, inducing robust antitumour immunity. Our study delineates mechanistic insight into the complex gut-tumour interactome and provides an alternative approach for γδ T cell-based immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Employing network pharmacology and molecular docking, the study predicts the active compounds in garlic and elucidates their mechanism in inhibiting the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). ALD is a global chronic liver disease with potential for hepatocellular carcinoma progression. METHODS: The main active ingredients and targets of garlic were identified through screening the TCMSP, TCM-ID, and ETCM databases. ALD disease targets were sourced from DisGeNET, GeneCards, and DiGSeE databases, and intervention targets for garlic were determined through intersections. Protein interaction networks were constructed using the STRING platform, and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed with R software. The garlic component-disease-target network was established using Cytoscape software. Validation of active ingredients against core targets was conducted through molecular docking simulations using AutoDock Vina software. Expression validation of core targets was carried out using human sequencing data of ALD obtained from the GEO database. RESULTS: Integration of garlic drug targets with ALD disease targets identified 83 target genes. Validation through an alcohol-induced ALD mouse model supported certain network pharmacology findings, suggesting that garlic may impede disease progression by mitigating the inflammatory response and promoting ethanol metabolism. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the potential therapeutic mechanisms of garlic in inhibiting ALD development. The identified active ingredients offer promising avenues for further investigation and development of treatments for ALD, emphasizing the importance of botanical remedies in liver disease management."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Hypertension, substantially heightens the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of freeze-dried garlic extract in blood pressure and lipid profiles in prehypertensive individuals. METHODS: Participants (age of 30-70 years) were allocated to intervention (n=47) or control (n=49) groups. The intervention group received two capsules of freeze-dried garlic extract daily for eight weeks, while the control group received identical placebo capsules. Primary outcomes, SBP, DBP, PP, MAP, TC, TG, LDL and HDL levels, serum NO levels, were assessed at baseline, four weeks, and eight weeks. RESULTS: At the end of study, results showed significant changes in the values of SBP, DBP, and MAP except for PP. In comparison to those who received the placebo, a significant drop in SBP, DBP (p<0.001), and MAP (p<0.001) was observed in the intervention group. Also, there were significant changes in TG, LDL, TC, and HDL levels in the interventional group. A noticeable decline was reported in TG (p<0.001), LDL (p<0.001), and TC (p<0.001), while HDL levels increased (p<0.001) in the intervention group compared to those receiving the placebo. Following garlic supplementation, a significant increase in blood NO levels was reported in the intervention group (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that garlic supplementation was effective in lowering blood pressure, improving lipid profile, and increasing nitric oxide levels in prehypertensive participants. These results indicate that garlic could be a valuable complementary therapy for managing prehypertension.",

      "abstract": "With global warming, heat stress has become an important factor that seriously affects crop yield and quality. Therefore, understanding plant responses to heat stress is important for agricultural practice, but the molecular mechanism of high-temperature tolerance in garlic remains unclear. In this study, 'Xusuan No. 6' was used as the experimental material. After heat stress for 0 (CK), 2 and 24 h, transcriptome sequencing was used to screen metabolic pathways and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) closely related to heat stress and was further verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 86,110 unigenes obtained from the raw transcriptome sequencing data were spliced. After 2 h of heat treatment, the expression levels of 8898 genes increased, and 3829 genes were decreased in leaves. After 24 h, the expression levels of 7167 genes were upregulated, and 3176 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in seven categories: cellular processes, metabolic processes, binging, catalytic activity, cellular anatomical entity and protein-containing complex response to stimulus. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment showed that DEGs are involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and photosynthetic antenna proteins. Six genes were selected and further verified by qRT-PCR. In this study, the full-length transcriptome of garlic was constructed, and the regulatory genes related to the heat resistance of garlic were studied. Taken together, these findings can provide a theoretical basis for the cloning of heat resistance genes in garlic and for the analysis of heat resistance mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a morbid condition characterized by relapsing-remitting inflammation of the colon, accompanied by persistent gut dysmotility and abdominal pain. Different reports demonstrated biological activities of aged black garlic (ABG), including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We aimed to investigate beneficial effects exerted by ABGE on colon inflammation by using ex vivo and in vivo experimental models. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of an ABG water extract (ABGE) on rat colon specimens exposed to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known ex vivo experimental model of ulcerative colitis. We determined gene expression of various biomarkers involved in inflammation, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Moreover, we studied the acute effects of ABGE on visceral pain associated with colitis induced by 2,4-di-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) injection in rats. ABGE suppressed LPS-induced gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, NF-kB, and TNF-α. In addition, the acute administration of ABGE (0.03-1 g kg-1) dose-dependently relieved post-inflammatory visceral pain, with the higher dose (1 g kg-1) able to significantly reduce both the behavioral nociceptive response and the entity of abdominal contraction (assessed by electromyography) in response to colorectal distension after the acute administration in DNBS-treated rats. Present findings showed that ABGE could represent a potential strategy for treatment of colitis-associated inflammatory process and visceral pain. The beneficial effects induced by the extract could be related to the pattern of polyphenolic composition, with particular regard to gallic acid and catechin.",

It contains several bioactive compounds and offers a wide range of health benefits to humans, including those pertaining to nutrition, physiology, and medicine. Therefore, garlic is considered as one of the most effective disease-preventive diets. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have reported the sulfur-containing compounds, allicin and ajoene, for their effective anticancer, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, immune-boosting, and cardioprotective properties. As a rich natural source of bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, saponins, tannins, linalool, geraniol, phellandrene, β-phellandrene, ajoene, alliin, S-allyl-mercapto cysteine, and β-phellandrene, garlic has many therapeutic applications and may play a role in drug development against various human diseases. In the current review, garlic and its major bioactive components along with their biological function and mechanisms of action for their role in disease prevention and therapy are discussed.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of garlic on blood lipid levels and glucose levels in humans through a systematic review and meta-analysis. (2) Methods: We extensively searched four databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, up to February 2024. To assess the collective impact of garlic and its supplements on fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), an analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed when I2 < 50%. (3) Result: We found that the garlic intervention was effective in controlling FBG (mean difference = -7.01; 95% CI: -8.53, -5.49, p < 0.001), HbA1c (mean deviation = -0.66; 95% CI: -0.76, -0.55, p < 0.001, I2 = 62.9%), TC (mean difference = -14.17; 95% CI: -19.31, -9.03, p < 0.001), and LDL-C (mean difference = -8.20; 95% CI: -15.58, -0.81, p = 0.03); moreover, it also increased the level of HDL-C in humans (mean difference = 2.06; 95% CI: 1.54, 2.59; p < 0.001).

Intrinsic heterogeneity especially characterizes breast tumors with a triple negative phenotype, often leading to the failure of even the most advanced therapeutic strategies. To improve breast cancer treatment, the use of natural agents to integrate conventional therapies is the subject of ever-increasing attention. In this context, garlic (Allium sativum) shows anti-cancerous potential, interfering with the proliferation, motility, and malignant progression of both non-invasive and invasive breast tumor cells. As heterogeneity could be at the basis of variable effects, the main objective of our study was to evaluate the anti-tumoral activity of a garlic extract in breast cancer cells with a triple negative phenotype. Established triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were used, revealing subtype-dependent effects on morphology, cell cycle, and invasive potential, correlated with the peculiar down-modulation of Akt signaling, a crucial regulator in solid tumors. Our results first demonstrate that the effects of garlic on TNBC breast cancer are not unique and suggest that only more precise knowledge of the mechanisms activated by this natural compound in each tumor will allow for the inclusion of garlic in personalized therapeutic approaches to breast cancer.",

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the accumulative effects of continued garlic oral treatment on changes in the pancreas, bile duct, and liver with regards to: 1-Insulin mRNA transcription, synthesis, and concentration in relation to changes in serum insulin (SI); 2-Insulinogenic cells insulin intensity and distribution, proliferation, and morphology. METHOD: Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin concentration in serum and pancreas (PI) and sources and mRNA transcription in the pancreas, bile duct, and liver in normal rats given normal saline (NR-NS) and DR given either NS (DR-NS) or garlic extract (DR-GE) before and after 1, 4, and 8 weeks of oral treatment were examined. RESULTS: Compared to NR-NS, DR-NS showed a significant increase in FBG and reductions in SI and PI and deterioration in islets histology, associated pancreatic insulin numerical intensities, and mRNA transcription. However, compared to DR-NS, the targeted biochemical, histological, and genetic variables of DR-GE were significantly and incrementally improved as garlic treatment continued. Insulin or its indicators were not detected either in the bile duct or the liver in DR-GE. CONCLUSIONS: 8 weeks of garlic oral treatment is enough to incrementally restore only pancreatic islets of Langerhans insulin intensity and insulinogenic cells proliferation, morphology, and distribution. These indices were associated with enhanced pancreatic insulin mRNA transcription and synthesis. Eight weeks of garlic treatment were not enough to stimulate insulinogenesis in either the bile duct or the liver."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral insulin resistance and compromised insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells are significant factors and pathogenic hallmarks of diabetes mellitus (DM). NF-κβ/TLR-4 and SERCA/Ca2+ pathways have been identified as potential pathways regulating insulin synthesis by preserving pancreatic β-cell functioning. The current study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of aged garlic extract (AGE) against DM in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model with particular emphasis on pancreatic β-cell functioning. METHODS: AGE was characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate its physio-chemical characteristics followed by in-vitro anti-diabetic and antioxidant potential. This was followed by the induction of DM in laboratory animals for investigating the therapeutic action of AGE by evaluating the role of NF-κβ/TLR-4 and the SERCA/Ca2+ pathway. The parameters assessed in the present experimental setup encompassed antioxidant parameters, metabolic indicators, insulin concentration, intracellular calcium levels, apoptotic markers (CCK-8 and Caspase Glo-8), and protein expression (P-62 and APACHE-II). RESULTS: AGE characterization by SEM, GC-MS, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the presence of phenylalanine, alliin, S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), tryptophan, 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid as major bioactive constituents of AGE. Metabolic studies, including intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), revealed significantly lower blood glucose levels in the AGE group compared to the disease control group. In contrast, the intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ITT) exhibited no significant difference in insulin sensitivity between the AGE supplementation group and the DM control group. Interestingly, AGE was found to have no significant effect on fasting glucose and serum insulin levels. In contrast, AGE supplementation was found to cause significant hypoglycaemia in postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels. Importantly, AGE causes restoration of intracellular Ca2+ levels by modulation of SERCA/Ca2 functioning and inhibition NF-κB/TLR-4 pathway. AGE was found to interact with and inhibit the DR-5/ caspase-8/3 apoptotic complex. Furthermore, microscopic studies revealed degeneration and apoptotic changes in pancreatic β-cells of the DM control group, while supplementation of AGE resulted in inhibition of apoptotic pathway and regeneration of pancreatic β-cells. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that AGE enhance glucose homeostasis by exerting their effects on pancreatic β-cells, without ameliorating peripheral sensitivity. Moreover, AGEs promote an increase in β-cell mass by mitigating the apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells. These findings suggest that AGE could aid in developing a viable alternative therapy for diabetes mellitus (DM)."

The effect of single and combined foliar treatments of lettuce plants with sodium selenate and garlic bulb extract on seed yield and quality and on mature plant biochemical characteristics was investigated using four lettuce cultivars (Bouquet, Picnic, Moskovsky parnikovy and Cavalier). The seed production of plants treated with Se increased by 20-41%, compared to the untreated control plants, while the augmentation was as much as 10-23% and 17-27% under garlic extract and the joint application of Se and garlic, respectively. Garlic extract stimulated the accumulation of Se in lettuce seeds, which rose by 1.21-1.29 times compared to the Se-treated plants. The proline levels in lettuce seeds exceeded the corresponding values recorded in the control ones by 1.32-1.64 times in the case of the Se supply, 1.10-1.47 times upon garlic extract application and 1.09-1.31 times under the combined Se/garlic treatment. All the treatments given to lettuce plants increased the leaf weight by 1.10-1.30 times, compared to the untreated control. The seed Se levels positively correlated with the leaf weight (r = 0.621; p < 0.005), chlorophyll (r = 0.672, p < 0.002) and total antioxidant activity (AOA; r = 0.730, p < 0.001) of plants grown from these seeds. Positive correlations were also recorded between the seed proline content and lettuce plant leaf weight, chlorophyll and AOA (r = 0.868, 0.811 and 0.815, respectively, at p < 0.001). Lettuce yield was positively correlated with the leaf AOA, chlorophyll and ascorbic acid content (r = 0.942, 0.921 and 0.665, respectively, at p < 0.001). The results indicate high prospects of Na2SeO4 and garlic extract application to seed-addressed lettuce plants, to improve seed productivity and quality, as well as lettuce yield and quality."

Their application in agriculture brings alternatives for the controlled release of nutrients in the soil, the seed coating, the transport of herbicides, and the treatment of plant diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the use of fungicides incorporated into hybrid membranes formed by synthetic hectorite (LAPONITE®) and polymers in the pre-treatment of garlic bulbils exposed to the pathogen Stromatinia cepivora, which causes white rot. The coatings were selected by a germination test, based on the bulbil sprouting index, and by a mycelial growth inhibition test, based on the percentage of mycelial growth inhibition. The chosen membranes were used to coat the bulbils for bioassays conducted in a biochemical oxygen demand incubator at 17 °C. The coated bulbils were planted in soil samples containing three different densities of Stromatinia cepivora: 0.1 g, 1.0 g, and 10 g of sclerotium per L of soil. Membranes containing 2% carboxymethyl cellulose and 2% LAPONITE® incorporated with (i) the fungicide tebuconazole (36 mg L-1) and (ii) the combination of the actives tebuconazole (36 mg L-1) and triadimenol (62 mg L-1) showed the total rate of sprouting and null indices of incidence of symptoms and mortality in its repetitions. The hybrid membranes were characterized employing several techniques, including X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry coupled to mass spectrometry, and optical microscopy. Characterization data confirmed the presence of fungicides incorporated into the membranes. Some concentrations of fungicides were low enough not to be detected in all analyses performed, although they guaranteed a protective character to the bulbils about the fungus S. cepivora present in the soil, with a possibility of antifungal pre-treatment with a potential reduction in the concentration used.",

However, there is a paucity of studies investigating the impact of garlic oil on small intestinal motility. This study aimed to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of garlic oil on type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats. Thirty-six adult female Wistar rats (n = 36) were divided into four groups: control, non-diabetic rats supplemented with garlic oil, diabetic rats, and diabetic rats treated with garlic oil. The rats were anesthetized using pentobarbitone (40 mg/kg BW); various motility parameters and oxidative markers were determined in small intestinal segments. Measurements were taken for naso-anal length, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose level (FBG), and plasma insulin level. Compared to the control group, the diabetic rats exhibited a reduction in the average force of contraction and motility index in all small intestinal segments. Furthermore, the rats exhibited a reduction in the average duration of muscle contraction only in the jejunum. The rats also exhibited hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, significant oxidative stress, and obesity. This was proven by changes in motility parameters, fasting blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR values, intestinal MDA levels, and waist circumference. The non-diabetic rats supplemented with garlic oil also exhibited a decrease in the average force of contraction and motility index in all small intestinal segments, despite having consistently higher Lee index and waist circumference values. However, the diabetic rats treated with garlic oil demonstrated improved small intestinal motility in nearly all small intestinal segments and a reduction in oxidative stress. In conclusion, rats with diabetes mellitus experienced a decrease in small intestinal motility, which is primarily driven by oxidative stress. Normal rats administered with garlic oil supplements exhibited similar effects. In contrast, garlic oil treatment in diabetic rats led to enhanced small intestinal motility and a notable anti-hyperglycemic effect, which can be attributed to the potent antioxidant properties of garlic oil.",

In this study, enzymatic treatment of garlic resulted in an increase of approximately 50 % in the yield of essential oil, a feasible GC-MS analytical program for garlic oil was provided. Vacuum fractionation of the volatile oil and determination of its inhibitory activity against 10 fungi demonstrated that garlic oil has good antifungal activity. The antifungal activity levels were ranked as diallyl trisulfide (S-3)>diallyl disulfide (S-2)>diallyl monosulfide (S-1), with an EC50 value of S-3 against Botrytis cinerea reached 8.16 mg/L. Following the structural modification of compound S-3, a series of derivatives, including compounds S-4~7, were synthesized and screened for their antifungal activity. The findings unequivocally demonstrated that the compound dimethyl trisulfide (S-4) exhibited exceptional antifungal activity. The EC50 of S-4 against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum reached 6.83 mg/L. SEM, In vivo experiments, and changes in mycelial nucleic acids, soluble proteins and soluble sugar leakage further confirmed its antifungal activity. The study indicated that the trisulfide bond structure was the key to good antifungal activity, which can be developed into a new type of green plant-derived fungicide for plant protection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes Mellitus is associated with disturbances in male reproductive function and fertility. Studies have shown that oxidative stress with the subsequent inflammation and apoptosis cause these complications in diabetes. Garlic (G) (Allium sativum L) and Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad (C) both have antidiabetic and antioxidant properties. Recently, we demonstrated their synergistic effects in alleviating reproductive complications when administered concomitantly. However, as even medicinal plants in long term usage may lead to some unwanted side effects of their own, we examined whether with half the original doses of these two medicinal plants we could achieve the desired results. METHODS: Thirty-five male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n = 7/group): Control, Diabetic, Diabetic + G (0.5 ml/100 g BW), Diabetic + C (5 mg/kg BW) and Diabetic + GC (0.5 ml/100 g BW of garlic and 5 mg/kg BW of C. colocynthis) groups. The experimental period was 30 days. RESULTS: Oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), immunoexpression of caspase-3, and expression of mRNAs for receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX-4) and nuclear factor kappa B increased in testis of diabetic rats. Treatment with garlic and C. colocynthis alone showed some beneficial effects, but in the combination form the effectiveness was more profound. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the combination therapy of diabetic rats with lower doses is still as efficient as higher doses; therefore, the way forward for reducing complications in long term consumption.",

The impact of loading two concentrations (0.1 and 0.2 g per milliliter) of garlic extract on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria was examined. Results indicated a decrease in the growth range of S. aureus from 109 to 106 (CFU/ml) and E. coli from 1011 to 109 (CFU/ml) upon treatment. Additionally, cell adhesion and viability tests conducted on MG63 cells revealed an 8% increase in cell viability with the 0.1 g per milliliter concentration and a 35% decrease with the 0.2 g per milliliter concentration of garlic extract after 72 h of incubation (They have been evaluated by Microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay). GC-MS analysis identified the presence of diethyl phthalate compounds in the garlic extract, suggesting a potential correlation with cellular toxicity observed in the sample with the higher concentration (0.2 g per milliliter) of garlic extract. Overall, the TNTs loaded with 0.1 g per milliliter of garlic extract simultaneously demonstrated antibacterial activity, cell viability, adhesion, and growth enhancement."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. The construction of a competing gene network is an important step in the identification of the role of hub genes in breast cancers. In the current research, we used a number of bioinformatics tools to construct this network in breast cancer and investigated the combined effect of garlic and ginger on mice model of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We chose female mice weighing 18-20 g that were divided into 7 groups including; the cancer group receiving normal saline, different doses of ginger extract (100 and 500 mg/kg), different doses of garlic (50 and 100 mg/kg), tamoxifen (10 mg/ kg) and simultaneous garlic (100 mg/kg) and ginger (500 mg/kg) for 3 weeks intraperitoneal. Then we anesthetized the mice, isolated the tumor, and determined its size. Glutathione reductase and peroxidase levels and HER2, PTEN, and Cullin3 genes expression were measured. RESULTS: We identified 20 hub genes for breast cancer. In animal phase we found that tumor size in all mice receiving garlic and ginger showed a significant decrease compared to the control. Glutathione reductase showed a significant increase in all groups, especially in ginger 500 and combined groups. Glutathione peroxidase increased almost in all groups, especially in ginger 500. Expression of HER2 decreased in all treated groups. Expression of PTEN increased just in the combined group. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we introduce a number of novel promising diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer. The use of garlic and ginger in the treatment of cancer can be useful. This action is probably through the antioxidant mechanism, and regulation of the expression of cancer related genes such as PTEN.",

      "abstract": "Shortening the aging duration and enhancing the functional components of garlic present significant technical challenges that need to be addressed. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the potential role of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment, a novel nonthermal food processing method, in promoting and enhancing the functional attributes of aged garlic. Our results showed that 2-4 kV/cm PEF pretreatment increased S-allyl cysteine (SAC), total polyphenol (TPC), and flavonoid contents (TFC) compared with un-pretreated garlic during aging. The browning and texture-softening were also significantly improved during processing time, though the latter showed no significant difference from the eighth day to the end of the aging process. The principal component analysis results showed that PEF positively affects the SAC and TFC formations without adverse effects. Among the PEF pretreatments, 3 kV/cm is the most effective in enhancing functional component production compared with the other PEF pretreatments. Therefore, PEF pretreatment is a time-saving process that promotes and enhances the functionality of aged garlic."

This study aimed to investigate if topically applying N-benzyl-N-methyldecan-1-amine (BMDA), derived from garlic, and its derivative [decyl-(4-methoxy-benzyl)-methyl-1-amine] (DMMA) could effectively alleviate AD-like skin lesions in 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-treated mice. Administering these compounds to the irritated skin of DNCB-treated mice significantly reduced swelling, rash, and excoriation severity, alongside a corresponding decrease in inflamed epidermis and dermis. Moreover, they inhibited spleen and lymph node enlargement and showed fewer infiltrated mast cells in the epidermis and dermis through toluidine-blue staining. Additionally, they led to a lower IgE titer in mouse sera as determined by ELISA, compared to vehicle treatment. Analyzing skin tissue from the mice revealed decreased transcript levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), IL-4, iNOS, and COX-2, compared to control mice. Simultaneously, the compounds impeded the activation of inflammation-related signaling molecules such as JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB in the mouse skin. In summary, these findings suggest that BMDA and DMMA hold the potential to be developed as a novel treatment for healing inflammatory AD.",

      "abstract": "Atrazine is a widely applied herbicide to improve crop yield and maintain general health. It has been reported to impair thyroid function and architecture in experimental animals. Alterations in thyroid hormones disrupt normal body function and metabolism. Silymarin, a hepatoprotective flavonolignan, was found to improve thyroid function and body metabolism. Additionally, garlic displays several protective effects on body organs. Therefore, this study explored the prophylactic impact of natural compounds comprising silymarin and garlic extract on disrupted thyroid function, hepatic iodothyronine deiodinase type 1, and metabolic parameters in atrazine-intoxicated male rats. We found that daily pre- and co-treatment of atrazine-intoxicated male rats with silymarin (100 mg/kg, p.o) and/or garlic extract (10 mg/kg, p.o) significantly improved thyroid activation and hepatic functionality as evidenced by the re-establishment of T3, T3/T4, and TSH values as well as ALT and AST activities. Interestingly, individual or concurrent supplementation of the atrazine group with silymarin and garlic extract prevented the down-regulation in hepatic iodothyronine deiodinase type 1. These effects were coupled with the repletion of serum and hepatic antioxidants and the amelioration of lipid peroxidation. In addition, current natural products markedly alleviated weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Notably, a cocktail of silymarin and garlic extract exerted superior protection against atrazine-triggered deterioration of thyroid, hepatic, and metabolic functioning to individual treatments. Present findings pinpoint the prophylactic and synergistic influence of silymarin and garlic extract combinatorial regimen on thyroid activation and body metabolism via enhancing antioxidant potential, maintaining hepatic function, and iodothyronine deiodinase type 1.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Investigate the anti-cancerous potential of garlic-derived nanovesicles (GDNVs), exploring their cytotoxic effects on HeLa and PC-3 cell lines, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms, including apoptosis induction and inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). METHODS: GDNVs were isolated using differential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation. Characterization was performed through dynamic light scattering (DLS), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Cytotoxicity assessments on HeLa and PC-3 cell lines using MTT assay. Apoptosis induction was evaluated through nuclear morphology changes and quantification of apoptotic cells using DAPI and PI/annexin V analysis. Western blot of apoptosis-related proteins (bcl-2, bax, caspase-3) was analysed. Anti-metastatic potential was assessed using wound healing assay and EMT transition inhibition. RESULTS: Garlic-derived nanovesicles (GDNVs), characterized by a size of 134.2 nm, demonstrated a substantial and dose- as well as time-dependent anti-proliferative impact on HeLa and PC-3 cell lines. The induction of apoptosis was unequivocally established through discernible modifications in nuclear morphology. The apoptotic cell count in HeLa and PC-3 cells increased by 42.4 ± 4.2% and 38.2 ± 3.2%, respectively. Comprehensive Western blot demonstrated alterations in the expression of key apoptotic regulators, namely bcl-2, bax, and caspase-3, providing robust evidence for the initiation of apoptosis. Furthermore, GDNVs exerted a significant inhibitory effect (p < 0.001) on the migratory potential of both HeLa and PC-3 cells. Moreover, there was a discernible association between GDNVs and the suppression of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), emphasizing their role in impeding the metastatic potential of these cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: This study establishes, for the first time, the anti-cancerous potential of GDNVs. The observed dose- and time-dependent anti-proliferative effects, selective cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and anti-migratory potential highlight GDNVs as a promising candidate for cancer treatment.",

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is able to hide within host cells to evade immune clearance and antibiotics, leading to life-threatening infections. On-site detection and efficient treatment of intracellular S. aureus infection in wounds remain challenging. Herein, we report a thermosensitive, injectable, visible GELNs-based wound dressing, Van@GELNs/F127 hydrogel (gel Van@GELNs), which is H2O2-responsive and can slowly release vancomycin into host cells forS. aureus infection visualization and treatment in wounds. GELNs show inherent antibacterial activity, which is significantly enhanced after loading vancomycin. Both GELNs and Van@GELNs have the ability to be internalized by cells, so Van@GELNs are more effective than free vancomycin in killing S. aureus in RAW 264.7 macrophages. When applied to an S. aureus-infected wound on a mouse, the colorless HRP&ABTS/Van@GELNs/F127 solution immediately changes to a green hydrogel and shows better therapeutic effect than vancomycin. Thus, direct visualization by the naked eye and effective treatment of S. aureus infection in wounds are achieved by gel Van@GELNs. We anticipate gel Van@GELNs be applied for the theranostics of S. aureus infection diseases in the clinic in the near future.",

Although garlic has been used for thousands of years, black garlic is a relatively new discovery. There are many bioactive compounds in black garlic that give it medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. In our review article, we present scientific studies examining the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of black garlic. According to research, this effect is mainly due to the reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the ability to scavenge free oxygen radicals and induce apoptosis. In addition, the phytochemicals contained in it have antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties and inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Black garlic is a valuable source of biologically active substances that can support anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapy. Compared to Allium sativum, black garlic has fewer side effects and is easier to consume.",

Their addition to poultry feed has shown hazardous effects, including the development of antimicrobial resistance and a potentially harmful effect on human health. To eliminate these threats, there is increasing interest in natural alternatives. Plant derivatives such as garlic (Allium sativum L.) and its derivatives are presently extensively used in the poultry production system. The dietary supplementation of broilers and layers with garlic induced improvement in the production parameters, carcass quality, and intestinal integrity. The modulation of the immune response against some important viral diseases has resulted from the supplementation of poultry with garlic. Moreover, garlic has been shown to modulate gut health through antibacterial and antiparasitic activities. Treatment with garlic can also mitigate oxidative stress and reduce free-radical production. The reduction of cholesterol levels and improvement of some liver and blood parameters were also reported following the dietary inoculation of garlic. This review was designed to investigate the influence of garlic as a dietary additive on the performance, immunity, gut health, anti-oxidant status, blood parameters, and intestinal microbiota of poultry."

Our lab has previously reported that diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a garlic organosulfur compound (OSC) with chemopreventive and cell cycle arrest properties, reduces lipid peroxides and DNA damage in normal breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cells. In this study, we evaluated the ability of DATS to block the B[a]P-induced initiation of carcinogenesis in MCF-10A cells by examining changes in proliferation, clonogenic formation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, and protein expression of ARNT/HIF-1β, CYP1A1, and DNA POLβ. The study results indicate that B[a]P increased proliferation, clonogenic formation, ROS formation, and 8-OHdG levels, as well as increasing the protein expression of ARNT/HIF-1β and CYP1A1 compared to the control. Conversely, DATS/B[a]P co-treatment (CoTx) inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenic formation, ROS formation, and 8-OHdG levels compared to B[a]P alone. Treatment with DATS significantly inhibited (p < 0.0001) AhR expression, implicated in the development and progression of breast cancer. The CoTx also attenuated all the above-mentioned B[a]P-induced changes in protein expression. At the same time, it increased DNA POLβ protein expression, which indicates increased DNA repair, thus causing a chemopreventive effect. These results provide evidence for the chemopreventive effects of DATS in breast cancer prevention.",

This study demonstrates, for the first time, that DATS prevents premalignant breast cells from undergoing B[a]P-induced neoplastic transformation, thus providing more evidence for its chemopreventive effects in breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Gut microbiota function has numerous effects on humans and the diet humans consume has emerged as a pivotal determinant of gut microbiota function. Here, a new concept that gut microbiota can be trained by diet-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) to release healthy outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) is introduced. Specifically, OMVs released from garlic ELN (GaELNs) trained human gut Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) can reverse high-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in mice. Oral administration of OMVs released from GaELNs trained A. muciniphila can traffick to the brain where they are taken up by microglial cells, resulting in inhibition of high-fat diet-induced brain inflammation. GaELNs treatment increases the levels of OMV Amuc-1100, P9, and phosphatidylcholines. Increasing the levels of Amuc-1100 and P9 leads to increasing the GLP-1 plasma level. Increasing the levels of phosphatidylcholines is required for inhibition of cGas and STING-mediated inflammation and GLP-1R crosstalk with the insulin pathway that leads to increasing expression of Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS1 and IRS2) on OMV targeted cells. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism whereby OMVs from plant nanoparticle-trained gut bacteria regulate genes expressed in the brain, and have implications for the treatment of brain dysfunction caused by a metabolic syndrome.",

We conduct a meta-analysis to explore the influence of garlic supplementation versus placebo on the treatment of chronic liver disease. METHODS: We have searched PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases through September 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of garlic supplementation versus placebo for chronic liver disease. This meta-analysis is performed using the random-effect model. RESULTS: Four RCTs and 212 patients are included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with control group for chronic liver disease, garlic supplementation is associated with significantly reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and weight, but demonstrates no substantial impact on the incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Garlic supplementation is effective to treat chronic liver disease.",

      "abstract": "Plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) have drawn considerable attention for oral treatment of colonic diseases. However, the roles of ELNs derived from garlic on colitis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that garlic ELNs (GELNs), with desirable particle sizes (79.60 nm) and trafficking large amounts of functional proteins and microRNAs, stably roam in the gut and confer protection against ulcerative colitis (UC). In mice with DSS-induced colitis, orally administered GELNs effectively ameliorated bloody diarrhea, normalized the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and prevented colonic barrier impairment. Mechanistically, GELNs were taken up by gut microbes and reshaped DSS-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, in which Bacteroides was the dominant respondent genus upon GELNs treatment. Notably, GELNs-enriched peu-MIR2916-p3 specifically promoted the growth of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an intestinal symbiotic bacterium with palliative effects on colitis. Our findings provide new insights into the medicinal application of GELNs and highlight their potential as natural nanotherapeutic agents for preventing and treating UC.",

We studied the impact of the bioactive components degradation of oregano essential oil (OEO) and purple garlic powder (PGP) during storage in silos, their effect on the morphometry of the jejunum and ileum and the cecal microbiota as intestinal health indicators in piglets during the post-weaning period. We also monitored antimicrobial resistance in the commensal indicator E. coli. Histological parameters and intestinal microbiota were measured in 140 piglets weaned at 21 days of age. Seven dietary treatments were used: a negative control group (basal diet), a positive control group with ZnO (3000 mg/kg of food), two groups with OEO at 0.4% and 1.2%, respectively, two groups with PGP 0.4% and 2%, respectively, and a group with OEO with 1.2% combined with PGP with 2%. Each group of piglets received the treatment for seven weeks, from weaning, before samples were taken. Antibiotic resistance profiles were measured in 81 E. coli strains. On this occasion, only the control groups, ZnO, OEO 1.2%, PGP 2% and OEO 1.2% + PGP 2% were used, and the samples were obtained from the cecal content. A progressive loss of the bioactive components of OEO and PGP was observed during the 34 days of storage (p < 0.05). PGP 2%, OEO 1.2% and their combination showed results similar to ZnO (p > 0.05), or superior in the study of intestinal morphometry and the values of E. coli and Lactobacillus. All categories showed high levels of resistance. Only the strains isolated from the OEO 1.2% group did not show resistance to colistin and presented the lowest resistance values. In general, high doses of the additives studied showed the best results, obtaining levels like or higher than those offered by ZnO."

      "abstract": "Cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that poses a serious threat to human health worldwide. Despite significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the prognosis and survival rate of cancer remain poor due to late diagnosis, drug resistance, and adverse reactions. Therefore, it is very necessary to study the development mechanism of cancer and formulate effective therapeutic interventions. As widely available bioactive substances, natural products have shown obvious anticancer potential, especially by targeting abnormal epigenetic changes. The main active part of garlic is organic sulfur compounds, of which diallyl trisulfide (DATS) content is the highest, accounting for more than 40% of the total composition. The garlic-derived compounds have been recognized as an antioxidant for cancer prevention and treatment. However, the molecular mechanism of the antitumor effect of garlic-derived compounds remains unclear. Recent studies have identified garlic-derived compound DATS that plays critical roles in enhancing CpG demethylation or promoting histone acetylation as an epigenetic inhibitor. Here, we review the therapeutic progress of garlic-derived compounds against cancer through epigenetic pathways.",
