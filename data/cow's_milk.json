      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although breast milk is ideal for newborns, in some cases, it is replaced with cow's milk, which contains proteins that increase the risk of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). AIM: To evaluate CMPA prevalence in Bahrain and compare clinical characteristics of children with immunoglobulin E (IgE)- and non-IgE-mediated CMPA. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined children with CMPA diagnosed at the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic of the Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain, between 2014 and 2022, and assessed CMPA prevalence. Clinical presentations, laboratory findings, dietary modifications, and outcomes were compared between children with IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated CMPA. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test or Pearson's χ 2 test, whereas continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Of 8332 patients, 6022 (72.3%) adhered to their appointment. Of them, 618 (10.3%) were suggested of having CMPA and 595 (96.3%) were included; CMPA prevalence was 2%. Most patients were Bahraini (93.8%) and males (55.3%). Non-IgE-mediated type accounted for 77.3% cases and IgE-mediated type, 22.7%. IgE-mediated CMPA presented more in boys (P = 0.030), and later in life (5.1 months ± 4.5 months vs 4.2 months ± 4.2 months, P = 0.016, 95%CI: 0.08-1.73), had more associated diseases (P < 0.001); and presented with more cutaneous (P = 0.024) and respiratory (P = 0.003) manifestations, severe symptoms [rash/dry skin (P = 0.031), facial swelling/angioedema (P = 0.003), failure to thrive (P = 0.013), apparent life-threatening event (P < 0.001)], and positive physical findings (P = 0.002) than non-IgE-mediated CMPA. Most patients were exclusively fed cow milk formula (50.3%). The amino acid-based formula (AAF) was most prescribed (60.5%) with no difference between the two types (P = 0.173). Although breastfeeding was recommended to 49.6%, only 8.2% were exclusively breastfed. IgE-mediated CMPA was associated with a longer follow-up duration than non-IgE-mediated CMPA (17.3 months ± 14.0 months vs 13.5 months ± 13.4 months, P = 0.005, 95%CI: 1.1-6.3). CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high CMPA prevalence with clinical differences between both types that can influence treatment. AAF was most prescribed, while breastfeeding with dietary modification is rarely applied."

      "abstract": "The European Commission (EC) requested the European Food Safety Authority to evaluate the nutritional safety and suitability of a specific protein hydrolysate derived from sources of skimmed cow's milk (including non-fat) and whey protein concentrates for use in infant and follow-on formula manufactured by Healthcare Reckitt B.V. Healthcare Reckitt B.V. submitted a dossier to the EC seeking an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2016/127 regarding the protein sources permissible in the manufacture of infant and/or follow-on formula. The protein hydrolysate under evaluation is sufficiently characterised with respect to the hydrolysed protein. In the pertinent intervention study provided, an infant formula manufactured from the protein hydrolysate with a protein content of 2.3 g/100 kcal and consumed as the sole source of nutrition for 3 months led to growth that is similar to an infant formula manufactured from intact cow's milk protein with a protein content of 1.9 g/100 kcal. Data on adverse events and tolerance of the formula did not raise any concerns. No experimental data have been provided on the nutritional safety and suitability of this protein source in follow-on formula. Given that follow-on formula is consumed with complementary foods and the protein source is nutritionally safe and suitable in an infant formula that can be the sole source of nutrition of young infants, the Panel considers that the protein hydrolysate is also a nutritionally safe and suitable protein source for use in follow-on formula. The Panel concludes that the protein hydrolysate under evaluation is a nutritionally safe and suitable protein source for use in infant and follow-on formula, as long as the formula in which it is used contains a minimum of 2.3 g/100 kcal protein and complies with the compositional criteria of Regulation (EU) 2016/127 and the amino acid pattern in its Annex IIIA."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is a common food allergy in infants. Guidelines and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of CMA are based on scientific review of the available evidence. However, real-world situations may oblige clinicians to adapt a different attitude. METHODS: This paper evaluated the opinion of 42 Mexican paediatricians on the 73 statements presented in the recent position paper of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). Voting on the statements and their interpretation were identical for both groups (online and anonymous). Both groups were unaware of the other's outcome at the moment of the voting. RESULTS: While the ESPGHAN group accepted all 73 statements, the Mexican group rejected 19 statements. Two rejections were due to the mean and median being below the predefined and agreed-upon cut-off, and 17 were due to over 75% of participants disagreeing with the statements. The greatest discrepancy was observed regarding the role of vitamin D in preventing CMA. CONCLUSION: While opinions on the prevalence, diagnosis and management of CMA were comparable between European paediatric gastroenterologists and Mexican general paediatricians for the majority of statements, significant differences were observed. It is essential to gather information from various regions and healthcare levels to enhance the impact of recommendations."

The breakdown of A1-β-casein produces β-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), a peptide with opioid-like properties that is associated with health aspects. In addition, A1- and A2-β-casein have different technological properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cheese produced from the milk of homozygous A1A1 and A2A2 cows varies in terms of its physicochemical parameters and BCM-7 concentration. These parameters were analyzed during initial cheese processing, six weeks of ripening and 84 days of storage, including additional microbiological analyses during the storage period. The pH values of the A1A1 cheeses were higher than those of the A2A2 cheeses from the beginning of production until the starter culture bacteria were added. The yellowness values of the A1A1 cheeses were lower until the salt bath treatment. Water activity, lightness, hardness, fat, protein, NaCl and dry matter content, as well as color and microbiological parameters, were not affected by the β-casein genotype. BCM-7 concentrations were higher in the A1A1 cheeses after pressing and during ripening. We found mainly comparable quality characteristics and slightly different BCM-7 levels in the A1A1 and A2A2 cheeses. From this point of view, both varieties are equally suitable for cheese production."

Current palliative measures, such as specialized formula milk, offer temporary relief but are costly and fail to address the underlying issue. Thus, there is a critical need to better understand CMPA and explore new treatment options. METHODS: This study employed bibliometric methods to analyze global pediatric CMPA research and identify future directions for the first time. Visual analyses were conducted using VOS Viewer and CiteSpace software. RESULTS: A total of 2040 articles published between 2000 and 2023 showed increasing annual publications. In this field of research, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has made significant contributions, with the most influential articles published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Current research emphasizes personalized therapy, probiotics, and gut microbiota in CMPA. CONCLUSION: Future research will focus on microbiota-related personalized treatments, promising effective clinical interventions."

      "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic, antigen-driven, immune-mediated disease characterized by esophageal dysfunction and significant eosinophilic infiltration. Its rising incidence and prevalence over recent decades reflect both increased clinical awareness and the influence of environmental factors such as dietary patterns and allergen exposure. Among food allergens, cow's milk proteins are the most commonly implicated triggers, contributing to esophageal inflammation through complex immunological pathways involving both IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. Dietary elimination of cow's milk has been shown to induce histologic remission in over 60% of pediatric patients, underscoring its pivotal role in eosinophilic esophagitis management. Despite these promising results, challenges persist, including variability in individual responses, the burden of adherence to restrictive diets, and gaps in understanding the molecular mechanisms driving cow's milk-induced esophageal inflammation. This review examines the complex relationship between eosinophilic esophagitis and cow's milk, focusing on its role in disease pathogenesis and management, offering insights into its therapeutic implications. Understanding the interplay between eosinophilic esophagitis and dietary allergens, particularly cow's milk, may inform the development of targeted interventions and improve clinical outcomes for affected patients.",

Through an anonymous retrospective online questionnaire, we investigated parent perspectives regarding the therapy option of a CM and HE ladder in children with CM and/or HE allergy. Of the 54 families contacted, 29 took part in the study. 19/29 children had already completed the ladders when the survey took place. 19/29 children showed an allergic reaction during the treatment of whom 17 presented skin rashes. 16/29 parents were anxious to rise to the next step in the protocol. 15/29 had difficulties with the implementation of the therapy due to the child refusing the offered food and organizational issues. Medical support as well as the ladder as a therapy option were scored satisfactory. The participating parents were satisfied with the therapy option and medical care. We identified two main areas for improvement: First, the suggested food for every step should be more diverse, according to the families' culture background and nutritional needs/demands. Second, to reduce anxiety regarding the therapy, parents must be informed that although allergic reactions are common, they remain mild. Furthermore, we will suggest step changes under medical supervision, especially in families with a slow progression of the food ladder. With these improvements, the duration of therapy could be shortened, thus reducing the risk of an allergic reaction, the need for medical care by an allergist and therefore reducing healthcare costs."

This work aimed to assess the effect of cow's milk (CM) tolerance acquisition and synbiotic (inulin, oligofructose, Bifidobacterium breve M-16 V) supplementation on the fecal metabolome in infants with IgE-mediated CMA. METHODS AND RESULTS: The CMA-allergic infants received AAF or AAF-S for a year during which fecal samples were collected. The samples were subjected to metabolomics analyses covering gut microbial metabolites including SCFAs, tryptophan metabolites, and bile acids (BAs). Longitudinal data analysis suggested amino acids, BAs, and branched SCFAs alterations in infants who outgrew CMA during the intervention. Synbiotic supplementation significantly modified the fecal metabolome after 6 months of intervention, including altered purine, BA, and unsaturated fatty acid levels, and increased metabolites of infant-type Bifidobacterium species: indolelactic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid. CONCLUSION: This study offers no clear conclusion on the impact of CM-tolerance acquisition on the fecal metabolome. However, our results show that 6 months of synbiotic supplementation successfully altered fecal metabolome and suggest induced bifidobacteria activity, which subsequently declined after 12 months of intervention.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess common gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy Brazilian infants receiving goat milk-based formula (GMF) compared to cow's milk-based formula (CMF). METHODS: We performed a 24-weeks double-blind, randomized, controlled study in Brazil, enrolling healthy infants from 3 to 12 months of age. Primary outcome were the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms stool consistency, regurgitation frequency and crying duration. Secondary outcomes were growth trajectories and hemoglobin levels. Repeated mixed models were used to compare outcomes variables between GMF and CMF groups, while adjusting for age at baseline. RESULTS: Fifty-six infants were recruited and randomly allocated in the GMF (n = 26) and the CMF (n = 30) group. Scores on all measured GI symptoms were low and similar among the groups throughout intervention period and improved over time. Average age- and sex-adjusted WHO z-scores of weight, length, head circumference, and weight-for-length were all within +/-1 SD and similar between groups, indicating adequate growth. Serum hemoglobin was 11.1 (SD 0.7) g/dL in infants fed GMF and 11.0 (SD 0.8) g/dL in infants fed CMF after the intervention and was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: GMF was well tolerated, safe and supported adequate growth in infants. This was shown by the low occurrence of GI symptoms, adequate blood hemoglobin levels and adequate growth within WHO standards. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of the Federal University of Bahia under number CAAE06923319.5.0000.5577. The study was retrospectively registered in clinicaltrials.gov on 02/05/2024 under identifier NCT06395571.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of whey obtained by either enzyme (sweet) or acid treatment on wound healing remains unclear. This study investigated the effectiveness of camel and bovine whey prepared enzymatically (CSW and BSW) or by pH reduction (CAW and BAW). After removing the cream from milk, HCl or rennet was used to remove casein, resulting in acid or sweet whey, respectively, followed by lactose removal using dialysis. Casein removal was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Wound-healing activity was measured in vitro on HT-29 cells by scratch assay. All four whey samples (0-1000 mg L-1) were applied on the cells, and the closure of the cell-free scratched areas was monitored for 48 h. RESULTS: All whey samples increased the cell migration significantly (P < 0.05) to help close the cell-free areas as an indication of wound healing compared to the negative control. However, the closure amounts between the highest dose (1000 mg L-1) and the control were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Acid whey samples significantly (P < 0.05) elevated the closure speed compared to the sweet whey samples. The highest closure percentage (64.69%) was achieved after treatment with 10 mg L-1 CAW for 48 h. Between the sweet whey samples, BSW was significantly (P < 0.05) more effective in closing the cell-free zone compared to CSW. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the wound-healing potential of camel and bovine whey in vitro by comparing their effects on HT-29 cell migration. CAW showed the greatest activity and may find uses as a treatment agent in wound healing. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The detailed profile of these Abs during OIT remains largely unclear. We developed a diagnostic tool to assess the OIT efficacy and extent of responsiveness based on a profiling method by identifying epitopes recognized by the Ab classes of IgE or IgG4. A peptide microarray followed by microplate analysis using synthetic peptides was used to identify 14 epitopes widely recognized by IgE and/or IgG4 in the serum samples of patients with OIT among the amino acid sequences of five major cow's milk allergens. The set of defined 14 epitopes clarified different epitope profiles of allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 in each patient's serum samples. Moreover, the total signal of Abs recognizing all 14 epitopes was equal to the sum of all individual epitope-specific Abs. It was further observed that the quantitative value of IgE concentrations of 14 epitopes-ALL correlated with the ImmunoCAP IgE value. These findings strongly imply that the quantity of IgE and IgG4 recognizing epitopes-ALL may easily be used to measure allergy severity. To investigate this potential, we developed an immunochromatographic method that can detect IgE and IgG4 levels in patient samples. This study clearly demonstrated the usefulness of the defined 14 epitopes and their mixture, \"epitopes-ALL,\" and that the simple and reliable methods of immunochromatography and microplate analyses demonstrating the epitope profile of allergen-specific Abs are applicable for diagnostic use at multiple disease stages and the OIT-treatment course in patients with cow's milk allergy.",

OBJECTIVE: To extend follow-up until the end of adolescence. METHODS: This is an extension study of 23 of 54 patients diagnosed with IgE-CMA from a population-based study of 13,019 newborns, who remained allergic at age 5 years. Patients were examined at age 17 years, and their history was reviewed. Resolution was determined by regular milk consumption without adverse reactions or a negative oral food challenge (OFC). Allergy was defined by a recent objective reaction to milk and a positive skin prick test (SPT), or by sensitization ≥95% positive predictive value (PPV) to milk. Risk factors for persistence at age 17 years were examined in the entire cohort. RESULTS: Of the 23 patients followed, 8 (35%) had spontaneous resolution and 15 had persistent IgE-CMA. Overall, 39 of the 54 patients (72.2%) initially diagnosed with IgE-CMA had spontaneous resolution by age 17 years. Risk factors for IgE-CMA persistence at age 17 years included SPT >6 mm at the time of diagnosis (P = .03), no cow's milk formula feeding in the nursery (P = .008), and wheezing on diagnostic OFC/initial reaction to milk (P = .04). Seven patients experienced objective reactions after age 5 years. These patients had more wheezing (P = .045) or anaphylaxis (P = .02) on diagnostic OFC/initial reaction and more current asthma (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Significant rate of spontaneous resolution of IgE-CMA still occurs beyond age 5 years, and few patients with IgE-CMA, mostly asthmatics, experience objective reactions by early adulthood. This should be considered in the treatment approach of patients with IgE-CMA.",

Treatment consists of avoiding cow's milk proteins in lactating mothers and/or using therapeutic formulas based on hydrolysates or vegetable formulas. In infants with CMPA at diagnosis, a different gut microbial profile has been found compared to healthy children, with a reduction in beneficial bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota profile and its metabolites, dietary patterns and anthropometric variables in a pediatric cohort with CMPA after six months on a restrictive diet compared to healthy controls. METHODS: In total, 21 patients diagnosed with CMPA and a control group of 24 healthy infants participated in this study. The fecal microbiota of all participants were investigated by metataxonomic analysis of 16S rDNA amplicons, and fecal short-chain fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Epidemiological assessment and dietary questionnaires were carried out for both groups. RESULTS: Regarding growth, no significant differences were found, but differences in dietary intake of some macro- and micronutrients were observed. Patients who were breastfed at six months had higher bifidobacteria and lipid intakes than patients fed with hydrolyzed formulas. CONCLUSIONS: Although the growth of CMPA infants fed with therapeutic formula is similar to breastfed CMPA infants, there are differences in microbiota composition and macronutrient intake that underline the importance of continued breastfeeding in CMPA cases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Milk is an important source of dietary calcium and, if fortified, vitamin D. Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is treated with a milk elimination diet. Although most children become tolerant by age 3 years, some continue dairy avoidance. It remains unclear whether adolescents with a history of CMA adopt similar milk consumption as their peers. We assessed dairy consumption and concentration of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in adolescents with either confirmed CMA or a negative CMA challenge in infancy (CMA-refuted group) and age-matched controls. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study is based on a previously reported randomized controlled trial from 1999 to 2002 on the treatment effect of probiotics on atopic eczema in participants aged <12 months (n = 230) with data on CMA status. We followed up these participants, aged 15-18 years, in 2017 (n = 104). A 20-item food frequency questionnaire assessed dairy consumption. An automated immunoassay measured 25(OH)D concentration. RESULTS: Median dairy product consumption did not differ between adolescents with CMA (449 g/d, n = 40), the CMA-refuted group (566 g/d, n = 36), and controls (235 g/d, n = 51) (P = 0.117). Median 25(OH)D concentrations were 76.0, 79.3, and 80.8 nmol/l, respectively (P = 0.844). Among participants, 93% were vitamin D sufficient (25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/l), with no differences between groups (P = 0.914). CONCLUSION: Among adolescents with a history of CMA during infancy, our study found no reintroduction failure of milk and no difference in vitamin D insufficiency rate compared with peers. Current management of CMA seems to adequately minimize later nutritional disadvantages associated with a cow's milk elimination diet.",

Special formulas for infants with CMPA include extensively hydrolyzed (EHFs) and amino acid-based (AAFs) formulas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth of infants fed with these special formulas. METHODS: This was a prospective chart review study that evaluated the growth criteria of infants with CMPA fed with EHFs or AAFs until one year of age. These infants were referred to the gastroenterology clinic of Bahrami Children's Hospital from April 2021 to April 2022. These infants were divided into two groups, the group fed with EHFs and AAFs. Then growth criteria were evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: Fifty-eight children were enrolled in the study, of which 51.7% were girls. Forty were consuming the EHFs formulas. The median time of both diagnosis and treatment was 60 days. The most common clinical manifestations were gastroesophageal reflux, dysentery, eczema, vomiting, and cough, respectively. The diagnosis of the disease in the AAFs group was significantly earlier than in the other group. The growth of children in both groups was completely proportional to their age and growth criteria at birth. Comparing the groups, all growth parameters were higher in the EHFs group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the growth criteria (weight, length, and head circumference) were suitable for each group and were in accordance with the WHO growth charts compared to the birth criteria. But in the group fed with EHFs, compared to AAFs, the growth rate was higher."

A baked milk ladder is a method of dietary advancement therapy in IgE-mediated CMPA in Ireland, while in Spain, avoidance of milk awaiting natural tolerance acquisition through an oral food challenge (OFC) is employed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of dietary advancement therapy using a milk ladder compared with complete avoidance of milk for managing IgE-mediated CMPA. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 371 pediatric patients from the population who have been treated for IgE-mediated CMPA between 2011 and 2020, with the milk ladder (Ireland) or complete avoidance followed by an OFC (Spain). The main outcome was the introduction of cow's milk. RESULTS: Milk ladder patients were 3.67 times more likely to succeed in comparison with milk avoidance (p < .001). Anaphylaxis during the treatment period occurred in 34 patients in the milk avoidance groups, while three patients in the milk ladder group experienced anaphylaxis due to accidental exposure to milk (p < .001). Failure to complete treatment was associated with a higher skin prick test in the milk avoidance group and a raised specific IgE in the milk ladder group. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that compares outcomes of dietary advancement therapy to complete avoidance for CMPA management, demonstrating that cow's milk can be successfully and safely reintroduced using dietary advancement therapy using a milk ladder.",

TIP has established efficacy toward peanut allergy. This form of treatment demonstrates equal efficacy toward cow's milk anaphylaxis. TIP maintains remission outcomes defined as a minimum of 7 days of allergen unresponsiveness to high-dose protein exposures. Furthermore, remission patients openly consume unrestricted amounts of dairy protein. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the rate of decline in specific IgE specific whole and component-resolved diagnostics following 1 year of TIP milk immunotherapy. METHODS: The study comprised 214 cow milk anaphylactic children who underwent TIP at the Translational Pulmonary & Immunology Research Center/Food Allergy Institute. Postintervention changes in cow milk specific IgE, component-resolved diagnostics, and specific IgG4 were assessed. RESULTS: After 1 year of 10-g dairy protein weekly sustained unresponsiveness, eosinophil count decreased from 558.38 to 409.26 cells/μL, the mean cow milk IgE decreased from 16.91 to 9.10 kU/L, the mean boiled cow milk IgE decreased from 12.89 to 6.03 kU/L, the mean Bos D4 decreased from 7.38 to 3.52 kU/L, the mean Bos D5 decreased from 6.79 to 3.16 kU/L, and the mean Bos D8 decreased from 13.55 to 6.62 kU/L. Adverse events were rare. CONCLUSIONS: TIP cow milk immunotherapy significantly reduced cow milk specific IgE and component-resolved diagnostics while increasing specific IgG4 in cow milk anaphylactic children. TIP demonstrates safety and clinical efficacy in cow milk anaphylaxis treatment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis and management of cow's milk allergy (CMA) is a topic of debate and controversy. Our aim was to compare the opinions of expert groups from the Middle East (n = 14) and the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) (n = 13). METHODS: These Expert groups voted on statements that were developed by the ESPGHAN group and published in a recent position paper. The voting outcome was compared. RESULTS: Overall, there was consensus amongst both groups of experts. Experts agreed that symptoms of crying, irritability and colic, as single manifestation, are not suggestive of CMA. They agreed that amino-acid based formula (AAF) should be reserved for severe cases (e.g., malnutrition and anaphylaxis) and that there is insufficient evidence to recommend a step-down approach. There was no unanimous consensus on the statement that a cow's milk based extensively hydrolysed formula (eHF) should be the first choice as a diagnostic elimination diet in mild/moderate cases. Although the statements regarding the role for hydrolysed rice formula as a diagnostic and therapeutic elimination diet were accepted, 3/27 disagreed. The votes regarding soy formula highlight the differences in opinion in the role of soy protein in CMA dietary treatment. Generally, soy-based formula is seldom available in the Middle-East region. All ESPGHAN experts agreed that there is insufficient evidence that the addition of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics increase the efficacy of elimination diets regarding CMA symptoms (despite other benefits such as decrease of infections and antibiotic intake), whereas 3/14 of the Middle East group thought there was sufficient evidence. DISCUSSION: Differences in voting are related to geographical, cultural and other conditions, such as cost and availability. This emphasizes the need to develop region-specific guidelines considering social and cultural conditions, and to perform further research in this area."

To achieve remission of symptoms and future tolerance, exclusion must be total. In formula fed infants the extensively hydrolysed formula is the most appropriate option in mild or moderate forms, while those based on amino acids are reserved for the most severe cases. The treatment time, the acquisition of tolerance and the moment for the oral provocation test will vary according to the clinical picture, the immunological mechanism involved and the age of the patient. The aim of this consensus has been to reflect the updated knowledge together with the experience of neonatologists, pediatricians, experts in allergy, nutrition and gastroenterology.",

      "abstract": "A 12-year-old girl with severe cow's milk allergy (CMA) was able to safely consume 300 mL of unhydrolyzed cow's milk after three and a half years of oral immunotherapy (OIT) with extensively hydrolyzed milk. The treatment consisted of gradually increasing the intake of hydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed milk and reintroducing cow's milk. Despite some allergic reactions during treatment, the patient was able to consume more than 200 ml of milk consistently for more than six months without recurrence of symptoms. This case suggests the possibility of an alternative treatment for persistent CMA: not only OIT with cow's milk alone but also a safer introduction to treatment with extensively hydrolyzed formulas."

      "abstract": "One of the most frequent triggers of food anaphylaxis in pediatric age but also among the most common, early, and complex causes of childhood food allergy is cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). The diagnostic course and management of this allergy is defined in a complex clinical picture due to several factors. First of all, the epidemiological data are not uniform, mainly as a consequence of the diagnostic methodology used in the various studies and the different age ranges covered. In addition, there is the complexity of terminology, since although CMPA traditionally refers to immune-mediated reactions to cow's milk, it is a term encompassing numerous clinical features with different symptoms and the requirement for specific treatments. Moreover, the differential diagnosis with other very frequent diseases, especially in the first year of life, such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease or colic, is still complex. This can result in misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment, with harmful health consequences and significant economic repercussions. In this context, the combination of several omics sciences together, which have already proved useful in clarifying the allergenicity of cow's milk proteins with greater precision, could improve the diagnostic tests currently in use through the identification of new, more specific, and precise biomarkers that make it possible to improve diagnostic accuracy and predict the patient's response to the various available treatments for the recovery of tolerance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most common food allergy in infants. The replacement with specialized formulas is an established clinical approach to ensure adequate growth and minimize the risk of severe allergic reactions when breastfeeding is not possible. Still, given the availability of multiple options, such as extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk protein formula (eHF-CM), amino acid formula (AAF), hydrolyzed rice formula (HRF) and soy formulas (SF), there is some uncertainty as to the most suitable choice with respect to health outcomes. Furthermore, the addition of probiotics to a formula has been proposed as a potential approach to maximize benefit. OBJECTIVE: These evidence-based guidelines from the World Allergy Organization (WAO) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about the use of milk specialized formulas, with and without probiotics, for individuals with CMA. METHODS: WAO formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to include the views of all stakeholders and to minimize potential biases from competing interests. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline-development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, which were subject to review by stakeholders. RESULTS: After reviewing the summarized evidence and thoroughly discussing the different management options, the WAO guideline panel suggests: a) using an extensively hydrolyzed (cow's milk) formula or a hydrolyzed rice formula as the first option for managing infants with immunoglobulin E (IgE) and non-IgE-mediated CMA who are not being breastfed. An amino-acid formula or a soy formula could be regarded as second and third options respectively; b) using either a formula without a probiotic or a casein-based extensively hydrolyzed formula containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for infants with either IgE or non-IgE-mediated CMA.The issued recommendations are labeled as \"conditional\" following the GRADE approach due to the very low certainty about the health effects based on the available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: If breastfeeding is not available, clinicians, patients, and their family members might want to discuss all the potential desirable and undesirable consequences of each formula in infants with CMA, integrating them with the patients' and caregivers' values and preferences, local availability, and cost, before deciding on a treatment option. We also suggest what research is needed to determine with greater certainty which formulas are likely to be the most beneficial, cost-effective, and equitable."

The overuse of antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of mastitis favours antimicrobial resistance and milk can be a potential route of dissemination. This study aimed to evaluate the biological quality of bulk tank milk (BTM) and the microbiological quality and signs of mastitis of freshly milked raw milk. In addition, to evaluate antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. isolated from freshly milked raw milk. None of the farms were within the official Brazilian biological quality limits for BTM. Freshly milked raw milk with signs of clinical (CMM), subclinical (SCMM) and no signs (MFM) of mastitis were detected in 6.67%, 27.62% and 65.71% samples, respectively. Most samples of freshly milked raw milk showed acceptable microbiological quality, when evaluating the indicators total coliforms (78.10%), Escherichia coli (88.57%) and Staphylococcus aureus (100%). Klebsiella oxytoca and S. aureus were the most prevalent microorganisms in SCMM and MFM samples. Antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistance (MDR) were observed in 65.12% and 13.95% of Enterobacteriaceae and 84.31% and 5.88% of Staphylococcus spp., respectively, isolated from both SCMM and MFM samples. Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporin (3GCR) (6.98%) and carbapenems (CRE) (6.98%) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (4.88%) were observed. Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can spread resistance genes to previously susceptible bacteria. This is a problem that affects animal, human and environmental health and should be evaluated within the one-health concept.",

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two tertiary care centers in Bogotá. Demographic, medical information, and QoL scores were collected by parental interview. We carried out a cost-of-illness analysis based on self-reported out-of-pocket expenses attributed to the treatment as a whole and the family's monthly income. Exploratory analyses used the QoL scores and the percentage of out-of-pocket expenses attributable to treatment as outcomes. RESULTS: 122 families were analyzed. Median subject age was 17 months (Q1-Q3: 11-26.75 months) and female subjects made up 71% of the sample. The median QoL score was 3.21 points (Q1-Q3: 2.43-4.34) and only differed by age groups and personal history of other food allergies. The median out-of-pocket treatment related costs was 300,000 Colombian pesos (COP) (Q1-Q3: 280,000-340,000 COP). About 17% of the families had to pay over 15% of their monthly income to purchase food and dietary products. Out-of-pocket treatment related costs differed depending on whether the treatment included formulas (Mann-Whitney test p < 0.001). Out-of-pocket treatment expenses were uncorrelated with the QoL scores. CONCLUSION: Food allergy related QoL scores were not associated with out-of-pocket expenses as a whole or as a fraction of monthly income but were higher in children with additional food allergies and in older age groups, suggesting a lower QoL.",

      "abstract": "Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most common and complex presentations of allergy in early childhood. CMA can present as IgE and non-IgE mediated forms of food allergy. Non-IgE mediated CMA includes food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs), and food protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIAP). There are recent guidelines addressing CMA diagnosis, management, and treatment. Each of these guidelines have their own strengths and limitations. To best manage CMA, individualized avoidance advice should be given. Cow's milk (CM) can be replaced in the diet by using hypoallergenic formulas or plant-based milk, depending on factors such as the child's age and their current food intake. Oral and epicutaneous immunotherapy is used to increase tolerance in children with CMA but is not without risk, and the long-term outcome of sustained unresponsiveness is still unclear. The allergenicity of CM proteins are affected differently by different forms of heating, leading to the use of baked milk or milk ladders in the management of CMA, most likely the most promising option for future management and treatment of CMA. Future management of children with CMA will also include discussion around the immunomodulatory potential of the child's dietary intake."

In this context, BALB/c mice were systemically sensitized with cow's milk proteins plus an aluminum adjuvant to induce CMA. The inhibitor GW4869 of exosome biogenesis was added before sensitization and then the anaphylactic reactions were evaluated both in vivo (clinical score and body temperature) and in vitro (serum histamine, allergen-specific antibodies, cytokines by ELISA and cell analysis by flow cytometry) to explore the role of exosomes in the development of CMA. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the size distribution and morphology of CMA-derived exosomes were not changed after GW4869 preconditioning, and the concentration of exosomes was much lower than that of the CMA group. In the GW4869 group, inhibition of release of exosomes modulated the induction of T helper 2 cell (Th2)-related substances, with a decrease in histamine and allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E, and the expression of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells all decreased as well. Moreover, the experimental data were integrated by means of principal component analysis (PCA) to give an overview that the percentage of Th cells and concentrations of cytokines were more influenced by GW4869 treatment. These data for the first time demonstrated that exosomes are involved in the development of CMA and the blockade of exosome release with GW4869 suppressed the IgE-mediated immune response in CMA.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: No approved treatment exists for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA), a common childhood food allergy. OBJECTIVE: To assess dose, efficacy, and safety of epicutaneous immunotherapy with Viaskin milk in children with IgE-mediated CMA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 1/2, 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical trial in children aged 2 to 17 years with IgE-mediated CMA was conducted between November 2014 through December 2017. It took place at 17 trial sites in the US and Canada. Current CMA was confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge at study entry. Part A assessed the short-term safety of 150 μg, 300 μg, or 500 μg of Viaskin milk; part B evaluated the efficacy and safety of the 3 doses vs placebo over 12 months of treatment. Of the 308 screened participants with physician-diagnosed CMA, 198 met eligibility criteria (including an eliciting dose 300 mg or less) and were randomized. INTERVENTION: Safety of Viaskin milk (150-μg, 300-μg, or 500-μg doses) was evaluated over a 3-week period (part A). In part B, 180 additional participants were randomized to receive Viaskin milk at doses of 150 μg, 300 μg, or 500 μg or placebo (1:1:1:1) for 12 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of treatment responders, defined as a 10-fold or more increase in the cumulative reactive dose of cow's milk protein (reaching at least 144 mg) or a cumulative reactive dose of cow's milk protein at 1444 mg or more at the month 12 double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. RESULTS: A total of 95.5% of the randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 8 [4.17] years; 124 of 198 were male [62.6%]) completed treatment. The highest response rate was observed in participants who received Viaskin milk at the 300-μg dose with 24 of 49 responders (49.0%) overall vs 16 of 53 responders (30.2%) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 0.91-5.41; P = .09), highest in the 2 to 11 years age group (22 of 38 [57.9%] vs 13 of 40 [32.5%]; P = .04). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate application-site reactions. One participant in the 500-μg Viaskin milk dose group experienced treatment-related anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, 12 months of daily epicutaneous immunotherapy with a dose of Viaskin milk at 300 μg was associated with a statistically significant treatment response in 2- to 11-year-old children with IgE-mediated CMA. Treatment-related anaphylaxis and treatment-related discontinuation rates were low. Further research is needed to explore Viaskin milk as a viable treatment option for children with IgE-mediated CMA.

      "abstract": "A previous guideline on cow's milk allergy (CMA) developed by the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) was published in 2012. This position paper provides an update on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CMA with focus on gastrointestinal manifestations. All systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding prevalence, pathophysiology, symptoms, and diagnosis of CMA published after the previous ESPGHAN document were considered. Medline was searched from inception until May 2022 for topics that were not covered in the previous document. After reaching consensus on the manuscript, statements were formulated and voted on each of them with a score between 0 and 9. A score of ≥6 was arbitrarily considered as agreement. Available evidence on the role of dietary practice in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of CMA was updated and recommendations formulated. CMA in exclusively breastfed infants exists, but is uncommon and suffers from over-diagnosis. CMA is also over-diagnosed in formula and mixed fed infants. Changes in stool characteristics, feeding aversion, or occasional spots of blood in stool are common and in general should not be considered as diagnostic of CMA, irrespective of preceding consumption of cow's milk. Over-diagnosis of CMA occurs much more frequently than under-diagnosis; both have potentially harmful consequences. Therefore, the necessity of a challenge test after a short diagnostic elimination diet of 2-4 weeks is recommended as the cornerstone of the diagnosis. This position paper contains sections on nutrition, growth, cost, and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) in childhood is a worldwide health concern. There is a growing awareness that the gut microbiome (GM) might play an important role in CMA development. Therefore, treatment with probiotics and prebiotics has gained popularity. This systematic review provides an overview of the alterations of the GM, metabolome, and immune response in CMA children and animal models, including post-treatment modifications. MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies on GM in CMA-diagnosed children, published before 1 March 2023. A total of 21 articles (13 on children and 8 on animal models) were included. The studies suggest that the GM, characterized by an enrichment of the Clostridia class and reductions in the Lactobacillales order and Bifidobacterium genus, is associated with CMA in early life. Additionally, reduced levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and altered amino acid metabolism were reported in CMA children. Commonly used probiotic strains belong to the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera. However, only Bifidobacterium levels were consistently upregulated after the intervention, while alterations of other bacteria taxa remain inconclusive. These interventions appear to contribute to the restoration of SCFAs and amino acid metabolism balance. Mouse models indicate that these interventions tend to restore the Th 2/Th 1 balance, increase the Treg response, and/or silence the overall pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine response. Overall, this systematic review highlights the need for multi-omics-related research in CMA children to gain a mechanistic understanding of this disease and to develop effective treatments and preventive strategies.",

      "abstract": "Cow's milk (CM) is a healthy food consumed worldwide by individuals of all ages. Unfortunately, \"lactase-deficient\" individuals cannot digest milk's main carbohydrate, lactose, depriving themselves of highly beneficial milk proteins like casein, lactoalbumin, and lactoglobulin due to lactose intolerance (LI), while other individuals develop allergies specifically against these proteins (CMPA). The management of these conditions differs, and an inappropriate diagnosis or treatment may have significant implications for the patients, especially if they are infants or very young children, resulting in unnecessary dietary restrictions or avoidable adverse reactions. Omics technologies play a pivotal role in elucidating the intricate interactions between nutrients and the human body, spanning from genetic factors to the microbiota profile and metabolites. This comprehensive approach enables the precise delineation and identification of distinct cohorts of individuals with specific dietary requirements, so that tailored nutrition strategies can be developed. This is what is called personalized nutrition or precision nutrition (PN), the area of nutrition that focuses on the effects of nutrients on the genome, proteome, and metabolome, promoting well-being and health, preventing diseases, reducing chronic disease incidence, and increasing life expectancy. Here, we report the opinion of the scientific community proposing to replace the \"one size fits all\" approach with tailor-made nutrition programs, designed by integrating nutrigenomic data together with clinical parameters and microbiota profiles, taking into account the individual lactose tolerance threshold and needs in terms of specific nutrients intake. This customized approach could help LI patients to improve their quality of life, overcoming depression or anxiety often resulting from the individual perception of this condition as different from a normal state.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (IgE-CMA) is one of the first allergies to arise in early childhood and may result from exposure to various milk allergens, of which β-lactoglobulin (BLG) and casein are the most important. Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind IgE-CMA is imperative for the discovery of novel biomarkers and the design of innovative treatment and prevention strategies. METHODS: We report a longitudinal in vivo murine model, in which two mice strains (BALB/c and C57Bl/6) were sensitized to BLG using either cholera toxin or an oil emulsion (n = 6 per group). After sensitization, mice were challenged orally, their clinical signs monitored, antibody (IgE and IgG1) and cytokine levels (IL-4 and IFN-γ) measured, and fecal samples subjected to metabolomics. The results of the murine models were further extrapolated to fecal microbiome-metabolome data from our population of IgE-CMA (n = 22) and healthy (n = 23) children (Trial: NCT04249973), on which polar metabolomics, lipidomics and 16S rRNA metasequencing were performed. In vitro gastrointestinal digestions and multi-omics corroborated the microbial origin of proposed metabolic changes. RESULTS: During mice sensitization, we observed multiple microbially derived metabolic alterations, most importantly bile acid, energy and tryptophan metabolites, that preceded allergic inflammation. We confirmed microbial dysbiosis, and its associated effect on metabolic alterations in our patient cohort, through in vitro digestions and multi-omics, which was accompanied by metabolic signatures of low-grade inflammation. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that gut dysbiosis precedes allergic inflammation and nurtures a chronic low-grade inflammation in children on elimination diets, opening important new opportunities for future prevention and treatment strategies.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study, led by a scientific committee of five experts in CMPA, was divided into six phases, including a modified Delphi process. A total of 20 panelists, all of whom were pediatric specialists, participated in administering a comprehensive 38-item questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into two blocks: Diagnosis and Treatment (20 items each). RESULTS: Consensus was reached on all the proposed items, with an agreement rate of over 70% for each of them. As a result, a diagnostic and treatment algorithm was developed that emphasized the reduction of unnecessary diagnostic studies and encouraged breastfeeding whenever possible. In cases where breast milk is not available, appropriate use of hypoallergenic formulas was recommended. In addition, recommendations on treatment duration and gradual reintroduction of cow's milk protein were provided. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations endorsed by 20 Mexican pediatricians through this study are applicable to everyday clinical practice, thereby enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of children under 2 years of age with CMPA. This, in turn, will foster improved health outcomes and optimize the utilization of healthcare resources.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of consumption of pasteurized cow's milk fortified with albumin protein in primary-school children, in Yasuj, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial with 12 weeks of duration, 60 children aged 7-13 years, mild to moderate underweight (-1≥ weight-for-age z-score ≥-3), were randomly assigned to control and albumin groups. The albumin group and the control group received 200 cc of milk with 10 g of albumin powder and 200 cc of milk with 10 g of cornstarch powder, respectively. At the beginning and end of the study, food intake and anthropometric indices were measured. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of intervention, none of the anthropometric indices (weight, weight-for-age z-score, body mass index (BMI), BMI-for-age z-score, and waist circumference) showed significant changes as compared to baseline in the control group, but weight-for-age z-score and BMI-for-age z-score showed significant increase as compared to baseline in the albumin group (before: -2.25 ± 0.40, after: -1.98 ± 0.35, P = 0.001 and before: -3.48 ± 0.86, after: -3.06 ± 0.71, P = 0.009, respectively). The comparison of the mean changes between the two groups showed significant difference regarding weight-for-age z-score (control group: -1.70 ± 0.31 in comparison with albumin group: -1.98 ± 0.35, P = 0.002), BMI (control group: 12.08 ± 1.96 in comparison with albumin group: 12.13 ± 1.49, P = 0.03), and BMI-for-age z-score (control group: -3.11 ± 0.91 in comparison with albumin group: -3.06 ± 0.71, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The consumption of albumin powder with milk can improve weight-for-age z-score and BMI-for-age z-score indices in children with mild-to-moderate underweight. Larger controlled interventional studies with longer duration are recommended."

      "abstract": "A broad range of allergic disorders and intolerance are associated with cow's milk protein in the infant diet. Allergy and intolerance to cow's milk proteins are commonly recognized in the healthy term infant, and the prevalence cow's milk protein intolerance (CMPI) varies widely but 5 challenge confirmed studies free from selection bias ranged from 1.9%-4.9%. These disorders are classified by the presence of IgE, non-IgE or T-cell-mediated signaling. Additionally, the severity of these adverse food reactions can range from mild gastrointestinal symptoms to severe sepsis-like episodes, as in the case of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). Food protein-induced intolerance in the healthy young infant lies in stark contrast to enterocolitis that typically occurs in the preterm neonate. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a distinct progressive disease process, usually characterized by a high mortality rate, with a risk of death from 30% to 50%. While its exact etiology is unclear, its main triggers include formula (cow's milk protein), hypoxia, perfusion-related issues, and unregulated inflammation in the premature intestine. The distinction between NEC and cow's milk protein intolerance is difficult to discern in some cases. In the late preterm population, infants with colitis can have both NEC and cow's milk intolerance on the differential. In infants with multiple episodes of mild NEC, cow's milk protein intolerance may be the underlying diagnosis. In this review, we compare the pathophysiological characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of disorders of cow's milk protein intolerance with the entity of preterm NEC. This review highlights similarities in both entities and may inspire future cross-disciplinary research."

      "abstract": "Cow's milk allergy is rare in exclusively breastfed infants. To support the continuation of breastfeeding an infant after diagnosis with a cow's milk allergy, it is critical to examine the evidence for and against any form of cow's milk elimination diet for lactating mothers. In this narrative review, we highlight the lack of high-quality evidence, hence subsequent controversy, regarding whether the minuscule quantities of cow's milk proteins detectable in human milk cause infant cow's milk allergy symptoms. Current clinical practice recommendations advise a 2-4 week trial of maternal cow's milk dietary elimination for: a) IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy only if the infant is symptomatic on breastfeeding alone; b) non-IgE-mediated associated symptoms only if the history and examination strongly suggest cow's milk allergy; and c) infants with moderate to severe eczema/atopic dermatitis, unresponsive to topical steroids and sensitized to cow's milk protein. There should be a clear plan for home reintroduction of cow's milk into the maternal diet for a period of 1 week to determine that the cow's milk elimination is responsible for resolution of symptoms, and then subsequent reoccurrence of infant symptoms upon maternal cow's milk reintroduction. The evidence base to support the use of maternal cow's milk avoidance for the treatment of a breastfed infant with cow's milk allergy is of limited strength due to a lack of high-quality, adequately powered, randomised controlled trials. It is important to consider the consequences of maternal cow's milk avoidance on reducing immune enhancing factors in breast milk, as well as the potential nutritional and quality of life impacts on the mother. Referral to a dietitian is advised for dietary education, along with calcium and vitamin D supplementation according to local recommendations, and a maternal substitute milk should be advised. However, for most breastfed infants with cow's milk allergy maternal cow's milk dietary elimination will not be required, and active support of the mother to continue breastfeeding is essential."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Spain, IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) affects approximately 0.69% of infants. Molecular diagnosis may be useful for monitoring natural spontaneous tolerance development in CMPA. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse a cohort of paediatric patients with IgE-mediated CMPA who were avoiding milk products awaiting natural tolerance and determine the relationship between disease persistence and major cow's milk allergens. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 200 patients diagnosed with IgE-mediated CMPA between 2011 and 2020 was conducted. Patients strictly avoided milk products until an oral food challenge was performed. The main outcome was the introduction of liquid milk following a negative oral food challenge and its correlation with IgE and SPT measurements of milk components at diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included the rate of allergic reactions and anaphylaxis during the treatment period and its correlation with IgE and SPT measurements. RESULTS: Of the 200 charts analysed, 122 patients had a negative oral food challenge to milk (61.0%) (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.1-67.5) following a period of strict avoidance of milk. Higher levels of component-specific IgE, especially casein, were associated with failure in the oral food challenge (p = 0.02). Allergic reactions were experienced by 106 children (53%), of which 34 (17%; 95% CI: 12.4-22.8) had anaphylactic reactions. The risk of anaphylaxis was not predicted by raised IgE levels. CONCLUSIONS: While a large proportion of children acquired natural tolerance to cow's milk following a period of strict avoidance, IgE-mediated CMPA persisted in many children. Casein IgE levels at diagnosis were raised in those who failed to achieve natural tolerance. Allergic reactions to milk, including anaphylaxis, occurred commonly, but this was not predicted by raised IgE levels or SPT measurements."

      "abstract": "The current study was designed to analyze nutritional parameters and to characterize carbapenemase producing-Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from bovine mastitic cow's milk. Out of 700 milk samples K. pneumoniae was identified by phenotypic and molecular techniques along with their antibiogram analysis and nutritional analysis was performed using the procedure of Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae was detected by phenotypic CarbaNP test followed by molecular characterization of their associated resistant genes blaVIM, blaKPC, blaOXA-48, blaNDM, and blaIMP along with insertion sequence common region 1 (ISCR1) and integrons (Int1, Int2, and Int3) genes. Among nutritional parameters, fat content was observed (2.99%) followed by protein (2.78%), lactose (4.32%), and total solid (11.34%), respectively. The prevalence of K. pneumoniae among bovine mastitis was found 25.71%. Antibiogram analysis revealed that more effective antibiotics was ceftazidime (80%) followed by amikacin (72%), while highly resistant antibiotics was Fusidic acid (100%). Distribution of carbapenemase producer K. pneumoniae was found 44.4%. Among carbapenem resistant genes blaKPC was found 11.25%, blaVIM 2.75%, blaNDM 17.5%, and blaOXA-48 7.5%, while blaIMP gene was not detected. Furthermore, distribution of ISCR1 was found 40%, while integron 1 was found 61.2% followed by integron 2 (20%), and integron 3 (5%). In conclusion, the recent scenario of carbapenemase resistant K. pneumoniae isolates responsible for mastitis may affect not only the current treatment regime but also possess a serious threat to public health due to its food borne transmission and zoonotic potential.",

      "abstract": "Cow's milk, which is one of today's most important food sources, can be a reservoir for many pathogens that create a risk to public health. One of these pathogens is Cryptosporidium parvum. The oocysts of C.parvum, an obligate intracellular parasite, cause infection when ingested orally. The oocysts scattered around with the feces of infected cows or calves can contaminate raw milk and this is frequently seen in dairy farms. The aim of this study was to investigate the viability of C.parvum by propidium monoazide (PMA)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method after heat treatment applied to contaminated raw cow's milk. For the study, 50 ml of unpasteurized cow's milk was contaminated with 5 X 105 C.parvum oocysts and portioned into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Three groups, namely the control group, pasteurization group and boiling group were formed. No warming procedure was applied to the control group. In the pasteurization group, the milks in microcentrifuge tubes were poured into the wells of the dry block heater set to 71.7 °C and incubated for five seconds. At the end of the period, the milks were transferred to the wells of the cold metal tube, which was removed at -20 °C with the help of a micropipette, and incubated for five seconds. The milks in the boiling group were incubated for two minutes in a dry block heater set to 95 °C. After the heat treatment, the milks in microcentrifuge tubes were transferred to 10 ml centrifuge tubes, PBS was added to make the final volume 10 ml, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes. After this process was repeated twice, 400 µl of PBS was added to the precipitate remaining at the bottom, and the precipitate was homogenized. One sample of each group was applied with PMA, while PMA was not applied to the other sample. PMA-applied samples were incubated for five minutes at room temperature and in the dark, and then exposed to UV light for five minutes in the device with cooling feature. The oocysts were collected by centrifugation at 5000 g for five minutes. After DNA isolation from oocysts, SYBR Green real time PCR (Rt-PCR) was performed using primers amplifying the COWP gene region. As a result of SYBR Green Rt-PCR, the mean Ct values of the control without PMA, pasteurization and boiling groups were determined as 25 ± 1.24, 23 ± 0.98 and 26 ± 1.03, respectively. While no peak was obtained in the boiling group after PMA application, the mean Ct values of the control and pasteurization groups were 28 ± 1.38 and 31 ± 1.46, respectively. As a result, it was concluded that live C.parvum cysts in milk could be detected by PMA-qPCR method and live oocysts could be found in pasteurized milk.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most frequent food allergy in early childhood. For those infants requiring breastmilk substitutes, formulas with extensively hydrolyzed proteins (EHF), should be the treatment of choice. As there are limited data showing the progression of initial symptoms in infants newly diagnosed with CMPA who are treated with EHF with added synbiotics, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the resolution of symptoms in said infants after 4 weeks of treatment. As a secondary objective this study aimed to assess the impact of the treatment on the family's quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: observational, longitudinal, prospective, and multicentric real-world evidence study. The intervention phase (EHF with synbiotics) lasted 28 days and was completed by 65 patients. Treating physicians registered child´s anthropometry, Infant Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (IGSQ-13) and CoMiSS (Cow´s Milk Allergy Symptoms Score) both at baseline and after 28 days of treatment. During treatment, caregivers reported child´s regurgitation and stools, PO-SCORAD (Patient Oriented Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) and FAQL-PB (Family Quality of Life-Parental Burden). Data were collected using Google Forms and analyzed through the STATA program. RESULTS: 95.4% of the patients showed an improvement or disappearance of the overall initial symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms improved or disappeared in 92% of patients (p < 0.05) while dermatological symptoms improved or disappeared in 87.5% of patients (p < 0.05). The median CoMiSS at baseline was 9, with 21 patients exceeding the cut-off point of 12. After 4 weeks of treatment, the median dropped to 3, and no patient exceeded the 12-cut-off point (p = 0.000). At baseline, patients had a PO-SCORAD of 11.5 (interquartile range 1-23) that went to 1.0 (interquartile range 1-6) at day 28 (p = 0.000). The treatment diminished stool frequency (p < 0.05), improved stool consistency (p = 0.004) and decreased the frequency of regurgitation in infants with CMPA (p = 0.01). The percentage of patients who no longer had any episode of regurgitation increased from 11% to 31% on day 28 (p = 0.003). At baseline, 13% of patients cried more than 3 h per day, while at day 28 that percentage dropped to 3% (p = 0.03). An improvement in the infants' sleep pattern was also appreciated with the treatment. At study onset, 56% of the families reported feeling very overwhelmed, a percentage that dropped to 17% after 28 days of treatment (p < 0.05). The small percentage of families who did not feel overwhelmed at study onset (17%), grew to 43% on day 28 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an EHF with synbiotics for the management of infants diagnosed with or suspected to have CMPA suggested a good safety profile, an adequate infant growth, and improvement of overall, gastrointestinal, and dermatological symptoms. It also suggested a lower daily frequency of regurgitations and stools, and an improvement in stool consistency, sleeping pattern, and quality of life of the infant and his family."

      "abstract": "Cow's milk allergy refers to an immunological reaction to milk protein. It is one of the commonest food protein allergies with an estimated prevalence of 0.5% to 3% at 1 y of life. The disease may be IgE or non-IgE mediated or mixed with a wide range of symptoms often involving multiple organ systems. Gastrointestinal manifestations are common in non-IgE disease and may consist of enteropathy, proctocolitis, colic, reflux-like symptoms, constipation, enterocolitis syndrome and eosinophilic esophagitis. The gold standard for diagnosis remains a double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenge. Specific IgE and skin prick tests may predict severe and persistent disease, and aid in deciding on reintroduction or oral immunotherapy; however, they do not contribute to a definitive diagnosis as they indicate only sensitization. In practice, an elimination diet followed by open challenge under medical supervision is often used for diagnosis except when symptoms are severe such as anaphylaxis. Management consists of the elimination of the allergen with resolution of symptoms between 1-4 wk later depending on the type of allergy. Extensively hydrolyzed and Amino acid formulas are used to substitute milk in infants. Soy-based formulas are often utilized in resource-limited settings. Tolerance to the protein develops over time and periodic reintroduction should be attempted every six months after the initial one year of elimination diet. Oral immunotherapy is a newer treatment technique for IgE-mediated disease. There is no firm evidence on prevention apart from recommending breast feeding in early life along with initiating complementary feeding between 4-6 mo age.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is a common condition in infants, but little is known about healthcare providers' clinical experience treating infants with CMPA. To address this gap, we analyzed prospectively collected data from healthcare providers (HCPs) who treated infants under six months old with suspected CMPA using hypoallergenic formulas. The study focused on a commercial extensively hydrolyzed formula containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC53103) (eHF-LGG) or a commercial amino acid formula (AAF). METHODS: In this secondary analysis of prospectively collected survey data, 52 HCPs treated 329 infants under six months old with suspected CMPA using hypoallergenic formulas. A series of two de-identified surveys per patient were collected by HCPs to assess short-term symptom relief in the patients and HCP's satisfaction with the management strategies. The initial survey was completed at the initiation of treatment of CMPA, and the second survey was completed at a follow-up visit. RESULTS: The majority of HCPs (87%) in the study were general pediatricians, and most saw 2 to 10 CMPA patients weekly. Results showed that clinicians reported satisfaction with treatment in 95% of patients in the EHF cohort and 97% of patients in the AAF cohort and achieved expected clinical results in 93% and 97% of patients using eHF and AAF, respectively. Furthermore, few patients were switched from the hypoallergenic formula once initiated. CONCLUSION: The study provides new insights into HCP perspectives on treating infants with CMPA and supports using hypoallergenic formulas to manage this condition. However, additional prospective controlled studies are needed to confirm these initial findings."

To analyze the perspectives of Spanish pediatricians on this topic, a survey was conducted. The survey aimed to determine the current opinions and attitudes of 222 primary care and hospital pediatricians toward CMPA prevention and nutritional management. Participating pediatricians completed the questionnaire, providing insights into their daily clinical practices, including access to testing, attitudes with respect to various aspects of CMPA diagnosis, prevention, oral food challenges, and treatment. The findings revealed that pediatricians generally agree on the use of extensively hydrolyzed formulas (eHFs) to prevent CMPA in high-risk atopic children, despite limited evidence supporting the widespread use of this practice. However, consensus was lacking regarding the utility of formulas with prebiotics and probiotics for expediting tolerance development. In most cases, pediatricians preferred eHFs for the nutritional management of CMPA, followed by hydrolyzed rice formulas (HRFs), with amino-acid-based formulas (AAFs) being the third option. Certain issues remained controversial among pediatricians, such as prevention methods, symptom assessment, and the role of probiotics. These variations in management approaches reflect the influence of clinician experience and area of expertise, underscoring the need for standardized guidelines in this field.",

      "abstract": "Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is an abnormal immune response that severely affects the nutritional supplementation of allergic infants. Currently, only a limited number of hypoallergenic formulas are available on the market, and these are only categorized according to their degree of hydrolysis, which still poses an allergy risk and cannot be consumed by CMA patients, especially infants. To address this issue, we developed a two-step hydrolysis hypoallergenic formula targeting destruction of allergen epitope from whey protein. Then, a comprehensive evaluation system was constructed, including peptidomics analysis, in vivo and in vitro allergenicity assessments, revealing allergic changes in the product from the epitope structure level to the immunological level. The results showed that 97.14% of hydrolyzed peptides from α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin did not contain allergenic epitopes after treatment with trypsin and flavourzyme. In vitro and in vivo allergenicity assessment results confirmed that the two-step hydrolysis method effectively reduced the allergenicity of whey protein. Compared with the common milk powder, the hypoallergenic formula induced lower levels of basophil degranulation and relieved the body's anaphylactic symptoms caused by cow milk. This study provides a promising solution to the limited hypoallergenic formula problem and may benefit allergic infants who require nutritional supplements.",

We conducted a randomized, multicenter intervention study involving 194 non-breastfed infants with CMPA until 12 months of age (clinical trial registration: NCT03085134). One exploratory objective was to assess the effects of a whey-based extensively hydrolyzed formula (EHF) supplemented with 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) on the fecal microbiome and metabolome in this population. Thus, fecal samples were collected at baseline, 1 and 3 months from enrollment, as well as at 12 months of age. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) supplementation led to the enrichment of bifidobacteria in the gut microbiome and delayed the shift of the microbiome composition toward an adult-like pattern. We identified specific HMO-mediated changes in fecal amino acid degradation and bile acid conjugation, particularly in infants commencing the HMO-supplemented formula before the age of three months. Thus, HMO supplementation partially corrected the dysbiosis commonly observed in infants with CMPA. Further investigation is necessary to determine the clinical significance of these findings in terms of a reduced incidence of respiratory infections and other potential health benefits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a promising treatment for food allergies; however, safety is a concern. We synthesized evidence from the best randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on efficacy/safety of OIT for desensitization (DS) and remission (sustained unresponsiveness (SU)) in IgE mediated allergy to peanut, hen's eggs, and cow's milk. BODY: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (Until Oct 22) identifying 16 eligible RCTs published in English measuring food allergy by food challenge at the beginning and at the end of the study. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess study quality. We found 18 eligible studies. There was evidence of efficacy for DS for all allergens: peanut (RR 11.32; 95% CI 5.93, 21.60, I2 49%, 8 studies); hen's egg (RR 4.67; 2.66, 8.21, I2 0%, 5 studies); cow's milk (RR 13.98; 3.51, 55.65, I2 0%, 4 studies) and evidence for SU for peanut (RR 7.74; 2.90, 20.69, I2 0%, 3 studies) and hen's egg (RR 6.91; 1.67, 28.57, I2 0%, 2 studies). Allergic events were increased with intervention, and risk of adrenaline use increased for peanut RR 2.96; 1.63, 5.35, I2 0%, 8 studies; egg RR 1.71; 0.42, 6.92, I2 0%, 6 studies; and milk RR 8.45; 2.02, 35.27, I2 0%, 4 studies. CONCLUSION: We found strong evidence that peanut, hen's egg, and cow's milk OIT can induce DS and some evidence for remission. There was a high risk of allergic reactions. Generalizability to the entire food allergic population is not known."

Effect of replacing non-fat dry milk that used to fortify cow's milk in yoghurt industry with the two extracted galactomannans and commercial galactomannan as food additives was studied. Control yoghurt treatment was made from 3.0% fat cow's milk that was fortified with 1.5% non-fat dry milk. Another 6 yoghurt treatmentwas fortified with 0.15, 0.25% of commercial, guar and microbial galactomannan respectively. All treatments were cultured with the probiotic starter (1.0% Streptococcus thermophilus + 1.0% Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus + 1.0% Bifidobacteriumbifidum). The obtained results indicated that yoghurt supplementation with the three types of galactomannans increased the acidity, curd tension, total solids content, decreased pH values and syneresis of yoghurt treatments. Control yoghurt and commercial galactomannan yoghurt were not significantly different from the corresponding batches those made with either guar galactomannan and microbial galactomannan in fat, protein and ash content. Yoghurt treatments which supplemented with the three types of galactomannans have higher bifidobacteria counts and organoleptic scores than the control treatment yoghurt."

      "abstract": "The development of early-onset cow's milk protein allergy and atopic dermatitis during the first months of life is multifactorial, including both genetic and nutritional aspects. This study aims to assess the impact of different feeding patterns on the incidence of cow's milk protein allergy, atopic dermatitis, and growth among infants with a family history of allergy. A total of 551 high-risk infants were randomly recruited from 3 European countries in three feeding regimens: exclusive breastfeeding, partially hydrolyzed formula, or standard formula with intact protein either exclusively or supplementary to breastfeeding. During the first 6 months of intervention, amongst infants with a family history of atopic dermatitis, 6.5% of partially hydrolyzed formula-fed infants and 22.7% of exclusively breastfed infants (p = 0.007) presented with atopic dermatitis respectively. Growth as assessed by weight increase did not differ between the aforementioned groups. Although cow's milk protein allergy was not related to the different milk feeding regimens in the whole cohort, when adjusting for high breast milk intake, the respective incident was significantly lower in the infants consuming partially hydrolyzed formula (p < 0.001). This data indicates that a specific partially hydrolyzed formula could serve as a more appropriate complement to breast milk compared to a standard intact protein formula in high-risk infants, to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis.",

This study aims to determine the factors including COVID-19 affecting formula compliance of CMPA patients. METHODS: This study is a prospective, observational study based on 10 different Paediatric Allergy-Immunology clinics in Turkey. Patients aged between 6 months and 2 years, who were followed up with IgE-mediated CMPA treatment or newly diagnosed and using breast milk and/or formula were included in the study. The sociodemographic characteristics of the patients, their symptoms, the treatments they received, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adherence to formula were evaluated with a questionnaire administered to the parents. RESULTS: The compliance rate for formula-based treatment was 30.8% (IQR: 28.3, SD: 21.86). The number of patients with a single and multiple food allergy was 127 (51.6%) and 71 (28.9%), respectively. Breastfeeding duration, daily amount of prescribed formula and addition of sweetener to the formula were found to reduce compliance (p = 0.010, p = 0.003, and p = 0.004, respectively). However, it was determined that the patient's height, weight, age at diagnosis, and age of formula onset did not have a significant effect on compliance. CONCLUSION: It was found that the duration of breastfeeding, the increase in the daily amount of formula requirement, and the addition of sweeteners had adverse effects on formula compliance. There was no significant correlation between the formula adherence of CMPA patients and the pandemic."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is a common allergy in infants and can affect proper growth and development. This study verified factors associated with the evolution of the nutritional status (NS) among infants with CMPA fed with hypoallergenic formulas (HF). METHODS: This is a longitudinal study of infants (n = 1036) participating on a governmental program in Brazil. Researchers assessed Nutritional status before HF treatment (T1) and after HF treatment (T2). The causality of exposure variables on the evolution of NS was verified by Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). RESULTS: We observed an increase in anthropometric indexes analyzed with statistically significant results (p < 0.01). The weight/age and height/age scores showed a significant reduction in infants with nutritional deficit. The Body Mass Index (BMI) showed a decrease in the number of infants with nutritional deficit (< -2 z-score). On the other hand, there was an increase in those classified as at risk of overweight, overweight and obese. MLR showed that those who remained < 12 months in the program had a lower odds ratio (95% CI = 0.355-0.906; p = 0.018) to have inadequate NS with increasing BMI. Preterm infants were 4 times more likely (CI 95% = 1.520-10.694; p = 0.005) to have their BMI decreased and those who received nutritional counseling had a lower odds ratio (CI 95% = 0.411-0.953; p = 0.029) to maintain adequate NS. CONCLUSION: The program has a significant impact on the NS of infants with CMPA. The constant management and implementation of differentiated criteria according to the evolution of NS for the supply of HF is fundamental in the continuity of this public policy."

METHODS: Randomized controlled trial involving IgE-mediated CMA children receiving AAF from at least 4 weeks. EHCF + LGG tolerance was evaluated by the results of double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Subjects tolerating EHCF + LGG were randomly allocated to remain on AAF, or to switch to EHCF + LGG. Immune tolerance acquisition to cow's milk proteins was evaluated with DBPCFC after 12 months of treatment. Allergy screening tests and body growth were also monitored. RESULTS: Sixty IgE-mediated CMA children were enrolled. The proportion of children treated with AAF who resulted tolerant to the first exposure of EHCF + LGG was 0.98 (exact 95% CI 0.91-0.99). The rate of the immune tolerance acquisition to cow milk proteins after 12 months treatment was higher in the EHCF + LGG (0.48, 95% exact CI 0.29-0.67, n/N = 14/29) than in the AAF group (0.03, 95% exact CI 0.001-0.17, n/N = 1/30). There was an absolute benefit increase (ABI) of tolerance rate equal to 0.45 (95% CI 0.23-0.63, Newcombe method 10) for EHCF + LGG versus AAF, corresponding to a NNT of 2 (2-4, Bender's method). A normal body growth pattern was observed in the two study groups. CONCLUSION: In IgE-mediated CMA children the step-down from AAF to EHCF + LGG is well tolerated and could facilitate the immune tolerance acquisition.",

      "abstract": "One of the most common food allergies in children is cow's milk allergy (CMA). In breast-fed infants with CMA, the mother is encouraged to avoid dairy products. If this is not possible, or in formula fed infants, use of hypoallergenic replacement formulas such as extensively hydrolyzed formulas (EHF) is recommended. However, in ∼5% of patients EHFs are not tolerated and/or allergy symptoms can persist. When EHFs are ineffective and in severe forms of CMA, amino acid-based formulas (AAF) should be considered. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with extensive experience in food allergy management reviewed scientific publications and international clinical practice guidelines to provide practical recommendations on AAF. The guidelines reviewed had discrepancies and ambiguities around the specific indications for using formulas as a milk substitute. The panel recommends AAFs as the first therapeutic option in anaphylaxis due to CMA, in acute and chronic severe food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, in CMA associated with multiple food allergy, and in cases of eosinophilic esophagitis not responding to an extended exclusion diet or not eating solids. The main benefit of AAF is its absence of residual allergenicity, making it a safe treatment option in severe CMA patients who do not tolerate or respond to an EHF."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the efforts and investments made for traceability and the guarantee of a fair and safe milk product, the informal sector threatens the safety of milk. In fact, during this circuit, the product does not undergo any treatment and therefore presents serious risks for the health of the consumer. In this context, studies have been carried out on samples of peddled milk and products derived from it. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relevance of the informal circuit in Morocco's Doukkala region (El Jadida Province) by physicochemical and microbiological investigation of raw milk and its derivatives at various points of sale. MATERIALS AND METHOD: 84 samples were taken between (23 for raw milk, 30 for the «Lben», and 31 for the «Raib») between January 1st, 2021 and October 30th, 2021. According to Moroccan rules, microbiological analyses revealed an extremely high non-compliance rate in most samples obtained at the level of outlets situated in the El Jadida region, with a non-compliance ratio of 65 percent for raw milk sold, 70 percent for the «Lben», and 40 percent for the «Raib». RESULTS: Likewise, these analyses revealed that majority of the samples did not fulfill international criteria for the pH values of raw milk samples «Lben» and «Raib», which are respectively between 5.85 and 6.71; 4.14 and 4.43 and 4.5. Other characteristics, including lactose, proteins, fat, mineral salts, density, and additional water, have also yielded results. CONCLUSION: This has allowed us to analyze the major impact of the peddling circuit at the regional level, which is a risk factor for consumer health.",

Though the cornerstone of management involves the strict avoidance of milk products while awaiting natural tolerance, research increasingly shows that the rates of resolution are slowing down. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative pathways to promote tolerance to cow's milk in pediatric populations. This review aims to combine and appraise the scientific literature regarding the three CMPA management methods: avoidance, the milk ladder, and oral immunotherapy (OIT) and their outcomes in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunological effects. Cow's milk (CM) avoidance virtually protects against allergic reaction until natural tolerance occurs, with hypoallergenic substitutes available in the market, but accidental ingestion represents the main issue for this strategy. Introduction to baked milk using the milk ladder was designed, with most CMPA patients successfully completing the ladder. Similar to baked milk treatment, many OIT protocols also demonstrated decreased IgE and increased IgG4 levels post protocol, as well as a reduction in wheal size diameter. Though these strategies are shown to be safe and effective in CMPA, future clinical trials should compare the safety and effectiveness of these three management strategies.",

The aim of this study was to identify clinical phenotypes and therapeutic measures for CM anaphylaxis (CMA) compared to HE anaphylaxis (HEA) in children up to 12 years of age, based on a large pan-European dataset from the European Anaphylaxis Registry. METHODS: Data from 2007 to 2020 on clinical phenotypes and treatment from 10 European countries, as well as Brazil, were analysed. The two-step cluster analysis was used to identify the most frequent phenotypes. For each trigger, three clusters were extracted based on sex, age, and existence of symptoms in four vitally important systems. RESULTS: Altogether 284 children with CMA and 200 children with HEA were identified. They were characterised as male (69% vs. 64%), infants (65% vs. 61%), with a most frequent grade III of Ring&Messmer classification (62% vs. 64%), in CMA versus HEA, respectively. Respiratory symptoms occurred more often in CMA (91% vs. 83%, p = 0.010), especially in infants (89% vs. 79%, p = 0.008). Cardiovascular symptoms were less frequent in CMA (30% vs. 44%, p = 0.002), in both infants (33% vs. 46%, p = 0.027), and older children (25% vs. 42%, p = 0.021). The clusters extracted in the CMA group were characterised as: (1) mild dermal infants with severe GI (40%), 2. severe dermal (35%), 3. respiratory (25%). While in HEA group: 1. infants with severe GI and/or reduction of alertness (40%), (2) conjunctival (16%), (3) mild GI without conjunctivitis (44%). The severity of the reaction was independent from the amount of ingested allergen protein, regardless of trigger. The first-line adrenaline application differed between the countries (0%-92%, as well as the reasons for not administering adrenaline, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the similarity of their age, sex, and severity grade, the clinical profiles differed between the CMA and HEA children. Adrenaline was underused, and its administration was country dependent. Further studies are needed to assess to what extent the differences in the clinical profiles are related to matrix and/or absorption effects, and/or the allergen itself."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In children with an allergy to cow's milk proteins (CMA), the altered composition of intestinal microbiota influences the immune tolerance to milk proteins (CMP). This study aims to investigate the effect of probiotics on the phenotype and activation status of peripheral basophils and lymphocytes in a pediatric CMA cohort. METHODS: CMA children underwent 45 days of treatment with Bifidobacteria. The basophil degranulation and the immune phenotype of B cells, T helper cells, and regulatory T cells were analyzed in peripheral blood at diagnosis (T0), after a 45-day probiotic treatment (T1), and 45 days after the probiotic wash-out (T2). RESULTS: We observed in probiotic-treated CMA patients a decrease in naive T lymphocytes. Among the CD3+ cell subsets, both naive and activated CD4+ cells resulted markedly reduced after taking probiotics, with the lowest percentages at T2. A decreased basophil degranulation was observed in response to all analyzed CMP at T1 compared to T0. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic treatment resulted in a decrease of circulating naive and activated CD4+ T cells, as well as degranulating basophils. These data suggest that the Bifidobacteria could have a beneficial effect in the modulation of oral tolerance to CMP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN69069358. URL of registration: https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN69069358 . IMPACT: Probiotic treatment with Bifidobacteria induces a reduction of both naive and activated circulating CD4+ T cells in pediatric patients with cow's milk allergy (CMA). The probiotic supplementation induces a decreased basophil degranulation. The immunological tolerance persists even after 45 days of the probiotic wash-out. Bifidobacteria in vivo supplementation down-modulates the activation of innate and adaptive immunity in pediatric patients with cow's milk allergy. Bifidobacteria contribute to the development of immune tolerance in CMA patients.",

Although several studies have examined the effects of probiotics, few have verified the effects of prebiotic intervention on FA in humans. METHODS: We conducted a preliminary open-label, parallel-group comparison trial in children diagnosed with severe cow's milk allergy (CMA) who were instructed to ingest baked milk (BM; bread or cookies) daily. The subjects either received or did not receive the prebiotic 1-kestose (kestose) daily for 6 months. CMA symptoms and the threshold dose for milk protein were evaluated by oral food challenge with heated milk or BM. Blood and fecal samples were also collected for investigations of the antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels and microbiota composition. RESULTS: Kestose treatment significantly increased the threshold dose for milk protein, and decreased the milk- and casein-specific IgE levels in serum. In those treated with kestose, the abundance of Fusicatenibacter spp. significantly increased in the feces, and a significant inverse correlation was seen between the abundance of Fusicatenibacter spp. and the milk- and casein-specific IgE levels. CONCLUSION: Kestose treatment induced some tolerance to milk protein via changes in the gut microbiota composition in children with FA. IMPACT: A 6-month treatment with the prebiotic kestose increased the threshold dose for milk protein, and decreased the serum levels of milk- and casein-specific IgE in children diagnosed with cow's milk allergy. The kestose treatment increased the abundance of Fusicatenibacter spp. in the gut, which was inversely correlated with the antigen-specific IgE levels. This is the first study to demonstrate that a prebiotic intervention induced some tolerance to an allergen in children with food allergy.",

In this randomised controlled intervention study, we aimed to investigate the tolerance induction of a novel heated cow milk protein, the iAGE product, in 18 children with CMA (diagnosed by a paedriatric allergist). Children who tolerated the iAGE product were included. The treatment group (TG: n = 11; mean age 12.8 months, SD = 4.7) consumed the iAGE product daily with their own diet, and the control group (CG: n = 7; mean age 17.6 months, SD = 3.2) used an eHF without any milk consumption. In each group, 2 children had multiple food allergies. The follow-up procedures consisted of a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with CM t = 0, t = 1 (8 months), t = 2 (16 months), and t = 3 (24 months). At t = 1, eight (73%) of 11 children in the TG had a negative DBPCFC, versus four out of seven (57%) in the CG (BayesFactor = 0.61). At t = 3, nine of the 11 (82%) children in the TG and five of seven (71%) in the CG were tolerant (BayesFactor = 0.51). SIgE for CM reduced from a mean of 3.41 kU/L (SD = 5.63) in the TG to 1.24 kU/L (SD = 2.08) at the end of intervention, respectively a mean of 2.58 (SD = 3.32) in the CG to 0.63 kU/L (SD = 1.06). Product-related AEs were not reported. CM was successfully introduced in all children with negative DBPCFC. We found a standardised, well-defined heated CM protein powder that is safe for daily OIT treatment in a selected group of children with CMA. However, the benefits of inducing tolerance were not observed.",

We aimed to assess the best cut-off point of CoMiSS in our country and investigate other parameters suggested to raise the strength of CoMiSS in CMA diagnosis. METHODS: We enrolled 100 infants with CMA-suggestive symptoms with documentation of CoMiSS initially and 4 weeks after cow milk-free diet (CMFD) followed by an open food challenge (OFC) test. Infants with symptom recurrence upon challenge were diagnosed with confirmed CMA. RESULTS: Initial mean CoMiSS was 15.76 ± 5.29, being higher in the confirmed CMA group (84% of infants). Following CMFD, median CoMiSS significantly reduced to 1.5 in the confirmed CMA group compared to 6.5 in the negative group. Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve identified a CoMiSS score of ≥12 as the best cut-off value with 76.19% sensitivity, 62.50% specificity and overall accuracy of 74.00%. Mucoid stool, bloody stool and faltering growth were reported in 80, 41 and 52% of confirmed CMA infants, respectively, with considerable improvement following CMFD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a CoMiSS score of ≥12 to be the best cut-off point. However, CoMiSS cannot be used alone for accurate diagnosis of CMA. IMPACT: CoMiSS ≥12 can predict a positive response to CMFD; nevertheless, CoMiSS is a good awareness tool and cannot be regarded as a stand-alone CMA diagnostic test. CoMiSS reduction following CMFD was predictive of a reaction to OFC to diagnose CMA as well as for monitoring symptom improvement. Symptoms commonly associated with CMA as mucoid stool, bloody stool, marked abdominal distention not responding to medical treatment and faltering growth, in addition to their improvements in response to CMA are suggested parameters to be added to CoMiSS to improve its accuracy.",

In this context, dietary intake of children with CMA should be particularly checked and monitored. The objective of this study was to assess the applicability, usability, and accuracy of a new dietary intake (DI) assessment online tool (Nutricate© online application) for managing CMA in children. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study used a pre-existing database of DI from the Nutricate© online application. DIs from 30 CMA children were used to compare micro/macronutrients (energy, protein, calcium, and iron intakes) calculated by Nutricate© and NutriLog© as the reference method. Comparisons were performed using the Pearson correlation analysis and the Bland-Altman plot. The Nutricate© tool usability was assessed via a System Usability Scale questionnaire (SUSq). RESULTS: Correlation coefficient between the levels of micro/macronutrients obtained by Nutrilog© and Nutricate© software were highly significant (p = 0.0001) and were well-correlated (R coefficient > 0.6), indicating a very good concordance between the two methods. This observation was reinforced by the Bland-Altman plot, indicating the absence of proportional or fixed bias for energy, protein, calcium, and iron intakes. The mean SUSq score obtained was 81 ± 14, which is considered to be an excellent score. CONCLUSIONS: Nutricate© online application is a reliable method to assess micro/macronutrient (energy, protein, calcium, and iron intakes) intake in CMA children. Applicability and usability of this new dietary intake assessment online tool is excellent.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lactose intolerance (LI) is commonly seen in East Asian countries. Several studies showed that lactose or milk loading has been used as a treatment for lactose malabsorption (LM) in Western countries, but there have been no reports regarding this type of treatment in Japan. As lactose or milk loading requires ingestion of large amounts of lactose within a short period, this is considered to be too harsh for Japanese people because of their less habitual milk consumption (175 mL per day in average) than Western people. In this study, we demonstrated lactose tolerance acquisition in a suitable way for Japanese. AIM: To examine the efficacy of lactose (cow's milk) loading treatment in patients with LM. METHODS: Individuals with abdominal symptoms induced by milk or dairy products (LI symptoms) were identified with a questionnaire. A 20 g lactose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) was carried out to confirm LM diagnosis and to evaluate co-existence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Respondents diagnosed with LM were selected as study subjects and were treated with incremental loads of cow's milk, starting from 30 mL and increasing up to 200 mL at 4-7 d intervals. After the treatment, changes in symptoms and LM diagnostic value of 20 g LHBT were investigated. Stool samples pre- and post-treatment were examined for changes in intestinal microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing. Informed consent was obtained prior to each stage of the study. RESULTS: In 46 subjects with LI symptoms (10-68 years old, mean age 34 years old) identified with the questionnaire, 35 (76.1%) were diagnosed with LM by 20 g LHBT, and 6 had co-existing SIBO. The treatment with incremental cow's milk was carried out in 32 subjects diagnosed with LM (14-68 years old, median age 38.5 years old). The mean period of the treatment was 41 ± 8.6 d. Improvement of symptoms was observed in 29 (90.6%; 95% confidence interval: 75.0%-98.0 %) subjects. Although 20 g LHBT indicated that 10 (34.5%) subjects had improved diagnostic value of LM, no change was observed in 16 (55.2%) subjects. Analysis of the fecal intestinal microbiota showed a significant increase in Blautia in 7 subjects who became symptom-free after the treatment (P = 0.0313). CONCLUSION: LM was diagnosed in approximately 75% of the subjects who had LI. Incremental loads of cow's milk is regarded as a useful treatment for LM without affecting everyday life."

We sought to explore the efficacy and feasibility of a combination of heat-killed Lactiplantibacillus plantarum YIT 0132 (LP0132) and oral immunotherapy for treating IgE-mediated cow milk allergy (CMA). We conducted a 24-week, double-blind, randomised (1:1), two-arm, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of LP0132 intervention for treating IgE-mediated CMA in children aged 1-18 years (n=60) from January 29, 2018 to July 12, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan. Participants were randomly assigned to the LP0132 group receiving citrus juice fermented with LP0132 or to the control group receiving citrus juice without. Both groups received low-dose slow oral immunotherapy with CM. The primary outcome was improved tolerance to CM, proven by the CM challenge test at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were changes in serum biomarkers of serum-specific β-lactoglobulin-IgE (sIgE) and β-lactoglobulin-IgG4 (sIgG4). Exploratory outcomes included changes in serum cytokine levels and gut microbiota composition. A total of 61 participants were included. Finally, 31 children were assigned to the LP0132 group and 30 to the control group, respectively. After the intervention, 41.4 and 37.9% of the participants in the LP0132 and control groups, respectively, showed improved tolerance to CM. In serum biomarkers after the intervention, the sIgG4 level was significantly higher, and interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-9 were significantly lower, in the LP0132 group than in the control group. In the gut microbiome, the α-diversity and Lachnospiraceae increased significantly in the LP0132 group, and Lachnospiraceae after the intervention was significantly higher in the LP0132 group than in the control group. In conclusion, low-dose oral immunotherapy with modulating gut microbiota might be a safer and more effective approach for treating cow's milk allergy.",

CASE REPORT: We report on a 22-year-old male with severe cow's milk allergy with multiple anaphylactic reactions, known since infancy and persisting into adulthood with sometimes severe immediate-type reactions on accidental ingestion. The prick test for native whole milk was positive, the CAP-FEIA was also positive for milk protein, mare's milk, whey, sheep's milk whey as well as Bos d4, Bos d5, and Bos d8 and blue cheese; total IgE was 1,265 kU/L. The patient's history included well-controlled bronchial asthma. An off-label therapy with omalizumab (3 × 150 mg/month SC) and cetirizine 10 mg once daily was initiated. Under this therapy, we performed a double-blind oral exposure test to cow's milk in the patient after long term. Thereby 14 mL could be tolerated. After consumption of 30 mL of cow's milk, urticaria, dyspnea, and angioedema occurred. CONCLUSION: Under therapy with omalizumab, an increase of the tolerance to cow's milk was shown in our patient. As a consequence, reactions during accidental consumption could be prevented."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review evaluates cow milk's impact on breast carcinogenesis by linking recent epidemiological evidence and new insights into the molecular signaling of milk and its constituents in breast cancer (BCa) pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent prospective cohort studies support the association between cow's milk consumption and the risk of estrogen receptor-α-positive (ER+) BCa. Milk is a complex biological fluid that increases systemic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin and estrogen signaling, and interacting hormonal promoters of BCa. Further potential oncogenic components of commercial milk include exosomal microRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-21-5p), bovine meat and milk factors, aflatoxin M1, bisphenol A, pesticides, and micro- and nanoplastics. Individuals with BRCA1 loss-of-function mutations and FTO and IGF1 gain-of-function polymorphisms enhancing IGF-1/mTORC1 signaling may be at increased risk for milk-induced ER+ BCa. Recent prospective epidemiological and pathobiochemical studies identify commercial milk consumption as a critical risk factor of ER+ BCa. Large meta-analyses gathering individuals of different ethnic origins with milk derived from dairy cows of varying genetic backgrounds and diverse feeding procedures as well as missing data on thermal processing of milk (pasteurization versus ultra-heat treatment) make multi-national meta-analyses unsuitable for BCa risk estimations in susceptible populations. Future studies are required that consider all vulnerable periods of breast carcinogenesis to cow's milk exposure, beginning during the perinatal period and puberty, since these are the most critical periods of mammary gland morphogenesis. Notwithstanding the need for better studies including detailed information on milk processing and vulnerable periods of human breast carcinogenesis, the available evidence suggests that dietary guidelines on milk consumption may have to be reconsidered.",

      "abstract": "Immunological mechanisms of non-IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) are not well understood. Such a circumstance requires attention with the aim of discovering new biomarkers that could lead to better diagnostic assays for early treatment. Here, we sought both to investigate the mechanism that underlies non-IgE-mediated CMPA and to identify cow's milk immunoreactive proteins in a Mexican pediatric patient group (n = 34). Hence, we determined the IgE and IgG1-4 subclass antibody levels against cow's milk proteins (CMP) by ELISA. Then, we performed 2D-Immunoblots using as first antibody immunoglobulins in the patients'serum that bound specifically against CMP together with CMP enrichment by ion-exchange chromatography. Immunoreactive proteins were identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The serological test confirmed absence of specific IgE in the CMPA patients but showed significant increase in antigen-specific IgG1. Additionally, we identified 11 proteins that specifically bound to IgG1. We conclude that the detection of specific IgG1 together with an immunoproteomics approach is highly relevant to the understanding of CMPA's physiopathology and as a possible aid in making a prognosis since current evidence indicates IgG1 occurrence as an early signal of potential risk toward development of IgE-mediated food allergy. SIGNIFICANCE: Allergies are one of the most studied topics in the field of public health and novel protein allergens are found each year. Discovery of new principal and regional allergens has remarkable repercussions in precise molecular diagnostics, prognostics, and more specific immunotherapies. In this context, specific IgE is widely known to mediate physiopathology; however, allergies whose mechanism does not involve this immunoglobulin are poorly understood although their incidence has increased. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment are delayed with significant consequences on the health of pediatric patients. The study of type and subtypes of immunoglobulins associated with the immunoreactivity of cow's milk proteins together with an immunoproteomics approach allows better comprehension of physiopathology, brings the opportunity to discover new potential cow's milk protein allergens and may help in prognosis prediction (IgG1 occurrence as an early signal of possible risk toward development of IgE-mediated food allergy).",

      "abstract": "Cow milk allergy (CMA) is a prevalent disease in childhood. Natural history is usually favorable as CMA can disappear by school age in many subjects. Diagnosis corresponds to treatment, as an elimination diet is a solution. However, cow's milk (CM) is real food, hardly replaceable. Thus, CM reintroduction represents a demanding challenge in clinical practice. The induction of CM tolerance could be achievable using oral immunotherapy (OIT), such as the administration of increasing milk quantities until reaching tolerance. However, the OIT schedule and procedure need to be better standardized, and performance may vary widely. Therefore, the present study reports the practical experience of a third-level pediatric allergy center in managing children with CMA and submitting them to OIT. OFC and OIT are relatively safe procedures as the reaction rate is low. Almost two-thirds of the OIT subjects tolerated CM. Reactions were associated with high IgE levels. Therefore, the present experience, developed by a qualified center, may suggest and propose a practical approach for managing children with CMA. After the initial workup, including a thorough history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, OFC and, when indicated, OIT could be performed in most children with CMA."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases are increasing globally and are a significant public health challenge, especially in children. Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most common food allergies in early childhood. When CMA is diagnosed and exclusive breastfeeding is not possible, current guidelines recommend extensively hydrolyzed formulas (eHF) or amino acid-based formulas (AAF), depending on the diagnosis and severity of symptoms. Hydrolyzed rice formulas (HRF) are considered an alternative to eHF and AAF where available. OBJECTIVES & METHODS: We aimed to understand how HRF are being used and their position in the management of CMA, and to generate consensus on indications for use. Two virtual roundtables of international healthcare experts in pediatric food allergy focused on HRF were convened in May and October 2021. Experts provided multiple perspectives due to different specialties, locations, healthcare settings, and availability of HRF. Following discussion of international CMA guidelines and HRF use, identification of challenges along the diagnosis and treatment pathway, and translation of guidelines into clinical practice, an expert consensus on the use of HRF for CMA was developed. This involved repeated voting followed by statement amendment to reach 100% agreement. This publication summarizes insights from these meetings. RESULTS: There was 100% agreement on all 8 statements: (1) While breastmilk is the best source of nutrition for infants with CMA, when breastfeeding is not possible, a hypoallergenic formula can be used; (2) Per definition, a HRF is cow's milk protein-free; (3) A minority of infants with immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated CMA react to eHF due to residual cow's milk protein; (4) More infants with non-IgE-mediated CMA than IgE-mediated CMA react to eHF likely due to residual cow's milk protein; (5) When a diagnostic elimination diet is indicated, HRF can be used; (6) A HRF can be recommended as a first-line option for CMA, where available, as outlined in the Diagnosis and Rationale for Action against Cow's Milk Allergy guidelines; (7) HRFs have proven hypoallergenicity and are suitable for the dietary management of CMA; (8) HRFs have been shown to support growth in infants with CMA, similar to other hypoallergenic formulas. Participants recommend healthcare professionals take these statements as guidance to use HRF in clinical practice. Based on efficacy and growth evidence, the experts found HRF a suitable option for the dietary management of CMA. CONCLUSION: HRF can be recommended as a first-line alternative to cow's milk-based eHF or AAF, where available, in the dietary management of CMA."

      "abstract": "Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most prevalent food allergy (FA) in infancy and early childhood and can be present with various clinical phenotypes. The significant increase in FA rates recorded in recent decades has been associated with environmental and lifestyle changes that limit microbial exposure in early life and induce changes in gut microbiome composition. Gut microbiome is a diverse community of microbes that colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and perform beneficial functions for the host. This complex ecosystem interacts with the immune system and has a pivotal role in the development of oral tolerance to food antigens. Emerging evidence indicates that alterations of the gut microbiome (dysbiosis) in early life cause immune dysregulation and render the host susceptible to immune-mediated diseases later in life. Therefore, the colonization of the gut by \"healthy\" microbes that occurs in the first years of life determines the lifelong health of the host. Here, we present current data on the possible role of the gut microbiome in the development of CMA. Furthermore, we discuss how gut microbiome modification might be a potential strategy for CMA prevention and treatment.",

Several cases of PLE combined with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA) have been reported in infants and toddlers that were considered to result from excessive cow's milk consumption, although the mechanism has not been clearly established. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and radiologic characteristics of patients diagnosed and treated for PLE with IDA between 2015 and 2021. Long-term outcomes were analyzed according to dietary intervention during the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients aged 7.0-26.7 months were enrolled in the study and the median follow-up duration of them was 9.4 months (range, 1.3-18.0). Six of them were fed powdered formula, while two were fed whole cow's milk, and their median daily intake was 700 mL (range, 300-900). The times to normalization of hemoglobin, albumin, and eosinophil count were shorter in patients with dietary elimination of cow's milk protein immediately after diagnosis compared to those with reduced intake or no dietary change. CONCLUSION: Early complete elimination of cow's milk protein should be considered, especially if the laboratory parameters are not normalized with adequate iron supplementation even though the clinical symptoms show improvement. We would like to draw attention to the possibility of the cow's milk protein in the pathogenesis of the condition through the non-IgE-mediated immune reactions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGOUND: Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most common allergy in infants that decreases the quality of life of patients and their families. Standard treatment for CMA is the strict avoidance of milk; new treatment strategies such as oral immunotherapy (OIT) have been sought for patients with CMA. We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of OIT in the treatment of children with immunoglobulin E-mediated CMA (IMCMA). METHODS: We searched all randomized controlled trials in which OIT is used to treat children with IMCMA from five international electronic databases. We estimated a pooled risk ratio (RR) for each outcome using a Mantel-Haenzel fixed-effects model if statistical heterogeneity was low. RESULTS: Eleven studies were chosen for meta-analysis, including a total of 469 children (242 OITs, 227 controls). One hundred and seventy-six patients (72.7%) in the OIT were desensitized compared with 49 patients (21.6%) in the control group (RR: 7.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.82-19.13, p &lt; .0001). The desensitization effect of OIT was particularly significant in children over 3 years old (RR: 18.05, 95% CI: 6.48-50.26, p &lt; .00001). Although adverse effects were common, they usually involved mild reactions, but epinephrine use was more common in the OIT group (RR: 7.69, 95% CI: 2.16-27.33, p &lt; .002). CONCLUSION: OIT can lead to desensitization in the majority of individuals with IMCMA, especially in patients over 3 years old. A major problem of OIT is the frequency of adverse events, although most are mild. OIT may be an alternative treatment in the future.",

METHODS: This was an open-label, single arm study evaluating body growth pattern in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated CMPA infants receiving a new AAF for 6 months. The outcomes were anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference), adherence to the study formula and occurrence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Fifteen children [all Caucasian and born at term; 53.3% born with spontaneous delivery; 80% male; 80% with familial allergy risk; mean age (±SD) 3 ± 2.5 months at IgE-mediated CMPA diagnosis; mean age (±SD) 16.7 ± 5.9 months at enrolment, mean total serum IgE (±SD) 298.2 ± 200.4 kU/L] were included and completed the 6-month study. Data from fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy controls were also adopted as comparison. At baseline, all CMPA patients were weaned and were receiving the new AAF. All 15 patients completed the 6-month study period. For the entire CMPA pediatric patients' cohort, from baseline to the end of the study period, the body growth pattern resulted within the normal range of World Health Organization (WHO) growth references and resulted similar to healthy controls anthropometric values. The formula was well tolerated. The adherence was optimal and no AEs related to AAF use were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The new AAF ensured normal growth in subjects affected by IgE-mediated CMPA. This formula constitutes another suitable safe option for the management of pediatric patients affected by CMPA."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is an abnormal immune response caused by milk proteins and is most common in infancy and early childhood. Statistics revealed up to 7.5% of children suffered from milk allergy. Its clinical symptoms were characterized by diversity, non-specificity, and can affect multiple systems, including the digestive tract, skin, and respiratory tract. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A on diagnosing and monitoring CMPA in children for clinical treatment. METHODS: A total of 158 infants with CMPA and 89 healthy babies were recruited and evaluated. Demographic and clinical information of all participants were recorded. An extensive analysis of inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A, was performed in blood samples from 247 infants younger than 9 months. Meanwhile, the serological specificity immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels were evaluated. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) values of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A in differentiating CMP from healthy babies were measured by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, the correlation between sIgE and IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A levels were detected using Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: Compared with healthy control, infants who developed CMPA had decreased IL-12, increased IL-16, and IL-17A. Moreover, a significant correlation between serum IL-12, IL-16, IL-17A and sIgE levels was observed in the CMPA group. In addition, AUC values of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A in discriminating CMPA from healthy infants were 0.8425, 0.9196, and 0.8813, respectively. Finally, IL-12 was increased while IL-16 and IL-17A levels were decreased in the CMPA group after three months of milk avoidance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We found that IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A levels in children with CMPA were associated with SCORAD scores, sIgE levels, and disease severity, functioning as valuable disease-monitor markers in CMPA.",

METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to April 2022 were searched for relevant studies. Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using the forest plot. Heterogeneity was used to determine the fixed or random-effect model. RESULTS: Twelve studies including 310 patients and 217 controls were available for the meta-analysis. The FC levels in children with CMPA were significantly higher than in healthy control (SMD = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.38-1.91). After elimination diet treatment, FC levels were reduced considerably with the pooled SMD of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.48-1.26). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that FC could be a simple and reliable biomarker for diagnosing CMPA, especially in non-IgE-mediated CMPA infants. Besides, calprotectin was also potential for predicting therapy response of CMPA.",

      "abstract": "Of the many symptoms associated with cow's milk allergy (CMA), many populations face the burden of the appearance or worsening of atopic dermatitis (AD) when consuming milk products. Due to the prevalence and possible severity of symptoms, it is important to understand the underlying immune mechanisms involved in such reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions are exaggerated immune responses to often benign antigens, many times resulting in a cascade of pro-inflammatory processes. Of the four major types, type I and IV are of most relevance when considering atopic dermatitis worsened by cow's milk. Considered a \"true allergy,\" type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reactions occur within hours after secondary exposure to an allergen and are primarily driven by antibodies and humoral immune responses. On the contrary, type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reactions are driven by cell-mediated responses involving T-cell activation. Due to the array of symptoms induced by these complex reactions, it is imperative to diagnose early and treat appropriately. In this literature review, we aim to highlight the primary underlying immune contributors to hypersensitivity reactions, discuss AD as a manifestation of hypersensitivity reactions to cow's milk, and consider current and future treatment options for combatting hypersensitivities manifesting as AD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most common food allergies among children. Whilst avoidance of cow's milk protein is the cornerstone of management, further treatment of symptoms including those affecting the gastrointestinal, skin and respiratory systems plus other allergic comorbidities, maybe required. This study aimed to quantify the wider economic impact of CMA and its management in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study on children with CMA (diagnosis read code and/or hypoallergenic formula prescription for ≥3 months) examining healthcare data (medication prescriptions and healthcare professional contacts) from case records within The Health Improvement Network (A Cegedim Proprietary Database) in the UK. A comparative cost analysis was calculated based on healthcare tariff and unit costs in the UK. RESULTS: 6998 children (54% male; mean observation period 4.2 years) were included (n = 3499 with CMA, mean age at diagnosis 4.04 months; n = 3499 matched controls without CMA). Compared to those without CMA, medications were prescribed to significantly more children with CMA (p < 0.001) at a higher rate (p < 0.001). Children with CMA also required significantly more healthcare contacts (p < 0.001) at higher rate (p < 0.001) compared to those without CMA. CMA was associated with additional potential healthcare costs of £1381.53 per person per year. CONCLUSION: The findings of this large cohort study suggest that CMA and its associated co-morbidities presents a significant additional healthcare burden with economic impact due to higher prescribing of additional medications. Further research into management approaches that may impact these clinical and economic outcomes of CMA is warranted."

      "abstract": "Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is a common condition in the pediatric population. CMA can induce a diverse range of symptoms of variable intensity. It occurs mainly in the first year of life, and if the child is not breastfed, hypoallergenic formula is the dietary treatment. Extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk formulas (eHF) with documented hypo-allergenicity can be recommended as the first choice, while amino acid-based formulas (AAF) are recommended for patients with more severe symptoms. Hydrolyzed rice-based formulas (HRFs) are a suitable alternative for infants with CMA that cannot tolerate or do not like eHF and in infants with severe forms of CMA. In the present paper, we reviewed the nutritional composition of HRFs as well as studies regarding their efficacy and tolerance in children, and we provided an updated overview of the recent evidence on the use of HRFs in CMA. The available studies provide evidence that HRFs exhibit excellent efficacy and tolerance and seem to be adequate in providing normal growth in healthy children as well as in children with CMA."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of OIT on blocking antibodies, T cell regulation, and cytokine response during immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) treatment. METHODS: A total of 59 children with IgE-mediated CMA who were followed in pediatric allergy outpatient clinic and 18 healthy children were included. The children were evaluated in the following 4 groups: OIT group, elimination group (patients receiving dairy elimination diet), tolerance group (patients who developed tolerance), and healthy control group. Milk-specific IgE, IgG4, and IgA levels, cow's milk induration diameters in skin prick test, CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg cell percentages, messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions, and interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13 cytokine levels were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 42.6 ± 39 (6-201) months, and 63.6% (n = 49) of the patients were girls. We observed an increase in total IgE levels (P = .02), a decrease in cow's milk sIgE (P = .08, NS), and an increase in cow's milk component (β-lactoglobulin and casein) specific IgA (P < .05) and IgG4 (P < .001) levels at 2 months after the maintenance phase of OIT. In addition, the immune response after OIT treatment, which had a 100% clinical success rate, was notable for similar CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + cell percentages (P = .8), and increased IL-10 (P = .04) levels and increased but statistically nonsignificant TGF-β levels (P = .17) compared with those before treatment. FoxP3 mRNA expression was similar to that of patients who developed natural tolerance. Pretreatment and post-treatment FoxP3 mRNA-FoxP3 flow cytometric expressions were positively correlated with TGF-β concentrations in the OIT group. CONCLUSION: A successful immune response to OIT was found, possibly through the blockage of IgE-mediated allergen presentation by blocking antibodies, marked IL-10 cytokine response, and TGF-β response. FoxP3 mRNA expression was similar to the natural tolerance mechanism, but more studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cow's milk allergy is a common type of allergy in infants that is caused by the immune response to proteins in cow's milk. Digestive manifestations, atopic dermatitis, and respiratory discomfort are some of the clinical manifestations that appear; however, none of them are objective criteria to confirm the diagnosis, which may result in misdiagnosis, treatment hindrance, and parental concerns. Therefore, new methodologies for an accurate and immediate diagnosis is essential. METHODS: In this descriptive study, infants referred to the pediatric health center in Sulaymaniah were selected during a period of 1 year. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and the Cow's Milk Related Symptom Score (CoMiSS). Chi-squared and independent t tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The findings of the present study indicated that among 250 infants (117 boys, 133 girls), with a mean ±  SD age of 2.9 ± 1.6 years, 21% were breastfed, 39% were fed both cow's milk and breast milk, and 60% were fed only cow's milk. The contingency of cow's milk allergy was positive in 35% of infants. According to this questionnaire, 18% of the participants got a score of 0-5, 47% scored 6-11, and 35% scored ≥ 12. A significant relationship was found between cow's milk allergy and the participants' diet (p < 0.001). A significant association was also found between age-dependent growth index (weight p = 0.04, height p = 0.01, and head circumstance p = 0.02) and cow's milk allergy. CONCLUSION: Although common problems in infancy such as colic and reflux may interfere with an accurate diagnosis of cow's milk allergy, give false-positive results, and decrease the reliability of CoMiSS; there is a need for non-invasive and easy methods for early diagnosis and improving awareness to encourage parents to take preventive measures."

Milk was collected from 23 cows from the IMT group and 27 cows from the CTL group. IMT and DRY samples had a greater correlation with the genera Brevibacterium and Amaricoccus, and the family Micrococcaceae, when compared to IMT and FRESH samples. CTL group samples collected at DRY had a greater correlation with the genera Akkermansia and Syntrophus, when compared to FRESH samples; no bacterial taxa were observed to have a significant correlation with FRESH samples in the CTL group. DRY samples collected from the CTL group had a greater correlation with the genus Mogibacterium when compared to IMT and CTL samples. For DRY samples collected from the IMT group, a greater correlation with the genus Alkalibacterium when compared to DRY and CTL samples, was observed. The lack of a correlation for FRESH samples between the CTL and IMT treatment groups indicated that intramammary antimicrobial dry cow therapy had no significant effect on the udder milk microbiota post-partum."

The purpose of this study is to examine decisions made by mothers of infants having cow milk protein allergy, and physicians concerning the palatability of unflavored extensively hydrolyzed formulas and amino acid-based formulas. We conducted a multi-center, randomized, single-blinded, observational taste study involving 149 pediatricians from gastroenterology and allergy subspecialties at 14 tertiary healthcare units from different regions of Turkey and involving 94 mothers of infants with cow milk protein allergy. Blinding was performed for seven formulas available in the market, which were the most commonly prescribed for feeding: four AAFs (Neocate-Numil®, Aptamil Pregomin AS-Numil®, Alfamino-Nestle®, Comidagen-Mamma®), one AAF specifically designed to address the growing nutritional and lifestyle needs of children >1 year (Neocate Junior-Numil®), 2 eHFs (Bebelac Pepti Junior-Numil®, Similac Alimentum-Abott®). Considering all three formula characteristics, Neocate junior-Numil® ranked as the number 1 product among seven products by mothers (63.8%) and physicians (69.8%). The ratings of mothers were significantly higher than the physicians (8.1 points and 6.1 points, respectively; p < 0.001). No difference was found in terms of taste, smell, and appearance for Neocate junior-Numil® between the mothers' and physicians' ratings. Since caregivers have responsibility for careful selection of replacement products for infants with cow milk protein allergy, it is noteworthy that increased awareness and confidence in the palatability characteristics of these products should motivate mothers and physicians to comply with replacement treatment in the long term.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the experiences and attitudes of parents of children with allergy to cow's milk and other FA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The parents of children with FA were asked to complete an 18-item questionnaire to evaluate the FA history and experiences during diagnosis, treatment, and follow up. RESULTS: The data from 558 (91.2%) survey questionnaire that were filled completely were analyzed. The mean age of the parents was 33.4+4.9. It was found that most common food allergen was cow's milk (85.3%). The mean time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms was 10.9±18.4 months. Around 229 parents (41.6%) admitted to at least four different physicians and 68 (12.3%) parents admitted to at least five different physicians before diagnosis. The median time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms was five (1-108) months in the patients admitted to four or more physicians, but it was one (1-48) month in the patients that admitted to less physicians (p˂0.001). The most common symptoms were dermatitis and mucus-bloody stool, the least common ones were cardiovascular symptoms. Only 21.1% of the patients were able to use hypoallergenic formulas (HAF) in accordance with the recommendation of the physician. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed diagnosis of FA is a major concern, and during this period the patients admit many physicians. A majority of the patients with CMPA experience difficulties while using HAFs, and only one-fifth of them is able to use formula regularly.",

The introduced preventive measures and differential diagnostics, including oral food challenges, are the gold standard for determining further treatment planning. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of an 18-year-old girl with a cow's milk allergy who underwent an oral food challenge (double blind oral food challenge). Such a challenge may be confounded by inducing a response from other systems and organs, which provides theoretical grounds for the use of other methods of assessing the body's response to food allergens (response demonstrated by the upper respiratory tract). Based on this idea, in order to assess the degree of mucosal response, we used optical rhinometry as an objective method for nasal patency evaluation, as well as identification of tryptase level in nasal lavage fluid and exfoliative cytology of nasal mucosa. The results of these tests confirmed positive reaction of the nasal mucosa in the course of the oral allergen challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The observed increase in the nasal mucosal reactivity that accompanies oral food challenges may suggest a potential for using food allergens in nasal allergen provocation testing in order to diagnose food allergies."

OBJECTIVES: Hypoallergenicity, growth, and gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of a new extensively hydrolyzed whey-protein formula (eHWF) in CMA children were assessed. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, international, multi-center study (Trial NL3889), 34 children with confirmed CMA (74% IgE-mediated) underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with an eHWF developed with non-porcine enzymes, supplemented with prebiotic short-chain galacto- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (0.8 g/L, ratio 9:1), arachidonic acid (0.35/100 g), and docosahexaenoic acid (0.35/100 g). If tolerant to the eHWF, children participated in a 7-day open food challenge with this eHWF. Anthropometrics and GI tolerability were assessed in an optional 16-weeks follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 34 children who started the DBPCFC with the eHWF, 25 subjects (19 boys, mean age: 61 weeks, 18 with IgE-mediated CMA) completed the DBPCFC and 7-day open challenge without major protocol deviations and tested negative at both challenges. One child experienced a late moderate eczematous allergic reaction in the optional follow-up period, indicating the need for close monitoring of subjects starting new formula. Weight and length gain followed the World Health Organization growth curves. Changes in frequency and consistency of stools upon test formula intake were transient. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed eHWF is a suitable option in CMA treatment as all subjects tolerated the product. This result is in line with the international criteria for hypoallergenicity (American Academy of Pediatrics) that state that more than 90% of CMA children must tolerate the formula. Use of the formula is also associated with normal growth curves and GI tolerability. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial NL3889, https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/3889.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of partially hydrolyzed formulas (pHF) as part of nutritional interventions to prevent the development of allergic manifestations (AM) is questioned, and efficacy of each specific pHF should be substantiated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk-reduction effect of a whey-based pHF on the development of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) and atopic dermatitis (AD) in infants at high-risk for allergy within the first 6 months of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a multicenter double-blinded randomized controlled setting, healthy non-exclusively breastfed full-term infants, received either a specific whey-based pHF or a standard cow's milk-based formula (SF) and were clinically assessed for AM at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, supported by the objective scoring tools SCORAD and CoMiSS. CMPA was confirmed by open food challenge. Intention-to-Treat (ITT) and Per-Protocol (PP) analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 331 randomized subjects (ITT analysis set), 160 received the pHF and 171 the SF. Six (3.8%) infants in the pHF and 12 (7%) in the SF group developed CMPA (p = 0.186). AD incidence was significantly lower in those receiving pHF as compared to SF (10.6% vs. 18.7%, p = 0.024) with a relative risk (RR, 95% CI) of 0.54 (0.32, 0.92), in particular when adjusting for family history of AD [6.5% vs. 27.3%, RR 0.24 (0.07, 0.78), p = 0.018] representing a risk reduction of 76%. The PP analysis showed similar results. CONCLUSION: This specific whey-based pHF reduced the risk of AD development, particularly in those with a family history of AD, and tended to reduce the development of CMPA in non-exclusively breastfed infants at high-risk for allergy. The A.R.T. study suggests that this particular pHF may contribute to measures aimed at prevention of allergic manifestations. However, further studies are needed to confirm this risk-reduction effect."

      "abstract": "This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter trial (Registration: NCT03661736) aimed to assess if an amino acid-based formula (AAF) supplemented with two human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) supports normal growth and is well tolerated in infants with a cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). Term infants aged 1-8 months with moderate-to-severe CMPA were enrolled. The study formula was an AAF supplemented with 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT). Infants were fed the study formula for 4 months and were offered to remain on the formula until 12 months of age. Tolerance and safety were assessed throughout the trial. Out of 32 infants (mean age 18.6 weeks; 20 (62.5%) male), 29 completed the trial. During the 4-month principal study period, the mean weight-for-age Z score (WAZ) increased from -0.31 at the baseline to +0.28 at the 4-months' follow-up. Linear and head growth also progressed along the WHO child growth reference, with a similar small upward trend. The formula was well tolerated and had an excellent safety profile. When comparing the microbiome at the baseline to the subsequent visits, there was a significant on-treatment enrichment in HMO-utilizing bifidobacteria, which was associated with a significant increase in fecal short-chain fatty acids. In addition, we observed a significant reduction in the abundance of fecal Proteobacteria, suggesting that the HMO-supplemented study formula partially corrected the gut microbial dysbiosis in infants with CMPA.",

The present study aimed to evaluate and identify clinical and laboratory biomarkers of adverse events during OIT among children with cow's milk (CM) allergy. Study Design: Eighty-six children older than 36 months who had undergone OIT with milk were enrolled. Clinical data, oral food challenge (OFC) test results, and laboratory data were recorded retrospectively. Results: The median duration of the build-up phase of OIT was 19 weeks (min 10-max 40) and the duration of the maintenance phase was 86.5 (min 1-max 132) months. A total of 11,767 CM doses were administered during the build-up phase and adverse reactions were seen in 62 (73.8%) patients with reactions registered for 157 doses among 11,767 (1/75 doses). The number of reactions during the maintenance phase was 41 (47.6%) in 24 (27.9%) patients. There was a significant reduction in the number of reactions (P = 0.000) between the build-up phase and maintenance phase. Adverse reactions and anaphylaxis were higher for patients who had cough during OFC (P = 0.003, P = 0.002, respectively) during the build-up phase and also during the maintenance phase too (P = 0.000). Evaluation for all reactions and anaphylaxis (during build-up and maintenance) with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis showed class IV-VI of CM-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), casein-sIgE and cough during OFC were significantly associated with increased probability of reaction and anaphylaxis. Younger age at onset of OIT was associated with risk reduction (0.017). Conclusion: Laboratory data and reactions during the OFC (especially cough) can help to identify high-risk patients during OIT.",

Despite the fact that there are different guidelines and recommendations on the management of children with CMPA, there continues to be great variability in diagnostic and therapeutic criteria in Latin America. The Food Allergy Working Group of the Latin American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition summoned a group of Latin American experts to reach a consensus and formulate a document to unify diagnostic and therapeutic criteria for CMPA. Three teams were formed, each with a coordinator, and the members of each team developed a series of statements for their corresponding module: a) clinical manifestations and diagnosis; b) diagnostic tools, and c) treatment. A search of the medical literature was carried out to support the information presented in each module and 28 statements were then selected. The statements were discussed, after which they were evaluated by all the experts, utilizing the Delphi method. Their opinions on statement agreement or disagreement were anonymously issued. The final statements selected were those with above 75% agreement and their corresponding recommendations were formulated, resulting in the document presented herein.",
