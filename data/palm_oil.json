      "abstract": "The presence of chloropropanols in edible oils is a significant food safety concern. Chloride in crude palm oil (CPO) is a precursor to the formation of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters (3-MCPDE) during refining; chloride retention during storage prior to refining remains under investigation. The study examined the impact of different washing treatments and storage duration on total chloride content (TCC), moisture and impurities (M&I), free fatty acid content (FFA), diacylglycerol (DAG), deterioration of bleachability index (DOBI), and iodine value (IV) of CPO. It was demonstrated that washing CPO with distilled water and 3% citric acid (DW+CA) resulted in the highest chloride reduction (37%) after one month of storage. A linear relationship was observed between TCC and FFA levels in the washed CPO, indicating that FFA is a strong predictor of chloride content. The DW+CA treatment also demonstrated a stabilizing effect on FFA levels, potentially mitigating oil deterioration during storage. These findings suggest that implementing DW+CA washing before CPO storage can effectively reduce chloride levels, enhancing the safety and quality of the oil and mitigating the risk of 3MCPDE formation during refining."

      "abstract": "Beef tallow is an important raw material in Chongqing hotpot seasoning but raises great concern on health due to the cholesterol issue. Herein, palm oil was expected to replace beef tallow at weight ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 without reducing hotpot flavor. The blending of palm oil to beef tallow effectively decreased cholesterol content to 33.20 mg 100 g-1, as well as the level of saturated fatty acids to 50 % in hotpot oil. The fading in brightness and yellowness of oil models occurred owing to heat treatment. The blending oil at 2:1 showed similar hardness, melting and crystallization behaviors to beef tallow, probably due to the similar fat crystal network. The volatile compounds of hotpot seasoning made from the oil were closer to that from neat beef tallow. These findings may provide a new strategy to develop healthier and tastier base oil for the production of Chongqing hotpot seasoning."

      "abstract": "Several studies have revealed that Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) adversely affects fish health systems in various ways. However, further studies on oxidative stress and histopathological changes in fish tissues exposed to POME are essential so that a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of its toxicity is attained. Subsequently, this study investigated oxidative stress indicators, including malondialdehyde (MDA) content and activities of antioxidant enzymes, as well as histological changes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) tissues after chronic exposure to POME. The results showed a significant increase in MDA content by up to 122 % in gills and 351 % in liver, while catalase (CAT) activity rose by 70 % in gills and 170 % in liver. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly reduced by 50 % in both tissues, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased by 162 % in the liver, yet showed no significant change in gills. Histological analysis revealed mild to severe alterations in gills (e.g., hyperplasia, hypertrophy, hemorrhage, and necrosis) and liver (e.g., hepatocyte shrinkage, congestion, hydropic degeneration, and necrosis) at higher POME concentrations and longer exposure durations. These findings suggest that oxidative stress markers and histopathological changes potentially serve as early warning indicators for: firstly, assessing POME contamination in aquatic environments; and secondly, evaluating the effectiveness of wastewater treatment systems.",

Chemical interesterification and adsorption treatments significantly improved oil quality and reduced ester levels (p < 0.05). Specifically, using 6% bleaching earth led to a 98.5% reduction in 3-MCPDE and a 98.3% reduction in GE. The type of bleaching earth did not significantly affect the reduction of these contaminants, while the amount of bleaching earth used played a crucial role in the mitigation.",

      "abstract": "Wastewater treatment has been regarded as an effective solution in lowering the potential environmental hazards caused by palm oil mill effluent (POME). To ensure the efficient remediation of POME, the implementation of a promising strategy is necessary to overcome the limitations of conventional water treatment methods for the treatment of this pollutant. In this study, the synthesis of carbon, nitrogen codoped titanium dioxide nanoparticles (C, N-TiO2 NPs) was successfully performed by a sol-gel approach for the treatment of POME as a model pollutant under solar light irradiation. The synthesized C, N-TiO2 NPs displayed unique characteristics including an anatase phase with an average crystallite size of 11.35 nm and irregular spherical structures. Additionally, C, N-TiO2 possessed a lower band gap energy of 2.95 eV than 3.2 V of bulk anatase TiO2 and slower electron-hole (e--h+) pair recombination rate as evidenced by photoluminescence (PL) studies. The adsorption isotherm study of POME was most compatible with the Langmuir isotherm model, and the POME degradation kinetics proceeded according to first-order kinetics. Accordingly, the photocatalytic degradation of POME displayed a maximum degradation efficiency of 100% under the optimum condition of pH 7 in the presence of 0.12 g of the C, N-TiO2 photocatalyst within 150 min. The scavenging study showed that the superoxide radical (•O2 -) was the primary active species in the POME photodegradation. Finally, the reusability analysis confirmed that the C, N-TiO2 NPs could be reused for a maximum of five cycles, making them promising photocatalysts for wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "The high content of vitamin E, including tocopherols and tocotrienols (TCF-TTE), in palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) has made it a promising candidate for the alternative treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the limited solubility of TCF-TTE has restricted its therapeutic efficacy. In this study, pluronic-based micelles (MCs) encapsulating palm oil-derived TCF-TTE were formulated with dissolvable microarray patch-micelles (DMP-MC) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) synthesized from empty fruit bunches of palm to optimize its delivery for AD. The MC was prepared using a direct dissolution method using Pluronic F68 and F127. The results showed that MC increased the solubility of TCF-TTE, which was further confirmed by an in vitro study where 90.23 ± 2.07% TCF and 4.56 ± 1.36% TTE were released compared to the unencapsulated TCF-TTE extract. Furthermore, CMC biopolymers and MC integrated into DMP-MC with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) exhibited favorable physical properties, such as mechanical strength and penetration ability. DMP-MC also exhibited a better platform with lower permeation, indicating higher retention and increased localized effects on AD skin than cream-MC. Additionally, dermatokinetic profile parameters showed significant improvement. The mean residence time (MRT) parameter indicated that TCF-TTE was retained for longer times 19.28 ± 0.02 h and 20.68 ± 0.01 h. Moreover, an in vivo study revealed that DMP-MC could relieve AD symptoms more rapidly than oral doses and cream-MC, indicating that DMP-MC proved to be more efficient. Furthermore, DMP-MC showed no tissue destruction (granulation and fibrosis) in rats treated with DMP-MC on the seventh day. Therefore, this study successfully developed the MC formula in DMP-MC formulation using synthesized CMC, which could potentially improve AD's therapeutic efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Palm oil, with its higher production, lower prices, and higher levels of palmitic acid and oleic acid, may have great potential for use in the aquafeed industry. In this study, with an 8-week feeding experiment, the efficacy of palm oil as a substitute for fish oil in tiger puffer feeds was comprehensively evaluated. The control diets (FO group) contained 8% marine fish oil as the main lipid source, while in the treatment diets, the added marine fish oil was replaced with palm oil at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, respectively, which was named 25PO, 50PO, 75PO, and 100PO, respectively. Juvenile tiger puffers with an initial weight of 15.0 ± 0.04 g were used, with three replicate tanks of 30 juvenile fish tiger puffer for each dietary group. The fish oil replacement by palm oil did not have an adverse effect on fish growth and feeding, but the weight gain decreased by 17.3% in group PO100. Palm oil had no significant effects on fish proximate composition and muscle texture. The effects of dietary palm oil on muscle fatty acid composition were not significant, with DHA and EPA significantly lowered only in the 100PO group. In contrast, the changes in liver and intestinal fatty acid compositions in response to diets were more significant than those in the muscle. In the intestine, the replacement of more than 50% fish oil by palm oil significantly downregulated the gene expression associated with peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation and triglyceride hydrolysis, while upregulated the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes. In the liver, the replacement of more than 75% fish oil also significantly upregulated the cholesterol synthesis. In conclusion, palm oil can replace 75% of added marine fish oil in tiger puffer diets and does not adversely affect the growth performance, feed utilization, muscle composition, and muscle texture."

Risk factors of CHD include, among others, hypercholesterolemia and elevations in systemic inflammation. Functional foods enriched with compounds showing cholesterol-lowering effects are considered one among various dietary and lifestyle intervention strategies to tackle this problem. A CHD-preventive effect of dietary plant sterols has been broadly discussed, not only due to their ability to reduce blood cholesterol level, but also to their proven anti-inflammatory potential. Palm oil is one of the most widely consumed edible oils in the world. Despite its widespread use, especially in Asian countries, no study has been conducted using palm oil as a vehicle for plant sterols. Methods: The aim of the placebo-controlled double-blinded trial presented here was, therefore, to evaluate the effect of palm oil enriched with plant sterols, used as a cooking oil, on lipid profile and systemic inflammation marker in 100 adult hyperlipidemic residents of Bogor, Indonesia. Results: The study has shown a significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol level in study subjects consuming plant sterol-enriched palm oil as a replacement for usual palm oil for cooking, with no similar effect on CRP levels. Conclusions: The study suggests that, along with a healthy diet and lifestyle promotion, incorporating plant sterols in palm oil used for cooking may be an effective strategy to reduce cardiovascular risks in hyperlipidemic individuals.",

A total of 150 Hisex Brown laying hens were randomly assigned to five treatments: a basal diet containing 4% CPO (T1-control) and basal diets in which CPO was substituted by 25% (T2), 50% (T3), 75% (T4) or 100% (T5) PPFO. These diets were fed to laying hens ad libitum for 16 weeks. Compared to the T1 diet, dietary treatments T2, T3 and T4 had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on the feed intake, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, egg number, egg production, egg weight and egg mass of the laying hens during the entire experimental period. Nonetheless, a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in feed intake, egg number, egg production and egg mass were observed in hens fed T5 compared to those fed the T1 (control) diet. Except for heart and spleen weights, other carcass characteristics were not affected by treatment (P < 0.05). Skin yellowness and breast meat redness increased significantly (linearly, P < 0.05) with increasing proportions of PPFO. Likewise, yolk colour scores increased in proportion to the dietary level of PPFO (linearly, P < 0.05). These findings suggest that PPFO can be used as a novel, cost-effective lipid source at a level of 3% in layer diets as a substitute for CPO to improve eggs' quality parameters without any harmful effects on laying performance.",

The nanoporous carbon (NPC) exhibited a maximum surface area of 1018 m2/g and it was utilized as a catalyst for the conversion of palm oil into green diesel fuel. The supported NPC catalyst was fabricated via a wet impregnation technique, where finely distributed iron phosphide (FeP) particles were cemented. The FeP/NPC catalyst was evaluated for its physicochemical characteristics using various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen sorption analyzer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping. An investigation was conducted to examine the effects of different temperatures (ranging from 280 to 360 °C) on the conversion of palm oil through deoxygenation reactions. The FeP/NPC catalyst exhibited remarkable particle dispersion and surface area. At a reaction temperature of 340 °C, the FeP/NPC catalyst had the best selectivity for green diesel, reaching 68.5%. The finding implies that FeP catalysts, when supported, hold significant promise for converting triglycerides into renewable diesel fuel. Moreover, they provide the advantage of being more cost-effective than valuable metals, while demonstrating excellent catalytic efficiency in the production of biofuels. Furthermore, it has been shown that the FeP/NPC catalyst can be recycled by subjecting it to heat treatment to remove impurities and obtain reduction."

The repeated treatment of POME by replacing pellets every 12 h enhanced the percent removal of color, phenolic compounds, and COD up to 90.97 ± 0.36 %, 70.71 ± 0.90 % and 56.55 ± 1.98 %, respectively. This study has demonstrated the promising potential for addressing dye removal and bioremediation of colored-industrial effluent in a sustainable and economically viable manner.",

      "abstract": "Menopause-associated mood disorder is characterized by emotional depression, anxiety, and stress, which accompany hypogonadism in women in the menopausal phase. The current treatment for menopause-associated mood disorder provides only symptomatic relief and is associated with many side effects. Supplementation with vitamin E has been shown to be effective in ameliorating anxiety and depression. However, the effects of vitamin E and its underlying mechanism in ameliorating menopause-associated mood disorders remain uncertain. This work evaluated the effects of α-tocopherol and tocotrienol-rich palm oil extract on depressive and anxiety-related phenotypes induced by estrogen deficiency through ovariectomy in mice. Our study revealed that ovariectomized mice exhibited alterations in behavior indicative of depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. The serum corticosterone level, a glucocorticoid hormone associated with stress, was found to be elevated in ovariectomized mice as compared to the sham group. Oral administration of α-tocopherol (50 and 100 mg/kg) and tocotrienol-rich palm oil extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) for 14 days alleviated these behavioral changes, as observed in open field, social interaction, and tail suspension tests. However, treatment with tocotrienol-rich palm oil extract, but not α-tocopherol, modulated the depressive- and anxiety-like responses in ovariectomized mice subjected to chronic restraint stress. Both treatments suppressed the elevated serum corticosterone level. Our findings suggested that α-tocopherol and tocotrienol-rich palm oil extract alleviated menopause-associated mood disorder, at least in part, by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The findings of this study can provide a new foundation for the treatment of menopause-associated depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes, for the betterment of psychological wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the effect of proanthocyanidin, palm oil and vitamin E against erosive and erosive+abrasive challenges in vitro after enamel pellicle formation in situ. METHODOLOGY: Bovine enamel blocks (n=84) were obtained and divided into the following treatment groups: negative control (NC) - deionized water; positive control (PC) - SnCl2/NaF/AmF-containing solution; palm oil (PO); 2% proanthocyanidin (P2); vitamin E (VitE); 2% proanthocyanidin+palm oil (P2PO); and 2% proanthocyanidin+vitamin E (P2VitE). For 5 days, one half of the sample from each group was subjected to erosion and the other half was subjected to erosion+abrasion. The acquired enamel pellicle (AEP) was pre-formed in situ for 30 minutes. The specimens were then treated in vitro with solutions (500 µl, 30s for each group). Subsequently, the blocks were left in the oral cavity for another hour to obtain the modified AEP. The blocks were immersed in 0.5% citric acid (pH=2.5) for 90s, 4×/day. AEP formation and treatment were carried out before the first and third erosive challenges, and after these challenges, abrasive cycles (15s) were performed on half of the samples. Enamel wear was quantified by profilometry and data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p<0.05). RESULTS: All groups showed higher wear when exposed to erosion+abrasion than when exposed to erosion alone (p=0.0001). PO, P2VitE, P2, and P2PO showed enamel wear similar to the PC group, but only PC, PO and P2VitE differed from the NC group. The other groups behaved similarly to NC. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the combination of proanthocyanidin and vitamin E was effective in reducing wear in the face of in vitro erosive and erosive+abrasive challenges.",

      "abstract": "Anaerobically-treated palm oil mill effluent (POME) still has unacceptable properties for water recycling and reuse, with an unpleasant appearance due to the brownish color caused by tannins and phenolic compounds. This study proposes an approach for treating anaerobically-treated POME for water recycling by combining organic precipitation, electrocoagulation (EC), and ion-exchange resin, followed by reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration in series. The results indicated that the organic precipitation enhanced the efficiency of EC treatment in reducing the concentrations of tannins, color, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the anaerobically-treated POME effluent, with reductions of 95.73%, 96.31%, and 93.96% for tannin, color, and COD, respectively. Moreover, organic precipitation affected the effectiveness of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ion removal using ion exchange resin and RO membrane filtration. Without prior organic precipitation, the ion-exchange resin process required a longer contact time, and the RO membrane filtration treatment was hardly effective in removing total dissolved solids (TDS). The combined process gave a water quality that meets the criteria set by the Thailand Ministry of Industry for industrial boiler use (COD 88 mg/L, TDS <0.001 mg/L, water hardness <5 mg-CaCO3/L, and pH 6.9).",

The MFC incorporated a tubular membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with an air core, featuring a carbon-painted carbon-cloth cathode, an anion exchange membrane (AEM), and a nonwoven graphite fabric (NWGF) anode. An additional carbon brush (CB) anode was placed adjacent to the tubular MEA. The MFC operated under semi-batch conditions with POME replacement every 7 days. Results showed superior performance of the AEM, with the highest power density (Pmax) observed in POME-treated MFCs. Current and power density increased with CB addition; the best chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency reached 73 %, decreasing from 1249 to 332 mg/L with three CBs. The Pmax was 0.18 W/m-2(-|-) with 1000 mg/L COD and three CBs, dropping to 0.0031 W/m-2(-|-) without CB and at 410 mg/L COD. Anode resistance, calculated using organic matter supplementation, COD, and anode surface area, decreased with increased COD or surface area, improving electricity production. AEM and CB compatibility synergistically enhanced MFC performance, offering potential for POME wastewater treatment and energy recovery.",

From day 3 of age, 30 female calves (39.4 ± 3.1 kg of body weight) were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments: (1) SF supplemented with 3.3% palm fatty acids (PO), (2) SF supplemented with 1.7% of PO and 1.9% fish oil (PFO), or (3) SF supplemented with 3.9% fish oil (FO). Chopped straw (7.5% of DM) was included in the SF of all treatments as total mixed ration (TMR). Diets had similar energy and protein contents. Total n-3 FA (% of total FA) and n-6/n-3 of PO, PFO, and FO were 1.90, 6.80, and 11.8 and 15.5, 4.50, and 2.70, respectively. The BW was greater for calves receiving FO (60.2 ± 0.3 kg) compared with PFO (58.7 ± 0.3 kg; p = 0.007) and tended to be greater for calves receiving FO vs. PO (59.0 ± 0.3 kg; p = 0.050). Because there was no interaction effect between diet × week of experiment, the greater BW of FO could not be attributed to the dietary treatment. Accordingly, average daily gain, total dry matter intake (DMI), starter DMI, and gain to intake ratio (G:FI) did not differ among dietary treatments during the entire period of the study (p > 0.05). Dietary treatments did not impact body size parameters such as body length, body girth, withers height, heart girth, hip height, and width (p > 0.05). Neither ruminal fermentation parameters nor blood variables were influenced by supplementing the types of oil at different time points. Calves' behavioral parameters, such as standing, lying, eating, and ruminating, were not influenced by different dietary treatments (p > 0.05). The number of days with abnormal fecal score was not different among dietary groups (p > 0.05). Overall, our findings suggest that changing the n-6/n-3 ratio in starter feed by incremental replacement of palm fatty acid with fish oil at a moderate supplemental level of ~3% of DM may not affect the growth and metabolic performance of young calves under non-challenged conditions."

In this study, microwave pyrolysis of CSW using self-purging, vacuum, and steam activation techniques was examined to determine the biochar production yield and its performance in treating palm oil mill effluent (POME). The biochar produced through microwave pyrolysis exhibits yields ranging from 50 to 61 wt%, showing a hard texture, low volatile matter content (≤34.1 wt%), and high fixed carbon content (≥58.3 wt%). The KOH-activated biochar demonstrated a surface area of up to 177 m2/g that is predominantly composed of mesopores, providing a good amount of adsorption sites for use as adsorbent. The biochar activated with steam removed 8.3 mg/g of BOD and 42 mg/g of COD from POME. The results demonstrate that microwave pyrolysis of CSW is a promising technology to produce high-quality biochar as an adsorbent for POME treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During recent years several studies have investigated the impact of different dietary oils on body weight. They have shown differential positive and negative effects on anthropometry. We investigated the effects of palm and coconut oils on body weight and other anthropometric parameters, considering their importance as a primary source of saturated fat, controlling for other confounding variable such as total energy intake. METHODS: The study was conducted as a sequential feeding clinical trial with 40 healthy men and women divided into two feeding periods of initial palm oil (8 weeks) and subsequent coconut oil (8 weeks), with a 16-week washout period in between. Each participant received a pre-determined volume of each oil, which were integrated into their routine main meals and snacks during the respective study periods. Changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were evaluated. Physical activity levels and dietary intake were also evaluated as potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants completed both oil treatment periods. The mean (± SD) age of the participants was 39 (± 13.1) years. There were no significant differences in any of the anthropometric parameters between the initial point of feeding coconut oil and the initial point of feeding palm oil. Following both oil treatment phases, no significant changes in the subjects' body weight, BMI, or other anthropometric measurements (WC, HC, and WHR) were observed. CONCLUSION: Neither coconut oil nor palm oil significantly changed anthropometry-related cardiovascular risk factors such as body weight, BMI, WC, HC, and WHR.

      "abstract": "To replace the obsolete ponding system, palm oil mill effluent (POME) steam reforming (SR) over net-acidic LaNiO3 and net-basic LaCoO3 were proposed as the POME primary treatments, with promising H2-rich syngas production. Herein, the long-term evaluation of POME SR was scrutinized with both catalysts under the optimal conditions (600 °C, 0.09 mL POME/min, 0.3 g catalyst, & 74-105 μm catalyst particle size) to examine the catalyst microstructure changes, transient process stability, and final effluent evaluation. Extensive characterization proved the (i) adsorption of POME vapour on catalysts before SR, (ii) deposition of carbon and minerals on spent SR catalysts, and (iii) dominance of coking deactivation over sintering deactivation at 600 °C. Despite its longer run, spent LaCoO3 (50.54 wt%) had similar carbon deposition with spent LaNiO3 (50.44 wt%), concurring with its excellent coke resistance. Spent LaCoO3 (6.12 wt%; large protruding crystals) suffered a harsher mineral deposition than spent LaNiO3 (3.71 wt%; thin film coating), confirming that lower reactivity increased residence time of reactants. Transient syngas evolution of both SR catalysts was relatively steady up to 4 h but perturbed by coking deactivation thereafter. La2O2CO3 acted as an intermediate species that hastened the coke removal via reverse Boudouard reaction upon its decarbonation. La2O2CO3 decarbonation occurred continuously in LaCoO3 system but intermittently in LaNiO3 system. LaNiO3 system only lasted for 13 h as its compact ash blocked the gas flow. LaCoO3 system lasted longer (17 h) with its porous ash, but it eventually failed because KCl crystallites blocked its active sites. Relatively, LaCoO3 system offered greater net H2 production (72.78%) and POME treatment volume (30.77%) than LaNiO3 system. SR could attain appreciable POME degradation (>97% COD, BOD5, TSS, & colour intensity). Withal, SR-treated POME should be polished to further reduce its incompliant COD and BOD5.",

      "abstract": "Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is regarded as deleterious to the environment, primarily owing to the substantial volume of waste it produces during palm oil extraction. In terms of contaminant composition, POME surpasses the pollutant content typically found in standard municipal sewage, therefore releasing it without treatment into water bodies would do irreparable damage to the environment. Main palm oil mills are normally located in the proximity of natural rivers in order to take advantage of the cheap and abundant water source. The same rivers are also used as a water source for many villages situated along the river banks. As such, it is imperative to degrade POME before its disposal into the water bodies for obvious reasons. The treatment methods used so far include the biological processes such as open ponding/land application, which consist of aerobic as well as anaerobic ponds, physicochemical treatment including membrane technology, adsorption and coagulation are successful for the mitigation of contaminants. As the above methods require large working area and it takes more time for contaminant degradation, and in consideration of the strict environmental policies as well as palm oil being the most sort of vegetable oil in several countries, numerous researchers have concentrated on the emerging technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to remediate POME. Methods such as the photocatalysis, Fenton process, sonocatalysis, sonophotocatalysis, ozonation have attained special importance for the degradation of POME because of their efficiency in complete mineralization of organic pollutants in situ. This review outlines the AOP technologies currently available for the mineralization of POME with importance given to sonophotocatalysis and ozonation as these treatment process removes the need to transfer the pollutant while possibly degrading the organic matter sufficiently to be used in other industry like fertilizer manufacturing.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the effectiveness of integrating electrocoagulation (EC) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes for palm oil mill effluent (POME) wastewater treatment was investigated. The impact of various parameters on contaminant removal efficiency, including electrode configuration (monopolar and bipolar), number of anodes, agitation rate, and current density, was studied. The findings demonstrated that using bipolar (BP) electrodes in the EC reactor improved coagulation efficiency. However, an increase in agitation rate led to a decrease in removal efficiency. The electrode configuration of 2A-2C-2B achieved high contaminant removal with a lower electrode consumption compared to the 4A-2C and 4A-2C-2B configurations. The removal efficiencies for total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were 59.1%, 99.9%, 96.8%, and 96%, respectively. The operating cost for the electrode configuration of 2A-2C-2B was estimated to be 2.71 US$ m-3 at an effluent capacity of 50 m3 d-1 and 20 h d-1 of operating time, while the energy requirement was 6.20 kWh m-3. An increase in operating time from 5 to 24 h d-1 raised the specific operating cost from 2.17 to 2.85 US$ m-3. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing EC and UF processes for POME wastewater treatment, which could have significant implications for sustainable industrial practices.",

      "abstract": "Residual oil from palm oil mill effluent (POME) can be valorized into value-added products like biofuel. However, the complex structure in POME limits the full recovery of intracellular lipids. To address this challenge, low-frequency ultrasonication was used as a pre-treatment prior to oil recovery to improve the yield by liberating the entrapped oil via the cell disruption technique. This study focused on optimizing the ultrasound conditions (i.e., ultrasonication amplitude, ultrasonication duration, and probe immersion depth) to maximize the improvement of oil recovery yield using response surface methodology. The optimized conditions were 30.074% ultrasonication amplitude, 0.167 min ultrasonication duration, and 2 cm probe immersion depth. This resulted in an additional 42.50% improvement in oil recovery yield over non-ultrasonicated POME, which is in close agreement with the model prediction. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis was incorporated to determine the feasibility of ultrasonication for enhancing oil recovery. The study also explored the synthesis of biodiesel from POME-recovered oil and characterized the fuel attributes according to American Society for Testing and Materials- and European Standards-prescribed procedures. The attributes of biodiesel produced from POME-recovered oil are comparable to those of palm-based biodiesel in Malaysia, demonstrating its potential as an alternative source for biodiesel production.",

The stormwater samples underwent filtration and were preserved in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles at a temperature of 4 °C for use as incoming water. The outgoing water, referred to as effluent, was obtained from tests performed on pervious concrete samples after a curing period of 28 days. The pervious concrete mixes were created with a water-to-binder ratio (w/b ratio) of 32% and a sand ratio of 10%. Three different levels of palm oil kernel shell and seashell content were used as coarse aggregate replacements: 0%, 25%, and 50%. Two single-size group were considered for both palm oil kernel shell and seashell: (6.3-9.5 mm) and (4.75-6.3 mm). Heavy metal analyses were conducted on the influent and effluent using a PerkinElmer ELAN 6100 Series Inductively Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).

However, the role of SREBP2 in teleost remains poorly understand. Here, we explored the molecular characterisation of SREBP2 and identified SREBP2 as a key modulator for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which were rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis. Moreover, dietary palm oil in vivo or palmitic acid (PA) treatment in vitro elevated cholesterol content through triggering SREBP2-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis in large yellow croaker. Furthermore, our results also found that PA-induced activation of SREBP2 was dependent on the stimulating of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in croaker myocytes and inhibition of ERS by 4-Phenylbutyric acid alleviated PA-induced SREBP2 activation and cholesterol biosynthesis. In summary, our findings reveal a novel insight for understanding the role of SREBP2 in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in fish and may deepen the link between dietary fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis.",

      "abstract": "Attributable to the prosperous production growth of palm oil in Malaysia, the generated palm oil mill effluent (POME) poses a high threat owing to its highly polluted characteristic. Urged by the escalating concern of environmental conservation, POME pollution abatement and potential energy recovery from the effluent are flagged up as a research topic of interest. In this study, a cutting-edge photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) system with employment of ZnO/Zn nanorod array (NRA) photoanode, CuO/Cu cathode, and persulfate (PS) oxidant was successfully designed to improve the treatment of POME and simultaneous energy production. The photoelectrodes were fabricated and characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller analysis (BET). Owing to the properties of strong oxidant of PS, the proposed PFC/PS system has exhibited exceptional performance, attaining chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 96.2%, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 740.0 mV, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 146.7 μA cm-2, and power density (Pmax) of 35.6 μW cm-2. The pre-eminent PFC/PS system performance was yielded under optimal conditions of 2.5 mM of persulfate oxidant, POME dilution factor of 1:20, and natural solution pH of 8.51. Subsequently, the postulated photoelectrocatalytic POME treatment mechanism was elucidated by the radical scavenging study and Mott-Schottky (M-S) analysis. The following recycling test affirmed the stability and durability of the photoanode after four continuous repetition usages while the assessed electrical energy efficiency revealed the economic viability of PFC system serving as a post-treatment for abatement of POME. These findings contributed toward enhancing the sustainability criteria and economic viability of palm oil by adopting sustainable and efficient POME post-treatment technology.",

A modified wet chemical process was used to prepare BTiO2. The BTiO2 was then wet impregnated with Mn and calcined at 300 °C for 1 h to produce Mn/BTiO2. The activity of Mn/BTiO2 was investigated in terms of photo-assisted elimination of chemical oxygen demand (COD), phenolic compounds (PCs), color, and total organic carbon (TOC). Using the design of experiments (DOE), the conditions of the photocatalytic process, including photocatalyst loading, Mn concentration, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dose, and irradiation time, were optimized. Under the optimum conditions (0.85 g/L photocatalyst loading, 0.048 mol/L H2O2 dose, 0.301 wt.% Mn concentration, and 204 min irradiation time) COD, PCs, color, and TOC removal efficiencies of 88.87%, 86.04%, 62.8%, and 84.66%, respectively, were obtained. Statistical analysis showed that the response variable's removal from TPOME estimation had high R2 and low RMSE, MSE, MAD, MAE, and MAPE values, indicating high reliability. This study demonstrated the significant potential of the developed photocatalytic system for the treatment of waste effluent generated by the palm oil industry and other agro-industries, with the ability to simultaneously reduce a number of organic pollution indicators (OPIs).",

This study investigates the function of beta-carotene (PBC) originating from palm oil mill effluent in the treatment of diabetes in mice. An intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) was used to induce diabetes, which was then accelerated by an intravitreal (i.vit.) injection of STZ (20 µL on day 7). PBC (50 and 100 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (DEX: 10 mg/kg) were also administered orally (p.o.) for 21 days. At various time intervals, the optomotor response (OMR) and visual-cue function test (VCFT) responses were evaluated. Biomarkers, such as reduced glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs), and catalase activity were determined in retinal tissue samples. DR significantly lowers the spatial frequency threshold (SFT) and time spent in the target quadrant (TSTQ), increases the reaching time in the visual-cue platform (RVCP), lowers retinal GSH and catalase activity levels, and elevates TBARS levels. The treatments of PBC and DEX also ameliorate STZ-induced DR alterations. The potential ameliorative activity of PBC in DR is attributed to its anti-diabetic, anti-oxidative, and control of blood-retinal barrier layer properties."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the effect of the addition of rumen-protected palm oil making up 3% of the ration on lipid health indices and milk fatty acid composition of Kivircik ewes'. Kivircik ewes at two years of age, the same parity, lactation stage, and the same bodyweight (52.57 ± 5.80 kg) were chosen for this purpose. Two groups were formed, in which the control group was fed a basal diet without feed supplementation, whereas the treatment group received rumen-protected palm oil which corresponded to 3% of the ration. In order to protect palm oil, it was coated with calcium salts. Treatment increased the palmitic acid (C16:0) content of milk compared to the control group (P < 0.05) and tended to increase saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (P = 0.14). An increase in SFA and MUFA was attributed to an increase in palmitic acid and oleic acid (C18:1), respectively (P < 0.05). Results indicated that the omega-6/omega-3 ratio (n-6/n-3) ranged between 0.61 and 2.63. The inclusion of palm oil in the diet tended to increase desirable fatty acids (DFAs) regardless of the week of milk sampled (P = 0.42). Treatment did not improve the atherogenicity index (AI), thrombogenicity index (TI), health-promoting index (HPI), and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic (h/H) ratio. Results showed that adding rumen-protected palm oil is a plausible method to meet the energy intake of ewes required during lactation without negatively affecting lipid health indices.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The lower rates of cardiovascular disease in Southern Europe could be partially explained by the low prevalence of lipid-rich atheroma plaques. Consumption of certain foods affects the progression and severity of atherosclerosis. We investigated whether the isocaloric inclusion of walnuts within an atherogenic diet prevents phenotypes predicting unstable atheroma plaque in a mouse model of accelerated atherosclerosis. METHODS: Apolipoprotein E-deficient male mice (10-week-old) were randomized to receive a control diet (9.6% of energy as fat, n = 14), a palm oil-based high-fat diet (43% of energy as fat, n = 15), or an isocaloric diet in which part of palm oil was replaced by walnuts in a dose equivalent to 30 g/day in humans (n = 14). All diets contained 0.2% cholesterol. RESULTS: After 15 weeks of intervention, there were no differences in size and extension in aortic atherosclerosis among groups. Compared to control diet, palm oil-diet induced features predicting unstable atheroma plaque (higher lipid content, necrosis, and calcification), and more advanced lesions (Stary score). Walnut inclusion attenuated these features. Palm oil-based diet also boosted inflammatory aortic storm (increased expression of chemokines, cytokines, inflammasome components, and M1 macrophage phenotype markers) and promoted defective efferocytosis. Such response was not observed in the walnut group. The walnut group's differential activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB; downregulated) and Nrf2 (upregulated) in the atherosclerotic lesion could explain these findings. CONCLUSION: The isocaloric inclusion of walnuts in an unhealthy high-fat diet promotes traits predicting stable advanced atheroma plaque in mid-life mice. This contributes novel evidence for the benefits of walnuts, even in an unhealthy dietary environment."

      "abstract": "In recent years, China is increasingly dependent on imported wood. Afrormosia and Newtonia are some of the imported species with good utilization potential. However, both of them also have problems with poor dimensional stability. In order to make better use of these two types of wood, the influence of heat treatment under air and palm oil conditions on the color, dimensional stability, and hygroscopicity of Afrormosia and Newtonia was investigated. The Afrormosia and Newtonia wood samples were heated in air or palm oil medium for two hours at 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Then, the color, weight changes, swelling, moisture absorption and chemical structure were evaluated for each case. As results, the heat treatments with air or palm oil increased the dark color of Newtonia and Afrormosia wood and this increase was proportional to the treatment temperature. The tangential and radial swelling coefficient for air heat treatment of Afrormosia wood at 200 °C were, respectively, reduced by 24.59% and 19.58%, while this reduction for Newtonia was 21.32% and 14.80%. The heat treatment in palm oil further improved the stability and hygroscopicity of the wood, showing that the Afrormosia samples treated by palm oil at 200 °C underwent a decrease of its tangential and radial swelling coefficient, respectively, by 49.34% and 45.88%, whereas the tangential and radial swelling coefficient of Newtonia treated under the same conditions were reduced by 42.85% and 33.63%, respectively. The heat treatments of Afrormosia and Newtonia samples under air at 200 °C diminished the water absorption by 21.67% and 22.12%. The water absorption of Afrormosia and Newtonia heat-treated under palm oil at 200 °C was reduced, respectively, by 39.40% and 37.49%. Moreover, the FTIR analysis showed the decrease of hydroxyl groups in proportion to the wood treatment temperature."

The mutant strain Azotobacter vinelandii ΔAvin_16040, which lacks the S-layer protein but has a better P(3HB) synthesis capability than the wild type strain ATCC 12,837, was chosen for this study. UrPOME substrate, with high biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and suspended solids, was used without pre-treatment. DSMZ-Azotobacter medium which was devoid of laboratory sugar(s) was used as the basal medium (BaM). Initially, Azotobacter vinelandii ΔAvin_16040 generated 325.5, 1496.3, and 1465.7 mg L-1 of P(3HB) from BaM with 20% urPOME, 2BaM with 20% urPOME and 20 g L-1 sucrose, and 2BaM with 20% urPOME and 2 mL L-1 glycerol, respectively. P(3HB) generation was enhanced by nearly tenfold using statistical optimization, resulting in 13.9 g L-1. Moreover, the optimization reduced the compositions of mineral salts and sugar in the medium by 48 and 97%, respectively. The urPOME-based P(3HB) product developed a yellow coloration most possibly attributed to the aromatic phenolics content in urPOME. Despite the fact that both were synthesised by ΔAvin_16040, thin films of urPOME-based P(3HB) had superior crystallinity and tensile strength than P(3HB) produced only on sucrose. When treated with 10 and 50 kGy of electron beam irradiation, these P(3HB) scissioned to half and one-tenth of their original molecular weights, respectively, and these cleavaged products could serve as useful base units for specific polymer structure construction.",

Moreover, using Egger's test, JAMOVI 1.6.23 software was used to analyze random effects models with 95% confidence intervals and publication bias. The results showed that palm oil waste was optimally treated by composting, which is considered as a sustainable technology for protecting the environment, human safety, and economic value. The in-vessel method with a controlled composting chamber is the best system with a minimum time of 14 days. However, it requires tight control and provides a final product with a high microbial colony form outdoors and indoors compared to the windrow system. This study is useful to see the bias of research results and helps to find new studies that need to be developed, especially in this case related to the management of palm oil waste into organic compost fertilizer and its application methods in the field. It is suggested that applying palm oil waste or compost is mainly performed by mulching. In contrast, new challenges for better processing to produce organic fertilizers and applicable technologies for sustainable waste management are recommended. The method must be affordable, efficient, and practical, combining compost quality with maximum nutrient recovery.",

      "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VaD) is a serious global health issue and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at higher risk. Palm oil tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) exhibits neuroprotective properties; however, its effect on VaD is not reported. Hence, we evaluated TRF effectiveness in T2DM-induced VaD rats. Rats were given a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NA) to develop T2DM. Seven days later, diabetic rats were given TRF doses of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg orally for 21 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed for memory assessment. Biochemical parameters such as blood glucose, plasma homocysteine (HCY) level, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) level, and histopathological changes in brain hippocampus and immunohistochemistry for platelet-derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) expression were evaluated. VaD rats had significantly reduced memory, higher plasma HCY, increased AChE activity, and decreased GSH and SOD levels. However, treatment with TRF significantly attenuated the biochemical parameters and prevented memory loss. Moreover, histopathological changes were attenuated and there was increased PDGF-C expression in the hippocampus of VaD rats treated with TRF, indicating neuroprotective action. In conclusion, this research paves the way for future studies and benefits in understanding the potential effects of TRF in VaD rats.",

In this study, electrochemical oxidation (EO) by a ruthenium oxide-coated titanium (Ti/RuO2) electrode was introduced as a pre-treatment for POME waste activated sludge (WAS). Surface morphology and elemental analysis were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. Response surface methodology type central composite design was used in this study to understand the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to validate the model of the studied variables. The correlation coefficients (R2) indicated a close agreement between the experimental results and the predicted values, with high R2 values of 0.9044-0.9773. Multiple response optimization suggested that the range of current density (17-27 mA/cm2) and electrolysis time (55-75 min) at a fixed concentration of sodium chloride (10 g/L), resulted in mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) removal >20%, capillary suction timer (CST) reduction >43%, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) increment <19% and soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) increment >25%.

      "abstract": "The presence of metal with microwave irradiation has always invited controversial arguments as the metal will catch on fire easily. But interestingly, researchers found that arc discharge phenomena provide a promising way for molecule cracking to synthesize nanomaterials. This study developed a single-step yet affordable synthesis approach that combines microwave heating and arcing in transforming crude palm oil into magnetic nanocarbon (MNC), which can be considered a new alternative for the palm oil sectors. It involves synthesizing the medium at a partial inert condition with constant coiled stainless steel metal wire (dielectric media) and ferrocene (catalyst). This approach successfully demonstrates heating at a temperature ranging from 190.9 to 472.0 °C with different synthesis times (10-20 min). The produced MNC shows formations of spheres with average sizes of 20.38-31.04 nm, mesoporous structure (SBET: 14.83-151.95 m2/g), and high content of fixed carbon (52.79-71.24wt%), and the ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) is 0.98-0.99. The formation of new peaks in the FTIR spectra (522.29-588.48 cm-1) supports the appearance of the FeO compounds from the ferrocene. The magnetometer shows high magnetization saturation (22.32-26.84 emu/g) in ferromagnetic materials. The application of the MNC in wastewater treatment has been demonstrated by evaluating their adsorbent capability with Methylene Blue (MB) adsorption test at a different concentrations varying between 5 and 20 ppm. The MNC produced at synthesis time (20 min) shows the highest adsorption efficiency (10.36 mg/g) compared to others, with 87.79% removal of MB dye. As a result, the value for Langmuir is not promising compared to Freundlich, with R2 being around 0.80, 0.98, and 0.99 for MNC synthesized at 10 min (MNC10), 15 min (MNC15), and 20 min (MNC20), respectively. Hence, the adsorption system is in a heterogeneous condition. The microwave-assisted arcing thereby presents a promising approach to transforming CPO into MNC that could remove the hazardous dye.",

      "abstract": "Traditional grass cloth has been used in China for a long time for the manufacturing of various household furnishing textiles and ladieswear. However, traditionally the grass cloth is dyed with reactive dyes in an aqueous medium, but the dyeing process is not sustainable because of high energy and water usage and the production of coloured effluent. In this work, the possibility of palm oil/water dual-phase dyeing of traditional grass cloth with a reactive dye, C.I. Reactive Blue 194 (Reactive Blue 194), was explored. The grass cloth soaked in an alkaline solution with 80-140% pick-up was dyed in a palm oil dyebath containing dye powder dispersed in a palm oil medium. The initial study confirmed that the pre-treatment of the fabric with an alkaline solution with 140% pick-up was beneficial for the uniform distribution of the dye in the fibres. The dyeing process parameters (e.g., fixation temperature, solution pH, and fixation time) for the grass cloth dyeing with the Reactive Blue 194 were optimised by using the Taguchi method. The pH of the alkali pre-treatment solution was found to be the most influential factor, as confirmed by the analysis of variance in terms of the percentage of contribution (94.41%), which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The confirmation tests were carried out under optimal settings, and a higher K/S (24.06) was found compared with the initial condition (21.51). X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the dyeing process did not affect the crystallinity of the grass cloth fibres. Furthermore, the recovery of palm oil from the spent dyebath was around 99%, and up to five times recycling and reuse of palm oil were studied for the dyeing of grass cloth. The colour strength of the grass cloths dyed in the palm oil recycled up to five times was similar to the cloth dyed in fresh palm oil. The results show that palm oil can be used as a dyeing medium for the sustainable dyeing of grass cloth with effluent reduction, which can be extended to the dyeing of other textile fibres."

POME and EFB are available abundantly in Malaysia and only small portion is utilized to produce other value-added products. The objective of this study is to: (1) utilize the wastes from agro-industrial sector especially palm oil wastes and bio-valorize into value-added product of biomass fuel with high CEV, and simultaneously (2) reduce the waste accumulated in the palm oil factory. In this study, co-fermentation of bacteria (Lysinibacillus sp.) and fungus (Aspergillus flavus) at 37 °C, 180 rpm for 5 days, followed by overnight oven-dry at 85 °C was conducted utilizing a mixture of POME and EFB with the ratio of 7:3 at laboratory scale. Three fermentation medium conditions were performed, namely: (1) Group 1: autoclaved POME and EFB without addition of any microorganisms, (2) Group 2: autoclaved POME and EFB with the addition of Lysinibacillus sp. LC 556247 and Aspergillus flavus, and (3) Group 3: POME and EFB as it is (non-sterile). Among all condition, Group 2 with co-fermentation evinced the highest calorific energy value (CEV) of 26.71 MJ/kg, highest biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal efficiency of 61.11%, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency at 48.47%, and total suspended solid (TSS) reduction of 37.12%. Overall, this study successfully utilized abundant POME and EFB waste and turn into value added product of renewable biomass fuel with high CEV percentage and simultaneously able to reduce abundant liquid waste."

      "abstract": "A metabolic disease called hypercholesterolemia is connected to both oxidative damage and inflammation. The goal of the current investigation was to determine if olive oil and palm oil could prevent hypercholesterolemia-induced oxidative stress in the liver of rats fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD). The experimental mice were given HCD for three months while also receiving 0.5 mL/kg of either palm or olive oil. Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, vLDL cholesterol, and the atherogenic index all significantly increased in HCD-fed rats, while HDL cholesterol significantly dropped. Additionally, HCD caused a notable rise in proinflammatory cytokines and serum transaminases in liver tissue. Additionally, HCD significantly increased the production of nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation in the liver while decreasing antioxidant enzymes. Treatment with palm and olive oils dramatically reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid peroxidation, improved antioxidant defenses, and considerably improved liver function indicators. Additionally, the examined oils dramatically decreased the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the liver of rats receiving HCD. In conclusion, HCD-fed rats exhibit significant antihyperlipidemic and cholesterol-lowering benefits from palm and olive oils. The improved antioxidant defenses, lower inflammation and lipid peroxidation, and altered hepatic FAS mRNA expression were the main mechanisms by which palm and olive oils produced their advantageous effects."

Red palm oil (RPO) is a unique natural product with a balanced ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, with reported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we assess the protective effect and mechanistic action of RPO using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hepatic injury model. Male Wistar rats were assigned into four groups (10 animals/group): normal control (NC), RPO, LPS and RPO + LPS. Animals in the RPO and RPO + LPS groups were administered RPO (200 μL/day) for 28 days. On the 27th day of experiment, animals in LPS and RPO + LPS groups were injected with LPS (0.5 mg/kg body weight). Animals were sacrificed 24 h later, and blood and liver tissues harvested for biochemical and molecular analysis. RPO resolved hepatic histological dysfunction induced by LPS, and lowered alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transferase activities in the serum. Hepatic malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and TNFα were significantly diminished (p < 0.05) by RPO pre-treatment. Activity of hepatic antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, as well as glutathione redox status (GSH:GSSG), and markers of antioxidant capacity that decreased as a result of LPS injection were improved by RPO pre-treatment. Mechanistically, RPO up-regulated mRNA expression of redox sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 and its downstream targets GCL and HO-1, while also suppressing the expression of NFκβ and associated inflammatory protein, Iκβ kinase (IκKβ). In conclusion, this study highlights the ameliorating effects of RPO against LPS-induced hepatic injury and revealed the Nrf2/GCL/HO-1 and NFκβ signaling axis as potential contributing mechanisms."

      "abstract": "Biological hydrogen production using palm oil mill effluent (POME) as a carbon source through dark fermentation process has been suggested to be a promising bioenergy potential and enacts as alternative renewable energy source. Results have indicated that among various 1.5% (w/v) chemical pre-treatments (sodium hydroxide, NaOH; hydrochloric acid, HCl; sulphuric acid, H2SO4; phosphoric acid, H3PO4 and nitric acid, HNO3) on POME, using H3PO4 would generate maximum biohydrogen production of 0.193 mmol/L/h, which corresponded to a yield of 1.51 mol H2/mol TCconsumed with an initial total soluble carbohydrate concentration of 23.52 g/L. Among H3PO4 concentrations (1%-10%), the soluble carbohydrate content and the biohydrogen produced was highest and increased by 1.70-fold and 2.35-fold respectively at 2.5% (w/v), as compared to untreated POME. The batch fermentation maximum hydrogen production rate and yield of 0.208 mmol/L/h and 1.69 mol H2/mol TCconsumed were achieved at optimum pre-treatment conditions of pH 5.5 and thermophilic temperature (60 °C). This study suggests that chemical pre-treatment approaches manage to produce and improve the carbohydrate utilisation process further. Continuous fermentation in CSTR at the optimum conditions produce heightened 1.5-fold biohydrogen yield for 2.5% H3PO4 at 6 h HRT as compared to batch scale. Bacterial community via next-generation sequencing analysis at optimum HRT (6 h) revealed that Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum registered the highest relative frequency of 20.24%. At the class level, Clostridia, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, Thermoanaerobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria were identified as the biohydrogen-producing bacteria in the continuous system.

Current research focuses on how the microbiota and organic components interact during the degradation of this type of waste. Some recent studies have described the microbial communities present in different biodegradation processes of palm oil mill waste, identifying the dominant bacteria/fungi responsible for breaking down the cellulosic components. However, understanding the degradation process's mechanisms is vital to eliminating the need for further pretreatment of lignocellulosic compounds in the waste mixture and facilitating the commercialization of palm oil mill waste treatment technology. Thus, the present work aims to review microbial community dynamics via three biological treatment systems comprehensively: composting, vermicomposting, and dark fermentation, to understand how inspiration from nature can further enhance existing degradation processes. The information presented could be used as an umbrella to current research on biological treatment processes and specific research on the bioaugmentation of indigenous microbial consortia isolated during the biological degradation of palm oil mill waste.",

      "abstract": "Palm oil is the most utilized vegetable globally which is mostly produced in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The great amount of POME generation from palm oil mills is now a threat to the environment and require a suitable treatment of POME to reduce the organic strength in accordance with the standard discharge limit before releasing to the environment. Currently, the technology to combine the anaerobic process and biofilm system in bioreactors have produced a fresh idea in treatments of high strength wastewater like POME. Anaerobic biofilm reactor is a convincing method for POME treatment due to its significant advantages over the conventional biological treatments consisting of anaerobic, aerobic and facultative pond systems. Overall, integrated anaerobic-aerobic bioreactor (IAAB) can remove more than 99% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) with the combination of anaerobic and aerobic digestion for POME treatment. It has better performance as compared to up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and up-flow anaerobic filter (UAF) with 80% and 88-94% COD removal efficiency respectively. Anaerobic pond was found to perform well also by removing 97.8% of COD in POME but require long retention time and larger land. Hence, this study aims to provide intensive review of the performance of the anaerobic biofilm reactor in treating POME and the recent advancements in this technology. The limitations and future perspectives in utilization of anaerobic biofilm reactor during its operation in treating POME are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Food products are often subject to information asymmetries, which are commonly supposed to be reduced by labels and certifications. However, as the number of labels increases, consumers tend to get confused, bored or impatient and stop using them to make product choices. This study uses data from a discrete choice experiment, conducted in Germany, to analyze consumers' preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sustainability indicators on products that contain palm oil as an ingredient. Since information is crucial to the assessment and awareness of, or attendance to, labels on consumer products, this study assesses the effect of factual information on preferences as well as attribute-processing strategies. We use a hybrid latent variable model that allows us to jointly examine the response to the stated choice component and the responses to attribute processing questions, thus capturing attribute non-attendance (ANA) to specific labels while controlling for heterogenous preferences. Our results reveal that the attribute 'organic' receives the highest monetary valuation in the overall sample as well as in the information intervention, and the no-information intervention groups. The results also show that providing additional information tends to change consumers' non-attendance patterns as well as WTP values. In particular, the information intervention tends to increase consumers' WTP and decreases their ANA for sustainability-indicating attributes. The findings suggest that the attribute 'organic' has the potential to be ranked highest across the entire latent variable structure, making it the most promising attribute for promoting sustainable palm oil use across consumer groups.",

Steers were blocked by BW and gain to feed (G:F) and randomly assigned to individual feedlot pens. Treatments (2 × 2 factorial) consisted of ad libitum-fed steers without (ANF) or with (AWF) the inclusion of CPO or restricted-fed steers (85% of the ad libitum intake of ANF) without (RNF) or with the inclusion of CPO (RWF). After weaning, steers were adapted to individual pens and fed a corn silage-based diet for 30 d and subsequently placed in a ground corn (GC)-based diet. Diets were given ad libitum or at 85% of the ANF intake and with or without CPO. After 59 d on the finishing diet, all steers had ad libitum access to the finishing diet until harvest. Measurements of CO2 emission and O2 consumption to estimate respiratory quotient (RQ) were taken (n = 9/treatment). Correlations between plasma GIP and insulin concentrations and RQ were analyzed. A linear regression was performed to evaluate the association of plasma GIP and MS. All data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS. During the first 103 d of the trial, there were AFO × CPO interactions (P ≤ 0.01) for BW, dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), and net energy for maintenance (NEm) intake. Ad libitum-fed steers without CPO presented the greatest DMI among dietary treatments and had greater BW and ADG compared with steers in the RWF and RNF treatments. After all steers had ad libitum access to dietary treatments, steers that were previously restricted showed a 30% and 19% increase (P ≤ 0.01) in ADG and G:F, respectively. There was a three-way interaction time × CPO × AFO (P = 0.04) for plasma GIP concentration. There was no correlation (P = 0.96) of GIP with RQ, whereas insulin demonstrated marginal significance for a positive (P = 0.07) and negative (P = 0.08) correlation with plasma GIP and RQ, respectively. There was no association (P = 0.30) between GIP and MS. These data indicate that GIP secretion results from an interaction between CPO and energy intake depending on the time relative to feed intake that GIP might indirectly regulate energy metabolism through insulin secretion, and that GIP does not appear to be associated with MS.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the inclusion of chromium propionate or calcium salts of palm oil in ewes' diet during the final third of gestation and lactation on progeny performance, carcass characteristics, non-carcass components, and bone density. Forty-three ewe, Santa Inês and Dorper breed, three ± one-year-old, and body weight 57 ± 10 kg were used. The experimental design was in casual blocks in three treatments, CTL treatment (n = 15) with starch from corn; CR (n = 15) diet CTL plus chromium propionate; PF (n = 13) diet CTL plus calcium salts of palm oil. After weaning, 23 male lambs from these ewes were confined in individual stalls, with the same diet for 60 days, slaughtered. The data were analyzed using the SAS program, PROC GLM, and compared the means using Tukey's test at 5% probability. The maternal diet did not alter the dry matter intake, feeding efficiency, and average daily weight gain. Therefore, weights (weaning and slaughter) and carcass yield were higher for CR and PF groups than for CTL (P < 0.05). The treatment did not influence the loin eye area and fat thickness (P > 0.05). The spleen and the respiratory tract were smaller for PF and larger for CTL (P < 0.05). Leg weight was higher for CR. The perimeter and depth of the shank for the CR and PF lambs were higher, indicating an effect of maternal nutrition in this commercial cut. The CR group had a smaller epiphysis measurement and femur length than the CTL group. We concluded that the fetal programming effect in ewes fed with Cr propionate and Ca salts of palm oil benefited the progeny by increasing their body weight, better carcass yield, and a higher proportion of prime cuts.",

Notably, T3 must be consumed as it cannot be produced by the human body. Here, we reviewed the anti-inflammatory activities of T3s in the prevention and treatment of various inflammatory disorders; focusing on recent preclinical and clinical studies. There is compelling data from experimental models and human studies that shows that T3 administration can inhibit the release of various inflammatory mediators that contribute to age-related disease by enhancing oxidative stress, reducing melanin production and skin damage, and preventing cardiovascular disease and stroke. There is evidence to show that T3s possess neuroprotective, anticancer, and anti-osteoporosis properties. In addition, T3s also protect the gastrointestinal tract, facilitate blood glucose control in people with diabetes, and prevent fatty liver disease. Furthermore, results from some clinical studies suggest that T3s are beneficial nutritional supplements with no evident side-effects when administered to patients with neurological or cardiovascular disorders. There is growing evidence from clinical trials that shows that T3s can help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's disease. More well-designed clinical trials, as well as human intervention studies, are required to confirm the health benefits of palm T3.",

      "abstract": "The current study aims to explore the impact of palm oil fuel ash (POFA) heat treatment on the strength activity, porosity, and water absorption of cement mortar. The cement mortar mixtures were typically comprising cement or cement in combination with ultrafine treated POFA (u-TPOFA) which is the final form of the treated POFA, sand, water, and a superplasticizer. Before utilizing the u-TPOFA in mortar mixtures, the treatment processes of POFA were undertaken via five steps (drying at 105 ℃, sieving, grinding, heat treatment, re-grinding) to form u-TPOFA. The heat treatment was performed at three different heating temperatures (i.e., 550 ℃, 600 ℃, and 650 ℃). The ratio on mass/mass basis of the blended ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with u-TPOFA was OPC:u-TPOFA of 70%:30%. A total of four mixtures were prepared, consisting of a plain control mixture (designated as PCM) and three mixtures containing 30% of u-TPOFA treated at three different temperatures designated as M1 \"550 ℃,\" M2 \"600 ℃,\" and M3 \"650 ℃\". The results show that the optimum mixture was M2 which achieved the highest strength activity index (SAI) of 101.84% and 107% among all mixtures at 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Meanwhile, the porosity (P%) and water absorption (Abs%) of M2 exhibited the lowest values of 9.3% and 4.5%, respectively, among all the mixtures at 28 days. This superior performance of u-TPOFA treated at 600 ℃ represented in the M2 mixture was due to the formation of more binding phases consisting of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) type gel originated from a higher pozzolanic reaction and the filler effects caused by the fine u-TPOFA microparticles. These observations were further confirmed by the improved performance of the M2 mix among all the designed mixes which also exhibited better results in terms of bulk density (BD), ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as thermogravimetry (TGA) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM-EDX) analyses.",

      "abstract": "Palm oil has fulfilled most of the oil needs in the food sector in the world. However, palm oil is indicated to contain small amounts of compounds that are harmful to humans, especially to infants. These toxic contaminants are 3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD) esters and glycidyl esters (GE), which are formed during the deodorization of palm oil at high temperatures. This study aims to reduce the 3-MCPD ester concentration in refined, bleached, and deodorized palm oil (RBDPO) through adsorption using activated carbon. The activated carbons were treated with heat and acid-washing using HCl at various concentrations and were characterized. The treatment altered the physicochemical characteristics of the activated carbon (surface area, pore volume, pHPZC, and CEC), resulting in the enhancement of its adsorption characteristics (adsorption capacity). The activated carbon treated with 2 N HCl (AC 2 N) was chosen as the proper adsorbent, due to better surface area, better pore volume, highest CEC value, and better positive charge in RBDPO. The 3-MCPD and GE adsorption capacity of AC 2 N was 1.48 mg g-1 and 29.68 mg g-1, respectively. The adsorption ability of pretreated activated carbon towards 3-MCPD esters was examined in a batch system at various adsorption temperatures. The 3-MCPD ester concentration in RBDPO was successfully reduced by up to 80% at 35 °C using the activated carbon treated with 2 N HCl solution. On the other hand, the activated carbon was able to reduce the other contaminant of GE in RBDPO up to 97% from the initial concentration of GE."

The discharge of POME into the environment without any treatment processing could inflict an undesirable hazard to humans and the environment due to its high amount of toxins, organic, and inorganic materials. The treatment of POME prior to discharge into the environment is utmost required to protect the liability for human health and the environment. Biological treatments are preferable due to eco-friendly attributes that are technically and economically feasible. The goal of this review article is to highlight the current state of development in the biological processing technologies for POME treatment. These biological processing technologies are conducted in the presence of fungi, bacteria, microalgae, and a consortium of microorganisms. Numerous microbes are listed to identify the most efficient strain by monitoring the BOD, COD, working volume of the reactor, and treatment time. The most effective processing technology for POME treatment uses an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor with the COD value of 99%, hydraulic retention time of 7.2 days, and a working volume of 4.7 litres. Biological processing technologies are mooted as an efficient and sustainable management practice of POME waste."

This study aims to optimize electrocoagulation parameters such as operation time, electrodes gap and the initial pH by applying high current intensity to treat palm oil mill effluent (POME) via Box-Behnken design (BBD) method. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and suspended solids (SS) were used as the response variables in the quadratic polynomial model. Most of the selected models in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) have shown significant results. A high connection between the parameters and dependent variables was surprisingly discovered in this study which the obtained value of R2 for removal percentage of COD, BOD and SS were 0.9975, 0.9984 and 0.9979 respectively. Optimal removal was achieved at 19.07 A of current intensity (equivalent to 542 mA/cm2 of current density), 44.97 min of treatment time, 8.60 mm of inter-electrode distance and 4.37 of pH value, resulted in 97.21%, 99.26% and 99.00% of COD, BOD and SS removal respectively.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effect of hydromethanolic seed extract of Lepidium sativum on deep-fried palm oil diet induced NAFLDon male mice. METHODS: An experimental study design was conducted. Twenty-four male mice aged 8 to 10 weeks, weighing 32-42 g were divided into four groups. The four groups were divided into two controls and two treatments. Mice in normal control (C0) were administered only with the basal diet whereas negative control (C1) provided only with the deep-fried palm oil diet. The treatment groups T1, and T2 were administered with deep-fried palm oil diet and HMSELS at dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day, respectively for 28 days. Then on day 29, the mice were fasted overnight, anaesthetized and sacrificed by cervical dislocation after blood was taken by cardiac puncture for liver function tests while liver tissues were taken for histopathology investigation. RESULTS: The serum ALT and total bilirubin showed significant decrement whereas the serum albumin levels showed significant increment in T2 group. However, serum AST and ALP levels were decreased significantly in both T1 and T2 groups. Besides, the T2 group liver sections of mice were showed better effect of HMSELS on restoring the damaged liver histopathology almost toward normal. CONCLUSION: The HMSELS at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day (T2) was more effective on the liver function tests and liver histopathology that altered by feeding deep-fried palm oil diet. The good protective effect of HMSELS against deep-fried palm oil diet-induced NAFLD might be due to its antioxidant content."

      "abstract": "A life cycle assessment of anaerobic-treated palm oil mill effluent (POME) was conducted to assess the environmental performance on two integrated treatment processes: the typical hollow fiber membrane ultrafiltration module coupled with adsorption and electro-oxidation as pretreatment. The analysis was undertaken using the ReCiPe 2016 method and SimaPro v9 software was employed using a 'cradle-to-gate' approach. The results showed that hollow fiber membrane from the adsorption integrated membrane impacted significantly at 42% to 99% across all impact categories for both processes. Overall, the electro-oxidation integrated membrane was discovered to have a lesser environmental impact, particularly on the ozone formation (human health) (HOFP) at 0.38 kg NOx-eq in comparison to the adsorption integrated membrane at 0.66 kg NOx-eq. The total characterization factor of the endpoint category for human health is 8.61 × 10-4 DALY (adsorption integrated membrane) and 8.45 × 10-4 DALY (electro-oxidation integrated membrane). As membrane treatment is closely linked to energy consumption, the environmental impact with different sources of energy was evaluated for both processes with the impacts decreasing in the following order: Grid > Biogas > Grid/Solar. Future research should concentrate on determining the overall 'cradle-to-grave' environmental impact of treating POME, as well as other scenarios involving membrane treatment energy utilization using LCA. This study can help decision-makers in identifying an environmentally sustainable POME treatment and management, especially in Malaysia."

(hornwort) cultivation were investigated in this study. The results show that OPA + MPE solution with pH 9.3 and alkalinity 7525 mg CaCO3/L was obtained with 0.7 kg/L OPA loading. A pilot scale scrubber was used to study the effects of absorbent flow rates of 60-210 L/h on upgrading to 300 L/h field biogas stream. At 210 L/h, the CO2 removal efficiencies were 33% and 53% for MPE and OPA + MPE, respectively. To approach 100% H2S removal efficiency, the minimum flow rates were 120 L/h for MPE and 90 L/h for OPA + MPE. 50-150 g wet weight of hornwort in 30 L diluted POME were loaded to investigate appropriate initial hornwort loading level for hornwort cultivation. The highest specific growth rate of 0.045 day-1 with biomass production of 3.8 g/day were obtained with a 50 g initial loading. Among the wastewaters (MPE, OPA + MPE, and BSE) treatment using hornwort cultivation, the highest 0.035 day-1 specific growth rate and 2.6 g/day biomass production of hornwort were obtained in diluted BSE cultivation, and in 3 weeks of cultivation.

The Eco-Efficiency concept for palm oil mill waste utilization proposed in this study has a high potential for enhanced biogas upgrading by using OPA + MPE, and hornwort is a good candidate for BSE post-treatment integrated with biomass production.",

The reactor biomass was subjected to metagenomic study to investigate the impact on the anaerobic community dynamics. Experiments were conducted in two 5 L continuously stirred fill-and-draw reactors R1 and R2 operated at 30 ± 2 °C. Reactor R1 serving as control reactor was fed with unsonicated POME with HRT of 15 and 20 days (R1-15 and R1-20), whereas reactor R2 was fed with sonicated POME with the same HRTs (R2-15 and R2-20). The most distinct archaea community shift was observed among Methanosaeta (R1-15: 26.6%, R2-15: 34.4%) and Methanobacterium (R1-15: 7.4%, R2-15: 3.2%). The genus Methanosaeta was identified from all reactors with the highest abundance from the reactors R2. Mean daily biogas production was 6.79 L from R2-15 and 4.5 L from R1-15, with relative methane gas abundance of 85% and 73%, respectively. Knowledge of anaerobic community dynamics allows process optimization for maximum biogas production.",

This research explored the possibility of using dairy manure pellets (DMP) and palm oil mill effluent (POME) as alternative nutrient sources for Sporosarcina pasteurii cultivation and CaCO3 bioprecipitation. Different concentrations (20-80 g l-1 ) of DMP and POME were used to propagate the cells of S. pasteurii under laboratory conditions. The measured CaCO3 contents for MICP soil specimens that were treated with bacterial cultures grown in DMP medium (60%, w/v) was 15·30 ± 0·04 g ml-1 and POME medium (40%, v/v) was 15·49 ± 0·05 g ml-1 after 21 days curing. The scanning electron microscopy showed that soil treated with DMP had rhombohedral structure-like crystals with smooth surfaces, whilst that of POME entailed ring-like cubical formation with rough surfaces Electron dispersive X-ray analysis was able to identify a high mass percentage of chemical element compositions (Ca, C and O), whilst spectrum from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the vibration peak intensities for CaCO3 . Atomic force microscopy further showed clear topographical differences on the crystal surface structures that were formed around the MICP treated soil samples. These nutrient sources (DMP and POME) showed encouraging potential cultivation mediums to address high costs related to bacterial cultivation and biocementation treatment.",

      "abstract": "The reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from palm oil mill effluent (POME) is very significant to ensure aquatic protection and the environment. Continuous adsorption of COD in a fixed bed column can be an effective treatment process for its reduction prior to discharge. Adsorption capacity of bone derived biocomposite synthesized from fresh cow bones, zeolite, and coconut shells for the reduction in the organic pollutant parameter was investigated in this study in a fixed bed column. The effect of influent flow rate (1.4, 2.0, and 2.6 mL/min) was determined at an influent pH 7. The optimum bed capacity on the fabricated composite of surface area of 251.9669 m2/g was obtained at 1.4 mL/min at breakthrough time of 5.15 h influent POME concentration. The experimental data were fitted to Thomas, Adams-Bohart, and Yoon-Nelson models fixed bed adsorption models. It was revealed that the results fitted well to the Adams Bohart model with a correlation coefficient of R2 > 0.96 at different influent concentration. Adsorption rate constant was observed to increase at lower flow rate influent concentration, resulting in longer empty bed contact time (EBCT) for the mass transfer zone of the column to reach the outlet of the effluent concentration. In general, the overall kinetics of adsorption indicated that the reduction in COD from POME using a bone-biocomposite was effective at the initial stage of adsorption. The pore diffusion model better described the breakthrough characteristics for COD reduction with high correlation coefficient. Shorter breakthrough time compared to EBCT before regeneration indicated that the bone composite was suitable and effective for the reduction in COD from POME using fixed bed column adsorption."

To offer a coverage on the present less efficient technologies, the opportunities and challenges of advanced pretreatments that combine magnetic materials and natural composites as adsorbents are comprehensively reviewed here. Moreover, potential of various magnetic materials for POME pretreatment has been described. Several existing pretreatment methods such as physical pretreatments, chemical pretreatments, coagulation-flocculation, and adsorption can remove pollutant content from POME with certain limitations and the use of magnetic composite adsorbents can enhance the treatment efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Quality and food safety are of paramount importance to the palm oil industry. In this work, we investigated the practicability of ethylene gas exogenous application on post-harvested oil palm fruit bunches to improve the crude palm oil (CPO) quality. The bunches were first exposed to ethylene gas for 24 hr to induce abscission of palm fruits from bunches. The detached fruits were then subjected to heat treatment, mechanical extraction, clarification and drying to produce CPO. Critical quality parameters of CPO produced, that is free fatty acid, deterioration of the bleachability index and triacylglycerol showed improvement with ethylene gas treatment. Contaminant content that is phosphorus, chloride, iron, and copper also showed a reduction in the CPO derived from ethylene-treated bunches. These findings corresponded with low levels of contaminants such as 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters and glycidyl esters in refined oil. The implementation strategy and practicability of this method is herein proposed and discussed. Ethylene application not only improves the CPO quality, but could potentially enhance the process sustainability of palm oil mills."

Recommended diet regimen for diabetes is difficult to abide by especially for HFD as it adds flavour to the taste buds. In this study, palm oil-enriched HFD and normal diet were fed to nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetes rats, respectively for six weeks. Additionally, metformin, a common drug used to treat diabetes was given to rats under treatment groups. We evaluated the change of urinary metabolites of diabetes rats fed with palm oil-enriched HFD, and also after metformin treatment. Rats were divided into six-groups with different feeding diets, disease condition and with or without metformin treatment. Rats' urine were collected at the end of six weeks feeding program and subjected to 1H-NMR and multivariate data analysis to evaluate their metabolite profiles. At the early phase of diabetes, metabolites changes in diabetic rats were associated with the disease itself. Our data showed that continuous consumption of HFD altered various metabolic pathways of diabetic rats and caused detrimental effects to the rats. On the other hand, metformin treatment combined with normal diet lessened the physiological impacts caused by diabetes condition."

Five experimental diets were obtained by supplementing a basal diet with 6% of P (P6), 6% of SA (SA6), 4% of P + 2% SA (P4-SA2), 2% of P + 4% of SA (P2-SA4) and 6% of S (S6). A total of 480 one-d-old female broiler chickens (Ross 308) were housed in metabolic cages (6 cages/treatment, with 16 birds/cage). Replacing P with SA improved fat absorption at 11 and 35 d (p < 0.05), but not feed AME values and saturated FA (SFA) digestibility at 11 d. As age increased, the absorption of SFA and free fatty acids (FFA) improved, and the contribution of the upper ileum to FA absorption increased (p < 0.05). At 35 d, SA6 (56% FFA) and P2-SA4 (40% FFA, 2.6 unsaturated-to-saturated FA ratio) could replace S6 without impairing fat utilization. The replacement of P with SA represents a suitable strategy to use this by-product."

The organic foulant was characterized by biomass concentration and concentration of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The thicknesses of the cake layer and foulant were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The membrane morphology and inorganic elements were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Roughness of membrane was analyzed by atomic force microscopy. The results showed that the formation and accumulation of protein EPS in the cake layer was the key contributor to most of the fouling. The transmembrane pressure evolution showed that attachment, adsorption, and entrapment of protein EPS occurred in the membrane pores. In addition, the hydrophilic charge of proteins and polysaccharides influenced the adsorption mechanism. The composition of the feed (including hydroxyl group and fatty acid compounds) and microbial metabolic products (protein) significantly affected membrane fouling in the high-rate operation."

      "abstract": "By the year 2050, it is estimated that the demand for palm oil is expected to reach an enormous amount of 240 Mt. With a huge demand in the future for palm oil, it is expected that oil palm by-products will rise with the increasing demand. This represents a golden opportunity for sustainable biohydrogen production using oil palm biomass and palm oil mill effluent (POME) as the renewable feedstock. Among the different biological methods for biohydrogen production, dark fermentation and photo-fermentation have been widely studied for their potential to produce biohydrogen by using various waste materials as feedstock, including POME and oil palm biomass. However, the complex structure of oil palm biomass and POME, such as the lignocellulosic composition, limits fermentable substrate available for conversion to biohydrogen. Therefore, proper pre-treatment and suitable process conditions are crucial for effective biohydrogen generation from these feedstocks. In this review, the characteristics of palm oil industrial waste, the process used for biohydrogen production using palm oil industrial waste, their pros and cons, and the influence of various factors have been discussed, as well as a comparison between studies in terms of types of reactors, pre-treatment strategies, the microbial culture used, and optimum operating condition have been presented. Through biological production, hydrogen production rates up to 52 L-H2/L-medium/h and 6 L-H2/L-medium/h for solid and liquid palm oil industrial waste, respectively, can be achieved. In short, the continuous supply of palm oil production by-product and relatively, the low cost of the biological method for hydrogen production indicates the potential source of renewable energy.",

      "abstract": "Several agro-waste materials have been utilized for sustainable engineering and environmental application over the past decades, showing different degrees of effectiveness. However, information concerning the wider use of palm oil clinker (POC) and its performance is still lacking. Therefore, as a solid waste byproduct produced in one of the oil palm processing stages, generating a huge quantity of waste mostly dumped into the landfill, the waste-to-resource potential of POC should be thoroughly discussed in a review. Thus, this paper provides a systematic review of the current research articles on the several advances made from 2005 to 2021 regarding palm oil clinker physical properties and performances, with a particular emphasis on their commitments to cost savings during environmental and engineering applications. The review begins by identifying the potential of POC application in conventional and geopolymer structural elements such as beams, slabs, and columns made of concrete, mortar, or paste for coarse aggregates, sand, and cement replacement. Aspects such as performance of POC in wastewater treatment processes, fine aggregate and cement replacement in asphaltic and bituminous mixtures during highway construction, a bio-filler in coatings for steel manufacturing processes, and a catalyst during energy generation are also discussed. This review further describes the effectiveness of POC in soil stabilization and the effect of POC pretreatment for performance enhancement. The present review can inspire researchers to find research gaps that will aid the sustainable use of agroindustry wastes. The fundamental knowledge contained in this review can also serve as a wake-up call for researchers that will motivate them to explore the high potential of utilizing POC for greater environmental benefits associated with less cost when compared with conventional materials."

This study investigated the potential of commercial fertilizers as draw solution (DS) in FDFO to treat anaerobic palm oil mill effluent (An-POME). The process parameters affecting FO were studied and optimized, which were then applied to fertilizer selection based on FO performance and fouling propensity. Six commonly used fertilizers were screened and assessed in terms of pure water flux (Jw) and reverse salt flux (JS). Ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP), and potassium chloride (KCl) were further evaluated with An-POME. MAP showed the best performance against An-POME, with a high average water flux, low flux decline, the highest performance ratio (PR), and highest water recovery of 5.9% for a 4-h operation. In a 24-h fouling run, the average flux decline and water recovered were 84% and 15%, respectively. Both hydraulic flushing and osmotic backwashing cleaning were able to effectively restore the water flux. The results demonstrated that FDFO using commercial fertilizers has the potential for the treatment of An-POME for water recovery. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to address challenges such as JS and the dilution factor of DS for direct use of fertigation."

The highly polluting effluent is customarily treated by unsustainable open ponds with low efficiency, direct emissions, and massive land use. This study looks into an application of integrated anaerobic/oxic/oxic scheme for treatment of high strength palm oil mill effluent. The anaerobic reactors functioned as a prime degrader that removed up to 97.5% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD), while the aerobic reactors played a role of an effluent polisher that further reduced the COD. Their complementing roles resulted in a remarkable removal of 99.7%. Assessment of emission mitigation and biogas energy revealed that yearly energy of 53.2 TJ, emissions reduction of 239,237 tCO2 and revenue of USD 1.40 millions can be generated out of electricity generation and heating.

In this study, laccase producing microorganisms were isolated from POME samples collected in Côte d'Ivoire for their possible use in POME treatment. Strain showing the highest laccase activity was identified by ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region sequencing as Trametes polyzona. A maximum laccase production (156.3 U/mL) was obtained after 10 days of incubation under shaking condition, at 37 °C, pH 4, with starch (1%), tryptone (0.3%) and 10 mM of guaiacol. The partially purified laccase of 31 kDa exhibited maximum activity at 50 °C and pH 4.5 with a Km for guaiacol and Vmax of 0.7 mM and 0.04 mM/min, respectively. Metals, SDS and EDTA did not inhibit his activity. Used as biotreatment agent, T. polyzona MPS1-3 reduced COD, total suspended solids, total solids and total phenolics by 16.03%, 70.15%, 38.9%, 50.84%, respectively, for sterilized POME and by 13.09%, 58.07%, 36.53%, 42.05% for unsterilized POME. These results showed the promising application of T. polyzona for bioremediation of phenolics compounds in wastewater and it potentially useful in several other biotechnological applications.",

      "abstract": "In this work, waste cooking palm oil (WCPO)-based carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with encapsulated iron (Fe) nanoparticles have been successfully produced via modified thermal chemical vapor deposition method. Based on several characterizations, the dense WCPO-based CNT was produced with high purity of 89% and high crystallinity proven by low ID/IG ratio (0.43). Moreover, the ferromagnetic response of CNTs showed that the average coercivity and magnetization saturation were found to be 551.5 Oe and 13.4 emu/g, respectively. These produced WCPO-based CNTs were further used as heavy metal ions adsorbent for wastewater treatment application. Some optimizations, such as the effect of different adsorbent dosage, varied initial pH solution, and various heavy metal ions, were investigated. The adsorption studies showed that the optimum adsorbent dosage was 1.8 g/L when it was applied to 100 mg/L Cu (II) solution at neutral pH (pH 7). Further measurement then showed that high Cu (II) ion removal percentage (~80%) was achieved when it was applied at very acidic solution (pH 2). Last measurement confirmed that the produced WCPO-based CNTs successfully removed different heavy metal ions in the following order: Fe (II) > Zn (II) ≈ Cu (II) with the removal percentage in the range of 99.2 to 99.9%. The adsorption isotherm for Cu (II) was better fitted by Langmuir model with a correlation coefficient of 0.82751. WCPO-based CNTs can be a potential material to be applied as adsorbent in heavy metal ion removal.",

Considering the inevitable sensitivity of bacteria under environmental stresses, it is crucial to assess the survivability of both bacteria in the fluctuated environmental factors, proving their credibility as POME pollution bioindicators in the environment. In this study, the survivability of Alcaligenaceae and Chromatiaceae from facultative pond, algae (aerobic) pond and final discharge were evaluated under varying sets of temperature (25-40°C), pH (pH 7-9) and low/high total suspended solid (TSS) contents of POME collected during low/high crop seasons of oil palm, respectively. Following treatment, the viability status and compositions of the bacterial community were assessed using flow cytometry-based assay and high-throughput Illumina MiSeq, respectively, in correlation with the changes of physicochemical properties. The changes in temperature, pH and TSS indeed changed the physicochemical properties of POME. The functionality of bacterial cells was also shifted where the viable cells and high nucleic acid contents reduced at elevated levels of temperature and pH but increased at high TSS content. Interestingly, the Alcaligenaceae and Chromatiaceae continuously detected in the samples which accounted for more than 0.5% of relative abundance, with a positive correlation with biological oxygen demand (BOD5) concentration. Therefore, either Alcaligenaceae or Chromatiaceae or both could be regarded as the reliable and specific bacterial indicators to indicate the pollution in river water due to POME final discharge despite the fluctuations in temperature, pH and TSS.",

      "abstract": "The palm oil industry produces liquid waste called POME (palm oil mill effluent). POME is stated as one of the wastes that are difficult to handle because of its large production and ineffective treatment. It will disturb the ecosystem with a high organic matter content if the waste is disposed directly into the environment. The authorities have established policies and regulations in the POME waste quality standard before being discharged into the environment. However, at this time, there are still many factories in Indonesia that have not been able to meet the standard of POME waste disposal with the existing treatment technology. Currently, the POME treatment system is still using a conventional system known as an open pond system. Although this process can reduce pollutants' concentration, it will produce much sludge, requiring a large pond area and a long processing time. To overcome the inability of the conventional system to process POME is believed to be a challenge. Extensive effort is being invested in developing alternative technologies for the POME waste treatment to reduce POME waste safely. Several technologies have been studied, such as anaerobic processes, membrane technology, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), membrane technology, adsorption, steam reforming, and coagulation. Among other things, an AOP, namely photocatalytic technology, has the potential to treat POME waste. This paper provides information on the feasibility of photocatalytic technology for treating POME waste. Although there are some challenges in this technology's large-scale application, this paper proposes several strategies and directions to overcome these challenges."

      "abstract": "Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is highly polluted wastewater that is to the environment if discharged directly to water source without proper treatment. Thus, a highly efficient treatment with reasonable cost is needed. This study reports the coagulation treatment of POME using integrated copperas and calcium hydroxide. The properties of copperas were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Coagulation was conducted using jar test experiments for various coagulant formulations and dosages (1000-5000 mg/L), initial pH (4-10), stirring speed (100-300 rpm), and sedimentation time (30-180 min). The characterisation results show that copperas has a compact gel network structure with strong O-H stretching and monoclinic crystal structure. The effectiveness of integrated copperas and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) with the formulation of 80:20 removed 77.6%, 73.4%, and 57.0% of turbidity, colour, and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively. Furthermore, the integration of copperas and Ca(OH)2 produced heavier flocs (ferric hydroxide), which improved gravity settling. The coagulation equilibrium analysis shows that the Langmuir model best described the anaerobic POME sample as the process exhibited monolayer adsorption. The results of this study show that copperas with the aid of Ca(OH)2 demonstrated high potential in the removal of those parameters from POME with acceptable final pH for discharge. The utilisation of this by-product as a coagulant in effluent treatment can unlock the potential of copperas for wider applications, improve its marketability, and reduce gypsum waste generation from the TiO2 industry.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for water, food and energy poses challenges for the world´s sustainability. Tropical palm oil is currently the major source of vegetable oil worldwide with a production that exceeds 55 million tons per year, while generating over 200 million tons of palm oil mill effluent (POME). It could potentially be used as a substrate for production of microalgal biomass though. In this study, the microalgal strain Chlamydomonas biconvexa Embrapa|LBA40, originally isolated from a sugarcane vinasse stabilization pond, was selected among 17 strains tested for growth in POME retrieved from anaerobic ponds of a palm oil industrial plant located within the Amazon rainforest region. During cultivation in POME, C. biconvexa Embrapa|LBA40 biomass productivity reached 190.60 mgDW • L-1 • d-1 using 15L airlift flat plate photobioreactors. Carbohydrates comprised the major fraction of algal biomass (31.96%), while the lipidic fraction reached up to 11.3% of dry mass. Reductions of 99% in ammonium and nitrite, as well as 98% reduction in phosphate present in POME were detected after 5 days of algal cultivation. This suggests that the aerobic pond stage, usually used in palm oil industrial plants to reduce POME inorganic load, could be substituted by high rate photobioreactors, significantly reducing the time and area requirements for wastewater treatment. In addition, the complete mitochondrial genome of C. biconvexa Embrapa|LBA40 strain was sequenced, revealing a compact mitogenome, with 15.98 kb in size, a total of 14 genes, of which 9 are protein coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the strain taxonomic status within the Chlamydomonas genus, opening up opportunities for future genetic modification and molecular breeding programs in these species.",

Only a few mills installed a bio-polishing plant to treat POME further before its final discharge. The present study aims to determine the quality and toxicity levels of POME final discharge from three different mills by using conventional chemical analyses and fish (Danio rerio) embryo toxicity (FET) test. The effluent derived from mill A which installed with a bio-polishing plant had lower values of BOD, COD and TSS at 45 mg/L, 104 mg/L, and 27 mg/L, respectively. Only mill A nearly met the industrial effluent discharge standard for BOD. In FET test, effluent from mill A recorded low lethality and most of the embryos were malformed after hatching (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 20%). The highest toxicity was observed from the effluent of mill B and all embryos were coagulated after 24 h in samples greater than 75% of effluent (38% of half-maximal lethal concentration (LC50) at 96 h). The embryos in the effluent from mill C recorded high mortality after hatching, and the survivors were malformed after 96 h exposure (LC50 = 26%). Elemental analysis of POME final discharge samples showed Cu, Zn, and Fe concentrations were in the range of 0.10-0.32 mg/L, 0.01-0.99 mg/L, and 0.94-4.54 mg/L, respectively and all values were below the effluent permissible discharge limits. However, the present study found these metals inhibited D. rerio embryonic development at 0.12 mg/L of Cu, and 4.9 mg/L of Fe for 96 h-EC50. The present study found that bio-polishing plant installed in mill A effectively removing pollutants especially BOD and the FET test was a useful method to monitor quality and toxicity of the POME final discharge samples.",

Over the years, palm oil mill has been rising at alarming rate in Malaysia, causing palm oil-based wastes to increase especially palm oil mill effluent (POME). POME in Malaysia are channelled into water bodies such as rivers after treated mostly with conventional biological method. However, with current technologies and knowledge, conventional POME treatments are seen to be outdated and require major improvements as greenhouse gaseous are emitted to the environment as well as being less cost effective. Integrated systems that combine two or more conventional methods are introduced and reviewed to provide insights on the advantages and disadvantages of the system if it is to be implemented in real life plant. Integrated systems that focus on combining conventional methods are compiled and reviewed specifically for POME treatment. Among the integrated methods that are reviewed includes biological with membrane, adsorption with magnetic field exposure, adsorption with membrane and electrocoagulation with membrane. The systems are seen to give excellent color, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) removal with average of higher than 90%. Reduction in space utilization, improved treatment time as well as simplified operating system were reported when integrated systems are applied as compared to conventional treatment of POME.",

The removal of residual oil from palm oil-water mixture (POME model) using the progressive freezing process was investigated. An optimization technique called response surface methodology (RSM) with the design of rotatable central composite design was applied to figure out the optimum experimental variables generated by Design-Expert software (version 6.0.4. Stat-Ease, trial version). Besides, RSM also helps to investigate the interactive effects among the independent variables compared to one factor at a time. The variables involved are coolant temperature, X A (4-12 °C), freezing time, X B (20-60 min), and circulation flow, X C (200-600 rpm). The statistical analysis showed that a two-factor interaction model was developed using the obtained experimental data with a coefficient of determination (R 2) value of 0.9582. From the RSM-generated model, the optimum conditions for extraction of oil from the POME model were a coolant temperature of 6 °C in 50 min freezing time with a circulation flowrate of 500 rpm. The validation of the model showed that the predicted oil yield and experimental oil yield were 92.56 and 93.20%, respectively."

      "abstract": "Background: Preeclampsia is a significant cause of maternal and perinatal mortality worldwide. Oxidative stress plays a key role in its pathophysiology, hence antioxidants such as tocotrienol may be preventive against preeclampsia. In 2018, the ISSHP revised the definition of preeclampsia. In accordance with the new definition, we report a secondary data analysis from a clinical trial comparing palm oil vitamin E in the form of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) against placebo, in preventing preeclampsia. Method: A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted in 2002-2005 to assess the benefits of TRF in preeclampsia prevention. A total of 299 primigravidae were recruited. The intervention group was supplemented with TRF 100 mg daily in super-olein capsules, whereas the placebo group was prescribed super-olein capsules without TRF, beginning from 12 to 16 gestational weeks until delivery. The primary outcome measure was incidence of preeclampsia. Results: The total incidence of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) was 5%, whereas the incidence of preeclampsia was 2.3%. The odds of developing PIH (adjusted OR 0.254; 95% CI: 0.07-0.93; p-value 0.038) and preeclampsia (adjusted OR 0.030; 95% CI: 0.001-0.65; p-value 0.025) were significantly lower in the TRF arm compared to the placebo arm. Conclusion: Antenatal supplementation with palm oil vitamin E in the form of TRF is associated with significant reductions in the incidence of preeclampsia and PIH in a single urban tertiary hospital. Palm oil vitamin E deserves further scrutiny as a potential public health preventive measure against preeclampsia and PIH."

      "abstract": "The formation of struvite crystals or magnesium ammonium phosphate (MgNH4PO4) in palm oil mill effluent (POME) occurs as early as in the secondary stage of POME treatment system. Its growth continues in the subsequent tertiary treatment which reduces piping diameter, thus affecting POME treatment efficiency. Hypothesis. The beneficial use of the crystal is the motivation. This occurrence is rarely reported in scientific articles despite being a common problem faced by palm oil millers. The aim of this study is to characterize struvite crystals found in an anaerobic digester of a POME treatment facility in terms of their physical and chemical aspects. The compositions, morphology and properties of these crystals were determined via energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Solubility tests were carried out to establish solubility curve for struvite from POME. Finally, crystal growth experiment was done applying reaction crystallization method to demonstrate struvite precipitation from POME. Results showed that high phosphorous (P) (24.85 wt%) and magnesium (Mg) (21.33 wt%) content was found in the struvite sample. Elemental analysis detected carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) below 4 wt%. The crystals analysed by XRD in this study were confirmed as struvite with 94.8% struvite mineral detected from its total volume. Having an orthorhombic crystal system, struvite crystals from POME recorded an average density of 1.701 g cm-3. Solubility curve of struvite from POME was established with maximum solubility of 275.6 mg L-1 at pH 3 and temperature 40 °C. Minimum solubility of 123.6 mg L-1 was recorded at pH 7 and temperature 25 °C. Crystal growth experiment utilizing POME as the source medium managed to achieve 67% reduction in phosphorous content. This study concluded that there is a potential of harnessing valuable nutrients from POME in the form of struvite. Struvite precipitation technology can be adapted in the management of POME in order to achieve maximum utilization of the nutrients that are still abundant in POME. At the same time maximization of nutrient extractions from POME will also reduce pollutants loading in the final discharge."

As a continuity, current study evaluated the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) in a concise manner, subsequently discussed its practicality in palm oil industry of Malaysia. Indeed, TiO2-photocatalysis displays a promising technical feasibility in treating POME, but its wide application is economically-suppressed. It is positing that biological-based treatments (including the existing open-ponding system) are more likely to be employed as the major treating approach for POME over TiO2-photocatalysis. This is particularly true as biological-based treatments offer better performance index for concentrated POME with comparatively lower treatment cost and technicality needed. Furthermore, it is also prevailed with high biogas generability, therefore being irreplaceably benchmarked for POME treatment in Malaysia. Instead of replacing biological treatment entirely, the adoption of TiO2-photocatalysis as complementing tertiary treatment for biological-treated-POME is more practical, bestowed to its robust organic-mineralizing feature for low concentration POME. Such integrated system is expected to augment the POME degradation efficiency, hence effectively preserve the environment from POME pollution.",

      "abstract": "Thriving oil palm agroindustry comes at a price of voluminous waste generation, with palm oil mill effluent (POME) as the most cumbersome waste due to its liquid state, high strength, and great discharge volume. In view of incompetent conventional ponding treatment, a voluminous number of publications on non-conventional POME treatments is filed in the Scopus database, mainly working on alternative or polishing POME treatments. In dearth of such comprehensive review, all the non-conventional POME treatments are rigorously reviewed in a conceptual and comparative manner. Herein, non-conventional POME treatments are sorted into the five major routes, viz. biological (bioconversions - aerobic/anaerobic biodegradation), physical (flotation & membrane filtration), chemical (Fenton oxidation), physicochemical (photooxidation, steam reforming, coagulation-flocculation, adsorption, & ultrasonication), and bioelectrochemical (microbial fuel cell) pathways. For aforementioned treatments, the constraints, pros, and cons are qualitatively and quantitatively (with compiled performance data) detailed to indicate their process maturity. Authors recommended (i) bioconversions, adsorption, and steam reforming as primary treatments, (ii) flotation and ultrasonication as pretreatments, (iii) Fenton oxidation, photooxidation, and membrane filtration as polishing treatments, and (iv) microbial fuel cell and coagulation-flocculation as pretreatment or polishing treatment. Life cycle assessments are required to evaluate the environmental, economic, and energy aspects of each process."

Biological treatment using sequencing batch reactor (SBR) augmented with palm oil fuel ash (POFA) was investigated for the first time. The performance of POFA in enhancing biological treatment of wastewater has not been tested. The porosity property of POFA can improve SBR efficiency by promoting growth of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and formation of larger flocs for settling and facilitating attachment of microorganisms and pollutants onto POFA surfaces. The properties of POFA were tested to identify morphological properties, particle size, surface area, chemical compositions. Four SBRs, namely SBR1, SBR2, SBR3 and SBR4 were provided with aeration rate of 1, 2, 3 and 4 L/min, respectively. Each reactor was augmented with different dosages of POFA. Optimum aeration rate and POFA concentration were identified by the performance of SBRs in removing chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) and colour from domestic wastewater. The results showed the most efficient COD (97.8%), NH3-N (99.4%) and colour (98.8%) removals were achieved at optimum POFA concentration of 4 g/L in SBR and aeration rate of 1 L/min. The study also found that higher aeration rate would contribute to the smaller specific size of flocs and decrease the pollutant removal efficiency.",

      "abstract": "In predicting palm oil mill effluent (POME) degradation efficiency, previous developed quadratic model quantitatively evaluated the effects of O2 flowrate, TiO2 loadings and initial concentration of POME in labscale photocatalytic system, which however suffered from low generalization due to the overfitting behaviour. Evidently, high RMSE (131.61) and low R2 (-630.49) obtained indicates its insufficiency in describing POME degradation at unseen factor ranges, hence verified the fact of poor generalization. To overcome this issue, several models were developed via machine learning-assisted techniques, namely Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Supported Vector Machine (SVM) and Regression Tree Ensemble (RTE), subsequently being assessed systematically. To achieve high generalization, all models were subjected to 'train-all-test-all' strategy, 5-fold and 10-fold cross validation. Specifically, GPR model was furnished with high accuracy in 'train-all-test-all' strategy, judging from its low RMSE (1.0394) and high R2 (0.9962), which however menaced by the risk of overfitting. In contrast, despite relatively poorer RMSE and R2 (1.7964 and 0.9886) obtained in 5-fold cross validation, GPR model was rendered with highest generalization, while sufficiently preserving its accuracy in development process. Besides, SVM and RTE models were also demonstrated promising R2 (0.9372 and 0.9208), which however shadowed by their high RMSEs (4.2174 and 4.7366). Furthermore, the extraordinary generalization of GPR model was coincidentally verified in 10-fold cross validation. The lowest RMSE (2.1624) and highest R2 (0.9835) obtained with feature number of 36 asserted its sufficiency in both generalization and accuracy prospect. Other models were all rendered with slight lower R2 (> 0.9), plausibly due to the higher RMSE (> 4.0). According to GPR model, optimized POME degradation (52.52%) can be obtained at 70 mL/min of O2, 70.0 g/L of TiO2 and 250 ppm of POME concentration, with only ∼3% error as compared to the actual data.",

      "abstract": "Residual palm oil that goes into the river untreated can become detrimental to the environment. Residual oil discharge during milling process into palm oil mill effluent (POME) is unavoidable. About 1 wt% of residual oil in POME causes major problems to the mills, in terms of environment, wastewater treatment and economy losses. This paper reports the recovery of residual oil from POME by adsorption on polypropylene micro/nanofiber (PP-MNF) and desorption of oil by hands pressing, and oil extraction from the PP-MNF using solvent and supercritical-CO2 extraction techniques. The characterization of the PP-MNF and the quality of oil extracted were analyzed using analytical instruments. The reusability of the PP-MNF was also investigated. The experimental results showed the adsorption capacity of the PP-MNF was 28.65 g of oil/g of PP-MNF on average using refined palm oil, whilst recovery of oil from POME was 10.93 g of oil/g of PP-MNF. The extraction yield of oil from PP-MNF using hand pressing was 89.62%. The extraction of residual oil from the pressed PP-MNF showed comparable yield between solvent and supercritical CO2 techniques. The quality of recovered oil was similar with the quality of the crude oil, and no trace of polypropylene contamination was detected in the oil recovered. The PP-MNF showed no significant physical change after the extraction process. In conclusion, the PP-MNF has great potential to be used commercially in residual oil recovery from POME.",

The presence of high contents of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, and suspended solids (SS) in PORE encourages the determination of an effective treatment process to minimize the environmental pollution and preserve aquatic life. In the present study, a biodegradable natural polymer, namely tannin, was utilized as a coagulant to treat PORE. The coagulation experiment was conducted using a jar test apparatus. The tannin coagulation efficiency was evaluated based on the BOD, COD, turbidity, and SS removal from PORE by varying the tannin dose (50-300 mg/L), pH (pH 4-10), treatment time (15-90 min), and sedimentation time (15-90 min). It was found that the maximum removal of BOD, COD, turbidity, and SS was 97.62%, 88.89%, 93.01%, and 90.21%, respectively, at pH 6, a tannin dose of 200 mg/L, 60 min of coagulation time, and 60 min of sedimentation time. Analyses of isotherm models revealed that the Freundlich isotherm model was well fitted with the coagulation study. Kinetics studies show that the pseudo-second-order kinetics model was the well-fitted kinetics model for the BOD, COD, turbidity, and SS removal from PORE using tannin as a polymeric coagulant. The determination of thermodynamics parameters analyses revealed that BOD, COD, turbidity, and SS removal from PORE was spontaneous, exothermic, and chemical in nature. The finding of the present study shows that tannin as a natural polymeric coagulant would be utilized in PORE treatment to avoid toxic sludge generation."

In this study, immobilized microalgae cells are used for removing pollutants in treated palm oil mill effluent (TPOME). Different ratios of microalgae beads to TPOME concentration were examined at 1:2.5, 1:5, and 1:10. The biomass concentration and COD removal were measured through a standard method. The color of the cultivated microalgae beads changed from light green to darker green after the POME treatment for 9 days, hence demonstrating that microalgae cells were successfully grown inside the beads with pH up to 9.84. The immobilized cells cultivated in the POME at 1:10 achieved a higher biomass concentration of 1.268 g/L and a COD removal percentage of 72% than other treatment ratios. The increment of the ratio of microalgae cells beads to POME concentration did not cause any improvement in COD removal efficiency. This was due to the inhibitory effect of self-shading resulting in the slow growth rate of microalgae cells which responsible for low COD removal. Therefore, this system could be a viable technology for simultaneous biomass production and POME treatment. This will contribute to research efforts toward the development of new and improved technologies in treating POME.",

In this work, palm oil-based polyester polyol (PPP) derived from epoxidized palm olein and glutaric acid was reacted with isophorone diisocyanate to produce an aliphatic polyurethane, without the incorporation of any commercial petrochemical-based polyol. The effects of water content and isocyanate index were investigated.

The polyurethanes with comparable thermal stability, yet susceptible to enzymatic degradation with 7-59% of mass loss after 4 weeks of treatment. The polyurethanes demonstrated superior water uptake (up to 450%) and did not induce significant changes in pH of the medium. The chemical changes of the polyurethanes after enzymatic degradation were evaluated by FTIR and TGA analyses. The polyurethanes showed cell viability of 53.43% and 80.37% after 1 and 10 day(s) of cytotoxicity test; and cell adhesion and proliferation in cell adhesion test. The polyurethanes produced demonstrated its potential as biomaterial for soft tissue engineering applications."

This review explores the effects of palm oil and its liquid fraction namely palm olein, which is commonly used as cooking oil on four lipid parameters; total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), which play an important role as CVD-related biomarkers. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify the relevant studies on palm oil and the lipid parameters specifically focusing on the in-vivo animal model. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline via EBSCOhost, Medline via OVID and Scopus. Studies were limited to the English language published between the years of 2000 and 2019. The main inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Study with in-vivo animal experiments [the animal should be limited to mammals] (2) Study should have evaluated the effects of palm oil or palm olein on plasma or serum lipid parameter (3) Study should have used palm oil or palm olein in the form of pure or refined oil (4) The treatment of palm oil or palm olein was assessed using the following outcomes: plasma or serum TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C concentration (5) Study should have control group and (6) studies on specific fatty acid, fraction enriched tocotrienol and tocopherol, crude palm oil, kernel oil, red palm oil, thermally oxidized palm oil, hydrogenated palm oil, and palm oil or palm olein based products namely margarine, palm milk, butter and cream were excluded. The quality and the risk of bias on the selected studies were assessed using the ARRIVE Guideline and SYRCLE's Risk of Bias tools, respectively. Results: The literature search successfully identified 17 potentially relevant articles, whereby nine of them met the inclusion criteria. All research articles included in this review were in vivo studies comprising seven rats, one hamster and one mice model. Conclusion: Significant positive outcomes were observed in several lipid parameters such as TC and LDL-C. The evidence from this review supported that palm oil and palm olein possess high potential as lipid-lowering agents."

There were no interactions for CS inclusion and the inclusion of FAPO on final body weight (FBW), DMI, ADG, G:F, hot carcass weight (HCW), LM area, marbling, or calculated yield grade (CYG; P ≥ 0.15). There was no significant difference for FBW, DMI, ADG, G:F, HCW, marbling, or CYG for cattle fed with or without FAPO (P ≥ 0.13). However, there was a quadratic response for FBW, ADG, G:F, HCW, marbling, and CYG with increased inclusion of CS (P ≤ 0.04). Inclusion of FAPO had no effect on performance. Feeding CS at greater inclusions decreased daily gain and feed efficiency but increased FBW when fed to an equal fat endpoint. CS gave greater returns ($/animal) when fed at 80% of diet DM. Feeding greater amounts of CS can be an economical way to finish cattle. In this study, FAPO did not affect animal performance, carcass characteristics, or economic return."

      "abstract": "Four strains of bioflocculant-producing bacteria were isolated from a palm oil mill effluent (POME). The four bacterial strains were identified as Pseudomonas alcaliphila (B1), Pseudomonas oleovorans (B2), Pseudomonas chengduensis (B3), and Bacillus nitratireducens (B4) by molecular identification. Among the four bacterial strains, Bacillus nitratireducens (B4) achieved the highest flocculating activity (49.15%) towards kaolin clay suspension after eight hours of cultivation time and was selected for further studies. The optimum conditions for Eriochrome Black T (EBT) flocculation regarding initial pH, type of cation, and B4 dosage were determined to be pH 2, Ca2⁺ cations, and a dosage of 250 mL/L of nutrient broth containing B4. Under these conditions, above 90% of EBT dye removal was attained. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FT-IR) analysis of the bioflocculant revealed the presence of hydroxyl, alkyl, carboxyl, and amino groups. This bioflocculant was demonstrated to possess a good flocculating activity, being a promissory, low-cost, harmless, and environmentally friendly alternative for the treatment of effluents contaminated with dyes."

      "abstract": "Approximately 900 tonne of crude palm oil (CPO) underwent washing using 5 to 10% hot water (90 to 95°C) at a palm oil mill. The aim of the CPO washing was to eliminate and/or reduce total chlorine content present in the conventional CPO, as it is known as the main precursor for the formation of 3-monochloropropane-1, 2-diol esters (3-MCPDE). By a simple hot water washing, more than 85% of the total chlorine was removed. However, washing did not have significant (p > 0.05) effect on other oil quality parameters such as the deterioration of bleachability index (DOBI), free fatty acid (FFA) content and diacylglycerol (DAG) content of the oil. The latter has been established as the main precursor for glycidyl esters (GE) formation. The treated CPO was then transported using tankers and further refined at a commercial refinery. Refining of washed CPO resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) lower formation of 3-MCPDE, but GE content remained slightly high. Post-treatment of refined oil significantly reduced the GE content (p < 0.05) to an acceptable level whilst almost maintaining the low 3-MCPDE level. The study has proven that water washing of CPO prior to refining and subsequent post-refining is so far the most effective way to produce good quality refined oil with considerably low 3-MCPDE and GE contents. Dry fractionation of refined palm oil showed these contaminants partitioned more into the liquid olein fraction compared to the stearin fraction.",

The commonly applied ponding treatment methods have been reported inefficient for remediating the concentration of the colorants before discharge. The need for sustainable and efficient treatment technique is crucial in order to preserve the environment. In this view, this study reported the first attempt to decolorize POME using a proliferate Klebsiella Pneumonia ABZ11 at varied inoculum sizes of 5-25% (v/v), initial color concentration (650-2,600 ADMI) and treatment time of 5-40 h. The treatment conditions were optimized using Response Surface Methodology. At optimal conditions of 20% (v/v) inoculum size, initial-color concentration of 2,600 ADMI, initial pH of 7 and 35 h treatment retention time, over 80.40% color removal was achieved with insignificant disparity compared with the model predicted value of 81.538%. Also, the Monod model excellently described the decolorization kinetic process with 0.9214 coefficient of correlation (R 2), and the calculated maximum growth μ max ) and half-saturation constant (K s ) were 7.023 d-1 and 340.569 ADMI d-1, respectively. This study revealed that the Klebsiella Pneumonia ABZ11 was highly prolific and such feature may favor a synergistic biodegradation process."

However, the effects of palm oil mill effluent (POME) on fish early life stages are still unexplored. Therefore, the objective of this present study was to elucidate the impact of POME on the early life stages of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fertilized eggs of Nile tilapia were exposed to four concentrations of POME (0, 1.565, 2.347, and 3.130 mg/L) in 20 plastic funnels. Each of the control and treatment groups was maintained in five replicates. The cumulative hatching rate, malformation rate, body length, and deformities of larvae were analyzed. Results showed that hatching rate and survival rate of Nile tilapia larvae significantly decreased with increasing concentrations of POME. In contrast to, malformation rate and heart rate were significantly increased. Furthermore, results showed several malformations of Nile tilapia larvae including lordosis, kyphosis, and curved tail when exposed to 1.565 mg/L, 2.347 mg/L, and 3.130 mg/L of POME concentrations. Further research is required to understand the physiological mechanisms of different endpoints in the early stages of Nile tilapia induced by the toxicity of POME.",

The strain AK04 was able to rapidly metabolize all ten phenolics as single and mixed substrates at all test concentrations. With single substrates, between 78 and 98% removal was achieved within seven days. The biomass yield increased with increasing concentration from 100 to 500 mg L-1 but slightly decreased when the concentration was increased up to 1,000 mg L-1. When fitted to a Haldane model, the groups of benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives gave significantly higher maximum specific growth rates than other phenolics. Phenol exhibited the lowest affinity and highest inhibitory effects on fungal metabolism. In mixed substrates, the total concentration ranges of phenolics mixtures between 1,000 and 6,000 mg L-1 did not affect the fungal growth rate and the strain AK04 showed a high degree of resistance to their toxic effects. The addition of glucose and yeast extract enhanced the degradation rates of individual phenolics in the substrate mixtures, demonstrating the advantage of this strain for treating complex media, such as industrial wastewater.",

      "abstract": "For the controversy still existed about the oxidation stability of the high oleic oils compared with palm oil (PO), this study was aimed to explore the possible reason causing the controversies. Total polar compounds (TPC) was used to evaluate the oxidation stability of oils. Results showed there exist two kinds of lineal changes about the content of total polar compounds (TPC) in each oil, which were closely linked with the fatty acid composition and the tocochromanols content. The possible influence of the initial quality of oils also should be considered. The TPC of high oleic peanut oil (HOPO), high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO), high oleic rapeseed oil (HORO) and PO increased slowly at the initial period mainly owing to the antioxidation of tocochromanols, then sharply after 24, 48, 36 and 72 h respectively, when tocochromanols in each oil almost reduced below the detection limit. After that, the major factor would be fatty acids, particularly PUFA. It showed that the major tocochromanols in different oils (e.g. α, γ-tocotrienols in PO, α, γ-tocopherols in HORO and HOPO, and α-tocopherols in HOSO), could impose the main effects of inhibiting the TPC generation in the initial thermal treatment. The TPC in HORO significantly increased after 84 hours of heat process, which might be caused by the higher content of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (i.e. C18:2 and C18:3). However, the content of the saturated fatty acid (SFA) did not show statistically significant change during the thermal treatment.",

The present study aimed to formulate, characterize, and improve the oral bioavailability of PTX using SNEDDS. The formulated SNEDDS consisted of palm oil, Capmul® MCM, and Tween® 80 as oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant, respectively. The mixture design module under the umbrella of the design of experiments was used for the optimization of SNEDDS. The dynamic light-scattering technique was used to confirm the formation of nanoemulsion based on the globule size, in addition to the turbidity measurements. In vivo bioavailability studies were carried out on male Wistar rats. The pharmacokinetic parameters upon oral administration were calculated using the GastroPlus software. The optimized SNEDDS had a mean globule size of 165 nm with minimal turbidity in an aqueous medium. Bioavailability of PTX increased 1.5-folds (AUC = 1013.30 ng h/mL) as SNEDDS than the pure drug with an AUC of 673.10 ng h/mL. In conclusion, SNEDDS was seen to enhance the bioavailability of PTX and can be explored to effectively control the incidents of intermittent claudication.",

However, the effects of the wastewater on the phytoremediator plants, in term of growth performance, lignocellulosic composition, and the presence of nutrients and heavy metals in the plants are not yet well studied. In the present work, we demonstrated that POME FD increased the growth of P. purpureum. The height increment of P. purpureum supplied with POME FD (treatment) was 61.72% as compared to those supplied with rain water (control) which was 14.42%. For lignocellulosic composition, the cellulose percentages were 38.77 ± 0.29% (treatment) and 34.16 ± 1.01% (control), and the difference was significant. These results indicated that POME FD could be a source of plant nutrients, which P. purpureum can absorb for growth. It was also found that the heavy metals (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni and Pb) inside the plant were below the standard limit of the World Health Organization (WHO). Since POME FD was shown to have no adverse effects on P. purpureum, further research regarding the potential application of P. purpureum following phytoremediation of POME FD such as biofuel production is warranted to evaluate its potential use to fit into the waste-to-wealth agenda."

In this study, we investigated the effect of the tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF), a potent antioxidant, against diabetes-induced changes in retinal layer thickness (RLT), retinal cell count (RCC), retinal cell apoptosis, and retinal expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in rats. Additionally, the efficacy of TRF after administration by two different routes was compared. The diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Subsequently, diabetic rats received either oral or topical treatment with vehicle or TRF. Additionally, a group of non-diabetic rats was included with either oral or topical treatment with a vehicle. After 12 weeks of the treatment period, rats were euthanized, and retinas were collected for measurement of RLT, RCC, retinal cell apoptosis, and VEGF expression. RLT and RCC in the ganglion cell layer were reduced in all diabetic groups compared to control groups (p < 0.01). However, at the end of the experimental period, oral TRF-treated rats showed a significantly greater RLT compared to topical TRF-treated rats. A similar observation was made for retinal cell apoptosis and VEGF expression. In conclusion, oral TRF supplementation protects against retinal degenerative changes and an increase in VEGF expression in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic retinopathy. Similar effects were not observed after topical administration of TRF.",
