      "abstract": "Motion sickness (MS) is a disabling condition dominated by disagreement between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement, with symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, and nausea, and other autonomic disabling symptoms. Preparations of Griffonia simplicifolia, containing high concentrations of 5-HTP, might be effective for serotonin-related disorders, including MS. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the G. simplicifolia/magnesium complex in a pediatric population with MS. The Griffonia/magnesium complex (50 and 200 mg, respectively) was orally administered as a prophylactic therapy for MS twice a day for 3 months to group A, and no therapy for MS was administered to group B. The MS clinical signs were recorded by parents or, where possible, directly from children by a specific module, which included validated questions for the diagnoses that were administered to all subjects and parents of both groups. Two study groups were matched for age (P=.224), sex (P=.801), and z-score body-mass index (P=.173). At T0, all recruited subjects in both groups complained about MS. After 3 months (T1), group A showed an MS prevalence of 36%, significantly lower than MS prevalence in group B (73%) (P<.001). The findings of the present study suggest the role of the Griffonia/magnesium complex as a potential treatment with middle-term efficacy even for MS.",

      "abstract": "The management of overweight may include the use of dietary supplements targeted to counter the feeling of hunger. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial has been performed in 20 overweight females. These subjects were randomly assigned to supplement their diet with either an extract from Griffonia Simplicifolia (10 subjects) or a placebo (10 matched subjects) for 4-weeks, in conjunction with a personalised reduced calorie diet. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, by the assessment of 24-h urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels (5-HIAA), of 1-month administration of a dietary supplement containing 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) from botanical extracts in healthy, overweight females. Secondary endpoints were the assessment of sensation of appetite (by Haber score), body composition, and severity of binge eating. The supplemented group had a significant increase of 24-h urinary 5-HIAA levels (p<0.001), and a decrease in Haber score (p<0.001) while the placebo group did not show significant changes. With regard to changes in body composition, statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were found for the mean change in BMI, suprailiac skinfold thicknesses, arm circumference and hip circumference. Other parameters were found to be similar in the treated and in the placebo groups. In conclusion, this study shows that the 5-hydroxytryptophan present in the Griffonia extract, administered via spray to the oral cavity, is adequately absorbed, as confirmed by the increase in 24-h urinary 5-HIAA, and that the supplementation of the diet of overweight women with 5-hydroxytryptophan increases the feeling of satiety associated with a decrease in BMI.",

In the present study we investigated the influence of the plant extract on male sexual behavior. The seed extract was orally administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats at three dose levels (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) both acutely and subchronically (daily for 9 days). Mating test with receptive female rats was performed 60 min after the acute treatment or the last dose when repetitively administered. Mount, intromission and ejaculation latencies and post-ejaculatory interval were recorded. Food intake and body weight were measured over the 9-day period of treatment. Microdialysis technique was used to detect the extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in rat brain following the acute administration of the extract dosed at 100mg/kg. The acute treatment significantly increased mount latency (at any dosage), intromission and ejaculation latencies (at 100 mg/kg) and post-ejaculatory interval (at 50 and 100 mg/kg). On the contrary the subchronic treatment failed to exert a significant influence on copulatory behavior. The daily administration of the extract dosed at 50 and 100 mg/kg for 9 days significantly reduced food intake and body weight. Finally in the microdialysis experiments we found a dramatic increase in 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA.",

In spite of the modern therapeutic application of Griffonia simplicifolia seed extract in mood disorders, no scientific evidence has been provided till now. For this reason the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of Griffonia simplicifolia seed extract on anxiety behavior. Griffonia simplicifolia seed extract, dosed at 1, 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg, was orally administered in rats which were submitted to the dark-light test and open field test, 60 min after the treatment. In the dark-light test, the administration of the extract at the doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg was able to significantly increase the time spent in the light compartment (P<0.05). In the open field test, the extract dosed at 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg induced an anti-tigmotactic effect, as indicated by a significant increase of time spent in the central area of the open field (P<0.01). In conclusion these findings indicate that Griffonia simplicifolia seed extract exerts anxiolytic-like effect in rats and suggest its potential usefulness for the treatment of anxiety in humans.",

      "abstract": "At present Griffonia simplicifolia is used in food supplement aimed to treat mood disorders as well as to reduce food intake and body weight. The plant has gained increasing interest for its high content in 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) particularly in the seed. The present study was designed to evaluate the influence of a seed extract of the plant, dosed at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, on the sexual behavior of ovariectomized hormone-primed rats after acute and subchronic treatment. The single administration of G. simplicifolia significantly reduced lordosis response and increased rejection behavior in female rats treated with the highest dose while it did not influence proceptive behaviors. On the other hand the subchronic administration of the extract significantly reduced proceptivity but not receptivity, and increased rejection behavior. All the tested dosages were able to markedly decrease food intake and body weight after a 9-day treatment. Taken together the present results, possibly ascribed to increased levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the brain, suggest a cautious administration of the plant extract owing to its negative influence on female sexual behavior.",

An HPLC method has been developed for the direct assay of 1 in seeds of G. simplicifolia which overcomes the problems associated with previous techniques. By optimising the solvent extraction procedures and the HPLC conditions, levels of 1 could be estimated following a single-step seed extraction. The chromatographic conditions, solvent system and the extraction technique developed make this method relatively simple, fast and efficient. Using the described methods, the highest ever levels of 1 (namely, 20.83% on a fresh weight basis) have been determined in seeds of G. simplicifolia obtained in Ghana.",

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, (1998) 15123-15128]. However, these results were inconclusive as to whether these residues function as direct defense determinants through carbohydrate binding, or whether substantial changes of the protein structure had occurred in mutated proteins, with this structural disruption actually causing the loss of biochemical and biological functions. Evidence shown here supports the former explanation: circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra showed that mutations at carbohydrate-binding residues of GSII do not render it dysfunctional because of substantial secondary or tertiary structure modifications; and trypsin treatment confirmed that rGSII structural integrity is retained in these mutants. Reduced biochemical stability was observed through papain digestion and urea denaturation in mutant versions that had lost carbohydrate-binding ability, and this was correlated with lower Ca(2+) content. Accordingly, the re-addition of Ca(2+) to demetalized proteins could recover resistance to papain in the carbohydrate-binding mutant, but not in the non-binding mutant. Thus, both carbohydrate binding (presumably to targets in the insect gut) and biochemical stability to proteolytic degradation in situ indeed contribute to anti-insect activity, and these activities are Ca(2+)-dependent.",

We purified Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin-II (GSA-II)-binding mucus glycoprotein (GMG) from rat gastric mucosa by solubilization in a guanidine-containing buffer, gel permeation chromatography, Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I)-affinity chromatography and GSA-II-affinity chromatography. Rat GMG showed high molecular weight on a Sephacryl S-1000 column, and a single band in 0.5% agarose-2% polyacrylamide composite gels and blots. A protein of approximately 60 kDa was contained in the GMG preparation. GMG was deglycosylated with trifluoromethanesulphonic acid treatment. An antibody was raised against deglycosylated GMG (deGMG). The antibody recognized deGMG, GMG, periodic acid-treated deGMG and O-glycanase-digested deGMG, but did not react to trypsin-digested deGMG. These results suggest that the antibody recognizes proteinase-sensitive region or peptide backbone of GMG. In immunohistochemistry, the mucous gel layer of the stomach luminal surface was stained with antibody. The antibody recognized not only gastric mucous neck cells and pyloric gland cells, but also gastric surface mucous cells, mucous cells in the duodenal gland, and goblet cells in the small intestine and colon. These results indicate that GMG is a component of rat gastric mucus, and that the antibody recognizes mucous-secreting cells in rat stomach and intestine.",

      "abstract": "Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages (m phi), upon binding the lectin Griffonia simplicifolia IB4 (GSIB4) at the plasma membrane, are induced to secrete several low molecular weight proteins. In this investigation, results from specific ELISA and immunoprecipitation analysis of these molecules confirmed that the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), belongs to the group of elicited proteins. This specific m phi response is directly influenced by the dose of GSIB4 used and the time in contact with the cells. At 40 micrograms/ml GSIB4, the maximum dose of lectin used, the m phi activity was equal to that achieved when the cells were incubated with an interferon-gamma/lipopolysaccharide (IFN/LPS) stimulus alone. Moreover, the data showed that TNF-mediated tumoricidal activity was significantly influenced by GSIB4 binding to the m phi membrane. When the lectin was incubated alone or in sequence with IFN/LPS, this ligand-receptor binding promoted the lysis of WEHI 164 tumor target cells. However, concurrent incubation of both IFN/LPS and GSIB4 with m phi significantly diminished the tumoricidal response. This suggested that one of the metabolic pathways utilized subsequent to receptor-ligand binding was altered by these interactions. When cyclic AMP (cAMP) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) levels were examined, the results showed that the concentration of cAMP was unchanged despite the fact that IP3 levels were significantly enhanced upon m phi-GSIB4 binding. Collectively, the data show that GSIB4 binding to specific glycoproteins in the m phi membrane induces TNF-alpha production and facilitates TNF-alpha dependent tumoricidal responses. It also appears that the transduction of the signal, in part, at least utilizes the phosphatidyl inositol pathway. Finally, it is noteworthy that m phi activity is influenced by the sequence in which GSIB4 is presented to the m phi relative to the IFN/LPS treatment.",

      "abstract": "Thioglycollate elicited peritoneal (TG-Møs) but not resident peritoneal Møs (R-Møs) were found to bind the lectin Griffonia simplicifolia isotype I-B4 (GSI-B4). This was demonstrated by ultrastructural studies and FACS analyses. Membranes from TG-Møs were isolated, separated on SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose, and exposed to peroxidase-labeled GSI-B4. These procedures revealed two major membrane glycoproteins of molecular weights 180,000 and 94,000 daltons that bound the lectin GSI-B4 which has a specificity for recognizing terminal alpha-galactosyl residues. The presence of these epitopes on the two membrane glycoproteins was further substantiated by the fact that treatment of the membranes with alpha-galactosidase destroyed their capacity to bind GSI-B4 and that alpha-D-galactopyranoside but not N-acetyl-D-glucosamine competitively inhibited GSI-B4 from binding to the glycoproteins. Treatment of TG-Møs with GSI-B4 reduced the capacity of interferon (IFN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or IFN alone, to induce Mø mediated cytotoxicity towards tumor cells by as much as 40%. GSI-B4 also caused alterations in the pattern of biosynthetically 35S-methionine labeled secreted proteins as early as 2 hours after contact with TG-Møs. Out of 35 discernible proteins on fluorograms of SDS-PAGE separated proteins, 5 were down-regulated and 9 were enhanced. It is suggested that the two novel Mø membrane proteins may play a role in regulating the response of Mø subpopulations to their humoral and cellular environments.",

      "abstract": "Individual single-cell-cloned cell lines of the different rat mammary (Rama) cell types have been tested for their ability to bind the lectins Griffonia simplicifolia-1 (GS-1) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) using fluorescent, histochemical, and radioactive assays. Myoepithelial-like cell lines isolated from neonatal rat mammary glands and from nonmetastasizing tumors strongly bind GS-1 and PWM, whereas the corresponding epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines do not. When the epithelial cell lines are grown on floating gels of polymerised rat tail collagen, the basally situated or peripheral cells are stained strongly with peroxidase-conjugated lectins, whereas the apically or luminally situated cells are unstained. The capacity of cell lines intermediate in morphology between epithelial and myoepithelial-like cells to bind to GS-1 is as follows: Rama 25 epithelial less than Rama 25-12 less than Rama 25-11 less than Rama 25-14 less than Rama 29 myoepithelial-like cells, the same order as for other markers of myoepithelial cells. Conjugated PWM, however, binds only to the myoepithelial-like cell lines. Treatment of Rama 25 epithelial cells with agents that disrupt microtubules accelerates their conversion to elongated, myoepithelial-like cells in culture. The binding of cells to GS-1 is observed prior to, and that to PWM after, the major morphological change. It is suggested that the stepwise appearances of carbohydrate receptors for GS-1 and PWM mark discrete stages in the differentiation of epithelial to myoepithelial-like cells in culture, in the same way that they mark similar differentiation stages in ductal development in mammary glands of prepubertal rats.",

Griffonia simplicifolia) termed BS-I, strongly reacts with murine IgD and with no other protein in ascites including all other classes of immunoglobulins as determined by immunoprecipitation, hemagglutination inhibition and affinity binding. Based on this finding, murine IgD could be rapidly purified directly from whole ascitic fluid by passage over affinity beads of BS-I linked to Sepharose 4B and subsequent elution by a buffer containing 0.1 M D-galactose. The sugar eluted product is 95-99% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and represents 90-95% of the total IgD in the initial ascites by ELISA assay. Both monomeric and dimeric murine IgD may be purified by this procedure. Human IgD is unreactive with this lectin. Treatment of purified IgD with endoglycosidases that remove either O- or N-linked glycosides indicates that BS-I binds to IgD only via N-linked carbohydrate chains.",

      "abstract": "The TSH receptor from Triton-solubilized bovine microsomal membranes was found to bind to a substantial extent to columns of the immobilized lectins Bandeiraea (Griffonia) simplicifolia I, Ricinus communis I, wheat germ, and Concanavalin A, whereas it was not retained by Dolichos biflorus. Elution of TSH receptor activity from these lectins could be achieved with the appropriate saccharides in all cases except Concanavalin A. The most extensive adsorption of the receptor occurred on B. simplicifolia I-agarose (84%), and the terminal alpha-D-galactosyl specificity of this interaction was substantiated by its susceptibility to alpha-galactosidase treatment. Whereas TSH itself was not bound to this immobilized lectin, a complex of this hormone with its receptor did interact and could be eluted with methyl-alpha-D-galactoside. Purification (800-fold) of the bovine TSH receptor was achieved by a combination of TSH and B. simplicifolia I affinity chromatographies. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified TSH receptor after radioiodination revealed three major components with apparent mol wt of 316,000, 115,000, and 54,000.",

Specificity of Griffonia simplicifolia I reaction with carbohydrate determinants at the cell surface is shown by (i) ability of alpha-galactosidase treatment of intact cells to abolish all lectin binding whereas beta-galactosidase has no effect on lectin binding, (ii) ability of methyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside to completely inhibit lectin binding with methyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside having no effect on lectin binding, (iii) ability of brief treatment of intact cells with trypsin to liberate a glycopeptide but reacts with G. simplicifolia I to form a precipitate that is dissolved by addition of methyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside or alpha-galactosidase, (iv) ability of methyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside (but no other monosaccharide) to completely inhibit avid binding of macrophages to G. simplicifolia I lectin immobilized on an insoluble support, and (v) ability of immobilized lectin to separate macrophages into highly pure subpopulations of lectin-reactive and lectin-unreactive cells, as shown by examination of fluorescein-labeled lectin-treated cells with phase-contrast/fluorescence microscopy.",
